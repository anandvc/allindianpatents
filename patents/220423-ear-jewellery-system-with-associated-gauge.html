				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Ear jewellery system comprises ear jewellery (1) and an associated gauge (2) for optimal adaptation of the ear jewellery (1) on the ear lobe. The ear jewellery (1) has a U shaped recess (5), which, with its internal width (7) is intended to be pushed from below over the ear lobe (16), which is to be fitted. The recess (5) then takes precisely the thickness of the ear lobe (16) in the condition, in which it is pulled down and stretched. Instead of adapting the recess directly to the measured thickness, an insert can also, with corresponding thickness, be put i~ the recess. The suitable internal width (7) is determined by means of a gauge (2), appropriate to the system, from multiple number of separate gauges (3). The separate gauges (3) have mouths (8) with graded internal widths (12) and tongues (9) with thickness (13), corresponding with the respective internal widths (7). With the help of a measurement of an ear lobe (16) to be fitted, in its stretched condition, by means of these separate gauges (3), the suitability ear jewellery is ascertained from a series of ear jewellery with U shaped recesses, having different internal widths (7).</td>

The invention relates to an ear Jewellery system with associated gauge having very special type of ear Jewellery which distinguishes itself through the special fastening system. Furthermore, the invention includes gauges so that the ear Jewellery becomes individually suitable for an ear lobe, which is an important pre-requisite for wearing comfort of the ear Jewellery. This system is suitable for fashion Jewellery as well as for pure ornamentation.<br>
In the conventional fastening of ear Jewellery, basically two types of fastening are distinguishable. According to the first type, the ornament can be attached to one pricked hole in the ear lobe. Occasionally other parts of the body are also perforated in similar fashion, for example, the edges of the ear or wings of the nose to fix an ornamental ring thereon. The piece of Jewellery or just the ear Jewellery then shows a needle, which is pushed through the hole and is secured at its tip with a catch, somewhat in the shape of a safety-clip, to prevent the piece of Jewellery from falling out. This catch mechanism is often unappealing. It has to be of a definite size so that it can be used effortlessly and, therefore, it remains visible from behind in many cases, which does not give the right impression.<br><br>
The second type of fastening is provided In the Jewellery itself and is clipped on the ear or on the wing of the nose. The ear Jewellery, known as ear cFips, consists of. for example, a clamping arrangement, where both the clamp parts are pressed against each other by a spring. For putting on the ear Jewellery, the ear clips are opened by spreading apart both the clamp parts against the spring force, and the ear Jewellery is pushed over the ear lobe and then both the clamp parts hold the ear lobe, which lies in between them. The ear Jewellery is held onto the ear lobe by means of static friction. The bigger and heavier the ear Jewellery is, the stronger must be the contact pressure of the clamp parts and with that the spring force to make the ear Jewellery stick securely on the ear. If the spring force is too small, the static friction is too less and in case the head shakes abruptly, the Jewellery would slip off the ear. This fastening method is, in fact, practical for putting on and off the ear Jewellery but has the disadvantage that it causes almost always some pain, specially when the Jewellery is worn permanently. The clamping arrangements mostly are of standard construction, which give rise to such contact pressure that every current type of Jewellery is to some extent held securely. After a couple of minutes of wearing the Jewellery, the pain, caused by the qiamps, subsides, so that it no longer troubles excessively. If, however, worn for a prolonged period, invariably the pain becomes perceptible again. Till today, there is no ear Jewellery, which is stuck on the ear lobe with spring force, which allows a pain- free and reliable wearing for a prolonged duration. The heavier and bigger the attached Jewellery, the more serious is the problem. Wearing the ear clips so far has been, without exception, associated with more or less a strong sensation of pain; that is why many persons give up on wearing such type of ear Jewellery, although they find the same attractive on aesthetic grounds and would have loved to wear them.<br>
It is, therefore, the object of the present invention to create an ear Jewellery system, which ensures that the ear Jewellery remains simple in its operation while putting it on or off, further does not trigger a feeling of pain for bigger and heavier Jewellery even when worn for a long period and moreover deploys a fastening system, which can be produced in a more cost effective and simpler way than the conventional spring loaded clamping arrangement and which - after the ornament<br><br>
has been put on - is not visible from any side. In an embodiment, the system should offer additional security against inadvertent or conscious removal of the ear Jewellery by thieves. According to the present system, the ear Jewellery should be individually selectable according to the respective ear lobe of the wearer, wherein the standard sizes are selectable for the different sizes of ear lobes, conforming straightaway then to the respective ear lobes.<br>
This objective is fulfilled through an ear Jewellery system with associated gauges selected from separate gauges for optimum fitment of the ear Jewellery on the ear lobe, which distinguishes itself thereby that the ear Jewellery has a U shaped recess, which, with its internal width or the internal width of an insert, to be placed into it from below is defined to be pushed on the ear lobe, stretched for the purpose of fitting, thereby taking up exactly the thickness of the stretched ear lobe, wherein the suitable internal width can be decided with the help of an appropriate gauge from a multiplicity of separate gauges with respective mouths having graded internal widths and tongues having thickness of the respective internal width, so that by a measurment of the ear lobe to be fitted in stretched condition with the help of these separate gauges, the suitable internal width can be decided of the U shaped recess of the relevant ear Jewellery or of the insert to be inserted from a series of ear Jewellery or series of inserts with U shaped recesses of different internal widths.<br>
The core of the system lies therein, that firstly the thickness of the ear lobe is measured individually in stretched-through-pulling condition and secondly the ear Jewellery, having a recess which confonns exactly to this thickness of the ear lobe decided by the stretched condition, is held purely through adhesion force on the ear lobe after the ear lobe swells back again when the ear Jewellery has been put on and the pulling force has been removed. The individual measurement takes place preferably with a standardised scale, so that an ear lobe with a known unit of measurement and in stretched condition straightaway can be matched with an ear Jewellery of appropriate width of the U shaped recess or its insert and the Jewellery is held securely on it after the stretching is removed. This system for holding the Jewellery on an ear lobe is not visible from outside, and thus, tire holding system is<br><br>
totally integrated in the inside of the Jewellery. It goes without saying that the system can be implemented merely as support for attaching the actual ear Jewellery .<br>
An example of implementation of this ear Jewellery system is shown in the drawings and the system with few pieces of ear Jewellery as example and also gauges associated with the system comprising calibrated separate gauges are described below and the functioning of the system in all details is explained.<br>

Figure 1 shows the ear Jewellery system with the essential parts, namely a single piece of ear Jewellery 1 and below it the associated gauges 2 comprising a number of separate gauges 3. The piece of ear Jewellery 1 here makes for a plain ornament, made out of a suitable material, which may be precious metal, stainless steel, aluminium, plastic or even stone, wood or glass. In the shown sketch, the ear Jewellery is an ellipse shaped disc of about 2 to 3 mm thickness, about 25 mm length and 15 mm width. From this elliptical disc, from its pointed side along the length axis 4, a U shaped recess 5 is taken out. The recess 5 has a fine toothed (serrated) surface, so that a complete row of longish barbs are formed. The barbs can also serve as receiving guide for a correspondingly built insert 25, which is held back by the barbs or for hollow ear Jewellery piece 1, the barbs can be partly opened, so that the swollen -again ear lobe finds more room and can anchor itself further inside the piece of ornament. As alternative, the recess can also have smooth or etched rough inner walls 6. similar to the rubbing surface of a match box. This piece of ear Jewellery 1 can be made out of solid material or can also be a hollow body. The latter can so come about that the piece of ear Jewellery 1, depending on the production technique, first remains open inside on the side facing the recess 5 and these open sides aftenwards are closed with the help of a thin material strip, either by soldering, welding, click fixing, pushing in or sticking of suitable band shaped strips. In accordance with this special ear Jewellery system, as speciality, the internal width 7 of the recess 5 must match exactly with the thickness of an ear lobe, and for that matter with the thickness of an ear lobe in its stretched condition, when it is pulled down with a hand along its length. The ear Jewellery is therefore produced in a complete series, wherein the individual pieces 1 of a series differentiate themselves through the measurement of their internal widths 7. The ear Jewellery pieces 1 are therefore produced in a complete series of graded widths 7, in'the same manner as finger rings of a specific ornament type are produced in different sizes or diameters. The U shaped recess 5 on the ear Jewellery is about 10 mm to 15 mm long and their internal widths 7 measures<br><br>
between 2 mm to 8 mm. Most of the wearers of the ear Jewellery would require a width 7 between 4mm and 6mm. The narrowest widths 7 are used by young girts when they are children and the biggest widths are used by corpulent persons. A series of a ear Jewellery type can then be produced in steps of internal widths 7, with widths of 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, .... 7.5, 8 mm. Naturally still finer steps can be selected. Below the ear Jewellery 1 in Fig. 1, an appropnate gauge 2 is illustrated. This consists of a number of loose separate gauges 3, which have in each case a mouth 8 and a tongue 9 and which are shown here in a stack. These separate gauges can have a hole 10, so that they do not get lost and then they can be held together by a wire ring 11, which passes through the holes 10 of all the separate gauges, whereby these are arranged in a sequence according to their graded width 12 or sizes. For each separate gauge 3, the internal width 12 of the mouth 8 corresponds exactly with the width 13 of the tongue 9. At the top and bottom, the separate gauges are provided with a scale 28, that means with fine lines 29, which are, for example, spaced apart at 1mm. Besides, through every separate gauge 3 extends a slit, and on one side through its mouth 8 a slit 30 and on the other side, through its tongue 9 a slit 31, which extends right up to the tip of the tongue and is therefore open there. The function of the scale 28 and the slits 30,31 will be explained in relation to the description of the functioning of the System. Few precise gauges can be punched from a paper board or can be injection moulded in a plastic part, wherein the separate gauges lie next to each other. Gauges so produced lend themselves well for distribution in the dispatch business and for occasional use of the Jewellery in private households, as these are very reasonably priced. Similar flat gauges are already in use for determination of ring size of the finger rings.<br>
For a better understanding of the ear Jewellery system. Figure 2 shows all the components of a possible complete set of a type of ear Jewellery. It comprises then a complete series of ear Jewellery pieces 1 of the same type with U shaped recesses 5 of different internal width and separate gauges 3, appropriate for these different widths. The separate gauges 3 are preferably made out of plastic or wood, so that they become light and possess a small heat capacity and thermal conductivity, with the intention that when they are put on an ear lobe, as is<br><br>
described later, practically no heat transfer takes place. Putting on an ear lobe, which is to be measured, is much more pleasant for the sample person than it is with a gauge made of steel, which would immediately take away much heat from the ear lobe. The ends 14 of the gauges 3 on the open side of their mouths 8 are rounded, so that these do not prick or scratch an ear lobe while being put on. As is indicated in the three lowermost separate gauges 3, their mouths 8 can also have a definite inner form ; this is to take into consideration the fact that all the ear lobes over their length do not have a uniform thickness, but become thicker or thinner somewhat towards their bottom etc. Even then the inner sides of these recesses can be provided with fine barbs ( not shown here), as shown in Figure 1, or these inner sides can otherwise have a rough surface. A set of separate gauges 3 can be made available for every ear lobe form. In similar fashion, also the inner shape of the recesses 5 on the pieces of ear Jewellery 1 can be made differently, as is indicated with hatched areas in the three lowermost ear Jewellery pieces 1.<br>
An enlarged view of a piece of ear Jewellery with its U shaped recess 5 as per the ear Jewellery system is shown in Figure 3. The inner walls 6 of the U shaped recess 5 can remain free depending upon the material quality or are fitted with a rubber foil or a rubber like foil material 15, for example a foil material made of Neoprene, for which again a rough surface or a surface provided with barbs are helpful. The material to be used consists of a backing fabric made of 100% polyamide and is coated with a stretchable raw rubber. The inner walls 6 of the U shaped recess 5 are then fitted with one such foil 15 made of this or similar material through lamination. Such foil material has high frictional resistance against the skin and guarantees a firm hold of the Jewellery put on an ear lobe. As shown in Figure 3 by means of dashed lines, the foil 15 itself can be shaped to be a part of the Jewellery in a manner that it towers above the recess 5 on one or both sides and makes, for example, a fan shaped decoration 32. In another variant, the recess can also be coated with a rubber foil, having a special surface with so called nano humps. One such uses the adhesion effect, which brings forth the feet of Geckos, which, as is well known, makes it possible for lizard like animals to move over polished glass walls or ceiling, wherein their feet engage directly with the molecular structure of the wall. The feet of these animals have millions of finest<br><br>
hair at the sole of the feet, from which each of them fans out to the tip in thousands of small buds. The brush like construction of the hairs brings the Gecko- feet so close in contact with the foundation that attractive forces, which usually are present between individual atoms and molecules, work - the so called Van der Waals forces - that is forces due to electrostatic interaction between atoms or molecules, when the spacing amounts to few atom diameters. At the University of California, Berkeley it was successful to produce rubber pieces with similar surfaces, which had nano humps in them.<br>
(Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Online Publication, dated 27"^ August, 2002; www.pnas.orq/cQi/content/abstract/l92252799v1).<br>
It is shown in Figure 4, how the thickness of an ear lobe 16 is measured with the help of a separate gauge 3. As shown here on a right ear 17, the left hand 18 catches with index finger and thumb the ear lobe 16 and pulls it down as is indicated by the arrow, so that it stretches and becomes thinner thereby. Then the right hand 19 pushes forward a separate gauge 3 with its mouth 8 or its U shaped recess or its ends 14 over the ear lobe, which has been thus stretched. Simply one such separate gauge 3 is chosen, whose mouth 8 can be put straight over the stretched ear lobe 16. If the left hand 18 lets go the ear lobe 16, it can again retract and its thickness swells up a little bit. After this, the separate gauge 3 is held with accurate registration and securely on the relaxed ear lobe 16. With a little pull downwards of the separate gauge 3, the firmness of the seat can be tested. The scale 28 only permits to determine, how far the mouth 8 of the separate gauge 3 can be put over the ear lobe 16, because every ear lobe is not equally long. Further, a needle can be pushed through the slit 30, so that, if need be, it can be pushed through the hole 33, which is already available in the ear lobe. The position of the needle can aftenA^ards be read off the scale, so that it can be precisely defined on the ear Jewellery later, where a safety needle must be positioned. When these measurement steps have been carried out, the ear lobe is again pulled down with one hand, so that it stretches and with the other hand then the separate gauge 3 can easily be withdrawn from the ear lobe.<br>
In Figure 5 it is shown how the separate gauge 3 is now used to determine<br><br>
the piece of ear Jewellery, which would match with the measured thickness of the ear lobe. Its tongue 9 is used to find out the right size of the ear Jewellery piece, or the right internal width 7 of the recess 5 on one such ear Jewellery piece as per the system or for the determination of an insert with the right width, which, depending on the configuration, can be placed in the recess 5 of the ear Jewellery. It is with advantage that the U shaped recess 5 on the piece of ear Jewellery 1 is lined with a rubber or rubber like foil, or its inner surfaces are roughened by etching, so that they have the similar roughness as on the rubbing surface of a matchbox. The recess 5 of different ear Jewellery pieces 1, which are thus coated or treated, are now pushed over the tongue 9 of the suitable separate gauge 3, whereby the recess 5 should be able to be pushed straight over the tongue 9. When this happens, the matching ear Jewellery piece has been found. Afterwards it is put on the ear lobe, wherein the ear lobe is again pulled down with one hand, so that it is stretched and the piece of Jewellery 1 with its recess 5 is pushed over it. The Jewellery piece 1 is pushed on the ear lobe in its stretched condition, and thereafter the ear lobe is let loose, so that the tension is released and it returns to its relaxed state with little amount of swelling. A secure and highly comfortable mating seat for the ear Jewellery piece, which has been put on in this manner, is thus ensured. As shown in Figure 1, when the surfaces of the inner sides of the recess are provided with barbs instead of a plastic insert, the Jewellery piece holds even firmer because then the swollen up ear lobe snuggles up aginst these barbs.<br>
In Figure 6, a piece of ear Jewellery 1 with an appropriate insert 25 is shown, the insert having on its part the same width, which matches with the measured thickness of the ear lobe. The insert shows here springs 34 with a dovetailed profile, which fit into the same grooves 35 in the recess 5 on the Jewellery piece 1, so that the pushed -in insert is held firmly in the recess 5. Instead of grooves 35 and springs 34, holes and knops can also be used, which engage in each other, or sidewise barbs on the insert 25 and the recess 5, which, when the insert is pushed in, engage with each other. The ear Jewellery 1 here is provided with a horizontal slit 20 of approximately 1 mm width, which is used for putting in a safety needle ; safety needles generally have a thickness of 0.8 mm. The associated insert 25 also is provided with such a horizontal slit 26, which<br><br>
however is dosed due to the rubber like quality of the insert and is opened only when the safety needle is put through it, which is explained later. The inner sides of the recess on the insert 25 can be provided with barbs, same as already shown in Figure 1, to increase its hold on an ear lobe.<br>
In Figure 7, a piece of ear Jewellery, pushed in this manner on an ear lobe, is shown. Essential is the recess on the Jewellery piece as well as the width of this recess or the width of an insert, pushed into the recess. This width is made to match quite individually with the thickness of an ear lobe and is basically measured and determined on an ear lobe, stretched through pulling. As shown in the Figure, the bottom part of the ear Jewellery can be shaped and formed as per one's liking. In the example shown here, the ear Jewellery is made overall bell shaped and is fitted with four stones. It is just as well that an ear Jewellery can be made as creole, as shown in Figure 8, or it can be made as a holder or support for attaching the real Jewellery.<br>
An example of pure Jewellery is shown in Figure 9. This ear Jewellery can be made from Titanium, for example, and is then specially light. On the other hand, it can also be made out of Gold or Platinum or out of Silver and can be subsequently gold plated and fitted with Diamonds 37. In that case it is specially valuable. For such ear Jewellery, it is advisable not to carry it on the ear lobe only through adhesion effect but also to secure against it getting pulled off or slipping off. For this purpose, the ear Jewellery is provided with a pocket shaped slit 20 starting from its one side, as was mentioned for the ear Jewellery in Figure 6, the slit extending over the recess 5 and building a pocket there, as is indicated by the dashed lines. The inner walls of the recess 5 are coated with a rubber like, foamed foil 15. This ear Jewellery can be secured on the ear lobe, when the ear lobe of the wearer is pierced, which is indeed the case with many ladies or can be brought about, if need be. Yet in comparison with the conventional Jewellery, which are worn on pierced ear lobes, the holder of this ear Jewellery functions quite differently. In conventional Jewellery, the weight of the ornament essentially hangs from the needle, which is inserted ithrough the hole of the ear lobe. When someone wears relatively heavy ear Jewellery over many years, the holes in the<br><br>
ear lobes become larger and the ear lobes often become shapeless. In the proposed solution given here, however, the needle 21 serves only as safety for the ornament, not for its prolonged holding on the ear lobes . In the manner, described in detail above, the ear Jewellery is made to conform to the ear lobe, stretched through pulling, and for putting it on, is only pushed from below with its U shaped recess over the ear lobe, which is stretched by one hand, and even with the side with the slit 20 turned against the head. When the ear lobe is let loose, that is after the tension is released, the ear lobe regains its shape and swells somewhat, through which the ear Jewellery is adequately held. In principle, the ear Jewellery could have been worn in this fashion. For safety, additionally a needle 21 with a gri[j head 24, which itself can be built as an ornament, is inserted from the open side of the slit 20 ; it passes through the foil 15, right through the recess 5 and thus through the hole in the ear lobe, and after that through the foil 15 at the other side of the recess 5 and then in the slit 20 there. The needle 21 can be placed anywhere over the cross region 22 of the slit 20, depending upon the position of the hole in the ear lobe. The exact location of the needle 21 is likewise determined with the help of the separate gauge. To this end, the separate gauges have similar slits 30,31 and also a sidewtse scale 28 with fine lines 29. When the separate gauge 3 is pushed in, the safety needle 21 is put through the existing hole on the ear lobe and its location can be read off the scale 28. The separate gauge 3 is now placed in recess 5 on the Jewellery piece 1 and in the measured position then a hole can be drilled through the Jewellery piece or if the clear slit 20 is at one's disposal, the correct position of insertion can be marked, and aftenvards, the needle 21 can be inserted at this position through the slit 20 and the foil 15. The appropriate needle 21 for the Jewellery system has preferably a ball shaped tip 26. This expands the foil 15 when it is passed through the same and prevents afterwards the slipping off of the needle 21 as the ball shaped tip works like barb. The same thing happens when the recess 5 on the piece of Jewellery is fitted with an insert 25 of the measured width, the insert on its part having a slit 27 for putting in the safety needle 21, as is shown in Figure 6. The advantage of this system with the slit 20 also lies therein that the needle 21 can be moved to certain extent in a step less way within the slit 20, which means that the position of the needle 21 at the Jewellery piece can be made to match precisely with the hole on the ear lobe of<br><br>
the wearer. In every position, the needle pricks through the foil 15 or the Insert 25 and the Jewellery piece is consequently secured. The Jewellery 1, so secured through the needle 21, is, however, attached only to the recess 5 while being worn. No force acts on the needle 21. When the Jewellery 1 is worked upon by higher forces other than merely its own weight and pulled on the ear lobe, the needle comes into use during wearing. Then the piece of Jewellery 1 remains hanging on the needle, after it has been first moved at the front end 23 of the of the slit 20. This needle 21 even allows a height adjustability of the ear Jewellery on the ear lobe. The needle can be put in at any desired place within the slit 20 through the foamed foil 15 or the slit 27 on the insert 25. Correspondingly, an ear Jewellery with its recess 5 can be pushed over partly over an ear lobe and then the needle is put in through the foamed foil 15 or the insert 25 at that place, where the hole on the ear lobe is. If the ear Jewellery is so put on, it is held only partially by the recess 5 as a result of adhesion strength and a part of the holding force is taken over by the needle 21, which is driven twice through the foils 15 or the insert 25, resting on the ear lobe. These foil 15 or insert 25 moreover can be shaped like ornaments, wherein they project beyond the recess sidewise and take suitable forms there, looking decorative. The Jewellery piece itself can have an additional hole 36, in which the safety needle 21 is kept when not in use and can be supplied from there. When required, say, during a sports activity, higher forces act upon the ear Jewellery, the needle can be put on as safety whereas under nonnal circumstances, it is not required at all.<br>
This ear Jewellery and its system allow s a particularly comfortable and above all, pain free wearing of the Jewellery, specially of fashion Jewellery, which are, otherwise and conventionally, fastened on the ear lobe by means of a clamping mechanism. The system also allows for carrying on with pure ear Jewellery under additional safety by means of a needle, which is, however, not strained for normal wearing and, therefore, does not stress or stretch a hole on the ear lobe. The ear Jewellery can also comprise a holder or support, which works according to this system and on which then the actual Jewellery hangs. Of crucial importance for the correct functioning of the system is that the thickness of the ear lobe is determined in the state when it has been stretched by pulling it down and<br><br>
that the Jewellery with its corresponding measured width of the recess is made to touch on the ear lobe in this stretched condition. Then the ear lobe is let loose, by which it regains its shape with swelling and then it holds the ear Jewellery firmly as a result of adhesion force.<br>
The separate gauges 3 of the Gauge 2 can be deployed with standardised sizes, so that an internationally acceptable standard for their internal widths and their scale is created. This standard would permit that for known ear lobe thickness in stretched condition, that is for known internal widths of the gauge and of the ear Jewellery as well as for known position of the safety needle with the help of the readings on the scale, an ear Jewellery can be purchased without trial and it fits perfectly straightaway.<br><br>

I CLAIM :<br>
1.	Ear jewellery system with associated gauge (2) comprising of separate gauges<br>
(3) for optimal adaptation of the ear jewellery (1) on the ear lobe, characterized in that<br>
the ear jewellery has a U shaped recess (5), which, with its internal width (7) or with<br>
the internal width of an insert (25), to be put in the said recess, is intended for being<br>
pushed over the ear lobe (16) from below, the said ear lobe to be fitted, being<br>
stretched for the purpose of putting on, and thereby taking in precisely the thickness of<br>
the stretched ear lobe (16), wherein the suitable internal width (7) is determined by<br>
means of an appropriate gauge (2) for the system comprising of plurality of separate<br>
gauges (3) with respective mouths (8) of graded internal widths (12) and tongues (9)<br>
having thickness (13) of respective internal widths (7), so that with the help of a<br>
measurement of an ear lobe (16) to be fitted, in stretched condition, by means of these<br>
separate gauges (3), the suitable internal width (7) is ascertained of the U shaped<br>
recess (5) of the relevant ear jewellery (1) or of the insert (25) to be put in, from a<br>
series of ear jewellery or series of inserts with U shaped recess (5), having different<br>
internal widths.<br>
2.	Ear jewellery system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the separate gauges (3), belonging to the system and its gauge (2) have an integral scale (28) on their mouths (8) and on their tongues (9), for measuring the depth of putting on to an ear lobe (16) and determining the position of a possible hole (33) present in the ear lobe (16).<br>
3.	Ear jewellery system as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the inner walls (6) of the U shaped recesses (5) on the ear jewellery (1) are provided with one or several longish barbs, which are intended for digging in with the ear lobe or for taking in and supporting an insert (25).<br><br>
