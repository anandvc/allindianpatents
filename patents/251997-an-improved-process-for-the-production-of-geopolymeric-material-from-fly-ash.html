				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of geopolymeric material from fly ash. The invention particularly relates to an improved process for the production of geopolymeric material from fly ash, which is a waste material from thermal power plants. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved process for the production of geopolymeric material from mechanically activated fly ash<br>
The products produced by the process of present invention will use fly ash as the main component, which is abundantly available in India and worldwide. The process does not require large energy consumption and also no CO2 emission. The products produced by the process of present invention may be of very good volume stability, reasonable strength gain in short time, excellent durability and high fire resistance. The geopolymeric material of the present invention shall be useful as main ingredient of fire resistant and insulated panels, decorative stone artefacts, building materials, ceramic tiles, refractory items, aluminium foundry application, geopolymer cement and concrete for building and other applications, and immobilization of toxic wastes.<br>
The hitherto known processes to produce geopolymeric material use pure material such as alumina and silica as main raw material and sodium and potassium as alkaline activator. The existing possesses use alumina in the range of 10-50 % by weight and silica in the range of 50-90% by weight. The existing process to produce geopolymeric material consisted of crushing and grinding of raw material in a ball mill or vertical roller mill, proportioning and blending of raw materials in a mechanical mixer, mixing with alkaline activators such as silicates or hydroxides of potassium or sodium , shaping in desired shape and then curing at a temperature in the range of 60° - 250°C.<br>
Another known process to produce geopolymeric material use naturally occurring silica bearing minerals such as quartz and quartzite and aluminosilicate bearing minerals such as kaolinite and illite. The existing process to produce geopolymeric material consisted of crushing and grinding quartz or quartzite in a ball mill or vertical roller mill, calcining of kaolinite or illite etc in a gas fired or electrically heated furnace at a temperature in the range of 950° - 1050°C and then cooling to ambient temperature, proportioning and blending of raw materials in a mechanical mixer, mixing with alkaline activators such as silicates or hydroxides of potassium or<br>
sodium , shaping in desired shape and then curing at a temperature in the range of 60° - 250°C.<br>
Yet another known process to produce geopolymeric material uses fly ash, sand and granite aggregate as raw material. The process consisted of proportioning and blending of raw fly ash, clay and aggregate, mixing with sodium/ potassium based alkaline activators, casting in desired shape and then curing at a temperature in the range of 60° - 200°C.<br>
The existing processes (J. Davidovits, Geopolymer 2002 Conference, October 28-29, 2002, Melbourne, Australia ) to produce Geopolymeric material consisted of intermixing of fine powder of silica and alumina for 10 to 60 minutes in a mixer. Geopolymerization reactions are carried out in alkaline environment using sodium or potassium based activator and curing at a temperature in the range of 60° - 200°C.<br>
Another known process (D. Hardjito et al, Invited Paper, Concrete World: Engineering &amp;Materials, American Concrete Institute, India Chapter, Mumbai, India, December 9-12, 2004) uses mixing of fly ash, sand and granite aggregate in a mechanical mixer, addition of sodium based alkaline activator, vibration casting in the moulds. Curing the vibration casted material at elevated temperature produced the geopolymer material to be used as concrete.<br>
The hitherto known process have the following limitations:<br>
a.	The production cost of geopolymeric material is relatively high when it uses<br>
costly raw materials such as pure silica and alumina.<br>
b.	The formation of geopolymeric material is an energy intensive process when it<br>
uses naturally occurring raw material such as quartz, quartzite, kaolinite and<br>
illite. The     crushing and grinding of quartz or quartzite, and high temperature<br>
calcining of kaolinite and illite consumes high energy.<br>
b. The strength development of geopolymer is low when it uses fly ash as one of the raw material. Due to poor reactivity of fly ash, low compressive strength is obtained. Thus only a small proportion of fly ash is used in geopolymers.<br>
Traditionally, geopolymeric material has been produced by intermixing the fine powder of silica or silica bearing mineral and alumina or alumina, alumino-silicte bearing minerals with sodium and potassium based alkaline activator and followed by curing at elevated temperature. (J. Davidovits, Geopolymer 2002 Conference,<br>
October 28-29, 2002, Melbourne, Australia). The traditional method for making geopolymeric material using sodium, silica and alumina was patented by Davidovits in U.S. (U.S. Patent 4,509,985 , Davidovits et al, Early high-strength mineral polymer) Reference may be made to U.S. Patent 4472199, Davidovits et al, Synthetic mineral polymer compound of the silicoaluminate family and preparation process, wherein cast or moulded geopolymers produced by the existing processes for zeolite application. Reference may be made to D. Hardjito et al "Concrete World: Engineering &amp;Materials, American Concrete Institute, India Chapter, Mumbai, India, December 9-12, 2004" wherein uses of large volume of fly ash in geopolymer concrete have attracted intensive research attention. Fine grinding and mechanical activation of fly ash is suggested to improve its reactivity (A. Z. Juhasz, L. Opoczky, Mechanical activation of Minerals by Grinding: Pulverizing and Morphology of Particles, Ellis Norwood Limited, NY ,1994,). Various types of milling devices have been tried for the fine grinding and mechanical activation of fly ash. Reference may be made to Sanjay Kumar et al, 'Utilization of High Volume of Blast Furnace Slag and Fly Ash in Blended Cements through High Energy Milling', Proceedings of International Conference on Advance Concrete Structure, Chennei, Jan 2005, wherein the reactivity of fly ash was increased by mechanical activation in vibratory mill.<br>
According to literature and patent survey and available information, it may be mentioned that at present no process is available to produce geopolymeric material using mechanically activated fly ash. The purpose of this development is to use abundantly available waste materials such as 'fly ash', which is causing environmental pollution, to produce value added product such as geopolymeric material for various application.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main object of the present investigation is to provide an improved process for the production of geopolymeric material using mechanically activated fly ash, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process to .produce geopolymeric material whereby the energy consumption is significantly reduced.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process to produce geopolymeric material whereby the cost of production is appreciably lowered and the properties of the product is improved.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process to produce geopolymeric material whereby the reactivity of fly ash is increased by mechanical activation and the strength development of the product is improved.<br>
The fly ash used in the present invention contains silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3) and iron oxide (Fe2O3) and is partly crystalline and partly amorphous in nature.<br>
In the geopolymeric material produced by existing processes, fly ash does not actively participate in the geopolymerization reaction due to poor reactivity. The outer surface of the fly ash particles, which comes in contact with the alkaline activator, gets reacted but the inner core of the particles remains unreacted. As a result, the resulting geopolymeric materials have the inconsistent and poor strength development. Also only a limited quantity of fly ash is used in geopolymeric material due to its poor reactivity. In the process of the present invention, the fly ash is fine grounded and mechanically activated in high energy mill. The grinding media of high 'energy mill provides larger contact surface between the media and fly ash, higher agitator speed or vibration gives rise to greater kinetic energy of the media. The high energy milling process mechanically activates the fly ash and its reactivity is increased. When an alkaline activator such as sodium or potassium is added, the dissolution of fly ash particles starts. The increased reactivity of fly ash leads to enhanced dissolution activities. The mixture of mechanically activated fly ash and alkaline activator is shaped into desired shapes either by vibration casting or by uniaxial compression. For the geopolymerization reaction, the shaped articles are cured in the temperature range of 50-200°C. Due to enhanced curing temperature the dissolution reactions proceeds simultaneously with the gel formation and poly-condensation reactions, which results into setting of geopolymeric material and strength development. Also due to increased reactivity, higher percentage of fly ash is used in the geopolymeric material.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides An improved process for the production of geopolymeric material from fly ash, which comprises<br>
a)	activating mechanically fly ash by high energy milling, for a period of 10<br>
