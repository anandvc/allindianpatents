				<td>DEVICES FOR INJECTION OF GASEOUS STREAMS<br>
INTO A BED OF FLUIDIZED SOLIDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF DISCLOSURE<br>
Field of the Disclosure<br>
[0001]	Embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to an apparatus for the<br>
injection of a gaseous stream into a bed of fluidized solids. More specifically,<br>
embodiments disclosed herein relate to an injection nozzle.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	In the refining and chemical process industries, as well as in other processing<br>
industries, it is often necessary to inject a gaseous stream into a bed of finely divided<br>
solids, uniformly spreading the gas over the cross section of the bed and. The<br>
injection of the gas is designed to promote uniform and intimate contact of the<br>
gaseous medium with the bed of solids so as to achieve a purpose, such as a chemical<br>
reaction between the gas and solids and/or a mass transfer operation between the gas<br>
and solids.<br>
[0003]	Apparatus for injecting the gas into a fluidized bed typically consists of a flat<br>
grid plate with holes, a pipe grid system, or a series of concentric rings. These<br>
distributors are designed to physically cover as much of the bed cross section as<br>
possible so as to promote the even distribution of the gas across the entire bed. Gas is<br>
introduced into the space beneath the flat plate distributor or into the main header of a<br>
pipe grid and/or the ring distributor from a central source. From there the gas flows<br>
throughout the pipe grid or ring system and then discharges into the bed through a<br>
multiplicity of nozzles that distribute the gas uniformly into the bed. Plate grid<br>
distributors are typically not completely flat but are dished slightly up or down so as<br>
to better withstand the pressure exerted by the gas and/or the weight of the bed of<br>
solids above. Plate grid distributors may or may not contain nozzles, but typically<br>
only use a pattern of holes laid out in the plate to allow gas to flow through into the<br>
bed. Other embodiments of gas distributors for fluid beds of solids include dome type<br>
distributors and so-called "mushroom" distributors.<br>
[0004]	In order to achieve uniform distribution of the gas medium, the injection<br>
nozzles are typically designed with a cross sectional area that will cause a pressure<br>
drop to occur as the gas flows through the injection nozzles from the distribution<br>
 <br>
header into the bed of solids. The maintenance of a positive pressure drop across the<br>
injection nozzles insures that the gas flows evenly to all of the injection nozzles in<br>
spite of differences that can occur in the pressure in the bed at the point of discharge.<br>
Once the gas flows upward through the bed of solids, the bed becomes "fluidized"<br>
and begins to behave as a liquid. Such a fluidized bed of solids will exert a pressure<br>
proportional to the depth of the bed and the density of gas/solids mixture in the same<br>
manner as would a liquid of similar density and depth. Typically, such beds of<br>
fluidized solids will range in depth from a few feet to as much as 30 feet or more and<br>
will exhibit a measured density ranging from a few pounds per cubic foot to over 40<br>
pounds per cubic foot. The resulting pressure exerted by the column of fluidized<br>
solids will range from as little as 1 pound per square inch (psi) to as high as 10 psi or<br>
more. Moreover, the bed of solids is often quite turbulent, meaning the pressure at<br>
any one point in the bed fluctuates with time and will vary from point to point at a<br>
given depth in the bed. For this reason, it is important to design gas distributors with<br>
sufficient pressure drop so as to overcome the pressure fluctuations that are expected<br>
at the location of the gas distributor in the bed. A typical "rule of thumb" for the<br>
design of gas distributors is that the minimum pressure drop should be 15% of the bed<br>
pressure drop for downward pointed injection nozzles and 30% of the bed pressure<br>
drop for upward pointed distributors.<br>
[0005]	In addition to maintaining a minimum pressure drop for uniform distribution<br>
of the gas medium, injection nozzles are also designed to discharge the gas into the<br>
bed at relatively high velocity. If the gas velocity is too low, pressure pulsations can<br>
momentarily cause solids to be pressured backwards and flow from the bed into the<br>
injection nozzle. Such backflow of solids into an injection nozzle is undesirable as it<br>
can lead to erosion of the injection nozzle from the continued scouring action of the<br>
solids and/or plugging of an injection nozzle if the solids become lodged into a solid<br>
mass. Moreover, if the solids are pressured far enough into an injection nozzle, they<br>
can then enter the main header where they are picked up by the flowing gas to be<br>
discharged in one or more injection nozzles farther downstream. In such latter case,<br>
the result may be severe erosion in one or more injection nozzles downstream from<br>
the nozzle through which the solids entered the header. To prevent backflow of solids<br>
into the injection nozzles, the velocity in the nozzles is generally maintained above a<br>
certain minimum value, typically above about 20 feet per second (fps).<br>
 <br>
[0006]	A problem that continues to plague gas distributors in fluid beds is erosion of<br>
the injector nozzles at the point of discharge into the bed of solids. Over a long period<br>
of time, the impact of solid particles at the discharge edge of the injector will cause<br>
gradual wear at the injector tip. As the wear increases, the end of the nozzle can<br>
erode far enough back so as to destroy the point of attachment where the injector<br>
nozzle passes through the header. The result is a hole in the header and a loss of<br>
performance of the distributor. When this occurs, expensive and time consuming<br>
repairs are required to restore the performance of the grid or ring.<br>
[0007]	One widely used process in the petroleum refining industry that makes use of<br>
beds of finely divided solids is the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. The FCC<br>
process is used for the cracking of heavy boiling gas oil streams to produce more<br>
valuable, lighter boiling products, such as gasoline and lighter hydrocarbons. The<br>
FCC process uses solid catalysts in powder form to facilitate the breaking of the<br>
carbon-carbon atomic bonds of the gas oil feed to form smaller molecules that lie<br>
within the gasoline boiling range. In addition to the gasoline product, the process also<br>
produces substantial yields of lighter gases, such as propane and butane, which are<br>
recovered and converted to valuable products. Fluid catalytic cracking is the most<br>
widely used "conversion" process in petroleum refining and several million barrels<br>
per day of FCC capacity have been installed since the process inception in the early<br>
1940's. As such, the FCC process is of great economic value and is typically the most<br>
profitable unit in a petroleum refinery in the United States as well as in most<br>
refineries around the world.<br>
[0008]	The catalyst used in the FCC process is a finely divided solid composed of<br>
mostly silica and alumina in both crystalline and amorphous form. The use of a<br>
powdered catalyst has been the key feature contributing to the success of the FCC<br>
process and has lead to the development of an entire area of process operations that<br>
has come to be known as "fluidization." The finely divided powder catalyst can be<br>
made to behave as a fluid when it is properly aerated or "fluidized" by means of air or<br>
another gas. The fluidized powder can be made to flow in lines and will establish a<br>
level within a vessel, as would a liquid. A fluidized power will also generate a<br>
hydraulic pressure head proportional to the density and the depth of the mixture<br>
within a vessel or in a vertical standpipe as would a fluid. The powder can also be<br>
pneumatically transported by a gas stream when the gas has sufficient velocity. The<br>
 <br>
ability to flow the powdered catalyst between vessels has been of tremendous benefit<br>
in the development of a viable catalytic cracking process. Earlier attempts to use a<br>
fixed bed of catalyst pellets were largely handicapped by the need to regenerate the<br>
catalyst frequently to remove deposits of "coke" that are a by-product of cracking.<br>
The coke, mostly carbon with some hydrogen and sulfur, deactivates the catalyst and<br>
must be removed by means of a combustion step. By use of a "fluidizable" catalyst,<br>
the catalyst can be continuously circulated between the reaction and regeneration<br>
vessels of a FCC unit so that there is no need for a cyclical process in order to<br>
accomplish the reaction and regeneration steps.<br>
[0009]	In the FCC process large volumes of air are used in the Regenerator vessel to<br>
remove coke from the catalyst and restore catalyst activity. The air is typically<br>
injected into a bed of coked catalyst by means of pipe grid or ring type distributors.<br>
The FCC process also makes use of large pipe or ring type distributors in the stripping<br>
section where the spent catalyst is contacted with steam to remove entrained<br>
hydrocarbons before the catalyst is sent to the regenerator. Smaller pipe or ring<br>
distributors are used elsewhere in the FCC process to inject either steam or air to keep<br>
the powdered catalyst in a "fluidized" or aerated state. Injection nozzles used in each<br>
of these areas of the FCC process may be subject to erosion, as described above.<br>
[0010]	A number of attempts have been made to improve injection nozzle design to<br>
reduce the harmful effects of erosion and extend the useful life of the distributor.<br>
These include the use of exotic alloys and ceramic materials to make the injection<br>
nozzle itself harder and more resistant to erosion, protecting the discharge end of the<br>
injection nozzle with hard surfacing such as metal overlays or refractory layers,<br>
and/or changes in the design of the nozzle.<br>
[0011]	A current state-of-the-art air distributor design for an FCC regenerator makes<br>
use of a pipe grid distributor and a two-stage injection nozzle design. Such a design is<br>
shown in Figure 1 A, which is a plan view of a pipe grid distributor consisting of three<br>
identical grids in a triangular arrangement to cover the circular cross-section of an<br>
FCC Regenerator. Figure 1B is an elevation view of one of the pipe grids showing<br>
how the main air supply trunk enters from the bottom, with three branches that also<br>
support the grid. All of the grids are installed at the same elevation in the bed of<br>
powdered catalyst so as to have, as nearly as possible, a uniform pressure into which<br>
the air is discharged. Figure 1C is a cross section of one of the grid arms showing the<br>
 <br>
arrangement of the downward-directed nozzles at 45 degrees from vertical. This pipe<br>
grid design has proven very efficient at physically distributing the air over the cross<br>
section of the catalyst bed so that the coke burning is uniform.<br>
[0012]	Figure 1D is a cross section of one of the air injection nozzles that utilizes a<br>
two-stage or so-called "Borda" tube. Figures 1E-1H contain various views showing<br>
the nozzle arrangement inside one of the grid arms. The metal grid arms are covered<br>
in erosion resistant refractory to protect both the grid arms themselves and the final<br>
length of the injection nozzles from erosion by the wearing action of the catalyst<br>
particles.<br>
[0013]	The Borda tube or two-stage nozzle consists of a straight tube with a<br>
concentric orifice at the inlet end. In the Borda tube design, the orifice is sized so as<br>
to provide sufficient pressure drop to promote uniform distribution of air across the<br>
grid, where the pressure drop is typically between about 1 and 3 psi. The orifice is<br>
followed by a larger diameter tubular section that slows down the gas so that the<br>
discharge velocity into the bed of solids does not cause excessive erosion and/or<br>
attrition of the catalyst. See, for example, Joseph W. Wilson, "Fluid Catalytic<br>
Cracking," p. 140-141, Penwell Publishing, 1997, describing use of a Borda tube as<br>
an injection nozzle in FCC applications.<br>
[0014]	The recommended length for the Borda tube is a minimum of six times the<br>
tube diameter to allow the flow in the tube to become fully developed following the<br>
nozzle orifice. It has been established in practice that, if the nozzle is too short, the<br>
flow at the discharge will be turbulent and excessive erosion will result at the nozzle<br>
tip.<br>
[0015]	Although the Borda tube design and the use of hard materials for construction<br>
of the nozzle and/or protection of the nozzle tip have greatly improved the life of the<br>
grid distributors in FCC service, these designs are still subject to erosive wear that<br>
requires periodic replacement of either individual nozzles in a grid arm or<br>
replacement of the entire grid arm. These types of repairs are difficult to make and<br>
can lengthen the time required to perform routine maintenance during scheduled<br>
down periods.<br>
[0016]	Another example of an air distributor used for FCC catalyst regeneration<br>
process is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,223,843. As disclosed therein, the air<br>
distributor includes a plurality of nozzles in a header ring and in a cylindrical housing,<br>
 <br>
with each nozzle formed with a diverging bore for ejecting high pressure air. The<br>
diverging bore of each of the nozzles is formed at a half angle of less than 7° for<br>
providing a maximum air velocity without destruction of the spent catalyst.<br>
[0017]	U.S. Patent No. 4,460,130 discloses an injector nozzle disposed external to the<br>
manifold having a central opening and an inlet extending from the nozzle to the<br>
central passage. The cross-sectional area of the central opening in the nozzle in the<br>
direction of flow is smaller at least at one point than that of the inlet such that a major<br>
portion of the pressure drop in the gas flowing from the central passage through the<br>
inlet and the nozzle is created by the nozzle. The central opening outwardly diverges<br>
at an angle of less than 15° to avoid jetting and formation of eddy currents.<br>
[0018]	There still exists a need in the art for gas distribution devices that are subject<br>
to less erosive wear.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0045]	In one aspect, embodiments herein relate to an apparatus for the injection of a<br>
gaseous stream into a bed of fluidized solids. More specifically, embodiments<br>
disclosed herein relate to an injection nozzle that may result in a gas velocity profile<br>
so as to reduce or avoid erosion of the injection nozzle.<br>
[0046]	Injection nozzles may have a fluid inlet, in fluid communication with a gas<br>
distribution manifold, and a fluid outlet, in fluid communication with a vessel, for<br>
example. The fluid inlet of injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed<br>
herein may include one or more fluid pathways parallel, perpendicular, or transverse<br>
to the nozzle axis. The fluid pathways may be designed and distributed on the nozzle<br>
so as to result in one or more of: a desired pressure drop across the nozzle; a stable<br>
gas velocity profile; a uniform velocity profile that may be centered with the nozzle<br>
 <br>
outlet; and a maximum velocity less than that which may cause attrition of solid<br>
particles being fluidized.<br>
[0047]	Examples of injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein are<br>
illustrated in Figures 2-9. Although features of the injection nozzles are illustrated in<br>
the Figures as generally circular / cylindrical, other shapes / profiles may be used,<br>
such as square, rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, etc. As such, when referring to<br>
diameter herein, it is understood that the diameter is an equivalent diameter for shapes<br>
other than circular.<br>
[0048]	Referring now to Figures 2A (cross-sectional view) and 2B (inlet end view),<br>
an injection nozzle according to embodiments disclosed herein is illustrated. Injection<br>
nozzle 10 may include tube 12 having a fluid inlet end 14 and a fluid outlet 16. Fluid<br>
inlet 14 may be formed, for example, from a plurality of radial flow restriction<br>
orifices 17 distributed circumferentially through tube 12. As used herein, "plurality"<br>
refers to two or more, even if illustrated as having a different number. As shown in<br>
Figure 2B, the inlet end may be capped with a back plate 18, having no flow<br>
openings, so as to only allow flow of gas radially into tube 12 via radial flow<br>
restriction orifices 17.<br>
[0049]	The number and diameter of the radial flow restriction orifices may depend<br>
upon the desired pressure drop through tube 10. The plurality of radial flow<br>
restriction orifices 17 may be distributed through the tube 12 in a circumferentially<br>
row. Other embodiments may include additional circumferential rows of radial tlow<br>
restriction orifices.<br>
[0050]	A ratio of an inner diameter DT of the tube outlet to a diameter Do of a radial<br>
flow restriction orifice may be greater than 2:1. In other embodiments, the ratio of an<br>
inner diameter DT of the tube outlet to a diameter Do of a radial flow restriction<br>
orifice may be within the range from 2:1 to 20:1.<br>
[0051]	The plurality of radial flow restriction orifices may be disposed through the<br>
tube a length L from an inlet axial end of the tube proximate the inlet. In some<br>
embodiments, the length L may be less than 2 times the inner diameter of fluid outlet<br>
14; less than 1.5 times the inner diameter of fluid outlet 14 in other embodiments, less<br>
than 1 times the inner diameter of fluid outlet 14 in other embodiments; and less than<br>
0.5 times the inner diameter of fluid outlet 14 in yet other embodiments. In other<br>
 <br>
embodiments, the radial flow restriction orifices may be positioned as close to the<br>
axial end as possible so as to provide both manufacturability and structural integrity.<br>
[0052]	Referring now to Figures 3A (profile view) and 3B (inlet end view), an<br>
injection nozzle according to embodiments disclosed herein is illustrated. Injection<br>
nozzle 20 may include tube 22 having a fluid inlet 24 and a fluid outlet 26. Fluid inlet<br>
24 may be formed, for example, from a plurality of axial flow restriction orifices 27<br>
distributed axially through inlet plate 28.<br>
[0053]	As shown in Figure 3B, the axial flow orifices 26 may be distributed over inlet<br>
plate 28 using an even spacing. Use of an even spacing may allow for ease of<br>
manufacture, structural integrity. More importantly, evenly spaced axial flow<br>
restriction orifices may allow for development of a uniform, centered flow profile.<br>
[0054]	Comparing Figure 3A and Figure 4A, where like numerals represent like parts,<br>
axial flow restriction orifices 26 may have a length L0 that may be tailored to achieve<br>
a desired pressure drop or velocity profile. In some embodiments, length L0 may<br>
allow for flow within the axial flow restriction orifice 27 to stabilize, thus exiting the<br>
orifice at a more uniform velocity profile, correspondingly resulting in a more<br>
uniform velocity profile at fluid outlet 26. For example, length L0 may be at least 4<br>
times the diameter of an axial flow restriction orifice in some embodiments; at least 5<br>
times the diameter of an axial flow restriction orifice in yet other embodiments.<br>
[0055]	The length from an orifice outlet end 32 to fluid outlet 24 should also be<br>
sufficient to develop a stable, uniform velocity profile. In some embodiments, a ratio<br>
of an axial length of the tube to an axial length of the plurality of flow restriction<br>
orifices may be at least 4:1; within the range from 5:1 to 50:1 in other embodiments.<br>
[0056]	The number and diameter of the axial flow restriction orifices may also<br>
depend upon the desired pressure drop through tube 20. In some embodiments, a ratio<br>
of an inner diameter of the tube outlet to a diameter of an axial flow restriction orifice<br>
is greater than 2:1; within the range from 2:1 to 20:1 in other embodiments.<br>
[0057]	As illustrated in Figures 5A (profile view) and 5B (inlet end view), where like<br>
numerals represent like parts, axial flow restriction orifices 26 may be tapered. For<br>
example, axial flow orifices 26 may increase in diameter from an orifice inlet end 30<br>
to an orifice outlet end 32, where the outer diameter may taper at an angle a up to<br>
 <br>
about 15° in some embodiments; at an angle a between about 5° and 15° in other<br>
embodiments; and at an angle a between 7.5° and 12.5° in yet other embodiments.<br>
[0058]	Referring now to Figures 6A (profile view) and 6B (inlet end view), an<br>
injection nozzle according to embodiments disclosed herein is illustrated. Injection<br>
nozzle 60 may include tube 62 having a fluid inlet 64 and a fluid outlet 66. Fluid inlet<br>
64 may be formed, for example, as an annular orifice 68 surrounding a flow<br>
restriction device 70. As illustrated in Figure 6A, flow restriction device 70 may<br>
include a disk 70D, appropriately suspended in the center of the inlet end of tube 62.<br>
[0059]	The width W of annular orifice 68 may depend upon the desired pressure drop<br>
through nozzle 60, among other factors. In some embodiments, a diameter of disk<br>
70D may range from 0.5 to 0.95 times the inner diameter of tube 62; from 0.6 to 0.85<br>
times the inner diameter of tube 62 in other embodiments.<br>
[0060]	Comparing Figure 6A and Figure 7A, where like numerals represent like parts,<br>
flow restriction device 70 may have a length LA that may be tailored to achieve a<br>
desired pressure drop or velocity profile. In some embodiments, length LA may allow<br>
for flow within the annular orifice 68 to stabilize, thus exiting the orifice at a more<br>
uniform velocity profile, correspondingly resulting in a more uniform velocity profile<br>
at fluid outlet 66. For example, length LA may be at least 4 times width W; at least 5<br>
times width W in yet other embodiments.<br>
[0061]	The length from an annular orifice outlet end 72 to fluid outlet 66 should also<br>
be sufficient to develop a stable, uniform velocity profile. In some embodiments, a<br>
ratio of an axial length LT of the tube to a length LA of the annular flow orifice may be<br>
at least 4:1; within the range from 5:1 to 50:1 in other embodiments.<br>
[0062]	As illustrated in Figures 8A (profile view), 8B (inlet end view), 9A (profile<br>
view), and 9B (inlet end view), where like numerals represent like parts, annular flow<br>
orifice 66 may be tapered, such as through use of a flow restriction device 70C that<br>
may be conical. For example, annular flow orifice 68 may increase in diameter from<br>
an orifice inlet end 72 to an orifice outlet end 74, where the outer diameter may taper<br>
at an angle β up to about 15° in some embodiments; at an angle β between about 5°<br>
and 15° in other embodiments; and at an angle β between 7.5° and 12.5° in yet other<br>
embodiments. As illustrated in Figure 9A, the outlet end of conical flow restriction<br>
device 70C may be truncated (resulting in a frustoconical flow restriction device 70F).<br>
 <br>
[0063]	Injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein, as described<br>
above, may provide for a stable velocity profile. Such injection nozzles may provide<br>
for a uniform velocity profile centered at the nozzle outlet. Injection nozzles<br>
according to embodiments disclosed herein may avoid generation of areas having a<br>
high velocity or localized jets that may cause particle attrition. Additionally, injection<br>
nozzles disclosed herein may avoid generation of areas having a negative axial<br>
velocity proximate the nozzle outlet, thus resulting in a low nozzle erosion rate.<br>
[0064]	Injection nozzles described above may be disposed in a gas distribution<br>
apparatus. Injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein may be used<br>
with all types of distribution apparatus where only a gaseous phase is being<br>
distributed into a bed of fluidized solids. For example, distributors may include a flat<br>
plate distributor, a pipe grid system, a ring distributor, a dome-type distributor, and a<br>
mushroom distributor, among others. Such distributors may be disposed in vessels for<br>
performing various reactions or mass transfer between the gas and solids, including<br>
FCC catalyst regeneration vessels, gas-phase polymerization vessels, coal<br>
gasification, and iron ore reduction, among others.<br>
[0065]	Referring now to Figures 10 and 11, where like numerals represent like parts,<br>
injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein, disposed in a gas<br>
distribution apparatus, are illustrated. Gas distribution apparatus 80 may include a<br>
ring type distributor (not illustrated) having a gas distribution manifold 82 in fluid<br>
communication with a gas source and a plurality of injection nozzles 84. Each of the<br>
injection nozzles may include a fluid inlet 86 disposed within the distribution<br>
manifold and a fluid outlet 88. In some embodiments, such as shown in Figure 10,<br>
the fluid outlet 88 may be located proximate an outer circumference 89 of gas<br>
distribution manifold 82, In other embodiments, such as shown in Figure 11, the fluid<br>
outlet 88 may terminate at a point external to gas distribution manifold 82.<br>
[0066]	Similarly, referring now to Figures 12 and 13, where like numerals represent<br>
like parts, injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein, disposed in a<br>
gas distribution apparatus, are illustrated. Gas distribution apparatus 90 may include a<br>
flat plate distributor 91 within a vessel 92, having a gas distribution manifold 93 in<br>
fluid communication with a gas source 94 and a plurality of injection nozzles 95.<br>
Each of the injection nozzles may include a fluid inlet 96 disposed within the<br>
distribution manifold and a fluid outlet 97. In some embodiments, such as shown in<br>
 <br>
Figure 12, the fluid outlet 97 may be located proximate a top surface 98 of flat plat<br>
99. In other embodiments, such as shown in Figure 13, the fluid outlets 97 may<br>
terminate at a point above top surface 98 of flat plate 99.<br>
[0067]	As mentioned above, injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed<br>
herein may be used in gas distribution apparatus used for FCC catalyst regeneration,<br>
for example. Injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein may<br>
additionally be used in other portions of a cracking process as well, such as illustrated<br>
in and described with respect to Figure 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,314,610, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. As described in the '610 patent, gas distribution<br>
apparatus may be used for injection of a stripping medium, such as steam or nitrogen,<br>
into a catalytic cracking reaction vessel, or for injection of oxygen or air for<br>
combustion and removal of coke from a spent catalyst.<br>
[0068]	Examples<br>
[0069]	The following examples are derived from modeling techniques and although<br>
the work was actually achieved, the inventors do not present these examples in the<br>
past tense to comply with applicable rules.<br>
[0070]	Simulations of injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein<br>
are compared to Borda tubes and modified Borda tubes using "computational fluid<br>
dynamics" (CFD). CFD is used to examine and compare the flow patterns resulting<br>
from a given injection nozzle configuration, as illustrated in Figures 14-17. As will<br>
be shown, injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein may reduce<br>
the potential for flow instabilities and potential for erosive wear at the nozzle tip. The<br>
CFD studies are conducted using identical conditions for each injection nozzle<br>
configuration simulated such that the air flows and pressure drops were the same for<br>
each design.<br>
[0071]	Comparative Example 1<br>
[0072]	Referring to Figures 14A - 14E, CFD results for a standard Borda type<br>
injection nozzle that is widely used for gas distributors in fluidized beds is illustrated.<br>
The nozzle is 9 inches in length, has an inner diameter at the outlet of 1.5 inches, and<br>
the inlet orifice is 1.04 inches in diameter. Figure 14A is a cross-section of a gas<br>
distribution header, showing the flow velocity vectors inside the header, the Borda<br>
tube, and the surrounding bed of solids. As would be expected, there is a high<br>
 <br>
velocity jet as the gas accelerates through the orifice and diverges into the larger<br>
diameter of the Borda tube downstream of orifice.<br>
[0073]	Figure 14B shows the velocity vectors on a single plane that cuts through a<br>
cross section of the header and Borda tube and out into a bed of solids. The plane is<br>
oriented so as to be parallel to the direction of the general gas flow in the header. The<br>
CFD results indicate that the gas jet exiting the orifice is influenced by the gas flow in<br>
the header. Moreover, the animated CFD shows that the gas jet is not stable, but<br>
sways from side-to-side inside the Borda tube.<br>
[0074]	Figures 14C and 14D are close up snapshots of the gas jet from the orifice<br>
viewed from two different directions, one view being in the direction of the gas flow<br>
in the header and the second view being perpendicular to the direction of the gas flow.<br>
It is clear from these views that the jet from the orifice is being influenced by the flow<br>
of gas in the header.<br>
[0075]	Figure 14E is a view along a single plane through the center of the Borda tube<br>
with the orientation of the plane being parallel to the direction of gas flow in the<br>
header. It is surprising to find that the instability of the gas jet persists beyond the end<br>
of the nozzle and into the bed of fluidized solids despite the nozzle having the<br>
minimum recommended length to diameter ratio (L/D) of 6.0. Moreover, the<br>
instability of the gas jet actually results in a negative axial velocity in one part of the<br>
tube. The animated version of the CFD study shows that the negative velocity region<br>
is not stable, but moves from side to side in the tube, as illustrated in Figure 15A, an<br>
end view of the nozzle inlet, and Figures 15B-15K, which contain sequential (equal<br>
time interval) snapshots from the CFD analysis of a Borda tube injection nozzle<br>
showing how the jet moves from side to side in the Borda tube. It is clear from these<br>
results that this nozzle design may allow solids to backflow into the region of negative<br>
axial velocity only to be picked up and ejected at high velocity when the gas jet<br>
reverses sides in the tube. The behavior of the unstable gas jet coincides with<br>
observed wear pattern on these types of nozzles after use for a period of time.<br>
[0076]	Comparative Examples 2-5<br>
[0077]	Referring now to Figures 16-20 (Comparative Examples 1-5), snapshot views<br>
along an axial plane through various injection modified Borda tube configurations are<br>
illustrated. All of the injection nozzles are evaluated under the same conditions of<br>
inlet pressure with the orifice openings sized to provide a constant pressure drop of<br>
 <br>
2.1 psi across the injector. Each nozzle is 9 inches in length and has a 1.5 inch inner<br>
diameter (L/D of 6).<br>
[0078]	Comparative Example 1 (repeat) - Figure 16 is the standard Borda tube with a<br>
single orifice, as previously shown in Figures 14 and 15, shown again here for<br>
reference.<br>
[0079]	Comparative Example 2 - In Figure 17, the Borda tube includes a double<br>
orifice (each 1/4-inch in length and having a diameter of 1.04 inches) with a 0.75-inch<br>
space between the orifices. The CFD results indicate no improvement in the stability<br>
of the jet or the presence of regions of negative axial velocity in the nozzle tube as<br>
compared to a standard Borda tube.<br>
[0080]	Comparative Example 3 - In Figure 18, the orifice includes a short sloped<br>
section on the downstream end. Again, the CFD results indicate no improvement in<br>
the stability of the jet or the presence of regions of negative axial velocity in the<br>
nozzle tube.<br>
[0081]	Comparative Example 4 - In Figures 19A (profile view) and 19B (end view of<br>
nozzle inlet), the thickness of the orifice is increased from 1/4-inch to 1-inch in length.<br>
This arrangement demonstrates less instability in the CFD results. However, the<br>
region of negative axial velocity is still present although the location of the negative<br>
velocity region is more stable.<br>
[0082]	Comparative Example 5 - In Figures 20A (profile view) and 20B (end view of<br>
nozzle inlet, the thick nozzle includes a long sloped region at the outlet end of the<br>
orifice. This arrangement demonstrates a very stable velocity profile. However, the<br>
gas jet is not centered in the tube and there is a relatively large, though stable, area of<br>
negative axial velocity.<br>
[0083]	The CFD analyses of a Borda tube and modified Borda tubes in Figures 16-20<br>
exhibit unstable flow and / or negative axial velocity, each of which is an undesired<br>
flow characteristic of a gas injection nozzle.<br>
[0084]	Examples 1-5<br>
[0085]	Referring now to Figures 21-25 (Examples 1-5), snapshot views along an axial<br>
plane through injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed herein are<br>
illustrated. All of the injection nozzles are evaluated under the same conditions as<br>
Comparative Examples 1-5 (same inlet pressure with the orifice openings sized to<br>
 <br>
provide a constant pressure drop of 2.1 psi across the injector). Each nozzle is 9<br>
inches in length and has a 1.5 inch inner diameter (L/D of 6).<br>
[0086]	Example 1 - Figures 21A (profile view) and 21B (end view of nozzle inlet)<br>
illustrate a CFD analysis of an orifice similar to that illustrated in the embodiments<br>
described with relation to Figures 6A and 6B. The orifice configuration includes an<br>
annular opening surrounding a flat disk (0.75 inches in diameter and l/4-inch in length<br>
suspended in the center at the inlet of the injection nozzle. This nozzle has a very<br>
stable velocity profile. However, the velocity profile is not centered at the outlet.<br>
Additionally, there may be localized regions where backflow might occur and the<br>
nozzle may be difficult to manufacture.<br>
[0087]	Example 2 - Figures 22A (profile view) and 22B (end view of nozzle inlet)<br>
illustrate a CFD analysis of an orifice similar to that illustrated in the embodiment<br>
described with relation to Figures 9A and 9B. The orifice configuration includes a<br>
tapered cone suspended at the inlet of the nozzle to form the annular orifice opening.<br>
This nozzle performs as well as that of Figures 21A and 21B from a stability<br>
standpoint, but shows improvement in that the velocity profile is almost perfectly<br>
centered in the nozzle tube. However, the nozzle may be difficult to manufacture.<br>
[0088]	Example 3 - Figures 23A (profile view) and 23B (end view of nozzle inlet)<br>
illustrate a CFD analysis of an orifice similar to that illustrated in the embodiment<br>
described with relation to Figures 3A and 3B. The orifice configuration includes<br>
seven (7) smaller orifices to provide the same pressure drop as the single orifice<br>
arrangement. This arrangement exhibits a fairly stable velocity profile, and, the<br>
velocity profile at the nozzle exit is very uniform. There are some areas of negative<br>
axial velocity, but these are confined to the inlet half of the nozzle and do not reach<br>
the nozzle tip.<br>
[0089]	Example 4 - Figures 24A (profile view) and 24B (end view of nozzle inlet)<br>
illustrate a CFD analysis of an orifice similar to that illustrated in the embodiment<br>
described with relation to Figures 4A and 4B. The orifice configuration includes a<br>
multi-orifice (7 hole) arrangement similar to Example 3, except that the thin orifice<br>
plate (1/4-inch) has been replaced with a thick (1-inch) plate. The inclusion of the<br>
thick orifice plate improves the stability of the velocity profile compared to Example<br>
3, while also showing a very uniform velocity profile at the injection nozzle outlet.<br>
 <br>
Moreover, the point at which the velocity profile becomes uniform occurs sooner than<br>
with the thin orifice arrangement of Example 3.<br>
[0090]	Example 5 - Figures 25A (profile view) and 25B (end view of nozzle inlet)<br>
illustrate a CFD analysis of an orifice similar to that illustrated in the embodiment<br>
described with relation to Figures 2A and 2B. The orifice configuration includes a<br>
multi-orifice arrangement with eight (8) holes that have been moved to the side of the<br>
tube rather than being placed on the back plate. There are no openings on the back<br>
plate. Again, the orifice area is sized to provide the same overall nozzle pressure drop<br>
of 2.1 psi as maintained for all previous arrangements. The CFD studies show that<br>
this arrangement results in a stable, uniform velocity profile. In the animated CFD<br>
result, there is almost no movement detected in the velocity profile. Moreover, the<br>
nozzle design is easy to manufacture relative to the standard Borda tube of<br>
Comparative Example 1.<br>
[0091]	Example 6 - Figures 26-31 compare CFD analyses of orifice similar to that<br>
illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B with a CFD analysis of the standard Borda tube of<br>
Comparative Example 1 (illustrated in Figure 16 and repeated as Figures 27, 29, and<br>
31 for convenience, where 27A, 29A, and 31A represent a profile view, and 27B,<br>
29B, and 31B represent an end view of the nozzle inlet). The orifice configurations<br>
include multi-orifice arrangements with eight (8) holes (Figures 26A (end view) and<br>
26B (profile view of nozzle inlet), six (6) holes (Figures 28A (end view) and 28B<br>
(profile view of nozzle inlet), and four (4) holes (Figures 30A (end view) and 30B<br>
(profile view of nozzle inlet) that have been moved to the side of the tube rather than<br>
being placed on the back plate. There are no openings on the back plate. Again, the<br>
orifice area is sized to provide the same overall nozzle pressure drop of 2.1 psi as<br>
maintained for all previous arrangements. The CFD studies show that these<br>
arrangements result in stable, uniform velocity profiles (reduced oscillation over time)<br>
compared to the standard Borda Tube. The CFD studies also show that moving from<br>
eight (8) to six (6) to four (4) openings improved uniformity in the outlet velocity.<br>
[0092]	As described above, injection nozzles according to embodiments disclosed<br>
herein may advantageously provide for one or more of a stable velocity profile, a<br>
uniform velocity at the injection nozzle outlet, and limited regions having a negative<br>
flow velocity. Advantageously, such injection nozzles may result in one or more of<br>
decreased erosion, decreased catalyst attrition, and improved gas distribution.<br>
