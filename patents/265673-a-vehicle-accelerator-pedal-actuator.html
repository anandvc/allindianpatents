PNEUMATIC ACCELERATOR PEDAL ACTUATOR<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/919,954, filed on March 23, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to actuation mechanisms, and<br>
more specifically to actuation mechanisms for vehicle validation.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Electronic throttle control (ETC) systems may replace the<br>
mechanical pedal assemblies that have been used in vehicles. ETC systems<br>
enhance overall engine management while reducing the cost of the vehicle.<br>
Traditional engine controls rely on direct input from drivers and numerous<br>
valves and linkages to manage the engine.<br>
[0005] ETC sensors and remote throttle actuators may eliminate the<br>
linkage that is used to connect the accelerator pedal to the throttle body. ETC<br>
sensors take input from the driver's foot through a determined accelerator<br>
pedal position and send it to an engine control system in real time. The<br>
engine control system modulates the air/fuel flow to the engine. Direct control<br>
of the engine is shifted from the driver to the engine control system to improve<br>
efficiency.<br>
[0006] Due to the elimination of the traditional linkages in ETC<br>
systems, throttle position is evaluated based on accelerator pedal position<br>
during vehicle validation. Accuracy and repeatability of accelerator position<br>
provides for proper evaluation of ETC system accuracy.<br><br>
2<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, a vehicle accelerator pedal actuator may<br>
include a pressurized fluid source, a mounting mechanism configured to fix<br>
the accelerator pedal actuator relative to a vehicle accelerator pedal, and an<br>
actuating mechanism in fluid communication with the pressurized fluid source<br>
and configured to displace the vehicle accelerator pedal. The vehicle<br>
accelerator pedal actuator may further include a valve providing selective<br>
communication between the pressurized fluid source and the actuating<br>
mechanism.<br>
[0008] A method of actuating a vehicle accelerator pedal may<br>
include locating a vehicle accelerator pedal actuator proximate the vehicle<br>
accelerator pedal, securing the vehicle accelerator pedal actuator relative to<br>
the vehicle accelerator pedal, and providing a source of pressurized fluid to<br>
the vehicle accelerator pedal actuator to displace the vehicle accelerator<br>
pedal.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software<br>
or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. Vehicle 10 may include an engine 12 in<br>
communication with an intake system 14, a fuel system 16, and an ignition<br>
system 18. Intake system 14 may include an intake manifold 22 and a throttle<br>
24. Throttle 24 may control an air flow into engine 12. Fuel system 16 may<br>
control a fuel flow into engine 12 and ignition system 18 may ignite the air/fuel<br>
mixture provided to engine 12 by intake system 14 and fuel system 16.<br>
[0017] Vehicle 10 may further include an accelerator pedal 26, a<br>
brake pedal 28, a control module 30, and an electronic throttle control (ETC)<br>
32. Accelerator pedal 26 may be in communication with an accelerator pedal<br>
sensor 34. Accelerator pedal sensor 34 may be in communication with<br>
control module 30 and provide a signal indicative of accelerator pedal<br>
position.<br>
[0018] Control module 30 may be in communication with ETC 32<br>
and provide a signal indicative of the position of accelerator pedal 26 ETC 32<br>
may be in communication with throttle 24 and may control operation thereof<br>
based on the accelerator pedal position. During validation of vehicle 10, an<br>
accelerator  pedal   actuator  38  may  be  fixed  to  vehicle   10   relative  to<br><br>
4<br>
accelerator pedal 26. More specifically, accelerator pedal actuator 38 may be<br>
fixed to brake pedal 28, as discussed below.<br>
[0019] With additional reference to Figures 2 and 3, accelerator<br>
pedal actuator 38 may include a main body structure 40 having first and<br>
second chambers 42, 44 formed therein. First chamber 42 may include first<br>
and second stops 43, 45 therein. Second chamber 44 may include a stop 47<br>
therein as well. A first fluid passage 46 may extend within main body<br>
structure 40. Second, third, fourth, and fifth fluid passages 48, 49, 50, 51 may<br>
branch off from first fluid passage 46. Second fluid passage 48 may be in<br>
fluid communication with first chamber 42 and third fluid passage 49 may be<br>
in fluid communication with second chamber 44. Second and third fluid<br>
passages 48, 49 may provide fluid communication between first fluid passage<br>
46 and first and second chambers 42, 44.<br>
[0020] A first valve member 52 may be disposed in second fluid<br>
passage 48 and a second valve member 54 may be disposed in third fluid<br>
passage 49. Fourth and fifth fluid passages 50, 51 may be in communication<br>
with first and second valve members 52, 54 and the atmosphere. First and<br>
second valve members 52, 54 may selectively allow or block fluid<br>
communication between first fluid passage 46 and first and second chambers<br>
42, 44. First and second valve members 52, 54 may also selectively provide<br>
fluid communication between fourth and fifth fluid passages 50, 51 and first<br>
and second chambers 42, 44.<br>
[0021] First and second valve members 52, 54 may be activated<br>
independently from one another. First and second valve members 52, 54<br>
may be manually actuated or may be actuated automatically, such as through<br>
the use of a solenoid valve. First and second chambers 42, 44 may be<br>
vented to atmosphere when fourth and fifth fluid passages 50, 51 are placed<br>
in communication with second and third fluid passages 48, 49, respectively.<br><br>
5<br>
[0022] First and second actuating members 56, 58 may be slidably<br>
disposed within first and second chambers 42, 44 and may be normally<br>
biased into disengaged positions (as seen in Figure 2) by springs 57, 59.<br>
More specifically, spring 57 may generally bias first actuating member 56<br>
against first stop 43. Spring 59 may generally bias second actuating member<br>
58 against stop 47. First actuating member 56 may form an accelerator pedal<br>
actuating mechanism and second actuating member 58 may form a mounting<br>
mechanism for accelerator pedal actuator 38. With reference to Figure 3, first<br>
actuating member 56 may displace accelerator pedal 26 a predetermined<br>
distance, as discussed below. Second actuating member 58 may clamp<br>
brake pedal 28 to main body structure 40, as discussed below.<br>
[0023] A fluid supply 60 may be in communication with first passage<br>
46. Fluid supply 60 may provide a pressurized fluid to first fluid passage 46.<br>
More specifically, fluid supply 60 may include a pressurized air supply.<br>
Pressurized air from fluid supply 60 may be used to displace first actuating<br>
member 56 for displacement of accelerator pedal 26. Pressurized air from<br>
fluid supply 60 may also be used to displace second actuating member 58 for<br>
mounting accelerator pedal actuator 38 to brake pedal 28.<br>
[0024] With additional reference to Figure 4, flow chart 100<br>
generally shows operation of accelerator pedal actuator 38. As indicated at<br>
step 102, accelerator pedal actuator 38 may be located proximate to<br>
accelerator pedal 26. More specifically, locating accelerator pedal actuator 38<br>
may include positioning accelerator pedal actuator 38 such that first actuating<br>
member 56 is located above accelerator pedal 26 and may include first<br>
actuating member 56 being in a spaced relation to accelerator pedal 26. As<br>
indicated at step 104, accelerator pedal actuator 38 may then be secured in<br>
position.<br><br>
6<br>
[0025] Securing accelerator pedal actuator 38 may include fixing<br>
accelerator pedal actuator 38 at a location relative to accelerator pedal 26.<br>
Securing may include fixing accelerator pedal actuator 38 to a vehicle<br>
structure such as brake pedal 28 (as seen in Figure 3). Pneumatic pressure<br>
may be supplied to second chamber 44 by fluid supply 60 and may be applied<br>
to second actuating member 58 by opening second valve member 54 to a first<br>
position providing fluid communication between first and third fluid passages<br>
46, 49. The pneumatic pressure may force second actuating member 58<br>
axially inwardly against the biasing force applied by spring 59 to clamp brake<br>
pedal 28 against main body structure 40 of accelerator pedal actuator 38.<br>
[0026] As indicated at step 106, accelerator pedal 26 may then be<br>
displaced a predetermined distance. The predetermined distance for<br>
displacement of first actuating member 56 may be provided by the stroke of<br>
first actuating member 56. The stroke of first actuating member 56 may<br>
generally be defined by first and second stops 43, 45. Alternatively, the<br>
stroke of first actuating member 56 may be defined by using stops or other<br>
displacement limiting devices outside of main body structure 40.<br>
[0027] In the disengaged position (seen in Figure 2), first actuating<br>
member 56 may abut first stop 43 and may be in a first position relative to<br>
accelerator pedal 26. More specifically, first actuating member 56 may<br>
generally be in a spaced relation relative to accelerator pedal 26. The initial<br>
position of accelerator pedal 26 relative to brake pedal 28 may be known and<br>
may therefore provide a reference for displacement of accelerator pedal 26<br>
since accelerator pedal actuator 38 is mounted to brake pedal 28 and first<br>
actuating member 56 is displaced relative thereto. Alternatively, first actuating<br>
member 56 may be placed in contact with accelerator pedal 26 when first<br>
actuating member 56 abuts first stop 43 while accelerator pedal 26 is at its<br>
fully returned position.<br><br>
7<br>
[0028] Once first actuating member 56 is displaced by a distance<br>
generally equal to the spaced relation from accelerator pedal 26, accelerator<br>
pedal 26 may be displaced therewith. Therefore, the displacement of<br>
accelerator pedal 26 may generally be defined as the stroke of first actuating<br>
member 56 less the initial spaced relation between first actuating member 56<br>
and accelerator pedal 26. More specifically, accelerator pedal 26 may be<br>
displaced by pneumatic pressure supplied to first chamber 42 and applied to<br>
first actuating member 56 by opening first valve member 52 to a first position<br>
providing fluid communication between first and second fluid passages 46, 48.<br>
The pneumatic pressure may force first actuating member 56 axially<br>
outwardly against the biasing force of spring 57 to displace accelerator pedal<br>
26. First actuating member 56 may be displaced axially outwardly until first<br>
actuating member 56 engages second stop 45.<br>
[0029] As indicated at step 108, accelerator pedal actuator 38 may<br>
then disengage accelerator pedal 26. Accelerator pedal actuator 38 may<br>
release accelerator pedal 26 by venting first chamber 42. First chamber 42<br>
may be vented by opening first valve member 52 to a second position. In the<br>
second position, first valve member 52 may provide fluid communication<br>
between second and fourth fluid passages 48, 50, venting first chamber 42 to<br>
the atmosphere. Spring 57 may then bias first actuating member 56 back to<br>
the disengaged position (seen in Figure 2).<br>
[0030] As indicated at step 110, accelerator pedal actuator 38 may<br>
then be released from engagement with vehicle 10. Accelerator pedal<br>
actuator 38 may be removed from brake pedal 28 by venting second chamber<br>
44. Second chamber 44 may be vented by opening second valve member 54<br>
to a second position. In the second position, second valve member 54 may<br>
provide fluid communication between third and fifth fluid passages 49, 51,<br>
venting second chamber 44 to the atmosphere. Spring 59 may then bias<br>
second actuating member 58 back to the disengaged position (seen in Figure<br>
2). Accelerator pedal actuator 38 may then be removed from brake pedal 28.<br><br>
