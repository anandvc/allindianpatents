				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROL OF LAYER THICKNESSES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATON<br>
This application claims priority of US Appl. No. 60/431,346,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention generally relates to the field of spin<br>
coating of substrates, especially to a method and apparatus<br>
for controlling the thickness distribution of the coating<br>
by controlling the temperature distribution of the coating<br>
on the substrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As is well known in the prior art, especially in the field<br>
of semiconductor manufacturing but also in certain areas of<br>
optics or biotechnology, a homogenous distribution of<br>
liquids on a essentially plane substrate may be achieved by<br>
rotating (spinning) a substrate around an axis normal to the<br>
plane given by its surface. By applying a viscous liquid<br>
onto the surface during spinning centrifugal forces affect a<br>
distribution of the liquid radially outwards over the<br>
surface. Such „spinning" technique is used to disperse e. g.<br>
lacquer, resins, photo resist on semiconductor substrates.<br>
Moreover it is utilised in the production of optical data<br>
storage technology to provide an essentially homogeneous<br>
layer of resin, lacquer, adhesive etc.. A special case is<br>
the production of all type of DVD formats which require the<br>
bonding of two half-disks.<br><br>
A standard process for such distribution method is:<br>
1)	Dispensing a liquid on the substrate to be coated;<br>
eventually rotating it slowly during this step to achieve a<br>
advantageous initial spreading.<br>
2)	Spinning the disk at high speed (typically a few hundred<br>
rpm up to 12.000 rpm) to homogeneously distribute the<br>
liquid.<br>
The thickness of the layer depends on parameters such as<br>
viscosity, temperature, rotation speed and rotation time.<br>
For substrates with a centre hole the profile of the spin<br>
coated layer thickness shows a low-high trend from the inner<br>
radius towards the outer edge. This is due the fact that<br>
there is no liquid material at / close to the centre hole<br>
which could flow outwards. This lack of material causes the<br>
reduced thickness at small radii.<br>
The variation of the thickness distribution therefore will<br>
not be reduced to a minimized level by standard spin coating<br>
process. In order to achieve an optimized coating condition,<br>
an extra treatment during spin coating process is required.<br>
Moreover, for substrates without a centre hole it is<br>
difficult to achieve ramped thickness distributions, as<br>
would be of interest e. g. for photo resist coating<br>
thickness in mastering applications.<br>
It is therefore desirable to have a method to influence the<br>
radial thickness distribution during the spinning process.<br>
The radial thickness dependence of a liquid's thickness is<br>
dictated by the physics of the spinning process and cannot<br>
be avoided with radially constant viscosity of the liquid.<br>
The objective of the invention therefore is to provide a<br><br>
method for controlling the viscosity of the liquid to be<br>
distributed during spinning.<br>
DESCRIPTION OP PRIOR ART<br>
In semiconductor manufacturing the use of cooling or heating<br>
chucks is widely known. Onto these chucks the semiconductor<br>
substrates, normally a wafer, are clamped and by thermal<br>
contact with the (heated or cooled) chuck the substrates'<br>
temperature is adjusted according to the needs of the<br>
particular processing step. However, such chucks seek to<br>
adjust temperatures homogenously over the complete area of<br>
the substrate.<br>
A use and continuation of that principle is being shown in<br>
US 6,242,044 B1. This document describes a method to adjust<br>
the temperature of a CD radially from the centre to the<br>
edge. This is achieved in an embodiment with a central<br>
rotating shaft with a thereon mounted plate for carrying the<br>
CD.<br>
The bottom of the shaft only is being actively cooled and<br>
via thermal conductivity a thermal gradient over the plate<br>
is being formed. The drawbacks of this method are as<br>
follows: The temperature gradient is being dependant on the<br>
material of the chuck and the environmental conditions such<br>
as ambient temperature. Moreover the system will need time<br>
to achieve a stable condition, i. e. the thermal gradient<br>
must develop.<br>
Furthermore polycarbonate is a relatively good thermal<br>
insulator, therefore cooling and/or heating a liquid<br>
dispensed on the surface via the plastic substrate is<br>
inefficient.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To influence the liquid's viscosity in a spin coating<br>
process, especially the resin layer thickness distribution<br>
of spin-coated substrates with a centre hole (e.g. optical<br>
disks like DVD, CD, Blu-Ray...etc.), a temperature gradient<br>
is created locally selectively before or during a spinning<br>
process by a heat source directed to the side of the<br>
substrate where the liquid is distributed on. Alternatively<br>
a cooling source can be used to achieve such a temperature<br>
gradient.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
One embodiment of the invention comprises a stream of hot<br>
(temperature range 40-90°C) gas directed on the outer radius<br>
of the disk during spinning, in order to change the liquid's<br>
viscosity over the radius of the disk.<br>
In another embodiment, the stream of hot gas is directed via<br>
suitable means onto several areas of the substrate. Another<br>
embodiment allows to control temperature and/or flow of gas<br>
selectively to precisely control the liquid's viscosity and<br>
thereby thickness distribution of the liquid on the spin<br>
coated substrate. „Gas" is to be understood in the broadest<br>
manner, such as simple air or cleaned gases provided from<br>
gas reservoirs. Heating of the gas may be achieved<br>
electrically via a resistance heating or other technical<br>
suitable means.<br>
This thermal conditioning may in another embodiment of the<br>
invention be achieved by sources of electromagnetic<br>
radiation. This may comprise lamps with essential visible<br>
spectra or IR spectra.<br><br>
In a further emodiment the invention's thermal source may<br>
comprise several sub sources, which can advantageously be<br>
directed to different locations of the substrate during<br>
spinning. This results in a control of thermal conditions in<br>
an essential circular region around the axis of rotation.<br>
Technically this may be achieved by e. g. a plurality of<br>
nozzles, directing heated or cooled gases to such regions of<br>
the substrate. Another variety is to use a plurality of<br>
lamps, such as IR radiators or halogen lamps, being arranged<br>
to aim at different locations of the substrate.<br>
In case of gas nozzles, thermal conditioning of the<br>
substrate can easily be adjusted by regulating gas flow<br>
and/or temperature of the gas. In case of lamps this can be<br>
accomplished by regulating the power distributed to the<br>
respective lamp. For both cases the angle of the nozzle or<br>
lamp with respect to the plane of the substrate is a further<br>
parameter to finetune the thermal conditioning.<br>
An apparatus suitable to implement the invention may<br>
comprise a rotatable support, dispensing means to spread a<br>
liquid on the surface of the substrate and means to fasten<br>
at least one thermal source in a position with respect to<br>
the substrate, where it can influence the thermal condition<br>
of the substrate. In one embodiment this fastening means may<br>
comprise a cover with the thermal source and, eventually,<br>
dispensing means affixed to it.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the thermal sources are attached<br>
to an arm, which extends over at least a portion of the<br>
rotatable support. This arm, cover or in general fastening<br>
means may be movable in a way to clear the area of the<br>
substrate/support in order to load and unload the substrate<br>
from and to the support.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a rotational support<br>
with a substrate.<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of the invention with an arm<br>
extending over the substrate with several thermal sources.<br>
Figure 3 shows the result of an experiment according to the<br>
invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a substrate 1 on a support 2. The substrate<br>
has a centre hole which allows to centering it around a<br>
rotation axis 3. The arrow indicates the rotation of support<br>
and substrate. Driving means for rotation are not shown.<br>
During rotation excess liquid is being spinned outwards,<br>
shields 4 and 6 protect the environment from such excess<br>
liquid.<br>
Figure 2 shows the embodiment of Figure 1 with a movable arm<br>
11 with a source of radiation 10. The movability of arm 11<br>
is indicated by arrows 12. As can easily be understood, the<br>
arm may be moved linearily, pivoted horizontally or<br>
vertically or in any other suitable manner to clear the area<br>
of substrate and support. This may be especially necessary<br>
when the substrate is being loaded or unloaded from the<br>
support. Loading and unloading mechanisms are not shown,<br>
they can be construed according to the state of the art.<br>
Arrows 13 indicate the effective direction of a plurality of<br>
thermal sub sources.<br>
In an application of the inventive method in an apparatus<br>
according to the invention, substrate 1 is being placed by<br><br>
suitable means on support 2. Substrate 1 may be a<br>
semiconductor wafer, a datastorage media such as a CD, DVD<br>
or alike or any essentially flat workpiece. In a preferred<br>
embodiment arm 11 carries as well thermal sources as<br>
dispensing means, so after placing the arm above the<br>
substrate liquid could be dispensed. This way the liquid is<br>
being spread upon the surface of substrate 1, eventually<br>
while being rotated slowly. After spreading the liquid the<br>
spinning of the substrate is initiated and in parallel to or<br>
shortly after start of spinning the thermal conditioning<br>
begins. The conditioning time can be defined by precedent<br>
experiments, or alternatively contact free measurement means<br>
determine the end of the thermal conditioning.<br>
Furtheron edge effects, like the build up of droplets at the<br>
edge of spin coated substrates can be avoided by selectively<br>
directing a thermal source at such edge.<br>
Basically the thermal source(s) locally influence the<br>
viscosity of the liquid, such that a desired distribution,<br>
homogenous or a selectively inhomogenous, on the surface of<br>
the substrate is being achieved.<br>
In another way of using the invention the order of steps may<br>
be changed, in a way, that the substrate is being preheated<br>
in the way described, the liquid being dispensed and spinned<br>
afterwards. This may be advantageous for applications, where<br>
e. g. mechanical, physical or chemical constraints do not<br>
allow the order described beforehand. In this case the<br>
thermal capacity of the substrate must be sufficient to hold<br>
the thermal gradient until the liquid's visosity can be<br>
influenced.<br><br>
The inventive method may be performed at a single process<br>
station, where the thermal source, dispensing means and<br>
rotatable means are being joined. However it may be<br>
beneficial to distribute the steps of thermal conditioning,<br>
dispensing and spinning to several process modules.<br>
Figure 3 shows results of a single heat source (flow of<br>
heated air) being directed to an outer region of an optical<br>
storage media during spin coating with resin. Comparison to<br>
an unconditioned sample shows significant improvement of<br>
layer homogeneity. In contrast to not heated substrates with<br>
monotone increasing thickness as a function of the radius,<br>
the thickness of the partially heated substrates decreases<br>
after reaching a maximum at a radius of about 35-45 mm.<br>
The thermal gradient applied between different areas of a<br>
substrate was just a few degrees, in case of a bonding<br>
lacquer on a DVD half disk about 4° C. Depending on<br>
viscosity and other environmental conditions a thermal<br>
gradient of about 10° C is sufficient for most applications.<br><br>
