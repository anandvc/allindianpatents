				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a urinary tract guard for the control of bacteria causing urinary tract infections.<br>
Urinary tract infections are one of the most common types of naso-comial infections. Bacteria which produce slime, may adhere to each other and to the surfaces through surface-to-surface inter¬action or in some cases, polymer-to-polymer interactions consoli¬dating adhesion and the formation of microcolonies.<br>
Shortly after attachment and adhesion, 
Several documented studies have shown a decrease in the infection rate with closed system as compared with open drainage system. The bacterial colonization of the drainage bag before the deve¬lopment of bladder bacteriuria with the same organisms has also been cited. This is suspected due to the contamination of the drainage port when the collecting bag is emptied.<br><br>
Such methods require the control of bacteria entering the urinary tract and the bladder. The normally used urinary catheters are the Foley's catheters made of silicone rubber, latex, etc.. Silver is known for its wide spectrum of antibacterial effect, both in the metallic as well as ionic states. Silver and its compounds have been used as suture wires, cranial support pistes in the treatment of wounds, burns, etc..<br>
Silver o&gt;;ide coated urinary catheters have been used in the treatment of urinary tract infections and have been found to be better for the prevention of urinary tract infections. A device which has been developed with silver releasing polymers (Silver line) is available in the market. It has a cartridge which releases silver in a controlled way into the downstream, preventing bacteria by inhibiting the survival and multiplication of the organism. This device is used for urinary tract infections. One of its drawbacks is that it is meant for single use after the device has to be removed and a new one put in line. A second problem is the pressure gradient introduced into the system due to the device. A third problem is the build-up of pressure due to the accumulation of particulate matter present in the urine and subsequent failure of the device.<br>
An  object of this invention is to propose a urinary tract  guard for the control of bacteria causing urinary tract infections-<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a urinary tract guard for the control of bacteria causing urinary tract infections which prevents a back flow of urine from the collecting bag into the bladder.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a urinary tract gaurd for the control of bacteria causing urinary tract infections which is capable of controlling urinary tract infection as a part of the closed system as well as the open drainage system.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br><br>
At the outset of the description which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuring description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and teaching of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a urinary tract guard for the control of bacteria using urinary tract infections comprising :<br>
a.	a tubing disposed within a outer cover;<br>
b.	said tubing having an inlet and an outlet end corresponding to<br>
the inlet and outlet end of said outer cover;<br>
c.	a slit valve disposed in the proximity of the distal end of<br>
said tubing;<br>
d.	an outer cover having an inlet connector adapted to be<br>
connected to a Foley's catheter and an outlet connector and an<br>
outlet connector adapted to be connected to a urine bag.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with refe¬rence to the accompanying drawings where<br>
Fig.l shows a block diagram which comprises a UT guard connecting to the urine bag at one end and to the patient through a Foley's catheter at the other end;<br><br>
Fig.2 shows how the UT guard (1) is connected through the inlet connector 
 <br>
The guard consists of a slit valve incorporated in an elastomeric tubing incorporated with an antibacterial compound. The elasto¬meric material may be silicone rubber, polyurethane, latex, etc.. The tubing is safely seated inside an outer cover made of trans¬parent polymeric material. The device has an inlet connector which is made up of transparent plastic, such as polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride. It is attached to the normally used Foley's catheter. The outlet connector is attached to the urine collecting bag via the tubing. Other materials of choice for the fabrication of valve are latex, polyurethane, etc.. These materials are incorporated with a compound having antibacterial effect to the bacteria normally causing urinary tract infection. Such compounds are those having an antibacterial effect such as certain silver compounds. The silver compound is normally an oxide or a complex of silver. Functioning of the device<br>
Urine coming out through the urinary catheter is carried into the guard through the inlet connector. Here, urine comes directly in contact with the antibacterial material. When the pressure inside exceeds 2 to 5 cms of water, the valve opens automatically and urine is allowed to flow towards the exit connector. The exit connector is attached to the urine collection bag. Three means of prevention of bacterial entry is accomplished, (i)<br><br>
Due to the antibacterial effect of the material used for the fabrication of the valve; <ii by the functioning of slit valve presence water barrier which comes mio existence as requirement for opening valve.></ii>
in addition to the above, the antibacterial ntaterial with a  zone of inhibition of 2 to 10  tor different type&amp; of bacteria will further ensure the destruction of bacteria thereby preventing the formation of slime.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
