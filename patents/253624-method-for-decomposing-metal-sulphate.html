				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method of the invention relates to the decomposition in a fluidised bed of<br>
metal sulphates generated in the metallurgical industry. The decomposition<br>
of metal sulphates is carried out so that the metal oxides generated are<br>
recovered in such a pure form that they can be recycled to be used again in<br>
the manufacture of metal alloys such as steel. In particular, sulphates<br>
containing nickel, iron and chrome are decomposed in oxidising conditions<br>
using pyrites or pyrrhotite as the former and fuel of the bed material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metal sulphates are generated in various metallurgical processes such as for<br>
example during steel pickling or in the electrolytic purification of metal into<br>
anodic sludge. Mixed sulphate waste containing sulphuric acid cannot be<br>
used as such anywhere, and is largely hazardous waste.<br>
US patent 4,824,655 describes a method for producing sulphur dioxide by<br>
the thermal decomposition of sulphur-containing metal sulphates in a<br>
fluidized bed. The metal sulphate is mainly iron sulphate, which includes a<br>
small amount of other metals such as compounds of aluminium, magnesium,<br>
titanium, manganese, chrome and vanadium. The sulphate originates largely<br>
from the manufacture of titanium. The decomposition of metal sulphate<br>
occurs at a temperature of 800 - 1100°C. It is essential that sulphur-<br>
containing material, such as sulphur waste or fine pyrites, be used in<br>
sulphate reduction in order to produce the largest possible amount of sulphur<br>
dioxide. The energy required for sulphate reduction is produced with a<br>
carbon-containing fuel such as coal, coke or heavy fuel oil. The majority of<br>
the fuel is introduced with the bed material, but some is fed separately with<br>
the carrier gas. The key point in the method is the production of sulphur<br>
dioxide, and there is no mention of the use of the metal-containing solids that<br>
are generated, so they go to waste. The amount of waste generated in this<br><br>
way is considerable. The feed of extra fuel, particularly of extra liquid or<br>
gaseous fuel, makes it difficult to keep the temperature regulated evenly,<br>
since localised feeding to the bed may result in hot spots, which cause the<br>
sintering of the bed. Carbon-containing fuel creates carbon dioxide<br>
emissions, and the aim is to reduce the amount of these emissions.<br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the method of this invention is to avoid the drawbacks of the<br>
method described above. The aim of the method now developed is to<br>
decompose metal sulphates generated in the metallurgical industry,<br>
particularly mixed sulphates that contain nickel, so that the fuel used in their<br>
decomposition produces bed material on oxidising, whereupon the uniform<br>
distribution of fuel prevents the generation of hot spots. The fuel does not<br>
contain carbon either, so that carbon dioxide emissions are not produced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essential features of the invention will be made apparent in the attached<br>
claims.<br>
The invention relates to a method for the decomposition of a residue<br>
generated in the metallurgical industry, containing at least one metal<br>
sulphate, into oxides. The decomposition of metal sulphide is performed in a<br>
fluidised bed furnace, whereby the energy required for decomposing the<br>
sulphate is obtained from roasting the iron sulphide used as the bed material.<br>
Roasting is performed in oxidising conditions to form an oxide that is<br>
essentially free of sulphur for reuse in the steel industry, and the sulphur<br>
dioxide that is generated is used in the manufacture of sulphur and/or<br>
sulphuric acid.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the metal sulphate is a mixed<br>
sulphate, including nickel, chrome and iron sulphate. Mixed sulphate is for<br>
instance the mixed sulphate generated during the pickling of steel.<br><br>
According to another embodiment of the invention the metal sulphate is<br>
nickel sulphate. Nickel sulphate is formed for instance during the electrolytic<br>
purification of copper.<br>
The iron sulphide used as the fluidised bed material and energy producer is<br>
pyrite and/or pyrrhotite. The decomposition of sulphate is carried out at a<br>
temperature of 800 - 900°C and the residence time in the bed is around 1 -<br>
5 h. The sulphur concentration of the alloy of the oxide or oxides formed is a<br>
maximum of 0.5%.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Impure sulphate sediments are generated in the metallurgical industry, such<br>
as in steel manufacture and the electrolytic purification of metals, which<br>
contain sulphates of nickel, chrome and iron etc. Sulphates are soluble<br>
enough that they cannot be removed from the circuit as they are but in<br>
addition their metal content should be recovered in an environment-friendly<br>
way. As described in the prior art, sulphate residues, in particular those<br>
generated during the manufacture of titanium, are treated in a fluidised bed<br>
furnace, but mainly in order to produce sulphur dioxide gas for the<br>
manufacture of sulphuric acid.<br>
Mixed sulphate precipitate is generated in the pickling stage of steel<br>
manufacture, containing in addition to iron sulphates (FeSO4H2O, Fe2(SO4)3)<br>
also nickel and chrome sulphate (NiSO4, Cr2(SO4)3) and sulphuric acid. In<br>
oxidising conditions iron sulphates and chrome sulphate decompose at a far<br>
lower temperature than nickel sulphate. Nickel sulphate may also<br>
decompose at lower temperatures in reducing conditions, but then there is a<br>
danger that in addition to oxides, sulphides will also form. When the purpose<br>
is to produce a product fit for a steelworks for example, its sulphur content<br>
must be quite low i.e. below 0.5 %.<br><br>
The end product of the pyrometallurgical fabrication of copper is copper<br>
anode, which is further purified electrolyticaily into pure cathode copper. The<br>
anode sludge that is generated contains the impurities of the anode, of which<br>
nickel in the form of nickel sulphate is one of the most significant.<br>
The decomposition of sulphates into oxides is an endothermic reaction. In<br>
the method according to the prior art, the bed of the fluidised bed furnace<br>
was formed so that reducing sulphur-containing material and some of the<br>
carbon-containing fuel were mixed with the sulphates, pelletised and then fed<br>
into the furnace. In addition, part of the fuel was fed separately. In the<br>
method now developed the fuel required for decomposition acts as the bed<br>
material i.e. no separate carbon-containing fuel is required at all. Iron<br>
sulphide such as pyrite or pyrrhotite acts as the fuel and bed material, which<br>
is roasted and, simultaneously, the sulphates fed into the bed are<br>
decomposed into their oxides. The reactions that occur in iron sulphide<br>
roasting are so exothermic that the heat generated is enough for the<br>
endothermic reactions required in sulphate decomposition without the need<br>
for any extra heat.<br>
Sulphate decomposition is carried out at a temperature of 800 - 900°C and<br>
the residence time in the bed is around 1 - 5 h. In particular the<br>
decomposition of nickel sulphate requires the temperature mentioned above,<br>
in order for the decomposition into oxides to take place in a reasonable time.<br>
The invention relates thus to a method for the decomposition of one or more<br>
metal sulphates, where nickel sulphate is preferably one of the sulphates.<br>
Sulphate decomposition is carried out in oxidising conditions, in order to<br>
avoid sulphur remaining in any form among the oxides. Sulphur-free oxides<br>
are fit for reuse e.g. in a steelworks. The sulphur dioxide-containing gases<br>
that are formed are routed to sulphur and/or sulphuric acid manufacture, but<br>
the process is regulated on the basis of producing metal oxides that are as<br>
pure as possible rather than sulphur dioxide production.<br><br>
It is preferable to keep the sulphur content of the oxide alloy to be fed to the<br>
steelworks as small as possible, since it will reduce the demand for oxygen<br>
used for sulphur removal in conversion.<br>
When all the energy required for sulphate decomposition is brought in the<br>
form of bed material, the drawbacks that can arise from feeding fuel to the<br>
bed separately can be avoided. The use of separate fuel is awkward<br>
because it is difficult to feed it into the bed so evenly that no localised hot<br>
spots are generated where the bed material and sulphates would be<br>
sintered. Hot localised points are also harmful to the equipment. Introducing<br>
a separate fuel to the fluidised bed means carbon-containing material,<br>
generally feeding gas into the bed. The drawback of carbon-containing fuel<br>
is that the fuel produces carbon dioxide emissions and in addition it requires<br>
a post-combustion chamber as additional equipment.<br>
When iron sulphides are used as the energy producer in the fluidised bed<br>
decomposition of sulphates, it is easy to control the shutdown of the bed nor<br>
does a malfunction in the sulphate feed cause problems. When using iron<br>
sulphides the operation is run in oxidising conditions, and there are no<br>
additional sulphides to be burnt in the bed. If the operation is run in reducing<br>
conditions and there is a malfunction, then the sulphides burn and hot spots,<br>
molten phase and sintering occur.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
The decomposition of impure nickel sulphate was carried out in a fluidised<br>
bed furnace using pyrite as bed material and fuel. Air was used as the<br>
fluidising air and fluidising was carried out at a rate of 0.2 m/s in slightly<br>
oxidising conditions. After 1.5 h the sulphur concentration of the nickel oxide<br>
removed from the furnace was 0.34 % and after 3 h It was 0.15 %, so that it<br>
was highly suitable for recycling to the steel industry.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The decomposition of mixed sulphate was performed in a fluidised bed<br>
furnace, where the composition of the mixed sulphate was Fe 12.8%, Cr<br>
1.8%, Ni 1.8%, Mo 0.08% and SO4 44.4%. Pyrite was used as fuel and bed<br>
material. Air was used as the fluidising air and fluidising was carried out at a<br>
rate of 0.2 m/s in slightly oxidising conditions. After 1.5 h the sulphur<br>
concentration of the oxide mixture removed from the furnace was 0.32 % and<br>
after 3 h it was 0.17 %, so it was highly suitable for recycling to the steel<br>
industry.<br><br>
