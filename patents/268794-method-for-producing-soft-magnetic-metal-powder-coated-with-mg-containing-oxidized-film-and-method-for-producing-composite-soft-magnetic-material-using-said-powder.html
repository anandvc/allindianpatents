DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING SOFT MAGNETIC METAL POWDER COATED WITH<br>
Mg-CONTAINING OXIDE FILM AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING COMPOSITE<br>
SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIAL USING SAID POWDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film, and a method for producing a composite soft magnetic material using the soft magnetic metal powder coated with the Mg-containing oxide film. The composite soft magnetic material is used, for example, as a raw material for various electromagnet circuit components, such as a magnetic core, motor core, generator core, solenoid core, ignition core, reactor core, transcore, choke coil core and magnetic sensor core.<br>
[0002]<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a raw powder material for producing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with the Mg-containing oxide film.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]<br>
Conventionally, it is known that soft magnetic materials used for various electromagnet circuit components, such as a magnetic core, motor core, generator core, solenoid core, ignition core, reactor core, transcore, choke coil core and magnetic sensor core are required to have low iron loss, and thus, required to have high electric resistance<br><br>
2 <br>
and low coercivity. Further, in recent years, miniaturization and high response have<br>
been a requirement in electromagnetic circuits. Therefore, an improvement of magnetic flux density is also of related importance.<br>
[0004]<br>
As an example of a magnetic core consisting of such a soft magnetic material, a laminate steel plate is known which is obtained by coating and laminating an insulating layer consisting of MgO on a surface of a soft magnetic metal plate (see Patent Document 1). However, although this steel plate is satisfactory in both of magnetic flux density and electric resistance, it is difficult to produce an electromagnetic component having a complex shape from such a steel plate. For producing an electromagnetic component having a complex shape, a method is known in which a surface of a soft magnetic metal powder is coated with a MgO insulating film by a wet method such as chemical plating or coating to obtain a composite soft magnetic metal powder, and the thus obtained composite soft magnetic metal powder is subjected to press molding, followed by sintering. Further, a method is known in which a soft magnetic metal powder is mixed with a Mg ferrite powder and subjected to press molding, followed by sintering, to thereby obtain a sintered, composite soft magnetic material having MgO as an insulating layer.<br>
[0005]<br>
As the soft magnetic metal powder, an iron powder, an insulated-iron powder, an Fe-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Ni iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Cr iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Si iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Si-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Co iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Co-V iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, or Fe-P iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is generally known.<br><br>

No. 63-226011<br>
[0006]<br>
Furthermore, as a soft magnetic material for use in various electromagnetic components, a composite magnetic material is proposed in which a substance having high resistivity is provided between iron powder particles. For example, a method for producing a compacted-powder magnetic core is known in which a mixture of an iron powder, a SiO2-forming compound, and MgCO3 or MgO is subjected to powder compaction to obtain a shaped article, and the obtained shaped article is maintained at a temperature of 500 to l,100°C, thereby forming a glass phase containing SiO2 and MgO as main components between iron powder particles to provide insulation between iron powder particles (see Patent Document 1).<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2003-217919<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]<br>
However, the above-mentioned method for producing a composite soft magnetic metal powder in which a surface of a soft magnetic material is coated with a MgO insulating film by a wet method such as chemical plating or coating has disadvanatges in that the method is costly and mass production is difficult, and that, hence, a composite soft magnetic metal powder produced by this method is expensive, and a composite soft magnetic material produced therefrom is also expensive. Further, in a composite soft magnetic metal powder produced by this method, the MgO insulating film is more stable than the soft magnetic metal powder, so that a diffusion reaction hardly occurs between<br><br>
4<br>
the MgO insulating film and the surface of the soft magnetic metal powder. As a result,<br>
the adhesion of the formed MgO insulating film to the surface of the soft magnetic metal powder becomes insufficient. Therefore, when this composite soft magnetic metal powder produced by a wet method is subjected to press molding, the MgO insulating film is broken, so that a satisfactory insulation effect cannot be achieved, and hence, a composite soft magnetic material produced from this composite soft magnetic metal powder cannot exhibit a satisfactorily high resistance.<br>
[0008]<br>
On the other hand, the above-mentioned method in which an insulative Mg ferrite powder is added and mixed with a soft magnetic metal powder, followed by pressing and sintering is advantageous in that the production cost is low, so that a composite soft magnetic material can be provided at a low cost. However, the composite soft magnetic material obtained by this method is disadvantageous in that it possesses a microstructure in which MgO is biasedly dispersed at triple junctions of three grain boundaries of soft magnetic metal particles, and MgO is not homogeneously dispersed in grain boundaries, and hence, the composite soft magnetic material exhibits a low resistivity.<br>
[0009]<br>
Further, with respect to conventional composite soft magnetic, sintered materials, among the properties of density, flexural strength, resistivity and magnetic flux density, resistivity is especially unsatisfactory. Therefore, a composite soft magnetic, sintered material having a higher resistivity has been desired.<br>
[0010]<br>
In this situation, the present inventors have performed extensive and intensive studies with a view toward solving the above-mentioned problems. As a result, they<br><br>
5 found the following.<br>
[0011]<br>
(a)	A soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film,<br>
namely, a soft magnetic metal powder having a Mg-containing oxide insulating film on<br>
the surface thereof can be obtained by subjecting a soft magnetic metal powder to<br>
oxidation treatment to provide a raw powder material; adding and mixing a Mg powder<br>
to the raw powder material to obtain a mixed powder; heating the mixed powder at a<br>
temperature of 150 to l,100°C in an inert gas or vacuum atmosphere under a pressure of<br>
1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa; and optionally heating the resultant product in an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere at a temperature of 50 to 400°C. This soft magnetic metal powder coated<br>
with a Mg-containing oxide film has excellent adhesion properties as compared to a<br>
conventional soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg ferrite film as the<br>
Mg-containing oxide film, so that it can be subjected to press molding to obtain a<br>
compacted powder article with reduced occurrence of breaking and delaminating of the<br>
insulating film. Further, by sintering the thus obtained compacted powder article at a<br>
temperature of 400 to l,300°C, there can be obtained a composite soft magnetic material<br>
having a microstructure in which MgO is homogeneously dispersed in grain boundaries,<br>
and MgO is not biasedly dispersed at triple junctions of three grain boundaries of soft<br>
magnetic metal particles.<br>
[0012]<br>
(b)	In a method including subjecting a soft magnetic metal to oxidation<br>
treatment to provide a raw powder material, adding and mixing an Mg powder with the<br>
raw powder material to obtain a mixed powder, and heating the mixed powder at a<br>
temperature of 150 to l,100°C in an inert or vacuum atmosphere under a pressure of<br>
1 x 1 0-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa, it is preferable to perform the heating of the mixed powder while<br><br>
6 tumbling the mixed powder.<br>
[0013]<br>
(c)	As the soft magnetic metal powder, any one of those conventionally known<br>
can be used, such as an iron powder, an insulated-iron powder, Fe-Al iron-based soft<br>
magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Ni iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Cr iron-based<br>
soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Si iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Si-Al<br>
iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Co iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder,<br>
Fe-Co-V iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, or Fe-P iron-based soft magnetic alloy<br>
powder.<br>
[0014]<br>
(d)	A soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film,<br>
namely, a soft magnetic metal powder having a Mg-Si-containing oxide film formed on<br>
the surface thereof can be obtained by maintainingc a soft magnetic powder in an<br>
oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of room temperature to 500°C to provide a soft<br>
magnetic powder coated with an oxide; adding and mixing a silicon monoxide powder<br>
with the soft magnetic powder coated with an oxide; performing heating in a vacuum<br>
atmosphere at a temperature of 600 to l,200°C during or following the mixing of a<br>
silicon monoxide powder with the soft magnetic powder; adding and mixing a Mg<br>
powder with the resultant; and performing heating in a vacuum atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of 400 to 800°C during or following the mixing of a Mg powder with the<br>
resultant. A composite soft magnetic, sintered material produced from this soft<br>
magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film has excellent<br>
properties with respect to density, flexural strength, resistivity and magnetic flux density,<br>
as compared to a conventional composite soft magnetic, sintered material obtained by<br>
subjecting a mixture of a SiO2-forming compound and MgCO3 or MgO to compression<br><br>
7 molding, followed by sintering.<br>
[0015]<br>
(e)	A soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film,<br>
namely, a soft magnetic metal powder having a Mg-Si-containing oxide film formed on<br>
the surface thereof can be obtained by maintaining a soft magnetic powder in an<br>
oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of room temperature to 500°C to provide a soft<br>
magnetic powder coated with an oxide; adding and mixing a silicon monoxide powder<br>
and a Mg powder with the soft magnetic powder coated with an oxide; and performing<br>
heating in a vacuum atmosphere at a temperature of 400 to l,200°C during or following<br>
the mixing of a silicon monoxide powder and a Mg powder with the soft magnetic<br>
powder coated with an oxide. A composite soft magnetic, sintered material produced<br>
from this soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film has<br>
excellent properties with respect to density, flexural strength, resistivity and magnetic<br>
flux density, as compared to a conventional composite soft magnetic, sintered material<br>
obtained by subjecting a mixture of a SiO2-forming compound and MgCO3 or MgO to<br>
compression molding, followed by sintering.<br>
[0016]<br>
(f)	A soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film,<br>
namely, a soft magnetic metal powder having a Mg-containing oxide film formed on the<br>
surface thereof can be obtained by maintaining a soft magnetic powder in an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere at a temperature of room temperature to 500°C to provide a soft magnetic<br>
powder coated with an oxide; adding and mixing a Mg powder with the soft magnetic<br>
powder coated with an oxide; and performing heating in a vacuum atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of 400 to 800°C during or following the mixing of a Mg powder with the<br>
soft magnetic powder coated with an oxide. Further, a soft magnetic metal powder<br><br>
8<br>
coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film, namely, a soft magnetic metal powder having<br>
a Mg-Si-containing oxide film formed on the surface thereof can be obtained by adding and mixing a silicon monoxide powder with the soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film; and performing heating in a vacuum atmosphere at a temperature of 600 to l,200°C during or following the mixing of a silicon monoxide powder with the soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film. A composite soft magnetic, sintered material produced from this soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film has excellent properties with respect to density, flexural strength, resistivity and magnetic flux density, as compared to a conventional composite soft magnetic, sintered material obtained by subjecting a mixture of a SiO2-forming compound and MgCO3 or MgO to compression molding, followed by sintering.<br>
[0017]<br>
(g) The silicon monoxide is added preferably in an amount of 0.01 to 1% by mass, and the Mg powder is added preferably in an amount of 0.05 to 1% by mass.<br>
[0018]<br>
(h) The vacuum atmosphere is preferably an atmosphere under a pressure of l x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa.<br>
[0019]<br>

[0029]<br>
(10)	the method according to any one of items (6 )to (9) above, wherein the<br>

(11)	the method according to any one of items (6) to (10) above, wherein the<br>
vacuum atmosphere is an atmosphere under a pressure of 1 x 101-2 to1 x 10-1 MPa.<br>
[0031]<br>
Among silicon oxides, silicon monoxide (SiO) has the highest vapor pressure, so it can easily deposit a silicon oxide component on a surface of a soft magnetic powder by heating. Therefore, it is not preferable to mix silicon dioxide (SiO2) having a low vapor pressure with silicon monoxide because a silicon oxide film having a satisfactory thickness cannot be formed on a surface of a soft magnetic powder by heating. By adding and mixing a silicon monoxide powder with an oxide-coated soft magnetic powder, and performing heating in a vacuum atmosphere at a temperature of 600 to 1,200°C during or following the mixing, a soft magnetic powder coated with a silicon oxide film, namely, a soft magnetic powder having a SiOx film (wherein x = 1 or 2) formed on the surface thereof can be produced. Further, by adding and mixing a Mg<br><br>
12<br>
powder with this soft magnetic powder coated with a silicon oxide film while heating in<br>
a vacuum atmosphere, a soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide including Mg-Si-Fe-0 can be obtained.<br>
[0032]<br>
The oxide-coated soft magnetic powder can be produced by heating a soft magnetic powder in an oxidizing atmosphere (e.g., air) at a temperature of room temperature to 500°C, thereby forming an iron oxide film on a surface of the soft magnetic powder. This iron oxide film has the effect of improving the coatability of SiO and/or Mg. In the production of the oxide-coated soft magnetic powder, when the heating in an oxidizing atmosphere is performed at a temperature higher than 500°C, disadvantages are caused in that particles of the soft magnetic powder agglomerate to form an aggregate which is sintered, such that a homogeneous surface oxidation cannot be achieved. For this reason, the heating temperature in the production of an oxide-coated soft magnetic powder is set in the range of room temperature to 500°C. The heating temperature is more preferably in the range of room temperature to 300°C. The oxidizing atmosphere is preferably a dry oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
[0033]<br>
In the method for producing a soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film according to the present invention, the reasons for limiting the amount of SiO powder added to the oxide-coated soft magnetic powder in the range of 0.01 to 1% by mass are as follows. When the amount of SiO added is less than 0.01% by mass, the thickness of the silicon oxide film formed on a surface of the oxide-coated soft magnetic powder becomes unsatisfactory, so that the amount of Si in the Mg-Si-containing oxide film becomes unsatisfactory, thereby causing a disadvantage in that a Mg-Si-containing oxide film having high resistivity cannot be obtained. On<br><br>
13 <br>
the other hand, when the amount of SiO added is more than 1% by mass, the thickness of<br>
the silicon oxide film (SiOx film (x = 1 or 2)) becomes too large, thereby causing a disadvantage in that the density of a composite soft magnetic material obtained by subjecting the soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film to powder compaction and sintering is lowered.<br>
[0034]<br>
Further, in the method for producing a soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film according to the present invention, the reasons for limiting the amount of Mg powder added to the oxide-coated soft magnetic powder in the range of 0.05 to 1 % by mass are as follows. When the amount of Mg added is less than 0.05% by mass, the thickness of the Mg film formed on a surface of the oxide-coated soft magnetic film becomes unsatisfactory, thereby causing a disadvantage in that the amount of Mg in the Mg-Si-containing oxide film becomes unsatisfactory, and hence, a Mg-Si-containing oxide film having a satisfactory thickness cannot be obtained. On the other hand, when the amount of Mg added is more than 1% by mass, the thickness of the Mg film becomes too large, thereby causing a disadvantage in that the density of a composite soft magnetic material obtained by subjecting the soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film to powder compaction and sintering is lowered.<br>
[0035]<br>
In the method for producing a soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film according to the present invention, the reasons for setting the conditions for adding and mixing a SiO powder, a Mg powder, or a mixed powder of SiO and Mg with an oxide-coated soft magnetic powder as a vacuum atmosphere at a temperature of 600 to l,200°C are as follows. When the heating is performed at a temperature lower than 600°C, the vapor pressure of SiO is too low, so that a SiO film or<br><br>
14<br>
Mg-Si-containing oxide film having a satisfactory thickness cannot be obtained. On the<br>
other hand, when the heating is performed at a temperature higher than l,200°C, the soft magnetic powder is sintered, so that a desired soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide cannot be obtained. The heating is preferably performed in a vacuum atmosphere under a pressure of 1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa, more preferably while tumbling.<br>
[0036]<br>
As the soft magnetic powder for producing an oxide-coated soft magnetic powder, it is preferable to use a soft magnetic powder having an average particle diameter in the range of 5 to 500 urn. The reasons for this are as follows. When the average particle diameter is smaller than 5 urn, the compressibility of the powder becomes low, so that the volume ratio of the soft magnetic powder becomes low, and the magnetic flux density becomes low. On the other hand, when the average particle diameter is larger than 500 µm, the eddy current generated in the soft magnetic powder increases, and the magnetic permeability becomes low at high frequencies.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the method for producing a soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-Si-containing oxide film according to the present invention, it is necessary to use an oxide-coated soft magnetic powder as a raw powder material, which is obtained by forming an iron oxide film on a surface of a soft magnetic powder.

[0043]<br>
By using a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film which is produced by the method of any one of items (1), (5), (7), (8) and (9) above, a composite soft magnetic material having excellent resistivity and mechanical strength can be produced. Accordingly, the present invention also provides:<br>
[0044]<br>
(16)	a method for producing a composite soft magnetic material having<br>
excellent resistivity and mechanical strength, including the steps of: subjecting a soft<br>
magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method<br>
of any one of items (1), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) above to press molding; and sintering the<br>

items (1), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) above, followed by powder compaction; and sintering<br>
the resultant at a temperature of 500 to 1,000°C.<br>
[0046]<br>
In the method for producing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film according to the present invention, for producing a mixed<br><br>
17<br>
powder by adding and mixing a Mg powder with a soft magnetic metal powder which<br>
has been subjected to oxidation treatment, it is preferable to add the Mg powder in an amount of 0.05 to 2% by mass, based on the mass of the soft magnetic metal powder which has been subjected to oxidation treatment. When the amount of Mg powder added is less than 0.05% by mass, based on the mass of the soft magnetic metal powder, the amount of Mg coating formed is unsatisfactory, so that a Mg-containing oxide film having sufficient thickness cannot be obtained. On the other hand, when the Mg powder is added in an amount of more than 2% by mass, the thickness of the Mg coating becomes too large, so that the thickness of the Mg-containing oxide film becomes too large, thereby causing a disadvantage in that the magnetic flux density of a composite soft magnetic material obtained by subjecting the soft magnetic powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film to powder compaction and sintering is lowered.<br>
[0047]<br>
The oxidization treatment of a soft magnetic metal powder has the effect of improving the coatability of Mg, and is performed by maintaining the treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of 50 to 500°C, or maintaining the treatment in distilled water or pure water at a temperature of 50 to 100°C. In either case, the oxidization treatment is not effective when the temperature is lower than 50°C. On the other hand, when the oxidization treatment is performed by maintaining an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature higher than 500°C, an unfavorable sintering occurs. The oxidizing atmosphere is preferably a dry oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
[0048]<br>
Fig. 1 exemplifies various patterns of variation of temperature with time during oxidation treatment of a soft magnetic metal powder. Generally, oxidation treatment is performed by heating in an oxidizing atmosphere in a manner as shown by the pattern<br><br>
18<br>
indicated in Fig. 1 A. However, the oxidation treatment may also be performed in a<br>
manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. lB, in which the temperature is elevated to a relatively low temperature and maintained, and then the temperature is elevated to a higher temperature and maintained. Further, the oxidation treatment may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 1C, in which the temperature is elevated to a relatively high temperature and maintained, and then the temperature is lowered to a lower temperature and maintained. Furthermore, the oxidation treatment may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. lD, in which the temperature is elevated and lowered without substantially being maintained. Alternatively, when the oxidation treatment is performed in distilled water or pure water, any one of the patterns shown in Figs 1A to lD may be used, wherein the upper and lower limits of the temperature range are 100°C and 50°C, respectively. In the method for producing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film according to the present invention, the patterns of variation of temperature with time during oxidation treatment of a soft magnetic metal powder are not limited to those shown in Fig. 1, and may be changed freely within the range of 50 to 500°C.<br>
[0049]<br>
A Mg powder is added and mixed with a soft magnetic metal powder which has been subjected to oxidation treatment, and the resulting mixed powder is heated at a temperature of 150 to l,100°C in an inert gas or vacuum atmosphere under a pressure of 1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa, while optionally tumbling. The reason for defining the heating atmosphere as an inert gas or vacuum atmosphere under a pressure of 1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa is that such an atmosphere includes a high vacuum, inert gas atmosphere under a pressure of 1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa.<br>
[0050]<br><br>
19 <br>
The reasons for setting the heating temperature in the range of 150 to l,100°C<br>
are as follows. When the temperature is lower than 150°C, it becomes necessary to adjust the pressure to lower than 1 x 10-12 MPa, which is not only difficult from an industrial viewpoint, but is also not effective. On the other hand, when the temperature is higher than 1,100°C, loss of Mg increases disadvantageously. Further, when the pressure exceeds 1 x 10-1 MPa, disadvantages are caused in that the coating efficiency of the Mg coating is lowered, and in that the thickness of the Mg coating formed becomes non-uniform. The heating temperature of the mixed powder of the soft magnetic metal powder and the Mg powder is more preferably in the range of 300 to 900°C, and the pressure is more preferably 1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa.<br>
[0051]<br>
Fig. 2 exemplifies various patterns of variation of temperature with time during heating of a soft magnetic metal powder which has been subjected to oxidation treatment, while optionally rumbling. Generally, heating is performed by maintaining at a constant temperature as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 2A. However, the heating may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 2B, in which the temperature is varied, or in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 2C, in which the temperature is elevated to a relatively low temperature and maintained, and then the temperature is elevated to a higher temperature and maintained, or in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. lD, in which the temperature is elevated to a relatively high temperature and maintained, and then the temperature is lowered to a lower temperature and maintained. Further, the heating may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. lE, in which the pattern indicated in Fig. 1A is repeated a plurality of times. Furthermore, the heating may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 1F, in which the temperature is<br><br>
20<br>
maintained at a high temperature, and then maintaining the temperature at a low<br>
temperature, and then maintaining the temperature at a high temperature again.<br>
[0052]<br>
In the method for producing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film according to the present invention, the patterns of variation of temperature with time during heating of a soft magnetic metal powder which has been subjected to oxidation treatment, while optionally tumbling, are not limited to those shown in Fig. 2, and may be changed freely within the range of 150 to 1100°C.<br>
[0053]<br>
Further, in another embodiment, a soft magnetic metal powder coated with an Mg-containing oxide film according to the present invention can be produced by adding and mixing a Mg powder with a soft magnetic metal powder to obtain a mixed powder, and heating the mixed powder at a temperature of 150 to l,100°C in an inert gas or vacuum atmosphere under a pressure of 1 x 10-12 to 1 x 10-1 MPa, while optionally tumbling, followed by heating in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of 50 to 400°C to effect oxidation treatment, thereby forming a Mg-containing oxide film on a surface of a soft magnetic metal powder. In this case, the oxidization treatment is not effective when the temperature is lower than 50°C. On the other hand, when the oxidization treatment is performed by maintaining in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature higher than 400°C, an unfavorable sintering occurs. The oxidizing atmosphere is preferably a dry oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
[0054]<br>
Fig. 3 exemplifies various patterns of variation of temperature with time during oxidation treatment of the above-mentioned mixed powder. Generally, this oxidation treatment is performed by heating in an oxidizing atmosphere in a manner as shown by<br><br>
21<br>
the pattern indicated in Fig. 3A. However, the oxidation treatment may also be<br>
performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 3B, in which the temperature is elevated to a relatively low temperature and maintained, and then the temperature is elevated to a higher temperature and maintained. Further, the oxidation treatment may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 3C, in which the temperature is elevated to a relatively high temperature and maintained, and then the temperature is lowered to a lower temperature and maintained. Furthermore, the oxidation treatment may also be performed in a manner as shown by the pattern indicated in Fig. 3D, in which the temperature is elevated and lowered without substantially being maintained. The patterns of variation of temperature with time during the oxidation treatment of the above-mentioned mixed powder are not limited to those shown in Fig. 3, and may be changed freely within the range of 50 to 400°C.<br>
[0055]<br>
By mixing the thus obtained soft magnetic metal powder which has been subjected to oxidation treatment under the above-mentioned conditions with a Mg powder to obtain a mixed powder, and heating the obtained mixed powder while tumbling, a Mg-containing oxide film is formed on a surface of the soft magnetic metal powder, thereby obtaining a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film. Sometimes, however, the Mg oxidation may be insufficient. For preventing such insufficiency of Mg oxidation, it is preferable to subject the obtained soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film to a further heating treatment at a temperature of 50 to 400°C. It is preferable that this heating be performed at a temperature of 50°C or higher, but when the temperature exceeds 400°C, an unfavorable sintering occurs. For this reason, the temperature is set in the range of 50 to 400°C.<br><br>
22 [0056]<br>
As the soft magnetic metal powder used as a raw material in the method for producing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film according to the present invention, those which are conventionally known may be used, such as an iron powder, insulated-iron powder, Fe-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Ni iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Cr iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Si iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Si-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Co iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, Fe-Co-V iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder, or Fe-P iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder. More specifically, the iron powder is preferably a pure iron powder, and the insulated-iron powder is preferably a phosphate-coated iron powder, or a silicon oxide-or aluminum oxide-coated iron powder which is obtained by adding and mixing a wet solution such as a silica sol-gel solution (silicate) or alumina sol-gel solution with an iron powder to coat the surface of the iron powder, followed by drying and sintering.<br>
[0057]<br>
The Fe-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably an Fe-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 0.1 to 20% of Al and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities (e.g., an Alperm powder having a composition including Fe-15%A1).<br>
[0058]<br>
The Fe-Ni iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably a nickel-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 35 to 85% of nickel, optionally at least one member selected from the group including not more than 5% of Mo, not more than 5% of Cu, not more than 2% of Cr, and not more than 0.5% of Mn, and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities. The Fe-Cr iron-based soft magnetic alloy<br><br>
23<br>
powder is preferably an Fe-Cr iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 1 to 20%<br>
of Cr, optionally at least one member selected from the group consisitng of not more than 5% of Al and not more than 5% of Ni, and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities.<br>
[0059]<br>
The Fe-Si iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably an Fe-Si iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 0.1 to 10% by weight of Si and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities. The Fe-Si-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably an Fe-Si-Al iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 0.1 to 10% by weight of Si, 0.1 to 20% of Al, and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities. The Fe-Co-V iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably an Fe-Co- V iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 0.1 to 52% of Co, 0.1 to 3% of V, and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities.<br>
[0060]<br>
The Fe-Co iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably an Fe-Co iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 0.1 to 52% of Co, and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities. The Fe-P iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder is preferably an Fe-P iron-based soft magnetic alloy powder including 0.5 to 1% of P, and the remainder containing Fe and inevitable impurities. (Hereinabove, "%" indicates "% by mass".)<br>
[0061]<br>
Further, the above-mentioned soft magnetic metal powder preferably has an average particle diameter in the range of 5 to 500 urn. The reason for this is as follows. When the average particle diameter is less than 5 µm, the compressibility of the powder is lowered, and the volume ratio of the soft magnetic metal powder becomes smaller,<br><br>
24<br>
thereby leading to lowering of the magnetic flux density value. On the other hand,<br>
when the average particle diameter is more than 500 urn, the eddy current generated in the soft magnetic powder increases, thereby lowering the magnetic permeability at high frequencies.<br>
[0062]<br>
For producing a composite soft magnetic material from a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method of the present invention, a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method of the present invention is subjected to powder compaction and sintering by a conventional method. More specifically, at least one member selected from the group including silicon oxide and aluminum oxide, each having an average particle diameter of not more than 0.5 µm, is added and mixed with the soft magnetic metal powder coated with an Mg-containing oxide film to obtain a mixed powder including 0.05 to 1% by mass of the at least one and the remainder containing the soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film, and the mixed powder is subjected to powder compaction and sintering by a conventional method.<br>
[0063]<br>
A soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method of the present invention has a Mg-containing oxide film formed on the surface of the soft magnetic powder. The Mg-containing oxide film reacts with silicon oxide and/or aluminum oxide to form a composite oxide, thereby enabling the production of a composite soft magnetic material having high resistivity and mechanical strength, wherein the high resistivity is due to the presence of the high-resistivity composite oxide between grain boundaries of the soft magnetic powder, and the high mechanical strength is attained by sintering through silicon oxide and/or aluminum oxide. In this case,<br><br>
25<br>
silicon oxide and/or aluminum oxide is mainly sintered, so that a low coercivity can be<br>
maintained, thereby enabling the production of a composite soft magnetic material with small hysteresis loss. The above-mentioned sintering is preferably performed in an inert gas or oxidizing gas atmosphere at a temperature of 400 to l,300°C.<br>
Further, a composite soft magnetic material may also be produced by adding and mixing a wet solution such as a silica sol-gel solution (silicate) or alumina sol-gel solution with a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film according to the present invention, followed by drying, subjecting the resulting dried mixture to compression molding, and sintering the resultant in an inert gas or oxidizing gas atmosphere at a temperature of 400 to l,300°C.<br>
[0064]<br>
In addition, a composite soft magnetic powder having improved properties with respect to resistivity and strength can be produced by mixing an organic insulating material, an inorganic insulating material, or a mixed material of an organic insulating material and an inorganic insulating material with a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method of the present invention. In this case, as the organic insulating material, an epoxy resin, fluorine resin, phenol resin, urethane resin, silicone resin, polyester resin, phenoxy resin, urea resin, isocyanate resin, acrylic resin, polyimide resin, or PPS resin, can be used. As the inorganic insulating material, a phosphate such as iron phosphate, various glass insulating materials, water glass containing sodium silicate as a main component, or insulative oxide can be used.<br>
[0065]<br>

26<br>
including boron oxide, vanadium oxide, bismuth oxide, antimony oxide and<br>
molybdenum oxide in an amount of 0.05 to 1% by mass, in terms of B2O3, V2O5, Bi2O3, Sb2O3, MOO3, followed by powder compaction, and sintering the resulting compacted powder article at a temperature of 500 to l,000°C, thereby obtaining a composite soft magnetic material. The thus obtained composite soft magnetic material has a composition including 0.05 to 1% by mass, in terms of B2O3, V2O5, Bi2O3, Sb2O3, MOO3, of at least one selected from the group including boron oxide, vanadium oxide, bismuth oxide, antimony oxide and molybdenum oxide, and the remainder containing a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method of the present invention. In this case, the Mg-containing oxide film formed on a surface of the soft magnetic metal powder reacts with at least one selected from the group including boron oxide, vanadium oxide, bismuth oxide, antimony oxide and molybdenum oxide to form a desired film.<br>

[0067]<br><br>
27<br>
A composite soft magnetic material obtained by using a soft magnetic metal<br>
powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film produced by the method of the present invention has high density, high strength, high resistivity and high magnetic flux density.

[0084]<br>
Separately from the above, a Mg powder having an average particle diameter of 30 µm and a Mg ferrite powder having an average particle diameter of 3 µm were prepared.<br>
Example 1 [0085]<br>
Present methods 1 to 7 and comparative methods 1 to 3 were performed as follows. To soft magnetic powder A (a pure iron powder), which had been subjected to<br><br>
32<br>
oxidation treatment under conditions as indicated in Table 1, was added a Mg powder in<br>
an amount as indicated in Table 1. Then, the resulting powder was subjected to tumbling in an argon gas or vacuum atmosphere while maintaining the pressure and temperature indicated in Table 1, thereby obtaining a soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film.<br>
[0086]<br>
The obtained soft magnetic metal powder coated with a Mg-containing oxide film was placed in a mold, and subjected to press molding to obtain a plate-shaped compacted powder article having a size of 55 mm (length) x 10 mm (width) x 5 mm (thickness) and a ring-shaped compacted powder article having an outer diameter of 35 mm, an inner diameter of 25 mm and a height of 5 mm. Then, the obtained compacted powder articles were sintered in a nitrogen atmosphere while maintaining the temperature as indicated in Table 1 for 30 minutes, thereby obtaining composite soft magnetic materials, which were a plate-shaped sintered article and a ring-shaped sintered article. With respect to the plate-shaped sintered articles obtained by present methods 1 to 7 and comparative methods 1 to 3, the relative density, resistivity and flexural strength were measured. The results are shown in Table 1. Further, coils were wound around the ring-shaped sintered articles obtained by present methods 1 to 7 and comparative methods 1 to 3, and the magnetic flux density was measured using a BH tracer. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><onventional example> [0087]<br>
Conventional method 1 was performed as follows. To the soft magnetic powder A prepared in the examples was added a Mg ferrite powder in an amount<br><br>
33<br>
indicated in Table 1, followed by stirring in air while tumbling, to thereby obtain a mixed<br>
