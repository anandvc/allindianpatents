COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
CATIONIC COPOLYMER AND STARCHES FORMULATED COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS EXHIBITING RADIANCE WITH SOFT FOCUS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
CATIONIC COPOLYMER AND STARCHES FORMULATED COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS EXHIBITING RADIANCE WITH SOFT FOCUS<br>
The invention relates to compositions for improving the appearance of skin, particularly to provide good coverage over imperfections such as pores and uneven skin tone, while retaining a natural skin appearance.<br>
A matte effect is desired for users of color cosmetics. The matte finish overcomes the shiny effect engendered by greasy skin, particularly under hot and humid conditions. Absorbent fillers such as talc, silica, kaolin and other inorganic particulates have been used to achieve the effect by their optical properties.<br>
Imperfect skin can be hidden in two ways through manipulation of light transmission. In the first, components of the color cosmetic may simply reflect light back toward the source. An alternative approach is referred to as achieving a soft focus effect. Here the incoming light is distorted by scattering (lensing). Components of the color cosmetic in this mechanism operate as lenses to bend and twist light into a variety of directions.<br>
While it is desirable to hide imperfect skin through a matte effect, there is also a desire to achieve a healthy skin radiance. A cosmetic covering that is too opaque hides the skin under a paint-like coating. Imperfections are hidden but there is no radiance. Where light transmission is insufficiently hindered, the opposite occurs. Here the glow may be healthy but aesthetically displeasing skin topography and color may now be apparent.<br>
US 5 997 890 (Sine et al.) US Patent 5 972 359 (Sine et al.) and US 6 174 533 B1 (SaNogueira, Jr.) are all directed to topical compositions to provide good coverage of skin imperfections. The solution proposed by these documents is the use of a metal oxide with a refractive index of at least 2 and a neat primary particle size of from 100 to 300 nm. Preferred particulates are titanium dioxide, zirconium oxide and zinc oxide.<br>
Silicone gelling agents such as crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomers because of their excellent skinfeel properties have been found useful in make-up compositions. For instance, US 5  266 321  (Shukuzaki  et al.) discloses  an oily  make-up composition<br><br>
-2-<br>
comprised of a silicone gel crosslinked elastomer, titanium dioxide, mica and iron oxides. Japanese patent application 61-194009 (Harashima) describes a make-up composition comprising a cured organopolysiioxane elastomer powder and pigments which may be selected from talc, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and iron oxides.<br>
A challenge which has not been fully met by the known art is delivery of a composition with appropriate optics to achieve both soft focus and radiance properties in a system that still provides excellent skinfeel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cosmetic composition is provided which includes:<br>
(i)     from 0.1 to 30% by weight of a starch;<br>
(ii)     from 0.1 to 20% by weight of a cationic copolymer having monomer units of<br>
acryloylethyl tri(C1-C3 alkyl) ammonium salt; and (iii)    a cosmetically acceptable carrier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been observed that a soft focus effect with radiance can be obtained by a combination of starch and a cationic copolymer wherein one of the monomer units is acryloylethyl tri(C1-C3 alkyl) ammonium salt.<br>

EXAMPLES 1 - 8<br>
Formulas suitable for the present invention are recorded in table I.<br>
EXAMPLES 9 -17<br>
A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate the radiance and soft focus effects of compositions according to the present invention. Table II outlines the composition of the formulas and performance results.<br>
Radiance in the form of a gloss measurement was evaluated on a Novogloss® Glossmeter. The Glossmeter geometry was first set with both detector and light source at 85° from normal. An appropriate reflection standard was used to calibrate the instrument. Gloss (radiance) is reported as the percent difference in before and after treatment measurements. The larger the value (or less negative), the better the radiance effect.<br>
A haze determination was utilized to evaluate soft focus effects. For this purpose, a Hunter Lab Spectracolorimeter was employed. This instrument had an optical geometry of 0° incidence and 45° reflectance (both for normal). Reflectance measurements gauge the soft focus effect from an opaque surface. These measurements are reported as a Haze value, it is the difference between an initial (zero) reading and a final one after treatment. Higher Haze values indicate a greater soft focus effect.<br>
Sample formula in 20 mg dosage was applied onto a human forearm, and let dry for 20 minutes. Treated forearms were then rinsed under water for 2 minutes, and let dry for another 20 minutes. Thereafter the treated areas were scanned on the Hunter Lab Spectracolori meter  and  also  on the Glossmeter.     Before and  after changes were<br><br>
- 12-<br>
recorded both for pre-rinse and post-rinse conditions to obtain the respective percent Gloss and Haze values.<br>
Example 9 is a control. No significant change over untreated surface is seen in radiance/Gloss or soft focus/Haze. Example 10 contained a starch component (Pure Gel B894® which is sodium hydroxypropyl starch phosphate) but no cationic copolymer. This formula exhibited good properties in dry state but upon rinsing lost both radiance and soft focus {-3.4 and 4.1, respectively). Moreover, this formula was sticky/tacky in feel.<br>
Examples 11, 12 and 13 were each formulated with a cationic copolymer but no starch.<br>
Merquat 5® is a trademark for acrylamide/methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
methylsulfate copolymer; Simulgel INS® is a trademark for hydroxyethylacrylate/sodium<br>
acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymer; and copolymer 7688 MP is a trademark for<br>
acrylamide/acryloylethyl	trimethylammonium<br>
chloride/tris(hydroxymethy[)acrylamidomethane copolymer. Examples 11, 12 and 13 exhibited an increased radiance but there was hardly any change in soft focus/haze.<br>
Examples 14 - 17 included both a cationic copolymer and a starch. Example 14 with Simulgel INS® as the copolymer exhibited the most loss in Haze (soft focus) after rinse. Merquat 5® in example 16 after rinse retained some residual Haze effect. Best performance was with examples 15 and 17 containing the inventive copolymer 7688 MP. These formulas maintained not only a good soft focus (Haze) effect under dry conditions but also experienced little loss of this property on rinsing.<br>
Based on the foregoing experiments, it is seen possible to improve radiance (Gloss) while maintaining soft focus (Haze) through use of starch in combination with an acryloylethyl trialkyl ammonium salt copolymer such as 7688 MP. Simulgel INS® had similar properties to 7688 MP except the former completely lacked substantivity against rinse-off, Merquat 5® suffered from poor film formation characteristics which hindered gloss enhancement as well as having lower substantivity relative to 7688 MP. From a sensory perspective, 7688 MP in combination with starch revealed a silky feel. By contrast, Merquat 5® and starch formulas felt tacky/sticky.<br><br>
