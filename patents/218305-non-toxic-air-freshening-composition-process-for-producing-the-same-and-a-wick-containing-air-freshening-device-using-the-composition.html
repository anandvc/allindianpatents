				<td>OF THE INVENTION<br>
Our invention relates  to  single phase  aqueous  surfactant-free  nontoxic  air<br><br>
freshening  compositions land wick-containing  air freshening  devices  using  such compositions.<br>
Conventional liquid air fresheners generally comprise a reservoir containing a<br><br>
mixture which may be a true solution, a colloidal solution or a microemulsion of a perfume with a solvent into which dips a wick which is connected to an emanating<br>
surface. The perfume mixture travels up the wick to the emanating surface from which<br>
the perfume evaporates and freshens the surrounding atmosphere.   Perfumes used in<br>
those air fresheners are  generally oils and are therefore generally insoluble in water in the absence of any other agents.   Systems in which the perfume solution is aqueous based<br>
therefore always contain 4 surface active agent which solubilizes the perfume in water.<br>
i<br>
The amount of surfactant has to be quite high, for instance, 10-15% or more by weight<br>
based on the total composition.<br>
The surfactants used in such compositions are conventional surfactants, generally anionic surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates and lauryl sulfates. Nonionic surfactants have also been used, but they are more expensive and tend to depress the perception of the perfume odor. These surface active agents are all nonvolatile, and they therefore do not evaporate from the emanating surface. The concentration of surfactant in the emanating surface  therefore gradually increases, and the presence of surfactant impedes the progress of performe  in the wick and also prevents the perfume emanating as it should.<br>
Most aqueous based systems also contain a cosolvent in addition to the perfume and surfactant. Examples of cosolvents are ethanol and diethylene glycol monoethyl<br><br>
ethers (DEGMEE).  Such compositions always contain a surfactant and therefore suffer the same disadvantages as described above.<br>
Some liquid air fresheners contain little or no water and so are free of surfactant. For example, a solution of perfume in DEGMEE having the structure:and water is stable as a single phase provided the amount of water is low, for example, below 20% when the amount of perfume is about 10% by weight. Since these compositions cannot tolerate high amounts of water, they tend to be expensive.<br>
U.S. Letters Patent! No. 3,945,950 (incorporated by reference herein) describes solid air freshener campositions, which suffer from different problems to the air fresheners comprising liquid compositions with which our invention is concerned. The solid compositions contain perfume, a diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether and a gelling agent, which is a surface active fatty acid soap or metal salt thereof and an inert liquid. Water is sometimes included in the compositions as some or all of the inert liquid, but only in small amounts of 4% by weight.<br>
In U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081 issued on May 5, 1987 (the specification for which is incorporated % reference herein), it is indicated that diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEGMBE) having the structure:<br>
can, when containing dissolved perfume, incorporate a surprisingly large amount of water compared to other glycol ethers and is therefore more cost effective. It is further indicated in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081 that the mixture of DEGMBE and water also has very suitable volatility properties and has a beneficial effect on the rate of emanation of the perfume. It is further indicated in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081 that the composition containing the DEGMBE generally comprises between 5 and 30% by weight of perfume; usually between 8 and 20% by weight of perfume and often 10% by weight. It is further indicated in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081 that the amounts of perfume in compositions containing DEGMBE affect the amount of water that can be mixed into the solution before a phase separation occurs. It is stated that, for example, when the concentration of  perfume in the solution is 10% by weight then the maximum amount of water that can be incorporated in a one phase solution is about 55% by weight, and for a perfume solution at 20% concentration, the maximum amount of water is about 40% by weight.<br>
It is further indicated in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081 that the perfume may be any of the perfumes conventionally used in air fresheners and that "the identity of the perfume makes little difference to the behavior of the solvent system. It is further indicated in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081:<br>
"Solutions of perfume in various glycoi ethers of varying concentration were loaded with water until phase separation occurred. The maximum amounts of water tolerated in systems at various perfume concentrations for the glycoi ethers tested is shown in Table 1.<br>
		TABLE 1	<br>
Maximum amount of water that can be incorporated into the perfume/glycol ether<br>
 mixtures, before phase separation.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 As can be seen from the table DEGMBE can tolerate a far larger amount of water at a specified perfume concentration than any of the other glycol ethers."<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
it has become apparent that a substitute for the system set forth in U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,663,081 is needed.       <br>
It is an object of our invention to provide such substitution means.<br>
PCT Application  No. 97/45516 published on December 4, 1997 discloses and claims a phase-stable liquid refreshment and cleaning composition comprising:<br>
(a)	butoxy propoxy propanol; or other alkoxylated alkoxy propanol solvent<br>
(defined according to one of the structures: (Figure Removed)<br>
(b)	water;       <br>

However, the PCT Application No. 97/45516 does not teach the problems solved by our invention.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Our invention is directed to a single phase aqueous surface-active agent-free air freshening composition characterized in that it is (a) nontoxic; (b) nonmutagenic; and (c) environmentally friendly, consisting essentially of:<br>
(i)      30-70 weight percent water;<br>
(ii) 5-20 weight percent of a fragrance composition wherein at least 60% of its composition coifsists of one or more substances having a C log10P 
(iii) 30-60 weight percent of a mixture of two glycol ether compounds, one of which is dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether having the structure:<br>
(Figure Removed) and the other of which is a compound defined according to the structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R is n-propyl or n-butyl.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for producing a synergistic single phase aqueous surface active agent-free air freshening composition characterized in that it is (a) nontoxic; (b) nonomutagenic; and (c) environmentally friendly, said process comprising mixing essentially the following ingredients:<br>
(i)       30-70 weight percent water;<br>
(ii)      5-20 weight percent of a fragrance composition wherein at least 60% of its   composition   consists   of  one   or   more   substances   having   a<br>
C log10 

(iii)     3O-60 weight percent of a mixture of two glycol ether compounds, one of which is the dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether having the structure;<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and the other of which is a compound defined according to the structure:<br>
 wherein R is n-propyl or n-butyl ([PnR]) and wherein the range of<br>
weight ratio of dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether: [PnR] is from about 1:1 up to about 5:1<br>
The composition of the present invention is a synergistic composition comprising<br>
		unexpected or surprising properties.<br>
The n-octanol/water partitioning coefficient of a perfume material indicated by the term "P" is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in n-octanol and in water. The perfume materials used in our invention have an n-octanol/water partitioning<br>
coefficieat "P" of between about 1 and about 10 '   with at least 60% of the perfume<br>
components having a partitioning coefficient of between about 1 and about 10 ' . Since the partitioning coefficients of the perfume compositions of this invention have values of between about 1 and about 107.5' , they are more conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, logloP. Thus, the perfume materials useful in the practice of our invention have a log10P of between about 1 and about 7.5 as indicated, supra,<br>
wherein 60% of the components of the perfume composition have a log10P of between about 1 and about 2.5 as indicated, supra.<br>
The log10P of many perfume ingredients have been reported; for example, the<br>
Pomona 92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, California, contains many, along with citations to the original<br>
literature. However, the log10P values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program, also available from Daylight CIS. This program also lists experimental log10P values when they are available in the Pomona 92 database. The<br>
"calculated log10P" is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo<br>
(Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 4, C. Hansch, P.O. Sammens, J.B. Taylor and C.A. Ramsden, Editors, page 295, Pergamon Press, 1990, incorporated by reference herein). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each component of the perfume material and  takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom<br>
connectivity and chemical bonding. The calculated log10P values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental log10P values in the selection of perfume materials useful in the practice of our invention.<br>
More specifically, the perfume materials useful in the practice of our invention having a C log10P

For the purposes of our invention, the compounds defined according to the structure:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R is n-propyl or 4-butyl, are shown by the symbol: [PnR].<br>
