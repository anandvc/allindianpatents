[See Section 10]<br>
"DIRECTLY       COMPRESSIBLE,       ULTRA       FINE       ACETAMINOPHEN COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SAME"<br>
RHODIA, INC., of 259 Prospect Plains Road, Cranbury, New Jersey 08512-7500, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain   the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
(  DfRECTbY COMPRESSIBLE; ULTRA FINE ACETAMINOPHEN    V    COMrOSITIONG AND PROCESS TOR PRODUCING SAME	)<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to directly compressible ultra-fine acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol or APAP) compositions and to a process for preparing such ultra-fine compressible granulated compositions. The invention also relates to the preparation of tablets from such compositions. The invention also includes such ultra-fine APAP granulations alone or combined with other pro-active ingredients present in low quantity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Generally there are four methods in use in the United States for manufacture of tablets, namely direct compression, dry powder blend, pre-compressed dry powder blend and wet granulation, as explained in US Patent 4 ,439,453.<br>
In the direct compression method, all the required tabletting ingredients (active and aids) are incorporated into a free flowing granulation which is supplied to the manufacturer of bulk tablets. The granulation requires no pre-processing or blending with additional aids in order to be tabletted. Rather, the free flowing granulation supplied to the tablet manufacturer can be charged directly to a tabletting press.<br>
The direct compression method is a generally preferred method for a number of reasons including economical reasons. The analgesic aspirin is generally tabletted using such a direct compression method since crystalline aspirin is soft and exhibits good plasticity/elasticity when compacted into tablets.<br>
However, because the analgesic acetaminophen has significantly different properties than aspirin, it is generally considered to be non-compressible and not readily amendable to production of directly compressible granulations thereof. Generally, the less desirable wet granulation method of tabletting has been used to tablet acetaminophen. Generally, these wet granulation processes require large amounts of<br>
2<br><br>
excipients, e.g., from about 25 to about 40% or more by weight of excipients. That is, in contrast to aspirin, the acetaminophen crystals are hard and brittle and are easily fractured. The acetaminophen crystals have essentially no plasticity/elasticity and, therefore, have required the use of unduly large amounts of aids, lubricants and/or excipients in order to be compressible into tablets by the direct compression method.<br>
Therefore, there is a recognized need for a direct tabletting granulated acetaminophen composition that is free flowing and capable of being directly compressible into tablets, A further need is for such a<br>
10     directly compressible acetaminophen granulation composition to provide a high load, for example, at least 80%, or preferably at least 90% or more, of acetaminophen active in the composition. Thus, the amount of excipients required in the compositions should be kept quite low, for example, 20% or less, preferably 10% by weight or less. In addition, the directly<br>
15     compressible acetaminophen composition should readily be free flowing and readily permit dry blending with other active ingredients should that be desired or required. A further need is that the directly compressible acetaminophen composition be such as to provide good flow and compressibility characteristics so as to produce tablets of content<br>
2p     uniformity, acceptable hardness and friability, and also provide a fluid bed granulation with a characteristic rough surface morphology and a high surface area suitable for good blending potential with other co-actives.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
2(5	This invention provides a directly compressible<br>
acetaminophen granulated composition. A directly compressible acetaminophen granulation composition of this invention and capable of being directly compressed into an acetaminophen tablet, comprises from about 80 to about 95 wt % acetaminophen, from about 1 to about 4 wt % 30     essentially water-insoluble tablet/capsule disintegrant, from about 0.5 to about 5.0 wt % polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone), from about 0,5 to about 5.0 wt % totally pre-gelatinized starch, about 0.25 to about 3.0 wt % of a fluidizing agent, and from about 0.25 to about 3.0 wt % of a lubricant, the<br>
3<br><br>
weignt percents being cased on the total weight of the dry components of the granulation composition, the granulation also comprising a moisture content of up to about 1.5 wt % based on the total weight of the dry components of granulation composition.<br>
5	The invention also comprises a process for producing such<br>
directly compressible acetaminophen granulation compositions. The process for the production of the directly compressible acetaminophen granulation compositions comprises: placing, as dry ingredients in a top spray fluid bed granulator, and dry blending with inert fluidization gas<br>
o)     acetaminophen powder, the water-insoluble tablet/capsule disintegrant, a minor proportion of the totally pregelatinized starch, and at least a portion, or optionally all, of the fluidizing agent; heating the dry blend with heated pressurized fluidization gas, such as heated air, to fluidize and essentially uniformly heat the dry blend to a temperature in the range of about 25°C to<br>
5     about 30°C; when the dry blend has reached the desired temperature, spraying a first binder solution of a major portion of the polyvinylpyrrolidone dissolved in water from an atomizing spray gun of the granulation onto the heated dry blend to commence granulation of the dry powder blend; drying the granulation until the granulated product rises to about 2°C above the<br>
o    end product temperature; spraying a second aqueous binder solution of the remaining minor portion of the polyvinylpyrrolidone, the remaining major portion of the totally pregelatinized starch, and optionally a lubricant, from an atomizing gun of the granulator onto the granulated product to further granulate and agglomerate the composition, and then drying this further<br>
5     granulated product until a moisture content of 1.5 wt % or less, preferably about 1.0 to 1.5 wt %, is achieved. The dried, directly compressible acetaminophen granulation composition, including APAP alone or in combination with other actives, is unloaded from the fluid bed granulator, and then can, if desired, be blended with other suitable dry ingredients in a<br>
     suitable blender, to provide the directly compressible acetaminophen compositions of this invention.<br>
The two spray process is necessary to effectively coat and agglomerate the ultra-fine particles to prepare fine particle sized granules<br><br>
t 4<br><br>
having a high surface area and characteristic rough surface myphology suitable for good blending potential, content uniformity, tablet hardness and dissolution.<br>
Detailed Description of Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
In the directly compressible composition of this invention, the ingredients thereof will generally be present in the following amounts expressed as percent by weight:<br>
acetaminophen: 80 to 95%, preferably 87.5 to 92.5%<br>
10	tablet/capsule disintegrant: 1 to 4%, preferably 1,5 to 3.5%<br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone: 0.5 to 5%, preferably 2.75 to 3.25%<br>
pregelatinized starch: 0,5 to 5%, preferably 2 to 4%<br>
fluidizing agent: 0.25 to 3%, preferably 0.25 to 1.25%<br>
lubricant: 0.25 to 3%, preferably 0.25 to 1.25%.<br>
1$	The acetaminophen particles of the product are such that<br>
preferably a maximum of 30 wt % is retained on a 60 US mesh screen, a<br>
maximum of 75 wt % is retained on a 100 US mesh screen, a maximum of<br>
95 wt % is retained on a 200 US mesh screen, and a minimum of 80 wt %<br>
is retained on a 325 US mesh screen.<br>
2(|)	The polyvinylpyrrolidone employed for its binding<br>
characteristics is preferably a lower molecular weight grade having an average molecular weight (Mw) of about 30,000 or less. As examples of grades of polyvinylpyrrolidone suitable for use in the invention, there can be mentioned povidone K30 or K29/32. Such polyvinylpyrrolidone impart a 25     low viscosity to the binder solutions. A major amount of the<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone is employed in the first binder solution as a particle coating agent, generally from about 80 to about 85 wt % of the total polyvinylpyrrolidone. The remaining minor amount of the polyvinylpyrrolidone, generally about 15 to 20 wt % of the total is employed 30     in the second binder or agglomerating solution with a major amount, generally preferably about 65 wt % of the pregelatinized starch.<br>
A minor portion of the pregelatinized starch, generally preferably about 35 wt % is used in the dry bowl charge to the fluid bed<br>
5<br><br>
granulator as an intra-granular disintegrant, as well as a dry binder. The pregelatinized starch employed is totally pregelatinized starch, such as for example National Starch and Chemicals Corp. pregelatinized starch products 1551.<br>
The total amount of the water-insoluble tablet/capsule disintegrant is used as a disintegrating agent in the dry bowl charge. The disintegrant is generally crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium carboxylmethyl starch (also known as sodium starch glycolate), microcrystalline cellulose, soy protein, alginic acid, crosslinked<br>
10     polyvinylpyrrolidone (also known as crosslinked povidone), and mixtures thereof, but is preferably crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose (croscarmeilosee sodium).<br>
Any suitable fluidizing agent may be employed in this invention, but preferably silicon dioxide is employed. This componentls—<br>
10     multifunctional and serves as a glidant, porosity reducer, granulation densifier and moisture scavenger, but primarily is employed as a fluidization aid during fluid bed granulation. Addition of the fluidizing agent to the initial dry charge to the fluid bed granulator helps the powders in the fluidized state for particle coating during the granulation process.<br>
20     Preferably at least about 50 wt % of the fluidizing agent is employed in the initial dry charge. Any remaining portion of the fluidizing agent not charged to the granulator in the dry charge can be blended with the product of the granulation process in a suitable blender to produce the final directly compressible composition.<br>
25	Any suitable lubricant can be employed as the process of this<br>
invention, such as for example, stearic acid or mixtures of fatty acids, hydrogenated vegetable oils, triglycerides of fatty acids, metal stearates or metal salts of fatty acid mixtures, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol, talc, and mixtures of lubricants, but preferably stearic acid is employed.<br>
30     The lubricant can be added to the second binder solution or added in a dry form to the product of the granulation process by blending therewith in a suitable blender.<br>
6<br><br>
In preparing the first binder solution, the major portion of polyvinylpyrrolidone is dispersed and dissolved in water and heated to a temperature of about 50°C to about 70°C, preferably to about 70°C, Heating of this binder solution before use in the granulation process 5     provides improved spreading efficiency for coating onto the powder particles of acetaminophen to achieve good compressibility of the final product. Co-actives can also be incorporated into this first binder solution to ensure good content uniformity of the low dose co-actives.<br>
In preparing the second binder solution, the remaining portions of polyvinylpyrrolidone and pregelatinized starch are dispersed in sufficient water and the solution heated to a temperature of from about 50°C to about 70°C, preferably to about 70°C, to insure total gelatinization of the starch granules, as well as producing efficient spreading of the second binder solution on the granulation. Optionally, low melting fatty acid mixtures, such as stearic acid or hudrogerated vegetable oils, can be dispersed within the second binder solution. During granulation with the second binder solution, the particles agglomerate while building up particle size. However, other process variables maintain the fine particle size of the granulation.<br>
The two-spray process of this invention is critical to effectively coat and agglomerate the particles, to prepare fine particle size granules having high surface area of from about 0.8 to about 1.0 m2/g and characteristic "rough surface" morphology suitable for good blending potential, content uniformity, tablet hardness and dissolution.<br>
Sufficient atomizing fluid (air) pressure is employed in the process to maintain a small droplet size for the binder solutions, and this in turn produces finer particle size in the resulting directly compressible granulated composition.<br>
High fluidization air volume is required during fluidization of 0     the powder. For example, in large scale manufacture of about 400 kg of granulated product, an air volume of between about 1800 to 3500 cfm is generally employed. Such large air volume keeps the particles sufficiently separated while permitting binder solution to spread on the. particles in a<br><br>
7<br><br>
way that keeps granule growth to a minimum, producing a finer particle size of the granulation. Preferably, a three-stage level in the air volume is employed in such a large scale manufacturing process. Initially a fluidization air volume of about 1800 cfm is employed. The air volume is 5     then increased to about 2500 cfm about midway through granulation with the first binder solution, and then increased to about 3500 cfm at the beginning of the granulation with the second binder solution. This stepwise increase in fluidization air volume keeps the particles being granulated in a highly fluidized state to produce finer particle size of the granulated product<br>
10     composition, and keeps the fluidized state of granulation substantially<br>
constant even though the granule density keeps increasing from commencement to termination of the granulation process. The fluidization air employed is air heated to a temperature of at least 40°C, preferably at least about 50°C, and will generally be heated to within the range of from 15     about 40°C to 80°C, depending upon other process conditions including relative humidity.<br>
Any suitable spray rate of binder solution may be employed in the process of this invention. In this previously mentioned large scale manufacturing process, a binder spray rate of from about 1700 to about<br>
2	0     2400 g/min, preferably from about 1900 to about 2100 g/min, is employed.<br>
By the process of this invention, a directly compressible acetaminophen composition can be provided that has a high loading of acetaminophen, preferably a load level of at least 90 wt % acetaminophen, and enables a tabletter to produce tablets with the same dose of<br>
25      acetaminophen in each tablet.<br>
The acetaminophen granulation produced by the process of this invention can be employed with low dose and other fine particle size active ingredients in tablets, such as for example, with psuedoephedrine hydrochloride, chloropheniramine maleate, dextromethorphan<br>
30     hydrobromide, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, propoxyphen napsylate, hydrocodone, codeine phosphate and the like. The acetaminophen granulation of this invention can be blended with such other active ingredients in a simple mixing process and achieve good content<br><br><br>
uniformity of the other active ingredients in any resulting tablets formed by direct compression of the resulting blend.<br>
The process of this invention can also incorporate other low dose co-active ingredients in the granulation charge, such as for example, those used in cough and cold medications and narcotic analgesic medications, used in amounts of up to about 10% by weight, generally from about 5 to about 10%. Co-actives of cough and cold remedies for analgesic, decongestant, antihistamine, cough suppressant combinations can include, for example, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, chlorpheniramine maleate, and the like. Co-active narcotic analgesic medications can include, for example, propoxyphen napsylate, hydrocodone, codeine phosphate and the like. These co-actives can be incorporated in the granulation compositions produced by the process of this invention or can be blended with the resulting fine particle size granulation produced according to the process of this invention and achieve directly compressible granulation product having good content uniformity of the active ingredients.<br>
The invention is illustrated, but not limited by, the following examples.<br>
