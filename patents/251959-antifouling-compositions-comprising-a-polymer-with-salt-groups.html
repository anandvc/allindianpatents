				<td>This invention relates to antifouling paint, especially for marine applications.<br>
Man-made structures such as boat hulls, buoys, drilling platforms, oil production rigs,<br>
and pipes which are immersed in water are prone to fouling by aquatic organisms such as<br>
green and brown algae, barnacles, mussels, and the like.<br>
Such structures are commonly of metal, but may also comprise other structural materials<br>
such as concrete. This fouling is a nuisance on boat hulls, because it increases frictional<br>
resistance during movement through the water, the consequence being reduced speeds<br>
and increased fuel costs. It is a nuisance on static structures such as the legs of drilling<br>
platforms and oil production rigs, firstly because the resistance of thick layers of fouling<br>
to waves and currents can cause unpredictable and potentially dangerous stresses in the<br>
structure, and secondly because fouling makes it difficult to inspect the structure for<br>
defects such as stress cracking and corrosion. It is a nuisance in pipes such as cooling<br>
water intakes and outlets, because the effective cross-sectional area is reduced by fouling,<br>
with the consequence that flow rates are reduced.<br>
It is known to use antifouling paint, for instance as a top coat on ships'hulls, to inhibit the<br>
settlement and growth of marine organisms such as barnacles and algae, generally by<br>
release of a biocide for the marine organisms.<br>
Traditionally, antifouling paints have comprised a relatively inert binder with a biocidal<br>
pigment that is leached from the paint. Among the binders which have been used are<br>
vinyl resins and rosin. Vinyl resins are seawater-insoluble and paints based on them use a<br>
high pigment concentration so as to have contact between the pigment particles to ensure<br>
leaching. Rosin is a hard brittle resin that is very slightly soluble in seawater. Rosin-based<br>
antifouling paints have been referred to as soluble matrix or eroding paints. The biocidal<br>
pigment is very gradually leached out of the matrix of rosin binder in use, leaving a<br>
skeletal<br><br>
matrix of rosin, which is washed off the hull surface to allow leaching of the<br>
biocidal pigment from deep within the paint film.<br>
Many successful antifouling paints in recent years have been "self-polishing<br>
copolymer" paints based on a polymeric binder to which biocidal tri-organotin<br>
moieties are chemically bound and from which the biocidal moieties are<br>
gradually hydrolysed by seawater. In such binder systems, the side groups of a<br>
linear polymer unit are split off in a first step by reaction with seawater, the<br>
polymer framework that remains becoming water-soluble or water-dispersible<br>
as a result. In a second step, the water-soluble or water-dispersible framework<br>
at the surface of the paint layer on the ship is washed out or eroded. Such paint<br>
systems are described for example in GB-A-1 457 590.<br>
As the use of tri-organotin has been prohibited world-wide, there is a need for<br>
alternative antifouling substances that can be used in antifouling compositions.<br>
Self-polishing copolymer paints which release non-biocidal moieties are<br>
described in EP-A-69 559, EP-A-204 456, EP-A-529 693, EP-A-779 304, WO-<br>
A-91/14743, WO-A-91/09915, GB-A-231 070, and JP-A-9-286933.<br>
US-A-4,675,051 describes a marine antifouling paint which is gradually<br>
dissolved in seawater and which comprises a binder in the form of a resin<br>
produced by the reaction of rosin and an aliphatic polyamine containing at least<br>
one primary or secondary amine group. EP-A-802 243 describes a coating<br>
composition comprising a rosin compound7 a polymer containing organosilyl<br>
ester groups, and an antifoulanl<br>
WO-A-02/02698 describes an antifouling paint which is gradually dissolved in<br>
seawater. The paint comprises a binder and an ingredient having marine<br>
biocide properties. The binder comprises a rosin material and an auxiliary film-<br>
forming resin. The auxiliary film-forming resin comprises a non-hydrolysing,<br>
water-insoluble film-forming polymer and an acid-functional film-forming<br>
polymer the acid groups of which are blocked by quaternary ammonium groups<br><br>
or quaternary phosphonium groups. In a first step, the blocking groups are<br>
hydrolysed, dissociated or exchanged with seawater species, the polymer<br>
framework that remains becoming soluble or dispersible in seawater as a result.<br>
In a second step, the soluble or dispersible framework at the surface of the<br>
paint layer on the ship is washed out or eroded.<br>
The structure of the quaternary ammonium groups or quaternary phosphonium<br>
groups that are used as blocking groups on the acid-functional polymer<br>
influences the rate at which the paint dissolves or erodes. Although longer-chain<br>
quaternary ammonium groups ensure a slow degradation of the paint, these<br>
groups are more toxic with increasing size. This toxicity is for instance used in<br>
the mildew-proofing coating composition described in JP-A-2-120372.<br>
GB-A-2 273 934 describes a binder system that is an alternative to organotin-<br>
based antifouling systems. One of the hydrolysable polymeric binders described<br>
comprises halide-amine salt-comprising groups bound to a polymeric backbone.<br>
Such a polymeric binder is prepared by copolymerisation of halide-amine salt<br>
monomers that comprise a (meth)acrylamide functionality. These polymeric<br>
binders are partially soluble in seawater due to the halide-amine salt groups.<br>
However, as the whole binder is to some extent seawater-soluble from the start,<br>
the paint erodes relatively quickly.<br>
JP-A-07 082511 describes another binder system that is an alternative to<br>
organotin-based antifouling systems. One of the hydrolysable polymeric binders<br>
described comprises phosphonium salt groups bound to a polymeric backbone.<br>
The counter-ion of the phosphonium ion is a small group, for instance a halogen<br>
ion, the residue of formic acid, acetic acid or oxalic acid, a sulphate ion, or a<br>
phosphoric acid ion. These polymeric binders are partially soluble in seawater<br>
due to the small phosphonium salt groups. However, as the whole binder is to<br>
some extent seawater-soluble from the start, the paint erodes relatively quickly.<br>
Salt group-comprising binders as described above are alternatives for tin<br>
systems, but the erosion rate of those systems is relatively high. Consequently,<br><br>
there is a need for a salt group-comprising binder polymer which is relatively<br>
poorly soluble in seawater from the start, while the counter-ions are<br>
hydrolysable, separable or exchangeable with seawater species, the polymer<br>
framework that remains becoming soluble or dispersible in seawater as a result.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of a polymer which provides a solution<br>
to the above-mentioned problems/disadvantages in antifouling compositions, to<br>
antifouling compositions comprising the polymer, and to the use of such<br>
antifouling compositions for the protection of man-made structures immersed in<br>
water such as boat hulls, buoys, drilling platforms, oil production rigs, and pipes.<br>
The binder polymer used in the present invention is a polymer comprising one<br>
or more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-<br>
functional groups that are bound (pendant) to the backbone of the polymer, said<br>
salt comprising as counter-ion the anionic residue of an acid having an aliphatic,<br>
aromatic, or alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising at least 5, preferably at least<br>
6 carbon atoms. Said binder polymer comprises one or more salts of amine-<br>
functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-functional groups<br>
bound to the backbone of the polymer consisting of or comprising a group of<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
wherein<br>
Y is O or NH, Z is N or P, R1 is a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl group,<br>
preferably hydrogen or a C1-C2 alkyl group.<br>
R2 is a C2-C12 divalent hydrocarbon group, preferably a C2-C8 divalent<br>
hydrocarbon group, more preferably a C2-C4 divalent hydrocarbon group.<br><br>
R3 and R4 independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group,<br>
preferably a C1-C6 alkyl group, more preferably a methyl, or an optionally<br>
substituted phenyl group.<br>
X is the anionic residue of an acid having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryl<br>
hydrocarbon group comprising at least 5, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Hence, the polymer comprises a salt of a primary and/or secondary and/or<br>
tertiary amine and/or a salt of a primary and/or secondary and/or tertiary<br>
phosphine. Such polymers are described for example in JP 63-273609. This<br>
Japanese document describes the use of such polymers as coagulation<br>
treatment agents for waste water containing a large amount of organic<br>
materials.<br>
A process for preparing a salt group-comprising polymer as used in the present<br>
invention may comprise the steps of.<br>
- Reacting a long-chain acid with an amine- or phosphine-functional monomer<br>
of formula (II):<br><br>
wherein<br>
Y is 0 or NH, Z is N or P, R1 is a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl group,<br>
preferably hydrogen or a C1-C2 alkyl group.<br>
R2 is a C2-C12 divalent hydrocarbon group, preferably a C2-C8 divalent<br>
hydrocarbon group, more preferably a C2-C4 divalent hydrocarbon group.<br>
R3 and R4 independently represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-C6 alkyl<br>
group, preferably methyl, or an optionally substituted phenyl group.<br>
This reaction results in a monomer comprising a salt of an amine-functional<br>
group and/or a salt of a phosphine-functional group, said salt comprising as<br>
counter-ion the anionic residue of an acid having an aliphatic, aromatic, or<br><br>
alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising at least 5, preferably at least 6 carbon<br>
atoms (see formula (I) above). Quaternary ammonium or quaternary<br>
phosphonium groups are not formed by this reaction.<br>
- Polymerisation of at least one type of salt-comprising monomer, which<br>
monomer comprises a salt of an amine-functional group and/or a salt of a<br>
phosphine-functional group according to formula (I) as defined above.<br>
An acid having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising<br>
5 or more, preferably 6 or more carbon atoms can be used as long-chain acid in<br>
the first-mentioned process step. For example, the acid may be a carbonic acid,<br>
a sulphonic acid, or a sulphate acid. Preferably, the acid comprises 5 or more,<br>
more preferably 6 or more carbon atoms, even more preferably 8 or more<br>
carbon atoms. The acids can be branched. The acids may comprise cyclic<br>
groups. Suitable acids are, for example, palmitic acid, steric acid, ethyl hexanoic<br>
acid, rosin, and acid-functional rosinate derivatives. The acid preferably<br>
comprises up to 50 carbon atoms, more preferably up to 30 carbon atoms, even<br>
more preferably up to 20 carbon atoms, and most preferably 16 carbon atoms.<br>
Optionally, the acid is an acid-functional compound having marine biocidal<br>
properties, such as (9E)-4-(6,10-dimethyIocta-9,11-dienyl) furan-2-carboxylic<br>
acid or p-(sulpho-oxy) cinnamic acid (zosteric acid).<br>
The polymerisation of the salt-comprising monomer, or of a mixture of salt-<br>
comprising monomers, can be performed using a variety of co-monomers,<br>
optionally mixtures of co-monomers. For example, addition copolymerisation<br>
can be performed with an unsaturated monomer prepared by reacting an ester<br>
or amide of an alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, carbocylic or heterocyclic alcohol or amine<br>
with an unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as methyl acrylate or methacrylate,<br>
butyl acrylate or methacrylate, isobutylacrylate or methacrylate, and isobornyl<br>
acrylate or methacrylate. Alternatively, the unsaturated co-monomer can be a<br>
vinylic compound, for example styrene, vinyl pyrrolidone or vinyl acetate.<br><br>
The polymerisation of the salt-comprising monomer can be performed using a<br>
long-chain, acid-capped quaternary ammonium-functional monomer and/or a<br>
long-chain, acid-capped quaternary phosphonium-functional monomer. Such<br>
monomers and the polymerisation thereof are described in WO 2004/018533.<br>
The quaternary ammonium-functional and/or quaternary phosphonium-<br>
functional group of such monomer is 'long-chain, acid-capped', i.e. it is<br>
neutralised by a counter ion that consists of the anionic residue of an acid<br>
having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising 6 or<br>
more carbon atoms. The resulting polymer then comprises a salt of a primary<br>
and/or secondary and/or tertiary amine and/or a salt of a primary and/or<br>
secondary and/or tertiary phosphine and it is quaternary ammonium- and/or<br>
quaternary phosphonium-functional. Such a system can be referred to as a<br>
mixed system.<br>
The polymerisation of salt-comprising monomers preferably is performed using<br>
at least 5 mole% salt-comprising monomers, more preferably at least 10<br>
mole%. The polymerisation is preferably performed using less than 40 mole%<br>
salt-comprising monomers, more preferably less than 30 mole%. In case the<br>
polymerisation is performed using salt-comprising monomers as well as<br>
quaternary functional monomers, the total amount of salt-comprising monomers<br>
plus quaternary functional monomers preferably is at least 5 mole%, more<br>
preferably at least 10 mole%, and preferably less than 40 mole%, more<br>
preferably less than 30 mole%.<br>
The present invention relates to the use in antifouling coating compositions of a<br>
polymer comprising one or more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or<br>
more salts of phosphine-functional groups bound (pendant) to the backbone of<br>
the polymer, said salt comprising as counter-ion the anionic residue of an acid<br>
having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising at least<br>
5, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms. Said binder polymer comprises one or<br>
more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-<br><br>
functional groups bound to the backbone of the polymer consisting of or<br>
comprising a group of formula (I) as defined above.<br>
Preferably, a polymer comprising one or more salts of amine-functional groups<br>
and/or one or more salts of phosphine-functional groups bound (pendant) to the<br>
backbone of the polymer is used that has been built of at least 5 mole% salt-<br>
comprising monomers, calculated on the total amount of monomers of which<br>
the polymer has been built. More preferably, the polymer comprises at least 10<br>
mole% salt-comprising monomer building blocks. Preferably a polymer is used<br>
that comprises less than 40 mole% salt-comprising monomer building blocks,<br>
more preferably less than 30 mole%.<br>
Also preferred is the use of a polymer comprising one or more salt-comprising<br>
monomer building blocks and one or more quaternary-functional monomer<br>
building blocks of which the total amount of salt-comprising monomer building<br>
blocks plus quaternary functional monomer building blocks is at least 5 mole%,<br>
more preferably at least 10 mole%, and preferably less than 40 mole%, more<br>
preferably less than 30 mole%<br>
Also preferred is the use of a mixture of polymers comprising one or more salts<br>
of amine-functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-functional<br>
groups and optionally polymers comprising one or more quaternary ammonium-<br>
and/or quaternary phosphonium-functional groups bound (pendant) to the<br>
backbones of the polymers. Said mixture preferably comprises at least 5 mole%<br>
salt-comprising plus (the optionally present) quaternary functional monomer<br>
building blocks, calculated on the total amount of monomers of which the<br>
polymers in the mixture have been built. More preferably the mixture comprises<br>
at least 10 mole% salt-comprising plus quaternary functional monomer building<br>
blocks. Preferably a mixture of polymers is used that comprises less than 40<br>
mo!e% salt-comprising plus quaternary functional monomer building blocks,<br>
more preferably less than 30 mole%.<br><br>
The present invention further relates to antifouling coating compositions<br>
comprising a polymer comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts<br>
of phosphine-functional groups bound (pendant) to the backbone of the<br>
polymer, said salt comprising as counter-ion the anionic residue of an acid<br>
having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising at least<br>
5, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms. Said binder polymer comprises one or<br>
more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-<br>
functional groups bound to the backbone of the polymer consisting of or<br>
comprising a group of formula (I) as defined above.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition comprises a polymer comprising one or<br>
more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-<br>
functional groups bound (pendant) to the backbone of the polymer, that<br>
comprises at least 5 mole% salt-comprising monomer building blocks, more<br>
preferably at least 10 mole%. Preferably, the coating composition comprises a<br>
polymer that comprises less than 40 mole% salt-comprising monomer building<br>
blocks, more preferably less than 30 mole%.<br>
Also preferred is a coating composition comprising a polymer comprising one or<br>
more salt-comprising monomer building blocks and one or more quaternary-<br>
functional monomer building blocks of which the total amount of salt-comprising<br>
monomer building blocks plus quaternary functional monomer building blocks is<br>
at least 5 mole%, more preferably at least 10 mole%, and preferably less than<br>
40 mole%, more preferably less than 30 mole%<br>
Also preferred is a coating composition comprising a mixture of polymers<br>
comprising one or more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more<br>
salts of phosphine-functional groups and optionally polymers comprising one or<br>
more quaternary ammonium- and/or quaternary phosphonium-functional groups<br>
bound (pendant) to the backbone of the polymer, said mixture comprising at<br>
least 5 mole% salt-comprising plus (the optionally present) quaternary<br>
functional monomer building blocks, more preferably at least 10 mo!e%.<br><br>
Preferably, the coating composition comprises a mixture of polymers that<br>
comprises less than 40 mole% salt-comprising plus quaternary functional<br>
monomer building blocks, more preferably less than 30 mole%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the counter-ions of the salts in the polymer that<br>
comprises one or more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more<br>
salts of phosphine-functional groups are, on average, of low toxicity or even<br>
non-biocidal. In that case, an antifouling coating composition according to the<br>
present invention should comprise a separate ingredient having marine biocidal<br>
properties.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the salts in the polymer that comprises one or<br>
more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or more salts of phosphine-<br>
functional groups comprise as counter ion an ingredient having marine biocidal<br>
properties. In that case, an antifouling coating composition according to the<br>
present invention may comprise a separate ingredient having marine bicodal<br>
properties as co-biocide. An advantage of the incorporation of a biocide into the<br>
salt groups of the polymer is that the release rate of the built-in biocide depends<br>
on the ion exchange rate, which is more controllable than a release rate<br>
depending on diffusion rates. The acid-functional biocide used as counter-ion<br>
can be a natural or a synthesised compound and may be derived from natural<br>
products. For example, the acid-functional biocide used as counter-ion can be a<br>
material derived from a marine organism. Preferably, the biocide is readily<br>
degradable in the marine environment.<br>
The polymer framework, i.e. the binder, that dissolves in seawater or becomes<br>
dispersed in seawater (after or during hydrolysation, separation or exchange<br>
with seawater species of the counter-ions) preferably is of low toxicity, most<br>
preferably non-biocidal.<br>
The rate at which a cured coating prepared from an antifouling coating<br>
composition according to the current invention dissolves or erodes in seawater<br><br>
can be adjusted by the structure of the long-chain acid residue counter-ion<br>
groups, substantially without problems related to the toxicity of the released<br>
groups. A long-chain acid residue counter-ion group may for instance comprise<br>
a long chain, and/or it may be branched, and/or it may comprise cyclic groups.<br>
By changing the hydrophobicity of the long-chain acid residue counter-ion<br>
groups the rate at which the coating dissolves or erodes in seawater can be<br>
adjusted. Also the actual amount of the salt monomers used to prepare the<br>
polymer comprising one or more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or<br>
more salts of phosphine-functional groups can be used to adjust the rate at<br>
which the coating dissolves or erodes in seawater. Preferably, the counter-ion<br>
groups comprise anionic residues of one or more acids having an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon group comprising 5 to 50 carbon atoms, more preferably 6 to 50<br>
carbon atoms, even more preferably 6 to 20 carbon atoms. The counter-ion<br>
can, for example, be comprised of the anionic residue of rosin or other rosinate<br>
derived materials.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the antifouling composition<br>
according to the current invention comprises a rosin material as binder material<br>
in addition to the polymer comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or<br>
salts of phosphine-functional groups bound (pendant) to the backbone of the<br>
polymer, said salt comprising as counter-ion the anionic residue of an acid<br>
having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryl hydrocarbon group comprising at least<br>
5, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms. Said salt group-comprising binder<br>
polymer comprises one or more salts of amine-functional groups and/or one or<br>
more salts of phosphine-functional groups bound to the backbone of the<br>
polymer consisting of or comprising a group of formula (I) as defined above.<br>
Rosin is not a very good film former, and it is known to add other film-forming<br>
resins to rosin-based antifouling paints. Consequently, an antifouling coating<br>
composition according to the present invention comprising a rosin material as<br>
binder material (optionally, rosin may also be present as counter-ion in the<br>
polymer comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts of phosphine-<br>
functional groups) preferably will additionally comprise a non-hydrolysing,<br><br>
water-insoluble film-forming polymer. The ratio of the rosin binder material to<br>
the polymer comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts of<br>
phosphine-functional groups and optionally one or more other film-forming<br>
resins influences the strength of the paint film and/or the reliable eroding of the<br>
rosin-based paint matrix.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antifouling paint has<br>
a binder comprising a blend of a rosin material and an auxiliary film-forming<br>
resin in a weight ratio of 20:80 to 95:5, the auxiliary film-forming resin<br>
comprising 20-100% by weight of a film-forming polymer (A), which is the salt<br>
group-comprising polymer having salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts<br>
of phosphine-functional groups bound (pendant) to the backbone of the<br>
polymer, said salts comprising as counter-ion the anionic residue of an add<br>
having an aliphatic, aromatic, or alkaryi hydrocarbon group comprising at least<br>
5, preferably at least 6 carbon atoms, and up to 80% of a non-hydrolysing, water-<br>
insoluble film-forming polymer (B).<br>
The rosin material which can be added as binder material to a composition<br>
comprising the polymer comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts<br>
of phosphine-functional groups preferably is rosin, more particularly wood rosin<br>
or alternatively tall rosin or gum rosin. The main chemical constituent of rosin is<br>
abietic acid. The rosin can be any of the grades sold commercially, preferably<br>
that sold as WW (water white) rosin. The rosin material can alternatively be a<br>
rosin derivative, for example a maleinised or fumarised rosin, hydrogenated<br>
rosin, formylated rosin or polymerised rosin, or a rosin metal salt such as<br>
calcium, magnesium, copper or zinc rosinate.<br>
The non-hydrolysing, water-insoluble film-forming polymer (B) can for example<br>
be a vinyl ether polymer, such as a polyvinyl alkyl ether) or a copolymer of a<br>
vinyl alkyl ether with vinyl acetate or vinyl chloride, an acryiate ester polymer<br>
such as a homopolymer or copolymer of one or more alkyl acrylates or<br>
methacrylates which preferably contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl group<br><br>
and may contain a co-monomer such as acrylonitrile or styrene, or a vinyl<br>
acetate polymer such as polyvinyl acetate or' a vinyl acetate vinyl chloride<br>
copolymer. Polymer (B) can alternatively be a polyamine, particularly a<br>
polyamide having a plasticising effect such as a polyamide of a fatty acid dimer<br>
or the polyamide sold under the Trademark "Santiciser".<br>
We have found that the paints of the invention have the optimum combination of<br>
film-forming and eroding properties when the non-hydrolysing, water-insoluble<br>
film-forming polymer (B) is present in the composition. Most preferably, the<br>
weight ratio of rosin to total auxiliary film-forming resin is from 25:75, 50:50 or<br>
55:45 up to 80:20. The hydrolysing or dissociating film-forming polymer (A)<br>
preferably forms at least 30, most preferably at least 50, up to 80 or 90% by<br>
weight of the auxiliary film-forming resin, the non-hydrolysing water-insoluble<br>
polymer (B) being the remainder.<br>
The rosin and the polymers forming the auxiliary film-forming resin can be<br>
mixed in a common solvent which forms at least part of the paint solvent, for<br>
example, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as xylene, toluene or trimethyl-<br>
benzene, an alcohol such as n-butanol, an ether alcohol such as butoxyethanol<br>
or methoxypropanol, an ester such as butyl acetate or isoamyl acetate, an<br>
ether-ester such as ethoxyethyl acetate or methoxypropyl acetate, a ketone<br>
such as methyl isobutyl ketone or methyl isoarnyl ketone, an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon such as white spirit, or a mixture of two or more of these solvents.<br>
An antifouling paint according to the present invention, either with or without<br>
rosin, can include a non-polymeric plasticiser. Such a plasticiser can for<br>
example be present at up to 50% by weight based on the total binder polymer,<br>
most preferably at least 10% and up to 35% by weight based on the binder<br>
polymer. Examples of such plasticisers are phthalate esters such as dibutyl<br>
phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate, phosphate triesters such<br>
as tricresyl or tris(isopropyl)phenyl phosphate, or chlorinated paraffins.<br><br>
An ingredient having marine biocidal properties usually is a biocide for aquatic<br>
organisms or a pigment, or a mixture thereof. This biocide and/or pigment can<br>
be mixed with the binder using conventional paint-blending techniques. When<br>
the ingredient having marine biocidal properties is a pigment, it can be all or<br>
part of the pigment of the paint. The coating composition preferably has a<br>
pigment volume concentration of, for example, 15 to 55%.<br>
When the ingredient having marine biocidal properties is a pigment, the pigment<br>
can comprise a metalliferous pigment, for example a metalliferous pigment<br>
having a solubility in seawater of from 0.5 to 10 parts per million by weight.<br>
Examples of such pigments which also behave as aquatic biocides include<br>
copper or zinc compounds, such as cuprous oxide, cuprous thiocyanate,<br>
cuprous sulphate, zinc ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate), zinc dimethyl dithio-<br>
carbamate, zinc pyrithione, copper pyrithione, zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate,<br>
copper rosinate or cuprous ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate). Other sparingly<br>
soluble pigments having a solubility in seawater of 0.5 to 10 parts per million<br>
include barium sulphate, calcium sulphate, doiomite, and zinc oxide. Mixtures of<br>
sparingly soluble pigments can be used: for example, cuprous oxide, cuprous<br>
thiocyanate or zinc ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate), which are highly effective<br>
biocidal pigments, can be mixed with zinc oxide, which is not effective as a<br>
biocide but dissolves slightly more rapidly in seawater. Copper metal can be<br>
present as an aquatic biocide, for example in the flake or powder form.<br>
The antifouling coating composition can contain a non-metalliferous biocide for<br>
marine organisms, i.e. an ingredient having marine biocidal properties that is a<br>
biocide but not a pigment. Examples of such compounds are tetramethyl<br>
thiuram disulphide, methylene bis(thiocyanate), captan, pyridine triphenylboron,<br>
a substituted isothiazolone such as 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one,<br>
2-methylthio-4-t.butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine,<br>
N-3,4-dich!orophenyl-N',N'-dimethyl-urea("Diuron"),<br>
2-(thio-cyanomethylthio)benzothiazole,	2,4,5,6-tetrachloro-isophthalonitriIe,<br>
dichlorofluanide, tolylfluanide, 2-(p-chlorophenyl)-3-cyano-4-bromo-5-trifIuoro-<br><br>
methyl pyrrole, 3-benzo(b)thien-2-yl-5,6-dihydro-1,4,2-oxathiazine 4-oxide, 3-<br>
butyl-5-(dibromomethylidene)-2(5H)-furanone, and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-<br>
(methyl-sulphonyl)pyridine, 5-methyl-2-(1 -methylethyl)-cyclohexanol (L-<br>
menthol), mentholpropyleneglycol-carbonate. Such a non-metalliferous biocide<br>
can be used as the only biocide of the coating in a copper-free, or even metal-<br>
free or pigment-free antifouling coating.<br>
Optionally, the antifouling composition comprises one or more acid-functional<br>
biocides, for example (9E)-4-(6,10-dimethylocta-9,11-dienyl) furan-2-carboxylic<br>
acid and p-(sulpho-oxy) cinnamic acid (zosteric acid). Such a (mixture of) non-<br>
metalliferous acid-functional biocide(s) can be used as the only biocide of the<br>
coating in a copper-free, or even metal-free or pigment-free antifouling coating.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, an acid-functional biocide can be incorporated into<br>
the polymer comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts of<br>
phosphine-functional groups, i.e., one or more of the counter-ions in the<br>
polymer can be the anionic residue of an acid-functional biocide. In cases<br>
where enough acid-functional biocide is incorporated into the polymer<br>
comprising salts of amine-functional groups and/or salts of phosphine-functional<br>
groups, a separate ingredient having biocidal properties is not required.<br>
In addition to an ingredient having marine biocidal properties, which usually is a<br>
biocide for aquatic organisms or a pigment or a mixture thereof, or a biocide<br>
incorporated into the polymer, the coating composition can contain (other)<br>
pigments. For instance, pigments which are not reactive with seawater and may<br>
be highly insoluble in seawater (solubility below 0.5 part per million by weight),<br>
such as titanium dioxide or ferric oxide or an organic pigment such as<br>
phthalocyanine or azo pigment. Such highly insoluble pigments are preferably<br>
used at less than 60% by weight of the total pigment component of the paint,<br>
most preferably less than 40%.<br><br>
The coating composition can additionally contain other additives, for instance<br>
conventional thickeners, particularly thixotropes such as silica or bentonite<br>
and/or stabilisers, for example zeolites or aliphatic or aromatic amines such as<br>
dehydroabietylamine.<br>
The invention will be elucidated with reference to the following examples. These<br>
are intended to illustrate the invention but are not to be construed as limiting in<br>
any manner the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1 (palmitate capped monomer preparation)<br>
To obtain N-[3-(dimethylammonium)propyl]methacrylamide palmitate salt, N-[3-<br>
(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide was reacted with palmitic acid in the<br>
following way.<br>
N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyI]methacrylamide (20 g, 0.1175 moles) was dissolved<br>
in methanol (400 mL) and placed in a 1L three-necked round bottom flask. To<br>
this stirring solution solid palmitic acid (30.13 g, 0.1175 moles) was added,<br>
using a powder funnel and under a constant N2 purge. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature overnight.<br>
The colourless liquid was filtered to remove any residual particulate and the<br>
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resultant viscous liquid was<br>
analysed by 1H nmr and used without further purification.<br>
The above-described experiment was performed under the conditions routinely<br>
employed for this reaction. Variations on these reaction conditions are possible.<br>
For example, alternative solvents such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol,<br>
butanol, or blends of these with xylene can be employed to yield a monomer<br>
solution which can be carried forward directly (without isolation) to the<br>
polymerisation step. In addition, the reaction can be carried out at elevated<br>
temperatures for shorter time periods.<br><br>
Example 2 (abietic acid (rosin) capped monomer preparation)<br>
To obtain N-[3-(Dimethylammonium)propyl]methacrylamide rosinate salt, N-[3-<br>
(Dimethylamino)propyl]methacryIamide was reacted with abietic acid in the<br>
following way.<br>
N-[3-(Dimethylamino)propyl]methacryIamide (20 g, 0.1175 moles) was<br>
dissolved in methanol (400 mL) and placed in a 1L three-necked round bottom<br>
flask. To this stirring solution solid abietic acid (35.54 g, 0.1175 moles) was<br>
added, using a powder funnel and under a constant N2 purge. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight.<br>
The straw coloured liquid was filtered to remove any residual particulate and the<br>
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resultant dark, viscous liquid<br>
was analysed by 1H nmr and used without further purification.<br>
Example 3 (polymer preparation)<br>
The N-[3-(dimethylammonium)propyl]methacrylamide palmitate salt prepared in<br>
Example 1 was polymerised with isobomylmethacrylate (iBoMA) (20:80) such<br>
that a 50% solids polymer solution was obtained.<br>
A feed solution was prepared comprising N-[3-(dimethylammonium)-<br>
propyl]methacrylamide palmitate (50.14 g, 0.1175 moles) in (3:1) xylene:butanol<br>
(50 g), iBoMA (104.50 g, 0.47 moles), and 2,2'-azobis-(2-methylbutyronitriIe)<br>
AMBN initiator (1.13 g, 0.0059 moles, 1 mole%). This feed solution was added<br>
dropwise over 334 h, with mechanical stirring and under an atmosphere of N2, to<br>
a reaction vessel containing (3:1) xylene:butanol (156 g) at 85°C. After the<br>
monomer addition was complete, the temperature was raised to 95°C and a<br>
boost amount of AMBN (0.56 g, 0.0029 moles) was added. The reaction was<br>
maintained at this elevated temperature for 1 h. The polymer solution was<br>
transferred to a storage vessel on cooling.<br><br>
The above-described experiment was performed under the conditions routinely<br>
employed for this reaction, although variations on these conditions are possible.<br>
Other solvents or solvent blends comprised of common paint solvents can be<br>
used as alternatives. Other co-monomers are, for example, methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate, isobornyl acrylate,<br>
styrene, and other vinylic monomers. Also the ratio of monomers can be<br>
changed. Preferably, the amine-acid salt monomer will be present in an amount<br>
of 5 to 40 mole%, more preferably 10 to 30 mole%. The viscosities of the<br>
polymer solutions are such that materials can be formulated at percentage<br>
solids within the range 45-65%. In addition, alternative initiators such as α,α'-<br>
azoisobutyronitrile (AlBN) can be used.<br>
