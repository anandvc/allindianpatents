				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a) Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an eye treatment device, and more<br>
particularly to the treatment device that provides medicinal or physio-<br>
treatment of the eyes therewith. The present invention primarily utilizes<br>
a piezoelectric ceramic oscillator to actuate percussion boards with high<br>
frequency oscillations, whereupon the percussion boards excite a<br>
mechanical oscillation percussion on channeled liquid film to form<br>
atomized liquid mist micro-droplets, and thereat the atomized liquid mist<br>
micro-droplets are sprayed from a point closest away from the eyes of a<br>
user. The eye treatment device of the present invention further provides<br>
a configuration that retains structural composition of medicament<br>
employed, and realizes low power consumption and high efficacy, and<br>
thereby economizes on power usage while expediting an effective<br>
operating procedure.<br>
(b) Description of the Prior Art<br>
After contact lens were publicly introduced, though benefiting a great<br>
many wearers of spectacles, however, many successive problems<br><br>
developed from wearing such contact lens, because upon wearing the<br>
contact lens, moisture content in the eyes of the wearer continually<br>
evaporates, and thus surface of the contact lens becomes dry as a<br>
result, and the wearer of the contact lens feels uncomfortable, and<br>
experiences hazy eyesight, and is especially serious when the wearer of<br>
the contact lens is located in an environment which is unclean and dry<br>
or the wearer of the contact lens suffers from tears hyposecretion.<br>
Furthermore, procedure for cleaning upkeep and sterilization of the<br>
contact lens is also demanding and complicated. As for routine<br>
purchases that can bring a glistening to eyes of the wearer of the<br>
contact lens, including eyewash or medicinal tablets for taking care of<br>
the contact lens, such can be briefly summarized as follows:<br>
1. Cleaning liquid, which provides good cleaning effectiveness, and<br>
realizes a beneficial sterilization effect, and which can eliminate<br>
microorganisms, including amoeba strains.<br>
2. Physiological saline, which is employed to prevent bacteria from<br>
breeding.<br>
3. De-albumen tablets: classified as usage for enzyme cleaning, and<br>
which decompose and eradicate albumen accumulated on the surface<br>
of the contact lens.<br>
4. Hydrogen peroxide, which is employed to provide the sterilizing<br>
effect. However, effectiveness of the hydrogen peroxide attenuates<br>
upon coming in contact with air and high temperature.<br>
In light of the aforementioned medicaments required for the upkeep of<br>
the contact lens, though some are effective and are provided with<br>
particular functionality, however, a singular characteristic common to<br>
each method of administering the medicaments is namely a necessity to<br>
remove the contact lens in order to administer soaking of the contact<br>
lens, and more particularly is a requirement for a customized device to<br>
deploy rinsing of the contact lens, wherewith compete effectiveness of<br>
the medicaments can only then be achieved.<br>
Recent reports from the medical profession recommend those who<br>
spend a long time operating a computer and viewing a computer screen<br>
to place hot water having a temperature that effectuates easy<br>
evaporation in front of the computer screen, thereby vapor evaporating<br>
from the hot water will assist in moisturizing eyeballs of a person<br>
operating the computer, and thus realize health care of the eyes. Hence,<br>
modern medical treatment has already derived various methods of<br>
treatment in response to specific occupations, and since early times<br>
requirement for moisturizing of the eyes has always been present.<br>
Prior publicly announced Taiwan patents, for instance No. 83204854<br>
"Face Mask Providing Medicament Atomization Treatment for Eyes and<br>
Nose), and No.91207965th (Steam Massage Device for Eyes), wherein,<br>
the "Steam Massage Device for Eyes" utilizes a steam generator and a<br>
heater, wherewith liquid is transformed into steam, which is thereupon<br>
sprayed out from a nozzle. Wherein, if medicaments are employed in<br>
the steam generator, because of a heat reaction, structural composition<br>
of the medicaments is damaged, and thus disadvantageous for usage in<br>
medicinal treatment of the eyes.<br>
Whereas the face mask as disclosed in patent No. 83204854 is<br>
basically configured in a shape of the eyes and nose portion of a user,<br>
and thereby tight fitting when worn. Outward discharge is provided by<br>
means of a tee device having a switch and one entry passage. The<br>
entry passage connects with an atomization sprayer through a conduit,<br>
thereby necessitating atomized spray to pass through the connecting<br>
conduit and thereon to the entry passage, whereupon a selection is<br>
made with the switch of the tee device to direct the atomized spray to<br>
the eyes or nose of the user. Wherein, because the connecting conduit<br>
is of specific length, a mist formed by the atomization sprayer passing<br>
through the connecting conduit therefore produces a liquid damping<br>
effect on a wall of the conduit. Moreover, because of the damping effect,<br>
the mist condenses and forms a liquid that disadvantages pressure<br>
spraying of the mist. Furthermore, if the medicament employed is<br>
changed, remnants of eyewash employed in prior usage will remain,<br>
and is difficult to clean away.<br>
Furthermore, the face mask covers both the eyes and nose portion of<br>
the user, thus If the user only desires to attend to the eyes portion,<br>
unnecessary burden is placed on the nose, and breathing will be even<br>
more difficult as a result. Moreover, gas exhaled by the user will directly<br>
pollute the face mask. In addition, the face mask completely covers a<br>
top half of the face. If attending only to the eyes, then the face mask is<br>
oversized, and quantity of medicament required is correspondingly<br>
increased, thus resulting in wastage of the medicament.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for spraying atomized mist micro-<br>
droplets from a mist generator to the eyes of a user through shortest<br>
distance therebetween, while ensuring fineness of the atomized mist<br>
micro-droplets arriving at the eyes is retained. An embodiment of the<br>
present invention further comprises an ultrasound atomizer utilizing low<br>
power, and which atomizes eyewash or liquid to form the liquid mist<br>
micro-droplets of 2-10 microns in size. An ultraviolet light-emitting diode<br>
irradiates ultraviolet rays that realize production of traces of ozone O3,<br>
thereby attaining effectiveness of sterilization therewith. After the<br>
aforesaid processing, the liquid micro-droplets are sprayed directly onto<br>
contact lens to implement cleaning, lubrication and sterilization thereof.<br>
Because a preferred embodiment of the present invention only requires<br>
an extremely low power consumption of approximately 0.5w, therefore a<br>
battery can be used as a power supply. Furthermore, volume size of the<br>
present invention is minimized to dimensions of conventional goggles,<br>
and therefore facilitates portability, and is thus suitable to implement<br>
cleaning and treatment at anytime and anywhere, thereby furnishing the<br>
present invention with extreme convenience of usage.<br>
The present invention primarily comprises the optimized ultrasound<br>
atomizer of low-power requirements, wherewith eyewash or liquid can<br>
be transformed into micro-droplets of 2-10 microns in size. The<br>
ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV LED) is then utilized to irradiate the<br>
micro-droplets, thereupon simultaneously generating traces of ozone O3,<br>
and because of extreme small size of the micro-droplets, maximum<br>
surface area of the micro-droplets is irradiated, and thus reaction time is<br>
exceedingly short, moreover, only extremely small traces of ozone O3 of<br>
approximately 0.01 -0.015ppm are required. After the micro-droplets<br>
have undergone processing by the ultraviolet rays and the ozone O3the<br>
micro-droplets are atomized and uniformly sprayed onto the contact<br>
lens. Furthermore, powerful oxidization capabilities of the ozone O3 is<br>
utilized to achieve sterilization, which thereby eradicates<br>
microorganisms and decomposes albumen, thereby eliminating build-up<br>
of the albumen. Because the atomized micro-droplets are utilized to<br>
achieve high-speed impact on a surface, effective cleaning away of dirt<br>
is thereby realized, and relieves the user from having to add droplets of<br>
the eyewash to the eyes, which because of blinking of the eyes to light<br>
reflection while adding the eyewash, effectiveness of the eyewash is<br>
affected.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is configured to comprise a cover<br>
member adapted with specifications to cover periphery of the eyes, and<br>
the cover member is positioned at closest distance from a liquid mist<br>
exciter device, thereby a straight line is formed from the liquid mist<br>
exciter device to the eyes of the user via through holes defined in the<br>
cover member. The liquid mist exciter device utilizes a piezoelectric<br>
ceramic oscillator providing high-frequency oscillation to directly actuate<br>
percussion boards, and thereby enables the percussion boards to spray<br>
the liquid mist from an output side directly towards the eyes of the user.<br>
A liquid input side faces liquid films formed by liquid guide members,<br>
which thereat allows the liquid films to undergo micro-excitation. The<br>
liquid guide members channel liquid from a liquid chamber, and after<br>
exploiting a cooling effect the liquid mist is directly sprayed towards the<br>
eyes via the closest distance, thereby realizing treatment of the eyes.<br>
The aforementioned disclosures are thus a primary objective of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to further provide a<br>
reaction chamber having a sterilization effect, and configured in a<br>
partition between the liquid mist output side of the percussion board and<br>
the through hole of the cover member. The ultraviolet light-emitting<br>
diode is configured within the reaction chamber, and which is utilized to<br>
generate the ultraviolet rays therefrom. Because the liquid mist<br>
produced is of a micro-droplet form, the micro-droplets present a<br>
maximum reaction area to the ultraviolet rays, and thus maximize<br>
oxidization and effective sterilization.<br>
A third objective of the present invention is to utilize an additional<br>
inpouring method to accommodate requirements for inpouring of the<br>
liquid, and facilitating quick replacement of the medicament therewith.<br>
Furthermore, a container is employed, and a piezoelectric oscillator is<br>
configured in a base of the container so as to upwardly face a mouth of<br>
the container, and whereby the liquid mist is directly channeled to the<br>
cover member configured atop the liquid container, whereupon the<br>
liquid mist is sprayed through the through holes of the cover member.<br>
A fourth objective of the present invention is to further provide a<br>
configuration that embodies two liquid channels diverging from the liquid<br>
chamber, which respectively channel the liquid to the two percussion<br>
boards, whereupon the two percussion boards actualize synchronous<br>
atomization of the liquid mist, and thereby facilitates synchronous<br>
treatment of the two eyes of the user.<br>
A fifth objective of the present invention is to further provide<br>
configuration of two percussion boards of equal mass on two opposite<br>
side wings of the oscillator, thereby enabling the single central oscillator<br>
to actuate synchronous oscillation of the two percussion boards, and<br>
thus realize a configuration which provides synchronous actuation of<br>
two percussion boards from the single oscillator.<br>
A sixth objective of the present invention is to further configure an<br>
insert and extract assemblage between the percussion boards and the<br>
oscillator, which therewith facilitates replacement or cleaning of the<br>
percussion boards. Wherein requirements may demand replacement of<br>
the percussion boards with percussion boards having grooves of varied<br>
form defined in surfaces of the percussion boards, and wherewith<br>
modifies output quantity of the liquid mist or choice of micro-droplets<br>
formed.<br>
A seventh objective of the present invention is to further utilize<br>
connecting rings to assemble and secure the liquid guide members to<br>
the liquid chamber. The connecting rings thereby enable convenient<br>
replacement or cleaning of the liquid guide members.<br>
An eighth objective of the present invention is to further configure a<br>
clip fastening mechanism to fasten the liquid chamber to the main body,<br>
and thereby facilitate replenishing the liquid in the liquid chamber or<br>
replacing with different medicinal eyewash.<br>
A ninth objective of the present invention is to provide an embodiment<br>
wherein apart from percussion orifices defined in the percussion boards,<br>
line-shaped percussion grooves can be further defined in the surfaces<br>
of the percussion boards, whereby width of the percussion grooves can<br>
be defined so as to be smaller than width of possible dust particles, and<br>
length of the percussion grooves are defined so as to be far longer than<br>
length of the dust particles, thereby preventing blockage by the dust<br>
particles. Furthermore, a distribution of the percussion grooves having<br>
varied shapes or alternate arrangement of shaped lines including curves,<br>
straight lines, angled lines, and so on, are utilized to realize spraying of<br>
varied atomized liquid mist micro-droplets.<br>
A tenth objective of the present invention is to provide the liquid mist<br>
exciter device that primarily utilizes the piezoelectric ceramic oscillator<br>
to actualize the percussion boards, and wherein the plurality of micro<br>
percussion orifices or line-shaped percussion grooves are defined in a<br>
breadth of the percussion boards. Upon the atomized liquid being<br>
channeled through capillary fibers, thereat is conducted to an interface<br>
of the percussion boards and forms the liquid films thereon. Thereupon<br>
a finite energy transmitted by the percussion boards excites the micro<br>
liquid films and forms micro-droplets therefrom, which thereby achieves<br>
objective of atomization, and, moreover, is highly efficient.<br>
An eleventh objective of the present invention is to configure a PS2 or<br>
USB connector on the main body, and which provides for externally<br>
connecting to a host computer that can supply corresponding electric<br>
power, thus when operating the computer, such a connection facilitates<br>
simultaneous acquisition of the liquid vapor that therewith realizes<br>
health care of the eyes.<br>
To enable a further understanding of the said objectives and the<br>
technological methods of the invention herein, the brief description of<br>
the drawings below is followed by the detailed description of the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, which shows an embodiment of the present<br>
invention primarily comprising a box-like form main body 1. A cover<br>
member 2 is configured on a side of the main body 1, and consists of a<br>
flexible rim that can be lightly pressed over surrounding area of an eye<br>
of a user. A through hole 21 is defined within the cover member 2, and a<br>
liquid mist exciter device 4 is directly configured within the through hole<br>
21. Upon storing away the present invention, an anti-dust cover 20 is<br>
placed over the through hole 21, thereby covering and preventing dust<br>
from entering the through hole 21. Compartments 12 are configured on<br>
sides of the main body 1, and a control switch 11 is configured atop the<br>
main body 1. The compartments 12 provide for fitting of batteries therein<br>
or can be suitably adapted for disposing of reciprocal liquid storage<br>
holders therein. The control switch 11 controls functioning of the exciter<br>
device 4. The present invention as disclosed embodies a design of<br>
exquisite configuration and ingenuity.<br>
The present invention utilizes a piezoelectric ceramic oscillator 41<br>
(see FIG. 2) configured within the main body 1, and which directly<br>
actuates a liquid mist percussion board 42. A liquid mist output side of<br>
the percussion board 42 is configured so as to face and be at shortest<br>
distance from the cover member 2. Furthermore, a liquid guide member<br>
5 is configured on a liquid input side of the percussion board 42, and<br>
which is deployed to channel the liquid within a liquid chamber 3<br>
towards the percussion board 42 by means of capillarity. In addition,<br>
mutual interfacial cohesion between the liquid guide member 5 and the<br>
percussion board 42 enables formation of a liquid film, and provides for<br>
the percussion board 42 to effectively realize atomization spraying of<br>
the liquid film. Operating distance for liquid atomization spraying<br>
according to the present invention is approximately 8-10cms (tested<br>
indoors in absence of draughts). Therefore, according to configuration<br>
of the present invention as disclosed, the liquid mist exciter device 4 is<br>
configured at the shortest distance from the cover member 2, and<br>
atomized liquid is sprayed towards the cover member 2. Moreover,<br>
because the liquid is channeled directly through the shortest distance<br>
from the liquid chamber 3 to the cover member 2 by means of the liquid<br>
guide member 5, thus a viscous effect of the liquid is prevented from<br>
occurring during course of the liquid mist being sprayed, and thereby<br>
ensures eventual outspraying liquid mist micro-droplets will not<br>
condense, as well as ensuring uniform fineness of the mist micro-<br>
droplets.<br>
Regarding the liquid mist exciter device 4, the main body 1 utilizes the<br>
piezoelectric ceramic oscillator 41 to actuate an oscillator circuit with an<br>
appropriate frequency. The present invention particularly utilizes the<br>
square percussion board 42, one edge of which is joined to a side of the<br>
oscillator 41, and which is subjected to actuation thereof, while other<br>
three edges are free. A plurality of micro percussion orifices 421 or line-<br>
shaped percussion grooves are defined on a breadth of the percussion<br>
board 42 (see FIG. 6), and such a functional side of the percussion<br>
board 42 utilizes the liquid channeled through the liquid guide member 5,<br>
whereby upon the liquid reaching an end orifice 51 of the liquid guide<br>
member 5 (see FIG. 7), the liquid film forms a three-dimensional<br>
distribution according to surface shape of a fibrous structure of the liquid<br>
guide member 5. When the percussion board 42 is excited, the liquid<br>
film thereby comes in contact with the percussion board 42 and is<br>
adhesively carried away thereof. The liquid carried away is in micro-<br>
droplet form, and undergoes excitation, whereupon the percussion<br>
orifices 421 are subjected to pressure and spray the micro-droplets<br>
outwards. During course of excitation, a corresponding displacement<br>
space between the percussion board 42 and the surface of the liquid<br>
film forms a gap to provide for air to enter and occupy the space there<br>
between, which on being subjected to pressure formed from oscillatory<br>
compression from the percussion board 42, presses and sprays<br>
outwards the micro-droplets adhering within the percussion orifices.<br>
Only the single edge between the square (or rectangular) percussion<br>
board 42 utilized in the present invention and the oscillator 41 are joined<br>
together, the other three edges are free, which apart from such<br>
facilitating assemblage of a special casing, can also lower burden of the<br>
oscillator 41, and, moreover, during course of energy being outputted<br>
from the oscillator 41 and transmitted to an outlying point, free flexing<br>
deformation of the percussion boards 42 is produced that is not subject<br>
to interference from other joined members, and correspondingly<br>
reduces kinetic energy loss in the oscillator 41.<br>
Force from the atomized spray is sufficient to enable the liquid mist to<br>
produce a striking impact mechanical energy, which can be equally<br>
controlled and modulated by means of a switch. The exciter device 4<br>
actuates the percussion board 42 by means of the piezoelectric ceramic<br>
oscillator 41 providing 200 - 300 KHZ high frequency oscillations.<br>
Kinetic energy of the high frequency oscillations thereby enables direct<br>
atomization of the liquid. During course of atomization, because of high<br>
speed of the high frequency oscillations, heat energy generated is<br>
quickly carried away by rapid exchange of the liquid being atomized,<br>
and corresponding cooling results thereof. Hence, temperature of the<br>
liquid mist produced is slightly lower than temperature of the liquid in the<br>
liquid chamber 3. In principle, the exciter device 4 can be deemed to<br>
provide a cooling function, and thus will not alter medical properties of<br>
the liquid within the liquid chamber 3.<br>
The present invention further comprises a sterilizing reaction chamber<br>
40 configured in a partition between the percussion board 42 and the<br>
cover member 2. The sterilizing reaction chamber 40 is basically an<br>
inner circular body, and a sterilization function of the reaction chamber<br>
40 is based on an ultraviolet sterilization effect. Ultraviolet light-emitting<br>
diode lamps 410 are utilized to generate ultraviolet rays, wherewith the<br>
ultraviolet rays irradiate the liquid mist being emitted through the<br>
reaction chamber 40. Along with increasing progress in semiconductor<br>
fabrication, there has also been substantial progress in development of<br>
light-emitting diodes, thus, taking the initiative, the present invention<br>
utilizes the ultraviolet light-emitting diode lamps 410 to produce ozone<br>
O3 within the reaction chamber 40, and because of high-efficiency of the<br>
ultraviolet light-emitting diode, wavelength uniformity is high and volume<br>
size of the ultraviolet light-emitting diode is small, therefore the<br>
ultraviolet light-emitting diode lamps are utilized as ultraviolet light<br>
sources, which thereby realizes a portable product that provides saving<br>
in electrical power and ingenuity in design. In addition, the ultraviolet<br>
light-emitting diode lamps 410 operate in coordination with spheroidal<br>
design of the reaction chamber 40 to prevent the ultraviolet rays from<br>
scattering and leaking out. The ozone O3 produced within the reaction<br>
chamber 40 is atomized and sprayed outwards. A 50% alternating light<br>
and extinguish DUTY CYCLE is utilized to power the light-emitting diode<br>
lamps 410, thereby minimizing decrease in light-emitting efficiency of<br>
the light-emitting diode lamps 410 affected by rise in temperature of<br>
same. Furthermore, because diameter of the liquid micro-droplets is<br>
only 2-10 um, therefore a unit cubic measurement of the liquid after<br>
being atomized to form liquid mist micro-droplets, because the liquid<br>
has undergone decomposition of form and structure to produce the<br>
micro-droplets, total surface area the atomized liquid mist comes in<br>
contact with is extremely large. Hence, only approximately 10ppm of<br>
ozone O3 is expended to achieve an effective sterilization reaction that<br>
is rapid and uniform.<br>
Similarly, the ultraviolet light-emitting diode lamps 410 can also be<br>
configurationally designed and deployed to cast ultraviolet rays towards<br>
transparent body of the liquid chamber 3, thereby enabling the liquid<br>
within the liquid chamber 3 to similarly receive the corresponding<br>
ultraviolet ray effect from the ultraviolet light-emitting diode lamps 410.<br>
If the liquid chamber 3 is adapted with heat-resistant functionality,<br>
then hot liquid of high temperature can be stored therein. Upon the<br>
percussion board 42 being actuated, because of high velocity, the liquid<br>
mist produced from the high-temperature hot liquid is of correspondingly<br>
high temperature, which can therefore be employed for fomenting the<br>
face of the user, for instance, physiotherapy procedures of steam<br>
fomenting. The liquid chamber 3 can be further configured with a<br>
heating device. However, because an objective of the present invention<br>
is to provide for convenience of portability, and consideration has also<br>
been given for degree of labor required in manufacturing, thus primary<br>
inspiration behind the present invention is to provide a selective design<br>
that benefits convenience for outdoor usage.<br>
Because electric power requirements for accurate operation of the<br>
exciter device 4 utilized by the present invention is approximately 50mA,<br>
thus a connector can be further configured at a power supply input<br>
terminal, and which provides for connecting to a PS2, USB or equivalent<br>
port of a computer, thereby when operating the computer, the host<br>
computer provides for facilitating a supply of electric power to the exciter<br>
device 4 as provided by the host computer terminal.<br>
The piezoelectric ceramic oscillator 41 of the present invention utilizes<br>
a linear conversion method to achieve objective of actuating a<br>
piezoelectric strip, and therefore the present invention adapts efficiency<br>
of an electric circuit to attain an efficiency n &gt; 85%. During<br>
implementation, the present invention utilizes a direct current working<br>
voltage of 3VDC, whereby main power consumption is 0.5 watt-hour,<br>
which thereby achieves a standard atomization measurement of 100cc<br>
per hour.<br>
Furthermore, the electric circuit utilizes a CONSTANT VOLTAGE<br>
(CV), and by monitoring and controlling load lightness and power<br>
consumption of the exciter device 4, a load regulation error<br>
measurement within 1% can thereby be achieved, moreover, a line<br>
regulation range of at least ±50% can be attained.<br>
In addition, a frequency constant and an output power constant can<br>
be altered by varying resistivity, thereby optionally regulating<br>
atomization state, and thus further providing the present invention with<br>
extreme convenience.<br>
In order to further facilitate replacing the liquid, the present invention<br>
adapts a container 8 (see FIG. 3), whereby a piezoelectric oscillator 420<br>
is configured in a base either internal or external to the container 8.<br>
Wherein, if the piezoelectric oscillator 420 is configured in the base<br>
external to the container 8, material the container 8 is made from is<br>
required to be provided with flexibility, thereby effectively allowing<br>
bearing of an entire load and oscillating of supporting liquid therewith,<br>
while realizing atomization of the liquid. Apart from the piezoelectric<br>
oscillator 420 adapting specifications of the piezoelectric oscillator 41 of<br>
the aforementioned (as depicted in FIG. 2) configuration, the<br>
piezoelectric oscillator 420 can be adapted to be of disc-shape form<br>
having axial amplitude of oscillation (see FIG. 3), and be employed and<br>
configured on the base interior to the liquid container 8. After inpouring<br>
of the liquid into the liquid container 8, mechanical energy of the axial<br>
amplitude of oscillation is transmitted through the liquid to surface of the<br>
liquid, whereupon interference of oscillating waves on the surface of the<br>
liquid realizes excitation of the liquid and produces liquid mist therefrom.<br>
Such a configuration can be utilized in situations where immovable<br>
atomization is applicable, for instance, for usage in a home or indoors,<br>
and so on. The cover member 2 is perpendicularly configured at closest<br>
distance to a mouth of the liquid container 8. The user adopts a face<br>
down position, and positions the eyes over the cover member 2, thereby<br>
allowing spraying of the eyes.<br>
The aforementioned disc-shaped piezoelectric oscillator 420 can also<br>
be configured in the base external to the liquid container 8, thereby<br>
realizing reduction in processing work required for electrical insulation,<br>
and whereby the material the container 8 is made from is required to be<br>
provided with flexibility. Hence, the axial amplitude of oscillation of the<br>
disc-shaped piezoelectric oscillator 420 is transmitted through the base<br>
and the liquid of the liquid container 8, and synchronously achieves<br>
uniform oscillation thereof.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, which shows the reaction chamber 40 of the<br>
present invention configured basically in form of an inner body. A<br>
percussion board 42 is configured on a side of the reaction chamber 40.<br>
The liquid guide member 5 is configured on one side of the percussion<br>
board 42, and which is utilized as an input terminal-channel for the liquid<br>
to pass through. The ultraviolet light-emitting diode lamps 410 are<br>
oppositely configured within the reaction chamber 40, and which provide<br>
for emitting ultraviolet rays therefrom. When the liquid mist sprayed out<br>
by the percussion board 42 passes through the reaction chamber 40,<br>
thereat the ultraviolet rays irradiate maximum surface area of the liquid<br>
mist, which is then sprayed towards the face of the user through a<br>
contractile orifice 45. Furthermore, a shade panel is configured between<br>
the contractile orifice 45 and the ultraviolet light-emitting diode lamps<br>
410, wherewith enables obstructing light source irradiation from the<br>
ultraviolet ray generators 410 from directly intruding the eyes. Because<br>
the reaction chamber 40 is configured as a circular body having specific<br>
capacity, the liquid mist flowing through allows for a partial anti-<br>
condensation effect, and the liquid that condenses can be wiped away,<br>
thereby cleaning away accumulation of the liquid. A liquid discharge<br>
device 43 can also be employed to channel out the remaining liquid.<br>
The liquid discharge device 43 can be so configured to exploit a<br>
capillary effect or any device configured to absorb liquid can be utilized,<br>
and is thus not described in further detail herein.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, which shows the main body 1 of the present<br>
invention adapted with a configurationally format defined with a pair of<br>
orifices, and comprising the lengthwise eye cover member 2 configured<br>
on the single main body 1, wherein the two through holes 21 are defined<br>
in the lengthwise eye cover member 2, and each of the through holes<br>
21 provide for a passage with the percussion boards 42. The reaction<br>
chambers 40 can be respectively configured between the percussion<br>
board 42 and the through hole 21 in each side of the main body 1. A<br>
power supply device 6 is configured on one side of the main body 1,<br>
and a fastening method connecting the liquid chamber 3 is further<br>
configured to the main body 1 thereof. A pressure balance valve 31 is<br>
configured atop the liquid chamber 3 to respond to atmospheric<br>
pressure. A control switch 13 is positionally configured on one side of<br>
the main body 1, and which facilitates finger operation of the present<br>
invention therewith. Butt straps 14 are respectively configured on each<br>
of two sides of the main body 1, thereby enabling employment of any<br>
type of strap to securely fasten the present invention to the head of the<br>
user. Because power requirements of the present invention is extremely<br>
low, a battery providing 3 VDC is utilized or when being used at home,<br>
electrical voltage supplied at the home can be converted to direct<br>
current. In addition, any hand operated electric power dynamo can also<br>
be employed to provide electrical power requirements of the power<br>
supply device 6. Because the eye cover member 2 is of a form providing<br>
a lengthwise opening which is shaped to correspond with curve of the<br>
face of the user, hence, a recess 22 is centrally defined in a lower edge<br>
of the eye cover member 2 to correspond with bridge of the nose of the<br>
face of the user, thereby facilitating wearing, whereby the recess 22<br>
provides an opening for positioning of the bridge of the nose therein.<br>
Furthermore, the eye cover member 2 is made from a material provided<br>
with flexibility, therefore lightly pressing a peripheral edge of the eye<br>
cover member 2 onto surface of the face of the user thereby realizes<br>
press-fitting of the eye cover member 2 onto the face of the user, and<br>
secure fitment thereof. The liquid chamber 3 can adapt a clip<br>
assemblage method to clip to the main body 1, whereby configuration of<br>
the clip assemblage utilizes a general mechanism as provided by a<br>
conventional coupling assemblage, and thus is not described in further<br>
detail herein.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, which shows a configuration providing two liquid<br>
channels 30 diverging from the liquid chamber 3, and which separately<br>
provide for the liquid to be channeled to the two liquid guide members 5.<br>
After passing through the liquid guide members 5, the liquid thereupon<br>
forms the liquid film on each surface of the end orifices 51 (see FIG. 7)<br>
by means of the capillary effect, and which thereby provide sources of<br>
liquid films for the percussion boards 42. The percussion boards 42 are<br>
correspondingly configured on opposite side wings of the piezoelectric<br>
ceramic oscillator 41, and so positioned so as to directly face the end<br>
orifices 51 of the liquid guide members 5. The piezoelectric ceramic<br>
oscillator 41 thereby synchronously actuates the two side percussion<br>
boards 42 which effectuate a percussion effect on the liquid passing<br>
through the liquid guide members 5. The liquid films formed after<br>
oscillation thereupon pass through percussion orifices 421 defined in<br>
the percussion boards 42, and thereat undergoes pressure slicing,<br>
which thus actualizes atomization of the liquid film. Structural<br>
configuration and mass of the two percussion boards 42 are equal,<br>
which thereby enables producing mist of uniform form. Accordingly,<br>
configuration of the exciter device 4 as disclosed above can be utilized<br>
for actualizing excitation within the reactor chamber as depicted in FIG.<br>
4.<br>
In addition, to order to accommodate different properties and<br>
characteristics so formed between the end orifices 51 and the<br>
percussion boards 42 by the liquid guide members 5, while still enabling<br>
the percussion boards 42 to attain actualization of liquid films of<br>
invariable form, a channeling diffusion piece 510 is respectively<br>
configured between the liquid guide member 5 and the percussion<br>
board 42 on each side of the exciter device 4. The diffusion pieces 510<br>
also provide a liquid guide capillary function, whereby the diffusion<br>
pieces 510 utilized are of specific form, structure and material, and<br>
together with frontal interfaces of the percussion boards 42 can thereby<br>
provide the liquid film with specific form and structure, which can then<br>
furnish the percussion boards 42. Furthermore, reverse sides of the<br>
percussion boards 42 directly face the end orifices 51 of the liquid guide<br>
members 5. The liquid guide members 5 are fabricated from any<br>
material and configured such to channel and replenish supply of the<br>
liquid to the end orifices 51.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, which shows the liquid chamber 3 and the liquid<br>
guide members 5 assembled in an embedded type fashion, whereby the<br>
liquid guide members 5 are embedded into tube orifices 32 while outer<br>
extremities retain the end orifices 51. Connecting rings 33 are<br>
respectively configured between the tube orifice 32 and the end orifice<br>
51 on each side of the exciter device 4, firstly to collar down the liquid<br>
guide members 5, and further realizing an assemblage on the tube<br>
orifices 32 of the liquid chamber 3, while also functioning to facilitate<br>
assembling and disassembling of the liquid guide members 5 from the<br>
liquid chamber 3, and thereby conveniencing insertion and extraction of<br>
the liquid guide member 5, as well as realizing waterproofing therewith.<br>
Accordingly, utilizing an insert and extract assemblage as disclosed<br>
facilitates replacing or cleaning of the liquid guide members 5, and<br>
employment of the connecting rings 33 also indirectly assist in<br>
waterproofing and maintaining airtightness between the liquid guide<br>
members 5 and the tube orifices 32.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, which shows an assemblage of the piezoelectric<br>
ceramic oscillator 41 and the percussion boards 42 according to the<br>
present invention, whereby soldering or any mode of adhesive bonding<br>
can be employed to join the piezoelectric ceramic oscillator 41 to the<br>
percussion boards 42. However, in order to further facilitate<br>
replacement of the percussion boards 42, the present invention can also<br>
employ a clip fastening mechanism 7 configured on a surface of the<br>
piezoelectric ceramic oscillator 41, which thereby provides a fastening<br>
method which conveniences replacement of the percussion boards 42.<br>
The clip fastening mechanism 7 utilizes clips 71 to clip down the<br>
percussion boards 42 thereof, and thereby an assemblage that<br>
accommodates convenient inserting and dismantling of the percussion<br>
boards 42 is actualized.<br>
An objective of the insert and extract assemblage is to facilitate the<br>
user in dismantling and replacing or cleaning the percussion boards 42.<br>
If requirements demand, the percussion boards 42 can also be<br>
dismantled and replaced with percussion boards 42 defined with varied<br>
shaped-holes (see FIG. 9), whereby, apart from the percussion orifices<br>
421 defined in the percussion boards 42, as aforementioned and<br>
depicted in FIG. 6, line-shaped percussion grooves 422 can be further<br>
defined in the surfaces of the percussion boards 42. The percussion<br>
grooves 422 can be shaped to form curves, straight lines, angled lines,<br>
and so on, wherein width of the percussion grooves 422 are defined<br>
such to be smaller than width of common dust particles (definition of<br>
dimensions and external form of the dust particles affects injury to the<br>
eyes), and length of the percussion grooves 422.are defined so as to be<br>
far longer than length of the dust particles. Hence, utilization of the line-<br>
shaped percussion grooves 422 realizes significant reduction in<br>
probability of the dust particles blocking the percussion boards 42. If a<br>
dust particle should block one of the percussion grooves 422, because<br>
the length of the percussion grooves 422 is far greater than the length of<br>
the dust particles, thus the dust particle will not affect compete<br>
obstruction, and unhindered atomization is ensured.<br>
It is of course to be understood that the embodiments described<br>
herein is merely illustrative of the principles of the invention and that a<br>
wide variety of modifications thereto may be effected by persons skilled<br>
