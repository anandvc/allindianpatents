				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for providing<br>
communication between an antenna arrangement and a radio	base<br>
station at a site. Particularly the invention relates to	base<br>
station antenna feeding. The invention also relates to a	base<br>
station and antenna arrangement with an arrangement	for<br>
providing signal communication therebetween.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
In order to provide for communication between an antenna<br>
arrangement and mobile base stations at a site coaxial feeder<br>
cables are used today. However, the losses tend to be<br>
considerable in such cables, the higher the frequency of the<br>
transmitted signals, the higher the losses. In order to reduce<br>
the losses, it is exceedingly important to use cables which<br>
are as thick as possible for the communication between the<br>
active parts of a base station and the antenna arrangement<br>
mounted on a mounting structure, for example a mast, at the<br>
base station site. The need of thick cables is also<br>
particularly of importance since the base stations generally<br>
contain all the electronics; today there is practically no<br>
electronic at all in the antenna itself.<br>
A common dimension of coaxial cables used today is 1.25 inch<br>
cables which have a loss about 0.05 dB/m for 2.2 GHz frequency<br>
signals.<br>
The fact that the losses tend to be considerable and that<br>
hence even very thick cables are needed, is a serious problem<br>
as such, among other since thick cables get bulky, heavy and<br>
require a lot of space.<br>
This problem gets even more pronounced due to the fact that,<br>
today, the antenna arrangement at a base station site mostly<br>
consist of several antennas, and generally each antenna has<br>
2<br><br>
two polarizations. It is also common to use so called sector<br>
antennas, e.g. at so called three sector sites, with three<br>
sector antennas, which hence require six (if there are two<br>
polarizations) different feeder cables between the base<br>
station and the antenna arrangement, particularly all provided<br>
along the mast on which the antenna arrangement is mounted.<br>
For a six sector site the number of cables will<br>
correspondingly be twelve. In addition thereto it is becoming<br>
common to use dual or triple frequency band antennas; this<br>
means that the number of cables that is required will be even<br>
higher, and all these cables somehow have to be bundled<br>
together.<br>
This is extremely disadvantageous, since several meters of<br>
thick, coaxial cables have to be provided on or close to a<br>
mounting structure such as a mast. For the first, it is very<br>
unsatisfactory from an aesthetic point of view. Second it is<br>
inconvenient since, due to the fact that thick cables are<br>
required, there will be a certain attenuation as well. In<br>
addition therefo installation and mounting will be time<br>
consuming and complicated and thereto also expensive, and the<br>
cables may particularly occupy a large portion of the space of<br>
the total mounting structure and hence will predominate<br>
visually.<br>
The more complicated the antenna arrangement, i.e. the more<br>
sectors, frequency bands etc, the more time consuming and<br>
difficult it will be to mount the communication arrangement<br>
consisting of a plurality of thick cables between the antenna<br>
arrangement and the base station itself, and the higher losses<br>
will have to be reckoned with.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore an arrangement as initially<br>
referred  to,  which  enables  communication between  a  base<br>
3<br><br>
station and an antenna arrangement which is comparatively<br>
slim, and not complex, and which is easy to mount or install.<br>
Still further an arrangement is needed which has low losses<br>
and which is flexible, i.e. which can be used with different<br>
types of anntenna arrangements, particularly with antenna<br>
arrangements comprising several antennas which may have<br>
different polarisations and/or which may be dual or triple<br>
frequency band antennas and which may be of sector type.<br>
Particularly an arrangement is needed which is aesthetic and<br>
which has a low attenuation. Moreover an arrangement is needed<br>
which can be used in high frequency systems, i.e. in<br>
communication systems using frequencies of more than about<br>
2 GHz. Particularly an arrangement is needed which can be made<br>
long and which can be used for a large number of signals, e.g.<br>
for sector antennas of dual polarisation type and for more<br>
than one frequency band. Still further an arrangement is<br>
needed which is easy to fabricate and to transport to the site<br>
and which can be produced and handled without high<br>
manufacturing high costs. Still further an arrangement isd<br>
needed which requires little or no maintenance, which easily<br>
can be replaced and which is robust and durable.<br>
Therefore an arrangement as initally referred to is provided<br>
which comprises a waveguide arrangement connected to a radio<br>
base station and to an antenna arrangement. In one embodiment<br>
the waveguide arrangement is connected directly to the radio<br>
base station and/or directly to the antenna arrangement. This<br>
means that it may be connected directly to the radio base<br>
station but indirectly to the antenna arrangement or vice<br>
versa. Of course it may also be connected directly to the<br>
radio base station and to the antenna arrangement. In another<br>
or in other implementations the waveguide arrangement is<br>
connected indirectly to the radio base station and/or<br>
indirectly to the antenna arrangement via intermediate<br>
connecting means  such as  for example  jumper  cables  and<br>
4<br><br>
connectors disposed at the waveguide arrangement end or ends.<br>
Particularly it comprises coax-to-waveguide transitions. In<br>
another embodiment the waveguide arrangement comprises<br>
waveguide connecting portions which are connected directly to<br>
the radio base station and/or directly connected to the<br>
antenna arrangement.<br>
Particularly the waveguide arrangement is connected to or<br>
associated with an antenna mounting structure, e.g. a mast or<br>
similar. Alternative the waveguide arrangement is adapted to<br>
be incorporated in or taken up in an antenna arrangement<br>
mounting structure. Particularly it is used to provide<br>
communication with an antenna arrangement comprising several<br>
antennas, for example a multisector antenna with several<br>
sector antennas. The waveguide arrangement particularly<br>
comprises a plurality of compartments, each acting as a<br>
waveguide particularly for a signal to an antenna. Each<br>
antenna, for example the multisector antenna, or the antenna<br>
if it only comprises one antenna, may have two polarisations,<br>
the waveguide arrangement comprising one waveguide compartment<br>
for each polarisation and for each antenna, hence for a dual<br>
polarisation antenna it comprises two compartments for each<br>
sector antenna.<br>
The invention is applicable to most different kinds of antenna<br>
arrangements. In one embodiment it provides communication with<br>
an antenna arrangement comprising dual band antennas, in<br>
another embodiment with a triple band antenna arrangement. To<br>
provide communication with a sector antenna, there may be one<br>
waveguide compartment for each antenna, particularly one for<br>
each frequency band of each antenna, and/or polarization each<br>
antenna of the antenna arrangement.<br>
Particularly the waveguide arrangement comprises a<br>
longitudinal  metal  profile  structure  with  a  number  of<br>
5<br><br>
waveguides formed by compartments, e.g. one for each antenna,<br>
particularly one for each polarisation and one for each band<br>
thereof etc. depending on what is applicable.<br>
It may be selected according	to the requirements on allowed<br>
loss  factor  etc.  In  other	embodiments  there  is/are  some<br>
compartment(s) which is/are	multimode compartments, others<br>
which are not.<br>
In one embodiment the metal profile structure has a circular<br>
cross-section, in other embodiments it has an oval,<br>
trapezoidal, triangular or an elliptic cross-section. In still<br>
another embodiment it has a rectangular, or particularly a<br>
square shaped, cross-section.<br>
The metal profile structure cross-section can be different<br>
from that of the respective compartments. The profile<br>
structure may e.g. be circular, the compartments rectangular<br>
or vice versa. Any combination is possible.<br>
Preferably the metal profile structure is made of some low<br>
loss conducting material e.g. aluminium (A1) or a material<br>
with similar properties. It may also be made of a material<br>
which is coated with a low conducting material e.g. aluminium.<br>
In one embodiment the waveguide arrangement comprises a. number<br>
of waveguides, each with a rectangular cross-section defined<br>
by a waveguide width and a waveguide height. In order to allow<br>
for RF signals to propagate, the width of the waveguides has<br>
to exceed λ/2 of the feed signal. The other dimension of a<br>
rectangular waveguide compartment, the height, is not<br>
restricted to a particular dimension and does actually not<br>
affect the propagation of an RF signal, and therefore it can<br>
be made low.<br>
6<br><br>
In one particular implementation the waveguide arrangement<br>
comprises one waveguide which is common for a number of<br>
signals to/from different antennas (and/or for different<br>
polarisations, frequency bands) and different signals are<br>
carried by different waveguide modes in said common waveguide.<br>
In a particular embodiment the waveguide arrangement comprises<br>
a limited number of waveguide compartments each of which<br>
carrying a number of signals to/from a given number of<br>
antennas (polarisations, frequency bands) by means of<br>
different modes. The height dimension particularly determines<br>
the loss performance of the waveguides. In one embodiment a<br>
waveguide width is approximately 0.6 λ - 1.0 λ, e.g. 0.80 λ<br>
which corresponds to 90-150, e.g. 120 mm for a 2 GHz UMTS<br>
(Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) signal.<br>
Particularly the height of the respective waveguide is about<br>
1/4 to 1/8 of the width, particularly around 10-30 mm.<br>
Particularly the waveguide dimension, for a 2 GHz signal, is<br>
120 x 20 mm. The typical loss will then be 0.025 dB/m. If the<br>
height of the waveguides is 10 mm, the loss will be about 0.05<br>
dB/m. It should be clear that these figures merely are given<br>
for illustrative purposes.<br>
In one embodiment, the antenna structure comprises a single or<br>
monolithic structure. In a preferred embodiment the<br>
arrangement, or the metal profile structure, comprises a<br>
number of sections which are connected to each other such the<br>
length of the arrangement substantially corresponds to the sum<br>
of the lengths of the individual sections.<br>
In one embodiment with a common multimode waveguide, the<br>
individual sections are telescopically connected to each<br>
other.<br>
7<br><br>
The invention also relates to a base station site with a radio<br>
base station and an antenna arrangement with communication<br>
means for providing communication between the base station and<br>
the antenna arrangement, and an antenna mounting structure,<br>
for example a mast or similar. The communication means<br>
particularly comprises a waveguide arrangement, which<br>
waveguide arrangement is associated with or comprised by, or<br>
integrated in, the mounting structure.<br>
Particularly the waveguide arrangement comprises a number of<br>
parallell waveguides. Particularly the mounting structure<br>
comprises a mast with a number of legs, each leg comprising<br>
one or more waveguides of the waveguide arrangement.<br>
Particularly the waveguide arrangement comprises a number of<br>
compartments, each carrying signals to/from an antenna of the<br>
antenna arrangement. Alternatively it comprises a common<br>
waveguide supporting propagation of a number of different<br>
modes, each carrying one signal to/from one antenna of the<br>
antenna arrangement, which may comprise a plurality of<br>
antennas, e.g. being a sector antenna, dual polarised<br>
antennas, dual or triple band antennas in any combination.<br>
Particularly the invention relates to the use of an<br>
arrangement as discussed above in a cellular mobile<br>
communication system operating at about 2 GHz or more. Of<br>
course, an arrangement according to the inventive concept is<br>
applicable for other frequency ranges as well.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows an antenna arrangement 1A, 2A mounted on a<br>
mounting structure 4, here in the form of a mast, to which the<br>
two antennas 1A, 1B are mounted. For communication with the<br>
base station (not shown) a waveguide arrangement 3 is<br>
associated with the mast structure 4. In this embodiment<br>
jumper cables 2A, 2B are provided for connection to the<br>
antennas 1A, 1B. It should be clear that the waveguide<br>
arrangement 3 also is connected to the base station for<br>
example via jumper cables (not shown). Hence, in this<br>
embodiment the waveguide arrangement 3 is associated with or<br>
connected to the mast structure 4. In an alternative<br>
embodiment it may be integrated in the mast structure, or more<br>
generally in the mounting structure. In the embodiment of Fig.<br>
10<br><br>
1 the waveguide arrangement 3 is illustrated as consisting of<br>
one large section. However, preferably, it is generally<br>
divided into a plurality of sections of appropriate lengths,<br>
which is advantageous for fabrication, transportation and<br>
installation purposes. In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
waveguide arrangement or the individually waveguides provided<br>
therein, might be connected directly to the antenna and/or the<br>
base station. In case jumper cables are used, connectors are<br>
required at each end of the respective waveguides. It should<br>
be clear that the antenna arrangement may comprise more than<br>
two antennas or it could be just one antenna. Of course also<br>
different kinds of antennas may be used, for example three<br>
antennas for a three sector site or six sector antennas for a<br>
six sector site etc. Each antenna may have two polarisations<br>
and the antenna (s) additionally may be dual or triple band<br>
antennas etc.<br>
Unless waveguide connecting means are used, cf. Fig. 4, coax-<br>
to-waveguide transitions are required both for connection to<br>
the antennas and for connection to the base station. Fig. 1<br>
only shows the basic concept of the present invention wherein<br>
a waveguide arrangement is used instead of thick cables.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another embodiment in which the waveguide<br>
arrangement comprises, here, three waveguide sections 311, 312,<br>
313 which are interconnected by means of flanges 911, 912, 913.<br>
The uppermost waveguide section 311 is via a flange 911<br>
connected to a waveguide feed transition 51 providing<br>
transitions to cables 2A1, 2B1, 2C1 connecting to the, here,<br>
three antennas (not shown). Similarly a waveguide feed<br>
transition 61 is connected to the lowermost waveguide section<br>
313 via a flange 914 providing transitions to the cables 7A1,<br>
7A2, 7A3 connecting to the base station (not shown) . The<br>
waveguide arrangement may take any of the forms as will be<br>
11<br><br>
described more thoroughly below, but also several other<br>
embodiments are possible.<br>
Fig. 3A illustrates a part of a waveguide arrangement 32<br>
comprising three waveguide compartments (cf. illustration of<br>
waveguide arrangement cross-section taken along A-A in Fig.<br>
3B) via a flange 92 connected to a transition arrangement 52<br>
with coax to waveguide transitions 821, 822, 823 via cables 2A2,<br>
2B2, 2C2 to three sector antennas of which only the first<br>
sector antenna 1A2 is shown.<br>
Fig. 3B shows an example of a cross-sectional view of a<br>
waveguide arrangement (as in Fig. 3A) comprising three<br>
waveguide compartments C1, C2, C3. The respective waveguides<br>
are rectangular waveguides with a width W32 approximately ≥<br>
λ/2. The dimension of the width has to be such in order to<br>
enable for RF signals to propagate. The height H32 is not<br>
restricted by the wavelength and it can be made quite small.<br>
Particualarly the height determines the loss performance of<br>
the waveguide. A typical loss for an air-filled aluminium<br>
waveguide with the dimensions 120 x 20 mm is approximately<br>
0.025 dB/m for a 2 GHz frequency signal. If the height is<br>
about 5 mm, the loss is about 0.088 dB/m, if it is about 10<br>
mm, the loss will be about 0.045 dB/m, for a height which is<br>
about 15 mm, the loss will be approximately 0.031 dB/m, and<br>
for a height of 20 mm it will be about 0.024 dB/m. Thus, the<br>
loss is inversely proportional to H.<br>
The losses should be compared with the loss for a 1.25 Inch<br>
cable, which is about 0.05 dB/m. At high frequencies (more<br>
than 2GHz) the difference between the losses in an air-filled<br>
waveguide and a coaxial cable increases. The waveguide is in<br>
principle independent of the frequency whereas for a coaxial<br>
cable the loss in dB is proportional to the frequency due to<br>
12<br><br>
dielectric loss. Dielectrical losses can more easily be<br>
avoided in rigid waveguides.<br>
In this embodiment the rectangular waveguides C1, C2, C3 are<br>
rectangular and stacked in a common metal profile 32<br>
comprising the waveguide arrangement. In this particular<br>
embodiment the exterior of the profile is rectangular. It may<br>
of course also be circular or of any other appropriate shape.<br>
For a 2GHz UMTS-signal, a typical size could be 0.8 λ, which<br>
is approximately 120 mm.<br>
Particularly one waveguide or one compartment acts as a<br>
waveguide for one feed signal. As will be more thoroughly<br>
discussed below, multimode implementations are also possible<br>
in which one waveguide may support propagation of more than<br>
one mode.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another embodiment of a waveguide arrangement 33<br>
(which may have any cross-section as will be further described<br>
below, for example comprising a number of rectangular<br>
compartments etc. but it may also comprise a number of, or a<br>
single waveguide, supporting different modes, one for each<br>
feed signal). In this embodiment, however, the waveguide<br>
arrangement is via a waveguide connection 63 directly connected<br>
to the base station 10 and via a waveguide connection 53<br>
connected directly to, here, a three sector antenna (not<br>
shown) and hence comprising three waveguide connections<br>
531, 532, 533. The waveguide arrangement 33 is connected via<br>
flange 931 to the antenna waveguide connection 53 and via a<br>
flange 932 connected to the base station 10 via the waveguide<br>
connection 63. The flanges 931, 932 can be of any conventional<br>
kind. The waveguide connections may alternatively be soldered<br>
onto the waveguide arrangement 33. Even if the waveguide<br>
arrangement 33 in this figure is shown as comprising one<br>
13<br><br>
section only, it may of course alternatively comprise several<br>
sections as for example discussed with reference to Fig. 2. In<br>
this embodiment there are no coax-to-waveguide transitions,<br>
and hence specifically adapted or special types of<br>
antennas/base stations are required.<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of a waveguide arrangement 34<br>
comprising n rectangular waveguides 1, 2,... n with a width W<br>
lager than or substantially equal to λ/2 as discussed above.<br>
The outer walls are conducting and the interior of the<br>
waveguides comprise air or a low-loss dielectric material. The<br>
supported fundamental mode is here TE10. The waveguides may<br>
also support higher order modes, in this case TE20, TE30 etc,<br>
but then they must be larger. Hence, each individual waveguide<br>
may support one or more modes, each waveguide handling one<br>
feed signal, or if multiple modes or supported, each mode<br>
holding one feed signal.<br>
Fig. 6 shows still another embodiment of a cross-section of a<br>
waveguide arrangement 35 which in principle also acts as an<br>
arrangement with a number of rectangular waveguides<br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the length of which (the outer segments<br>
1, 2, 3) should be larger than or substantially equal to λ/2.<br>
The innermost waveguide comprises a circular waveguide for<br>
corresponding modes. Also in this case the fundamental<br>
supported mode is TE10, but the individual waveguides may also<br>
support higher order modes such as TE20, TE30 etc.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a cross-section of an embodiment of a waveguide<br>
arrangement 36 which comprises a coaxial waveguide in a<br>
multilayer implementation, comprising n layers. The<br>
fundamental supported mode is here TEM similar to a coaxial<br>
cable. The first higher order mode that might be supported is<br>
TE11 etc. According to different embodiments each waveguide<br>
compartment supports one mode, but if it is supported, i.e. if<br>
14<br><br>
the dimensions of the waveguides are larger (large enough), it<br>
is possible for multiple modes to propagate.<br>
Fig. 8A schematically illustrates the fundamental propagating<br>
mode for a rectangular waveguide with width W and height H.<br>
The walls of the waveguide are conducting and have a thickness<br>
exceeding the electrical penetration depth. As referred to<br>
above the supported fundamental mode is in such an embodiment<br>
TE10, i.e. an electrical field transversal with respect to the<br>
direction of propagation. If a larger width is used, higher<br>
order modes may be supported for feeding signals.<br>
Fig. 8B schematically illustrates the supported waveguide mode<br>
of a circular waveguide (CWG) which also has conducting walls<br>
etc., c.f. Fig. 8A. The fundamental propagating mode is here<br>
TE11. With a larger cross-section, it may also support one or<br>
more higher order modes, for example TM01.<br>
Fig. 8C is a cross-sectional view of a coaxial waveguide<br>
wherein b here corresponds to the radius of the outer<br>
conductor and a is the radius of the inner conductor. Higher<br>
order modes may be supported if a a larger radius is selected,<br>
e.g. TE11 etc.<br>
It should be clear that these figures merely show some<br>
examples on waveguide cross-sections.<br>
Fig. 9 is a very simplified view of a waveguide arrangement 36<br>
comprising a number of waveguide compartments 371,...,376, one for<br>
each feed signal to an antenna arrangement/a base station,<br>
each waveguide comprising a connector 671,..., 676 for connection<br>
to the base station (the respective antenna) as discussed<br>
earlier in the application.<br>
Fig. 10 shows one example of a coaxial-waveguide transition<br>
for a multimode implementation according to the invention. It<br>
15<br><br>
shows a cross-section of a rectangular waveguide 37. TE10<br>
feeding is provided by means of the central metal conductor 81<br>
of a coaxial cable with outer conductors 87. TE20 feeding is<br>
provided by means of a phase shifted 890 which provides two<br>
signals phase shifted +/- 90° and which are fed via the central<br>
conductors 82, 83 of two coaxial-waveguide transitions 881, 882.<br>
TE10 is fed symetrically and TE20 is fed differentially.<br>
An alternative embodiment (not shown) is using a 4-port<br>
sum/delta-divider where the TE10 mode is fed to the sum-port<br>
resulting in two identical (symmetric feeding) signals fed to<br>
82 and 83, and where the TE20 mode is fed to the delta-port<br>
resulting in two equal amplitude but 180° phase shifted<br>
(differential feeding) signals simultaneiously fed to 82 and<br>
83. The divider is reciprocal so that the principle applies<br>
for transmission in both directions.<br>
It should be clear that different kinds of waveguides can be<br>
used. It is for example also possible to use ridge waveguides.<br>
It is an advantage of the invention that the communciation,<br>
for example all feed signals, can be collected in a slim<br>
waveguide as compared coaxial feeder cables which are thick<br>
and have large losses. Still further it is an advantages that<br>
the arrangement for providing communication between a base<br>
station and an antenna arrangement can be made more aesthetic<br>
and less optically dominating, than a large number of thick<br>
coaxial feeder cables. It is particularly advantageous that<br>
the arrangement can be integrated in a mounting structure, for<br>
example a mast, or in the legs of a mast structure. It is also<br>
advantageous that, through the use of waveguides for signal<br>
transmission, the losses will be very low. The losses are,<br>
even for low profile waveguides, lower than for thick coaxial<br>
cables. It is also an advantage that a waveguide arrangement,<br>
particularly one comprising a number of sections,  can be<br>
16<br><br>
easily fabricated and installed at a low cost, and it is easy<br>
to transport and resistant to damages. It is also advantageous<br>
that such a waveguide arrangement is particularly easy and<br>
cheap to fabricate and it e.g. comprises conventional extruded<br>
aluminium profiles or a material coated with aluminium.<br>
Moreover for example for 3G (3GPP, Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project) implementations frequencies which are<br>
high are used, which means that the losses get high if cables<br>
are used, it is clearly advantageous to a use waveguide<br>
arrangement instead of very thick coaxial cables.<br>
It is also advantageous that the waveguide arrangement may<br>
fabricated in sections which simply are mounted to each other<br>
by means of flanges or similar since the mounting structure is<br>
a mast, which may be very high, even up to 20-30 meter or<br>
more.<br>
It should be clear that the invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically illustrated embodiments but that it can be varied<br>
in a number of ways without departing from the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
Particularly may each waveguide in a waveguide arrangement<br>
support propagation or transmission of signals by one or more<br>
modes and the profile structure can be made with any cross-<br>
sectional shape, square-shaped, rectangular, circular,<br>
elliptic, oval etc. It should also be clear that the higher<br>
the frequency of the propagating signals is, the higher is the<br>
gain of using a waveguide arrangement.<br>
