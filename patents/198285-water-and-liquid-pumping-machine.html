				<td>Page 2 This invention relates to systems and machineries in which water (or any liquid ) pumping (lifting) is done by rotation of contlneous round (wheel) pipes and lengthy rods or partially open pipes contineously fit with water lifting wings as continuing rounds.<br>
In this system, the ( water or any liquid ) pipe is bent in contlneous round shape of equal or less dla and fit with central shaft preferably tube with connecting small rods for fitting strength.  When the central shaft ( (tube) of the machinery rotates, the contlneous  (water or any liquid) pipe also rotates.  The mouth of the pipe, when its does down on its rotation process, it passes through the to be pumped water and the water gets into the pipe and in its further rotation process when the mouth goes up, the water inside the pipe goes down and by subsequent rotations, it goes up and down,the water passes to the next end of the pipe and passes out.<br>
The contlneous round pipes will have provision of one side ( i.e. inside ) opening valves to control the water gone inside not to flow out on return way from mouth.  The water passed out by the back end will be carried by further pipes or disposed according to the<br><br><br>
To pump out more water, biggeer dla pipes could be used and at the same time, more number of pipes also could be fit for more output result. For better performance the dia of the pipe in the mouth side could be bigger and could get reduced slightly subsequently in a constant way upto the end of the pipe.  The mouth of the pipe also could be made wide for collecting more water.<br>
The machineries could be used to pump up or pump out both staggered water and flowing water.  The figure 2 shows the machinery on flowing water with more number of pipes in contineous round shape with additional small blade like items preferably in steel plates fixed on top of the pipes which will make the water force to push the pipes and rotate it fast without manual assistance and the water which goes inside through the mouths of the pipeswill come out of Jiothenends above the water level.<br>
This system would be much useful where the water flow is at low level and sidewise grounds are at height and water is needed to be pumped to the ground height.  In such machineries when the wheels rotation force is more, it could be used for producing electricity also by fitting dynamos and generators with proper provisions. This system could be used to pump up or pump out staggered water also.  In that occasion manual force or electric motors could be used for rotating the machinery.<br><br><br>
Page   4 ljf3A,4A  &amp;   4B<br>
,In the above such machineries referred in Fig 2A,jcentral<br>
shaft could be in tube form preferably strong steel tube<br>
and the pipes which are made in contineous round shape and<br>
slope in the edge could be fit with the central shaft<br>
tubes by means of rods which start from pipes and passes<br>
through the tube.  The length of the rod from pipe to<br>
shaft tube could be increased or decreased according to<br>
the need by provision of clampings on both side edges of<br>
central shaft tube.  More length will give more radius for<br>
the round pipe to rotate and the pipe mouth could go deep<br>
into the water level and lift more water and it will also<br>
be useful when the water to be pumped is from lower level.<br>
Fig 2A shows the machine mounted on walls both side. The walls can have more machine resting steps with different heights.  When the water level goes up and down the machinery could be lifted on^set on suitable step for better performance as shown in fig 2B.<br>
Instea
 <br>
fase   D<br>
For pumping water from the well, the centre shaft tube and the contlneous round pipes could be set as shown in Fig 3A. According to this system of pumMping of water, well could be perfectly dug in rectangular shape giving more length and less breadth with closer inside depth or it could be a round bottom as shown in Fig 3B.  The mouth of the contlneous round pipes could go to the depth into the water level and carry water.  The round pipes will have valves in different stages and the water which goes inside beyond the valve can come out only through the back end which is connected with the centre shaft tube.  The water comes out of the centre shaft tube could be connected with the outside pipe lines which go to the cultivation field.<br>
Again fig 4A shows a round type well.  For setting the machinery<br>
two cross bars could be kept across the well and the machinery<br>
he could set on it.  This cross bars could be strong steel tubes and<br>
the outflow of water could be through that tube also.  In Fig 4A,<br>
the out flow of water is through connected tubes as shown in the<br>
figure.<br>
The same system is applicable in pumping up the drinking water supplied in cities by Govt.agencies.  In cities, the Govt.agencies supply the drinking water but according to the height of the water tank and the land, sometimes where the land height is more, the water could flow only at particular depth.<br><br><br>
People construct cement structure below the ground level upto the depth where they could reach the drinking water pipe line.  From there they take the water by pots.  Instead of that.the water could be pumped up upto or above the ground level by the contineous round pipe system as shown in Fig 4B.<br>
Cement construction could be done in the same style.  Over that a plastic tank or steel tank made in the very same style could be k^t and fit over the cement contruction as it could be removed, cleaned and washed easily.<br>
In the same way as shown in fig 4B, the water could be pumped up ^j by using different type of contineous round pipes as shown in Fig 5A.  By this method, water could be pumped to more height and by repeating the process as shown in Fig 5B, the water could be pumped upto the roof level of high rise building.  The outlet end of the contineous round pipe will be fixed with a rubber valve which will open when it moves up above the pressing wall and pass out the water and will get closed automatically when it starts touching the pressing wall again during the downward rtotation cycle.<br>
For rotating the contineous round tubes, it could be connected by chain to the wheels which could provide rotation strength. Rotation power from roof top wind (wing) wheels could be provided and by this water could be pumped up with out the need of electric power. <br><br>
As an embodiment to this system water or	any liquid could be<br>
lifted ( pumped ) up by contineously fit	water lifting wings<br>
as continueing rounds on lengthy rods or	partially open<br>
pipes as shown in Fig 6A &amp; 7A.<br>
In fig 6A, water lifting bottom closed wings are fit in a rod.  When the rod rotates, the wings go down into the water level and by that time the water gets into the wing through its mouth and on further rotation cycle when the wing goes up, the water inside the wing gets lifted.  Again by subsequent rotation when the wings start getting down, the water inside the wings will be poured out.  When a lot of wings are cc&gt;ntinueoUSJLX   fit as continuing rounds, the process of lifting of water is quite contineous and again<br>
«:LL. „     		—,<br>
when the rod rotates fast, the lifting outflow of water is quite considerable.  The lifted outflowing water could be carried or disposed by equipments as shown in Fig 6B &amp; 6C. This machine could be mounted on the steel stand. When the to be pumped water level is much lower, the stand legs which carries the machine could also be made to widen and by this, the height comes down and the machine gets closer to the earth and water level.<br>
The Fig 7A shows the water lifting machine with bottom open wings.  The centre shaft is a half round tube inside with open top having Joint strength giving rods.  A full tube covers it as shown in the figure and the water lifting bottom open suitably bent wings are fit on it as continuing rounds. <br><br>
When the machine starts rotating, the wings will come down to the water level and lift the water.  The wings will be manufactured in such a way as shown in Fig 7C to keep the lifted water in the bend provided.  When the wing goes upto the half height, the water starts ^uring through the down open hole of the wing and before the wing comes down again, the entire water flow into the top open inside tube and it comes out through the side open as shown in fig 7A.  A model water outlet is shown in Fig 7D and a model of gear system to speed up the rotation is shown in Fig 7B. Fig 1C shows the view of water lifting bottom open wings.<br>
Fig 8 shows an another embodiment of this invention.  The water lifted and poured out by the water lifting bottom closed wings is collected by the lengthy tray like equipment provided on the other end of the in between wall and the collected water is passed out in two sides over the bladed wheels.  The force of the poured out water makes the wheel to rotate and that wheel rotation force makes the original machine to run without the need of any other additional force.  The machine could be started Initially by manual operations and subsequently it can run on its own continueously and by this system, water pumping and refilling could be done at marginal expenses.  When the rotation force is more, dynamos / generators also could be attached with the wheels by chain or belt links for producing electricity.<br>

and ascertains the nature of this Invention and<br>

i^i&gt;&gt;	contd. •   in  page  2	&gt;.  ^<br><br>
This Invention relates to system(s) and machineries in which water or any liquid pumping is done by vertical rotation of contineous round (wheel) pipes and lengthy rods or partially open pipes contineously fit with water lifting wings as continuing rounds.<br>
In this system, the (water or any liquid ) pipe is bent in contineous round shape of equal or more or less dia and fit with central shaft (preferably tube) with connecting small rods for fitting strength.  When the central shaft (tube) of the machinery rotates, the contineous pipe also rotates.  The mouth of the pipe, whenit* goes down on its vertical rotation process, it passes through the to be pumped water and the water gets into the pipe and in its further rotation process when the mouth goes up, the water inside the pipe goes down and by subsequent rotations, it goes up and down and the water passes to the next end of the pipe and passes out.<br>
The contineous round pipes.will have provision of<br>
one side ( i.e inside) opening valves to control the<br>
water gone inside not to flow out on return way from mouth.<br>
The water passes out by the back end will be<br>
carried by further pipes or disposed according to the need.<br>
Reference Fig.lA.  Fig IB shows the machine fit with electric<br>
motor. <br><br>
To pump out more water, bigger dia pipes could be used and at the same time, more number of pipes also could be fit for more output result.  For better performance, the dia of the pipe in the mouth side could be bigger and could get reduced slightly subsequently in a constant way upto the end of the pipe.  The mouth of the pipe also could be made wide for collecting more water.<br>
The machineries could be used to pump up or pump out both staggered water and flowing water.  The figure 2A shows the machinery on flowing water with more number of pipes in contineous round shape with additional small blade like projecting items preferably in steel plates fixed on top of the pipeswhich will make the water force to push the pipes and rotate it fast without manual assistance and the water<br>

which does inside through the mouths of pipes will come out of other ends above the water level.<br>
This system would be much useful where the water flow is at low level and sidewise grounds are at height and water is needed to be pumped to the ground height.  In such machineries when the wheels rotation force is more, it could be used for producing electricity also by fitting dynamos and generators with proper provisions.  This system could be used to pump up or pump out staggered water also.  In that occasion manual force or electric motors<br><br><br>
Fig 2A shows the machine mounted on walls both side. The walls can have more machine resting steps with different heights.  When the water level goes up and down, the machinery could be lifted and set on sui table/ffect\)for better performance as shown in Fig 2B.<br>
Instead of walls, the machine could be mounted on steel stands also.  When the to be pumped water level is much lower, the stand legs which carry the machine could also be made to widen and by this, the height comes down and the machine gets closer to the earth and the water level.  The last end of the pipes could be set in such a way the pipes set with in or around centre shaft tube as shown in 2D and 2E so that the outflow of the water could be perfect with out wastage and spraying over the area.<br>
In the above such machineries referred in Fig 2A, lA, 3A 4a, 4B &amp; 6 central shaft could be in tube form preferably strong steel tube and the pipes which are made in contineous<br>
"^■■i,.,	 	 	<br>
round shape and slope in the edge could be fit with the central shaft tubes by means of rods which start from pipes and passes though the tube.  The length of the rod from pipe to shaft tube could be increased or decreased according to the need by provision of clampings on both side edges of central shaft tube.  More length will give more radius for the round pipe to rotate and the pipe mouth could go deep into the water level and lift more water and it will also be useful when the water to be pumped is from lower level.<br><br><br>
For pumping water from the well ( upto limited depth only)<br>
Q the centre shaft tube and the contineous round pipes could be   f<br>
set as shown in Fig 3A.  According to this system of pumping<br>
of water, well could be perfectly dug in rectangular shape<br>
giving more length and less breadth with closer inside depth<br>
or it could be a round bottom as shown in Fig 3B.  The mouth<br>
of the contineous round pipes could go to the depth into the<br>
water level and carry water.  The round pipes will have<br>
valves in different stages and the water which goes inside<br>
beyonrtl the valve can come out only through the back end which<br>
is connected with the centre shaft tube.  The water comes out<br>
of the centre shaft tube could be connected with the outside<br>
pipe lines which go to the cultivation field.<br>
Fig 6 a shows another embodiment of contineous round pipe machine for pumping water from well.  The outlet end of the pipes are seilt with centre shaft tube and the water passes out finally through centre shaft tube.  Ball bearings used in<br>
revolving spot will reduce the friction and increase the M efficientcy of the machine.<br>
Again fig 4A shows a round type well.  For setting the<br>
machinery two cross bars could be kept across the well and the machinery could be set on it.  This cross bars could be<br>
strong steel tubes and the outflow of water could be through<br>
that tube also.  In fig 4A, the out flow of water is through<br>
connected tubes as shown in the figure.<br><br><br>
Fig 6B shows an another embodiment which could be used for pumping water from lake like place where the wall supporting strength is at one side only.  The cross bars of the machine could rest on the banks of the lake at one side and on the other side it could rest on steel frame fit with the machine.<br>
The same system is applicable in pumping up the drinking<br>
water supplied in cities by Govt.agencies•  In cities, the Govt.agencies supply the drinking water but according to the<br>
height of the water tank and the land, sometimes where the land height is more, the water could flow only at particular<br>
depth. People construct cement structure below the ground<br>
level upto the depth where they could reach the drinking<br>
water pipe line. From there they take the water by pots.<br>
Instead of that, the water could be pumped up upto or above<br>
the ground level by the contineous round pipe system as shown<br>
in Fig 4B.  Cement construction could be done in the same<br>
style. Over that a plastic tank or steel tank made in the<br>
very same style could be kept and fit over the cement<br>
construction as it could be removed, cleaned and washed<br>
easily.<br>
In the same way as shown in Fig 4B, the water could be pumped up by using different type of contineous round pipes as shown<br>
in Fig 5A.  By this method, water could be pumped to more<br>
height and by repeating the process as shown in Fig 5B, the<br>
water could be pumped upto the roof level of high rise building <br><br>
The outlet end of the contineous round pipe will be fixed with a rubber valve which will open when it moves up above the pressing wall and pass out the water and will get closed automatically when it starts touching the pressing wall again dLurlng the downward rotation cycle as shown in fig 5C (wall) fig5D,5E,5F,5G,5H &amp; 5J<br>
For rotating the contineous round tubes, it could be connected by chain to the wheels which could provide rotation strength. Rotation power from roof top wind (wing) wheels could be provided and by this water could be pumped up with out the need of electric power.<br>
This system could be applied for pumping water from the well depth to top ground height.  Same type of contineous round pipes could be made with one or two or more sets and the water from well could be pumped by installing the machine at heights above ground level,  or below ground level within the well according to the well water level and the height water to be pumped. For rotation power of the contineous round pipes chains could be used making wheels at the centre and outside or handles could be provided on top of the wheel and manually it could be operated by theWan who operates it.<br>
. .8. .<br><br><br>
As an embodiment to this system, water or any liquid could be pumped up by contineously fit water lifting (pumping) wings as continuing rounds on lengthy rods or partially open pipes as shown in Fig 7A &amp; 8A.<br>
In Fig 7A, water lifting (pumping) bottom closed wings are fit in a rod.  When the rod rotates, the wings go down into the water level and by that time the water gets into the wing through its mouth and on further rotation cycle when the wing goes up, the water inside the wing gets lifted. Again by subsequent rotation when the wings start getting down, the water inside the wings will be pured out.  When a lot of wings are contineously fit as continuing rounds, the process of lifting of water is quite contineous and again when the rod rotates fast, the lifting outflow of water is quite considerable.  The lifted outflowing water could be carried or disposed by canal like equipments as shown in Fig 7B &amp; 7C.  This machine could be mounted on the steel stand.  When the to be pumped water level is much lower, the stand legs which carries the machine could also be made to widen and by this, the height comes down and the machine gets closer to the earth and water level.<br>
The Fig 8A shows the water lifting machine with bottom open wings. The centre shaft is a half round tube inside with open top having joint strength giving rods.  A full tube covers it as shown in the figure and the water lifting bottom open suitably bent wings are fit on it as continuing rounds. <br><br>
When the machine starts rotating, the wings will come down to the water level and lift the water.  The wings will be manufactured in such a way as shown in fig 8C to keep the lifted water in the bend provided.  When the wing goes upto the half height, the water starts pouring through the down open hole of the wing and before the wing comes down again, the entire water flow into the top open inside tube and it comes out through the side open as shown in Fig 8A.<br>
The fig 8E shows the part of water outlet.  The half open tube and the covering full tube fit with contineous wings are extended further with wide outlet wings.  When the water is lifted by wings at one side and water outlet is on the opposite side and the water is poured out through wings, the weight of the water lying and pressing down in outlet wings will give lifting force for the water lifting contineous wings working on the opposite side.<br>
An another model water outlet is shown in Fig 8D and a model of gear system to speed up the rotation is shown in Fig 8B. Fig 8C shows the view of water lifting bottom open wings.<br>
Fig 9 shows an another embodiment of this invention.  The water lifted and poured out by the water lifting bottom closed wings is collected by the lengthy tray like equipment provided on the other end of the in between wall and the collected water is passed out in two sides over the bladed wheels. <br><br>
and that wheel rotation force makes the adjoining wheel to rotate and that wheel rotation force makes the original<br>
machine to run without the need of any other additional<br>
force.  The machine could be started initially by manual<br>
operations and subsequently it can run on its own	ilA  \*jr<br>

contineously and by this system, water pumping and refilling m* 'j»''<br>
could be done at marginal expenses.  When the rotation force ,fl<br>
is more, dynamos / generators also could be attached with the wheels by chain or belt links for producing electricity.<br>
Fig 10 A shows an another embodiment of the machine with longer rod and more number of water lifting wings with in-between stands.  The machine shown in Fig7A &amp; 8A could be<br>
made in this pattern to pump out more water.  Fib lOB to 10    |^<br>
show the models which could pump water resting on one or<br>
more stands of one side or one side of river, lake, well or<br>
any water lying areas with water out-let weight balancing attachment on the other side of stand.<br>
U At present water pumping is done'electric motors and the<br>
manual systems used in villages with rope and buckets and using of bullocks and pulling big drum like bucket are very<br>
old type and they do not give more output result for the<br>
labour employed.<br>
These products are new and there is no such product exists at present.  These systems are much useful because of its<br>
easy operation, volume of water pumping, low cost and operation out the needs of electricity, diesel, or other<br>
power generating liquids and the related motors.<br>
