INERTIA LOCKING SYSTEM AND COLLAPSIBLE SEAT WITH THE LOCKING SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present Invention relates to an inertia locking system in which a latch is operated by a torsion coil spring due to an inertia force so as to grip and hold a locked member when the locked member is brought into contact therewith, and an improvement of a collapsible seat provided with the inertia locking system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, as a seat for being equipped in a station wagon or the like, there is a seat which is constituted by a seat cushion 1 having a front face upward substantially C-shaped leg portion la capable of being stood on a lower stage portion surface fA of a vehicle body floor F Vn a lower portion close to a front side as shown in Fig. 1, and a seat back 2 placed so as to be tiltable by axially supporting a bracket 2a protruding from a lower portion side of the seat back 2 to an upper stage portion surface f2 of the vehicle body floor F by a supporting shaft 2b, axially supports and connects a curved arm Ib extending to a rear portion side of the seat cushion 1 to a portion close to a lower side of ei side portion of the seat back 2 by a supporting shaft Ic. and can Jump up the seat cushion<br>
1 including the leg portion la by the curved arm lb.<br>
In the collapsible seat, an inertia locking system 3 gripping and holding the leg portion la of the seat cushion 1 in a lower line of the shaft is mounted so as to be placed in the lower stage portion fi of the vehicle body floor F.<br>
The inertia locking system 3 is conventionally provided with a pedestal 31 in which a substantially U-shaped receiving port 30 receiving the leg portion la of the seat cushion (not shown) in the lower line of the shaft is open toward an obliquely upper side, a latch 32 formed in a substantially reverse-J shape from a lower base portion 32a to a curved upper portion 32b, a pivot pin 33 pivoting the latch 32 to a side portion of the pedestal 31 by the lower base portion 32a so as to direct the curved upper portion 32b of the latch 32 toward the receiving port 30 of the pedestal 31, and a torsion coil spring 34 spring biasing the latch 32 to a locking position or an unlocking position, as shown in Fig 8.<br>
In the structure, the torsion coil spring 34 fits a coil spring portion 34a onto an axis of the pivot pin 33, fastens one spring end 34b to a projection piece 35 protruding out from the side portion of the receiving table 31 at a position close to a rear side of the pivot pin 33, and fastens another spring end 34c to a projection piece 36 protruding out from an upper side of the latch 32, thereby being mounted,<br>
In the inertia locking system, in order to dissolve a troublesome in use of canceling the lock, the latch 32 is assembled so as to be supported and biased in a moving apart<br>
direction at the back of the receiving port 30 of the pedestal 31 by the torsion coil spring 34 at a normal time. On the contrary, at a time of collision or the like, the latch 32 is operated by the torsion coil spring 34 in such a manner as to move a position of center of gravity corresponding to a fastening point of the spring end 34c to a front side on the basis of an inertia force, thereby being assembled so as to grip and hold the leg portion la of the seat cushion 1 positioned within the receiving port 30 by the latch 32.<br>
In this case, in the seat provided with the seat cushion 1 capable of being Jumped up mentioned above, since an offset exists between a center of rotation given by the supporting shaft Ic and a center of gravity of the seat cushion 1, the rotational force by which the seat cushion 1 jumps up is generated, at a time when a sitting person does not exist due to the collision or the like. On the contrary, in the inertia locking system 3 mentioned above, since the latch 32 is operated<br>
after the inertia force generated by the collision or the like<br>
 is applied, a lot of time Is required until the latch 32 engages<br>
with the leg portion la of the seat cushion 1, so that there is generated a matter that the leg portion la of the seat cushion 1 can not e gripped and held by the latch 32.<br>
Further, since the latch 32 is supported so as to be biased in the moving apart direction at the back of the receiving port 30 of the pedestal 31 by the torsion coil spring 34 at the normal time, foreign materials and the like are attached around an axis of the pivot pin 33, and it can not be known in advance whether<br>
or not the latch 32 becomes in a state that it can not rotate.<br>

EMBODIMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A description will be given below of an embodiment with reference to Figs. 1 to 6. The illustrated embodiment is applied to an inertia locking system 3 preventing a seat cushion 1 from being jumped up which is provided in a collapsible seat assembled by a seat cushion 1 and a seat back 2 in the same manner as the seat in Fig. 7. In the structure, constituting parts in common with the parts shown in Fig. 7 will be described by using the same reference numerals.<br>
The collapsible seat is constituted, as shown in Fig. 1, by a seat cushion 1 provided with a front face upward substantially C-shaped leg portion la capable of being stood on a lower stage portion surface fi of a vehicle floor F in a<br>
lower portion close to a front side, and a seat back 2 placed in a tiltable manner by axially supporting a bracket 2a protruding out from a lower portion side of the seat back 2 to an upper stage portion surface fa of the vehicle body floor F by a supporting shaft 2b, and is structured such that a curved arm Ib extending to a rear portion side of the seat cushion l is axially connected to a portion close t.o. a lower side of a side portion of the seat back 2 by a supporting shaft Ic, and the set cushion 1 including the leg portion la can be jumped up by the curved arm Ib.<br>
In the structure, the leg portion la of the seat cushion 1 is formed by bending a metal round pipe in a substantially C shape directed to a front face upper side, and is provided so as to be received in a lower portion side of the seat cushion 1 by axially supporting and connecting both axial ends to both sides of the lower portion in the seat cushion 1 by a supporting shaft (not shown). As the curved arm Ib, there is placed a structure formed in a substantially reverse-L shape which is obliquely curved in correspondence\to an angle of incline of the seat back 2 from a side fixed to the side portion of the seat cushion 1 to the side portion of the seat back 2 by the supporting shaft Ic.<br>
The inertia locking system 3 is assembled, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, by a pedestal 301 in which a substantially U-shaped receiving port 300 receiving the leg portion la of the seat cushion by an axial lower line is open toward an obliquely upper side, a latch 302 formed in a substantially reverse-J side<br>
elevational shape from a Lower base portion 302a to a curved upper portion 302b, a pivot pin 303 pivoting the latch 302 to a side portion of the pedestal 301 by the lower base portion 302a so as to direct the curved upper portion 302b of the latch 302 toward the receiving port 300 of the pedestal 301, and a torsion coil spring 304 having a coil spring portion 304a fitted onto an axis of the pivot pin 303, one: spring end 304b fastened to the side portion of the pedestal 301 at a position close to a rear side of the pivot pin 303, and another spring end 304c fastened to the upper side of the latch 302.<br>
In the structure, as the latch 302. there is provided a structure having a jaw portion 302c with which the leg portion la of the seat cushion entering into the receiving port 300 of the pedestal 301 (not shown, and so forth) is brought into contact so as to kick in a state of being biased in a moving part direction at the back of the receiving port 300 of the pedestal 301 by the torsion coil spring 304, as shown in Fig. 2. In this structure, the jaw portion 302c is protruded to an<br>
inner side of a bottom line of the receiving port 300 from the<br>
lower base portion 302a. The jaw portion 302c of the latch 302<br>
forms a part of the hook gripping the leg portion la of the seat cushion by being provided so as to be continuously connected to the curved upper portion 32b by a curved surface.<br>
In the inertia locking system 3. as shown in Fig. 3, the receiving port 300 is formed by providing with a substantially U-shaped clip 305 obtained by making the open port a little narrower than a diameter of axis of t'ie metal round pipe so as<br><br>
to deflect and curve both open edges to an outer side. This clip 305 is provided by being engaged with and fixed to slits 301a and 301b of the pedestal 301 installed and fixed to the vehicle body floor F by retainer hooks 305a and 305b. The torsion coil spring 304 is provided by hooking one spring end 304b to a stop rod 306 protruding from the pedestal 301 so as to fasten and inserting and engaging another spring end 304c to a protrusion piece 302d protruding from the side portion of the latch 302 so as to fasten.<br>
In the collapsible seat provided with the inertia locking system 3 structured in the manner mentioned above, when moving the axial lower line of the leg portion la within the receiving port 300 for the purpose of placing the leg portion la of the seat cushion in a standing manner, the axial lower line of the leg portion la is at first brought into contact with the curved surface of the jaw portion 302c so eis to kick it as shown in Fig. 4 because the jaw portion 302c is positioned so as to protrude to the inner side of the bottom line of the receiving<br>
port 300 from the lower base portion 302a as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Accordingly, the latch 302 is operated so as to immediately move the position of center of gravity correisponding to the fastening point of the spring end 304c to the front side by the torsion coil spring 304 due to an inertia force of the leg portion. In accordance with the operation of the latch 302, as shown in Fig. 5, since the latch 302 grips the axial lower line of the leg portion la from the upper side by the curved upper portion 302b at the same time of receiving the leg portion la<br>
of the seat cushion in the inner portion of the receiving port 300, it is possible to lock the leg portion la of the seat cushion to the inner portion of the receiving port 300 due to an elastic pressure of the coil spring 304.<br>
On the contrary, at a time of taking out the leg portion la of the seat cushion from the inertia locking system 3, since the leg portion la of the seat cushion moves along the curved surface of the curved upper portion 302b in accordance that a passenger lifts up the seat cushion, the latch 302 is operated by the torsion coil spring 304 in such a manner as to move the position of center of gravity corresponding to the fastening point of the spring end 304c to the back side, and is automatically returned to the initial position in such a manner as to be supported in a biased manner in the moving apart direction at the back of the receiving port 300 of the pedestal 301 by the torsion coil spring 304.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to immediately lock the leg portion la so that the seat cushion does not jump up at a time<br>
of collision or the like. On the contrary, since the latch 302<br>
is together operated accompanying with attaching and detaching<br>
the leg portion la of the seat cushion, there is no troublesome matter in view of usability for canceling the lock of the inertia locking system 3 . Further, it is possible to prevent the matter that the latch 302 can not rotate due to the foreign materials attached around the axis of the pivot pin 303 from being generated.<br>
The collapsible seat mentioned above can be collapsed so<br>
as to recline the seat back 2 to the upper stage portion fz of the vehicle body floor F, overlap the seat cushion 1 on the seat back 2 and overlap the leg portion la on the bottom portion of the seat cushion 1, as shown in Pig. 6.<br>
In this case, the description is given of the embodiment mentioned above in the case that the inertia locking system 3 is provided in the collapsible seat, however, the structure is not limited to this collapsible seat, and the inertia locking system 3 can be widely applied to a mechanism for gripping and holding various kinds of locked members.<br>
In the above description, terms and expressions used in the present specification are only employed for simply describing, and do not limit the contents of the present invention. If there are used restrictive terms and expressions. they do not intend to exclude equivalent structures to the present embodiment mentioned above or a part thereof. Accordingly, various modifications can be added within the scope of the present claimed invention.<br><br><br><br>
