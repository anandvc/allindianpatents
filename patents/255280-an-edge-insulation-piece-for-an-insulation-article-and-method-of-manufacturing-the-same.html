				<td>It is an object of the present invention to provide an edge insulation that will reduce the losses from encapsulated insulating materials, such as vacuum insulating panels, and any other device, component or part that requires a thermal break. The invention can be applied to effect an improvement at any temperature difference but it is particularly effective at elevated temperatures.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an edge insulation with improved corner portions.<br>
The invention provides an edge insulation piece for an insulation article characterised in that the edge insulation piece comprises a thin sheet of material, the thin sheet of material having been manipulated to effect a long conductive path within a small cross-sectional area.<br>
Preferably the thin sheet of material may be any suitable width, from a narrow strip to a width suitable for making a long edge piece such as could form a one-piece edge insulation around an insulation panel, for example.<br>
This invention improves the thermal performance of most Vacuum Super Insulation (VSI) panels and reduces the thermal losses normally encountered at the edges and circumferences of insulating materials. It achieves this improvement by increasing the conductive length of the material between the hot and cold surfaces. A variation also incorporates thin layers of insulation sandwiched between each fold or bend in the material. This is achieved without increasing the width by any significant amount and also reduces any convective losses due to the lower average temperature of the edge. The temperature drops along the length of the sheet forming the edge piece between a hot surface and a cold surface to which the edge piece may be attached   The invention further enables the<br>
edge of such insulating materials to be able to withstand thermal expansion and additionally creates a structurally strong edge.<br>
Preferred materials include for example stainless steel for high temperature applications, aluminium foil, mild steel, glass or plastics materials which can withstand the required temperatures and pressures and are sufficiently gas impermeable for the required applications, either by treatment of the material or by coating it with a gas-impermeable layer. Potentially any material that is capable of being produced in a thin section is capable of being utilised. Ideally the lower the thermal conductivity the better, but even conductive materials can be used if they are thin enough and long enough.<br>
Preferably the thin sheet of material is manipulated by bending, shaping or otherwise deforming the thin sheet of material.<br>
Alternatively manipulation of the thin sheet of material may include forming the edge insulation piece by extruding, moulding or casting to produce the thin sheet of material in the desired configuration.<br>

Alternatively guides may be used to achieve a gradual change in form and shape. Alternatively the material may be manipulated by a combination of guides and rollers.<br>
A further problem of using any type of edge assembly is the sealing of the corners. The invention further provides an edge insulation piece comprising a comer portion, the edge insulation piece comprising a fhin sheet of material with extending portions corresponding to the corner portion and the thin sheet of material being manipulated to effect a long conductive path within a small cross-sectional area.

The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:<br>

before the material is folded.<br>
As shown in the Figures, an edge insulation piece 1 according to the invention comprises a thin sheet of material 2 which is manipulated by bending, rolling or other forming.    In one embodiment, a thin layer of insulation material 3 is interleaved between the two layers of the thin sheet of material 2, which are folded around the insulation layer 3 during forming of the edge piece 1,   A further layer of insulation material 4 may be rolled within the edge piece 1 as it is formed (as shown in Figures 3a,b and c). This interleaving of thin layers of insulation material 3,4 prevents the surfaces of the thin sheet of material 2 from touching each other and also helps to insulate the material 2 from the top and bottom panels 5,6 of a vacuum insulation panel 7 when the edge piece 1 is inserted around the edge of the panel 7.   The edge piece 1 may contact the internal insulation material 8 in the interior 9 of the panel 7.   In the embodiments illustrated, the interior 9 of the panel 7 is held under a vacuum and thus the layer of insulation material 3 is also subject to the vacuum, with the other layer 4 being open to the atmosphere 10.   The layer 4 is also subject to significant compression due to the folding processes employed in forming the edge insulation piece 1.<br>
The edge piece 1 is attached to the top and bottom panels 5,6 by suitable means such as welding or adhesive means. The panel 5 has a hot face H and the panel 6 has a cold face C and the edge insulation piece 1 serves to reduce the transference of heat across the edge region of the whole panel 7. The edge piece 1 may be formed as a continuous edging for arrangement around the edges of the panel 7 such that when the edge insulation piece 1 is positioned around the circumference of the panel 7, the end faces of the edging piece 1 will meet together and can be welded or joined together to make a complete seal around the periphery of the panel 1.<br><br>
As shown in Figures la and lb, the ends 11,12 of the edge piece 1, which are extensions of the sheet 2, may be attached to the end faces of the panels 5,6. Alternative arrangements axe shown in Figures lc,d,e,f and g. In these embodiments, the panels 5 and 6 are formed from thin sheets and the ends 5a,6a of the panels 5,6 are folded perpendicularly to the face of the panels 5,6 to form flanges. The ends 11,12 of the edge piece 1 may be attached to these flanges 5a,6a.<br>
As shown in Figures ld,e,f and g, the ends of the end pieces 11,12 may be capped by inverted 'V shapes or 'top hat' shapes lla,12a to improve the seal. These may be formed as extensions of the end pieces 11,12 (Figure id), as extensions of the flanges 5a,6a (Figure le) or as separate pieces 1 lb, 12b (Figures If and lg).<br>
The end pieces 11,12 and flanges 5a,6a may also be folded flat against the other faces of the panels 5,6 or sheet 2 to reduce the risk of damage to the edge sealing around the panel 7, provided that this does not compromise the insulation.<br>
The edge piece 1 may be further coated over part or all of its length with a low emissivity material 13 to minimise radiative losses. This layer 13 is preferably formed on the face of the sheet 2 that is directed towards the atmosphere 10, so that radiation losses to the atmosphere are reduced. Alternatively or additionally this further coating 13 may comprise a gas impermeable layer to form a gas impermeable barrier.<br>
Some of the possible alternative configurations of the edge piece 1 are shown schematically in Figures 2a,b,c,d.<br>
Figures 2a and b show embodiments with layers 3,4 of insulation between the layers of the sheet of material 2 whereas Figures 2c and d show embodiments without the layers of insulation. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that all the embodiments of the invention can be made with or without the layers of insulation between the layers of the sheet of material 2.<br>
By taking very thin material 2, bending and or rolling this, it is possible to form a small compact edge 1 with significantly reduced losses as compared to conventional edging techniques. This can be improved further by the addition of a thin insulation material 3,4 interleaved with the thin material 2, not only does this prevent the surfaces from touching but the compression of the insulating material tends to improve its insulating properties. This edging material 1 can then be bonded to the top and bottom skins 5,6 by various means most suited to their environment; stainless steel is typically welded. The provision of end portions 11,12 in the shape of inverted 'top hats' or inverted 'V's 1 la,12a can improve the seal. The edging material 1 can be produced in any length and joined at each end by a small length having no insulation, fusing of all layers together and forming an air-tight seal.<br>
A typical problem of using any type of edge assembly is the sealing of the comers and this can be accommodated using the same techniques of bending and folding. A typical example is shown in Figure 4 depicting a radiused rolled corner 40. Figure 5 indicates what the original source material 50 would look like before folding. The material 50 has two extending portions 51,52 corresponding to the corner position (40 of Figure 4). These portions 51,52 are folded and rolled as the edge piece 1 is assembled to form a radiused corner shape.    Most corner shapes can be<br>
accommodated using these folding techniques.    It is feasible that these folding techniques may have applications in other technologies.<br>
The edge 1 can be made out of any thin material suitable for the temperatures and environment encountered. Any insulation 3,4 interleaved with the thin material can be applied by way of a coating prior to manipulation or forming and because the edge material 1 is made out of one continuous piece it means it can be completely sealed, enabling vacuums to be formed and kept should they be required. This process can also be performed in reverse where the thin material 2 can be deposited onto the insulation 3,4 or any combination of this. Where high temperature differences are to be maintained then part or all of the edge material 1 can be coated with a low emissiviry material 13 to minimise radiative losses.<br>
Tests have been conducted using 50-micron (0.002 inch) stainless steel with excellent results indicating insulation properties twice as good as existing designs. For a roll of approximately 10mm x 7mm of 50 micron stainless steel with 0.5mm ceramic paper insulation, typical losses have been found to be less than 1.4 watts/m length of edge at 200°C temperature difference.<br>
In a further test, a prototype panel was made incorporating an edge piece in . accordance with the invention and tested for thermal losses. The panel was 270mm x 270mm x 9.7mm, with ceramic fibre and aluminium foil as filler. The structure of the edge piece enabled the panel to be extremely light, with the top and bottom skins of the panel being O.lmm thick and the density of the panel being only 0.55 gms/cm3. The edge piece was formed using 0.075mm stainless steel sheet formed as a roll and incorporated around the panel. The panel was evacuated to a modest vacuum of no better than 0.lmBar.   When tested with a hot face temperature of 322°C and a cold<br>
face temperature of 51°C, with an ambient temperature of 35°C, the panel demonstrated a thermal conductivity value of about 3.3mW/mK.<br>
It is believed that significant improvements can be made on these initial results.<br>
An edge insulation piece in accordance with the invention has the advantage that it enables the conductive path between the faces of an insulation panel to be increased without increasing the distance between the panels. The invention has the additional advantage that it also enables the edge insulation piece on an insulation panel to allow for thermal expansion movements of the panel to be accommodated within the structure of the edge insulation piece itself.<br>
Although the improvements are aimed primarily at Vacuum Super Insulation panels the invention can be applied to all other applications where a temperature difference is to be maintained or otherwise controlled and it can be applied to all shapes and sizes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
