This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-025123 filed on February 5, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a body frame of a straddle-type<br>
vehicle such as a motorcycle, for example.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
As a rear frame of a motorcycle, there has been proposed<br>
a structure in which a seat rail extends substantially<br>
horizontally from an upper part of a rear end of a main frame<br>
toward the rear side, and a backstay extends from a lower part<br>
of the rear end of the main frame toward the rear side obliquely<br>
upward. In this structure, an upper end of the backstay is<br>
faced to a part closer to a rear end of the seat rail to carry<br>
out welding at the part. Such a structure is disclosed in<br>
JP-A-05-262269.<br>
It is effective to make an area of welding of the backstay<br>
and the seat rail large in order to improve strength in<br>
connection therebetween. As means for the above, it has been<br>
considered that predetermined areas of the backstay and the<br>
seat rail are faced to each other along the longitudinal<br>
direction to carry out welding for the facing areas. The<br>
1<br><br>
backstay 100 and the seat rail 101 both have been formed from<br>
circular pipes. Accordingly, an angle of opening sideward<br>
between the both of the above has been large, so that a torch<br>
for welding has comparatively easily entered a close part of<br>
the center of the facing areas, as shown in Fig. 7. In the<br>
case, however, that a square pipe is to be used for any one<br>
of the backstay 100 and the seat rail 101 in accordance with<br>
a request in designing, for example, the angle of opening<br>
sideward between the both of the above becomes small, as shown<br>
in Fig. 8, so that a torch for welding is difficult to enter.<br>
This causes the related connection form not to be capable of<br>
easily satisfying such a request in design.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is completed in view of the above situation.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a body frame formed<br>
from pipes, which are faced to each other along the longitudinal<br>
direction to be easily welded.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, according to a first<br>
aspect of the invention, there is provided a vehicle body frame<br>
including: a first pipe extending along an axial direction and<br>
including a curved surface part having an arc-shaped cross<br>
section in a direction crossing at right angles with the axial<br>
direction; a second pipe extending along the axial direction,<br>
faced to the curved surface part along a longitudinal direction<br>
2<br><br>
and including a projecting part projectingly provided along<br>
the longitudinal direction at a position offset outward in a<br>
width direction with respect to a center line extending<br>
downward from the curved surface part along the facing<br>
direction; and a welding part for welding outer surfaces of<br>
the curved surface part and the projecting part.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, wherein:<br>
the first pipe is a circular pipe; the second pipe is formed<br>
from a base material formed from a square pipe having the width<br>
substantially equal to an outer diameter of the first pipe,<br>
the second pipe having a concave groove formed on a surface<br>
facing the first pipe along the longitudinal direction so as<br>
to include a center part in the width direction; and the<br>
projecting part is formed at a position offset in the width<br>
direction with respect to the center of the concave groove.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention,, the<br>
projecting part is formed into a pair on the both sides of the<br>
concave groove in the width direction.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, the<br>
concave groove is formed so as to be able to hold a space for<br>
draining between the concave groove and an outer surface of<br>
the first pipe.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention, wherein:<br>
the first and second pipes are provided into a pair on the both<br>
sides in a width direction of a vehicle body along the<br>
3<br><br>
longitudinal direction so that the pair would be formed from<br>
the first and second pipes; and one of both of the first and<br>
second pipes is a seat rail for supporting a seat.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the invention, wherein:<br>
the first pipe is a seat rail having one end connected to a<br>
part close to an upper end of a rear part of a main frame for<br>
a motorcycle and the other end extending substantially<br>
horizontally rearward; the second pipe is a backstay having<br>
one end connected to a part close to a lower part of the rear<br>
part of the main frame and the other end extending obliquely<br>
upward toward a rear side; a bent part is formed at the other<br>
end of the second pipe, the bent part being faced to the other<br>
end of the first pipe along the longitudinal direction; and<br>
the welding part is provided between the projecting part formed<br>
in the bent part and an outer surface on the other end side<br>
of the first pipe.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the invention, a glove<br>
bar is bridged over the both rear ends of a pair of the seat<br>
rails.<br>
According to an eight aspect of the invention, wherein:<br>
a support bracket for mounting the glove bar is provided at<br>
the rear end of the seat rail; and the support bracket is<br>
arranged so that at least a part thereof would overlap in the<br>
longitudinal direction with an area of connection of the seat<br>
rail and the bent part.<br>
4<br><br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, plural<br>
pipes are faced to each other over a predetermined length for<br>
welding. Accordingly, sufficient connection strength can be<br>
achieved even when no bracket for connection or the like is<br>
provided unlike a case of connecting an end of a pipe. Further,<br>
in the case that a circular pipe or a square pipe, for example,<br>
is faced to a pipe having a curved surface part like the first<br>
pipe along the longitudinal direction, a connection part of<br>
the both pipes is at a position just under a center axis of<br>
the first pipe, so that a welding device cannot easily reach<br>
the connection part even when it approaches from a side of the<br>
pipe. In accordance with the invention, however, the<br>
projecting part is provided at a position offset in the width<br>
direction with respect to the center axis of the curved surface<br>
part of the second pipe. This causes the connection part of<br>
the both pipes to be located closely to: the outer side, and<br>
thereby, a welding device can approach the connection part.<br>
This allows a stable welding state to be achieved.<br>
In accordance with the second aspect of the invention,<br>
the body frame can be formed by connection of pipe materials<br>
having different cross sections. Further, performing a<br>
pressing operation so that the center part of the square pipe<br>
would be included allows a part offset in position in the width<br>
direction with respect to the concave groove to be relatively<br>
projected to form a projecting part. Accordingly, the<br>
5<br><br>
projecting part can be formed in a simple process.<br>
In accordance with the third aspect of the invention,<br>
there are two welding parts inside and outside the concave<br>
groove. This allows the connection strength to be improved.<br>
In accordance with the fourth aspect of the invention,<br>
the concave groove can be used as a space for drain as it is.<br>
Accordingly, the rinse liquid or the like, for example, can<br>
be prevented from remaining between the both pipes.<br>
In accordance with the fifth aspect of the invention,<br>
two of the first and second pipes can be stably welded. This<br>
allows sufficient supporting strength to be secured for the<br>
seat.<br>
In accordance with the sixth aspect of the invention,<br>
a bent part is formed to be welded being faced to the first<br>
pipe along the longitudinal direction in connecting an end of<br>
the seat rail extending, substantially horizontally rearward<br>
from the upper part of the main frame and an end of the backstay<br>
extending obliquely upward toward the rear side from the lower<br>
part of the main frame, differently from a usual case in which<br>
a bracket for connection is provided at an end of the backstay<br>
to carry out connection with the seat rail. Accordingly,<br>
sufficient connection strength can be achieved without using<br>
a bracket.<br>
In accordance with the seventh aspect of the invention,<br>
the glove bar can be mounted in the vicinity of the connection<br>
6<br><br>
part of the pipes. This allows force operated on the glove<br>
bar to be certainly received.<br>
In accordance with the eighth aspect of the invention,<br>
a support bracket for mounting the glove bar is provided so<br>
as to overlap in the longitudinal direction with an area of<br>
connection of the seat rail and the backstay. Accordingly,<br>
it is possible to surely resist an external force from a fellow<br>
passenger holding the glove bar even when the external force<br>
operates.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><embodiment><br>
Embodiment 1 of the invention will be described, with<br>
reference to Figs. 1 to 3. Fig. 1 shows a whole motorcycle<br>
to which the invention is applied. A body frame of the<br>
motorcycle includes a head pipe 1 and a pair of right and left<br>
main frames 2 for supporting an engine. A pair of right and<br>
left seat rails 3 extends rearward from upper ends of rear parts<br>
of the main frames 2, respectively. A bracket 15 for<br>
connection is provided between a front end of the seat rail<br>
3	and the main frame 2. Both of the seat rail 3 and the main<br>
frame 2 are fixed to each other by welding via the bracket 15.<br>
The seat rail 3 (corresponding to a first pipe in the<br>
invention) is formed from a circular pipe, which is used as<br>
a base material. The seat rail 3 extends substantially<br>
horizontally from a place of the above-mentioned connection<br>
with the main frame 2, and then, bends slightly obliquely upward<br>
from a middle part thereof. On a side closer to the front ends<br>
of the both seat rails 3, projectingly formed are front side<br>
seat brackets 5 for fixing a front part of a seat 4. Further,<br>
a rear side seat bracket 6 for fixing a rear part of the seat<br>
4	is bridged over rear ends of the both seat rails 3.<br>
8<br><br>
On the other hand, respective one ends of the pair of<br>
right and left backstays 7 (corresponding to a second pipe in<br>
the invention) are connected to parts closer to the lower parts<br>
of the rear parts of the both main frames 2. The backstays<br>
7 extend obliquely rearward from an end of the connection with<br>
the main frame 2. The backstay 7 is formed from a square pipe,<br>
which is used as a base material. A front end of the backstay<br>
7 is fixed to the main frame 2 by welding. A rear end of the<br>
backstay 7 bends on the slightly rear side of the rear seat<br>
bracket 6 to form a bent part 8 facing the rear end of the seat<br>
rail 3 along the longitudinal direction. The backstay 7 is<br>
connected to the seat rail 3 at the bent part 8 as described<br>
below.<br>
In Fig. 3, the both of the above are enlarged at the<br>
connection part. As shown in Fig. 3, the seat rail 3 and the<br>
backstay 7 are formed into the substantially same size in outer<br>
width and faced to each other with the respective center<br>
positions being accorded with each other in a perpendicular<br>
direction (refer to a center line C with respect to the width<br>
directions of the seat rail 3 and the backstay 7, which is shown<br>
in Fig. 3).<br>
By the way, the connection between the seat rail 3 and<br>
the backstay 7 is a connection between two kinds of pipes having<br>
different cross sections such as a square pipe and a circular<br>
pipe. Accordingly, at a part where the both of the above are<br>
9<br><br>
faced, a circumferential surface of the seat rail 3 forms a<br>
curved surface R while that of the backstay 7 forms a flat part.<br>
It has been mentioned already, however, that an angle of opening<br>
sideward between the curved surface R and the flat part is<br>
narrow as shown in Fig. 8 and a welding torch is difficult to<br>
enter the center part of the facing part when the curved surface<br>
R is welded to the backstay 7 with the circumferential surface<br>
of the backstay 7 remaining to be a flat surface. Therefore,<br>
in Embodiment 1, a concave groove 9 is formed at a center part<br>
of the flat part in the width direction by press-processing<br>
along the longitudinal direction to make the both sides of the<br>
concave groove 9 in the width direction relatively project,<br>
and thus, a pair of projecting parts 10 are formed. This allows<br>
the seat rail 3 to be in contact with and supported on the both<br>
projecting parts 10 in the longitudinal direction at a place<br>
offset inward or outward in the width direction with respect<br>
to the center line C. Welding is performed at the contacted<br>
and supported part (a welding part 11) as described above, so<br>
that the connection between the seat rail 3 and the bent part<br>
8 of the backstay 7 is made possible.<br>
On the other hand, the concave groove 9 is formed so that<br>
a bottom surface thereof would curve. A curvature of the<br>
concave groove is arranged to be larger than that of a curved<br>
surface part R of the seat rail 3. Accordingly, a gap is held<br>
along the longitudinal direction between the bottom surface<br>
10<br><br>
of the concave groove 9 and an outer surface of the curved<br>
surface part R of the seat rail 3. The gap is opened in the<br>
back-and-forth direction and functions as a drain for draining<br>
a rinse liquid when the whole body frame is rinsed before<br>
painting.<br>
The rear ends of the seat rails 3 project further rearward<br>
from the rear ends of the backstays 7 to form projections 12,<br>
respectively. A support bracket 14 is fixed to an upper<br>
surface of the seat rail 3 on a rear end. A glove bar 14 is<br>
mounted by means of the support bracket 14. The support<br>
bracket 14 is provided over the length to the projected part<br>
so as to overlap with the above-mentioned welding part 11 in<br>
the longitudinal direction.<br>
The rear ends of the backstays 7 and those of the seat<br>
rails 3 are not arranged in line and only the rear ends of the<br>
seat rails 3 project in Embodiment 1. This is because a space<br>
for providing components having the height equal to that of<br>
two pipes cannot be secured at a rear end of the motorcycle<br>
due to the structure thereof. Accordingly, it is possible,<br>
of course, to arrange the rear ends of the seat rails 3 and<br>
the backstays 7 in line in the case that a sufficient space<br>
can be secured.<br>
Now, concretely described will be an operation and an<br>
effect of Embodiment 1 having the structure described above.<br>
In forming the body frame, the front ends of the seat rails<br>
11<br><br>
3 and the backstays 7 are connected by welding or the like<br>
respectively to the upper and lower parts of the rear part of<br>
the main frame 2. When the rear end of the seat rail 3 is faced<br>
to the bent part 8 of the backstay 7 along the longitudinal<br>
direction so that the respective centers thereof would be in<br>
line in the perpendicular direction, the seat rail 3 is in<br>
contact with and supported on an inner surface of both of the<br>
projecting parts 10 of the backstay 7, the inner surface close<br>
to the tops of the projecting parts 10, in the longitudinal<br>
direction, as shown in Fig. 3. Under such a condition, an outer<br>
surface of the seat rail 3 is welded to an outer surface of<br>
the backstay 7 along a peripheral contact part of both of the<br>
above. At that time, the welding part 11 is located at a<br>
position offset inward or outward in the width direction with<br>
respect to the center line C of the seat rail 3 and the backstay<br>
7, so that a welding, torch is not required to deeply enter<br>
between the seat rail 3 and the backstay 7. This allows a<br>
welding operation to be easily performed. Further, providing<br>
a pair of the projecting parts 10 on the both sides in the width<br>
direction allows the welding part 11 also to be arranged<br>
symmetrically with respect to the center line C. Accordingly,<br>
strength of connection between the seat rail 3 and the backstay<br>
7 can be improved with a good balance.<br>
After completing a welding process as described above,<br>
the body frame is transmitted to a rinse process for removing<br>
12<br><br>
grease, and then, transmitted to a drying process. The rinse<br>
liquid poured in the rinse process is drained through the<br>
concave groove 9. This allows a residue of the rinse liquid<br>
to be prevented from remaining in a subsequent painting<br>
process.<br>
As described above, in accordance with Embodiment 1, a<br>
pair of projecting parts 10 are provided in the backstay 7 so<br>
as to be offset in the width direction with respect to the center<br>
line C in connecting the facing part of the seat rail 3 formed<br>
from a circular pipe and the backstay 7 formed from a square<br>
pipe. Accordingly, a welding operation can be easily carried<br>
out. Moreover, forming the bent part 8 in the backstay 7 so<br>
that a predetermined length of the bent part 8 would be faced<br>
to the seat rail 3 for welding allows a certain length of the<br>
welding part 11 to be secured to achieve predetermined strength<br>
of connection. Additionally, the rinse liquid can be drained,<br>
through the concave groove 9 provided at the center part of<br>
the backstay 7 in the longitudinal direction, so that no rinse<br>
liquid remains between the seat rail 3 and the backstay 7.<br>
Furthermore, the support bracket 14 for mounting the glove bar<br>
13 is provided so that a part of the support bracket 14 would<br>
overlap in the longitudinal direction with a welding area, that<br>
is, a connection area between the seat rail 3 and the backstay<br>
7. This allows the pulling force or pushing force operated<br>
on the glove bar 13 by a tandem rider to be received in a double<br>
13<br><br>
structural part. Therefore, achieved can be an effect of<br>
certainly resisting such a force.<br><other embodiments><br>
The invention is not limited to Embodiment 1 described<br>
in the above description and drawings. The following<br>
embodiments, for example, are also included in a technical<br>
range of the invention. Further, various modifications can<br>
be carried out within a range not deviating from the spirit<br>
of the invention other than the following description.<br>
(1)	The number of the first and second pipes is not<br>
limited to the case of Embodiment 1. A mode in which second<br>
pipes P2 are connected on the both sides of a first pipe PI<br>
(refer to Fig. 4) and a mode in which the first pipes PI are<br>
connected on the both sides of the second pipe P2 contrary to<br>
the above (refer to Fig. 5) can be considered, for example.<br>
A structure in common with Embodiment 1 is marked with the same<br>
signs and references and the description is omitted.<br>
(2)	Further, one pipe is not necessarily provided so as<br>
to sandwich the other pipe and may be provided at a position<br>
offset in a circumferential direction by a predetermined angle,<br>
for example (refer to Fig. 6) .<br>
(3)	The projecting part 10 is only required to be offset<br>
to an outer side (or an inner side) in the width direction with<br>
respect to at least a center axis of the curved surface part.<br>
The projecting part 10 is not necessarily provided on the both<br>
14<br><br>
sides so as to form a pair, as in Embodiment 1.<br>
(4) The outer diameters of the first and second pipes<br>
are not limited. That is to say, in the case that the second<br>
pipe is a square pipe sufficiently wider than the first pipe,<br>
for example, it is possible to provide plural first pipes on<br>
a flat surface part of the second pipe in parallel to carry<br>
out welding.<br>

the width direction with respect to the center of the concave<br>
groove.<br>
3.	The vehicle body frame as claimed in Claim 2,<br>
wherein the projecting part is formed into a pair on the both<br>
sides of the concave groove in the width direction.<br>
4.	The vehicle body frame as claimed in Claim 3,<br>
wherein the concave groove is formed so as to be able to hold<br>
a space for draining between the concave groove and an outer<br>
surface of the first pipe.<br>
5.	The vehicle body frame as claimed in Claim 1,<br>
wherein:<br>
the first and second pipes are provided into a pair on<br>
the both sides in a width direction of a vehicle body along<br>
the longitudinal direction so that the pair would be formed<br>
from the first and second pipes; and<br>
one of both of the first and second pipes is a seat rail<br>
for supporting a seat.<br>
6.	The vehicle body frame as claimed in Claim 5,<br>
wherein:<br>
the first pipe is a seat rail having one end connected<br>
to a part close to an upper end of a rear part of a main frame<br>
17<br><br>
for a motorcycle and the other end extending substantially<br>
horizontally rearward;<br>
the second pipe is a backstay having one end connected<br>
to a part close to a lower part of the rear part of the main<br>
frame and the other end extending obliquely upward toward a<br>
rear side;<br>
a bent part is formed at the other end of the second pipe,<br>
the bent part being faced to the other end of the first pipe<br>
along the longitudinal direction; and<br>
the welding part is provided between the projecting part<br>
formed in the bent part and an outer surface of the other end<br>
of the first pipe.<br>
7.	The vehicle body frame as claimed in Claim 6,<br>
wherein a glove bar is bridged over the both rear ends of a<br>
pair of the seat rails.<br>
8.	The vehicle body frame as claimed in Claim 7,<br>
wherein:<br>
a support bracket for mounting the glove bar is provided<br>
at the rear end of the seat rail; and<br>
the support bracket is arranged so that at least a part<br>
thereof would overlap in the longitudinal direction with an<br>
area of connection of the seat rail and the bent part.<br>
18<br><br>
A seat rail formed from a circular pipe extends<br>
substantially horizontally rearward from an upper part of a<br>
rear end of a main frame. From a position closer to a lower<br>
part of the rear end, a backstay formed from a square pipe<br>
extends obliquely upward toward the rear side. At a rear end<br>
of the backstay, formed is a bent part so as to face the seat<br>
rail in the longitudinal direction. In the facing part, an<br>
upper surface of the backstay undergoes a concave process to<br>
form a drain at the center part thereof by a pressing operation<br>
so that projecting parts would be relatively formed on the both<br>
sides of a concave groove. The projecting parts are offset<br>
inward or outward in the width direction with respect to a<br>
center line C of the seat rail and the backstay. This allows<br>
the both of the seat rail and the backstay to be easily welded.</other></embodiment></td>
