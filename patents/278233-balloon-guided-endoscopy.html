In another specific embodiment, useful for large intestine endoscopy, the balloon diameter when fully inflated is six centimeters. Preferably, inflation of the balloon 116 to a diameter less than six centimeters may be achieved using relatively low pressure, such as hi the range of 30-70 milibars.<br>
It is appreciated that in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention which is particularly useful for in vivo inspection of a generally tubular body portion having a variable cross-sectional diameter, the expansion range of the diameter of balloon 116 is larger than the maximum cross-sectional diameter of the generally tubular body portion, thereby enabling engagement of expanded balloon 116 with the ulterior surface of the generally tubular body portion, and anchoring of the endoscope tool 110 thereto. Preferably, balloon 116 is a relatively soft, highly compliant balloon, operative to at least partially conform to the shape of the. interior surface of the generally tubular body portion when in engagement therewith.<br>
It is appreciated that balloon 116 may be formed of well-known stretchable materials such as latex, flexible silicon, or highly flexible nylon. Alternatively, balloon 116 may be formed of polyurethane, which is less stretchable and conforming than latex, flexible silicon or highly flexible nylon. Preferably, the diameter of balloon 116 is sufficient to ensure tight anchoring at any location in the generally tubular body portion. As seen in Fig. 1, the endoscope tool 110 preferably includes a balloon inflation/deflation control interface 122 which communicates with guiding tube 112 at a proximal portion 123 thereof which extends outwardly of a proximal end 124 of external tube 108 and governs inflation and deflation of balloon 116.
