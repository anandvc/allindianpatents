DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a signer produces a certificate signed with recovery. Signatures not signed with recovery, as are well known in the art, are also termed herein "regular signatures" or "regular as&gt;'mmetric signatures".<br>
To produce a regular asymmetric signature of a certificate C, the signer computes a signature S as follows:<br>
S =f[h(C),D)<br>
where:<br>
f is a publicly known function;<br>
h is a publicly known hash function; and<br>
D is the private key of the signer.<br>
The signed certificate is C // S, where "//" denotes concatenation.<br>
The verifier verifies that:<br>
g(S,E) = h(C)<br>
where:<br>
g is a publicly known function; and<br>
E is the public key of the signer.<br>
Preferably,/ g, D, E are chosen as follows:<br>
1.  A set M of permitted cleartexts is defined; function/defined on<br>
the set M.<br>
2.	g(y,E) is the inverse off(x,D), i.e. for any xeM g(f(x,D),E) = x.<br>
3.	g,f,E are public.<br>
4.	It is difficult to find D based only on E.<br>
5.	h is chosen such that it is difficult to find different x, y such that h(x) = h(y). A non4imiting example of an appropriate choice for h is SHA-1, which is described in FIPS PUB 180-1, published 17 April 1995 and entitled "Secure Hash Standard", available on the Internet at: www.itljaist.gov/fipspubs/fipl80-l.htm.<br>
The following is a non-limiting specific example of appropriate choices for/ g,D,E:<br>
8<br><br>
Let N=pq - an RSA number, that is, a product of two primes; let M be the set of all integers from 0 to N-l;<br>
let e, d be arbitrary integers such that ed = 1 modulo (p(N), (p(N)<br>
being Euler's totient function;<br>
let E be an ordered pair <n>; let D be an ordered pair <n>; let:<br>
g(y,E) = ye modulo N-, and<br>
let:<br>
f(x,D)- =-x-modulo K-<br>
For signature with recovery the signer ensures that C has some<br>
redundancy in it, or adds such a redundancy. The term "redundancy", as used throughout the present specification and claims, refers to a condition P(C) that holds for a random C with a very small probability. For example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the payload may be padded with a sufficiently long constant bit string, or preferably with any appropriate type of pa3'load checksum, such types of checksum being well known in the art. The signer then computes:<br>
S=f(C,D)<br>
where £ is the certificate signed with recovery.<br>
The verifier first recovers C from S:<br>
C = g(S,E)<br>
and then verifies that Chas the pre-defined redundancy.<br>
Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, when using signature with recovery, signed certificates are shorter than certificates produced with regular signature. On the other hand, unlike regular signature, signature with recovery imposes a limitation on the length of C, because the set M is limited. For example, in the particular example of RSA described above, only numbers less than the modulus N may be signed with recovery. Therefore, in a certificate for B signed by A there may not be enough space in C for the public key of B and for<br>
9<br><br>
other data; in particular, there will not be enough space in a common case where the keys of A and of B are of the same length.<br>
In order to save space and make signature with recovery more<br>
efficient and in order to overcome the limitations mentioned above, the public key<br>
(and optionally other data) may be compressed. While data may be compressed using standard compression algorithms well known in the art, in many asymmetric algorithms the public keys generated in standard ways have high entropy. As is well known in the art, information having high entropy can not be compressed, and therefore public keys generated in standard ways can not be compressed.<br>
The following method may be used for generation of compressible public-keys;<br>
1.	Choose an arbitrary seed s.<br>
2.	Generate a key pair (E,D) in such a way that:<br>
E=F(s,t)<br>
where F is a publicly known function and t is some data.<br>
For example, t may be some portion of the bits of E (such as, for example, the least significant half of E, the most significant half of E, or bits in positions scattered over E).<br>
Any appropriate value s may be used.<br>
Function F is preferably chosen to be a function that.<br>
1.	expands s pseudo-randomly to a pre-defined number of bits,<br>
similarly to the function of the function R described below; and<br>
2.	combines the expanded 5 with t in a pre-defined way (such as, for<br>
example, using the expanded s as the least significant part of the result of the<br>
combining, while using t as the most significant part, or vice versa; or in some<br>
interleaving fashion).<br>
Instead of E, the certificate preferably includes s // t, which is shorter than E.<br>
A particular choice of the function F, the method of generation of a suitable key pair, and the amount of space which is saved depend on the<br>
asymmetric algorithm which is used.<br>
10<br><br>
Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a certificate typically includes: credentials; characteristics; and a public key, signed all together. All the certificate fields, besides the public key, are referred to herein as "data". When one<br>
uses signature with recovery, the recovery process performs only recovery, but does not verify that the person who created the certificate knew the private key. In order to verify that the person who created the certificate knew the private key, it is necessary to have some redundancy in the clear text; that is, some pre-defined condition regarding the recovered message must be met, which condition has a sufficiently low probability for a random bit string. One option is to use a sufficiently long field (say, 16 bytes) with a fixed value. Another option is to use a checksum,-or a-hash, -of-the data. –Unfortunately,-both-options require-an-additional field, so that less bytes are left for a useful payload.<br>
To save more space, the seed s may be used as redundancy, if we set:<br>
s = H(data)<br>
where H is a publicly known function. Thus, space is saved by double use of s, both as the checksum / hash of the data, and as a seed as described above.<br>
Alternatively, the data itself, with some redundancy added, may be used as a seed s.<br>
The following discussion describes a certain particularly detailed preferred implementation of the present invention, useful if the well-known prior art RSA signature scheme is used. The RSA signature scheme is described, for example, in R L. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L.M.Adelman, "A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems", Communications of the ACM, 21 (1978), 120-126. RSA is used by way of example only and is not meant to be limiting.<br>
If RSA is used for signature, the public key comprises a modulus and a public exponent The limitations on the public exponent are quite loose. In particular, the public exponent may be chosen to be a fixed publicly known number that does not to have to be explicitly included into the certificate, so there<br>
is no problem with compression of the public exponent RSA modulus compression is believed to save about half of the length of the RSA modulus.<br>
II<br><br>
Several compression techniques for the RSA modulus are now described. For purposes of the following description, by way of example only and without hmiting the generality of the present invention, suppose that 2«-bit RSA<br>
moduli of the form N=pqare used, where;p and q are primes having n -x and n<br>
+ x bits, respectively; the seed s has y bits; and R is a publicly known function that expands the seed stem + x - z bits, where z is a parameter described below. The function R may, for example, comprise a suitable pseudo-random number generator that receives a seed s and expands it to a pseudo-random sequence. For example, the function R may set:<br><br>
s1=h(s), si+1=h(Si), R(s) = s1 || s2<br><br>
Sn<br><br>
where h comprises an appropriate hash function (for example SHA1, which is described in FIPS PUB 180-1, published 17 April 1995 and entitled "Secure Hash Standard", available on the Internet at: www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fipl80-l.htm; and in RFC 3174, published September 2001 and entitled "US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1), available on the Internet at: www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3174.txt?number=3174), or E(x) XOR x, where E is encryption with a block cipher (for example AES - FIPS Publication 197, November 26, 2001, Announcing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) available on the Internet at csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fipsl97/fips-197.paf).<br>
First, consider "expansion of the most significant half. The following method generates a compressible RSA key:<br>
1.	Generate an arbitrary (n - x) -bit prime p and a v-bit seed s.<br>
Methods for generating such a prime are well known in the art. In general, such<br>
methods (which are described, for example, in Handbook of Applied<br>
Cryptography by Alfred J.Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A.Vanstone,<br>
section 4.2 "Probabilistic Primality Tests") involve generating an arbitrary number<br>
having the required number of bits; testing for primality using a suitable primality<br>
test (such as Fermat's test, the Solovay-Strassen test, or the Miller-Rabin test,<br>
described in section 4.2 of Handbook of Applied Cryptography, referred to above);<br>
and, if the number is not prime, repeating the generating and testing until a prime<br>
number is found.<br>
2.	Set<br>
12<br><br>
No=R(s)*2n-x+z,q=No/p<br>
rounded up to an odd integer. The most significant bit of R(s) must be forced to 1, by setting the most significant bit of R(s) to 1 even if the function R produces a 0<br>
for the most significant bit.<br>
3.	Check q for primality, using a suitable primality test, as<br>
discussed in step 1 above. If failure (q is not prime), set q = q+2 and repeat the<br>
present step. If success {q is prime), continue to the next step.<br>
4.	Check if the n+x-z most significant bits of N = pq are R(s). If<br>
not, repeat the method from the beginning (from step 1). If yes, N is the modulus.<br>
In compressed form, the n+x-z most significant bits are replaced with the seed 5,<br>
so the length of the compressed modulus is n-x+z+y bits.<br>
To make the probability of success on step 4 reasonably close to 1, z<br>
must be a little more than log2(n), since it is known from number theory that the density of primes around N is proportional to 1/ln N, which means that a search for a prime number will succeed after c In N steps in average, where c is some constant. For example, for a reasonable setting of n=1024 (2048-bit modulus), with .T = z = 16y = 96, the length of the compressed modulus is n-x+z+y = 1120 bits.<br>
Now, consider "expansion of the least significant half. The following method generates a compressible RSA key:<br>
1.	Generate an arbitrary (n-x)-hit prime p and a ,v-bit seed J.<br>
Compute:<br>
q = 2"™ +(R(s)/p modulo 2™-z)<br>
The least significant bit of R(s) must be forced to 1, which means Xha.tR(s) is odd.<br><br>
Since p is odd, it is invertible modulo                        exists and is odd.<br>
3.	Check q for primality. If failure, set<br><br>
and repeat the present step. If success, continue to the next step.<br>
4.	Check if N has exactly 2n bits. If not, repeat from the beginning<br>
of the present method, at step 1. If yes, AT is the modulus. In compressed form, the<br>
13<br><br>
n+x-z least significant bits are replaced with the seed s, so the length of the compressed modulus is n=x+z+y bits.<br>
The same settings mentioned above in the case of expansion of the most significant half may preferably be used.<br>
Instead of R{s) being the n+x-z most significant or least significant bits of N as described above, it is possible to scatter the bits of R(s) over N. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a preferred method for generation of such N may be based on the LLL (Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovasz) algorithm (described, for example, in Handbook of Applied Cryptography, referred to above, at section 3.10.1). The LLL algorithm is also termed herein-the-"LLL-method'-<br>
A method in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, for scattering the bits of R(s) over N, using a particular application of the LLL dgorithm, is now described.<br>
Consider the following definitions:<br>
-	A pattern P is a string of 2n symbols from the alphabet {0,1, ?}.<br>
We'll say that a 2n-bit number N matches pattern P if and only if for every 0 in P<br>
there is 0 in the corresponding position of N, and for every / in P there is / in the<br>
corresponding position of N.<br>
-	A generalized pattern G is a string of 2n symbols from the<br>
alphabet;{*,}<br>
-	A pattern P is an instantiation of a generalized pattern G if and<br>
only if for every symbol "? " in G there is "? " in the corresponding position of P. Let G be a generalized pattern. Suppose that all the symbols "*" in<br>
G form k contiguous sequences. For any<br>
i, 1 <i></i>
the i-th sequence starts from position<br>
Si<br>
and contains<br>
14<br><br>
symbols "*". Positions are numbered from 0 (the least significant) to 2n-l (the most significant).<br>
It is possible to assume that<br>
(that is, the sequences are listed from the most significant part to the least significant).<br>
In accordance with a preferred embociment of the present invention, the following method generates a compressible RSA key for a given generalized pattern G that contains exactly n+x-z symbols " * ":<br>
1.	Generate an arbitrary (n-x)-bit prime p and a y-bit seed s, as<br>
described above.<br>
2.	Create an instantiation P of G by replacing all symbols "*" with<br>
bits of R(s), in the same order. Let<br>
be the<br><br>
sequence of bits, read as a number, that have replaced the z-th sequence of symbols<br>
3.	Build a lattice in (k+2)-dimensional space, with base vectors<br><br>
as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
4.	Using the LLL algorithm, find another base<br>
w1,w2,...,wk+2<br>

considered "short" if x12+x22+...+;*;„" is small. Persons skilled m the art will appreciate that the LLL algorithm is intended to find vectors that are close to the shortest ones in the lattice.<br>
5.	Verify that the (k+2)-th coordinate is not equal to zero for only-<br>
one vector from the new base, and for that vector it is equal to<br>

If this condition is not satisfied, repeat from the beginning of the present method (from step 1)<br>

be the vector whose (k+2)-th coordinate is not equal to zero, and be the (k+l)-th coordinate of the vector<br>
7. Compute<br>

Verify that pq matches the pattern P. If yes, check q for primality. If q is prime, N =pq is the modulus. If not, or if pq does not match the pattern, try another linear combination. If the search failed, repeat from the beginning of the present method (from step 1)<br>
The inventors of the present invention believe that scattering of the expanded part has at least the following advantages, compared with expansion of the most significant or least significant bits:<br>
1.	Less Regular Structure of the Modulus<br>
In case that R(s) has some regular structure, cryptographic attacks based on R(s) are less likely if bits of R(s) are scattered. An important special case in which scattering the bits is likely to be helpful in making cryptographic attack less likely is when data itself (which almost certainly has a regular structure) is used as R(s) or its part, in order to have an ID of an owner and / or other data simply embedded into his public key; embedding such data in a public key is well known, in the art<br>
2.	System Personalization<br>
16<br><br>
Since there are many different ways to scatter the bits of R(s) (by choosing different generalized patterns G, for example) it is possible to create multiple PKI systems that use the same algorithmic base, but are not interoperable<br>
because of difference in parameters.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is a simplified flowchart<br>
illustration of a preferred method for producing a certificate in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of Fig. 2 is self-explanatory with reference to the above discussion.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which is a simplified flowchart illustration of a preferred method for producing a certificate in accordance with an --alternative preferred-embodiment of me-present-invention.--The-flowchart-of Fig. 3-is self-explanatory with reference to the above discussion.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 4, which is a simplified flowchart illustration of a preferred method for producing a plurality of certificates in accordance with a further alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention. It is noted that, in Fig. 4, reference is made to generating a single modulus N and a single associated certificate for each generalized pattern G; persons skilled in the art will appreciate that it is also possible to generate a plurality of moduli and a plurality of associated certificates for each generalized pattern G. The case of a plurality of moduli N and a plurality of associated certificates is believed to be preferred. The flowchart of Fig. 4 is self-explanatory with reference to the above discussion.<br>
It is appreciated that various features of the invention which are, for clarity, described in the contexts of separate embodiments may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.<br>
