TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present invention relates to a relay connector, a mounting structure of a relay connector and a chassis, a mounting structure of a relay connector and a discharge tube, a mounting structure of a relay connector and a power source, a mounting structure of a discharge tube and a power source on a relay connector, a lighting device, a display device and a television receiver.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002] An example of a lighting device capable of functioning as a backlight for a liquid crystal display device is disclosed in Patent Document 1.  The lighting device has a construction, in which a plurality of elongated discharge tubes are connected to one ends of relay terminals mounted to a substantially flat plate-like chassis while power sources are connected to the other ends of the relay terminals.  The power from the power sources is supplied to the discharge tubes via the relay terminals. Patent Document 1:  JP-A-2004-294592<br>
 <br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION [0003]  (Problem to be Solved by the Invention)<br>
In the above construction, bare relay terminals are directly mounted to the chassis. This precludes the use of a metallic chassis.<br>
The present invention was made in view of the foregoing circumstances, and an object thereof is to enable a relay connector, which is arranged to form a power supply path from a power source to a discharge tube, to be mounted to a metallic chassis. [0004]  (Means for Solving the Problem)<br>
As a means for achieving the above object, a relay connector according to the present invention, which is arranged to supply power from a power source arranged on the hack side of a chassis having substantially a plate-li]
[0006] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, the holder can be arranged to penetrate through a mounting hole of the chassis. An elastic retaining part capable of elastic deflection and an engaging surface capable of being arranged to be substantially perpendicular to the through direction of the mounting hole may be provided on an outer surface<br>
 <br>
of the holder, so that the holder can be fixed to the chassis while the chassis is sandwiched between the elastic retaining part and the engaging surface.<br>
[0007] In this case, the elastic retaining part deflects elastically, when the holder is inserted into the mounting hole. When the holder has reached the proper mounting position so that the engaging surface abuts on the opening edge of the mounting hole, the elastic retaining part is locked by the opening edge of mounting hole as a result of its elastic restoration. According to the present invention, the relay connector can be mounted to the chassis simply by inserting the holder into the mounting hole. [0008] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, a travel restricting portion, capable of abutting on an opening edge of the mounting hole when the holder is mounted to the chassis, may be provided on the outer surface of the holder on which the elastic retaining part is formed.<br>
[0009] The elastic retaining part can deform elastically so as to approach the outer surface of the holder. The elastic deformation of the elastic retaining part may cause movement of the holder relative to the chassis. However, according to the above construction, the movement of the holder relative to the chassis can be restricted due to the travel restricting portion abutting on the opening edge of the mounting hole. [0010] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, a surface of the elastic retaining part, which can abut on the opening edge of the mounting hole, may be formed of an inclined surface capable of being arranged at an angle to<br>
 <br>
the thickness direction of the chassis.<br>
[0011] In this case, the surface of the elastic retaining part,-which can abut on the opening edge of the mounting hole, is formed of an inclined surface that can be arranged at an angle to the thickness direction of the chassis. Thereby, the chassis can be infallibly sandwiched between the elastic retaining part and the engaging surface, even if the chassis has variation in thickness.<br>
[0012] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, a container room capable of holding an end portion of the discharge tube may be provided in the holder, so that a tube connecting portion of the relay terminal is arranged in the container room. The tube connecting portion can be electrically connected to the discharge tube within the container room.<br>
[0013] In this case, the connection between the discharge tube and the relay connector is housed within the container room, and therefore foreign substances can be prevented from interference with the connection.<br>
[0014] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, in a case where the mounting direction of the discharge tube to the container room is set to be perpendicular to the axis of the discharge tube, and a ferrule attached to the end portion of the discharge tube is held in the container room when the discharge tube is mounted; a movement restricting portion, capable of locking the ferrule so that axial movement of the discharge tube in a direction away from the container room is restricted, may be provided in the container room.<br>
[0015]  In this case, the movement of the discharge tube can be<br>
 <br>
restricted due to the movement restricting portion locking the ferrule, even if the discharge tube moves in the axial direction so as to escape from the container room.<br>
[0016] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, an extended portion, capable of being arranged to protrude from between the chassis and an opening edge of the container room and extend along the surface of the chassis, may be provided on an outer surface of the holder that is arranged perpendicularly to the surface of the chassis and includes an opening of the container room.<br>
[0017] In this case, the extended portion protruding from the outer surface of the holder is provided, which can result in a long creepage distance from the inside of the container room to the chassis. Thereby, a lea]
[0018] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, a tapered guiding portion, inclined from the mounting direction of the discharge tube, may be provided on the holder, so as to extend from an opening edge of an opening provided as a receiving opening of the container room for receiving the discharge tube.<br>
[0019] In this case, the tapered guiding portion can guide the discharge tube into the container room.<br>
[0020] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, in a case where the power source includes an on-board connector mounted on the hack  surface of a circuit board<br>
 <br>
that is to be arranged parallel to the chassis so that the back surface is on the opposite side of the chassis, and further includes an output terminal arranged in an engaging recess that is formed on the on-board connector so as to correspond to a fitting hole formed through the circuit board; a wall portion, capable of projecting to the back side of the chassis and penetrating through the fitting hole so as to be inserted into the engaging recess, may be provided on the holder. A board connecting portion capable of connection to the output terminal can be provided on the relay terminal so as to extend along the wall portion. [0021] In this case, the board connecting portion of the relay terminal can penetrate through the fitting hole of the circuit board so as to be connected to the output terminal within the engaging recess. Thus, the fitting hole formed as a through hole on the circuit board enables the on-board connector to be arranged on the back surface of the circuit board on the opposite side of the chassis. Further, the board connecting portion i.s arranged along the wall portion, and thereby the board connecting portion is prevented from deformation, or the like, caused by interference from a foreign substance.<br>
[0022] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, in a case where the output terminal includes a proximal portion arranged so that its displacement from the circuit board is restricted, a flexible portion extending from the proximal portion and being capable of elastic deflection, and a connecting part having substantially a U-shape that extends from the flexible portion and can elastically pinch the wall portion<br>
 <br>
and the board connecting portion; the board connecting portion when being inserted into the engaging recess can have elastic contact with a free-end-side strip portion of two strip portions of the connecting part on the opposite side of the flexible portion, while the wall portion can have elastic contact with a strip portion of the two strip portions of the connecting part on the side of the flexible portion.<br>
[0023] In this case, if the board connecting portion of the relay terminal displaces from the output terminal to the flexible portion side, the whole connecting part, together with the board connecting portion and the wall portion, moves to the flexible portion side while the connection between the board connecting portion and the free-end-side strip portion is maintained. If the board connecting portion displaces from the output terminal to the free end side or to the opposite side of the flexible portion, the free-end-side strip portion of the connecting part is pushed by the board connecting portion so as to move to the free end side. Then, the connection between the board connecting portion and the free-end-side strip portion is also maintained. [0024] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, in a case where the power source includes a plurality of output terminals which are arranged in a line on a circuit board so as to correspond to a plurality of relay terminals as the above relay terminal, and the output terminal includes a connecting part that is elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the array direction of the relay terminals and the output terminals; a board connecting portion, having a<br>
 <br>
plate-like shape wider than the connecting part and capable of being arranged parallel to the array direction of the relay terminals and the output terminals, may be provided on the relay terminal. The board connecting portion can have contact with the relay terminal.<br>
[0025] In the construction that includes a plurality of output terminals and a plurality of relay terminals arranged in lines, the output terminals may displace in the array direction from the relay terminals due to some reason such as the difference in thermal expansion rate between the circuit board as a mounting base for the output terminals and the chassis as a mounting base for the relay terminals.<br>
For this reason, according to the present invention, the connecting part is provided on the output terminal so as to be elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the array direction, while the board connecting portion is provided on the relay terminal so as to form a plate-like shape wider than the connecting part and arranged parallel to the array direction, so that the wide board connecting portion can have contact with the elongated connecting part. The board connecting portion is set to be large in width along the array direction, and therefore the connection between the board connecting portion and the connecting part can be maintained even if the relay terminals displace in the array direction from the output terminals.<br>
[0026] In the relay connector according to the present invention described above, a tube engaging portion arranged to allow the discharge tube to enter therein after approaching along a<br>
 <br>
direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis, and a power engaging portion arranged to allow an on-board connector of the power source to engage therewith after approaching along a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis may be provided on the holder. [0027] In this case, each of the mounting direction of the discharge tube to the relay connector and the mounting direction of the power source to the relay connector is set to be substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis. Therefore, the discharge tube and the power source can be mounted to the chassis so as to form a stack structure. [0028] As a means for achieving the above object, a mounting structure of a relay connector and a chassis, according to the present invention, is used to mount the relay connector to the chassis having substantially a plate-lilce shape. The relay connector is arranged to supply power from a power source arranged on the bac]
 <br>
while the chassis is sandwiched between the elastic retaining part and the engaging surface.<br>
[0029] According to the mounting structure, the elastic retaining part deflects elastically, when the holder is inserted into the mounting hole. When the holder has reached the proper mounting position so that the engaging surface abuts on the opening edge of the mounting hole, the elastic retaining part is locked by the opening edge of mounting hole as a result of its elastic restoration. According to the present invention, the relay connector can be mounted to the chassis simply by inserting the holder into the mounting hole.<br>
[0030] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a chassis according to the present invention described above, a travel restricting portion capable of abutting on an opening edge of the mounting hole may be provided on the outer surface of the holder on which the elastic retaining part is formed. [0031] The elastic retaining part can deform elastically so as to approach the outer surface of the holder. The elastic deformation of the elastic retaining part may cause movement of the holder relative to the chassis. However, according to the above construction, the movement of the holder relative to the chassis can be restricted due to the travel restricting portion abutting on the opening edge of the mounting hole. [0032] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a chassis according to the present invention described above, a surface of the elastic retaining part, which abuts on the opening edge of the mounting hole, may be formed of an inclined surface<br>
 <br>
tilted at an angle to the thickness direction of the chassis. [0033] In this case, the surface of the elastic retaining part, which abuts on the opening edge of the mounting hole, is formed of an inclined surface tilted at an angle to the thickness direction of the chassis. Thereby, the chassis can be infallibly sandwiched between the elastic retaining part and the engaging surface, even if the chassis has variation in thickness.<br>
[0034] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a chassis according to the present invention described above, in a case where a container room capable of holding an end portion of the discharge tube is provided in the holder so that the relay terminal can be electrically connected to the discharge tube within the container room; an extended portion, arranged to protrude from between the chassis and an opening edge of the container room and extend along the surface of the chassis, may be provided on an outer surface of the holder that is arranged perpendicularly to the surface of the chassis and includes an opening of the container room.<br>
[0035] In this case, the extended portion protruding from the outer surface of the holder is provided, which can result in a long creepage distance from the inside of the container room to the chassis. Thereby, a leak, from the discharge tube held in the container room to the chassis outside the holder, can be prevented.<br>
[0036] As a means for achieving the above object, a mounting structure of a relay connector and a discharge tube, according to the present invention, is provided.  The relay connector is<br>
 <br>
arranged to supply power from a power source arranged on the back side of a chassis having substantially a plate-like shape to a discharge tube arranged on the front side of the chassis. In the mounting structure, the relay connector includes a holder having an insulation property and to be mounted to the chassis, and further includes a relay terminal mounted"to the holder and capable of electrical connection to the discharge tube and the power source. A container room capable of holding an end portion of the discharge tube is provided in the holder, and a tube connecting portion of the relay terminal is arranged in the container room so that the discharge tube is electrically connected to the tube connecting portion within the container room.<br>
[0037] In this case, the connection between the discharge tube and the relay connector is housed within the container room, and therefore foreign substances can be prevented from interference with the connection.<br>
[0038] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a discharge tube according to the present invention described above, in a case where the mounting direction of the discharge tube to the container room is set to be perpendicular to the axis of the discharge tube, and a ferrule attached to the end portion of the discharge tube is held in the container room when the discharge tube is mounted; a movement restricting portion, capable of locking the ferrule so that axial movement of the discharge tube in a direction away from the container room is restricted, may be provided in the container room. [0039] In this case, the movement of the discharge tube can be<br>
 <br>
restricted due to the movement restricting portion locking the ferrule, even if the discharge tube moves in the axial direction so as to escape from the container room,<br>
[0040] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a discharge tube according to the present invention described above, an extended portion, capable of being arranged to protrude from between the chassis and an opening edge of the container room and extend along the surface of the chassis, may be provided on an outer surface of the holder that is arranged perpendicularly to the surface of the chassis and includes an opening of the container room.<br>
[0041] In this case, the extended portion protruding from the outer surface of the holder is provided, which can result in a long creepage distance from the inside of the container room to the chassis. Thereby, a lea]
[0042] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a discharge tube according to the present invention described above, a tapered guiding portion, inclined from the mounting direction of the discharge tube, may be provided on the holder, so as to extend from an opening edge of an opening provided as a receiving opening of the container room for receiving the discharge tube.<br>
[0043] In this case, the tapered guiding portion can guide the discharge tube into the container room.<br>
[0044] As a means for achieving the above object, a mounting structure of a relay connector and a power source, according to<br>
 <br>
the present invention, is provided. The relay connector is arranged to supply power from a power source arranged on the back side of a chassis having substantially a plate-like shape to a discharge tube arranged on the front side of the chassis. In the mounting structure, the power source includes an on-board connector mounted on the back surface of a circuit board that is to be arranged parallel to the chassis so that the back surface is on an opposite side of the chassis, and further includes an output terminal arranged in an engaging recess that is formed on the on-board connector so as to correspond to a fitting hole formed through the circuit board. The relay connector includes a holder having an insulation property and to be mounted to the chassis, and further includes a relay terminal mounted to the holder and capable of electrical connection to the discharge tube and the power source. A wall portion, capable of projecting to the back side of the chassis and penetrating through the fitting hole so as to be inserted into the engaging recess, is provided on the holder. A board connecting portion capable of connection to the output terminal is provided on the relay terminal, so as to extend along the wall portion.<br>
[0045] The board connecting portion of the relay terminal can penetrate through the fitting hole of the circuit board so as to be connected to the output terminal within the engaging recess. Thus, the fitting hole formed as a through hole on the circuit board enables the on-board connector to be arranged on the back surface of the circuit board on the opposite side of the chassis. Further, the board connecting portion is arranged along the wall<br>
 <br>
portion, and thereby the board connecting portion is prevented from deformation, or the like, caused by interference from a foreign substance.<br>
[0046] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a power source according to the present invention described above, the output terminal can include a proximal portion arranged so that its displacement from the circuit board is restricted, a flexible portion extending from the proximal portion and being capable of elastic deflection, and a connecting part having substantially a U-shape that extends from the flexible portion and can elastically pinch the wall portion and the board connecting portion. The board connecting portion when being inserted into the engaging recess can have elastic contact with a free-end-side strip portion of two strip portions of the connecting part on the opposite side of the flexible portion, while the wall portion can have elastic contact with a strip portion of the two strip portions of the connecting part on the side of the flexible portion, [0047] In this case, if the board connecting portion of the relay terminal displaces from the output terminal to the flexible portion side, the whole connecting part, together with the board connecting portion and the wall portion, moves to the flexible portion side while the connection between the board connecting portion and the free-end-side strip portion is maintained. If the board connecting portion displaces from the output terminal to the free end side or to the opposite side of the flexible portion, the free-end-side strip portion of the connecting part is pushed by the board connecting portion so as to move to the free end side.<br>
 <br>
Then, the connection between the board connecting portion and the free-end-side strip portion is also maintained. [0048] In the mounting structure of a relay connector and a power source according to the present invention described above, the power source can include a plurality of output terminals as the above output terminal, which are arranged in a line on the circuit board so as to correspond to a plurality of relay terminals as the above relay terminal. The output terminal may include a connecting part that is elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the array direction of the relay terminals and the output terminals, while the board connecting portion may have a plate-like shape wider than the connecting part and arranged parallel to the array direction of the relay terminals and the output terminals. The board connecting portion can have contact with the relay terminal.<br>
[0049] In the construction that includes a plurality of output terminals and a plurality of relay terminals arranged in lines,. the output terminals may displace in the array direction from the relay terminals due to some reason such as the difference in thermal expansion rate between the circuit board as a mounting base for the output terminals and the chassis as a mounting base for the relay terminals.<br>
For this reason, in the above construction, the connecting part is provided on the output terminal so as to be elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the array direction, while the board connecting portion is provided on the relay terminal so as to form a plate-lilce shape wider than the connecting<br>
 <br>
part and arranged parallel to the array direction, so that the wide board connecting portion can have contact with the elongated connecting part. The board connecting portion is set to be large in width along the array direction, and therefore the connection between the board connecting portion and the connecting part can be maintained even if the relay terminals displace in the array direction from the output terminals.<br>
[0050] As a means for achieving the above object, a mounting structure of a discharge tube and a power source on a relay connector, according to the present invention, is used to mount the discharge tube and the power source to the relay connector that is arranged to supply power from the power source arranged on the back side of a chassis having substantially a plate-like shape to the discharge tube arranged on the front side of the chassis. In the mounting structure, the relay connector includes a holder having an insulation property and to be mounted to the chassis, and further includes a relay terminal mounted to the holder and capable of electrical connection to the discharge tube and the power source. A tube engaging portion arranged to allow the discharge tube to enter therein after approaching along a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis, and a power engaging portion arranged to allow the power source to engage therewith after approaching along a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis are provided on the holder.<br>
[0051] In this case, each of the mounting direction of the discharge tube to the relay connector and the mounting direction<br>
 <br>
on<br>
on<br>
of the power source to the relay connector is set to be substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis. Therefore, the discharge tube and the power source can be mounted to the chassis so as to form a stack structure. [0052] A lighting device according to the present inventi includes a relay connector according to the present inventi described above, a discharge tube, a power source and a chassis. [0053] In the lighting device described above, a plurality of relay connectors as the above relay connector can be arranged in a line along one lateral edge of a pair of parallel lateral edges of the chassis. A grounding member, which includes a plurality of grounding terminals conductively mounted to an elongated metallic support plate and arranged in a line, may be arranged along the other lateral edge of the pair of parallel lateral edges of the chassis. A plurality of discharge tubes as the above discharge tube, which are elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the pair of lateral edges, can be arranged parallel to one another, so that a ferrule attached to one end portion of each of the plurality of discharge tubes is individually connected to the relay terminal of the relay connector while a ferrule attached to the other end portion of each of the plurality of discharge tubes is individually connected to the grounding terminal.<br>
[0054] In this case, the plurality of discharge tubes are short-circuited through the grounding member connected to the ferrule attached on the end of each discharge tube, and are collectively grounded,  in which the plurality of grounding<br>
 <br>
terminals of the grounding member are not required to be insulated from one another. Therefore, insulating members, which surround the grounding terminals for insulation purposes or separate the grounding terminals, are not necessary. Thus, the number of components can be reduced according the present invention.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0059]  <embodiment><br>
An embodiment 1 according to the present invention will be hereinafter explained with reference to FIGS. 1 to 17. [0060]  [Overview of Display Device D]<br>
A display device D used in a television receiver TV shown in FIG. 1 is a so-called liquid crystal display device, which generally forms a horizontally-elongated rectangular shape and includes a display panel 11 and a lighting device 10 as shown in FIG. 2. The display panel 11 is disposed on the front side of the lighting device 10, so that the lighting device 10 as a backlight can illuminate the display panel 11 from the back side. As shown in FIG. 1, the television receiver TV includes the display device D, and front and back cabinets Ca and Cb capable of holding the display device D therebetween. Further included are a power source P other than a power board 16 (corresponding to a power<br>
 <br>
source of the present invention) described below, a tuner T and a stand S. FIG. 2 schematically shows the display device D, and therefore the shapes of relay connectors 14, on-board connectors 18 and the like differ slightly from those in the other figures.<br>
The display panel 11 has a well-known construction, in which liquid crystal as a material with an optical property that changes with applied voltage is disposed in the gap between a transparent TFT substrate and a transparent CF substrate. TFTs (Thin Film Transistors), as switching elements connected to a source wiring line and a gate wiring line running at right angles to each other, and pixel electrodes connected to the TFTs are provided on the TFT substrate. A color filter, on which color sections of three primary colors, i.e.. Red (R) , Green (G) and Blue (B) , are arranged in a matrix, and a common electrode are provided on the CF substrate. [0061]  [Overview of Lighting Device 10]<br>
As shovm in FIGS. 2 to 4, the lighting device 10 includes a lamp unit 12 and power boards 16 (corresponding to a power source of the present invention) . The lamp unit 12 includes a metallic chassis 13, which generally forms a horizontally-elongated rectangular plate and functions as a reflector plate. Further included are a plurality of discharge tubes 15 held in a horizontal position and vertically arranged on the front side of the chassis 13 so as to be parallel to one another, and a plurality of relay connectors 14 which are vertically arranged along the lateral edges of the chassis 13 so as to correspond to the discharge tubes 15.  The power boards 16 are disposed on the back side of the<br>
 <br>
chassis 13 so as to supply power to the discharge tubes 15 via the relay connectors 14.<br>
[0062] A plurality of substantially rectangular mounting holes 13H corresponding to the ends of the discharge tubes 15 are formed through the chassis 13 so'as to extend from the front side to the back side, and are vertically arranged to be level with the respective discharge tubes 15. The relay connectors 14 are mounted through the respective mounting holes 13H. [0063]  [Relay Connector 14]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5 to 8 and 10, each relay connector 14 includes a holder 20 made of synthetic resin, and a metallic relay terminal 30 housed in the holder 20.<br>
The holder 20 includes a box-like portion 21 that forms a block-like shape as a whole, and further includes a wall portion 27 that projects backward from the back surface of the box-like portion 21. On the holder 20, a pair of upper and lower elastic retaining parts 25 are formed as cantilevered portions, which extend posteriorly (i.e., in the same direction as the mounting direction of relay connector 14 to the chassis 13) and along the outer surface (i.e., upper surface and lower surface) of the box-like portion 21. A retaining protrusion 25a having a substantially right triangular shape is provided on the distal end of each elastic retaining part 25 so as to project to the opposite side of the box-like portion 21. Further, travel restricting portions 24 having an elongated rib-like shape are formed on the respective upper and lower surfaces of the box-like portion 21 so as to extend along the elastic retaining parts 25<br>
 <br>
(or parallel to the elastic retaining parts 25) . The longitudinal area (i.e., the area extending parallel to the mounting direction of the relay connector 14 to the chassis 13), that includes the travel restricting portion 24, substantially corresponds to the longitudinal area that includes the elastic retaining part 25. An abutting surface (or an insertion restricting portion) 20a for abutting on the circuit board 17 is formed on the distal end side (i.e., the anterior end side along the mounting direction of the relay connector 14 to the circuit board 17) of each travel restricting portion 24. Due to the abutting surfaces 20a, the distal end of the relay terminal 30 or the distal end of the wall portion 27 is prevented from contact with the far end of an engaging recess 30. A pair of engaging surfaces 26 are formed on the back surface of the box-like portion 21, and are positioned on the right side of the wall portion 27 and the left side of the wall portion 27, respectively. The pair of engaging surfaces 26 are arranged across the elastic retaining parts 25, i.e., on the respective right and left sides thereof, so as to be parallel to the chassis 13.<br>
[0064] A container room 23 (corresponding to a tube engaging portion of the present invention) is formed in the box-like portion 21, so as to have an opening extending from the front side to the right side (i.e., to the lateral side on the opposite side of the lateral edge portion of the chassis 13) . The front opening portion of the opening of the container room 23 is provided as a receiving opening 23a, into which an end portion (or ferrule 50) of the discharge tube 15 is fitted from the front side.  The lateral<br>
 <br>
opening portion is provided as an escape opening 23b for preventing interference with the glass tube 40 when the end portion of the discharge tube 15 is held in the container room 23. A movement restricting portion 22 is formed on the escape opening 23a, so as to bulge inward from the opening edge. The vertical size of the gap corresponding to the movement restricting portion 22 is set to be smaller than the inner diameter of the body 51 of the ferrule 50. On the box-like portion 21, an extended portion 28 protruding parallel to the chassis 13 is formed on the lateral surface of the box-like portion 21 that includes the escape opening 23b. The extended portion extends so as to separate the front surface of the chassis 13 from the escape opening 23b. The surface of the extended portion 28 that faces the chassis 13 is provided as the engaging surface 26 described above. A lightening portion is formed on the extended portion 28 by cutting or removing the chassis 13 facing surface (or back surface) thereof. [0065] The relay terminal 30 is held within the holder 20. The relay terminal 30, which can be formed by bending a metallic plate that is formed into a predetermined shape by punching, includes a tube connecting portion 31 having a pair of upper and lower elastic nipping parts 32 formed of plates having a substantially circular arc shape, and further includes a board connecting portion 33 having a plate-like shape projecting to the back side. A pair of supporting parts 34 are formed on the end portion of the board connecting portion 33, so as to extend orthogonally from its upper and lower edge portions. The pair of elastic nipping parts 32 extend from the pair of supporting parts 34 to the front<br>
 <br>
side. The elastic nipping parts 32 are disposed in the container room 23. On the other hand, the board connecting portion 33 projects from the back surface of the box-like portion 21 so as to be exposed to the outside of the holder 20, and extends backwards along the wall portion 27. A pair of rib-like holding portions 27a are formed on the wall portion 27 so as to extend along its upper and lower edges. The board connecting portion 33 is fixed to the wall portion 27 with its upper and lower edge portions fitted into the grooves of the rib-like holding portions 27a. The projecting direction of the wall portion 27 or the board connecting portion 33 extending from the box-like portion 21 is set to be perpendicular to the chassis 13 (i.e., it is the same direction as the mounting direction of relay connector 14 to the chassis 13) .<br>
[0066] When the relay connector 14 is mounted to the chassis 13, referring to FIG. 9, the wall portion 27 of the holder 20 is inserted into the mounting hole 13H of the chassis 13 from the front side,-so that the engaging surfaces 26 abut on the opening edge of the mounting hole 13H on the front surface of the chassis 13. In the course of the insertion, the retaining protrusions 25a of the elastic retaining parts 25 become in contact with the opening edge of the mounting hole 13H, and thereby the elastic retaining parts 25 deform elastically so as to approach the box-like portion 21. When the engaging surfaces 26 become in contact with the front surface of the chassis 13, the retaining protrusions 25a having passed through the mounting hole 13H cause elastic restoration of the elastic retaining parts 25. As a result of the elastic<br>
 <br>
restoration, the retaining protrusions 25a are locked by the opening edge of the mounting hole 13H on the back surface of the chassis 13. Consequently, the chassis 13 is sandwiched between the engaging surfaces 26 on the front side and the retaining protrusions 25a on the back side. Thus, the holder 20 is fixed to the chassis 13 so that its movement in the mounting direction<br>
(i.e., the through direction of the mounting hole 13H) is restricted. Then, the mounting of the relay connector 14 to the chassis 13 is completed.<br>
[0067] When the relay connector 14 is attached to the chassis 13, the box-like portion 21 as the front end portion of the holder 20 projects (or is exposed) to the front side of the chassis 13 while the wall portion 27 as the back end portion of the holder 20 projects (or is exposed) to the back side of the chassis 13. The elastic retaining parts 25 can deform elastically so as to approach the outer surface of the holder 20 (or so as to cause vertical movement) . Due to the elastic deformation of the elastic retaining parts 25, the holder 2 0 may move in the vertical direction relative to the chassis 13 (or relative to the mounting hole 13H) . However, in the present embodiment, the vertical movement of the holder 20 relative to the chassis 13 can be restricted due to the travel restricting portions 24, which are formed on the same outer surface as the elastic retaining parts 25 so as to abut on the opening edge of the mounting hole 13H.<br>
[0068]  [Discharge Tube 15]<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, each discharge tube 15 is formed of a cold cathode fluorescent tube that includes a generally<br>
 <br>
elongated glass tube 40 having a circular cross section, elongated outer leads 42 which have a circular cross section and project linearly from the respective ends of the glass tube 40 and coaxially with the glass tube 40, and further includes ferrules 50 attached to the respective end portions of the glass tube 40. Each ferrule 50 is a single-piece component, which can be formed by bending or hammering a metallic (e.g., copper alloy) plate that is gilded and formed into a predetermined shape by punching. The ferrule 50 includes a body 51 that generally forms a cylindrical shape, and further includes a conductive part 57 that extends from the body 51 in an oblique direction leaning inwardly. The body 51 is fitted onto the outer circumference of the end portion of the glass tube 40, while the conductive part 57 is connected to the outer lead 42.<br>
[0069] The discharge tube 15 is fixed to relay connectors 14. At the time of fixation, the discharge tube 15 held in a horizontal position is moved toward the front face of the chassis 13; and the end portions and the ferrules 50 of the glass tube 40 are fitted into the container rooms 23 of the relay connectors 14 from the front side. The mounting direction of the discharge tube 15 to the relay connectors 14 is set to be substantially perpendicular to the front face of the chassis 13. When the discharge tube 15 enters the container rooms 23, the pairs of elastic nipping parts 32 are pushed to open vertica.lly due to elastic deflection, resulting in elastically pinching the bodies 51 of the ferrules 50. Consequently, the discharge tube 15 is held by the tube connecting portions 31 at its end portions, and is thus fixed to<br>
 <br>
the chassis 13 via the relay terminals 30 and the holders 20 provided as the relay terminal 30 mounting bases. [0070] When the discharge tube 15 is attached to the relay connectors 14, the weight of the discharge tube 15 is received solely by the chassis 13 via the relay connectors 14. That is, the outer leads 42 will not be under load due to the weight of the discharge tube 15. Further, the pair of elastic nipping parts 32 can have contact with the body 51 while elastically pinching it. Thereby, the outer lead 42 is electrically conductively connected to the relay terminal 30 via the ferrule 50. The ferrule 50 fitted onto the end portion of the discharge tube 15 is held in the container room 23, and the movement restricting portion 22 narrower than the inner diameter of the ferrule 50 is provided on the escape opening 23b of the container room 23. Therefore, even if the end portion of the discharge tube 15, together with the ferrule 50, moves in the axial direction so as to escape from the container room 23, the movement of the discharge tube 15 can be restricted due to the movement restricting portion 22 catching the ferrule 50. Further, the extended portion 28 is formed on the outer surface of the holder 20, that is perpendicular to the surface of the chassis 13 and includes the escape opening 23b of the container room 123, so as to protrude from between the chassis 13 and the escape opening 23b and extend along the surface of the chassis 13. This results in a long creepage distance from the inside of the container room 23 to the front surface of the chassis 13. Thereby, a leak, from the discharge tube 15 held in the container room 23 to the chassis 13 outside the holder 20, can<br>
 <br>
be prevented. [0071]  [Overview of Power Board 16]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, each power board 16 includes a circuit board 17 having a circuit formed on its back surface (i.e., the surface on the opposite side of the chassis 13), electronic components 19 mounted on the back surface of the circuit board 17, and a plurality of on-board connectors 18 mounted on the back surface of the circuit board 17.<br>
The circuit board 17 has a vertically-elongated rectangular shape as a whole, and is formed using a phenolic paper-base copper-clad laminated board (known as a phenolic paper). A plurality of fitting holes 17H having a vertically-elongated rectangular shape are formed through the circuit board 17 so as to extend from the front side to the back side. The plurality of fitting holes 17H are arranged vertically along the lateral side edge of the circuit board 17 so as to correspond to the above-described relay terminals 30 (or relay connectors 14) . [0072] As shown in FIGS. 14 to 17, each on-board connector 18 includes a housing 60 made of synthetic resin, and a metallic output terminal 70 completely contained in the housing 60. The on-board connectors 18 are arranged along the lateral side edge of the circuit board 17 so as to correspond to the respective fitting holes 17H. An engaging recess 63 with a vertically-elongated rectangular opening is formed on the outer surface (i.e., the circuit board 17 facing surface) of the housing 60. The position and size of the engaging recess 63 are set to correspond substantially to those of the fitting hole 17H.  The relay<br>
 <br>
connector 14 is fitted into the engaging recess 63. [0073] The output terminal 70, which can be formed by bending a metallic plate that is formed into a predetermined shape by punching, includes a proximal portion 71, a supported portion 74, a flexible portion 72 and a connecting part 73. The output terminal 70 is mounted into the housing 60 from the circuit board 17 facing surface side. The proximal portion 71 has a plate-like shape, and is fixed to the housing 60 by press fitting while being electrically connected to the circuit board 17. The proximal portion 71 is thus fixed to the circuit board 17, and consequently the on-board connector 18 is integrated with the circuit board 17. The supported portion 74 generally forms an elongated shape, and extends substantially orthogonally from the proximal portion 71. The flexible portion 72 generally forms an elongated shape, and extends substantially orthogonally from the distal end of the supported portion 74. The flexible portion 72 can be slanted at an acute or obtuse angle to the supported portion 74, due to its elastic deformation. The connecting part 73 generally forms an elongated shape, and specifically forms substantially a U-shape having a narrowed open end. The connecting part 73 includes a first strip portion 73a that loops back at the distal end of the flexible portion 72 and extends in a direction away from the circuit board 17, and further includes a second strip portion 73b that loops back at the distal end of the first strip portion 73a and extends in a direction toward the circuit board 17. On the connecting part 73, the distance between the strip portions 73a, 73b is partly set to be shorter.  The shorter-distance portions<br>
 <br>
of the strip portions 73a, 73b are located in the engaging recess 63.<br>
[0074] The power board 16 is mounted to the chassis 13 by being moved toward the chassis 13 from the back side while the circuit board 17 is kept parallel to the chassis 13. The mounting direction of the on-board connectors 18 to the relay connectors 14 is directly opposite to the mounting direction of the discharge tube 15 to the relay connectors 14 . That is, the fitting direction of the on-board connectors 18 is parallel to the mounting direction of the discharge tube 15 to the relay connectors 14. At the time of fixation, the wall portion 27 of each relay connector 14 and the board connecting portion 33 arranged along the wall portion 27 penetrate the circuit board 17 through the fitting hole 17H, and are inserted into the engaging recess 63 of the on-board connector 18 so as to be placed between the first strip portion 73a and the second strip portion 73b, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 16. Consequently, the wall portion 27 has contact with the first strip portion 73a, while the board connecting portion 33 has contact with the second strip portion 73b. The connecting part 73 deforms elastically so as to increase the distance between the first strip portion 73a and the second strip portion 73b. The relay connector 14 is thus fitted into the on-board connector 18, and thereby the relay terminal 30 is conductively connected to the output terminal 70. Consequently, the power board 1 6 is connected to the discharge tubes 15 via the relay connectors 14, so that the power from the power board 16 can be supplied to the discharge tubes 15. When the on-board connectors IB have reached a proper state of being<br>
 <br>
fitted onto the relay connectors 14, the power board 16 is screwed to the chassis 13.<br>
[0075] When the power board 16 is attached to the relay connector 14, the board connecting portion 33 in the engaging recess 63 has elastic contact with the free-end-side strip portion 73a of the two strip portions 73a, 73b of the connecting part 73 on the opposite side of the flexible portion 72, while the wall portion 27 has elastic contact with the strip portion 73a of the two strip portions 73a, 73b of the connecting part 73 on the side of the flexible portion 72. According to the construction, if the board connecting portion 33 of the relay terminal 30 displaces from the output terminal 70 to the flexible portion 72 side, the whole connecting part 73, together with the board connecting portion 33 and the wall portion 27, moves to the flexible portion 72 side while the connection between the board connecting portion 33 and the free-end-side strip portion 73b is maintained. On the other hand, if the board connecting portion 33 displaces from the output terminal 70 to the free end side or to the opposite side of the flexible portion 72, the free-end-side strip portion 73b of the connecting part 73 is pushed by the board connecting portion 33 so as to move to the free end side. Then, the connection between the board connecting portion 33 and the free-end-side strip portion 73b is also maintained.<br>
[0076] In the construction that includes a plurality of output terminals 70 and a plurality of relay terminals 30 arranged in lines, the output terminals 70 may displace in the array direction from the relay terminals 30 due to some reason such as the<br>
 <br>
difference in thermal expansion rate between the circuit board 17 as a mounting base for the output terminals 70 and the chassis 13 as a mounting base for the relay terminals 30.<br>
For this reason, in the present embodiment, the connecting part 73 is provided on the output terminal 70 so as to be elongated in a direction substantially perpendicular to the array direction, while the board connecting portion 33 is provided on the relay terminal 30 so as to form a plate-like shape wider than the connecting part 73 and parallel to the array direction, so that the wide board connecting portion 33 has contact with the elongated connecting part 73. The board connecting portion 33 is set to be large in width along the array direction, and therefore the connection between the board connecting portion 33 and the connecting part 73 can be maintained even if the relay terminal 30 displaces in the array direction from the output terminal 70.<br>
The fitting holes 17H are formed as through holes on the circuit board 17. This enables the on-board connectors 18 to be arranged on the back surface of the circuit board 17 on the opposite side of the chassis 13.<br>
The relay terminal 30 is fitted into the engaging recess 63 so that the clearance space is left between the relay terminal 30 and the inside surface of the engaging recess 63. Due to the clearance space, the relay terminal 30 is movable within the engaging recess 63. For example, the relay terminal 30 is fitted into the engaging recess 63 so as to be movable in the vertical direction in FIG. 5, i.e., in the inserting direction. Even when the relay terminal 30 moves or displaces in the inserting direction.<br>
 <br>
the connection to the output terminal 70 can be maintained. Specifically, the margin for contact, which extends toward the far end of the engaging recess 63 from the contact portion formed between the board connecting portion 33 and the connecting part 73, is set to be larger than the allowed movement distance along the inserting direction, as shown in FIG. 5. Thereby, the connection between the relay terminal 30 and the output terminal 70 can be maintained. The length of the wall portion 27 is designed so that the distal end of the relay terminal 30 is prevented from contact with the far end of the engaging recess 63 when the relay terminal 30 is inserted into the engaging recess 63. [0077] The relay connector 14 of the present embodiment is formed to include a holder 20 having an insulation property and to be mounted to the chassis 13, and further include a relay terminal 30 mounted to the holder 20 and capable of electrical connection to the discharge tube 15 and the power board 16, as described above. That is, the relay terminal 30 is immune to direct contact with the chassis 13. This enables the use of a metallic chassis 13. [0078] The holder 20 is formed to be capable of penetrating through the mounting hole 13H of the chassis 13. Further, the elastic retaining parts 25 capable of elastic deflection and extending substantially parallel to the through direction of the mounting hole 13H, and the engaging surfaces 26 substantially perpendicular to the through direction of the mounting hole 13H are provided on the outer surface of the holder 20. The holder 20 is fixed to the chassis 13 while the chassis 13 is sandwiched between the elastic retaining parts 25 and the engaging surfaces<br>
 <br>
26. According to the construction, the relay connector 14 can be mounted to the chassis 13 simply by inserting the holder 20 into the mounting hole 13H.<br>
[0079] The discharge tube 15 is electrically connected to the tube connecting portion 31 within the container room 23. Thereby, foreign substances are prevented from interference with the connection between the discharge tube 15 and the relay terminal 30.<br>
Further, the board connecting portion 33 is arranged along the wall portion 27, and thereby the board connecting portion 33 is prevented from deformation, or the like, caused by interference from a foreign substance.<br>
On the holder 20, the container room 23 (or the tube engaging portion) that allows the discharge tube 15 to enter therein after approaching along a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis 13 is provided, and further the wall portion 27 (or a power engaging port ion) that allov/s the on-board connector 18 of the power board 16 to engage therewith after approaching along a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis 13 is provided. Thus, each of the mounting direction of the discharge tube 15 to the relay connectors 14 and the mounting direction of the power boards 16 to the relay connectors 14 is set to be substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis 13. Therefore, the discharge tubes 15 and the power boards 16 can be mounted to the chassis 13 so as to form a stack structure. [0080]  <embodiment><br>
Next, an embodiment 2 of the present invention will be<br>
 <br>
explained with reference to FIG. 18. In the present embodiment 2, the construction of the retaining protrusion 25a of an elastic retaining part 25 differs from that of the above embodiment 1. The other constructions are similar to the above embodiment 1. Therefore, the same constructions are designated by the same symbols, and explanations for the constructions, operations and effects thereof are omitted.<br>
In the present embodiment 2, the surface of the retaining protrusion 25a of each elastic retaining part 25, which abuts on the opening edge of the mounting hole 13H, is formed of an inclined surface 25b that is tilted at an angle to the thickness direction of the chassis 13 (i.e., to the mounting direction of the relay connector 14 to the chassis 13). According to the construction, the chassis 13 can be infallibly sandwiched between the elastic retaining parts 25 and the engaging surfaces 26, even if the chassis 13 has variation in thickness. [0081]  <embodiment><br>
Next, an embodiment 3 of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 19 and 20. In the present embodiment 3, tapered guiding portions 29 are provided on the holder 20 of each relay connector 14 of the embodiment 1. A pair of upper and lower tapered guiding portions 29 are formed so as to protrude anteriorly from the opening edge of the receiving opening 23a that is provided as an opening of the container room 23 for receiving a discharge tube 15 . Each tapered guiding portion 29 includes guiding surfaces inclined from the mounting direction of the discharge tube 15.  The guiding surfaces are arranged across<br>
 <br>
the tube connecting portion 31, i.e., on the respective right and left sides thereof.<br>
The tapered guiding portions 29 thus formed can guide a discharge tube 15 into the container room 23 at the time of its fixation. In the case that a discharge tube 15 is mounted, to relay connectors 14 while being held by an arm (not shown) of an automatic machine, the discharge tube 15 can be correctly positioned with respect to the tube connecting portion 31 provided in the container room 23, if guided surfaces inclined at the same angle as the guiding surfaces of the tapered guiding portions are formed on the arm side. [0082]  <embodiment><br>
Next, an embodiment 4 of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 21 to 32. In the present embodiment 4, the construction of a lighting device 110 differs from that of the above embodiment 1. The other constructions are similar to the above embodiment 1. Therefore, the same constructions are designated by the same symbols, and explanations for the constructions, operations and effects thereof are omitted. [0083]  [Overview of Lighting Device 110]<br>
The lighting device 110 includes a lamp unit 112 and power boards 116, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 22 . The lamp unit 112 includes a metallic chassis 113, which generally forms a horizontally-elongated rectangular plate and functions as a reflector plate. Further included are a plurality of discharge tubes 115 held in a horizontal position and vertically arranged on the front side of the chassis 113 so as to be parallel to one<br>
 <br>
another, and a plurality of relay connectors 114 which are vertically arranged along the lateral edges of the chassis 113 so as to correspond to the discharge tubes 115. The power boards 116 are disposed on the back side of the chassis 113 so as to supply power to the discharge tubes 115 via the relay connectors 114.<br>
A plurality of substantially rectangular mounting holes 113H corresponding to the ends of the discharge tubes 115 are formed through the chassis 113 so as to extend from the front side to the back side, and are vertically arranged to be level with the respective discharge tubes 115. The relay connectors 114 are mounted through the respective mounting holes 113H. [0084]  [Relay Connector 114]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 23 to 26, each relay connector 114 includes a holder 120 made of synthetic resin, and a relay terminal 131 that is housed in the holder 120 and made of metal (e.g., stainless steel).<br>
The holder 120 includes a box-like portion 121 that forms a block-like shape as a whole, and further includes a wall portion 122 that projects backward from the back surface of the box-like portion 121.<br>
A container room 123 is formed in the box-like portion 121, so as to have an opening extending from the front side to the lateral side (i.e., the lateral side on the opposite side of the lateral edge portion of the chassis 113). The front opening portion of the opening of the container room 123 is provided as a receiving opening 124, into which an end portion (or ferrule 136) of the discharge tube 115 is fitted from the front side.  The lateral<br>
 <br>
opening portion is provided as an escape opening 125 for preventing interference with the glass tube 134 when the end portion of the discharge tube 115 is held in the container room 123. A stopper 126 (corresponding to a movement restricting portion of the present invention) is formed on the escape opening 125, so as to bulge inward from the opening edge and form a plate-like shape. Due to the stopper 126, the escape opening 125 is narrowed so as to form a substantially U-shaped opening. The vertical size of the substantially U-shaped escape opening 125 is set to be smaller than the inner diameter of the body 137 of the ferrule 136 and be equal to or slightly larger than the outer diameter of the glass tube 134 of the discharge tube 115. On the escape opening 125, a concave portion 127 having a semicircular shape is formed on the far end portion of the opening edge. The radius of curvature of the concave portion 127 is set to be equal to or slightly larger than the radius of curvature of the outer circumference of the glass tube 134. On the escape opening 125, a pair of upper and lower guiding portions 128 are formed on areas of the opening edge on the front side of the concave portion 127.<br>
On the box-like portion 121, an extended portion 129 extending parallel to the chassis 113 is formed on the lateral surface of the box-like portion 121 that includes the escape opening 125. The extended portion 129 extends so as to separate the front surface of the chassis 113 from the escape opening 125. A pair of upper and lower retaining protrusions 130 are formed on the outer surface (i.e., upper surface and lower surface) of the box-like portion 121.<br>
 <br>
[0085] The relay terminal 131 is held within the holder 120. The relay terminal 131 can be formed by bending a metallic plate that is formed into a predetermined shape by punching. The relay terminal 131 includes a pair of vertically symmetrical elastic pressing parts 132 formed of curved plates, and further includes a board connecting portion 133 formed as a flat plate-like portion that projects to the back side. The pair of elastic pressing parts 132, which are housed in the container room 123, can deflect elastically and vertically so as to increase distance therebetween. The vertical distance between the pair of elastic pressing parts 132 is shortest at a position corresponding to the front side of the concave portion 127 of the stopper 126. The minimum distance between the elastic pressing parts 132, when the elastic pressing parts 132 are not forced into elastic deflection or are in a free state, is set to be smaller than the outer diameter of the body 137 of the ferrule 136 attached on the discharge tube 115. On the other hand, the board connecting portion 133 projects from the back surface of the box-like portion 121 so as to be exposed to the outside of the holder 120, and extends backwards along the wall portion 122.<br>
[0086] When the relay connector 114 is mounted to the chassis 113, the wall portion 122 of the holder 120 is inserted into a mounting hole 113H from the front side of the chassis 113 . Thereby, the outer surface of the box-like portion 121 becomes in contact with the opening edge of the mounting hole 113H on the front surface of the chassis 113, while the retaining protrusions 130 are locked by the opening edge of the mounting hole 113H on the back surface<br>
 <br>
of the chassis 113. Thus, the chassis 113 is sandwiched between the engaging surfaces 130 on the front side and the retaining protrusions 130 on the back side. Thereby, the holder 120 is fixed to the chassis 113 so that its movement in the mounting direction (i.e., the through direction of the mounting hole 113H) is restricted. Then, the mounting of the relay connector 114 to the chassis 113 is completed. When the relay connector 114 is attached to the chassis 113, the box-like portion 121 as the front end portion of the holder 120 projects (or is exposed) to the front side of the chassis 113 while the wall portion 122 as the back end portion of the holder 120 projects (or is exposed) to the back side of the chassis 113. [0087]  [Discharge Tube 115]<br>
Referring to FIG. 28, each discharge tube 115 is formed of a cold cathode fluorescent tube that includes a generally elongated straight glass tube 134 having a circular cross section, and elongated metallic (e.g., nickel or cobalt metal) outer leads 135 which have a circular cross section and project linearly from the respective ends of the glass tube 134 and coaxially with the glass tube 134. Further included are ferrules 136 attached to the respective end portions of the glass tube 134. Mercury is encapsulated in the glass tube 134. Each end portion of the glass tube 134 is melted into a substantially hemispherical shape by heat, and thereby forms a domed portion. The outer lead 135 penetrates the domed portion.<br>
[0088]  Referring to FIGS. 29 to 31, each ferrule 136 is a single-piece component, which can be formed by bending or<br>
 <br>
hammering a metallic (e.g., stainless steel) plate that is formed into a predetermined shape by punching. The ferrule 136 includes a body 137 and a conductive part 140 . The body 137 generally forms a cylindrical shape concentric with the glass tube 134. The inner diameter of the body 137 is set to be slightly larger than the outer diameter of the glass tube 134.<br>
[0089] Three pairs of elastic gripping parts 138A, 138B are formed on the body 137 by making slit-like cuts in portions thereof, which are arranged at even angular intervals along the circumferential direction.<br>
A first elastic gripping part 138A, i.e., one of a pair of elastic gripping parts 138A, 138B, is generally formed as a cantilevered portion extending posteriorly (specifically, in an oblique direction slightly leaning radially inwardly), which is capable of elastic and radial deflection with a supported point on its proximal end (or anterior end) . A curved portion 139 is formed on the distal end portion (or posterior end portion) of the first elastic gripping part 138A, so as to curve in an oblique direction leaning radially outwardly. The outer surface of the curve (or inwardly facing surface) of the curved portion 139 is provided as a contact point when abutting on the outer circumferential surface of the glass tube 134 . The imaginary line that connects the contact points provided on the three first elastic gripping parts 138A forms a circle concentric with the body 137. The diameter of the imaginary circle, when the first elastic gripping parts 138A are not forced into elastic deflection or are in a free state, is set to be smaller than the outer diameter<br>
 <br>
of the glass tube 134.<br>
[0090] A second elastic gripping part 138B, i.e., the other of the pair of elastic gripping parts 138A, 138B, is arranged circumf erentially adjacent to the first elastic gripping part 138A, and is generally formed as a cantilevered portion extending anteriorly or reversely from the first elastic gripping part 138A (specifically, in an oblique direction slightly leaning radially inwardly), which is capable of elastic and radial deflection with a supported point on its proximal end (or posterior end) . The distal end of the second elastic gripping part 138B is provided as a contact point when abutting on the outer circumferential surface of the glass tube 134. The imaginary line that connects the contact points provided on the three second elastic gripping parts 138B forms a circle concentric with the body 137. The diameter of the imaginary circle, when the second elastic gripping parts 138B are not forced into elastic deflection or are in a free state, is set to be smaller than the outer diameter of the glass tube 134.<br>
[0091] On the body 137, a pair of protector parts are formed as cantilevered portions protruding anteriorly from the anterior end edge thereof. The pair of protector parts are arranged circumf erentially spaced apart, and extend linearly from the body 137 so as to be flush therewith. The conductive part 140 is provided as a cantilevered portion that extends anteriorly from between the pair of protector parts. The conductive part 140 includes a long portion 141 continuous with the anterior end of the body 137, and a cylindrical portion 142 that further projects<br>
 <br>
anteriorly from the anterior end (or distal end) of the long portion 141.<br>
The long portion 141 includes a proximal portion 141a that extends from the body 137 so as to be flush with the body 137 and parallel to the axis thereof, and further includes an intermediate portion 141b that extends radially inwardly from the distal end of the proximal portion 141a toward the axis of the body 137. Further included is a distal portion 141c that extends from the distal end of the intermediate portion 141b and parallel to the axis of the body 137. The cylindrical portion 142 is connected to the distal end of the distal portion 141c. The width of the long portion 141 is set to be sufficiently small for the length of the long portion 141. Therefore, the long portion 141 is capable of elastic deformation in the radial direction of the body 137, elastic deformation in a direction intersecting with the radial direction (and intersecting with the longitudinal direction of the long portion 141), and elastic torsional deformation around the long portion 141 itself as the axis.<br>
The cylindrical portion 142, which can be formed by bending a portion laterally extending from the distal end of the long portion 141 into a cylindrical shape, is arranged substantially coaxially with the body 137. The cylindrical portion 142 is capable of displacement around the axis of the ferrule 136 and radial displacement, due to elastic deflection of the long portion 141. [0092]  [Attachment of Ferrule 136 to Glass Tube 134]<br>
Next, an assembling process for attaching a ferrule 136 to<br>
 <br>
a glass tube 134 will be explained.<br>
During the assembling process, while a ferrule 136 and a glass tube 134 are held by respective holding devices (not shown) , the ferrule 136 and the glass tube 134 are moved relatively and coaxially so as to approach each other. Thereby, the body 137 is fitted onto the glass tube 134. When the body 137 begins engagement, the contact points provided on the distal end portions of the three pairs of elastic gripping parts 138A, 138B have elastic contact with the outer circumference of the glass tube 134. The contact points slide on the outer circumferential surface of the glass tube 134, as the assembling process proceeds. Then, the tip of the outer lead 135 having passed through the body 137 begins to enter the hollow of the cylindrical portion 142. When both of the holding devices have thereafter reached predetermined final positions, the ferrule 136 and the glass tube 134 are axially positioned in proper positions, resulting in the tip end portion of the outer lead 135 circumferentially surrounded by the cylindrical portion 142. At the time, the tip end portion of the outer lead 135 will not greatly protrude from the anterior end of the cylindrical portion 142. That is, it slightly protrudes out of the cylindrical portion 142, or is aligned with the anterior end of the cylindrical portion 142, or alternatively it is located within the cylindrical portion 142.<br>
Thereafter, the cylindrical portion 142 is clamped so as to deform with diameter reduction. After being clamped, the cylindrical portion 142 is electrically conductively fixed to the outer lead 135 by welding, and consequently the ferrule 136 is<br>
 <br>
integrated with the glass tube 134. Then, the assembling process terminates, and the discharge tube 115 is completed.<br>
When the ferrule 136 is attached to the glass tube 134, the body 137 is concentrically held on the glass tube 134 due to the elastic holding function of the three pairs of elastic gripping parts 138A, 138B. A gap (airspace) is secured between the outer circumference of the glass tube 134 and the inner circumference of the body 137, so as to extend over the substantially entire circumference.<br>
[0093] Instead of the cylindrical portion 142, a U-shaped connecting portion 142a may be provided as shown in FIGS. 40 and 41. In this case, after a glass tube 134 is fitted into a ferrule 136, the U-shaped connecting portion 142a is bended so as to hug the outer lead 135, in order to achieve electrical connection between the outer lead 135 and the connecting portion 142a. According to the embodiment thus including the bendable U-shaped connecting portion 142a, electrical connectivity with the outer lead 135 can be further improved. [0094]  [Mounting of Discharge Tube 115 to Relay Connectors 114]<br>
The discharge tube 115, thus assembled, is fixed to relay connectors 114. At the time of fixation, the discharge tube 115 held in a horizontal position is moved toward the front face of the chassis 113, and the end portions and the ferrules 136 of the glass tube 134 are fitted into the container rooms 123 of the relay connectors 114 from the front side. At the time, the pair of elastic pressing parts 132 are pushed by the body 137 of the ferrule 136 so as to open vertically due to elastic deflection. After<br>
 <br>
the body 137 has passed through the shortest-distance portions of the pair of elastic pressing parts 132, the body 137 is pulled deep into the container room 123 due to elastic restoring forces of the elastic pressing parts 132, resulting in the body 137 abutting on the bottom of the container room 123. Then, the mounting of the discharge tube 115 is completed.<br>
[0095] The discharge tube 115 thus mounted is held by the pairs of elastic pressing parts 132 at its end portions, and consequently is fixed to the chassis 113 via the relay terminals 131 and the holders 120 provided as the relay terminal 131 mounting bases. At the time, the weight of the discharge tube 115 is received solely by the chassis 113 via the relay connectors 114. That is, the outer leads 135 will not be under load due to the weight of the discharge tube 115.<br>
[0096] The pair of elastic pressing parts 132 can have elastic contact with the outer circumferential surface of the body 137, and thereby the outer lead 135 is electrically conductTVPIy connected to the relay terminal 131 via the ferrule 136. Further, the glass tube 134 is held due to elastic restoring forces of the pair of elastic pressing parts 132, so as to be pressed against the concave portion 127 of the stopper 12 6. Therefore, when viewed along the axial direction of the discharge tube 115, the body 137 appears to be positioned so as to partially overlap with the stopper 126. That is, the end edge of the body 137 on the opposite side of the conductive part 140 is axially positioned in proximity to the stopper 126 so as to be partially faced therewith.<br>
[0097]  The extended portion 129 is formed on the outer surface<br>
 <br>
of the holder 120, which is perpendicular to the surface of the chassis 113 and includes the escape opening 125 of the container room 123, so as to protrude from between the chassis 113 and the escape opening 125 and extend along the surface of the chassis 113. This results in a long creepage distance from the inside of the container room 123 to the front surface of the chassis 113. Thereby, a leak, from the discharge tube 115 held in the container room 123 to the chassis 113 outside the holder 120, can be prevented. [0098]  [Overview of Power Board 116]<br>
As shown in FIG. 32, each power board 116 includes a circuit board 117 having a circuit formed on its back surface (i.e., the surface on the opposite side of the chassis 113), electronic components 119 mounted on the back surface of the circuit board 117, and a plurality of on-board connectors 118 mounted on the back surface of the circuit board 117.<br>
The circuit board 117 has a vertically-elongated rectangular shape as a whole, and is formed using a phenolic paper-base copper-clad laminated board (known as a phenolic paper) , A plurality of fitting holes 117H having a vertically-elongated rectangular shape are formed through the circuit board 117 so as to extend from the front side to the back side. The plurality of fitting holes 117H are arranged vertically along the lateral side edge of the circuit board 117 so as to correspond to the above-described relay terminals 131 (or relay connectors 114). Each on-board connector 118 includes a housing made of synthetic resin, and an output terminal (not shown) that is completely<br>
 <br>
contained in the housing and made of metal (e.g., nickel silver). The on-board connectors 118 are arranged along the lateral side edge of the circuit board 117 so as to correspond to the respective fitting holes 117H.' A fitting space (not shown) is formed on the outer surface of the housing so as to correspond to the fitting hole 117H, and the output terminal is partly exposed to the fitting space.<br>
[0099] While the circuit board 117 is kept parallel to the chassis 113, the power board 116 is moved toward the chassis 113 from the back side and is fixed thereto. At the time of fixation, the wall portions 122 of the relay connectors 114 and the board connecting portions 133 arranged along the wall portions 122 penetrate the circuit board 117 through the fitting holes 117H and are inserted into the engaging recesses 127 of the on-board connectors 118. Thereby, the on-board connectors 118 are fitted onto the relay connectors 114, and the output terminals are conductively connected to the relay terminals 131. [0100]  [Operational Effects of Embodiment 4]<br>
In the present embodiment 4, when a discharge tube 115 is supported on relay connectors 114, the stoppers 126 lock the ferrules 136. Therefore, the discharge tube 115 is secure from axial movement relative to the relay connectors 114. That is, if a force is applied to the discharge tube 115 so as to cause movement to the right, the stopper 126 catches the left-adjacent ferrule 136 attached on the left end portion of the discharge tube 115 so that the movement of the discharge tube 115 to the right is restricted.  If a force is applied to the discharge tube 115<br>
 <br>
so as to cause movement to the left, the stopper 126 catches the right-adjacent ferrule 136 attached on the right end portion of the discharge tube 115 so that the movement of the discharge tube 115 to the left is restricted. Thus, the axial movement of the discharge tube 115 to either right or left is restricted, and therefore the tip of the outer lead 135 is secure from hitting the wall 122 of the container room 123 on the opposite side of the escape opening 125.<br>
[0101] The stopper 126 can engage with and lock the end edge of the ferrule 136, and therefore a hole that can engage with the stopper 126 is not required to be formed on the outer circumference of the ferrule 136. Thereby, processing cost can be reduced, and reduction in strength of the ferrule 136 can be prevented.<br>
In the case of a construction in which a stopper 126 can engage with the end edge of a ferrule 136 on the side of the conductive part 140, the conductive part 140 extending from the end edge of the ferrule 136 may preclude the end edge of the ferriil e 136 from engaging with the stopper 126, when the ferrule 136 is attached at some angle about its axis. However, in the present embodiment 4, the stopper 126 is arranged to engage with the end edge on the opposite side of the conductive part 140. Therefore, the conductive part 140 will not preclude the ferrule 136 from engaging with the stopper 126, and consequently the ferrule 136 can infallibly engage with the stopper 126.<br>
[0102] The conductive part 140 includes a cylindrical portion 142, which can be circumferentially connected to the outer lead 135 so as to surround it.  Thereby, the conductive part 140 can<br>
 <br>
be prevented from disengaging from the outer lead 135.  That is,<br>
the cylindrical portion 142 will not disengage from the outer lead<br>
135 when the cylindrical portion 142 is clamped.  Therefore, the<br>
conductive part 140 can be infallibly connected to the outer lead<br>
135.<br>
[0103]  The margin for engagement of a ferrule 136 with a stopper<br>
126	corresponds to half of the dimensional difference between the<br>
outer diameters of the glass tube 134 and the ferrule 136. In<br>
the present embodiment 4, ferrules 136 are concentrically held<br>
on a glass tube 134 due to the elastic gripping parts 138A, 138B.<br>
Therefore, if the ferrule 136 is set to be large, a large<br>
dimensional difference can be secured between the inner diameter<br>
thereof and the outer diameter of the glass tube 134. Thereby,<br>
the margin for engagement of the ferrule 136 with the stopper 126<br>
can be increased, resulting in reliable restriction of movement<br>
of the discharge tube 115.<br>
[0104] The concave portion 127 is formed on a stopper 1^6, so as to abut on the outer circumference of a glass tube 134 when the ferrule 136 engages with the stopper 126. Further, the pair of elastic pressing parts 132 capable of pressing the discharge tube 115 toward the concave portion 127 side are provided in the relay connector 114. Specifically, the pair of elastic pressing parts 132 press the discharge tube 115 toward the concave portion<br>
127	side, obliquely from above and obliquely from below, i.e.,<br>
vertically symmetrically. Thereby, the glass tube 134 is<br>
prevented from disengaging from the concave portion 127, and<br>
therefore the engagement of the ferrule 136 with the stopper 126<br>
 <br>
can be reliably maintained.<br>
[0105] The relay connector 114 is formed by mounting a relay terminal 131 in a holder 120 made of synthetic resin. In the present embodiment 4, the stopper 12 6 is formed on the synthetic-resin holder 120. Therefore, a stopper is not required to be formed on the relay terminal 131, and thereby the material for manufacturing the relay terminals 131 can be reduced. Considering that the material cost for synthetic resin is generally lower than that for metal, the material cost for relay connectors 114 can be reduced according to the present embodiment 4. [0106]  <embodiment><br>
Next, an embodiment 5 of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 33 to 39. In the present embodiment 5, the constructions of means for supporting a discharge tube 115 differ from those of the above embodiment 4. The other constructions are similar to the above embodiment 4, Therefore, the same constructions are designated by the same symbols, and explanations for the constructions, operations and effects thereof are omitted. [0107]  [Overview of Grounding Member 150]<br>
In the above embodiment 4, the end portions of a discharge tube 115 are supported by relay connectors 114, each of which includes a holder 120 and a relay terminal 131. In the present embodiment 5, as shown in FIGS. 33 and 34, one of the end portions of a discharge tube 115 is supported by the same relay connector 114 as the embodiment 4, while the other end portion of the<br>
 <br>
discharge tube 115 is supported by a grounding member 150. [0108] As shown in FIG. 36, the grounding member 150 includes an elongated support plate 151 fixed to the chassis 113 so as to be along one of the lateral edge portions thereof, and further includes a plurality of grounding terminals 152 conductively mounted on the front surface of the support plate 151. Mounting holes 151H are formed through the support plate 151 so as to correspond three-to-one with the grounding terminals 152. The support plate 151 is formed of a substrate or a metallic plate.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIGS. 37 and 38, each grounding terminal 152, which can be formed by bending a metallic (e.g., nickel silver) plate that is formed into a predetermined shape by punching, includes a base portion 153 and a pair of elastic pressing parts 154 which extend vertically symmetrically from the respective upper and lower edge portions of the base portion 153 to the front side. Further included is a stopper 155 (corresponding to a movement restricting portion of the present invention) that extends from one of the lateral edge portions of the base portion 153 to the front side.<br>
The pair of elastic pressing parts 154 are provided on the lateral edge portion on the opposite side of the stopper 155, so as to form bulging curves toward each other. The elastic pressing parts 154 are capable of elastic deflection so as to increase the distance therebetween. The minimum distance between the pair of elastic pressing parts 154, when the elastic pressing parts 154 are free from elastic deflection, is set to be smaller than the outer diameter of the glass tube 134 of a discharge tube 115.<br>
 <br>
[0109] The stopper 155 is raised from the base portion 153, so as to form a right angle with the axis of the discharge tube 115. A concave portion 156 is formed on the stopper 155, so as to sag in a substantially circular arc. On a relay connector 114 of the embodiment 4, a pair of guiding portions 128 are raised from the respective upper and lower sides of the concave portion 127 of the stopper 126. However, in the present embodiment 5, the heights of portions raised from the respective upper and lower sides of the concave portion 156 of the base portion 153 are reduced to be short. That is, means corresponding the guiding portions 128 of the embodiment 4 are not provided. Therefore, metallic material required for grounding terminals 152 can be reduced, compared to including guiding portions.<br>
[0110] Three leg portions 157 are further formed on the base portion 153, so as to be integrated therewith. Two of the three leg portions 157 are provided between the elastic pressing parts 154 and the stopper 155, so as to project from the respective upper and lower edge portions of the base portion 153 to the opposite side of the elastic pressing parts 154 or the stopper 155 (i.e., to the hack side). The remaining one of the leg portions 157 is provided on the lateral edge of the base portion 153 on the opposite side of the stopper 155, so as to project from the intermediate position between the elastic pressing parts 154 to the opposite side of the elastic pressing parts 154 or the stopper 155 (i.e., to the bac]
[0111] The grounding terminal 152 is not housed in a member such as a plastic housing, i.e., barely provided, and is conductively<br>
 <br>
fixed to the support plate 151 by soldering or the like so that its leg portions 157 penetrate through the mounting holes 151H (See FIG. 39). Thus, the plurality of grounding terminals 152 are mounted to the common support plate 151, and thereby are conductively connected to one another via the support plate 151. Power boards are not connected to the grounding members 150, and the support plate 151 is conductively connected to the chassis. [0112] [Mounting of Discharge Tube 115 to Grounding Terminal 152] When a discharge tube 115 is fixed to a grounding terminal 152, the discharge tube 115 held in a horizontal position is moved toward the front face of the chassis 113, and the end portion and the ferrule 136 of the glass tube 134 are fitted between the pair of upper and lower elastic pressing parts 154 from the front side. At the time, the pair of elastic pressing parts 154 are pushed by the body 137 of the ferrule 136 so as to open vertically due to elastic deflection. After the body 137 has passed through the shortest-distance portions of the pair of elastic pressing parts 154, the body 137 is pulled toward the base portion 153 side due to elastic restoring forces of the elastic pressing parts 154, resulting in the body 137 abutting on the base portion 153. Then, the fixation of the discharge tube 115 is completed. The other end portion of the discharge tube 115 is fixed to a relay connector 114 in a similar manner to the above embodiment 4. [0113] The discharge tube 115 thus mounted is supported by the relay connector 114 and the grounding member 150 at its respective end portions. The pairs of elastic pressing parts 132, 154 can have elastic contact with the outer circumferential surfaces of<br>
 <br>
the bodies 137 of the ferrules 136, and thereby the outer leads 135 are electrically conductively connected to the relay terminal 131 and the grounding terminal 152 via the ferrules 136.  Further, the glass tube 134 is held due to elastic restoring forces of the pairs of elastic pressing parts 154, so as to be pressed against the concave portions 127, 156 of the stoppers 126, 155.  Therefore, when viewed along the axial direction of the discharge tube 115, the body 137 appears to be positioned so as to partially overlap with the stopper 126 or 155.  That is, the end edge of the body 137 on the opposite side of the conductive part 40 is axially positioned in proximity to the stopper 126 or 155 so as to be partially faced therewith.<br>
[0114] As shown in FIGS. 42 and 43, protector portions 551 may be provided on the grounding terminal 152 . Each protector portion 551 includes a restricting portion 552 for an elastic pressing part, and further includes an abutting portion 553 for abutting on the support plate. When the grounding terminal 152 is mounted and fixed to the support plate 151, the abutting portions 553 abut on or are located close to the support plate 151. If some kind of external force is applied to the elastic pressing parts 154 so that they are pushed to open, they first become in contact with the restricting portions 553 during the course of opening. The abutting portions 553 serve as supports for preventing the protector portions 551 from collapsing, when an additional load is thereafter applied. The protector portions 551 are connected to the feet of the elastic pressing parts 154, and therefore the abutting portions 553 should be formed lateral to the connection<br>
 <br>
part in order that the abutting portions 553 work.  Note that abutting portions 553 located at a longer distance from the connection part are more effective. [0115]  [Operational Effects of Embodiment 5]<br>
In the present embodiment 5, when a discharge tube 115 is supported on a relay connector 114 and a grounding member 150, the stopper 126 of the holder 120 and the stopper 155 of the grounding terminal 152 lock the ferrules 136 on the respective ends of the discharge tube 115. Therefore, the discharge tube 115 is secure from axial movement relative to the relay connector 114.<br>
That is, if a force is applied to the discharge tube 115 so as to cause movement from the relay connector 114 side to the grounding member 150 side, the ferrule 136 attached on the end portion of the discharge tube 115 on the relay connector 114 side is caught by the stopper 126 of the holder 120 so that the movement of the discharge tube 115 to the grounding member 150 side is restricted. If a force is applied to the discharge tube 115 so as to cause movement from the grounding member 150 side to the relay connector 114 side, the ferrule 136 attached on the end portion of the discharge tube 115 on the grounding member 150 side is caught by the stopper 155 of the grounding terminal 152 so that the movement of the discharge tube 115 to the relay connector 114 side is restricted. Thus, the axial movement of the discharge tube 115 to either right or left is restricted, and therefore the tip of the outer lead 135 is secure from hitting the wall of the container room 123 on the opposite side of the escape opening 125<br>
 <br>
or hitting the sidewall of the chassis 113.<br>
[0116] The concave portion 156 is formed on the stopper 155 of a grounding terminal 150, so as to abut on the outer circumference of a glass tube 134 when the ferrule 136 is engaged with the stopper 155. Further, the pair of elastic pressing parts 154 capable of pressing the discharge tube 115 toward the concave portion 156 side are provided on the grounding terminal 152. Specifically, the pair of elastic pressing parts 154 press the discharge tube 115 toward the concave portion 156 side, obliquely from above and obliquely from below, i.e., vertically symmetrically. Thereby, the glass tube 134 is prevented from disengaging from the concave portion 156, and therefore the engagement of the ferrule 136 with the stopper 155 can be reliably maintained.<br>
On the grounding member 150, the stoppers 155 are integrated with the respective grounding terminals 152 provided as means for conductive connection to the ferrules 136. Thereby, the number of components can be reduced in the present embodim_ent 5, compared to including stoppers provided as separate members from the grounding terminals.<br>
[0117] The plurality of discharge tubes 115 are short-circuited through the grounding member 150 connected to the ferrule 136 attached on the end of each discharge tube 115, and are collectively grounded. The plurality of grounding terminals 152 of the grounding member 150 are not required to be insulated from one another. Therefore, insulating members, which surround the grounding terminals 152 for insulation purposes or separate the grounding terminals 152, are not necessary.  That is, the number<br>
 <br>
of components can be reduced in the present embodiment, compared<br>
to a construction in which each discharge tube 115 connected to<br>
relay connectors 114 at both end portions thereof is separately<br>
grounded.<br>

direction of the on-board connectors, and output terminals having<br>
a plate-like shape parallel to the array direction may be provided.<br>
(5)	The mounting direction of the discharge tube to the relay<br>
connectors may differ from the mounting direction of the on-board<br>
connectors to the relay connectors.  For example, the mounting<br>
 <br>
direction of the discharge tube to the relay connectors may be substantially parallel to the surface of the chassis, while the mounting direction of the on-board connectors to the relay connectors is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis. Conversely, the mounting direction of the on-board connectors to the relay connectors may be substantially parallel to the surface of the chassis, while the mounting direction of the discharge tube to the relay connectors is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the chassis.<br>

 <br>
power source and the outer lead.<br>
