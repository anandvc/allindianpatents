				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to method and nodes for handling calls in an<br>
Intelligent telecommunications network. More particularly, the invention relates to method<br>
and nodes for providing interaction between CAMEL and eMLPP services in an<br>
Intelligent mobile telecommunications network.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Network operators have provided methods for enabling privileged people to<br>
access the mobile network services by overriding any existing call connection, for instance<br>
in cases in which the mobile network suffers from congestion due to a critical event.<br>
In particular, service providers, based on the subscriber's need, set a maximum<br>
precedence level of the subscriber at the subscription time. When accessing the mobile<br>
network, the subscriber can select a precedence level up to and including the maximum<br>
precedence level he has subscribed to, on a per-call basis. According to the precedence<br>
level, the subscriber can benefit of a priority over other subscribers for accessing the same<br>
service or foran existing call directed to the same destination.<br>
The enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption service (eMLPP) is<br>
currently used in mobile telecommunications networks for providing different levels of<br>
precedence for call set-up and for call continuity in case of handover. The technical<br>
specification of the eMLPP service is disclosed in 3GPP TS 23.067, v.6.1.0, which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
A pre-emption service may regard a resource or a called party. In a resource pre-<br>
emption, a call of a low priority user can be terminated so that resources can be made<br>
available for a call of higher priority. A called-party pre-emption can be decided by the<br>
subscriber and can consist in terminating a call to a particular user when a higher priority<br>
call from the subscriber is directed towards that specific user.<br>
There are seven eMLPP priority levels which, in descending order, read as A, B,<br>
0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. A and B are internal values of the Mobile Switching Centre and are<br>
mapped to value 0 when sent over signalling protocols. Value 4 represents the lowest<br>
priority level.<br>
2<br><br>
The MSC/VLR node for mobile originating and mobile terminating calls<br>
allocates the priority that is provided to the radio access network and to the core network.<br>
If a priority has been allocated to the originating subscriber of the call, this priority is also<br>
applied for the connected terminating subscriber.<br>
In mobile-originated calls, the priority level depends on the calling subscriber. If<br>
the user has no eMLPP subscription, the call shall have a default priority level defined in<br>
the network, if the network supports the service. Otherwise, if the user has an eMLPP<br>
subscription, the call shall have the priority level selected by the user at set up or the<br>
priority level predefined by the subscriber as a default priority level upon registration.<br>
In mobile-terminated calls, the priority level depends on the calling party. If the<br>
call is not an ISDN MLPP call, i.e. no priority level is defined, the call shall be treated in<br>
the mobile network with a default priority level. If the call is an ISDN MLPP call, the call<br>
shall be treated with the priority level provided by the interfacing network.<br>
As regards mobile-to-mobile calls in the same network or in case of roaming, the<br>
priority is treated for the calling subscriber as for mobile originated calls and for the called<br>
subscriber as for mobile terminated calls.<br>
Information concerning the maximum priority level that a subscriber is entitled to<br>
use at call establishment is stored in the Home Location Register (HLR).<br>
If the provisioning state for eMLPP is set to "Provisioned" then, when the<br>
subscriber registers with a Visitor Location Register (VLR), the Home Location Register<br>
(HLR) sends information about the logical state of eMLPP, the maximum priority level<br>
and the default priority level to the VLR, which stores such information.<br>
The priority level, or level of precedence, and some other eMLPP parameters are<br>
carried in the signalling protocol, e.g. ISUP, for intra- and inter- network communications.<br>
An intelligent network (IN) is a telecommunications network wherein intelligence<br>
is taken out of a switch and placed in a controller that then provides the logic for the IN<br>
and thus the intelligence. This separation provides the network operator with the means to<br>
develop and control services more efficiently and allow to introduce new capabilities more<br>
rapidly into the network. Once introduced, services can be easily customized to meet<br>
individual customer's needs.<br>
Customised Application for Mobile Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) is an IN feature<br>
that provides mechanisms to support services of operators that are not covered by<br>
standardised services when roaming outside the Home Public Land Mobile Network<br>
3<br><br>
(HPLMN). A Service Control Point (SCP) such as a GSM Service Control Function<br>
(gsmSCF) is the functional entity containing the CAMEL logic.<br>
A drawback of current CAMEL networks is that the gsmSCF cannot interact<br>
with the eMLPP-defined level of precedence, regardless of whether the subscriber is<br>
roaming in a partner network or is using the network of his own operator.<br>
Moreover, the priority assigned at dialogue level for the branch of the call toward<br>
and from the current gsmSCF is not derived from the eMLPP precedence level already<br>
established for that process.<br>
In summary, there exist no methods or systems that allow to handle a call in an<br>
Intelligent telecommunication network according to a priority already set for this call or<br>
according to priority information available within the IN network or to handle<br>
communication between nodes in an intelligent network according to those<br>
aforementioned priority information.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a method and a node that overcome<br>
the above drawbacks.<br>
It is an object to maintain any precedence information associated with a call in an<br>
Intelligent Network (IN) and to derive priority information from said precedence<br>
information for call handling according to the derived priority.<br>
A further object of the invention is to allow an IN controller to modify existing<br>
priority information or to prioritise its internal processes, for instance to give priority to a<br>
specific IN request over other IN service requests.<br>
The above aim and other objects which will become apparent hereinafter are<br>
achieved by a method for handling a call in an Intelligent telecommunications network,<br>
wherein the following steps are performed by a controller providing logic for the<br>
Intelligent telecommunications network:<br>
-	receiving a first information element relating to a precedence indicator of a call<br>
prioritization service,<br>
-	sending a second information element derived from the first information<br>
element to a switch for the handling of the call according to a priority indicated by the<br>
second information element.<br>
4<br><br>
Preferably, the second information element is derived from the first information<br>
element by determining a priority according to the precedence indicator, analyzing if the<br>
determined priority is in accordance with at least one priority requirement determinable by<br>
the controller, and setting the priority indicated by the second information element<br>
according to a result of the analysis.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the first information element and<br>
the second information element can have the same data format with the priority indicated<br>
by the second information element being different from the priority according to the<br>
precedence indicator as a result of the step of setting.<br>
In different embodiments of the invention, the second information element is<br>
derived from the first information element by copying the first information element to the<br>
second information element.<br>
Advantageously, the first information element is received from the switch in a<br>
notification message and the second information element is sent to the switch in an<br>
instruction message instructing said switch to handle the call according to the priority<br>
indicated by the second information element.<br>
The first information element can also be received from a home database by a<br>
response message responsive to an interrogation message sent from the controller to the<br>
home database.<br>
Preferably, in the above step of determining, the priority is determined according<br>
to the precedence indicator of the first information element received from the switch, the<br>
priority requirement is determined as a priority according to the precedence indicator of<br>
the first information element received from the home database. In the above step of<br>
setting, the priority indicated by the second information element is set to the priority<br>
according to the priority requirement if the priority according to the priority requirement<br>
exceeds the priority indicated by the precedence indicator of the first information element<br>
received from the switch.<br>
The call may be initiated by the controller, e.g. for a priority wake-up call, and<br>
the sending of the interrogation message is performed in response to such initiation. In this<br>
case the first information element is preferably received from the home database by the<br>
above response message.<br>
5<br><br>
Alternatively, the call may be indicated to be handled at the switch effecting the<br>
sending of the notification message to the controller, e.g. in mobile terminating or mobile<br>
originating or forwarding calls.<br>
According to the preferred embodiments of the invention, the Intelligent<br>
telecommunication network comprises a Customised Application for Mobile Enhanced<br>
Logic CAMEL telecommunication network with the controller comprising a GSM Service<br>
Control Function gsmSCF. The call prioritization service is an enhanced Multi Level<br>
Precedence and Pre-emption service eMLPP and the precedence indicator is an eMLPP<br>
Level of Precedence. The first information element is preferably identical to the eMLPP<br>
Level of Precedence associated with the call handled by the switch (if applicable) or as<br>
stored at the home data base, and the second information element is preferably an eMLPP<br>
Level of Precedence derived from the first information element according to the invention,<br>
e.g. by copying or modifying.<br>
Moreover, the controller is adapted to process at least one message, preferably all,<br>
of a group of messages comprising:<br>
-	the interrogation message being an Any Time Subscription interrogation ATSI<br>
message adapted for requesting the precedence indicator,<br>
-	the response message being an ATSI response message adapted to comprise the<br>
first information element,<br>
-	the notification message being an Initial Detection Point CAP message adapted<br>
to comprise the first information element, and<br>
-	the instruction message being a CAMEL Application Part CAP message being<br>
selected from at least one Connect message CON or a Continue With Argument CWA<br>
message adapted to comprise the second information element.<br>
The sending of the second information element may be effected according to the<br>
priority indicated by the second information element.<br>
Moreover, the first information element may be received by at least one of the<br>
notification message and response message transmitted according to the priority associated<br>
with the precedence indicator. Namely, the first information element may be received on<br>
application level in the notification and/or response message and the sending side (home<br>
database or switch) to determine from the first information element value the priority on at<br>
least one lower protocol level (transport layer or TCAP).<br>
6<br><br>
The invention is furthermore embodied in devices like a controller and a switch<br>
and a system comprising said devices. The devices comprise sub-units like a receiver, a<br>
transmitter, or a processor. The sub-units can be separate entities or may be combined. An<br>
example for a combined sub-unit is a transceiver combining a transmitter and a receiver. A<br>
sub-unit may be build-up by further sub-units, e.g. a first sub-unit suited for wired<br>
communication and second sub-unit suited for wireless communication.<br>
The controller providing logic for an Intelligent telecommunications network<br>
comprises a receiver for receiving messages, a transmitter for sending messages and a<br>
processor for processing messages and information, wherein<br>
-	the receiver is adapted to receive a first information element relating to a<br>
precedence indicator of a call prioritization service,<br>
-	the processor is adapted to derive a second information element from the first<br>
information element for instructing a switch to handle a call according to a priority<br>
indicated by the second information element,<br>
-	the transmitter is adapted to send the second information element to the switch.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to derive the second information<br>
element from the first information element by<br>
-	determining a priority according to the precedence indicator,<br>
-	analyzing if the determined priority is in accordance with at least one priority<br>
requirement determinable by the controller, and<br>
-	setting the priority indicated by the second information element according to a<br>
result of said analysis.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to process the first information<br>
element and the second information element to have the same data format with the priority<br>
indicated by the second information element being different from the priority according to<br>
the precedence indicator as a result of the step of setting.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to derive the second information<br>
element from the first information element by copying the first information element to the<br>
second information element.<br>
Furthermore, the receiver may be adapted to receive the first information element<br>
from the switch in a notification message, the processor maybe adapted to generate an<br>
instruction message comprising the second information element, and the transmitter may<br>
7<br><br>
be adapted to send the instruction message to said switch for instructing said switch to<br>
handle the call according to the priority indicated by the second information element.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to generate an interrogation message<br>
for requesting the first information element from a home data base, the transmitter may be<br>
adapted to sent the interrogation message to the home data base, and the receiver may be<br>
adapted to receive the first information element from a home database by a response<br>
message responsive to the interrogation message sent to the home database.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to modify a priority. In particular the<br>
processor may be adapted to, in said step of determining, to determine said priority<br>
according to the precedence indicator of the first information element received from said<br>
switch, to determine said priority requirement as a priority according to the precedence<br>
indicator of the first information element received from the home database, and, in said<br>
step of setting, to set the priority indicated by the second information element to the<br>
priority according to the priority requirement if the priority according to the priority<br>
requirement exceeds the priority indicated by the precedence indicator of the first<br>
information element received from the switch.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to initiate said call, wherein the<br>
processor may be adapted to initiate the sending of the interrogation message in response<br>
to said initiation, and the transmitter may be adapted to send the interrogation message to<br>
the switch.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to process at least one message of a<br>
group of messages comprising:<br>
-	the interrogation message being an Any Time Subscription interrogation ATSI<br>
message adapted for requesting the precedence indicator,<br>
-	the response message being an ATSI response message adapted to comprise the<br>
first information element,<br>
-	the notification message being an Initial Detection Point CAP message adapted<br>
to comprise the first information element, and<br>

message adapted to comprise the second information element.<br>
Furthermore, the processor may be adapted to initiate the sending of the second<br>
information element according to the priority indicated by the second information element.<br>
8<br><br>
The aim and objects of the invention are also achieved by a switch for handling a<br>
call in an Intelligent telecommunication network, the switch comprising a receiver for<br>
receiving messages, a transmitter for sending messages and a processor for processing<br>
messages and information, wherein the receiver is adapted to receive an instruction<br>
message from a controller providing logic for the Intelligent telecommunications network,<br>

information element relating to a precedence indicator of a call prioritization service for<br>
instructing the switch to handle the call according to a priority indicated by the second<br>
information element, and- the processor is adapted to initiate a handling of the call<br>
according to the priority indicated by the second information element.<br>
This switch is suitable to interact with the controller according to the invention,<br>
so as to carry out the steps involved by the method according to the invention. For<br>
example, for a mobile terminating or mobile originating or forwarding call being indicated<br>
to be handled by the switch, the processor of the switch may be adapted to generate a<br>
notification message comprising a first information element with the first information<br>
element being derived from a precedence indicator associated with the mobile terminating<br>
or mobile originating or forwarding call indicated to be handled by the switch. The<br>
transmitter of the switch may be adapted to send a notification message comprising the<br>
first information element to the controller. Preferably, the processor of the switch may be<br>
further adapted to determine a priority from the precedence indicator and to initiate a<br>
transmission of the notification message according to said determined priority.<br>
The present invention also concerns computer programs comprising portions of<br>
software codes in order to implement the method as described above when operated at a<br>
processor of a controller or a switch. Such a computer program can be stored on a<br>
computer readable medium. The computer-readable medium can be a permanent or<br>
rewritable memory within the controller or the switch or can be located externally. The<br>
respective computer program can be also transferred to the controller or the switch for<br>
example via a cable or a wireless link as a sequence of signals.<br>
According to a particular aspect of the invention, a computer program is<br>
provided, which is loadable into a processor of a controller providing logic for an<br>
Intelligent telecommunications network, wherein the computer program comprises code<br>
adapted to obtain a first information element relating to a precedence indicator of a call<br>
prioritization service, to derive a second information element from the first information<br>
9<br><br>
element for instructing a switch to handle a call according to a priority indicated by the<br>
second information element, and to initiate a sending of the second information element to<br>
the switch.<br>
A computer program according to a further aspect of the invention is also<br>

apparent from the detailed description of particular but not exclusive embodiments,<br>
illustrated by way of non-limiting examples in the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
While the following description refers to CAMEL networks, it is straightforward<br>
to understand that the present invention can be applied to any Intelligent<br>
telecommunication network without departing from the scope of the invention. As it is<br>
known, an Intelligent Network (IN) is a network architecture connected to either a fixed or<br>
a mobile communication network and in which services are controlled by a separate<br>
10<br><br>
functional unit, hereinafter called a controller or Service Control Function node or Service<br>
Control Point (SCP).<br>
The SCP provides logic for the Intelligent telecommunication network and<br>
interfaces to the fixed or the mobile communication network. In particular, the SCP<br>
interfaces to a serving node of the network by means of a switch adapted to handle calls in<br>
an IN, hereinafter called Service Switching Function node or Service Switching Point<br>
(SSP).<br>
With reference to the figures, the architecture of a CAMEL network in which the<br>
invention is preferably implemented mainly comprises a Home Public Land Mobile<br>
Network HPLMN 10, an interrogating network 11 and a visited network VPLMN 12.<br>
The home network comprises a home database HLR 2, which particularly stores<br>
information about the subscription, the subscriber's identification data and profile, the<br>
services that the subscriber is entitled to and the subscriber's location. In addition, the<br>
HLR 2 stores the CAMEL information relevant to the current subscription (Camel<br>
Subscription Information or CSI), such as Originating CSI (O-CSI), Dialled Services CSI<br>
(D-CSI), Terminating CSI (T-CSI) and VMSC Terminating CSI (VT-CSI), which<br>
information is sent to the visited or the interrogating network in response to location<br>
updates or to requests for routing information.<br>
The home network also comprises a controller (Service Control Point) such as a<br>
GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF), which is a functional entity containing the<br>
CAMEL service logic to implement operator specific services. Although the gsmSCF is<br>
hereinafter considered as being part of the home network, it is clear that the gsmSCF and<br>
the HPLMN can be distinct entities as well, as some countries may require that the<br>
gsmSCF and the HPLMN are controlled by different operators.<br>
The visited network 12 is composed of a number of service areas which are<br>
associated to Mobile service Switching Centres (MSCs) such as MSC 6 and Visitor<br>
Location Registers (VLRs) such as VLR 7. MSC 6 switches speech and data connections<br>
between a Base Station 9, other MSCs, other networks and external non-mobile networks.<br>
VLR 7 stores data about all the users that are roaming within the service area of<br>
MSC 6. In particular, the O-CSI, D-CSI and VT-CSI are stored in VLR 7 as a part of the<br>
subscriber data for subscribers roaming in the VLR area.<br>
The MSC 6 also handles a number of functions associated with mobile<br>
subscribers, such as registration, location updating and handover between a mobile station<br>
11<br><br>
1 and the network. Moreover, MSC 6 supports CAMEL and is able to receive an O-CSI,<br>
D-CSI or VT-CSI from VLR 7 indicating the MSC to request instructions from a Service<br>
Switching Point such as a GSM Service Switching Function (gsmSSF) 8, which interfaces<br>
MSC 6 to gsmSCF 3.<br>
The interrogating network 11 comprises a Gateway Mobile service Switching<br>
Centre GMSC 4, which switches calls to or from other mobile or public telephone<br>
networks and which comprises its own gsmSSF 5 for interfacing with gsmSCF 3.<br>
The serving nodes MSC 6 and GMSC 4 and the location registers communicate<br>
one with another using Mobile Application Part (MAP) messages and the gsmSCF 3 and<br>
gsmSSF 5 and 8 communicate using CAMEL Application Part (CAP) messages.<br>
According to the preferred embodiments of the invention, the CAP operations<br>
comprise a new information element (IE) reserved for the Precedence Indicator of a call<br>
prioritization service, in particular for eMLPP parameters. This information element is<br>
used to notify the gsmSCF about the level of precedence or other eMLPP parameters<br>
already assigned to a certain call or is used by the gsmSCF to modify the condition of<br>
eMLPP service in the core network depending on specific end-user service logic.<br>
The new information element has preferably the bit distribution set forth in Table<br>
1. The precedence level is coded in the first four bits of the first octet, so as to comprise<br>
decimal values from 1 to 5, which correspond to eMLPP priority levels from 4 to 0,<br>
respectively.<br>
Bits 5 and 6 are reserved for the Look ahead For Busy (LFB) feature, through<br>
which a mobile station can look ahead in the mobile network to determine if a call it is<br>
about to place has available resources for call completion with a given priority. Decimal<br>
values from 0 to 2 are set for coding "LFB allowed", "Path reserved" and "LFB not<br>
allowed".<br>

Octets 2 and 3 contain Network Identity (NI) information in which each digit is<br>
coded in binary coded decimal representation from 0 to 9. The first digit of this field is<br>
coded 0 and the Telephony Country Code (TCC) follows in the second to fourth NI digits.<br>
The most significant TCC digit is in the second NI digit, while the least significant digit is<br>
the fourth NI digit.<br>
Finally, the fourth to sixth octet contain a 24-bit pure binary code allocated to an<br>
MLPP service domain, in which bit 7 of octet 4 is the most significant bit and bit 0 of octet<br>
6 is the least significant bit.<br>
A first information element relating to a precedence indicator can be received by<br>
the gsmSCF 3 through a notification message from an IN switch such as the gsmSSF 5,8<br>
and/or through a response message from a home database such as HLR 2 in response to an<br>
interrogation message sent to the HLR, as it will explained hereinafter.<br>
In all cases, the gsmSCF 3 is adapted to send to the gsmSSF 5,8 an instruction<br>
message comprising a second information element derived from the first information<br>
element for instructing the gsmSSF to handle the call according to a priority indicated by<br>
the second information element. Preferably, the sending and transmission of the<br>
instruction message to the gsmSSF 5,8 occurs at the priority according to the second<br>
information element.<br>
The first information element and the second information element may be<br>
identical or different. In particular, the first information element and the second<br>
information element may have the same data format but indicate different priority or vice<br>
versa or may have the same data format and may indicate the same priority. For the latter<br>
example, the gsmSCF 3 may be adapted to copy the first information element to the<br>
second information element. The gsmSCF 3 may analyze if the received first information<br>
element is in accordance with at least one priority requirement like an internal priority<br>
setting of the gsmSCF 3, a priority setting associated to a service or other network-related<br>
priority settings or indications, or a first information element received from the HLR 2 in<br>
addition to a first information element received from the gsmSSF 5,8, and to set the<br>
priority indicated by the second information element according to a result of the analysis.<br>
The first and second information elements that can be communicated accordingly<br>
between the gsmSSF 5 or 8 and the gsmSCF 3 are preferably included in CAP operations,<br>
such as Initial Detection Point (IDP), Connect (CON) or Continue With Argument<br>
(CWA). Accordingly, the gsmSCF 3 is able to use the new information to prioritise the<br>
13<br><br>
related IN service over other IN services. The information may be modified or set by<br>
gsmSCF and returned to the Core Network via a CAP operation, as well as derived for<br>
being used in any requested TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Application Part) service.<br>
The first information element that can be communicated from the HLR 2 to the<br>
gsmSCF 3 is preferably included in a MAP operation.<br>
Given the knowledge of the eMLPP level of precedence in the gsmSSF and/or the<br>
gsmSCF, the priority indicated to TCAP on a per-message transfer basis by TC-users that<br>
invoke TCAP to transport application messages can be derived from such level of<br>
precedence or precedence indicator. Therefore, the priority level indicated by the TC-user<br>
to the TCAP can be dynamically adapted to any changes of the eMLPP level of<br>
precedence.<br>
In other words, from the precedence indicator relating to a first communication<br>
protocol can be derived a priority relating to a second communication protocol (e.g. TCAP<br>
or SCCP). For instance, the TCAP priority can be derived from the knowledge of eMLPP<br>
level of precedence.<br>
With reference to figure 2, the invention is applied to a mobile-originated call. As<br>
a mobile station (MS) 1 having an eMLPP and a CAMEL subscription enters VPLMN 12,<br>
a Location Update procedure is performed (step 201). The HLR 2 provides the MSC/VLR<br>
6 with eMLPP information and CAMEL Subscription Information (CSI).<br>
Then, MS 1 enters in idle mode (step 202). As soon as MS 1 initiates a call (step<br>
203), the eMLPP level of precedence and other relevant parameters are set in the MSC 6<br>
for the requested call (step 204).<br>
Due to CAMEL subscription, the MSC 6 instantiates an internal gsmSSF entity 8<br>
(step 205). Then, the gsmSSF 8 includes the eMLPP level of precedence and any<br>
additional eMLPP information in the new Information Field of a notification message such<br>
as an IDP message as defined above (step 206) and finally sends the IDP message to the<br>
gsmSCF 3.<br>
The eMLPP information is then included by the gsmSCF 3 in form of the second<br>
information element in an instruction message such as a CWA or CON message that is<br>
sent to the gsmSSF 8.<br>
Upon receiving the CON/CWA message (step 208) the gsmSSF 8 and the MSC 6<br>
can continue the call processing with modified information (as received from the gsmSCF<br>
14<br><br>
3) at the DP at which it previously suspended call processing to await gsmSCF<br>
instructions.<br>
In particular, in step 209 the MSC 6 sends an ISDN User Part (ISUP) Initial<br>
Address Message (IAM) to the destination with the eMLPP settings as received from the<br>
gsmSCF3.<br>
According to the eMLPP information received via the IDP, the gsmSCF 3 can<br>
prioritise its internal processes and the dialogue between the gsmSSF and the gsmSCF can<br>
be treated according to the eMLPP level of precedence. When the gsmSSF or the gsmSCF<br>
initiate an IN service, they can use the eMLPP level to derive the priority indication to be<br>
provided to the TCAP service.<br>
Moreover, the gsmSCF can decide how the eMLPP level of precedence and any<br>
other eMLPP information have to be modified for the continuation of the call when call<br>
control is returned to the gsmSSF.<br>
In a second illustrative embodiment of the invention, the gsmSCF assigns the<br>
eMLPP level of precedence and any other eMLPP relevant information to a mobile-<br>
terminated call. The destination mobile station has an eMLPP subscription.<br>
Referring to figures 3 and 4, a call is received at the GMSC 4 by means of an<br>
ISUP IAM and, as an assumption for this particular example, no eMLPP information is<br>
included in the incoming signalling (step 301).<br>
The GMSC 4 performs a first HLR interrogation and receives the CSI from the<br>
HLR 2 (step 302).<br>
Due to CAMEL subscription, the GMSC 4 instantiates an internal gsmSSF entity<br>
5 (step 303) which sends an IDP to the gsmSCF 3 (step 304). In this phase, no information<br>
about eMLPP is notified to the gsmSCF, since such information is not received from the<br>
interworking network. If such information were received in step 301, the IDP would<br>
contain it as described above.<br>
After having received the IDP (step 401) the gsmSCF 3 sends an Any Time<br>
Subscription Interrogation (ATSI) message in order to get eMLPP subscription<br>
information from the HLR 2 (step 402).<br>
Then, the gsmSCF 3 receives the eMLPP data from the HLR (step 406) through a<br>
response message and sends information about the eMLPP level of preference to the<br>
gsmSSF via a CON or CWA message according to the invention (step 407).<br>
15<br><br>
It is to be noted that not exactly the same eMLPP information retrieved from the<br>
HLR is necessarily sent to the gsmSSF. For instance, the gsmSCF may use the information<br>
to check the lowest precedence level that the gsmSCF can assign when modifying or<br>
setting the level of precedence before sending it to the gsmSSF.<br>
It may be further noted, if eMLPP information would have been received at step<br>
301 and would have been sent from the gsmSSF to the gsmSCF at step 304, the gsmSCF<br>
could copy this received eMLPP information into the instruction message leaving out or<br>
ignoring step 306. Alternatively, the gsmSCF could further request eMLPP information<br>
via step 306 and use this eMLPP information received from the HLR as priority<br>
requirement to be compared to the eMLPP information received from gsmSSF and to set<br>
the eMLPP information of the instruction message according to the priority requirement.<br>
After reception of the IAM message of step 307, at this point, the GMSC 4<br>
handles the call according to the eMLPP information received from the gsmSCF 3, in<br>
particular according to the level of precedence which is now set for the call.<br>
The GMSC 4 performs a second HLR interrogation and receives a Mobile Station<br>
Roaming Number (MSRN), in order to address the call to the relevant MSC/VLR.<br>
Finally, the GMSC 4 sends an ISUP IAM to the destination with eMLPP settings<br>
as received from the gsmSCF.<br>
It is seen that not only the eMLPP Level of Precedence can be used to prioritise<br>
the gsmSCF internal processes, but the gsmSCF can also set a Precedence Level and other<br>
eMLPP parameters when a call to a mobile subscriber comes from a network that does not<br>
support the eMLPP service. This is a capability that may be used by service operators to<br>
prioritise the calls directed to a given called subscriber. In fact, the subscription options<br>
can be retrieved from the HLR via a MAP message such as an ATS I request.<br>
Of course, while the above process refers to mobile-terminated calls in GMSC<br>
when the gsmSCF is invoked via a T-CSI, it is straightforward for the skilled in the art that<br>
a similar process may apply to mobile-terminated calls in the MSC/VLR when the<br>
gsmSCF is invoked via VT-CSI, as well as to mobile forwarding calls in MSC/VLR and<br>
GMSC when gsmSCF is invoked, one or more times, due to subscriptions such as O-CSI,<br>
D-CSIorN-CSI.<br>
The invention can be also applied to gsmSCF-initiated calls. In a third preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, when the gsmSCF wishes to originate a new call, the<br>
gsmSCF sends an ATSI message to the HLR in order to get the eMLPP subscription<br>
16<br><br>
information. Then, the gsmSCF starts a new call according to the CAMEL standards, by<br>
sending the sequence of operations ICA (Initiate Call Attempt, for creating a new leg),<br>
RRB (Request Report Basic Call State Model, for arming of call events reporting) and<br>
CWA. The CWA message includes the eMLPP level of precedence and other eMLPP<br>
information as received from the HLR.<br>
Accordingly, the GMSC or the MSC/VLR can set up the eMLPP information<br>
according to the parameters received from the gsmSCF. In particular, the GMSC or the<br>
MSC/VLR constructs an ISUP Initial Address Message using the eMLPP parameters and<br>
sends it to the destination exchange.<br>
It has thus been shown that the present invention fulfils the proposed aim and<br>
objects. In particular, the gsmSCF where the scripts are run can be informed about the<br>
level of precedence defined for a certain call in the core network and can even assign or<br>
modify the level of precedence and other relevant eMLPP information to the call.<br>
The method according to the invention allows to prioritise the processes by the<br>
gsmSCF and derive the precedence on the dialogue between the gsmSSF and the gsmSCF,<br>
even in those cases where the eMLPP information is not modified by the gsmSCF.<br>
In case of mobile-terminated calls in GMSC, operators can use the eMLPP<br>
information to prioritise the calls for a given called subscriber, even when the<br>
interworking network does not completely support eMLPP services.<br>
Similarly, in mobile-forwarding calls in the MSC/VLR or the GMSC, operators<br>
can use the newly added information to prioritise the new call leg that is going to be<br>
established.<br>
In gsmSCF-initiated new calls or gsmSCF-initiated new party calls, operators can<br>
prioritise the calls taking into account the application that is going to be served.<br>
It can be also appreciated that services modelled over eMLPP infrastructures such<br>
as the US Government's feature Wireless Priority Service (WPS) may benefit of the<br>
present invention, thus giving the possibility to interface the WPS with gsmSCF.<br>
The skilled in the art easily understands that the above described steps may be<br>
performed by any hardware and/or software and telecommunications means programmed<br>
through conventional techniques in order to take into account the additional information<br>
and operational data needed by the present invention. The invention is therefore preferably<br>
implemented by introducing new functionality in existing systems, through conventional<br>
17<br><br>
techniques which are clearly in the reach of the average technician and, therefore, are not<br>
hereby discussed in detail.<br>
Clearly, several modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by the<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the<br>
scope of the claims shall not be limited by the illustrations or the preferred embodiments<br>
given in the description in the form of examples, but rather the claims shall encompass all<br>
of the features of patentable novelty that reside in the present invention, including all the<br>
features that would be treated as equivalents by the skilled in the art.<br>
