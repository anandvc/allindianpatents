The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of salts of carboxylic acids and, particularly, salts of amino carboxylic acids, by means of catalytic dehydrogenation effected by reacting the corresponding primary alcohol with an alkaline metal hydroxide in the presence of a copper catalyst.<br>
The salts of the carboxylic acids have numerous applications in many fields; many salts, transformed into the corresponding acids, are used as primary materials in the preparation of pharmaceutical products, agrochemical products and pesticides.<br>
The salts of amino carboxylic acids, such as glycine salts, iminodiacetic acid salts and nitriltriacetic acid salts, are of particular interest.<br>
United States Patent Number 4,782,183 in the name Goto et al describes a method for preparing salts of amino carboxylic acids in which the corresponding amino alcohol is subjected to the action of alkaline metal hydroxides in the presence of a Raney copper catalyst.<br>
Although the use of Raney copper as a catalyst has substantial economic advantages in comparison with the use of noble metal catalysts, an inherent problem with its use lies in the fact that it rapidly becomes poisoned; it has, in fact, been observed that the activity of the copper-based catalyst decreases with repeated use, rapidly increasing costs to economically unacceptable levels.<br>
International patent application no. WO92/06069 describes a method for the production of salts of glycine, iminodiacetic<br>
5<br><br>
acid and nitriltriacetic acid in which monoethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine are brought into contact with an alkaline metal hydroxide in the presence of a Raney copper catalyst, and in which the catalyst is regenerated after each use by treatment with formic acid.<br>
United States Patent Nos. 5,292,936 and 5,367,112, both in<br>
the name of Frenzy, describe a method for catalytic<br>
dehydrogenation using a Raney copper catalyst treated in an<br>
addition reaction using particular metals, such as chrome,<br>
titanium and molybdenum; in this way, it is possible to<br>
prolong significantly the life of the catalyst,' thus making<br>
its use in the industrial production of salts of carboxylic<br>
acids economically advantageous.	i<br>
Other known processes utilize Raney copper as a catalyst in oxidative processes. In particular. United States Patent No. 5,225,592 describes a method for the production of salts of amino carboxylic acids by means of the oxidation of the corresponding alcohol in the presence of alkaline hydroxide and Raney copper with molecular oxygen, or a gas containing molecular oxygen, in which the oxygen partial pressure in the reactor is maintained between approximately 2 to 20 kg/cm2.<br>
Similarly, EP-B-0 506 973 describes a method for the production of salts of amino carboxylic acids by means of the oxidative dehydrogenation of the amino alcohol with a copper catalyst with the addition to the reaction medium of aluminium or an aluminium- containing compound.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method that is simple from the  operative point of view, and particularly advantageous from the economical point of view, which prolongs the life of the catalyst, maintaining the high activity thereof even after several teas of recycling.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method which enables the economical use of a commercial Raney copper oatatyst, which enables the advantageous conversion of amino alcohols of industrial interest into the corresponding carboxylic acids in salt forms.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method for the production of a salt of carboxylic acid such as herein described by catalytic dehydrogenation effected by reacting the corresponding primary alcohol such as herein described in aqueous solution with an alkaline hydroxide in the presence of a copper catalyst, to obtain salt of carboxylic acid characterised in that, before the catalytic dehydrogenation, the mass of reagents comprising the said aqueous solution of primary alcohol is subjected to deoxygenating to reduce the level of dissolved molecular oxygen to less than 0.3 ppm.<br>
The primary alcohols that can be used as starting products in the process of the present invention can be aliphatic, cyclic or aromatic alcohols, and are those that are known to the experts in the field. The toddy requirement that the alcohol and the corresponding carboxylic acid must satisfy is for both to be stable under the severe conditions in which the process of the invention Is conducted.<br><br>
In  particular,  the  method  is  applicable to primary  amino  alcohols, represented by the formula (1):<br><br>
in which n is	between 2 and 10, and<br>
R1and R2, independently of each other are preferably chosen from the group<br>
comprising hydrogen, -CH2CH2OH, -CH2COOH,	<br><br>
alkyls having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and phosphonomethyl.<br>
If R1 is hydrogen and R2 is -CH2-CH2OH, the product resulting from the conversion of the amino alcohol is the salt of iminodiacetic acid.<br>
Typically, the process is carried out by ^ introducing an<br>
aqueous solution of the primary alcohol, an .alkaline<br>
hydroxide and the appropriate quantity of Raney copper<br>
catalyst into a nickel autoclave.	.<br>
The autoclave, which has a controllable discharge valve, is taken to the predetermined temperature, generally; between 100° and 220°C, at which the alcohol is converted to the salt of the corresponding carboxylic acid according to the reaction (2) which, by way of example, refers to the conversion of diethanolamine:<br><br>
After sufficient time to enable the completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is filtered to recover ■ the catalyst which is then recycled in a subsequent reaction.<br>
As is illustrated in the following comparative example	1, in<br>
the absence of special precautions, the activity of the	Raney<br>
copper decreases fairly rapidly and, within six or	seven<br>
recyclings, in substantially the same time, the yield	falls<br>
from 98% to approximately 67%*.<br>
According to the invention, it has been found that by eliminating or  strongly reducing  the  presence  of  the<br><br>
dissolved oxygen in the reagents,  the activity of	the<br>
catalyst decreases surprisingly more slowly,; so that the	same<br>
catalyst can be reused many tens of times with a limited	loss<br>
of activity.<br>
The elimination of the oxygen, or its substantial reduction, can be achieved using physical or chemical means.<br>
The physical elimination is effected by means of stripping, for example, by bubbling an inert gas or water' vapour, preferably helium or nitrogen, through the aqueous solution of the primary alcohol. This operation is preferably carried out immediately before loading the solution in the autoclave which is then preferably, immediately, cleansed with repeated vacuum/nitrogen cycles.<br>
The bubbling time of the inert gas and the insufflation capacity necessary to reduce the level of dissolved oxygen to levels that will prolong the life of the catalyst depend on the efficiency of the bubbling system used, and can be determined by a technical expert in the field by prior testing.<br>
A level of dissolved oxygen less than 0.2-0.3 ppm is particularly preferred.<br>
The chemical removal is effected by means of the addition of appropriate quantities of reducing substances to the aqueous solution of the primary alcohols. The aforesaid reducing substances can be organic or inorganic, although they must be soluble in the reaction mass and such that they do not interfere with the progress of  the reaction.<br>
By way of non-limitative example, reducing substances such as sodium formiate can advantageously be used.<br><br>
The quantity of reducing agent added to the reaction mass is preferably between 0.1 and 0.5% by weight, with reference to the total reaction mass.<br>
The quantity of catalyst used to convert the alcohol can vary<br>
from 1 to 70% by weight with respect to the alcohol, and<br>
preferably from 10 to 40% by weight. These percentages are<br>
calculated with respect to the dry content of Raney cbpper in<br>
its aqueous formulation.	j<br>
The alkaline metallic hydroxides used in the method are those known to the experts in the field. The quantity of hydroxide is at least equal to one equivalent per equivalent of hydroxyl groups present in the alcohol utilised in the reaction. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are preferred because of their availability and economy.<br>
The temperature at which the process is conducted is preferably between 150° and 200°C; the pressure is generally between 5 and 50 kg/cm^ and preferably between 8 and 12 kg/cm^.<br>
The pressure control valve is set depending on the vapour pressure of the water at the predetermined reaction temperature in order to enable the hydrogen that forms during the reaction to be easily discharged.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail in the following examples, given purely by way of non-limitative example.<br>
Example 1 (comparative)     <br>
This example illustrates the performance of the catalyst used<br>
without special precautions for protecting its activity.<br><br>
40 g of diethanolamine (0.38 moles), 85 g of water, 32 g of NaOH in drops (0.80 moles) and 16 g of commercially-available Raney copper containing 50% of water were introduced into a 500 ml nickel autoclave provided with a magnetically driven mechanical stirrer. The autoclave was closed/ cleansed three times with a vacuum/nitrogen, kept under agitation and heated to a temperature of 170°C. The pressure was allowed, to rise and was held at 9 kg/cm2  by adjusting the appropriate discharge valve of the autoclave.<br>
Except for the first two cycles, the reaction was interrupted after a fixed time period of 4.5 hours and the mass analysed to determine the yield of disodium imminodiacetate. The catalyst, separated by filtration from the reaction mass, was reused in a subsequent reaction.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of the tests.<br>
TABLE 1 - Yield using unprotected catalyst<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The example illustrates the use of the catalyst in the case of reduction of the presence of oxygen by physical means (degassing).<br>
125 g of an aqueous solution of diethanalamine containing 40 g of diethanolaraine (0.38 moles) were added to a 500 ml nickel autoclave provided with a magnetically' driven mechanical stirrer. This solution was prepared by weighing the appropriate quantity of the two components ' of the solution into a flat-bottomed conical flask and then bubbling the solution with helium using a diffuser for five minutes. Then, 32 g of NaOH in drops (0.8 moles) and 16 g of commercially-available Raney copper containing 50% of water were added to the autoclave. The autoclave was closed, cleansed rapidly three times using a vacuum/nitrogen, kept under agitation and heated to 170°C.<br>
The pressure was allowed to rise and was held at 9 kg/cm^, by controlling the appropriate discharge valve of the autoclave. When the production of hydrogen stopped, the reaction was stopped and the mass was analysed to determine the yield of disodium imminodiacetate. The catalyst, separated by filtration from the reaction mass, was kept in water degassed using helium awaiting its reutilisation in a subsequent reaction.<br>
Table 2 shows the results of the tests.<br><br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The example illustrates the use of the catalyst in the case of reduction of the presence of oxygen by chemical means, by adding sodium formiate.<br>
The procedure described in example 2 was followed except for the fact that instead of degassing the reagents using helium, 0.3 g of sodium formiate was added to the reaction mass for each cycle.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of the tests.<br>
