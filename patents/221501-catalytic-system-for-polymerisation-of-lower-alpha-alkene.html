PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this.invention-and the, manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
This invention also relates to process for the preparation of the catalytic system and process for the polymerisation of lower alpha alkene using the catalytic  system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Polymers of lower alpha alkene or olefins such as ethylene, propylene or 1-butene find applications in the manufacture of a variety of articles including plastic bags or sheets or automobile parts. Of particular interest in polymer production is polypropylene with a high degree of isotacticity ie the extent of orientation of the methyl groups in the polymer in the same direction, which shows high crystallinity. Polymerisation of lower alpha alkene such as ethylene or propylene involves reacting the monomer with a catalyst under polymerisation conditions. The early polymerisation catalysts were of relatively low activity and the polymers formed contained significant amounts of the catalyst residues, which had to be removed by deashing steps. The more recent alpha alkene polymerisation catalysts are of two types viz single site metallocene and non-metallocene catalysts and heterogeneous solid catalysts. The single site catalysts comprise metallocenes or co-ordination complexes of transition metals and a cocatalyst such as methyl aluminoxane and produces polymer of low polydispersity.<br>
Heterogeneous solid catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts, especially  in the bulk production  of polyethylene     or polypropylene  due  to  their<br>
2<br><br>
high activity and ease of operation. These catalysts are sometimes referred to as Ziegler - Natta catalysts after the name of the inventors (Ziegler et al US Patents Nos 3,903,017; 4,063,009 and 4,125,698 and Natta et al US Patents Nos 3,197,452 and 3,957,743). Several improvements in terms of activity of the catalyst as measured by the amount of polymer produced per unit weight of catalyst and selectivity of the catalyst usually measured for polypropylene by measuring the amount of xylene soluble fraction have since taken place [Chapter 1 (by Brian L Goodall) and Chapter 9 in "Polypropylene and other Polyolefins; Polymerization and Characterization" edited by Ser van der Ven, Elsevier, New York, 1990].<br>
Heterogeneous solid catalysts for polyethylene and polypropylene<br>
comprise a procatalyst and a cocatalyst and optionally an external electron<br>
donor or selectivity control agent (SCA). For polypropylene with high isotacticity<br>
one of the components of the procatalyst is an internal electron donor which<br>
works in tandem with the optional SCA. The procatalysts are synthesized by<br>
chlorination of an organomagnesium compound such as magnesium ethoxide with<br>
a   chlorinating   agent   such as   titanium   tetrachloride	in a     hydrocarbon or<br>
halohydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or chlorobenzene in a multi step reaction so that simultaneous fixing of titanium tetrachloride on magnesium chloride occurs. The internal electron donor is added during the preparation of the polypropylene procatalyst.   The procatalyst    for polypropylene may also be prepared   by milling<br>
3<br><br>
together       anhydrous    magnesium   chloride    with titanium  tetrachloride    and an internal   electron donor.<br>
European Patent No 336, 545 of Bailly et al describes the optional use of aromatic esters such as ethyl benzoate, methyl paratoluate or dibutyl or diisobutyl phthalate as electron donors. US Patent No 4,107,414 of Giannini et al, describes the use of ethyl benzoate, 1,2, dimethoxy benzene or tetrahydrofuryl methyl ether as internal electron donors and esters of oxygenated organic and inorganic acids as external electron donors. Esters of aromatic acids are reported to give best results. US Patent No 4,522,930 of Albizatti et al, describes the use of ethers, ketones, lactones, esters and compounds containing nitrogen phosphorous and/or sulfur atoms as internal electron donors, and compounds with Si-OR, Si-OCOR bonds as SCA. Shamshoum in European Patent No 0605380A2 also reports the use of alkoxy silanes as SCA with commercial Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Use of diether compounds as effective electron donors has been described in European Patent No 728,741 of Morini et al, European Patent No 361,949 of Scordamaglia et al and European Patent No 362,705 of Barbe et al. Use of diethers with alkoxysilne external donors is described by Iskola et al in US Patent No 5,869,418. Use of diethers as internal electron donors eliminating the need of SCA is reported in US Patent No 5,068,213 of Albizzati. US Patent No 5,891,817 of Shamshoum et al describes the use of di-n-alkyl di-methoxy silanes as SCA in combination with diesters of phthalic acid as internal electron donors. US Patent No   6,451,726   of Tagge   describes   the    use of unsaturated     nitrogen<br>
4<br><br>
containing compounds including bipyridyl compounds as internal electron donor or as SCA. US Patent No 6,399,837 of Wilson et al describes the use of 1-ethoxy-2-n-alkoxybenzene compounds as internal electron donor or as SCA or as both.<br>
There is described in our PCT publication No WO 02/44220A1 a lower alpha alkene polymerisation heterogeneous solid catalyst comprising a hydrated magnesium chloride derived procatalyst comprising a titanium tetrahalide supported on a magnesium chloride ester complex precursor. The internal electron donor ester component of the precursor is generated insitu by reaction of a magnesium chloride alcoholate with an activated carbonyl compound in the mole ratio 0.5 - 1 : 10-20. The magnesium chloride alcoholate is formed of hydrated magnesium chloride and an aliphatic alcohol in the mole ratio of 0.5 -1 : 10 -20. The catalyst comprises a cocatalyst comprising an organoaluminium compound, the mole ratio of the aluminium to the titanium being 10 - 300 : 1. The catalyst also comprises a selectivity control agent comprising an ester or ether in the mole ratio 10 - 100 : 1 with respect to the titanium.<br>
There is described in our PCT Publication No WO 03/62283 an olefin polymerisation titanium catalyst comprising a titanium compound and an organoaluminium compound    cocatalyst    supported    on a    soluble    polysulfone<br>
5<br><br>
comprising   free reactive sulfone groups. The   molar ratio of titanium    to aluminium is 1-10 : 200 and the weight ratio  of titanium to polysulfone is 0.01 -0.1 : 0.3-2.5.<br>
There is described in our PCT application No PCT/IN03/00152 a single step process for the preparation of lower alpha alkene polymerisation heterogeneous solid catalyst comprising an organomagnesium precursor derived procatalyst comprising magnesium chloride supported titanium chloride and an internal electron donor and an organoaluminium compound based cocatalyst. The procatalyst is obtained by single step reaction under microwave irradiation of 300 to 1200 W.<br>
Selectivity control Agents reported in the prior art invariably have an aromatic ring and many aromatic compounds are known to be toxic and/or having other  undesirable  properties.<br>
The cocatalyst is organoaluminium compound such as trialkyl aluminium or dialkyl aluminium halide. The alkyl group may be methyl, ethyl, butyl, isobutyl, hexyl and octyl and the halide may be chloride or bromide. The preferred   cocatalyst  is triethyl aluminium..<br>
