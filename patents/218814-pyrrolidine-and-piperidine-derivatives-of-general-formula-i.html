BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an antagonist of the neuropeptide neurokinin-1 (NK-, or NK-1) receptor.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Tachykinins are peptide ligands for neurokinin receptors. Neurokinin receptors, such as NK1, NK2 and NK3, are involved in a variety of biological processes. They can be found in a mammal"s nervous and circulatory systems, as well as in peripheral tissues. Consequently, the modulation of these types of -receptors have been studied to potentially treat or prevent various mammalian disease states. For instance, NIC) receptors have been reported to be involved in microvascular leakage and mucus secretion. Representative types of neurokinin receptor antagonists and their uses can be found in: U.S. 5,760,018 (1998) (pain, inflammation, migraine and emesis), U.S. 5,620,989 (1997) (pain, nociception and inflammation), WO 95/19344 (1995) (same), WO 94/13639 (1994) (same) and WO 94/10165 (1994) (same). Further types of N^ receptor antagonists can be found in Wu et al, Tetrahedron 56, 3043-3051 (2000); Rombouts et al, Tetrahedron Letters 42,7397-7399 (2001); and Rogiers et al, Tetrahedron 57, 8971-8981 (2001).<br>
It would be beneficial to provide a NKi antagonist that is potent, selective, and possesses beneficial therapeutic and pharmacological properties, and good metabolic stability. It would further be beneficial to provide a NK-i antagonist that is effective for treating a variety of physiological disorders, symptoms and diseases while minimizing side effects. The invention seeks to provide these and other benefits, which will become apparent as the description progresses.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following definitions and terms are used herein or are otherwise known to a skilled artisan. Except where stated otherwise, the following definitions apply throughout the specification and claims. These definitions apply regardless of whether a term is used by itself or in combination with other terms, unless otherwise indicated. Hence, the definition of "alkyl" applies to "alkyl" as well as the "alkyl" portions of "hydroxyalkyl," "haloalkyl," "alkoxy," etc.<br>
The term "substituted," as used herein, means the replacement of one or more atoms, usually hydrogen atoms, in a given structure with an atom or radical.<br>
selected from a specified group. In the situations where more than one atom may be replaced with a substituent selected from the same specified group, the substituents may be, unless otherwise specified, either the same or different at every position.<br>
The term "heteroatom," as used herein, means a nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen atom. Multiple heteroatoms in the same group may be the same or different.<br>
The term "alkyl," as used herein, means a straight or branched, hydrocarbon chain having the designated number of carbon atoms. If the number of carbon atoms is not designated, the carbon chain is from one to twenty-four carbon atoms, more preferably, from one to twelve carbon atoms, and most preferably, from one to six carbon atoms.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" as used herein, means a saturated, stable, non-aromatic carbocyclic ring having from three to eight carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl may be attached at any endocyclic carbon atom that results in a stable structure. Preferred carbocyclic rings have from three to six carbons. Examples of cycloalkyl radicals include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.<br>
The term "aryl," as used herein, means an aromatic, mono- or bicyclic, carbocyclic ring system having from one to two aromatic rings. The aryl moiety will<br><br>
generally have from 6 to 14 carbon atoms with all available substitutable carbon atoms of the aryl moiety being intended as possible points of attachment. Representative examples include phenyl, cumenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, indenyl and the like.<br>
The term "heteroaryl," as used herein, means a mono- or bicyclic, chemically feasible ring system containing one or two aromatic rings and 1 to 4 nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms in the aromatic ring. Typically, a heteroaryl group represents a cyclic group of five or six atoms, or a bicyclic group of nine or ten atoms, at least one of which is carbon, and having at least one oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atom interrupting a carbocyclic ring having a sufficient number of pi (n) electrons to provide aromatic character. Representative heteroaryl (heteroaromatic) groups are pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, furanyl, benzofuranyl, thienyl, benzothienyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, isothfazolyl, benzofhiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, oxazolyl, pyrrolyl, isoxazolyl, 1,3,5-triazinyl and indolyl groups. The heteroaryl group can be joined to the rest of the molecule through a bond at any substitutable carbon or nitrogen.<br>
The term "heterocycloalkyl" as used herein means a saturated cyclic ring having from 3 to 8 members, preferably 5 or 6 members, and comprising 2 to 7 carbon atoms and 1 to 3 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of -0-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S02- and -NR35-. Typical heterocycloalkyl rings are pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, and the like. The heterocycloclkyl ring can be attached to the rest of the structure through either a substitutable ring carbon or a substitutable ring nitrogen.<br>
The term "heterocycloalkenyl" as used herein means a cyclic ring having from 3 to 8 members, preferably 5 or 6 members, and comprising 2 to 7 carbon atoms and 1 to 3 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of -0-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S02- and -NR35-, and having at least one double bond in the ring, but not having aromatic characteristics. Examples of such rings are:<br>
  wherein the ring can be attached to the rest of the structure through either a substitutable ring carbon or a substitutable ring nitrogen (e.g., in R4, when G is heterocycloalkenyl, it can be joined to the<br><br>
(CR28R29)n1 group through either a substitutable ring carbon or a substitutable ring nitrogen).<br>
When R4 and R5 form a ring with 1, 2 or 3 groups independently selected from X2, and 1 or 2 of X2 are carbon, the variable size of the ring can be defined by n4 and n7, which are independently selected from 0-5, provided that the sum of n4 and n7 is 1 to 5. A typical structure wherein the heteroatom is -NR35-, X2 is -CH2-, and R30 and R31 together form a carbonyl group is represented by the formula<br><br>
When R4 and R5, together with the carbon to which they are attached, form a heterocycloalkenyl ring, examples of such rings are<br><br>
The term "alkoxy," as used herein, means an oxygen atom bonded to a hydrocarbon chain, such as an alkyl or alkenyl group (e.g., -O-alkyl or -O-alkenyl). Representative alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy, and isopropoxy groups.<br>
The term "hydroxyalkyl," as used herein, means a substituted hydrocarbon chain, preferably, an alkyl group, having at least one hydroxy substituent {i.e., -OH). Representative hydroxyalkyl groups include hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl groups.<br>
The term "halo" or "halogen" as used herein means a chloro, bromo, fluoro or iodo atom radical.<br>
Unless otherwise known, stated or shown to be to the contrary, the point of attachment for a multiple term substituent (multiple terms that are combined to identify a single moiety) to a subject structure is through the last named term of the multiple term. For example, an "arylalkyl" substituent attaches to a targeted structure through the "alkyl" portion of the substituent. Conversely, when the substituent is "alkylaryl", it attaches to a targeted structure through the "aryl" portion of the substituent. Similarly, a cycloalkylalkyl substituent attaches to a targeted through the latter "alkyl" portion of the substituent (e.g., Structure-alkyl-cycloalkyl).<br><br>
When a variable appears more than once in a structural formula, for example,<br>
8<br>
R , its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.<br>
The term "prodrug," as used herein, represents compounds that are drug precursors which, following administration to a patient, release the drug in vivo via a chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to a physiological pH or through an enzyme action is converted to the desired drug form). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of A.C.S. Symposium Series (1987), and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, E.B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press (1987), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
Other than as shown in the operating examples or where is otherwise indicated, all numbers used in the specification and claims expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth, are understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about."<br><br>

Compounds having the formula (I) can be effective antagonists of the NKi receptor, and of an effect of its endogenous agonist, Substance P, at the NIC, receptor site, and therefore, can be useful in treating conditions caused or aggravated by the activity of said receptor. The in vitro and in vivo IMKi, NK2 and NK3 activities of the compounds having the formula (I) can be determined by various procedures known in the art, such as a test for their ability to inhibit the activity of the NKi agonist Substance P. The percent inhibition of neurokinin agonist activity is the difference between the percent of maximum specific binding ("MSB") and 100%. The percent of MSB is defined by the following equation, wherein "dpm" represents "disintegrations per minute":<br>
v M
The concentration at which the compound produces 50% inhibition of binding is then used to determine an inhibition constant ("Ki") using the Chang-Prusoff equation.<br>
In vivo activity may be measured by inhibition of an agonist-induced foot tapping in a gerbil, as descibed in Science, 281, 1640-1695 (1998), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. It will be recognized that compounds having the formula (I) can exhibit N^ antagonist activities of varying degrees. For instance, certain compounds can exhibit stronger NK] antagonist activities than others.<br>
The compounds of the invention exhibit potent affinities for the NK! receptor as measured by Ki values (in nM). The activities (potencies) for the compounds of the invention are determined by measuring their Ki values. The smaller the Ki value, the more active is a compound for antagonizing the NK-i receptor. Compounds of the invention exhibit a wide range of activities. The NKi average Ki values for<br><br>
compounds having the formula (I) generally range from 0.01 nM to about 1000 nM, preferably, from about 0.01 nM to about 500 nM, with values of from about 0.01 nM to about 100 nM being more preferred. Even more preferred are compounds having average Ki values of from 0.01 nM to about 10 nM for the NK-, receptor. The most preferred compounds have N^ average Ki values of from 0.01 nM to about 3 nM. The preferred compounds noted above have the following Ki values: Example 43b: 0.77nM; 72a: 0.66nM; 73b: 0.2nM; 109: 0.1nM; 110a:0.41nM; and 111a: 0.38nM.<br>
The inventive compounds are also highly selective for antagonizing a NKi receptor as opposed to antagonizing (i) NK2 and/or (ii) NK3 receptors. When a compound"s selection ratio is greater than about 100 for the Ki of the N^ receptor to the Ki of the NK2 receptor, and/or, independently, the Ki of the NK3 receptor, then the compound is defined herein as a selective antagonist of the NK-i receptor, as opposed to the NK2 and/or NK3 receptors, respectively.<br>
Compounds having the formula (I) may have at least one asymmetrical carbon atom. All isomers, including stereoisomers, diastereomers, enantiomers, regiostereomers, tautomers and rotational isomers, are contemplated as being part of the invention. Prodrugs, salts, solvates, esters, etc., derived from the compounds having the formula (I) or precursors thereof are also within the scope of the invention. The invention includes d- and /- isomers in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting optically pure or optically enriched starting materials or by separating isomers of a compound having the formula (I). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that for some compounds having the formula (I), particular isomers can show greater pharmacological activity than other isomers.<br>
There are many uses for the compounds having the formula (I). For instance, compounds having the formula (I) can be useful as antagonists of neurokinin receptors, particularly, NKi receptors in a mammal, such as a human. As such, they may be useful in treating and preventing one or more of a variety of mammalian (human and animal) disease states (physiolgical disorders, symptoms and diseases), for instance, respiratory diseases (e.g., chronic lung disease, bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, allergy, cough and bronchospasm), inflammatory diseases (e.g., arthritis and psoriasis), skin disorders (e.g., atopic dermatitis and<br><br>
contact dermatitis), ophthalmalogical disorders (e.g., retinitis, ocular hypertension and cataracts), central nervous system conditions, such as depressions (e.g., neurotic depression), anxieties (e.g., general anxiety, social anxiety and panic anxiety disorders), phobias (e.g., social phobia), and bipolar disorder, addictions (e.g., alcohol dependence and psychoactive substance abuse), epilepsy, nociception, psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer"s disease, AIDs related dementia, Towne"s disease, stress related disorders (e.g., post tramautic stress disorder), obsessive / compulsive disorders, eating disorders (e.g., bulemia, anorexia nervosa and binge eating), mania, premenstrual syndrome, gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, C1ohn"s disease, colitis, and emesis), atherosclerosis, fibrosing disorders (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis), obesity, Type II diabetes, pain related disorders (e.g., headaches, such as migraines, neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, and chronic pain syndromes), bladder and genitourinary disorders (e.g., interstitial cystitis and urinary incontinence), and nausea. In particular, the compounds having the formula (I) are useful for treating disease states related to microvascular leakage and mucus secretion. Consequently, the compounds of the invention are especially useful in the treatment and prevention of asthma, emesis, nausea, depressions, anxieties, cough and pain related disorders.<br>
In still another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for antagonizing an effect of a Substance P at a neurokinin-1 receptor site or for the blockade of one or more neurokinin-1 receptors in a mammal in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of at least one compound having the formula (I).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an effective amount of one or more of the inventive NKi receptor antagonists may be combined with an effective amount of one or more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ("SSRIs") to treat depression or anxiety. SSRIs alter the synaptic availability of serotonin through their inhibition of presynaptic reaccumulation of neuronally released serotonin. U.S. 6,162,805, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses a method for treating obesity with a combination therapy of a NICi receptor antagonist and an SSRI. An inventive compound(s) having the formula (I) can be combined together with an SSRI(s) in a single pharmaceutical composition or it can be administered simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with an SSRI.<br><br>
Numerous chemical substances are known to alter the synaptic availability of serotonin through their inhibition of presynaptic reaccumulation of neuronally released serotonin. Representative SSRIs include, without limitation, the following: fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertaline, and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. Other compounds can readily be evaluated to determine their ability to selectively inhibit serotonin reuptake. Thus, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one NK-i receptor antagonist having the formula (I) and at least one SSRI, and a method of treating the above identified mammalian disease states, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one N^ receptor antagonist having the formula (I) in combination with at least one SSRI, such as one of those recited above.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating emesis, .comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of at least one NKi receptor antagonist having the formula (I). Compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in treating delayed onset emesis such as that experienced 24 hours to several days after the administration of chemotherapy. See Gonzales et al, Oncology Special Edition, Vol. 5 (2002), p. 53-58. Combinations of at least one NIC, receptor antagonist and at least one other anti¬emetic agent such as a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, a corticosteroid or a substituted benzamide can be used to treat other forms of emesis, e.g., acute emesis induced by chemotherapy, radiation, motion and alcohol (e.g., ethanol), and post-operative nausea and vomiting. Examples of serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are palonsetron, dolasetron, ondansetron and granisetron, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. An examples of a suitable corticosteroid is dexamethasone. An example of a substituted benzamide is metoclopramide.<br>
Preferred combinations for the treatment of emesis include a compound of formula I and a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; a compound of formula I and a corticosteroid; a compound of formula I and a substituted benzamide; a compound of formula I, a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and a corticosteroid; and a compound of formula I, a substituted benzamide and a corticosteroid.<br>
When an inventive N^ receptor antagonist is combined with an SSRI, a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, a corticosteroid or a substituted benzamide for<br><br>
administration to a patient in need of such treatment, the two or more active ingredients can be administered simultaneously, consecutively (one after the other within a relatively short period of time), or sequentially (first one and then the other over a period of time).<br>
Thus, the compounds of the invention may be employed alone or in combination with other agents. In addition to the above described NKi receptor antagonist / SSRI or serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist combination therapy, the compounds having the formula (I) may be combined with other active agents, such as other types of NKi receptor antagonists, prostanoids, H, receptor antagonists, a-adrenergic receptor agonists, dopamine receptor agonists, melanocortin receptor agonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, neutral metalloendopeptidase inhibitors, ETA antagonists, renin inhibitors, serotonin 5-HT2c receptor agonists, nociceptirr receptor agonists, rho kinase inhibitors, potassium channel modulators and/or inhibitors of multidrug resistance protein 5. Preferable therapeutic agents for combination therapy with compounds of the invention are the following: prostanoids, such as prostaglandin Ei; a-adrenergic agonists, such as phentolamine mesylate; dopamine receptor agonists, such as apomorphine; angiotensin II antagonists, such as losartan, irbesartan, valsartan and candesartan; and ETA antagonists, such as bosentan and ABT-627. Dosage ranges for the other agent can be determined from the literature.<br>

Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of C1eams, lotions, aerosols and/or ;:. - emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type       -as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparations subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>

The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill in the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age,<br><br>
condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 0.02 mg/day to about 2000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses.<br>
The quantity of NfCt receptor antagonist in combination with a SSRI or serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (5-HT3) in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 10 to about 300 mg of NK-i receptor antagonist combined with from about 10 to about 100 mg of SSRI or 5-HT3.

An even further quantity of NKi receptor antagonist in combination with SSRI or 5-HT3in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 50 to about 300 mg of NK-i receptor antagonist combined with from about 20 to about 50 mg of SSRI or 5-HT3, depending on the particular application. Dosage levels for the corticosteroids and substituted benzamides can be determined form the literature.<br>
Alternatively, separate dosage forms of the compounds of formula I and the other agents can be provided in a single package as a kit for the convenience of the patient. This is particularly useful when the separate components must be administered in different dosage forms (e.g., a tablet and a capsule) or at different dosage schedules.<br>
Upon improvement of a patient"s condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of the invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained. When the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.<br>
The inventive compounds can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically-acceptable solvents, such as water, ethanol, and the like, are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for purposes of this invention.<br>

hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base forms with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in a conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution, such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia or sodium bicarbonate.

Compounds having the formula (F) can be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Typical procedures are described below, although a skilled artisan will recognize that other procedures may be applicable, and that the procedure may be suitably modified to prepare other compounds within the scope of formula (I).<br>
General Methods of Preparation<br>
Compounds having the formula (I) may be generally prepared from the corresponding protected oxazolidinone derivative A1 as shown under the following conditions, where Ar1 and Ar2 are each defined as in the summary of the invention; X1 is -0-; R1 through R33, independently of one another, are each defined as in the summary of the invention; and n2 is 1.<br>
The stereoselective alkylation of a protected oxazolidinone A1 provides the protected oxazolidinone A2. Partial reduction with a reducing agent, such as LAH, provides the lactol A3. A Wittig reaction provides the corresponding olefin A4. Hydrogenation of the olefin A4 and cyclization provides the lactam A5. If the protecting group (Pr) on the nitrogen is Cbz then it might cleave under hydrogenation conditions. The deprotection of the nitrogen of the lactam A5, if necessary, followed by reduction of the lactam with reducing agents such as LAH or LAH/AICI3, preferably LAH/AICI3, provides substituted pyrrolidines A6.<br><br>
Compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 1 and R4 is -NR13R14, -NR12S02R13, -NR12C(0)R14, or-NR12(C(0)NR13R14) can also be prepared by conversion of lactol A3 to olefin A7 via Wittig reaction using a nitrogen protected (NPr") glycine ester Wittig reagent where Pr" can be a Boc or Cbz protecting group and Pr is preferably a Cbz protecting group. Palladium catalyzed hydrogenation.and deprotection (if Pr is a Cbz group) of olefin A7, followed by spontaneous cyclization will provide lactam A8. When Pr is not Cbz or a protecting group readily cleaved under standard hydrogenation conditions, then hydrogenation of the olefin A7 is followed by deprotection of-NHPr and subsequent cyclization to provide lactam A8. The deprotection of the N-Pr" group, if necessary, followed by the reduction of the lactam with reducing agents as LAH or LAH/AICI3, preferably l_AH/AICI3, provides amino-pyrrolidines A9 which can further be functionalized using standard conditions to give N-substituted pyrrolidines A10.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the stereoselective hydrogenation of the double bond of olefin A7 are can also be performed using a chiral hydrogenation catalyst such as chiral Rhodium catalyst which can provide chiral<br><br>
ester A11. Deprotection of the protecting group (if Pr, Pr" are Cbz groups) under standard hydrogenation conditions followed by spontaneous cyclization will provide chiral amino-lactam A12. The reduction of the chiral amino-lactam A12 with reducing agents as LAH or LAH/AICI3, preferably, LAH/AICI3, provides chiral amino-pyrrolidines A13 which can further be functionalized using standard conditions to give N-substituted pyrrolidines A14.<br><br>
Compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 2, 3 or 4, may be prepared by conversion of the lactol A3 to carbon homologated derivatives A15 (n is 1, 2 or 3) using routine chemistry known to those skilled in the art. Particularly useful reagents for this carbon chain homologation include: Wittig chemistry using methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium bromide or an analogous reagent, cyanomethyl triphenylphosphonium bromide and Homer-Emmons protocols, and aldol chemistry. Hydrogenation and cyclization to the 6-, 7- and 8-membered lactams A17, respectively, and deprotection and reduction to the 6-, 7- and 8-membered substituted reduced lactams A18, are analogous to the previously described procedures.<br><br><br>
Another method for preparing aldehyde A15 where R6, R7 = H involves Wittig homologation of lactol A3 to ethylene derivative A19 which upon hydroboration, preferably with 9-BBN, and subsequent oxidation provides aldehyde A20.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 2, and X1 is -O-can be prepared by means of transformation of ketone A21 to the sulfinamide using the appropriate sulfinamide (racemic or chiral) and titaniumisopropoxide, according to the protocol described in Cogan et al, Tetrahedron, 55, 8883 (1999). The sulfinamide A22 is then treated with a suitable allyl grignard reagent, followed by ozonolysis to provide the aldehyde A24. Those skilled in the art will recognize that addition of allyl grignard will provide A23 where R6, R7 = H which can be further modified at the allylic position to incorporate functionalities from the definition of R6 and R7 using routine chemistry such as alkylation and hydroxylation. Wittig chemistry on aldehyde A24, followed by hydrogenation, deprotection and cyclization provides the lactam A26. Standard reduction of the lactam A26 provides the substituted piperidines A27, where n2 is 2.<br><br>
When X1 is as defined in the summary of the invention, the ketone A21 wherein X1 is an ether, thio or imino group may be prepared using several different<br><br>
methods employing commercially available materials. Ketone A28 can be subjected to acylation (Q1 is -NH2, -OH or -SH), reductive amination (Q1 is -NH2), ether formation (Q1 is -OH) by standard alkylation methods, thio ether formation (Q1 is -SH) by standard alkylation methods, or esterification (Q1 is -OH or -SH). Alternatively, the corresponding alcohol A29 can be oxidized to an aldehyde and treated with an aryl or heteroaryl organometallic reagent, followed by oxidation<br><br>
Another method for preparing ketone A21 involves nucleophilic displacement of a leaving group, such as -CI, -Br, -I, -OMs and -OTf, adjacent to the aryl or heteroaryl ketone, for example, see WO 01/44200 (2001), which is incorporated     - -herein in its entirety by reference. Accordingly, a suitable substituted styrene or heteroaryl epoxide may be opened with the appropriate nucleophile to give the<br><br><br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the stereoselective hydrogenation of the double bond of olefin A32 can also be performed using a chiral hydrogenation catalyst such as chiral Rhodium catalyst which can provide chiral ester A36. The chiral ester A36 can be converted to chiral functionalized amino-piperidine compounds A39 using the chemistry as described earlier for the chiral functionalized<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that homologation of the aldehyde A15 followed by subsequent synthetic operations as described above will result in the cyclic reduced lactams, where n2 is 3 or 4.<br>
Another method of preparing compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 2, and X1 is -0-, involves the alkyation of amine derivative A40 with a suitable substituted allylic halide, preferably a 2-substituted allylic bromide, to bis olefin A41. Treatment of the bis olefin A41 with Grubb"s or Schrock"s catalyst using standard olefin metathesis conditions provides the unsaturated piperidine derivative A42. Deprotection of the nitrogen and hydrogenation provides the six-membered cyclic reduced lactams or substituted piperidines A43. If the protecting group (Pr) on the nitrogen is Cbz, then it might cleave under hydrogenation conditions. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that alkylation of amine A40 with an appropriate substituted alkyl halide of 4 to 5 carbon atoms in length containing a terminal olefin, followed by subsequent synthetic operations as described above will result in the substituted cyclic reduced lactams, where n2 is 3 or 4.<br><br><br>
When R4 = COOCH3l the chemistry as described above provides A46 where ester group could be further transformed to other functional groups such as amide (R4 = CONR13R14) and alcohol (R4 = CH2OH) using standard chemistry. In addition, the piperidine A46 can be further functionalized using chemistry such as alkylation followed by deprotection of the nitrogen, if necessary, to provide substituted<br><br>
Another method of preparing compounds having the formula (I), where n2 is 1, X1 is -O- and R4 is -OH, -0-(CrC6 alkyl), -0-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl), -0-(CrC6 alkyl)-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl), -OC(0)R14, or -OCONR13R14, from lactol A3 involves Wittig chemistry to provide the corresponding olefin ester A48. Hydrogenation of the olefin ester A48, followed by reduction to the alcohol using metal hydride reducing agents, preferably LiBH4, and subsequent oxidation, such as Swern or bleach, gives aldehyde A50. The cyclization of aldehyde A50 provides enamide A51 which upon hydroxylation, preferably using a borane gives alcohol A52. The alcohol A52 can be oxidized under standard oxidation conditions such as Swern oxidation to give ketone A53. Treatment of the ketone with a suitable organometallic reagent provides the tertiary alcohol A54. For instances where the desired R5 substituent cannot be<br><br>
incorporated directly with an organometallic reagent, further functionalization at the R5 position may be necessary. The hydroxyl group of alcohol A54 can be further functionalized using standard chemistry followed by deprotection to give disubstituted pyrrolidines A55.

-0-(CrC6 alkyl), -0-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl),), -0-(CrC6 alkyl)-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl), -OC(0)R14or -OCONR13Ru, can be prepared from lactol A3. Wittig chemistry followed by hydrogenation and cyclization in weakly acidic conditions such as p-toluenesulfonic acid provides the enamide A59. Using the synthetic operations as described above from the enamide A51, the enamide A59 will result in the disubstituted piperidines A63 and monosubstituted piperidines A64.<br><br><br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that homologation of the lactol A3 to the aldehyde A15 where n2 is 2 or 3 followed by subsequent synthetic operations as described above will result in the monosubstituted cyclic amines A64 or disubstituted cyclic amines A63 where n2 is 2 or 3.<br>
The compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 1, 2, 3 or 4, X1 is -O- and, R4 and R5, together with the carbon to which they are both attached, form a chemically feasible 5 membered ring can be prepared from corresponding ketones. The ketone A65 is transformed into the corresponding hydantoin A66 by heating with KCN/ammonium carbonate in ethanol/water mixture or by using alternate standard conditions known to those skilled in the art. The amine is deprotected to give hydanotin A67 which can be converted to corresponding urea analogs A68 by reduction preferably with LAH/AICI3. Alternatively hydanotin A66 can be cleaved to amino-acid A69 using the protocol described in Kubik, S.; Meissner, R.S.; Rebek, J. Tetrahedron Lett. 35, 6635 (1994). Standard protection of the amino-acid A69 as a carbamate derivative (Pr") is followed by activation of the carboxylic acid. Treatment with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent, preferably triphosgene, is one such method for acid activation. The reduction of NBoc-UNCA A71 with reducing agents, preferably lithium borohydride, gives alcohol A72 which can be converted to five<br><br>
membered cyclic compounds such as carbamate A73 by intramolecular cyclization (if Pr" is carbamate protecting group such as Boc) using base, preferably NaH, followed by deprotection. Alternatively, alcohol A72 can be oxidized to NBoc-aldehyde A74 by standard oxidation conditions such as Swern oxidation and using the routine chemistry known to those skilled in the art. The NBoc-aldehyde A74 can be converted to cyclic analogs such as the y-lactam A75.<br><br>

Alternatively, the NBoc-amino-acid A70 can be reacted with an amine, followed by deprotection of N-Pr" group to give amino-amide A76. The amino-amide A76 can also be deprotected to give analogs A78 where R4 is -NR13R14 and R13, R14 = H.<br><br><br>

Another method of preparing the compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 1, 2, 3, or 4, X1 is -0-, R5 is H, and R4 is a heterocyclic or heteroaryl group involves conversion of the ketone A65 to a vinyl triflate A89 by using a base such as LDA and triflic anhydride as an electrophile. The triflate A89 could be coupled with suitable organometalic reagents, preferably boronic acid, to give heterocyclic or heteroaryl unsaturated compound A90.

The compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 1, 2, 3, or 4, X1 is -O- and R4 is -C(OR12)(R13)(R14), where R14 is H, or-C(=NOR14)(R13) can be prepared by conversion of aldehyde A82 to an alcohol A92 via addition of an organometallic reagent. The alcohol A92 can be transformed to analogs such as A93 or it can be oxidized to ketone A94 which can provided analogs such as oxime A95 using the<br><br>
The compounds having the formula I, where n2 is 1, 2, 3 or 4, X1 is -0-, R5 is H, and R4 is -C(R28R29)CONR13R14, where R28, R29 = H or methyl, can be prepared by conversion of ketone A65 to unsaturated ester A96 using Wittig chemistry. Hydrogenation of the double bond and deprotection of the protecting group, if necessary, provides the ester A97. Conversion of the ester to amides A98 can be realized through treatment with amines, or transformation to the acid and subsequent coupling with amines using standard methods. In addition, the unsaturated ester A96 can also provide compounds where R4and R5, together with the carbon to which they are attached, form a five membered cyclic ring such as lactam A100.<br><br><br>

with a suitable base and reaction of the necessary electrophile to provide the substitutents defined for R35. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a substituted alkyl halide will afford the corresponding substituted C1C6 alkyl group and treatment with tetrabenzylpyrophosphate, followed by hydrogenation will serve to provide for R35 = -P(0)(OH)2.<br>
Functionalization of the reduced lactam nitrogen can be performed at an appropriate point in the synthesis by deprotonation with a suitable base and reaction of the necessary electrophile to provide the substitutents defined for R18. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a substituted alkyl halide will afford the corresponding substituted C1C6 alkyl group and treatment with tetrabenzylpyrophosphate, followed by hydrogenation will serve to provide for R18 = -P(0)(OH)2. <br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that certain additional protection and deprotection steps may be needed in order to accommodate different functional groups. Accordingly, the order of synthetic operations may be different in order to maintain functional group compatibility with the operational steps in the synthesis.<br><br>
