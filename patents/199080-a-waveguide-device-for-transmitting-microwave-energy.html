				<td>The present invention relates to a waveguide device for transmitting microwave energy  The waveguide device serves as a pathway for transmitting microwave energy from.a microwave source through an explosion proof/flame proof process seal interface to an ant Erma. This device is particularly useful in instruments that determine product levels in tanks.<br>
Radar level gauges are in wide use for measuring the level of products in tanks. Process fluids contained in tanks range from benign products to severely corrosive or abrasive compounds. The operating restriction that is present is that the product contained in the tank must have a dielectric constant high enough to cause microwave signal reflection which can be received by the gauge. Antenna and waveguide assemblies that are used also have to be capable of containing the process pressures in the tanks in order to isolate the gauge electronics from the process vapors and fluids.<br>
It is important that the level gauge waveguide contain process pressures<br>
both in terms of preventing damage to the gauge electronics and in terms of<br>
preserving the tank's ability to contain process pressures. An additional design<br>
constraint for microwave level gauges used in process applications that are<br>
considered to be hazardous locations are explosion proof/flame proof<br>
certification requirements. These requirements come from standards developed<br>
by various representatives of industry, government, and certifying agencies.<br>
The need for containing an internal explosion	<br><br>
of a specific flammable vapor-air mixture and not allowing the propagation of ignition temperature gasses to the external environment is set forth in the standards. At the present time, meeting the design requirements of these explosion proof/flame proof standards has required very precise manufacturing processes and the addition of high precision components. This results in greater labor and material costs to be placed on an instrument already significantly constrained by microwave performance criteria that must be met for proper gauge operation. More specifically, the waveguide or pathway from the electronics or microwave source must include an explosion proof/flame proof seal as well as serve as a microwave signal pathway.<br>
One existing solution to the problem includes separating the gauge into two assemblies: one being the antenna/microwave sensor assembly and the other the electronics assembly. During installation of this gauge, the antenna/microwave sensor assembly is assembled to the tank with a separate process seal. The electronics assembly contains the circuitry for power regulation, signal processing, communications, and the level and volume calculations and corrections. The antenna/microwave sensor assembly is a very low power device that transmits and receives microwave signals. The spacing between the components used in the antenna/microwave sensor assembly electronics and the low power level permit the assembly to meet the requisites for intrinsically safe instrumentation. However, even with the separated level gauge components there is still a need for the process seal between the sensor and the potentially aggressive products inside the tank.<br><br>
Another method of avoiding the explosion proof/flame proof requirements at the interface of the source of the microwave signal and the antenna, is to encapsulate the antenna inside an agency approved epoxy, RTV or glass. In order for this to be feasible the antenna must be small or the additional epoxy required and extensive housing modifications would make the gauge design quite expensive. When the antenna is encapsulated inside epoxy, the customer has two mounting options, namely the microwave level gauge can be mounted directly on the tank or the gauge can be mounted on a "window" covering an opening or port in the tank. Both the window and the gauge must be designed to meet material, safety certification, microwave performance, and process seal requirements.<br>
However, the need still exists for a low cost, effective, and high performance process sealed waveguide assembly that fulfills the microwave signal transmission requirements, acts as a process seal, and meets the explosion proof/flame proof certification requirements.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a microwave signal transmission device for transmitting microwave energy from a source through an opening or port in a tank or other vessel, and is comprised of a process sealed waveguide acting as a microwave transmission line at the working frequency and power output of the gauge and which serves as a mechanical barrier for preventing pressure leakage.<br>
The process sealed waveguide is characterized by part geometry which provides impedance matching with the antenna to avoid reflections, resonance, and similar microwave signal problems. Impedance matching reduces inefficiencies, losses and false target returns.<br><br>
Microwave electronics are now capable of operating at 24 GHz, which is more than twice as high as the operative frequency of presently existing gauges. High frequency microwave signals permit reducing the cross sectional area of the waveguide, whether it is circular or rectangular, without losing microwave signal propagation. This reduction in size allows for the creation of a physically small, microwave transparent mechanical barrier that can be secured in the waveguide. The cross sectional area of this barrier is sufficiently small enough that for a given material the ability of the waveguide to withstand process pressure loads is significantly increased. The primary process sealed waveguide is formed by securing a barrier in a correctly sized waveguide aperture placed in a flange that covers a port or opening of a vessel or tank. A waveguide that is circular in cross section is preferred and is easier to manufacture with regard to tolerance control of size, particularly in the securing hub or joint area of the barrier.<br>
The mechanical joint supporting the barrier in the waveguide is made sufficiently strong to withstand the process pressures without failure so that the process pressure is maintained in the tank or vessel and is sealed from the electronic microwave source. The barrier also has to withstand the operating temperature requirements as well as being resistant to any corrosive process fluids they might contact. The barrier preferably has a tapered end, formed conically, as shown, to aid in impedance matching. The tapered end can be truncated rather than sharp, or the barrier can be a full cylinder, except reflection is a problem with flat surfaces.<br><br>
Certification of the microwave gauge and process sealed waveguide is achieved by careful control of flamepaths and pressure retaining joints to meet certification standards. In addition, the process sealed waveguide will be subjected to hydrostatic pressure testing as a routine manufacturing step. In the embodiment shown, there is an adapter plate or housing to flange transition between the microwave source and the flange, which has a waveguide aperture for receiving a second barrier forming a secondary process seal that in this case is identical to the primary seal, but inverted so that the tapered portion of the barrier is facing the other direction in the waveguide.<br>
In order to meet the most stringent of the certification requirements on the microwave gauge, the embodiment shown also includes a non-flame propagating pressure relief joint or vent path area between the mechanical barriers. This vent path is carefully tested by certification agencies to insure that in the event of a primary mechanical barrier failure in the waveguide, pressure is relieved before it reaches the secondary barrier without flame propagation in either direction; out of the gauge or into the tank.<br>
The length of the taper or transition section of the mechanical barrier indicated is on the order of one waveguide wavelength in length, while more conservative design estimates indicate the taper length should be as long as two waveguide wavelengths if possible.<br>
Materials useful for construction of the mechanical barrier include tetrafluoroethylene, low dielectric constant and low dissipation factor thermoplastics, quartz, glass and ceramic materials.<br><br>
Good mechanical strength, low dielectric constant, low loss tangent or dissipation factor, chemical stability, and good corrosion resistance are desired material properties. One preferred material is ceramic, of which several types exhibit the properties listed above. In particular, aluminum oxide, the purer the better, is satisfactory and a mechanical barrier made of this material can be brazed in place to form a very good process sealed waveguide. 99.5% pure through pure (synthetic sapphire) alumina oxide has been used.<br>
The present invention provides a redundant barrier design, and creates a pressure relief joint or venting region between the primary and secondary barriers in the process sealed waveguide, to satisfy the most difficult of the certification requirements. An explosion proof/flame proof process sealed waveguide is thus provided.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a waveguide device for transmitting microwave energy from a microwave source supported on a support member to an anteima through the waveguide device, comprising a waveguide aperture in the support coupled to the microwave source and antenna; and a low dielectric constant waveguide barrier in said waveguide aperture comprising a hub sealed to surface portions defining the aperture and supported in said aperture comprising a solid material waveguide barrier elongated in direction from said hub portion in direction towards the antenna.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a process tank indicated generally at 10 is filled with a liquid 12, the height or level of which is to be determined utilizing a microwave level sensor assembly 14. The level sensor assembly 14 is mounted on a tank port 16 at the top of the tank, and is sealed relative thereto. The microwave level sensor transmits microwave energy through the port, along a waveguide and will receive reflected energy from the liquid surface 13 to provide an indication of- the level of this liquid within the tank. The electronics that are used for transmitting the microwave energy, and receiving the reflections are well known, and are shown only schematically.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the microwave level sensor assembly 14 is illustrated.<br>
It is mounted onto a standoff pipe 20 fastened to the top of the tank 10 (see Figure 1) around port 16. Fastened to standoff pipe 20 is the tank flange 22.<br>
A level sensor assembly mounting flange or support 24 is secured with bolts to tank flange 22 and is sealed with a suitable gasket. The mounting flange 24 is used for supporting both the housing to flange adapter 40 and the electronics housing 26 which includes microwave source circuitry of conventional design shown at 34. The microwave source circuitry 34 provides microwave energy through a coaxial connection indicated generally at 28 that is coupled to a coaxial to rectangular waveguide adapter 30 within the electronics housing 26. The coaxial to rectangular waveguide adapter 30 is secured with screws to a raised boss 36 of the housing flange adapter 40 via the coaxial to rectangular waveguide adapter mounting bracket 32.<br><br>
A waveguide aperture 3 8 is formed in adapter plate 40 and is aligned with adapter 30. Waveguide aperture 3 8 is in the form of an upwardly expanding circular to rectangularly shaped hole. Adapter plate 40 is secured to the mounting flange 24, with bolts of selected size and torqued to a level selected to permit some elastic yielding if pressure between the secondary barrier 62 and primary barrier 54 exceeds a predetermined level. Waveguide aperture 46 in the center of mounting flange 24 aligns with waveguide aperture 38, so that microwave energy transmitted through the waveguide adapter 30 is transmitted through the aligned waveguide apertures. Waveguide aperture 46 is in the form of a downwardly expanding circular cone.<br>
A suitable antenna 48 is mounted on the bottom side of the flange 24, and is positioned within the port 16. The antenna 48 is of conventional design and includes a central aperture 50 at an upper end that aligns with waveguide aperture 46 in the flange 24, and thus aligns with the waveguide aperture 38 in the adapter plate 40.<br>
In order to provide a barrier for vapors or liquids that are in the interior of the tank 10 (see Figure 1) and to prevent the vapors from being discharged to the exterior, a low dielectric mechanical barrier 54 is suitably secured in the waveguide aperture 46 and forms a primary mechanical, pressure tight barrier. The low dielectric mechanical barrier 54, as shown in Figure 2, is an elongated barrier member having a generally cylindrical base or hub end shown at 58, and a conically tapered or pointed transition and impedance matching section 60 (see Figure 2) . When made of tetrafluoroethylene, the base end 5 8 of the low dielectric mechanical barrier 54 can be formed with an<br><br>
irregular surface to aid in providing a solid mechanical joint between the surface of the upper end of waveguide aperture 46 and the base end 58 of the barrier when the barrier is epoxied in place in the waveguide aperture 46 of mounting flange 24. When the low dielectric mechanical barrier 54 is made of aluminum oxide, then the base end 58 does not require the irregular shape and it can be brazed in the waveguide aperture 46 of mounting flange 24.<br>
The portion of the aperture 46 holding the hub end 58 of the barrier 54 may be slightly tapered in upward direction. This will result in pressure from the tank tending to urge the hub to seat more tightly in the aperture.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the tapered or pointed end section 60 of the low dielectric mechanical barrier 54 forms a transition section for impedance matching with the air or vapor filled antenna 48. The length of the low dielectric mechanical barrier tapered section 60 is measured from the base end 58 to the outer tip of the tapered end section 60 and should conservatively be in the range of two waveguide wavelengths long, the lengths on the order of one waveguide wavelength have been used successfully. If the low dielectric mechanical barrier 54 is made of tetrafluoroethylene, an epoxy or other bonding material will be used in the hub or joint area between the base end 58 of the low dielectric mechanical barrier and the surface of waveguide aperture 4 6 to hold the mechanical barrier 54 sealed in position and therefore blocking the transmission of gasses or liquids through the waveguide aperture 46. Brazing an aluminum oxide mechanical barrier into the waveguide aperture 4 6 also provides a secure mechanical barrier as needed.<br><br>
The low dielectric mechanical barrier 54 forms a primary mechanical barrier against transmission of vapors, fluids, or materials under pressure from tank 10 (see Figure 1).<br>
A second low dielectric mechanical barrier 62 forms a secondary mechanical barrier and is positioned in waveguide aperture 38 of the housing to flange adapter plate 40. It is made identical to low dielectric mechanical barrier 54, but the whole barrier is inverted so that the tapered end section 64 is flipped relative to the low dielectric mechanical barrier 54. The second low dielectric mechanical barrier 62 has a base end 61 and a tapered or pointed end 64 similar to that shown at 60, but is directed upwardly into waveguide aperture 38. The tapered end is close to the coaxial to rectangular waveguide transition 30 in the electronics housing 26 which houses the microwave energy source 34. This tapered or pointed end section 64 forms a transition section to aid in impedance matching with the air-filled coaxial to rectangular waveguide adapter 30. The base end of low dielectric mechanical barrier 62 and the base end of low dielectric barrier 54 concentrically abut for waveguide continuity, but they are not fastened together.<br>
The tapered end sections of the barriers may be truncated to have flat ends, or can be cylindrical for the full length of the barrier, if reflections that occur with flat surfaces are not problem.<br>
The low dielectric mechanical barriers 54 and 62 forming primary and secondary process sealed waveguide mechanical barriers are made of a low dielectric material, such as tetrafluoroethylene, or a low dielectric constant and low dissipation factor thermoplastic, quartz, glass and ceramic materials. The<br><br>
diameter of the mechanical barriers and the waveguides apertures is primarily determined by both the wavelength of the microwave signal being transmitted and the dielectric constant of the barrier materials. "<br>
As an example of the general microwave formulas that apply to waveguides and antennas, the following formulas indicate how beam width is a function of the frequency of the signal, and the antenna diameter (using metric units):<br>
X = c/f Beam Width = 7 0 * \/<i></i>
=   70 * (c/f) /0 Where X = wavelength of the microwave signal,  f = frequency of the microwave signal, c = speed of light (3 * 10® m/s), and 0 = the diameter of the antenna.<br>
Another important equation is the relationship<br>
between the radius of the waveguide (a) , the longest<br>
wavelength  (X^)  that  can  be  transmitted  by  the<br>
dielectric filled waveguide, and the dielectric constant<br>
(e) of the barrier material:<br>
X,, = Ve * (2 * TT * a) /1.841<br>
(using metric units)<br>
The interface formed by the mating surfaces of the housing to flange adapter 40 and the mounting flange 24 as shown in Figures 2 and 4 forms a long vent path from the central waveguide apertures by appropriately designing the outer diameter of the housing flange adapter 40 to create the long vent pathway. The mating surfaces between the housing to flange adapter 40 and the mounting flange 24 form a sufficiently long pathway from the process sealed waveguide aperture 46 to the atmosphere for venting gasses or vapors without allowing flame propagation in either direction. The secondary process sealed waveguide barrier 62 prevents flame<br><br>
propagation into the waveguide aperture 3 8 and therefore into electronics housing 26. The design of housing to flange adapter 40 can be adjusted to meet explosion proof/flame proof certification requirements.<br>
It should be noted that flame propagation is prevented in two paths, past the secondary process sealed waveguide barrier 62 and between the facing surfaces of the housing to flange adapter 40 and mounting flange 24. The flames are also prevented from propagating from the exterior, such as from the electronics housing 26 into the antenna opening or from the exterior of the mounting flange 24, inwardly.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 4 the mounting flange 24 and housing to flange adapter 40 are configured with an 0-ring interface that is designated to as pressure ingress protection, but permits hot or pressurized gasses to escape through the vent pathway that occurs at the interface between the mating surfaces of the housing to flange adapter 40 and the mounting flange 24.<br>
The mounting flange 24 has an annular recess 70 that defines a concentric ring 71 in its center. The housing to flange adapter 40 has a raised concentric ring 74 that fits within the annular recess 70 of the mounting flange and includes a concentric 0-ring groove 76 in which an 0-ring 78 is placed, and the 0-ring 78 compressed onto the upper surface 71A of the mounting flange concentric ring 71.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the 0-ring groove 76 has a pair of lobes 76A and 76B, which create widened areas in the 0-ring groove 76. In the event of a failure of the primary process seal 54, pressure will cause the 0-ring 78 to expand into the lobes 76A or 76B at predetermined low pressures.  When that happens the 0-<br><br>
ring 78 travels sufficiently far to clear the edge of the flange concentric ring 71 and no longer seals to surface 71A. This movement releases or vents the pressure to the mating surfaces of the housing to flange adapter 40 and mounting flange 24. The process vapors, hot gasses, or pressurized liquids can safely escape through the relatively long distance between the central process sealed waveguide apertures and the outer edge of the housing to flange adapter 40. This path is represented in Figure 2 by a dark line 80.<br>
Bolts or capscrews 82 which are used for fastening the housing to flange adapter 40 in position are kept at a known predetermined low torqxie so that the plate will elastically stretch the bolts 82 and permit the venting separation to occur. The separation is controlled to be only a thin space to quench flames before the flames reach the atmosphere.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, if the process sealed waveguide barriers 54 and 62 are epoxied into the waveguide apertures 46 and 38, the length of the epoxy joint at the base ends 58 and 61 must be greater than ten millimeters to meet certification requirements, and irregularities should be formed on the hubs 58 and 61. The epoxy selected must meet mechanical and operating temperature requirements for the gauge as well as matching the electrical and microwave parameter for the waveguide. At the certification agencies the epoxy must pass flammability, aging and chemical compatibility testing. When quartz and ceramic materials are used for the primary and secondary mechanical barriers, the joints between the barriers and waveguide apertures can be a combination press fit and shrink fit, and then brazed, or simply only a brazed joint. Placement of the<br><br>
braze is carefully controlled to protect the integrity of the impedance matching.<br>
The fitting and assembly of the ceramic mechanical barriers can be done by heating the mounting flange 24 (or housing to flange adapter plate 40) and inserting the ceramic mechanical barrier into the corresponding waveguide aperture which has been expanded by the application of heat. An initial interference fit is provided during insertion of the barriers into apertures of the heated mounting flange 24 or housing to flange adapter 40, and when the flange or plate cools, it shrinks even more tightly onto the ceramic mechanical barrier, which has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion. Brazing at the base end of the ceramic mechanical barrier then finishes the assembly process.<br>
In selecting the material for the low dielectric mechanical barrier, the lower the dielectric constant is preferred as long as consideration is also given to the material strength properties. Assuming a 24 GHz signal, a lower dielectric, low dissipation factor material permits construction of a larger diameter waveguide while minimizing losses due to impedance mismatching, discontinuities and the like. As dielectric constants increase the diameter must decrease to maintain the same frequency performance and creates manufacturing difficulties due to small physical size and tightness of waveguide component tolerances.<br>
The venting provided by permitting the 0-ring 78 to extrude into lobes 76A and 76B (see Figure 4), and allowing a separation gap between mounting flange 24 and housing to flange adapter 40 as the capscrews or bolts stretch must occur at a lower pressure than the pressure that caused a failure of the primary mechanical process seal 54.  For example, if the primary process seal 54<br><br>
fails at 100 psi process pressure, the venting between the mounting flange 24 and housing to flange adapter 40 should occur at a substantially lower pressure than 100 psi to protect the secondary seal from the full force of the process pressure. This insures that the process pressure is safely released along a long, flame quenching path before the secondary barrier releases or fails.<br>
Although the present  invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
