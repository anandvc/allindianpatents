				<td>METHOD FOR IMPLEMENTING MOBILE MANAGEMENT OF FIXED TERMINALS IN<br>
COMMUNICATION NETWORK<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[1] The present invention relates to communication technology field, in particular to a method for implementing mobile management of fixed terminals in communication network.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
|2J In a mobile communication network, mobile subscriber information is managed centrally by a unified home location register (HLR), so as to supply mobile management to mobile terminals. HLR also serves as the authentication center for mobile subscribers, serves as an entity in which the data of mobile subscribers for authentication and encryption is stored. As the home location information of mobile subscribers is stored in HLR, thus the mobile communication network is enabled to make the terminals to be movable and can effectively mask off the difference of service capability between end offices, so as to provide unified services for the network. [3] However, in a fixed communication network, subscribers' authority data and new service data are stored in the exchange of end offices, and an end office access the local database directly to obtain corresponding<br>
information, and accomplish the relevant call processing function. As a result, the subscriber's number must be bound with the end office, i.e., the data must be bound at the end office, and it is impossible for the subscribers to roam in the local network and migrate across offices ,etc.; in addition, as the services are provided by end offices and there are different types of equipments in end offices, the service provision capabilities of the equipments in the individual end offices are different from each other; as a result, in the existing fixed communication networks, it is difficult to provide or generalize unified services across the entire network; and, the data storage pattern in the above-mentioned fixed communication networks also brings a problem that the intelligent services being hard to trigger in end offices.<br>
[4j Though there is a unified home location register (HLR) ,which serves as database to manage the mobile subscriber information centrally , and serves as the authentication center for mobile subscribers to store mobile subscribers' data for authentication and encryption in an existing mobile communication network. As shown in Fig.l, the mobile switching center (MSC) is interconnected with the HLR through the MAP (mobile application part), the location information of the subscribers, the information of new services are stored in the HLR, the Mobile Switching Center (MSC ), the Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) interacts with the HLR through MAP protocol to obtain<br>
subscribers' location information and new service information and achieve basic call functions for subscribers. Apparently, as the mobile HLR is oriented to services for mobile communication networks, is interconnected with the Mobile Switching Center through MAP protocol. The MAP protocol is a protocol for mobile communication networks, is not supported by exchanges in fixed networks, so it can't be applied in fixed communication networks. [5] In fixed communication networks, the intelligent services without access code are triggered in end offices. In which, the calling-type intelligent services need to be triggered by the calling end office, the intelligent services at the calling side, such as fixed prepay service, are triggered in the following way: the access code is inserted before the called number by the calling end office, and is sent to the SSP (service switching point) for service triggering; however, there are many types of exchanges in end offices in networks presently, it is impossible to insert access code before the called number automatically; therefore, it is difficult to implement the above-mentioned service triggering. In which the called-type intelligent services are triggered by the called end office; the intelligent services at called side may include Simultaneous Ringing Service, Color Ring Back Tone Service (CRBTS), Unified Message Service (UMS), and wide area CENTREX(Central Office Exchange Service), etc., In which, the Simultaneous Ringing Service refers that a subscriber can register a certain number of<br>
Simultaneous Ringing numbers, and all the Simultaneous Ringing numbers would ring simultaneously or in sequence when the subscriber had an incoming call, so as to locate the called subscriber in time; the CRBT Service refers that a subscriber in a fixed network can customize various signal tones of the call connection phase for the current telephone, for instance, when the calling party is hearing the ring-back tone in the ringing phase, various speech can be customized to replace the ring-back tone so that the calling party listen to the customized speech; the Unified Message Service, i.e., the Universal Personal Number, refers that a subscriber has one personal number and when the subscriber is roaming, by dialing registration, the call to that personal number would be connected onto the registered number automatically; the wide area CENTREX refers that a part of the subscribers on exchange of fixed network are virtualized into one subscriber group, in which the subscribers can dial with shortened numbers to each other to implement the function of the private branch exchange. [6]  The triggering of the intelligent services at the called side is in the following way: the destination end office (i.e., the called end office) inserts the access before the called number , which is sent to the SSP(service switching point) for service triggering; after the service is triggered, SSP re-connects the call to the destination end office; however, the called end office is usually unable to connect the call to<br>
SSP; even if the called end office connects the call to SSP , SSP needs to re-connect the call to the end office after service processing is finished, the called end office would again send the call to SSP for triggering, this results in repeated triggering and waste of voice channel, and even call failure. Therefore, it is impossible for the prior art to prevent repeated call triggering to SSP.<br>
Stannary of the Invention<br>
[7] In view of the above-mentioned problems existed in the prior art, It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for implementing mobile management of the fixed terminals in communication networks, so that it is possible for the fixed terminals in fixed communication networks to realize service functions such as roaming in home network and migrating across offices etc..<br>
|8] The present invention is implemented by the following technical solution:<br>
J9] The present invention provides a method for implementing mobile management of the fixed terminals in communication networks, comprising: A. establishing an integrated Home Location Register in which the subscriber information of fixed subscriber terminals in a fixed communication network is stored;<br>
B. when a fixed subscriber terminal in the fixed communication network initiating a call, performing the corresponding call processing in accordance with the subscriber information stored in said integrated Home Location Register.<br>
[10]  Said step A comprises:<br>
[11] Establishing an integrated Home Location Register in which the subscriber information of fixed subscriber terminals in PSTN(Public Switching Telephone Network) is stored;<br>
[12]  Said step A comprises:<br>
[13] Establishing an integrated Home Location Register in which stores the subscriber information of fixed subscriber terminals in PSTN(Public Switching Telephone Network) ,and the subscriber information of mobile subscriber terminals in the PLMN ( Public Land Mobile Network), PHS ( Personal Handyphone System) and 3G( the third Generation mobile communication networks);<br>
[14]  Said subscriber information comprises:<br>
[15] Routing information and subscription information of the fixed subscriber terminals and mobile subscriber terminals; said subscription information comprises subscriber's real number information, subscription information of fixed prepay service, subscription information of Simultaneous Ringing Service, subscription information of color ringing<br>
Service, subscription information of Unified Message Service, and subscription information of wide area Central Office Exchange Service CENTREX.<br>
[16] Said integrated Home Location Register is interconnected with PSTN, PLMN, 3G, and PHS networks respectively, that is, the exchanges in those networks exchange data with the integrated Home Location Register; and said integrated Home Location Register also share data with the SCPs (Service Control Points).<br>
[17] Said exchanges in the individual networks exchange data with the integrated Home Location Register in the following way: the exchanges in the individual networks exchange data with the integrated Home Location Register via ISUP (ISDN User Part)interface, INAP (Intelligent Network Application Protocol } interface, and MAP( Mobile Application Part) interface.<br>
[18J  Said step B comprises:<br>
Bl. A fixed subscriber terminal in the fixed communication network initiating a call to the exchange;<br>
B2. The exchange connecting the call to said integrated Home Location Register;<br>
B3. Determining the real number of the subscriber In accordance with the subscriber information stored in said integrated Home Location Register,<br>
and returning said real number to the exchange;<br>
B4. Said exchange initiating the call with said real number.<br>
[19]  Said step B3 comprises:<br>
(20J Said integrated Home Location Register determining the subscriber's real number in the subscriber information stored therein in accordance with the subscriber number of the fixed subscriber terminal which initiates the call, and returning said real number to the exchange.<br>
[21]  Said step B3 further comprises:<br>
B31. Determining the subscriber's intelligent service access number in accordance with the subscriber information stored in said integrated Home Location Register, and then inserting said intelligent service access number into the called subscriber number;<br>
B32. Connecting said call to the SSP (Service Switching Point) for the intelligent service triggering.<br>
[2ZJ Said intelligent services may include: fixed prepay service, Simultaneous Ringing Service, color ringing Service, Unified Message Service, and wide area CENTREX (Central Office Exchange Service).<br>
[23] It can be seen from the above-mentioned technical solutions provided in the present invention that, since the present invention provides for the subscribers in fixed communication network a centralized database as the Home Location Register in a mobile communication network , the existence<br>
of said database can effectively mask off the difference between the service provision capability of the individual end offices , providing unified services for the subscribers in the fixed communication network; Meanwhile, a fixed communication network is also enabled to have the service features of a mobile communication network, that is, as for the mobile subscribers, it can also be implemented for the fixed subscriber terminals to realize service functions such as roaming in home network, and migrating across offices, etc.; furthermore, it is also possible to combine the fixed subscribers and the mobile subscribers, so as to deploy integrated services including combined number issuance to the fixed subscribers and the mobile subscribers, migration of PHS subscribers to 3G networks without changing the phone number, integrated CENTREX(Central Office Exchange Service), and triggering of the intelligent services across the entire network. In addition, the intelligent services at the called side are also triggered by the calling end office centrally after querying the Home Location Register in the present invention, thus, the problem of repeated triggering to the SSP, which exists in the called end office, is avoided.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
[30] The main object of the present invention is to establish a Home Location Register for the fixed subscriber terminals, i.e., an integrated HLR, in which the subscriber information of subscriber terminals in fixed communication network is stored and managed centrally, said subscriber information includes the routing information of the subscribers and the subscription information of intelligent services, etc., thus the subscriber terminals in fixed communication network are enabled to have features of the subscriber terminals in mobile communication network, such as roaming, migrating across offices without changing phone number, etc., and the triggering problem of intelligent services across the entire network is<br>
solved by the Home Location Register. Meanwhile, said integrated HLR can also function as the Home Location Register of PHS network, PLMN network, and 3G network, so as to provide the integrated carriers of the future with services fused from the fixed, mobile communication networks. [31] In the present invention, first, a centralized database ,i.e., the integrated HLR, is provided for the fixed subscriber terminals, to store the routing information of the subscribers and subscription information of services, which enables the fixed subscribers to roam across offices ,and provides unified services for the fixed subscribers; second, said centralized database for the fixed subscriber terminals incorporates the functions of mobile HLR at the same time ,and becomes an integrated HLR, that is, to provide a unified database for PSTN, PHS, PLMN, and 3G networks at the same time, which is used to store the routing information of the mobile subscribers and the fixed subscriber and the corresponding service subscription information, said service subscription information may be: the subscriber' s real number, subscription information of fixed prepay service, subscription information of Simultaneous Ringing Service, subscription information of the color ringing Service, subscription information of Unified Message Service, and subscription information of wide area CENTREX (Central Office Exchange Service), etc., so as to develop the combined number issuance service fused from the fixed and mobile communication network,<br>
integrated CENTREX (Central Office Exchange Service), and triggering of the intelligent services across the entire network, etc.; finally, the integrated HLR also provides fixed-communication-network-based ISUP(ISDN User Part) interfaces and INAP signaling interfaces, to be interfaced directly to fixed communication network through ISUP, INAP protocols. Furthermore, the integrated HLR provides a MAP signaling interface based on mobile network , to be interconnected with PHS network and 3G network, so that the data stored in the integrated HLR could be shared with SCPs (Service Control Points) in intelligent network, in order to deploy the corresponding intelligent services and implement the triggering of intelligent services across the entire network.<br>
In the present invention, all of the calls are sent to the integrated HLR first, the real numbers of the subscriber terminals are obtained in the integrated HLR, and the call connect processing is performed in accordance with the real numbers. As a result, with the present invention, it is possible to implement combined number provision, fixed network NP ( number portability ), and intelligent services triggering across the entire network.<br>
[33] Said combined number issuance means centralized management of the subscriber numbers in communication network, each subscriber would have two numbers, one is a public logical number (e.g., a mobile phone number held<br>
by a mobile subscriber), the other is a physical number that determines the home location of the subscriber, though the physical number may be migrated across offices and changed when needed, the logical number remains unchanged, due to the existence of the integrate HLR, the subscriber numbers issued to the individual subscribers can then be coded and issued according to practical requirements, for example, combined number issuance can be implemented among fixed subscribers ,and also among the fixed and mobile subscribers, in addition, NP function is also implemented in fixed network, that is, subscriber numbers in fixed communication network are no longer restricted to use in fixed physical locations; instead, as the mobile subscribers, the subscriber number held would remain unchanged, and may deploy communication service normally ,when changing the physical location, this provides great convenience for the fixed subscriber terminals to make use of communication networks.<br>
[34] Said intelligent services triggering across the entire network is implemented as follows: The subscription information of intelligent services of the subscribers is stored in the integrated HLR, for the subscriber call with intelligent service authority, after analyzing the intelligent service subscription information, the integrated HLR automatically inserts the corresponding intelligent service access code before the called number, and routes the call to SSP (Service Switching Point), to accomplish the triggering<br>
of the corresponding intelligent service. Thus, in the present invention, intelligent services at the called side are all triggered centrally by the calling end office after querying the integrated HLR, so as to avoid the problem that the call cannot reach its destination due to the repeated service triggering to SSP, which exists during the intelligent service triggering implemented by the called end office in the prior art.<br>
[35] The present invention is described in brief as above. The embodiments of the method described in the present invention are described hereunder, in conjunction with the attached drawings, as shown in Fig. 3, specifically, it comprises the following steps:<br>
P6J step 31: establish an integrated Home Location Register (i .e. integrated HLR); in said integrated HLR , stores the subscriber information of subscriber terminals in the individual networks respectively, including subscriber's routing information and service subscription information etc.;<br>
[37] said individual networks include fixed communication networks and mobile communication networks, particularly, include PSTN, PLMN, 3G, and PHS networks, etc.;<br>
[38J step 32: said integrated HLR is interconnected with PSTN, PLMN, 3G, and PHS networks respectively, that is, the exchanges in the individual networks exchange information with the integrated HLR respectively, to obtain subscriber information of the corresponding subscriber terminals, said<br>
obtained subscriber information may be subscriber's real number, access code<br>
of intelligent service, etc.; J39J  step 33: the exchanges in the individual networks accomplish the<br>
corresponding call connection processing in accordance with the obtained<br>
subscriber information of subscriber terminals; [40]  In the present invention, the above-mentioned service processing<br>
procedure can be implemented with the following two solutions in the fixed<br>
communication   network:    ISUP-signaling-based   solution,    and<br>
INAP-signaling-based solution; [41]  where, the ISUP-signaling-based service processing flow is shown in<br>
Fig.4 , comprising the following steps: [423  step 41: the calling subscriber in end office 1 (the end office to which<br>
the calling subscriber belongs) initiates a call, and the call is sent to<br>
the integrated HLR, that is, sends IAM(Initial Address Message ) to the<br>
integrated HLR; [43]  step 42: After looking up and analyzing the calling number, if the<br>
subscribers initiating the call has registered the corresponding service<br>
and requires the calling number to be converted, the integrated HLR would<br>
return the converted calling number to the exchange in end office 1 through<br>
ACM(Address Complete Message); [44]  step 43: meanwhile, After looking up and analyzing the called number,<br>
if the subscribers initiating the call has registered the corresponding service and requires the called number to be converted, the integrated HLR sends the link between the releasing end office and the integrated HLR through REL(Release Message), and returns the converted called number at the same time, so that the exchange in the end office can re-analyze the called number and re-select channel with the REL message;<br>
[45] step 44 : After receiving the REL message, end office 1 sends RLC (release complete message) to the integrated HLR, disconnect the relay circuit connected to the integrated HLR;<br>
[46] step 45: the exchange in end office 1 sends IAM to end office 2 (the end office to which the called subscriber belongs) in accordance with the information obtained from the integrated HLR;<br>
[47] step 46, After receiving the IAM from end office 1, end office 2 returns ACM to end office 1.<br>
[48] The end office reinitiates a new call in accordance with the calling and called numbers returned from the HLR, the particular call processing procedure is identical to that in the prior art, the difference is only that the calling and called numbers have been changed.<br>
[49] Where, the service processing flow based on INAP signaling is shown in Fig.5, comprising the following steps:<br>
[50]  step 51: For the call initiated by a subscriber in an end office in fixed<br>
network , and the corresponding intelligent service is triggered through SSP, then the SSP reports the calling and called numbers to the integrated HLR trough InitialDP(Initial Detection Point);<br>
[51] step 52: The integrated HLR configures the corresponding event detection point, and requests the SSP to report the detected events at the corresponding detection point to the integrated HLR;<br>
[52]  step 53: the integrated HLR issues "Connect" operation to SSP;<br>
[53] step 54: After detecting the corresponding detection point events, the SSP reports to the integrated HLR, for example, after detecting the corresponding detection point events, such as calling attempt, information acquisition, or information analysis, the SSP reports to the integrated HLR;<br>
[54] step 55: After receiving the reported detection point events, the integrated HLR disconnects the corresponding connection via the SSP;<br>
[55] where, if step 52, 54, and 55 are not executed, the "Connect" operation in step 53 issues the operation issuance of "end session " to SSP through the integrated HLR.<br>
[56] With the integrated HLR in the present invention, integrated services can also be implemented in fixed and mobile communication networks, said integrated services are: to centralize fixed and mobile subscribers into a virtual subscriber group and perform in this subscriber group various types of call processing, including the integrated CENTREX, combined number<br>
issuance for subscribers in fixed and mobile communication networks, migration of PHS subscribers (e.g., Personal Handyphone System subscribers) to 3G subscribers without changing phone number, etc. For example, in the case that a subscriber in an fixed exchange initiates a call to a subscriber in a mobile communication network, the particular service flow is shown in Fig.6, comprising the following steps:<br>
[57] step 61: fixed exchanges, such as LS (end office in fixed network), MS (tandem office) , GW(Gateway exchange), and TS{Toll Switch), etc., submit a call to the integrated HLR through IAM, that is, when a subscriber in the communication network initiates a call, the exchange submits the call to the integrated HLR first, and in the IAM carries the DN (mobile subscriber number) of the called subscriber;<br>
[5ff| step 62: the integrated HLR sends PRN (Request for provision of roaming number) request to the mobile end office VMSC (virtual mobile switching center);<br>
[59] step 63: the mobile end office VMSC sends response of the PRN request to the integrated HLR, in the response provides the mobile roaming number;<br>
[60] step 64: the integrated HLR sends the obtained mobile roaming number to the fixed exchange ,such as fixed end office , tandem office, gateway exchange or toll switch, through REL message;<br>
[61]  step 65: the fixed exchange sends IAM message to the GMSC ( gateway mobile<br>
switching center ), in the IAM message carries the obtained mobile roaming number of the called subscriber;<br>
[62] step 66: the GMSC routes the call to the VMSC through IAM message, and the subsequent call processing is performed by the VMSC , the call processing flow is identical with that in the prior art.<br>
[63] With the present invention, a centralized database ,i.e., integrated HLR, is available to fixed communication network, as to mobile communication network, in addition, the existence of the integrated HLR can mask off the difference between the service provision capability of the individual end offices effectively, and provide unified services for subscribers in fixed network. Thereby, the fixed communication network is enabled to have the service features of the mobile communication network , that is, as for the mobile subscribers, it can also be implemented for the fixed subscribers to migrate across offices without changing the phone number; furthermore, with the integrated HLR , it is also possible to combine the fixed subscribers and the mobile subscribers, to deploy services including combined number issuance to the fixed subscribers and the mobile subscribers, migration of PHS subscribers to 3G networks without changing the phone number, integrated CENTREX, and triggering of the intelligent services across the entire network, etc.<br>
[64]  What described above is only the more preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, and the protected scope of the present invention is not limited to those. The variation and replacement which those skilled in the art can easily make within the technical area disclosed in the present invention should fall in the protected scope of the present invention.
