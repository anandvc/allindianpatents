				<td>Oil-based suspension concentrates<br>
The present invention relates to new, oil-based suspension concentrates of active agrochemicals, to a process for producing these formulations and to their use for applying the active substances comprised.<br>
Systemic active agrochemicals, especially systemic insecticides, in order to develop their biological effect, need a formulation which enables the active substances to be taken up into the plant/target organisms. Usually, therefore, systemic active agrochemicals are formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), soluble liquid (SL) and/or oil-based suspension concentrate (OD). In an EC and SL the active substance is in dissolved form, while in the case of an OD formulation it is a solid. In the latter case the biological action is made possible by the addition of penetrants. Contact actives such as pyrethroids, for example, are formulated preferably as EC, especially when a high initial action is needed. Suspension concentrates (SC) or wettable granules (WG) are technically possible in the majority of cases, but do not display the requisite initial action.<br>
Mixed formulations of systemic and contact insecticides, such as a mixture of imidacloprid with beta-cyfluthrin, for example, are of great interest as an alternative to the organophosphates, which carry high acute toxicity. Mixtures of this kind are appropriate alternatives to the application of organophosphates only if a high initial action is present and if formulations with a high active substance content are present. There are no known EC formulations with high levels both of imidacloprid and of beta-cyfluthrin, since there is no solvent able to dissolve both active substances in appropriate amount. Consequently, only oil-based or water-free suspension concentrates come into consideration.<br>
Numerous water-free suspension concentrates of active agrochemicals have already been disclosed. For instance EP-A 0 789 999 describes formulations of this type which in addition to active substance and oil comprise a mixture of different surfactants - including surfactants which serve as penetrants - and also a hydrophobicized aluminophyllosilicate as thickener. The cited patent describes suitable active substances as being those which have a solubility in oil of less than 5 g/1, preferably less than 1 g/1, in particular less than 0.1 g/1.<br>
From US-A 6 165940, moreover, non-aqueous suspension concentrates are already known in which besides active agrochemical, penetrant and surfactant or surfactant mixture there is an organic solvent, suitable solvents of this type including liquid paraffin or vegetable oil esters. That invention describes suspension concentrates composed of solid active substance(s) and organic solvents, the active substance being less than moderately soluble. A solubility of less than 10 g/1, preferably less than 5 g/1, is explicitly stated.<br>
 <br>
DE-A 10 129 855 describes further oil-based suspension concentrates which comprise active agrochemicals, penetrants and surfactants.<br>
A disadvantage of the aforementioned formulations is that it is not possible to develop a sparingly soluble (less than 10 g/1) active substance in combination with a moderately soluble (10 to 50 g/1 at room temperature) active substance in the form of a stable oil-based suspension concentrate without the occurrence of crystal growth after storage. The growth of active substance crystals in a formulation is a considerable disadvantage for the user, since it may result in clogging of the screens of his or her spraying equipment when the product is applied.<br>
An objective of the present invention is to develop stable, storable, oil-based suspension concentrates composed of a sparingly soluble active substance and a moderately soluble active substance which is present in a higher concentration than the solubility limit in the formulation.<br>
New, oil-based suspension concentrates have now been found, comprising<br>
at least one room-temperature-solid active substance from the class of the neonicotinoids,<br>
at least one room-temperature-solid active substance from the class of the pyrethroids,<br>
at least one penetrant,<br>
at least one vegetable oil,<br>
cyclohexanone,<br>
at least one nonionic surfactant and/or at least one anionic surfactant, and<br>
one or more additives from the groups of the emulsifiers, foam inhibitors, preservatives,<br>
antioxidants, spreaders, colorants and/or a thickener.<br>
Suitable penetrants in the present context include all those substances which are usually used to enhance the penetration of active agrochemicals into plants. Penetrants are defined in this context by their ability to penetrate from the aqueous spray liquor and/or from the spray coating into the cuticle of the plant and thereby to increase the mobility of active substances in the cuticle. The method described later on and in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science 51, 131-152) can be used to determine this property.<br>
Additionally it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention can be produced by mixing<br>
at least one room-temperature-solid active substance from the class of the neonicotinoids, at least one room-temperature-solid active substance from the class of the pyrethroids, at least one penetrant, at least one vegetable oil,<br>
 <br>
cyclohexanone,<br>
at least one non ionic surfactant and/or at least one anionic surfactant, and<br>
one or more additives from the groups of the emulsifiers, foam inhibitors, preservatives,<br>
antioxidants, spreaders, colorants and/or a thickener.<br>
with one another and optionally subsequently grinding the resultant suspension.<br>
Finally it has been found that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are highly suitable for applying the active agrochemicals comprised to plants and/or their habitat.<br>
It is to be considered extremely surprising that the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention exhibit very good stability, and in particular that no significant crystal growth was observed even after storage at fluctuating temperature. Also unexpected is the fact that they display a markedly better biological activity than the aforementioned formulations most similar in composition. Particularly unexpected is the fact that a very high initial action of the contact substance is found, in spite of the fact that this active substance is present partly as a solid.<br>
Appropriate active substances are insecticides from the class of the neonicotinoids. They are outstandingly suitable for controlling animal pests. Insecticides from the class of the neonicotinoids can be described by formula (II) below<br>

The amount of the individual components can be varied within a relatively wide range in the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention. Thus the concentrations<br>
of active agrochemicals are between 5% and 40%, preferably between 10% and 37.5%, very preferably between 12.5% and 35% by weight,<br>
of penetrant are between 5% and 55%, preferably between 10% and 35% by weight, of vegetable oil are between 15% and 55%, preferably between 20% and 50% by weight, of cyclohexanone are between 5% and 20%, preferably between 7% and 16% by weight,<br>
of surfactants and/or dispersants are between 2.5% and 30%, preferably between 5.0% and 25% by weight, and<br>
of additives are between 0.1% and 25%, preferably between 0.1% and 20% by weight.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention are produced by mixing the components with one another in the respectively desired proportions. The order in which the constituents are<br>
 <br>
combined with one another is arbitrary. Appropriately the solid components are used in a finely ground state. It is, however, also possible to subject the suspension which results after the constituents have been combined first to a coarse grinding and then to a fine grinding, so that the mean particle size is below 20 urn. Preferred suspension concentrates are those in which the solid particles have a mean size between 1 and 10 um.<br>
The temperatures when carrying out the process of the invention can be varied within a certain range. The work is carried out generally at temperatures between 10°C and 60°C, preferably between 15°Cand40°C.<br>
Equipment suitable for carrying out the process of the invention includes customary mixing and grinding apparatus which is used for producing agrochemical formulations.<br>
The oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention constitute formulations which remain stable even following prolonged storage at elevated temperatures or in the cold, since no significant crystal growth is observed. By dilution with water they can be converted into homogeneous spray liquids. These spray liquids are applied by customary methods, i.e., for example, by spraying, pouring or injecting.<br>
The application rate of the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It is guided by the particular active agrochemicals and by their amount in the formulations.<br>
With the aid of the oil-based suspension concentrates of the invention it is possible to deliver active agrochemicals particularly from the class of the neonicotinoids, to plants and/or their habitat in a particularly advantageous way.<br>
With the formulations of the invention it is possible to treat all plants and plant parts. By plants here are meant all plants and plant populations, such as desirable and unwanted wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and gene-technological methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by varietal property rights. By plant parts are to be meant all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, an exemplary listing embracing leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and also vegetative and generative propagation material, examples being seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
 <br>
What may be emphasized in this context is the particularly advantageous effect of the compositions according to the invention with regard to their use in cereal plants such as, for example, wheat, oats, barley, spelt, triticale and rye, but also in maize, sorghum and millet, rice, sugar cane, soya beans, sunflowers, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape, canola, tobacco, sugar beet, fodder beet, asparagus, hops and fruit plants (comprising pome fruit such as, for example, apples and pears, stone fruit such as, for example, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums and apricots, citrus fruits such as, for example, oranges, grapefruits, limes, lemons, kumquats, tangerines and satsumas, nuts such as, for example, pistachios, almonds, walnuts and pecan nuts, tropical fruits such as, for example, mango, papaya, pineapple, dates and bananas, and grapes) and vegetables (comprising leaf vegetables such as, for example, endives, corn salad, Florence fennel, lettuce, cos lettuce, Swiss chard, spinach and chicory for salad use, cabbages such as, for example, cauliflower, broccoli, Chinese leaves, Brassica oleracea (L.) convar. acephala var. sabellica L. (curly kale, feathered cabbage), kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, red cabbage, white cabbage and Savoy cabbage, fruit vegetables such as, for example, aubergines, cucumbers, capsicums, table pumpkins, tomatoes, courgettes and sweetcorn, root vegetables such as, for example celeriac, wild turnips, carrots, including yellow cultivars, Raphanus sativus var. niger and var. radicula, beetroot, scorzonera and celery, legumes such as, for example, peas and beans, and vegetables from the Allium family such as, for example, leeks and onions).<br>
The treatment of the plants and plant parts in accordance with the invention with the inventive formulations is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area in accordance with the customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, vaporizing, atomizing, broadcasting or painting on and, in the case of propagation material, especially seeds, additionally by single or multiple coating.<br>
The active agrochemicals comprised develop a better biological activity than when applied in the form of the corresponding conventional formulations.<br>

Crystallization behaviour<br>
The crystallization behaviour is investigated by storing 100 ml of formulation for eight weeks under fluctuating temperature conditions. The temperature conditions are as follows:<br>
•	48 hours at 30°C,<br>
•	reduction in temperature over 22.5 hours at 2°C/hour down to -15°C,<br>
•	75hoursat-15°C,<br>
•	increase in temperature over 22.5 hours at 2°C/hour up to 30°C.<br>
Following storage, the sample is brought to room temperature and the crystallization behaviour is examined.<br>
The crystallization properties are tested by pumping 500 ml in each case of an aqueous spray liquor with a concentrate content of 0.5% by weight in circulation in a flow-traversed apparatus,<br>
 <br>
by means of a pump, through a fine-meshed screen for 30 minutes. In the course of this procedure the flow over the screen is measured. At the same level of flow, forty repetitions of this operation are carried out, with 500 ml of freshly employed spray liquor in each case. Crystal growth in the formulations tested will lead to blocking of the screen and so will cause a loss of flow over the screen. If the flow is below 20%, the measurement cycle is discontinued. By way of example, 2 results are reproduced as graphs. Graph 1 shows the result of a flow test with an inventive formulation, for which the flow is still unchanged after forty cycles (20 hours). Graph 2 shows the result for a comparative formula. After four cycles (2 hours) the flow has dropped to 20% (see Figures 1 and 2).<br>

Use Example II: Crystallization behaviour<br>
After eight weeks of storage of the formulation under fluctuating temperature conditions at 54°C the growth of the active substance crystals is determined by means of light microscopy. Immediately after production, all formulations exhibit particle sizes of up to 10 micrometres. All of the inventive formulations exhibit particle sizes after storage of up to a maximum of 20 micrometres. The comparative formulations exhibit substantially coarser particles, up to more than 100 micrometres (see Figures 3 to 5).<br>

Test description: penetrants at the level of the cuticle<br>
Additives which act as penetrants at the level of the cuticle may be referred to below as accelerator additives (cf. Schonherr and Baur, 1994, Pesticide Science 42, 185-208). The characterizing feature of accelerator additives is their ability to penetrate from the aqueous spray liquor and/or from the spray coating into the cuticle and thereby to increase the mobility of active substances in the cuticle. Other additives such as polyethylene glycol, in contrast, act only in the spray coating (via the liquid phase) or act only as wetting agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, for example.<br>
This test determines the influence of additives on the penetration properties of other substances at the level of the cuticle. The mobility of a test substance in the cuticle is measured with and without an additive, via a desorption method. The method is published in detail in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science, 51, 131-152), and only the principles and deviations are described below.<br>
As a test substance with the function of a tracer a selection was made here of a radiolabelled weak organic acid. Plant material used comprised the enzymatically isolated leaf cuticles of the top face of peach leaves from outdoor trees. The cuticles were installed in specially manufactured stainless steel diffusion cells. The tracer, in a citrate buffer at a pH of 3 in the dissolved state, was applied to the side originally facing the inside of the leaf. This inner side readily takes up the small radioactive amount of the tracer in the undissociated acid form. Subsequently this inner side was covered and maintained at 100% atmospheric humidity. The morphological outer side of the leaf cuticle, normally exposed to the air, was then contacted with a buffer (pH 7), with the receptor solution, and desorption was started. The penetrated acid form of the test substance is dissociated by the receptor and the desorption follows first-order kinetics. The desorption constant is proportional to the mobility of the tracer in the cuticle.<br>
After at least 2 times for determining this constant, desorption is then continued with a buffer which additionally includes the test additive. Depending on the property of the additive there is then sorption of the additive in the cuticle and, depending on its activity as a plasticizer for the cuticle, there is an increase in the mobility of the tracer within the cuticle. This is manifested in an increased desorption constant, and the ratio of the slopes with additive to the slope without additive describes the effect of the additive to act as a penetrant at the -level of the cuticle. The comparison of the average effect of different additives shows their effectiveness to act as cuticle plasticizers.<br>
