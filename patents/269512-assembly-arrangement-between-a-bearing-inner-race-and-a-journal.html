9 The present invention relates to assembly arrangement between a bearing inner race and a<br>
journal, race and journal suitable for such an arrangement, and turbomachine fitted therewith<br>

Field of the Invention<br>
" . *<br>
The' present invention relates to the assembly between<br>
an inner race of a bearing and a journal guided in<br>
10 rotation by this bearing.<br>
It is aimed at an assembly arrangement making it.<br>
possible to assemble the inner race and the journal.<br>
V.' It is aimed at a bearing inner race suitable for such • ,<br>
an assembly arrangement, and a journal suitable for<br>
such an assembly arrangement. .<br>
Finally it is aimed at a turbomachine fitted with such<br>
2(',- a bearing inner race and/or such a journal and/or<br>
..fitted with such an assembly arrangement.<br>
Background of the Invention '<br>
2t In all of the following, the term "journal" will be<br>
used which must be understood as being any' similar'part<br>
or belonging to a rotating shaft.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate, schematically and in axial<br>
3( section, respectively two known arrangements of the<br>
assembly between a journal and a bearing inner race. In<br>
these two examples, the bearing is a roller bearing.<br>
"Axial section" means a section taken along the<br>
3,1 longitudinal axis, of the journal. In these tw6 figures,,<br>
similar elements bear similar reference.numbers.<br>
Reference number 102 indicates a journal having an axis<br>
^ 104. The journal 102 is supported by a bearing having a<br>
bearing inner race 106 and a bearing, outer race 108.<br>
Between the bearing inner race 106 and the bearing<br>
5 "outer race 108 there are rollers 110. The bearing outer<br>
race is attached to.a fixed part 112. The bearing inner<br>
race 106 is attached to the journal 102.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an assembly arrangement in which '<br>
13 the bearing inner race 106 is attached to an end of the<br>
journal 102 by means of a weld 116.<br>
The bearing inner race 106 forms here an extension of<br>
(' ,, , the journal 102. In other words, this configuration is<br>
15 similar to a configuration in which the rollers 110<br>
would be directly incorporated into the journal 102.<br>
Such an, assembly arrangement by welding has,<br>
disadvantages. Specifically, the bearing inner race 106<br>
2) and the journal 102 are made of different materials. It '<br>
is often difficult to make a firm weld between two'<br>
parts made of different materials. In addition, when<br>
. &gt; such a weld is made, the lifetime of the assembly is<br>
not always satisfactory.<br>
2 5<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an assembly arrangement in which<br>
the bearing inner race 106 is mounted by being clamped<br>
.axially against a shoulder 118 of the journal 102, and ,<br>
attached by means of a clamping nut 120. An anti-<br>
3) rotation device 122 associated with the clamping nut<br>
120 prevents rotation of the latter relative to the<br>
journal 102.<br>
Such a mechanical assembly . by clamping nut does not<br>
3) have - the disadvantage specific to an assembly by<br>
weldirig. However it has, another disadvantage linked to<br>
the bulk of the assembly. Specifically, in<br>
turbomachines designed to receive such assemblies, it<br>
' 3 -<br>
'. is increasingly necessary to limit the axial length of<br>
j ^ ^ the journal or of the rotating shaft. The presence of<br>
the clamping nut 120 and its anti-rotation device 122<br>
placed at the end of the journal 102 beyond the bearing<br>
,) inner race 106, requires the axial length of the<br>
journal 102 to be greater than the axial length of a<br>
journal 102 suitable for an assembly by welding.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an •<br>
i<br>
I') assembly arrangement of an inner race and a journal .<br>
. that does not have the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
More precisely, an object of the present invention is<br>
( to provide an assembly arrangement that is mechanical<br>
1,)'. and that does not require an increase in. the axial<br>
.length of the journal.<br>
In everything that follows, the "bearing inner race",<br>
.respectively the "bearing outer race", will simply be<br>
2) called "inner race", respectively "outer race".<br>

with reference to Figure 1, an assembly arrangement is<br>
^ shown according to the invention. A journal 2 having an.<br>
axis 4 is supported in rotation by a bearing which<br>
comprises an inner race 6 and an outer race 8. In the '<br>
.5 example illustrated, the bearing is a roller bearing,,<br>
and rollers 10 are placed between the outer race 8 and<br>
the inner race 6.<br>
The bearing outer race 108 is attached to a fixed part<br>
13 12. . .<br>
The inner race 6 comprises a race body 60, which<br>
interacts with the outer race 8 via the rollers 10 to<br>
I provide the rolling action. It also comprises a first<br>
15 race end 62 and a second race end 64,. which are annular<br>
parts extending either side of. the race body 60 in the<br>
axial direction.. It further comprises a race inner face<br>
66 and a race outer face 68.<br>
2 3 The journal 2 comprises an axis 4, a journal outer.face<br>
24 and a journal end 50.<br>
The journal 2 and the inner race 6 are assembled;<br>
together by means of first race assembly means 26, 28,<br>
25 30, second race assembly means 32, first journal •<br>
assembly means 36, second journal assembly means 3 8 and<br>
additional assembly means 40.<br>
The first race assembly means 26, 28, 3 0 comprise a<br>
3 3 race annular groove 26 made on the race inner face 66,<br>
at the first race end 62.<br>
The first race assembly means 26, 28, 30 also comprise<br>
a bevel 2 8 made on the race inner face 66, at the<br>
3 5 extremity of the first race end 62 and in the vicinity<br>
of the race annular groove 26.<br>
• — • " T S '<br>
' The first race assembly means 26, 28, 30 further<br>
^ comprise at least one opening 30 which traverses the<br>
I inner race 6 radially. Each opening 3 0 connects the<br>
: race annular groove 2 6 and the race outer face 68. When<br>
5 several • openings 3 0 are present, they can be ' •<br>
distributed radially on the inner race 6.<br>
- The second race assembly means 32 comprise at least one<br>
tooth 32, extending radially inwards from the race<br>
1) inner face 66 at the second race end 64. It may _ be a '<br>
single tooth 32 or a plurality of teeth 32<br>
substantially distributed over a circumference of the<br>
race inner face 66, for example equidistant from one<br>
( another. - '<br>
^ , 1 5 ' ' .,,;': 5;<br>
The first journal assembly means 3 6 comprise a journal<br>
annular groove 36 made on the journal outer face 24.<br>
The. second journal assembly means 38 comprise at least ' •<br>
2): one; recess 38 of the journal 2. This may be a single<br>
recess 38, or else a plurality of recesses 38<br>
substantially distributed over a circumference of the<br>
journal outer face 24, for example equidistant from one<br>
another.<br>
25<br>
Each recess 38 may be, for example, a blind hole<br>
machined in the journal 2, or else a longitudinal .<br>
groove machined in the journal 2.<br>
3)' Optionally, the inner race comprises a race shoulder 3,4<br>
extending radially between the race body 60 and the'<br>
first race end 62, and the journal comprises a journal<br>
shoulder 18 extending radially. In the example<br>
illustrated, the race shoulder 34 extends radially<br>
3) inwards and the journal shoulder 18 extends radially<br>
outwards.<br>
The assembly arrangement comprises additional assembly •'<br>
'^ , means 40 which comprise a retaining ring 40.<br>
When the assembly between the inner race 6 and the<br>
,'.' journal 2 is made, the race inner face 66 is opposite<br>
the journal outer face 24.<br>
When the assembly between the inner race 6 and the<br>
. . journal 2 . is made, each tooth 3 2 and the inner race 6<br>
10 -are engaged with a corresponding recess 3 8 of the<br>
journal 2. Thanks to the interaction of the teeth 32<br>
and the recesses 38, the inner race 6 and the journal 2<br>
are prevented from moving in axial rotation relative to<br>
( one another.<br>
l : i ' • _<br>
When the assembly between the inner race 6 and the<br>
journal 2 is made, the race annular groove 2 6 and the<br>
journal annular groove 3 6 interact to form an annular<br>
channel 52 into which the retaining .ring 40 is<br>
20 inserted. Thanks to the inte raction between the I<br>
retaining ring 4 0 and the annular channel 52, the inner<br>
race 6 and the journal 2 are prevented from moving in ^<br>
axial translation relative to one another.<br>
,2.) In addition, the journal 2 is furnished with at least<br>
one journal oil duct 46, placed between the journal / •<br>
, annular groove 36 and the at least one recess 38, which , ,<br>
opens onto the journal outer face 24 in order to carry ','•<br>
oil to the inner race 6 through the journal 2. Equally,<br>
30 the inner race 6 is furnished with race oil ducts ,48,<br>
which traverse it radially, in order to carry oil to<br>
the rollers 10.<br>
Mounting the assembly arrangement comprises the two<br>
3.) operations described below.<br>
During a first operation, the retaining ring 40 is "; '<br>
inserted into the journal annular groove 36.<br>
- IfPreferably,<br>
the retaining ring 40 is furnished with a<br>
^ split , (not shown) to make it easier to insert in the<br>
, journal annular groove 36. This split may be oriented ;,<br>
' i n the radial direction of the retaining ring 40, or it<br>
:i may be oblique to this radial direction. •<br>
During a second operation, the inner race 6 is inserted :<br>
onto the journal 2 via the journal end 50. The presencfe<br>
of the bevel 2 8 on the inner race 6 makes it easier to ' ,<br>
1(1 engage the inner race 6 over the retaining ring 40. • ,<br>
When the inner ra^ce 6 and the journal 2 are furnished .<br>
with respective shoulders 34 and 18, the latter are in<br>
( contact against one another and serve as axial abutment<br>
'l:i to the inner race 6 on the journal 2 in the direction<br>
• of insertion.<br>
In operation, the rotation causes an expansion of the<br>
"retaining ring 40 which presses against the race<br>
2) annular groove 26.<br>
Dismantling the assembly arrangement comprises the<br>
following operation: the retaining ring 4 0 is retracted<br>
from the journal annular groove 3 6 by means of an<br>
2) appropriate tool. For example, a tool, comprising pins<br>
or lugs that penetrate into the openings 3 0 of the<br>
inner race 6 and push out the retaining ring 40, :may be<br>
used. Simultaneously, the inner race 6 is wit'hdrawn<br>
from the journal 2 in the direction of the journal end<br>
