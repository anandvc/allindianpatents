				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cutting inserts having cutting edges formed from a<br>
superhard abrasive material, and methods of making the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the description of the background of the present invention that follows reference is<br>
made to certain structures and methods, however, such references should not necessarily<br>
be construed as an admission that these structures and methods qualify as prior art under<br>
the applicable statutory provisions. Applicants reserve the right to demonstrate that any of<br>
the referenced subject matter does not constitute prior art with regard to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Indexable cutting inserts typically have a polygonal shape with a superhard material<br>
disclosed at the corners thereof. The superhard material, often a cubic boron nitride or<br>
polycrystalline diamond material, aids in the cutting of hard workpiece materials such as<br>
metals. These cutting inserts are typically mounted in a fixed position to a. cutting tool so<br>
as to present one of the corners or areas containing superhard material to the surface of a<br>
workpiece. After being used for a period of time, the area of superhard material becomes<br>
worn. The cutting insert can then be unfastened from the cutting tool and rotated so as to<br>
present a new fresh corner or area of superhard material to the surface of the workpiece.<br><br>
There are two predominant ways of making such inserts. According to one technique, a<br>
stacked structure is formed comprising a first layer of hard backing material and a layer of<br>
superhard cutting material superimposed onto the backing layer. Cutting tips are then cut<br>
from this stacked structure and brazed to a cutting insert body, typically at a corner<br>
thereof. U. S. Patent No. 5,183, 362 to Kuroyama -et al., the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, describes such a technique.<br>
However, several problems are associated with such techniques. The braze joint<br>
connecting the cutting tips to the body of the cutting insert creates an inherent weak point<br>
in the structure. This is particularly true due to the high temperatures that tend to exist<br>
during use of such cutting inserts, these high temperatures being in close proximity to the<br>
braze joint. Another problem posed by such techniques is that the extent of superhard<br>
material presented to the workpiece and available for wear is limited, thus limiting the<br>
useful operating period for that particular cutting edge.<br>
A second technique for forming indexable cutting inserts involves providing a blank or<br>
substrate having pockets formed therein which are filled with superhard material, then<br>
subjecting the blank to a sintering operation which bonds the superhard material to the<br>
substrate. The blank is then subsequently machined to give the cutting insert its final<br>
shape, i. e. -a generally polygonal body with superhard material disposed at the corners<br>
thereof. U. S. Patent No. 5,676,496, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, in its entirety, describes such a technique.<br><br>
Such techniques also present certain difficulties. The process by which the superhard<br>
material is bonded to the blank or substrate is difficult and costly. In this regard, the cost<br>
of the superhard and substrate raw materials are relatively minor when compared with the<br>
costs associated with the process cycle necessary to join them. Thus, from a production<br>
efficiency point of view it would seem preferable to form an indexable insert with many<br>
corners containing superhard material. That way, the number of costly joining process<br>
cycles could be minimized while producing inserts that had many cutting corners.<br>
However, customers of such cutting inserts seem to strongly favor cutting inserts having<br>
relatively few cutting corners, which are more costly to make on a per unit basis using this<br>
technique.<br>
Most cutting inserts sold have only 2-4 cutting corners.<br>
Another disadvantage associated with this second technique is that if a single pocket of<br>
superhard material is defective, the entire insert cannot be sold and may have to be<br>
scrapped. Yet another disadvantage or inefficiency is that only a single cutting insert is<br>
produced from each costly and difficult process cycle.<br>
Thus, a need exists in the art to address the problems discussed above and others.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides devices and methods that address the above-mentioned<br>
problems, and others.<br><br>
The present invention provides improved indexable cutting inserts and improved methods<br>
of producing the same.<br>
According to one aspect, the present-invention provides a method of making a cutting<br>
insert which includes: (i) forming a blank having a substrate and superhard material, the<br>
substrate having more than 4 pockets, the superhard material disposed within the pockets;<br>

providing a cutting insert body having a plurality of cavities for receiving a corresponding<br>
number of cutting tips; (iv) inserting a cutting tip into each of the plurality of cavities; and<br>
(v) brazing the cutting tips to the cutting insert body.<br>
According to further aspect, the present invention provides a cutting insert which includes:<br>
a cutting insert body having a plurality of cavities formed therein; a plurality of cutting<br>
tips, each of the plurality of cutting tips disposed in a respective cavity, the cutting tips<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Exemplary arrangements and techniques according to the present invention will now be<br>
described by reference to the drawing figures.<br><br>
According to the present invention, a blank is formed from a hard material and a superhard<br>
cutting material. The blank having a number of pockets for receiving superhard cutting<br>
material and a superhard cutting material therein. An illustrative embodiment of such a<br>
blank is shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the blank 10 comprises a substrate 12 of<br>
a hard material having a plurality of pockets 14 formed therein. While the blank 10 is<br>
illustrated as having a disk-like shape, other geometries are clearly possible, such as a<br>
polygon. It is also possible to form a through-hole in the blank 10, which may facilitate<br>
handling. Similarly, the pockets 14 may have a size, locations-distribution, and number<br>
with differ from the illustrated embodiment. For example, the pockets 14 are shown as<br>
having a curved or arcuate shape. However, other shapes are clearly contemplated, such as<br>
an oval or a polygon.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, eight pockets 14 are provided in the substrate 12. Other<br>
numbers are clearly possible. As previously discussed, it is an advantage of the present<br>
invention to form the blank 10 with as many pockets 14 for receiving superhard cutting<br>
material as is feasible. Thus, according to one embodiment, the substrate has more than 4<br>
pockets. According to a further embodiment, the substrate has at least 6 pockets.<br>
According to another embodiment, the substrate has at least 8 pockets.<br>
While the illustrated embodiment shows an even number of pockets that are symmetrically<br>
distributed. It is also within the scope of the present invention to provide an odd number of<br>
pockets, such as 7 or 9. It is also contemplated that the pockets can be located in a pattern<br>
that is not symmetrical.<br><br>
The substrate 12 is formed from any suitable hard material. Examples of suitable materials<br>
include cemented carbides, cermets, and hard metal alloys. One suitable composition is a<br>
WC-Co cemented carbide having 10-20 weight % Co, and preferably having 15-17 weight<br>
% Co.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a superhard material 16 is provided in one or more, and preferably<br>
all, of the pockets 14. The superhard material can comprise any suitable material chosen<br>
for its cutting characteristics. The superhard material 16 can initially be provided in the<br>
form-of-a powder. Alternatively, the superhard material 16 can be pre-pressed green<br>
bodies.<br>
The superhard material can comprise a boron nitride, such as cubic boron nitride (CBN),<br>
or a diamond material such as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). The CBN or PCD material<br>
may have additions of other materials, such as carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, oxides,<br>
and/or borides of metals chosen from groups IVa to VIa of the periodic table. The<br>
superhard material 16 can be in the form of a composite of CBN or PCD particles forming<br>
a first phase, and at least a second phase of a semiconductor (e. g. -Si), metal (e. g. -Cu, Ti,<br>
A1), metalloid, or alloys thereof.<br>
After the superhard material 16 is placed within the pockets 14, the blank 10 is then<br>
subjected to a suitable treatment to unite the superhard material 16 and the substrate<br>
material 12. The treatment can comprise a sintering type treatment performed at elevated<br><br>
temperatures and pressures. When the superhard material is initially in the form of a loose<br>
powder, a pressing operation may be performed before or during the sintering treatment,<br>
as described, for example, in U. S. Patent No. 5,676,496. Examples of suitable processes<br>
are described, for example, in U. S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,991,467 and 5,115, 697, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference, in their entirety.<br>
The superhard material 16 preferably extends continuously from a top surface of the blank<br>
10 (visible in Figures 1-2) to an opposing bottom surface of the blank 10 (not visible in<br>
Figures 1-2) and is attached to an edge surface of the substrate 12 defined by the pockets-<br>
L4.---<br>
After above-mentioned step of uniting the superhard material 16 to the substrate 12,<br>
material is then cut or otherwise removed from the blank. For example, the blank 10 can<br>
be cut along lines 18, which define therein the contour of a cutting tip 20.<br>
The cutting tips 20 can be removed by any suitable cutting or material removal/separation<br>
procedure. Once such procedure is wire cutting, such as EDM wire cutting.<br>
The cutting tips can be provided with any suitable geometry. According to one<br>
advantageous aspect of the present invention, the cutting tips 20 are provided with a<br><br>
geometry that will provide a mechanical retention or lock when placed within the body of<br>
an indexable cutting insert, as will be described in more detail.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, a cutting tip 20 which is removed from the blank<br>
10 has a geometry or shape that can generally be characterized as a dovetail shape or<br>
geometry.<br>
A specific illustrative example of this type of cutting tip geometry comprehended by the<br>
present invention is illustrated in Figure 3. The geometry or shape of the cutting tip 20<br>
illustrated in Figure 3 can be described as follows. A pair of converging forward surfaces<br>
22a and 22b meet at a forward nose 24, which is preferably rounded. The nose 24 is<br>
presented to the workpiece during use of the cutting tip. As illustrated in Figure 3, a<br>
portion of the surfaces 22a and 22b, and the nose 24 comprise superhard cutting material<br>
16. The extent of superhard cutting material 16 extending from the-apex-of the nose 24<br>
and back along surfaces 22a and- 22b corresponds to dimension "L", and can be termed<br>
the leg length. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the dimension L is<br>
at least 2mm According to another embodiment, the dimension L can be at least 3mm.<br>
Moving in the direction away from the forward nose 24, subsequent to the converging<br>
surfaces 22a and 22b is an area of reduced width or a waisted section 25. The waisted<br>
section is defined by a first pair of angled surfaces 26a and 26b, as well as a second set of<br>
surfaces 28a and 28b. Surfaces 26a and 28a, as well as 26b and 28b meet at the area of<br><br><br>
reduced width and define a trough-like formation. The cutting tip may also comprise a<br>
planar rear surface 29.<br>
Numerous modifications to the above-described geometry are contemplated, so long as the<br>
insert geometry provides a self-locating, self-retention property when placed in a cutting<br>
insert body.<br>
Figure 4 is illustrative of three alternative cutting tip configurations: 20a, 20b and 20c.<br>
These cutting tip configurations differ with respect to the amount of superhard material<br>
contained therein, and consequently the leg length (L) thereof. The amount of superhard<br>
material contained in the cutting tip 20 can be varied by choosing the location of the<br>
cutting lines 18 (Figure 2), as well as by the size, configuration and/or depth of the pockets<br>
14 in the blank 10. As illustrated in Figure 4, a cutting tip 20c can be configured such that<br>
it is formed entirely from superhard cutting material, or a cutting tip 20a can be configured<br>
such that the superhard material in a relatively minor component thereof.<br>
The above-described-cutting tips of the present invention are affixed to the-w body of an<br>
cutting insert. One illustrative example of an appropriate cutting insert body is shown in<br>
Figure 5. The illustrated cutting insert body 30 comprises a body 32 of hard material<br>
provided with a suitable number of cavities 34,35 for receiving cutting tips 20. The<br>
cavities 34,35 are preferably provided with a shape or geometry that is complimentary to<br>
the shape or geometry of the cutting tips disposed therein.<br><br><br>
The body 32 is composed of any suitable hard material. Examples of suitable materials<br>
include cemented carbides, cermets, and hard metal alloys. One suitable composition is a<br>
WC-Co cemented carbide having 10-20 weight % Co, and preferably having 15-17 weight<br>
% Co.<br>
Numerous modifications to the illustrated example are contemplated. For example, the<br>
illustrated blank 30 is generally in the shape of a polygon or a diamond and is configured<br>
to receive two identical cutting tips. However, the shape of the body can be other<br>
polygonal shapes, an oval, or circular. The central through hole 36, which can be used for<br>
a particular type of mounting, can be omitted. The body 30 can be configured to receive<br>
more than two tips. For example, up to four tips can be provided at each corner. It is not<br>
necessary that the tips disposed in the body 30 be identical to one another. The cutting tips<br>
and/or the body 30 may be machined, prior to, and/or, subsequent to installation of the<br>
cutting tips. The cutting insert body 30 and/or the cutting tip (s) 20 may be provided with<br>
one or more coating (s). Further, the body 30 may be provided with a "chip-breaker"<br>
configuration, such as described in U. S. Patent No. 5,569, 000, the disclosure of which in<br>
incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br>
Figure 6 is an illustrative indexable cutting insert 60 comprising a cutting insert body 32<br>
having cutting tips 20 retained thereby. The cutting tips 20 can be affixed to the body 32<br>
by any suitable technique. Suitable techniques include soldering or brazing. One such<br>
technique is described in U. S. Patent No. 5,183, 362, the disclosure of which is<br><br><br>
incorporated herein, by reference, in its entirety. In the illustrated embodiment, the cutting<br>
tips are affixed to the body 32 by a braze joint 40.<br>
Figure 7 is another illustrative embodiment of an indexable cutting insert 70 formed<br>
according to the principles of the present invention. The cutting insert 70 has cutting tips<br>
20c configured as described in connection with Figure 4.<br>
Figure 8 is an image comparing a cutting insert 300 formed according to the present<br>
invention, with a conventionally formed cutting insert 1000. As illustrated in Figure 8, the<br>
leg length of the superhard material of the cutting insert 300 of the present invention is<br>
significantly greater than the leg length of the superhard material of the conventional<br>
cutting insert formed by conventional techniques thereby providing the possibility of<br>
increased useful service life of the cutting tip.<br>
The present invention and the above-described embodiments thereof provide numerous<br>
advantages over conventional cutting inserts and their methods of fabrication.<br>
By forming a blank having a relatively large number of pockets of superhard material, a<br>
relatively large number of cutting tips can be produced by each costly and difficult<br>
pressing/sintering process cycle, thereby providing an advantage in terms of economy. By<br>
removing the tips from the blank and affixing them to the body of a cutting insert, the each<br>
cutting insert can have a number of tips that is less that the number removed from the<br>
blank. Thus, cutting inserts having a relatively few number of cutting tips, for example 2-4<br><br>
tips, can be manufactured provided to meet the demands of the market, but retain the<br>
advantage of being made in an economical manner. The manufacturing costs of producing<br>
these indexable cutting inserts according to the method of the present invention can be on<br>
the order of 50-60 % less than the costs of producing inserts according to the second<br>
technique described in the Background of the Invention section herein.<br>
The technique of the present invention also provides the advantage of having an increased<br>
yield when compared to techniques such as the second technique described in the<br>
Background of the Invention section. When utilizing the technique of the present<br>
invention, one defective superhard material pocket may result in one cutting tip being<br>
scrapped. By comparison, a single defective superhard material pocket in the second<br>
conventional technique described herein can result in the entire cutting insert being<br>
scrapped.<br>
According to the present invention, the cutting tips are provided with a geometry that<br>
positively locates the tip within the body of the cutting insert upon assembly, thus<br>
eliminating the need for complicated fixtures to hold the insert in place during brazing. In<br>
addition, the geometry of the cutting tip provides for mechanical retention within the body<br>
of the cutting insert. Therefore, even if the braze joint fails, totally or in part, the cutting<br>
insert may still be retained by the above-described mechanical retention feature.<br>
A cutting tip formed according to the principles of the present invention also facilitates the<br>
formation of a cutting tip wherein the superhard material has a leg length that is greater<br><br>
than that readily attainable by conventional techniques (e. g. 2-3 mm or more). Increased<br>
leg length provides more superhard material available for machining the workpiece,<br>
thereby adding length to the useful service life of the cutting tip. Moreover, the superhard<br>
material of the cutting tip of the present invention extends from the top surface thereof to<br>
the bottom surface, thereby providing a first cutting edge surface on the top, and a second<br>
cutting edge surface on the bottom of the cutting tip that can be accessed by flipping the<br>
cutting insert over.<br>
Additional advantages will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The described embodiments of the present invention are intended to be illustrative rather<br>
than restrictive, and are not intended to represent every possible embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Various modifications can be made to the disclosed embodiments<br>
