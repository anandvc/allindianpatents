This invention relates to improvements in or relating to bicycle frames.<br>
The existing bicycle frames are made of circular section tubes of varying diameters and thicknesses with brazed or welded joints.  Generally, all bicycle frames for adult usage have a diamond configuration for the front and a triangular configuration for the rear.  These known bicycle frames have many inherent drawbacks.  For instance, the chain cannot be easily removed without delinking, because of the rear triangular configuration of the frame.  Due to this problem, chain removal is laborious and time consuming, and moreover skilled persons are required for servicing and maintenance jobs.  Further, due to the front diamond configuration of the frame, the brake cable routing for the rear brake undergoes two bending, and this causes more friction for movement of the cable, thereby reducing the braking efficiency and necessitating more force to be applied on the brake lever.  Furthermore, as the top tube is connecting the top ends of the head tube and the seat tube, the height of the top tube from the ground is more and, therefore, it is often felt inconvenient, especially for ladies, in regular use.<br>
An object of the present invention is to avoid or at least minimise the abovementioned drawbacks.  Another object of the present invention is to provide a better aesthetic appearance<br><br>
and  to  impart more   rigidity to the cycle  frame  on  vertical loading.<br>
With  these   and  other objects   in view,   the present  invention provides   a bicycle  frame,   comprising a main  tube assembly with an  oval  cross-section  and having  a  tuning  fork   like configuration,   the  end--of  each tine member of  said  tube assembly being provided with  a drop-out  for mounting  the  rear wheel assembly and  the  other end  thereof being provided  with  a head tube  for mounting  the  front wheel  assembly,   a  substantially vertical  seat tube  fixed  centrally at the U-turn  of said  main tube  assembly,   the bottom end of  said  seat   tube being provided with  a  bracket  for mounting  the  chain wheel  and crank  assembly and  the  top end  thereof being provided with  a clamp for mounting  the   saddle,   a pair of   support  tubes,   one  connecting  the top end   and  the  other connecting  the bottom end  of  said  seat tube with  the  stem of said main  tube assembly,   and a pair of seat  stay  tubes  connecting  the  top end  of  said  seat tube  with the   two  tine  members   of  said main tube   assembly.<br>
The   invention will now be  described,     by way of illustration only,   with  reference  to the   accompanying drawing,   in which :-<br>
Fig.   1   shows   a  bicycle   frame  assembly  according to an embodiment  of  the present   invention;   and<br>
Fig.   2   shows  a bicycle  fitted with  the  frame  assembly shown in Fig.   1.<br><br>
As shown in the Figures the frame assembly consists of a main tube 1 and two rear stay tubes 2 and 3 welded together to form a tuning fork like configuration.  The tubes 1, 2 and 3 are made from circular cross-section tubes of required dimensions which are then pressed in a power press using die blocks to impart the required oval shape to them.  A head tube 4 is fixed at the front (free) end of tube 1 by welding.  A seat tube 5 is fixed centrally and in between the rear stays 2 and 3 by welding.  A bottom bracket tube 6 is fixed at the bottom end of seat tube 5 by welding. There is a top support tube 7, one end of which is fixed to the top portion of seat tube 5 and the other end thereof is fixed to the rear portion of main tube 1 by welding.  There is a bottom support tube 8, one end of which is fixed to the bottom bracket 6 and the other end thereof is fixed to the rear portion of tube 1 by welding.  Seat stay tubes 9 and 10 are fixed to the top portion of seat tube 5 and to the middle portions of the rear stay tubes 2 and 3 by welding.  The free (rear) ends of the rear stay tubes 2 and 3 are provided with drop-outs 11 and 12 by welding for rear wheel mounting. Pivot pins 13 and 14 are welded vertically on rear stays 2 and 3 at suitable locations for rear brake mounting.  A bridge plate 15 is welded across the seat stays 9 and 10 and another bridge plate 16 (see Fig. 2) is welded across rear stays 2 and 3 for rear mudguard mounting purpose.  A clamp 17 is welded on the top end of the seat tube 5 to enable mounting of the saddle. Cable guides 18 and 19 are welded on top edges of tube 1 in-line, one on each end of the tube 1, through which the rear brake cable<br><br>
is guided.  A cable stopper 20 is welded on the rear side of seat tube 5 and at a location above rear stay tubes 2 and 3, to hold the rear brake cable sleeve while fixing the brake assembly.<br>
In the frame assembly shown, the rear stays 2 and 3 are connected to almost the centre portion of the seat tube 5 leaving free space -along the chain path, and this facilitates easy removal of the chain, when required, without delinking.<br>
The main tube 1 and the rear stays 2 and 3 are aligned in a straight line thereby facilitating a straight path for the rear brake cable.  This avoids one of the two bends existing in the rear brake cable mounting in the case of conventional frame assembly.  Thus, the present invention reduces the brake cable operating friction, thereby enhancing the braking efficiency and reducing the force requirement on the brake lever.<br>
The present invention also eliminates the top tube existing in the conventional frames that connects the top ends of the seat tube and head tube, and because of this, elimination more leg space is created.  Moreover, the operating height of the main tube from the ground is also reduced.  All these enable easy getting on and getting down from the bicycle and make the riding more convenient for both the sexes.<br>
In the frame assembly according to the invention, since the main tube 1 and the rear stays 2 and 3 are of oval cross-section, the frame can sustain more vertical loading.  Moreover, the frame<br><br>
r<br>
configuration imparts a unique appearance to the bicycle contributed by the proper positioning of main tube 1, rear stay tubes 2 and 3, top support tube 1,   and the bottom support tube 8.<br><br><br>
