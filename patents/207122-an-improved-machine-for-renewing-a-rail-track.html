				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved machine for renewing a rail track on a ballast bed, comprising a machine frame supportable on rail undercarriages, with which are associated two sleeper transporting devices, distanced from one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine, for picking up old sleepers and laying down new sleepers, respectively, a caterpillar-tracked undercarriage and a ballast grading device being arranged between the sleeper transporting devices.<br>
A machine of this kind is already known from EP 0621371 Bl. This machine may be employed for track construction operations in both directions of travel, where in the one direction an old railway track is renewed while in the opposite working direction a track is newly laid upon a prepared formation. During the track renewal, the machine travels in the construction gap by means of the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage on a formation surface which - after removal of the old rails and sleepers - was created by clearing away the old ballast by means of the ballast grading device preceding in the working direction. Behind the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage, the new sleepers are laid down and the new rails are spread. For laying the new track, the machine must be converted by now mounting the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage on the machine frame in front of - with regard to the new operating direction - the device for laying down the new sleepers. In addition to repositioning the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage, the sleeper elevator of the new-sleeper laying device is turned around, while the device for picking up the old sleepers and the ballast grading device are taken out of<br>
2<br><br>
operation by being vertically adjusted.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to create a machine of the above named kind for renewing a track, in which the working direction can be reversed with a minimum of conversion operations.<br>
This object is achieved with a machine of the specified kind in that the grading device is designed to be rotatable about a vertical axis over an angle of 180 deg.<br>
With a machine designed in such a way, it is now possible during working operations to renew tracks to reverse the working direction practically without essential conversion work on the machine. This can, for example, be of great advantage if perhaps a double track has to be renewed. In this case, the machine, after renewing one strand of rails, can work back in the opposite direction on the other strand without the entire machine installation having to be turned around in a laborious and complicated or time-consuming manner. In addition, it is advantageous from the viewpoint of logistics to be able to approach the track, construction site from either side, as the case may be, or to be able to start work without particularly having to take into consideration the orientation of the machine. To do so, the grading device can be pivoted into the respective working direction and brought into the operating position simply, quickly and without problems.<br>
3<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided :<br>
An improved machine for renewing a rail track on a ballast bed, comprising :<br>
(a)	a machine frame extending in a longitudinal direction,<br>
(b)	undercarriages for supporting the machine frame on the rail<br>
track,<br>
(c)	a first sleeper transporting device for receiving old<br>
sleepers and a second sleeper transporting device for laying down<br>
new sleepers, the sleeper transporting devices being mounted on<br>
the machine frame and being spaced from each other in the<br>
longitudinal direction, and<br>
{d) a caterpillar-tracked undercarriage and a ballast grading device arranged on the machine frame between the sleeper transport devices, characterised in that<br>
the ballast grading device being rotatable by 180 deg. about a vertical axis.<br>
The invention is now described in details with reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Fig.l and 2 show respective, highly schematized side views of a track renewal machine adapted in each case for working in the opposite direction,<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a side view of sleeper conveying- or -loading wagons coupled to the machine,<br>
Fig. 4 and 5 each show a detailed side view of the region of the grading device of the machine, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a sectional view according to section line VI in Fig. 4.<br>
In Fig. 1, a machine 1 can be seen which is designed for renewing a track 2 in a working direction indicated by an arrow 3. The machine 1 comprises a machine frame 5, supportable on rail undercarriages 4, at the end of which a driver's or operator's cab 6 is arranged. At its other end positioned opposite thereto, the machine frame 5 is supported in a universally articulated manner by means of a joint 7 on a wagon frame 8 of a sleeper conveying wagon 9 which is mobile on the track by way of rail undercarriages 10. Attached to the sleeper conveying wagon - as shown in Fig. 3 - is a power car 11 for supplying energy to the machine 1, and a number of sleeper loading wagons 12. A gantry crane 15 is designed for mobility on running rails 14 along the said wagons 9, 11 and 12 all the way to the region of the machine frame 5 adjoining the joint 7.<br>
In the area of a construction gap 16, the machine frame 5 is supported during working operations on an exposed formation 18, or immobile thereon, by means of a vertically adjustable caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 17. Located in front of and behind the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 17 are working units in the shape of two sleeper transporting devices 19 and 21, spaced from one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine, for picking up old sleepers 20 or laying down new sleepers 22, as well as a ballast grading device 23 arranged therebetween, all of which will be explained in yet more detail with reference to Fig. 4 (or 5).<br>
Fig. 2 shows the same machine as Fig. 1, adapted however for operation in the opposite working direction according to arrow 13. As will be described at a later point with reference to Fig. 5, the sleeper transporting device 19 now serves to<br>
5"<br><br>
lay down new sleepers 22 while the sleeper transporting device 21 is employed for picking up old sleepers 20. The ballast grading device 23, rotatable over an angle of 180°, is now oriented in a new working position according to arrow 13.<br>
As becomes clear from Fig. 4, the ballast grading device 23, rotatable with the aid of a drive 48 about a vertical axis 29, is designed as an endless clearing chain 26 which is rotatable by means of a drive 28 in a plane 27 inclined to the track 2 and which is vertically adjustable by means of a further drive 30. Associated with the clearing chain 26 in a ballast discharge area 32 distanced from the track 2 in the vertical direction is a transverse conveyor belt 31 which extends perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the track and conveys ballast taken up by the clearing chain 26 towards the track shoulder (see Fig. 6). A second transverse conveyor belt 33 is arranged immediately behind the transverse conveyor belt 31, in the longitudinal direction of the track, at a slightly higher position and is intended for discharging ballast onto the opposite track shoulder. The two transverse conveyor belts 31 and 33 are arranged staggered with regard to the transverse direction of the machine, so that a respective ballast receiving end 34 or 35 located centrally of the track is positioned underneath the ballast discharge area 32 of the clearing chain 26. The two transverse conveyor belts 31 and 33 are arranged on a common support frame 36 and, with the aid of the same, are mounted, by way of a parallelogram linkage 37 connected to the grading device 23, on the grading device for vertical adjustment about axes 38 extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the machine.<br>
For working operations as represented in Fig. 4, the machine 1 is brought into position in the construction gap 16 v/ith the aid of a vertically adjustable auxiliary undercarriage 39 and supported on the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 17. While the machine advances in the direction of the arrow 3, the old rails 40 of the track 2 are lifted from the old sleepers 20 and removed by means of suitable rail guiding devices 41 (Fig. 1). Thereafter, the old sleepers 20 are picked up from the ballast bed 43 of the track 2 in the region<br><br>
of an operator's cab 42 by means of the sleeper transporting device 19 and transported forward in the working direction via the sleeper conveying wagon 9 (Fig. 3) where they are collected into a layer. This layer of old sleepers 20 is. then brought, by means of the gantry crane 15, to the sleeper loading wagons 12 to be transported away.<br>
Subsequently, the surface of the ballast bed 43 is milled off by the ballast grading device 23, or rather the clearing chain 26, in order to produce the formation 18, and the ballast removed in this way is discharged by the transverse conveyor belts 31 or 33 towards ,the shoulders of the track.2 (Fig. 6). By pivoting the transverse conveyor belts 31,33 about the axes 38 with the aid of the parallelogram linkage 37, it is possible to choose which of the two transverse conveyor belts 31 or 33 is positioned with its ballast receiving end 34 or 35 in the discharge area 32 of the clearing chain 26, i.e. towards which track side the taken-up ballast will be discharged.<br>
The vertically adjustable caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 17 following in the working direction (arrow 3) rolls on the newly-created formation 18, causing the latter to be consolidated at the same time. Fastened to the sides of the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 17 are vertical shields 44 which are pivotable about a vertical axis 45 and prevent the ballast laterally discharged by the transverse conveyor belt 31 or 33 from flowing back onto the formation 18 (see Fig. 6) before the new sleepers 22 have been laid down by the sleeper transporting device 21 following in the longitudinal direction of the track. The spreading of new rails onto the new sleepers 22 is carried out thereafter by means of additional machines which are not shown.<br>
For working operations according to the situation represented in Fig. 5, in the direction of the arrow 13, the ballast grading device 23 (including the transverse conveyor belts 31 and 33 supported thereon) has to be rotated about the vertical axis 29 over an angle of 180°. The sleeper transporting device 21, now in front, is now used for picking up old sleepers 20 of the track 2, and for this purpose, a sleeper fork 46 is mounted in this position. The<br><br>
caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 17 following in the longitudinal direction of the track or working direction  now rolls on the ballast bed 43, cleared from the old sleepers 20, which is graded by the trailing clearing chain 26. The formation 18 newly created in this manner is compacted, before the laying of the new sleepers 22 with the aid of the sleeper transporting device 19, by means of a vertically adjustable consolidating device 47 mounted thereon. (Said consolidating device 47 is shown in Fig. 4 pivoted upwards into the inoperative position). The shields 44 are now likewise mounted on the sleeper transporting device 19. The transporting-away and delivery of the old or new sleepers 20,22, respectively, is carried out analogously to the already described variant according to Fig. 4 (or Fig. 1 and 3) with the aid of the gantry crane 15.<br>
Instead of a clearing chain, the ballast grading device 23 could also be designed, for example, as a V-shaped ballast plough (not separately shown).<br>
