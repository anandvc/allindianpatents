				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchlorides, useful intermediates in electronic industry and<br>
dye industry. This research pertains to a method of preparation of<br>
diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchlorides having formula 1-3 from corresponding<br>
diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its sodium salt, using diphosgene or triphosgene<br>
Our interest in preparing these diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchlorides is to convert them<br>
in making various esters and which can be used in formulating the photoresists required<br>
for electronics industry.<br>
There are a few methods of preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchlorides<br>
reported in the literature and the same reports will be discussed below with merits and<br>
demerits.<br>
The methods reported in prior art on the preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonyl<br>
chlorides involves using chlorosulfonic acid and the corresponding diazonaphthoquinone<br>
sulfonic acid or its salt (CA, vol. 124, 32490e, PL 161,627, year 1993; CA vol. 64, 2033,<br>
USSR 173,756, year 1965; J.Prak.Chem., year 1991, vol. 333, p467). The main<br>
disadvantages of this method involves in using excess chlorosulfonic acid, reaction<br>
temperature and the evolution of gases like sulfurdioxide and hydrogenchloride.<br>
Another method involves use of thionylchloride with dimethylformamide as<br>
catalyst with the corresponding diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its salt. This method<br>
also suffers the disadvantages like heating the reaction mixture, use of excess<br>
thionylchloride and evolution of sulfurdioxide and hydrogenchloride gases (CA, vol. 96,<br>
34766b, Khim. Process, year 1981, p505 (Russ)).<br>
Another method involves use of chlorosulfonic acid in combination with<br>
thionylchloride along with the corresponding diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its<br>
salt. The main disadvantages are the same as mentioned above (CA, vol. 105, 208620w,<br>
Ger (East) 272,511, year 1985 and DD 234, 000, year 1986; CA vol. 112, 178384x, Ger<br>
(East) DD 269,846, year 1989, Ger (East) 312,180, year 1988; CA, vol. 124, 302642u, JP<br>
08,27,098, year 1996; CA, vol. 125, 170873d, RO 104,624, year 1994).<br>
Yet another method involves is the use of phosgene (toxic gas) with the<br>
corresponding diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid or its salt. This method has the<br>
optimum temperature conditions but the greatest disadvantage is the use of toxic<br>
phosgene gas (CA, vol. 102, 113031d, JP 59,196,860, year 1984; CA, vol. 105, 60439w,<br>
EP 178,356, year 1986).<br>
The present invention describes an altogether new process for the preparation of<br>
diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchlorides by reacting the corresponding<br>
diazonaphthoquinone sulfonic acid or its salt either with diphosgene or triphosgene in<br>
presence of triethylamine base in dichloromethane solvent. Various solvents like,<br>
chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, benzonitrile, nitrobenzene<br>
and others are also used. Organic bases like tributylamine, pyridine, tripropylamine, N,Ndimethylaniline,<br>
N,N-diethylamine and other bases are also employed. Dichloromethane<br>
as solvent and triethylamine as organic base were preferred. The temperature of the<br>
reaction was varied over -50 to +5°C and -40°C is the preferred temperature condition.<br>
The base is found to be essential for the reaction to be conducted and without the organic<br>
base there is no reaction occurs. The 2 mole equivalent ratio of base is the right<br>
combination found. The work up procedure and isolation of the product<br>
diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchloride is very simple and rapid. After the reaction the<br>
organic base and the solvent can be recovered. After the isolation of the product, the<br>
remaining filtrate contains the unreacted diazonaphthoquinonesulfonic acid as judged by<br>
the UV-Visible absorption data. The products were characterized by the spectral data.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of diazonaphthoquinonesulfonylchlorides of formula 1a, 1b, 1c using diphosgene or triphosgene which comprises:<br>
