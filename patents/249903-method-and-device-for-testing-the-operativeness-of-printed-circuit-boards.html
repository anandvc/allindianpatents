				<td>Process and Device for Testing Circuit Boards for Serviceability<br>
This invention relates to a process for testing circuit boards for serviceability and a device for carrying out the process.<br>
To test for serviceability of circuit boards, i.e. test for current flow within conductor paths both on one side of the circuit board and also from one side to the other, the expression "bareboard test system" discloses a process in which testing for electrical permeability of conductor paths takes place by elastic contact pins that are attached to both sides of the circuit board in a die and are configured in their arrangement according to the contact points.<br>
In order to ensure reliable contact of the contact pins with the corresponding contact points, the dies are moved with a certain pressure against the circuit board, and the forces resulting from the springs of the contact pin must be overcome. For the host of contact pins that are conventionally used, considerable pressures that dictate a corresponding mechanical concept are necessary.<br>
The equipment costs that must be borne here lead to considerable production costs of one such machine, another disadvantage being relatively great fault susceptibility that is caused especially by the large number of contact pins used, which can be in the range of 10,000 pieces.<br>
The possible density of contact points that increases with newer technologies limits the use of contact pins so that the attainable resolution for making contact with circuit boards no longer keeps up with modern requirements.<br>
Another process is known under the term "flying probetester". Here, 2 to 8 test needles at a time are positioned on the two sides of the circuit board by suitable movement units over the contact points of the circuit board for which the electrical permeability is to be determined. Contact-making between the test needles and the selected contact point on the circuit board takes place by lowering the test needles onto this point. The current proceeding from the first test needle is routed to the circuit board contact, and on the other end of the conductor path, it is likewise received and measured by one such test needle. In principle, it is testing by contact here, one test needle being assigned to each contact site of the conductor path not according to the described contact pins, but their being moved accordingly, computer-controlled. Here, there is the danger of damage of the contact points by multiple contact, with the consequence that problems in the component placement on the circuit board can occur.<br>
In order to avoid this damage, attempts have already been made to replace the test needles by a conductive plasma by which contact with the contact points is established.<br>
The disadvantage here, however, is that the speed within which the circuit board can be completely tested is relatively low, in particular based on the working steps: paired positioning of the test needles, lowering, measuring and moving to the next positions. These test systems rather quickly reach their resolution limits, i.e., operating limits, due to the size of the test needles and the only limited possible accuracy of the movement units.<br>
Finally, US 5 177 437 describes testing of circuit boards in which a matrix that can be photoelectrically activated by means of a light source is applied to the glass plate. Between the matrix and the circuit board, there is an electrically conductive mat. In any case, the construction<br>
cost for executing this process is relatively high. In addition, the interconnected mat and the matrix that is rigid compared to the circuit board cannot equalize or take into account production-induced unevenness and inaccuracies of the surface of the circuit board, such that an absolutely accurate test result is not guaranteed.<br>
For operation, moreover, there are "light valves" designated as such, by which the emitted light beam of a continuous light source is masked and unmasked according to requirements. The construction cost here is extremely high and in addition to high production costs, it leads to fault susceptibility that prevents optimum operation.<br>
Therefore, the object of this invention is to develop a process of the generic type such that it can be carried out with low equipment costs and high speed, higher test accuracy is achieved, and extremely small contact points of the circuit board can be tested.<br>
This object is achieved by a process that has the features of claim 1.<br>
The process according to the invention now enables testing that is extremely effective with respect to the working speed and that is nondestructive at the same time with respect to the circuit board.<br>
Direct application of a flexible layer to at least one side of the circuit board, i.e., direct contact-making, on the one hand makes the structural cost much lower than in the known processes, and, on the other hand, ensures that production-induced unevenness of the circuit board is also taken into account. The layer that is initially impermeable to current rests directly on each point ofthe circuit board based on its flexible composition, so that almost no test inaccuracies arise. The quality of the test result is thus much improved. This is therefore<br>
especially noteworthy when these circuit boards are used in large numbers, and therefore the highest possible quality assurance, which includes optimum testing, is what is important.<br>
Current passage can be produced by a laser beam that proceeds from a static source. The benrn is deflected by tiny and extremely light mirrors, so that in the positioning of the beam, only a small mass need be moved into the area of contact of the conductor path to be tested; as mentioned, the process can be carried out much more quickly than is possible in the described prior art.<br>
As the layers that can be applied to the two sides of the circuit board, they can be applied from a plasma that fills a space that is bordered on one side by the circuit board and that is otherwise sealed to such an extent that this plasma cannot flow in.<br>
Here, the plasma has the advantage that it is ionized solely in the area produced by the laser beam, and it becomes electrically conductive.<br>
To determine the permeability of a conductor path that is located on one side of the circuit board, a partitioned layer can be applied that represents a current conductor and that is made altematingly in the partitions such that in conjunction with the conductor path that is under the plasma layer when serviceability is perfect, a circuit is formed that can be determined by means of a connected measurement device.<br>
According to another idea of the invention, it is provided that on one side of the circuit board a film be placed that represents an equivalent to the indicated plasma layer and on which a partitioned layer is also placed comparably thereto. This layer can be photoconductive and can consist of, for example, organic semiconductors (special polymers).<br>
By applying film to the two sides of the circuit board, the permeability of the conductor paths that are routed through the circuit board and that have contact points on each side can be tested. Here, partitioning of the films can be abandoned since the latter jointly form a circuit in which the measurement device is located at a suitable location. In order to be able to check a conductor path provided on one side with strip conductors in this arrangement, a partitioned film is feasibly used.<br>
A suitable film is a so-called polymer film that becomes conductive in the area irradiated by the laser beam, but impermeable to current again in this area directly after the laser beam is turned off.<br>
This makes it possible to position the laser beam in a very short time sequence at the most varied points so that current can flow through the individual contact points of the circuit board without difficulty. In the case in which this contact point is faulty, i.e., no current is flowing, this is indicated by the measurement technology that is integrated into the circuit.<br>
It can be established at any time, for example by keeping a record, at which contact position the circuit board is faulty.<br>
Other advantageous further developments of the invention are identified in the subclaims.<br>
described below using the attached drawings.<br>
Here:<br><br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
  Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for testing printed circuit boards for operativeness, characterized in that a flexible layer that is initially impermeable to current and that is made of a photoconductive polymer film is placed directly on at least one side of the circuit board making contact, and it is dynamically connected to a current conductor the layer  is then energized, and then a current passage is partially created at the contact points that delimit a respective conductor path to be tested, and then the current flow in the conductor path is measured via the current conductor whereby the current passage is produced by a laser beam that penetrates the layer  in the area of the position of the conductor path Brief description of the accompanying drawings: The process according to the invention and a device for carrying out the processa re<br>
    described below using the attached drawings:<br>
     Here:<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a device for carrying out the process in a schematic side<br>
view, <br>
Furthermor, the present invention also relates to a divice for implementing the process<br>
 as claimed in claim i said device  <br>
Figure 2	shows another embodiment of one such device likewise in a schematic<br>
side view,<br>
Figure 3	shows a schematic overhead view of the device according to Figure 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device with which circuit boards 1 can be tested for serviceability.<br>
In doing so, current passage through a conductor path 5 that is routed transversely through the circuit board 1 is determined so that on both sides of the circuit board 1, there are contact points that border the conductor path 5.<br>
On the opposing sides of the circuit board 1, one flexible layer 2 that is initially impermeable to current in the form of a polymer film is applied at a time, making contact, of which each is connected to one of the two poles of a voltage source.<br>
Between the transparent layers 2 and the contact points to be tested on the circuit board 1, an electrical field is built up by the applied voltage.<br>
On both sides, there is a transmitter 4 with which a laser beam is produced and preferably deflected and which penetrates the respectively assigned layer 2 in an area of its beam diameter.<br>
In this area, the layer 2 is then permeable to current so that in the case in which the conductor path 5 is not damaged, the circuit is closed.<br>
A measurement-source device 6 is located between the two layers, connecting them, in order, on the one hand, to apply a voltage difference, and, on the other hand, to ascertain whether current is flowing through the conductor path 5 or not.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show a device with which a conductor path 5 that is provided only on one side of the circuit board 1 is tested for permeability.<br>
At least in the test area, a current conductor 3 in the form of a layer is applied to the layer 2, preferably making contact as a superficial, transparent electrode, which enables unhindered passage of the laser beam that is shown by the broken line, and that can be made integral with the photoconductive layer 2. In this case, the current conductor 3, i.e., the electrode, forms a carrier layer for the layer 2.<br>
As Figure 3 especially clearly shows, the current conductor 3 is partitioned into fields 7 that are arranged in a checkerboard manner with different poles, a differently polarized field 7 being assigned to each contact area bordering the conductor path 5.<br>
In this way, a conductor circuit is built up to which is connected the measurement-source device 6 by which the permeability of the conductor path 5 can be determined.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
