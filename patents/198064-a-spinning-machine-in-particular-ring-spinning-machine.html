				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br><br>
The invention relates to a spinning machine, in par¬ticular a ring spinning machine in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Rotary change gears and draft change gears are usually attached to spinning machines or doubling frames in form of separate bearings in the frame elements of the machine. Misalignments, distance tolerances of toothed wheels, etc. have to be adjusted with considerable efforts in completely mounted drive-units. A particular disadvantage in this respect is the fact that the required assembly works must be carried out both on the head frame as well as the base frame of the spinning machine.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a spinning machine, in particular a ring spinning machi¬ne, of the type mentioned above, in which the assembly can be made without substantial adjustment works in such a way that misalignments and other tolerances between individual components do not occur. Furthermo¬re, it is intended in the ring spinning machine in accordance with the invention that the exchange of components and the maintenance thereof is facilitated.<br>
The features of the characterizing parts of claim 1 are provided for achieving this object.<br>
The modules in accordance with the invention can be built into the head frames and base frames without any changes, in that they are arranged in a symmetrical manner, namely in particular in long machines where drafting cylinders, which are mutually allocated to one another from the head as well as base frame, extend approximately up to the centre of the machine and end there at a small distance from one another.<br><br>
The above-mentioned deficiencies are eliminated by the use' of modules, in that the individual modules are prefabricated with high precision in suitable works¬hops. By way of favourable divisions it is possible to keep the modules very small with respect to their spatial requirements. The bridging of the modules, in particular by using toothed belts, is unproblematic with respect to tolerances.<br>
The division of the individual drives in modules allows an independent preliminary assembly and individual functional checks. Furthermore, this ensures the quick final assembly of the overall gear units or conveyor units.<br>
Whereas the drafting arrangement drives are present in any case at either end of the machine, i.e. both in the base frame as well as in the head frame, the ring rail drive should favourably only be provided in the head frame pursuant to claim 2.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a spinning machine, in particular a ring spinning machine, comprising at least one, but preferably two rows of rotatably drivable spindles, which rows are opposite of one another and extend in the longitudinal direction, as well as a head frame arranged at the one end of the row(s) and a base frame provided at the other end of the row(s), in each of which are disposed drive motors and transmission gears for the drive of drafting cylinders which are mutually aligned in pairs and extend towards one another in the direction of the row(s) of spindles, characterized in that the drive motors and the transmission gears are housed in modules which are mounted completely in the head and base frame and are provided mutually symmetrically in the head and base frame.<br>
The parent application 518/MAS/93 describes and relates to a ring spinning machine wherein the driving motors and gears are housed in prefabricated modules.<br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail by reference to the enclosed drawings, in which :<br>
FIG. 1	shows  a schematic view of a ring  spinning machine  in<br>
accordance  with  the   invention,  with  the  division  of the individual constructional groups in modules being shown, and<br>
FIG. 2	shows a front view of the ring spinning machine of fig. 1 in the<br>
direction of arrow II in fig. 1<br>
In accordance with fig. 1, the ring spinning machine in accordance with the invention comprises a row of spindles 11 extending in the longitudinal direction<br>
36,	<br><br>
which spindles are rotationally drivable by means of a spindle drive 22 comprising a motor 37.<br>
A liftable and lowerable ring rail 16 is situated near spindles 11. It comprises a pass-through opening 25 for each spindle 11 and carries the traveller ring alloca¬ted to the respective spindle 11.<br>
Thread guide 31 is provided above the spindles, which guide is allocated to each spindle separately.<br>
Ring rail 16 and thread guide 31 can be brought to a suitably controlled lifting or lowering movement through a belt drive 38, 39 by means of a lifting shortening and thread guide lifting apparatus 32 and a ring rail drive 18.<br>
Ring rail drive 18 is provided with a drive motor 40 arranged in a module, which motor can wind up a belt or a rope 42 onto a rope pulley 43 via a suitable gear 41. Belt 42 is guided over two deflection pulleys 45, 46 arranged on a lever 44. Lever 44 is driven to such a pivoting movement about point 4 9 through a cam disc 48, which is driven in a manner over the front cylinder 47 of drafting arrangement 12 which shall be described below, that the ring rail 16 carries out the traversing movement in the vertical direction required for winding up the spun yarn.<br>
During the operation, belt 42 can be pulled in in a step-like manner by a ratchet drive 50 (only shown schematically) instead of motor 40, which drive is driven by cardiodid cam disc 48. This drive is ex¬plained in detail in DE-OS 3 910 182.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the motor 40 used in particular for the start spinning process, the gear 41<br><br>
and the ratchet drive 50 are housed in a separate module 23.<br>
The lifting shortening and thread guide lifting appara¬tus 30, over which belt 42 is guided to the traction ropes 38, 39, is provided in a separate module 30.<br>
The cardiodid cam disc 48 is driven by a pair of too¬thed wheels 53 through a worm 51 and a shaft 52, which pair can be exchanged for determining a suitable win¬ding length. The pair of toothed wheels 53 is driven via a toothed wheel 54 cooperating with a toothed belt. The toothed wheel 54, the pair of toothed wheels 53 as well as the cardiodid cam disc 48 are provided in a separate module 24 in combination with the components allocated thereto.<br>
The toothed belt 27 driving toothed wheel 54 extends from module 24 to a higher arranged module 25 which comprises the drafting arrangement motor 55 as well as the pair of toothed wheels 56 for the change in rotati¬on and a pair of toothed wheels for the rotation stage. The driven toothed wheel of the pair of toothed wheels 57 drives toothed belt 27 via a toothed wheel 58. A further toothed wheel transmission 59 may be provided on the rotation axle of toothed wheel 58 used for the drive of the opposite machines.<br>
Toothed belt 27 extends in the vertical direction up to a further module 26 and is guided there over a driving toothed wheel 61 which drives the forward cylinder 47 of drafting arrangement 12 via a pair of toothed wheels 62. Furthermore, toothed wheel 61 drives a pair of toothed wheels 60 determining the change of draft, which wheels drive at a suitable speed the central and rear cylinder 64 and 65, respectively, of the drafting arrangement 12 via a suitable gear 63. In addition, a<br><br>
traversing apparatus 66 is connected to the drive shaft of the rear cylinder 65.<br>
The components as described above are all contained in the head frame 20 of the ring spinning machine.<br>
Modules 25, 26, however, are also provided symmetrical¬ly in the base frame 21, with the toothed belt 27 ending -on toothed wheel 58, as no ring rail drive 18 is provided in base frame 21.<br>
In accordance with fig. 2, a module 28 is arranged in the middle on a base plate 33, which module comprises a ring rail weight balancing spring arrangement 29. In this way the weight of the ring rail 16 is balanced in a manner not explained herein in closer detail, so that the ring rail drive 18 is relieved of the weight forces of ring rail 16.<br>
On both sides of the module 28, carrier modules 34, 35 are attached to base plate 33 which extend vertically upwardly and receive between one another and next to one another modules 23, 24 which on their part are arranged adjacent to one another.<br>
Module 30 for the lift shortening and thread guide apparatus 32 is provided on modules 33, 23, 24 which are flush at the top.<br>
Modules 25, 26 of the drafting arrangement drive 19 are provided thereon.<br><br><br>
