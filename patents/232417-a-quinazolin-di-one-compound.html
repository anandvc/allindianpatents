				<td>QUINAZOLINE(DI)ONES FOR INVERTEBRATE PEST CONTROL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to certain quinazoline(di)ones. Their V-oxides. agricultural suitable salts and compositions thereof, and a method of use for controlling invertebrate pests in both agronomic and no agronomic environments.<br>
The control of invertebrate pests is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery .crops, stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

In the above recitations., when a compound of Formula I is comprised of one or more heterocyclic rings, all substituents are attached to these rings through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents. Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g. (R)i_j, then the number of substituents may be selected from the .integers between i andj inclusive.<br>
The term "optionally substituted with one to three substituents" and the like indicates that one to three of the available positions on the group can be substituted. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R3 or R8, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstiruted.<br>
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled ia.the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present invention comprises compounds selected from Formula I, TV-oxides and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form TV-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form TV-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form TV-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of TV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and 7?z-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as /-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as drmethydioxirane. These methods for the preparation of TV-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. GRc^im'ComprehemiveVrganicâ€¢'Synthesis, vol: Pergamon Press; M. Tisler andB. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, pp 18-20. A. I Boulton and A. McKillop. Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimmett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistty, vol. 43, pp 149-161, A R. Katiitzky,<br>

Werstiuk ^Advances in Heterocydic Chemistry, vol. 22, pp 390-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press.<br>
The salts of the compounds of the invention include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids. The salts of the compounds of the invention also include those formed with organic bases (e.g., pyridine, ammonia,, or triethylamine) or inorganic bases (e.g., hydrides, hydroxides, or carbonates of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium or barium) when the compound contains an acidic group such as a carboxylic acid or phenol.<br>
As noted above, J is a phenyl ring, a naphthyl ring system, a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring system wherein each ring or ring system is optionally substituted with 1 to 4 substituents independently selected from R5. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these J groups refers to groups which are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the biological activity poss essed by the unsubstituted . analog. An example of phenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5 is the ring illustrated as U-1 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R5 and r is an integer from 0 to 4. An example of a naphthyl group optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5 is illustrated as U-85 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R5 andr is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5 include the rings U-2 through U-53 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is R5 and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Note that J-l through J-13 below also denote 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings. Note that U-2 through U-20 are examples of J-l, U-21 through U-35 and U-40 are examples of J-2, U-36 through U-39 are examples of J-3, U-41 through U-48 are examples of J-4 and U-49 through U-53 are examples of J-5. Note that U-11 is equivalent to J-6, U-26 is equivalent to J-7 or J-10, U-42 is equivalent to J-8, U-45 is equivalent to J-9, U-4 is equivalent to J-l 1 and U-24 is equivalent to J-12 or J-13. Also note that in J-6 through J-13 that R7 and R9 are subsets of R5 of Formula I. Examples of aromatic .8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with 1 to 4 substituents independently selected from R5 include U-54 through U-84 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is R5 of Formula I and r is an integer from 0 to 4.<br>
Rv is attached to these rings "through any available carbon or mtrogen~by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen Note that some U groups can only be substituted with less than 4 Rv groups (e.g. U-16 through U-21 and U-32 through U-34 can only be substituted with one R^7)- Note that when the attachment point between (R^ and the U<br>

This invention also pertains to a method for controlling an invertebrate pest comprising contacting the invertebrate pest or its environment with a biologically effective amount of a<br>
compound of Formula I (e.g., as a composition described herein). This invention also relates to such a method wherein the invertebrate pest or its environment is contacted with a biologically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a composition comprising a compound of Formula I and a biologically effective amount of at least one additional compound or agent for controlling invertebrate pests. The preferred methods of use are those involving the above preferred compounds.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the following methods and variations as described in Schemes 1-1. The definitions of A, B, J, K, L, R3, R4, R5 and n in the compounds of Formulae I and 2-23 below are as defined above in the Summary of .the Invention. Compounds of Formulae la-Ic, If, 2a-c, 9a-i and lOa-c are various subsets of the compounds of Formula I, 2, 9 and 10, respectively and all substituents for Formulae la-If are as defined above for Formula I.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds of Formula I can be prepared by the reaction of aryl or heteroaryl amines of Formula 2 with, acid chlorides of Formula 3 in the presence of a base to provide a compound of Formula la. The reaction can be run neat or in a variety of suitable solvents including tetrahydrofuran, toluene, methylene-chloride and chloroform with, optimum temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Typical bases used in the reaction include amines such as triethylamine and pyridine. carbonates^ such as potassium and sodium carbonate and hydrides such as â€¢potassium and sodium hydride. In a subsequent step, compounds of Formula la can be converted to 'compounds of Formula Tb using a variety of standard thio transfer reagents including phosphorus pentasulfide and (2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-l,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphe-tane-234-disulfide).<br>

CO) or a derivative of Formula 2b (wherein L is Ci-C3 alkyl optionally substituted with one to three substituents independently selected from R13), with an acid chloride of Formula 3<br>
provides a compound of Formula Ic. These procedures can also be applied to prepare compounds of Formula I wherein K is selected from K-2 through K-6.<br>
As shown in Scheme 33 compounds Formula 2a can be prepared in two steps from known isatoic anhydrides. In the first step an isatoic anhydride of Formula 4 is reacted directly with an amine of Formula 5. either neat or in a suitable solvent to afford an amide of Formula 6. Treatment of the amide of Formula 6 with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent affords the quinazolinedione of Formula 2 a.<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, compounds of Formula 2b, wherein Rx and Ry are independently H and subsets of R13, can be prepared from compounds of Formula 6 by reaction with an aldehyde or ketone generally in the presence of an acid catalyst such as p-toluehesulfomc aci d"(pTSA}.   Azeoiropic removal of thewafer as it is formed, or other methods of drying, can be useful in driving the reaction to completion.<br><br><br>
Rx and Ry are each independently H, alkyl or aiyl<br>
As shown in Scheme 5, compounds of Formula 2c can be prepared by the Schmidt reaction from tetrahydroquinolinones of Formula 8 and sodium azide (/. Het. Chem. 1971, 8, 231-236). Reaction of a compound of Formula 2c with an acid chloride 3 in the presence of a base such as rriethylamme affords a product of Formula If.<br><br><br><br>
Acid chlorides of Formula 3 are well documented in the chemical literature and generally derived from the corresponding known aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids of Formula 9., Many of the carboxylic acids of Formula 9 are known in the literature. Procedures for the preparation of specific preferred acids of Formula 9a-9f and their derived acid chlorides are described in WO 01/70671 <br><br><br><br>
The pyridylpyrazole carboxylic acids of Formula 9g-9i are a specifically preferred set of acids of Formula 9 (Scheme 7). Reaction of apyrazole of Formula 10 with 2,3-dichloropyridine of Formula 11 affords good yields of the 1-pyridylpyrazole of Formula 12 with good specificity for the desired regiochemistry. Metallation of compounds of Formula 12 with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) followed by quenching of the lithium salt with carbon dioxide affords the pyrazole acids of Formula 9g-9L Additional details for the synthesis of Formula 9i are provided in Example 1-.<br><br>
The starting pyrazoles of Formula 10 are kaown compounds or can be prepared according to known methods. Pyrazole lOa can be prepared by literature procedures (J. Fluorine Chem. 1991, 53(1), 61-70). Pyrazoles of Formulae lOb and lOc can also be prepared by literature procedures (Chem. Ser. 1966, 99(1$), 3350-7). A useful alternative for the preparation of lOb and lOc is depicted in Scheme 8. Metallation of the sulfamoyl pyrazole of Formula 13 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by direct halogenation of the anionwith either hexachloroethane or 1.2-dibromotetrachloro ethane affords the halogenated<br>
derivatives of Formula 14. Removal of the sulfamoyl group with trirluoroacenc acid (TFA) at ro om temperature proceeds cleanly and in go o d yield to afford the pyrazoles 1 Ob and 1 Oc respectively. Further experimental details for these procedures are described in Example 1.<br>
As an alternative to the method illustrated in Scheme 7, pyrazolecarboxylic acids of Formula 9h and 9i can be prepared by the method outlined in Scheme 9. Reaction of hydrazmopyridine 15 with diethyl maleate affords pyrazolone 16. Chlorination or bromination with phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus oxybromide affords the halo derivatives of Formula 17. Oxidization of a compound of Formula 17 optionally in the presence of acid to give a pyrazole ester followed by conversion of the ester function to the carboxylic acid provides a compound of Formula 9h or 9i. The oxidizing agent can be hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, potassium monopersulfate (e.g., OxoneÂ®) or potassium permanganate.<br>
(Figure Remove)As an alternative to the method illustrated in Scheme 7, pyrazolecarboxylic acids of Formula 9g wherein R5 is CF^ can also be prepared by the method outlined in Scheme 10.<br>
Reaction of a compound of Formula 18 with a suitable base in a suitable organic solvent affords the cychzed product of Formula 19 after neutralization with an acid such as acetic acid. The suitable base can be, for example, sodium hydride, potassium /â€¢-butoxide, dhnsyl sodium (CH3S(O)CH2' Na+), alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) carbonates orhydroxides, tetraalkyl (such as methyl, ethyl or butyl)ammonium fluorides orhydroxides, or 2-terf-buty1imm.o-2-diethylamiao-1,3-dimethyl-perhydro-1,3,2-diazaphosphonine. The suitable organic solvent can be, for example, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, or TV^-dimethylformamide. Dehydration of the compound of Formula 19 to give the compound of Formula 20, followed by converting .the carboxylic ester function to carboxylic acid, affords the acids of Formula 9g. The dehydration is effected by treatment with a catalytic amount of a suitable acid such as sulfuric acid.<br>
Compounds of Formula 18 can be prepared by the method outlined in'Scheme 11.<br>
wherein R5 is CF3.<br>
Treatment of a hydrazine compound of Formula 21 with a ketone of Formula 22 in a solvent such as water, methanol or acetic acid gives the hydrazone of Formula 23. Reaction of the hydrazone of Formula 23 with ethyl oxalyl chloride in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of an acid scavenger such as Iriethylarnine provides the compound of Formula 18. Hydrazine compounds of Formula 21<br>
can be prepared by standard methods, such as by contacting the corresponding halo compound of Formula 11 with hydrazine.<br>
It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula I may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wats, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed; Wiley: New York, 1991).. One skilled in the art will recognize .    that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the ait will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the art will .also recognize that compounds of Formula I and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, ladical, organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to. add substituents or modify existing substituents.<br>

hi certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be particularly advantageous for resistance management Thus, compositions of the present invention can further comprise a biologically effective amount of at least one additional invertebrate pest control compound or agent having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant protection compound (e.g.. protein) or the locus of the plant with a biologically effective amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection and be advantaseous for resistance management<br>
Invertebrate pests are controlled in agronomic and nonagronomic apphcations by applying one or more of the compounds of this invention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present invention farther comprises a method for the control of invertebrates in agronomic and/or nonagronomic applications, comprising contacting the invertebrates or their environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically .    active compound or agent.<br>
A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternatively, a granular composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are also effectively delivered through, plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the soil, a nursery box treatment or a dip of transplants. Compounds are also effective by topical application of a composition comprising a compound of this invention to the locus of infestation. Other methods of contact include application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, seed coatings, micro'encapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into, baits that are consumed by the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99% vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates, particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil 'solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl butoxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest'is rife cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are<br>
sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as S kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square rneter but as little as 0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control<br>
