				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a slow moving electrical motor.<br>
The invention further relates to a slow moving electrical machine, such as a<br>
motor or generator or a combined motor-generator.<br>
Background<br>
A slow moving electrical machine may be used for different purposes, e.g<br>
for land or sea vehicles, for hoisting and lifting equipment and in some cases<br>
also for power generating. Such machines are known as "permanently<br>
magnetized synchronous machines" (PMSM). But some of these machines<br>
are not suitably for an intended, specific purpose, particularly depending on<br>
the conditions of efficiency and space demand.<br>
A growing demand for energy economization, due to energy supply and<br>
energy costs, exists. This particularly applies to motors/generators intended<br>
for vehicles and other purposes being powered by batteries. To reduce the<br>
battery capacity required and extend the operational range or the powder<br>
output of battery powered applications. The highest efficiency possible is<br>
necessary.<br>
In some situations, the need for space economy is also a critical factor.<br>
Objects<br>
The main object of the invention is to create an improved electrical machine,<br>
particularly a motor, which is more energy economical and space saving<br>
than prior art machines for similar purposes. Generally, it is an object to<br>
create an energy efficient electrical machine, which can compete with<br>
existing synchronous machines for industrial purposes, but at the same time<br>
the machine should be suitable for being powered by a battery, to be used for<br>
operating vehicles and other equipment without continuous more power.<br>
It is particularly important to provide an electrical machine suitable for slow<br>
rotation, with electronic drive control, to avoid the need for gears. It is also<br>
desirable to be able to scale the machine within large limits according to the<br>
purpose and also be able to use identical components for different sizes.<br>
Other objects linked to particular areas of use will appear from the<br>
description of embodiments to follow.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to slow moving electrical machine comprising an<br>
annular set of windings on iron cores of laminated sheets or pressed iron<br>
powder, and a corresponding annular set of permanent magnets, particularly<br>
a permanently magnetized synchronous machine (PMSM) for sinus voltage,<br>
characterized by a combination of - windings being concentrated and not<br>
distributed in grooves, winding cores being arranged alternating with iron<br>
cores without windings, every second iron core being provided with a<br>
winding, the number of grooves or intervals between the cores and the<br>
number of poles being different, the number of grooves s and the number of<br>
poles p follow the equations I s-p!=2*m and s=12*n*m<br>
n and m being natural numbers, and that it is built for three phase voltage,<br>
with serial connection of adjoining coils, to make 2*m such groups per<br>
phase, which can be connected in series or in parallel.<br>
This machine has proved suitable as a motor for e.g. vehicles, thrust<br>
propellers and winches. It can be manufactured in different sizes. Within one<br>
size range, identical elements can be used for different purposes, e.g powder<br>
cores, magnets, iron yokes for magnets, coils and the plastic frames for the<br>
powder cores. This standardizing of elements will reduce the manufacturing<br>
costs,<br>
It is possible to adapt an electrical machine according to the invention,<br>
particularly as a motor, to different purposes, e.g. for powering wheel chairs<br>
and other vehicles, for powering thrusters on ships, for winches and for<br>
process applications demanding slow rotation. The need for gears is<br>
eliminated, and the costs will be lower than for corresponding known power<br>
units. The rotational control and the conversion from motor to generator<br>
application in combined use can be achieved with electronic controls based<br>
on known principles, which in most cases can be incorporated into the<br>
housing of the machine.<br>
For motor applications, the electrical machine according to the invention has<br>
several advantages.<br>
- low vibrations under operation, and thus low noise,<br>
- high starting torque,<br>
- high efficiency, particularly when using laminated cores,<br>
- high flexibility in design, particularly with regard to the main<br>
dimensions<br>
- it can easily be provided with double or multiple stator and can thus<br>
be easily scaled up<br>
. based on standard components, particularly powder cores, magnets,<br>
iron yokes, coils and forms with coils.<br>
The invention will bring the greatest advantage used in connection with an<br>
axial field, i.e axially magnetizing. But it will also work with a radial field,<br>
when easy mounting and demounting is particularly important.<br>
Further details of the invention will appear from the following description of<br>
embodiments.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention is described in more detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 shows an axial section of an embodiment adapted for use s a slow<br>
rotating integrated wheel motor for a vehicle. This embodiment may be<br>
applicable to wheel chairs, cars or other transport purposes,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic section through the stator windings with cores of<br>
iron powder,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a diagram for the winding of fig.2.<br>
The electrical machine of Fig.1 is a motor suitable for powering a vehicle,<br>
such as a wheel chair, a car or another transport means with wheels. It may<br>
be provided for periodical use as generator, e.g. at braking. The motor<br>
includes a shaft 11 that, by an inner gradually reduced end 12 with a key<br>
groove 13 and a key 14 is held by a carrier arm 15 or corresponding bracket<br>
on the vehicle. The locking is provided with a nut 16 with a washer 17.<br>
The shaft 11 carries a stator part 18 and a rotating part, both comprising<br>
multiple components. The stator part 18 includes a hub 19 shrunk on the<br>
shaft with a radial central flange 20 emerging into and carrying a cylindrical<br>
stator bushing 21 extending towards the carrier arm 15, but ending in an<br>
axial distance from this element. The stator bushing 21 has a moulded form<br>
22 of plastic with inlaid windings 23 distributed around the circumference.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, eighteen separated stator coils 23 are<br>
provided. The stator coils have, in radial section, a rectangular shape which<br>
will cooperate with a rotor part described below. Details of the stator<br>
windings will also be further described.<br>
As carrier for the rotor and a wheel, an annular inner disk 24 and an annular<br>
outer disk 25 are provided, the outer disk being integrated with a generally<br>
cylindrical rim 26 carried also by the inner disk.<br>
The inner disk 24 is carried by a bearing housing 27 with a bearing 28<br>
mounted on the shaft 11 close to the carrier arm 15. At its circumference the<br>
inner disk 24 is connected to a flange 29 of the rim 26 by screws 30.<br>
The outer disk 25 is mounted on the end of the hub 19 and is connected with<br>
screws 31 to a central enclosure 32 also providing housing for a bearing 33<br>
on the end of the shaft 11. The outer end of the rim 26 has a second flange<br>
34 which together with the inner flange 29 provides space for a tire (not<br>
shown) or another wheel track. For accommodating a tube valve, the rim 26<br>
has an opening 35 adjoining the outer flange 34.<br>
The disks 24 and 25 function as a motor housing and rotor carrier, each<br>
having a set of rotor segments or magnets 36. The magnets 36, thirty-eight<br>
on each side, of the illustrated embodiment, can be manufactured of a known<br>
permanent magnetic material. They are carried by an iron ring 37 mounted<br>
on the respective disks 24, 25 with screws 38 from the outside, It is<br>
important that the number of magnets are different from the number of<br>
grooves between the iron elements of the windings.<br>
Between the magnets 36 and the stator form 22, an airgap A is present. The<br>
airgap is permanent, partly due to the outer arrangement of the bearing 33,<br>
which provides high stability.<br>
For introducing a power cable (not shown) to the windings 23, the shaft 11<br>
has an axial bore 39 which through an inclined bore 40 is communicating<br>
with the a space 41 inside the stator bushing. A continued bore through the<br>
shaft communicates with a space 42 at the end of the shaft, and provides for<br>
accommodating parts of the electronic power control circuits.<br>
The space 41 within the stator bushing 21 can also accommodate<br>
components of the control circuit. A braking device can be arranged in the<br>
free space between the disks 24, 25, for certain purposes, e.g. for the use in<br>
vehicles.<br>
In Fig. 2 the windings of the axial machine of Fig.l are shown<br>
schematically, with three double sets of stator windings 23A, 23B and 23C,<br>
respectively 23 A', 23B' and 23C which are mounted on iron cores 45,<br>
prepared from laminated sheets or iron powder. The coils are arranged<br>
distributed and not in grooves. Each set of windings encloses three iron<br>
cores with a free iron core 46 arranged interchangeably. Thus there are<br>
thirty-six iron cores 45.<br>
Generally, the number of grooves s and the number of poles p follows the<br>
equations<br>
is-p!=2*m and s=12*n*m<br>
n and m being natural numbers, making 2*m such groups per phase, to be<br>
connected in series or parallel.<br>
The set of windings can be connected in series as shown or in parallel, in<br>
both cases for 3 phase feeding (RST).<br>
The embodiment with iron powder has a lower efficiency than<br>
corresponding elements prepared with sheet lam ells, but this is not necessary<br>
for some equipment with a restricted time of use. On the other hand, it will<br>
lower the operating costs substantially.<br>
The stator windings 23 on the iron cores 45 are molded into a plastic<br>
component or stator form 23 (Fig. 1).<br>
In Fig. 3 a winding diagram for the winding of Fig.2 is shown, with at set of<br>
windings for each phase and with the ends prepared for connection in series<br>
or parallel. On the drawing n=3 and m=1.<br>
Modifications<br>
Iron cores in the form of conventional laminates can be used. This provides<br>
a higher efficiency but at somewhat higher costs. The purpose and the<br>
utilization will determine which solution is optimal. The use and design can<br>
be modified according to various needs.<br>
In one embodiment, the disks 24, 25 with the outer rim 26, can be attached<br>
to a carrier, while the shaft II is connected to a unit to be rotated.<br>
