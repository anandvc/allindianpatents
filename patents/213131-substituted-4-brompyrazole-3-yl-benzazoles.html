and the agriculturally useful salts of these compounds I.<br><br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to<br>
-	the use of the compounds I as herbicides and/or for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants,<br>
-	herbicidal compositions and compositions for the desiccation<br>
I   and/or defoliation of plants which comprise the compounds I as active ingredients,<br>
-	processes for preparing the compounds I and herbicidal<br>
compositions and compositions for the desiccation/defoliation<br>
of plants using the compounds I,<br>
i - methods for controlling undesirable vegetation and for the<br>
desiccation and/or defoliation of plants using the compounds I, and also<br>
-	novel intermediates of the formulae Va and Vb.<br>
The present (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles I are covered by the general formula of active compounds which form part of the subject matter of the earlier application DE-A 19 652 24 0.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel ( herbicidally active pyrazole compounds which allow better selective control of undesirable plants than the compounds of the prior art. It is a further object to provide novel compounds which have a desiccant/defoliant action.<br>
We have found that these objects are achieved by the present substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles of the formula I.<br>
Furthermore, we have found herbicidal compositions which comprise the compounds I and have very good herbicidal activity. Moreover, we have found processes for preparing these compositions and methods for controlling undesirable vegetation using the compounds I.<br>
Furthermore, we have found that the compounds I are also suitable for the desiccation/defoliation of parts of plants, suitable plants being crop plants such as cotton, potatoes, oil seed rape, sunflower, soybean or field beans, in particular cotton. Thus, we have found compositions for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants, processes for preparing these compositions and methods for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants using the compounds I.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the compounds of the formula I can contain one or more chiral centers, in which case they exist in the form of enantiomer or diastereomer mixtures. For compounds I having at least one olefinic radical, E/Z isomers<br><br>

The organic moieties mentioned in the definition of the substituents R1, R2 and R5 to R8 or as radicals on cycloalkyl, phenyl or heterocyclic rings are - like the term halogen -collective terms for individual listings of the individual group members. All carbon chains, i.e. all alkyl, haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, oxyalky1, aminoalkyl, oxycarbonylalkyl, aminocarbonylalky1, phosphonylalkyl, oxyaminoalky1, phenylalky1, heterocyclylalkyl, alkenyl, haloalkenyl, cyanoalkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkynyl and cyanoalkynyl moieties, can be straight-chain or branched. Halogenated substituents preferably carry from 1 to 5 identical or different halogen atoms. The term halogen represents in each case fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>

The substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles of the formula I ^an be obtained by various routes, in particular by one of the processes below:<br>
k)  Reaction of an aminophenylpyrazole of the formula Ilia or Illb with a halogen and ammonium thiocyanate or with an alkali metal thiocyanate or alkaline earth metal thiocyanate:<br><br><br>
I <br>
M® = alkali metal ion or 1/2 alkaline earth metal ion<br>
i<br>
The preferred halogen is chlorine or bromine; among the alkali metals/alkaline earth metal thiocyanates, preference is given to sodium thiocyanate.<br>
In general/ the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent/diluent, for example in a hydrocarbon, such as toluene and hexane, in a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane, in an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, in an alcohol, such as ethanol, in a carboxylic acid, such as acetic acid, or in an aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The reaction temperature is usually between the melting point and the boiling point of the reaction mixture, preferably at from 0 to I5O°C.<br>
To achieve as high a yield of the product of value as possible, halogen and ammonium thiocyanate or alkali metal/alkaline earth metal thiocyanate are employed in approximately equimolar amounts or in excess, up to about 5 times the molar amount, based on the amount of Ilia or Illb.<br>
A variant of the process entails reacting the aminophenylpyrazole Ilia or Illb initially with ammonium thiocyanate or an alkali metal thiocyanate or alkaline earth metal thiocyanate to give a thiourea IVa or IVb<br><br><br>
and converting IVa or IVb subsequently into I where Z = -N=C(XR6)-S- by treatment with halogen.<br>
Bj Diazotization of an aminophenylpyrazole of the formula Ilia or Illb, conversion of the respective diazonium salt into an azidophenylpyrazole of the formula Va or Vb and its reaction either<br>
B.l)with a carboxylic acid or B.2)initially with a sulfonic acid (to give Via or VIb),<br>
hydrolysis of the sulfonate formed to give aminophenol Vila<br>
or Vllb, and its conversion into I:<br><br><br><br>
For carrying out the diazotization, the details given for process C) apply. The conversion into the aryl azides Va/Vb is preferably carried out by reacting Illa/IIIb with an alkali metal azide or alkaline earth metal azide such as sodium azide, or by reaction with trimethylsilyl azide.<br>
The reaction with a carboxylic acid mentioned under B.l) is either carried out in an inert solvent, for example in an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, an aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide and acetonitrile, a hydrocarbon, such as toluene and hexane, a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane, or in the absence of a solvent in an excess of carboxylic acid R6-COOH. In the latter case, the addition of a mineral acid, such as phosphoric acid, may be advantageous.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at elevated temperature, for example at the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
For the reaction of Va/Vb with a sulfonic acid Ra-SC&gt;3H (where Ra is Ci-C4-alkyl or Ci-C4-haloalkyl, preferably methyl or trifluoromethyl) mentioned first under B.2), the details given above for the reaction of Va/Vb with R6-COOH apply. The subsequent hydrolysis of the sulfonates Vla/VIb is preferably carried out by reaction with an aqueous base, such as sodium hydroxide solution and potassium hydroxide solution, it being possible to add, if desired, a solvent, for example an ether, such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, or an alcohol, such as methanol and ethanol.<br>
The concluding reaction to give I is known per se and can be carried out in an extremely multifarious manner. In this context, reference is made to the details given in Houben-Weyl,<br><br>
Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Vol. E8a 1993, p. 1032 ffl<br>
The azidophenylpyrazoles of the formulae Va and Vb are new. Particularly preferred compounds of the formula Va are the compounds Va.l - Va.9 mentioned in Table 2 below:<br><br>
Diazotization of substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles of the formula I in which XR6 is amino, and subsequent conversion of the diazonium salt into compounds I where<br>
-	-XR6 = cyano or halogen {for the Sandmeyer reaction, cf.,<br>
for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie,<br>
Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Vol. 5/4, 4th edition I960,<br>
p. 438ff.},<br>
-	-X- = sulfur {cf., for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der<br>
Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Vol.Ell<br>
1984, p. 43 and 176},<br>
-	-XR6 = for example -CH2-CH(halogen)-R8, -CH=CH-R8,<br>
-CH=C(halogen)-R8 {in general, these are products of a<br>
Meerwein arylation; cf., for example, C.S. Rondestredt, Org.<br>
React, ii, (1960), 189 and H.P. Doyle et al., J. Org. Chem.<br>
12, (1977) 2431}:<br><br>
In general, the diazonium salt is obtained in a manner known per se by reacting I where -XR6 = amino in an aqueous solution of an acid, for example in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid, with a nitrite, such as sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite.<br><br>
However, it is also possible to carry out the reaction in the absence of water, for example in hydrogen chloride-containing glacial acetic acid, in absolute alcohol, in dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, in acetonitrile or in acetone and to treat the starting material (I where -XR6 = NH2) with a nitrous acid ester, such as tert-butyl nitrite and isopentyl nitrite.<br>
The conversion of the diazonium salt obtained in this manner into the corresponding compound I where -XR6 = cyano, chlorine, bromine or iodine is particularly preferably carried out by treatment with a solution or suspension of a copper(I) salt, such as copper(I) cyanide, copper(I) chloride, copper(I) bromide and copper(I) iodide, or with a solution of an alkali metal salt.<br>
Compounds I where -X- = sulfur are usually obtained by reacting the diazonium salt with a dialkyl disulfide, such as dimethyl disulfide and diethyl disulfide, or by using, for example, diallyl disulfide or dibenzyl disulfide.<br>
The Meerwein arylation usually comprises the reaction of the diazonium salts with alkenes (here: H2C = CH-R8) or alkynes (here: HC=C-R8). Here, preference is given to employing an excess of the alkene or alkyne of up to about 3000 mol%, based on the amount of the diazonium salt.<br>
The above-described reactions of the diazonium salt can be carried out, for example, in water, in aqueous hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, in a ketone, such as acetone, diethyl ketone and methyl ethyl ketone, in a nitrile, such as acetonitrile, in an ether, such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, or in an alcohol, such as methanol and ethanol.<br>
Unless stated otherwise for the individual reactions, the reaction temperatures are usually at from (-30) to +50°C.<br>
Preference is given to using all the reaction participants in approximately stoichiometric amounts; however, an excess of one the other component of up to about 3000 mol% may be advantageous.<br><br>
D) Oxidation of a substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazole I, in which X is sulfur to give I where X = -SO- in a manner known per se (cf., for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Vol. E 11/1, 1985, p. 702 ff., Vol. IX, 4th edition, 1955, p. 211):<br><br>
Suitable oxidizing agents are, for example, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, such as peracetic acid, trifluoroperacetic acid, m-chloroperbenzoic acid, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hypochlorite, and also inorganic compounds, such as sodium metaiodate, chromic acid and nitric acid.<br>
Depending on the oxidizing agent, the reaction is usually carried out in an organic acid, such as acetic acid and trichloroacetic acid, in a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane, in an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, chlorobenzene and toluene, or in a protic solvent, such as methanol and ethanol. Mixtures of the abovementioned solvents are also suitable.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally at from (-30)°C to the boiling point of the reaction mixture in question, and preference is usually given to the lower temperature range.<br>
Advantageously, starting material and oxidizing agent are employed in an approximately stoichiometric ratio; however, it is also possible to employ an excess of one or the other component.<br>
Ej Oxidation of a substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazole I, where X is sulfur or -SO-, to give I where X = -SO2- in a manner known per se (cf., for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Vol. E 11/2, 1985, p. 1132 ff. and Vol. IX, 4th edition, 1955, p. 222 ff.):<br><br>
Suitable oxidizing agents are, for example, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, such as peracetic acid, trifluoroperacetic acid and m-chloroperbenzoic acid, furthermore inorganic oxidizing agents, such as potassium permanganate. The presence of a catalyst, for example tungstate, can have advantageous effects on the course of the reaction.<br><br>
In general, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent; suitable solvents being, depending on the oxidizing agent, for example organic acids, such as acetic acid and propionic acid, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane, aromatic hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as benzene, chlorobenzene and toluene, or water. It is also possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned solvents.<br>
Usually, the reaction is carried out at from (-30)°C to the boiling point of the reaction mixture in question, preferably at from 10°C to the boiling point.<br>
Advantageously, the starting material I where X = sulfur or SO and the oxidizing agent are employed in approximately stoichiometric amounts. However, to optimize the conversion of the starting material, it may be advisable to employ an excess of oxidizing agent.<br>
Fj Reaction of a substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazole I where the grouping -XR6 is chlorine, bromine, alkylsulfonyl or haloalkylsulfonyl in the presence of a base with an alcohol, mercaptan, amine or a CH-acidic compound (VIII):<br><br>
Rb and Rc independently of one another are each cyano or (C1-C4-alkoxy)carbonyl.<br>
Advantageously, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, for example in an ether, such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, dimethoxy ethane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, a ketone, such as acetone, diethyl ketone, ethyl methyl ketone and cyclohexanone, a dioplar aprotic solvent, such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and dimethyl sulfoxide, a protic solvent such as methanol and ethanol, an aromatic, if desired halogenated, hydrocarbon, such as benzene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene, a heteroaromatic solvent, such as pyridine and quinoline, or in a mixture of such solvents. Tetrahydrofuran, acetone, diethyl ketone and dimethylformamide are preferred.<br><br>
Suitable bases are, for example, the hydroxides, hydrides, alkoxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cations, tertiary aliphatic amines, such as triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and N-ethyl-N,N-diisopropylamine, bi- and tricyclic amines, such as diazabicycloundecane (DBU) and diazabicyclooctane (DABCO), or aromatic nitrogen bases, such as pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and quinoline. Combinations of different bases are also suitable. Preferred bases are sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide.<br>
The amines H2NR6 or HN(R6)R7 may serve as reaction participants and simultaneously as bases, in which case the amine should be present in at least a two-fold excess, based on the amount of the starting material I. It is, of course, also possible to employ a greater excess of amine, up to approximately 10 times the molar amount, based on the amount of I where -XR6 = Cl, Br, -SO2-alkyl or -SO2-haloalkyl.<br>
The starting materials are generally employed in approximately stoichiometric amounts; however, an excess of one or the other components may be advantageous with a view to the practice of the process or to obtain as complete a conversion of the starting material I {-XR6 = Cl, Br, -S02-alkyl, -SO2-haloalkyl} as possible.<br>
The molar ratio of alcohol, mercaptan, amine or CH-acidic compound (VIII) to base is generally from 1:1 to 1:3.<br>
The concentration of the starting materials in the solvent is usually at from 0.1 to 5.0 mol/1.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at temperatures of from O°C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture in question.<br>
j Reaction of a substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazole I in which -XR6 is halogen with a (C^Ce-alkyl)-Grignard reagent:<br><br>
Here, Hal is chloride or bromide.<br><br>
In general, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent/diluent, for example a hydrocarbon, such as hexane or toluene, or an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
If desired, it is possible to add a transition metal catalyst in amounts of from 0.0001 to 10 mol%. Suitable transition metal catalysts are, for example, nickel and palladium catalysts, such as nickel dichloride, bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel dichloride, [bis(1,2-diphenylphosphino)ethane]nickel dichloride, [bis(1,3-diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel dichloride, palladium dichloride, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloroide, [bis(1,2-diphenylphosphino)ethane]palladium dichloride, [bis(1,3-diphenylphosphino)propane]palladium dichloride and [bis(diphenylphospino)ferrocene]palladium dichloride, but also mixtures of palladium dichloride or nickel dichloride and phosphines, such as triphenylphosphine, bis-1,2-(diphenylphosphino)ethane and bis-1,3-(diphenylphosphino)propane.<br>
Depending on the practice of the reaction, this gives rise to compounds I where -XR6 = hydrogen or Ci-Ce-alkyl or to corresponding compounds of alkylated and non-alkylated compound I which can, however, be separated in a customary manner.<br>
In general, the reaction is carried out at from (-100)°C to the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
The amount of Grignard reagent is not critical; usually, (Ci-Ce-alkyl)-MgHal is employed in an approximately equimolar amount or in excess, up to about 10 times the molar amount, based on the amount of I where -XR6 = halogen.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, all the processes described above are advantageously carried out under atmospheric pressure or under the autogenous pressure of the reaction mixture in question.<br>
The work-up of the reaction mixtures is usually carried out in a conventional manner. Unless stated otherwise in the processes described above, the products of value are obtained, for example, after the dilution of the reaction solution with water by filtration, crystallization or solvent extraction, or by removing the solvent, partitioning the residue in a mixture of water and a suitable organic solvent and work-up of the organic phase to afford the product.<br><br>
The substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles I can be obtained as isomer mixtures in the preparation; however, if desired, these can be separated into largely pure isomers using customary methods such as crystallization or chromatography, including chromatography over an optically active adsorbate. Pure optically active isomers can be prepared advantageously from suitable optically active starting materials.<br>
Agriculturally useful salts of the compounds I can be formed by reaction with a base of the corresponding cation, preferably an alkali metal hydroxide or hydride, or by reaction with an acid of the corresponding anion, preferably of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or nitric acid.<br>
Salts of I where the metal ion is not an alkali metal ion can be prepared by cation exchange of the corresponding alkali metal salt in a conventional manner, similarly ammonium, phosphonium, sulfonium and sulfoxonium salts by means of ammonia, phosphonium, sulfonium or sulfoxonium hydroxides.<br>
The compounds I and their agriculturally useful salts are suitable, both in the form of isomer mixtures and in the form of the pure isomers, as herbicides. The herbicidal compositions comprising I control vegetation on non-crop areas very efficiently, especially at high rates of application. They act against broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds in crops such as wheat, rice, maize, soya and cotton without causing any significant damage to the crop plants. This effect is mainly observed at low rates of application.<br>
Taking into account the universality of the application methods, the compounds I, or herbicidal compositions comprising them, can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are the following:<br>
Allium cepa, Ananas comosus, Arachis hypogaea, Asparagus officinalis, Beta vulgaris spec, altissima, Beta vulgaris spec, rapa, Brassica napus var. napus, Brassica napus var. napobrassica, Brassica rapa var. silvestris, Camellia sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Carya illinoinensis, Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis, Coffea arabica (Coffea canephora, Coffea liberica), Cucumis sativus, Cynodon dactylon, Daucus carota, Elaeis guineensis, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, (Gossypium arboreum, Gossypium herbaceum, Gossypium vitifolium), Helianthus annuus, Hevea brasiliensis, Hordeum vulgare, Humulus lupulus, Ipomoea batatas, Juglans regia, Lens culinaris, Linum usitatissimum, Lycopersicon lycopersicum, Malus spec., Manihot<br><br>
esculenta, Medicago sativa, Musa spec, Nicotiana tabacum (N.rustica), Olea europaea, Oryza sativa, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, Picea abies, Pinus spec, Pisum sativum, Prunus avium, Prunus persica, Pyrus communis, Ribes sylvestre,     › Ricinus communis, Saccharum officinarum, Secale cereale, Solanum tuberosum, Sorghum bicolor (s. vulgare), Theobroma cacao, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, Triticum durum, Vicia faba, Vitis vinifera and Zea mays.<br>
In addition, the compounds I may also be used in crops which tolerate the action of herbicides owing to breeding, including genetic engineering methods.<br>
Moreover, the substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles I are also suitable for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants.<br>
As desiccants, they are suitable, in particular, for desiccating the aerial parts of crop plants such as potatoes, oilseed rape, sunflowers and soybeans. This allows completely mechanical harvesting of these important crop plants.<br>
It is also of economic interest to facilitate harvesting, which is made possible by concentrating, over a period of time, dehiscence, or reducing the adherence to the tree, in citrus fruit, olives or other species and varieties of pomaceous fruit, stone fruit and nuts. The same mechanism, i.e. promotion of the formation of abscission tissue between fruit or leaf and shoot of the plants, is also important for readily controllable defoliation of useful plants, in particular cotton.<br>
Moreover, shortening the period within which the individual cotton plants mature results in improved fiber quality after harvesting.<br>
The compounds I, or the compositions comprising them, can be used for example in the form of ready-to-spray aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend on the intended aims; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries are essentially: mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point, such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin,<br><br>
aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, e.g. amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone, and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, either as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates comprising active compound, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if desired, solvent or oil, which are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, and also of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl or tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or grinding the active compounds together with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active compounds to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of<br><br>
vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders, or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds I in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight of at least one active compound. The active compounds I are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>

The mixture can then be diluted with water to the desired concentration of active compound. This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
The active compounds I or the herbicidal compositions can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the active compounds are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spraying equipment, in such a way that they come into as little contact as possible, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants, while the active compounds reach the leaves of undesirable plants growing underneath, or the bare soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br><br>
The rates of application of active compound I are from 0.001 to 3.0, preferably 0.01 to 1.0, kg/ha of active substance (a.s.), depending on the control target, the season, the target plants and the growth stage.<br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to achieve synergistic effects, the substituted (4-bromopyrazol-3-yl)benzazoles I may be mixed with a large number of representatives of other herbicidal or growth-regulating active compounds and then applied concomitantly. Suitable components for mixtures are, for example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric acid and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, aryl/hetaryl-oxyalkanoic acids and their derivatives, benzoic acid and its derivatives, benzothiadiazinones, 2-(hetaroyl/aroyl)-1,3-cyclohexanediones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzyl-isoxazolidinones, meta-CF3-phenyl derivatives, carbamates, quinolinecarboxylic acid and its derivates, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexane-1,3-dione derivatives, diazines, dichloropropionic acid and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic acids and their derivatives, ureas, 3-phenyluracils, imidazoles, imidazolinones, N-phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimides, oxadiazoles, oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- and hetaryloxyphenoxypropionic esters, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives, 2-phenylpropionic acid and its derivatives, pyrazoles, phdtiylpyrazoleis,, pyridazines, pyridinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, pyrimidyl ethers, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones, triazolecarboxamides and uracils.<br>
It may furthermore be advantageous to apply the compounds I, alone or in combination with other herbicides, in the form of a mixture with other crop protection agents, for example together with agents for controlling pests or phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions, which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>

Use examples (herbicidal activity)<br>
The herbicidal activity of the substituted pyrazol-3-ylbenzazoles [sic] I was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments:<br>
The culture containers used were plastic flowerpots with loamy sand containing approximately 3.0% of humous as substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown separately for each species*<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the active compounds, which had been suspended or emulsified in water, were applied directly after seeding using finely distributing nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and subsequently covered with translucent plastic hoods until the plants had taken roots. This cover causes uniform germination of the test plants unless this was adversely affected by the active compounds.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were initially grown to a height of 3-15 cm, depending on the habit, and only then treated with the active compounds which had been suspended or emulsified in water. To this end, the test plants were either sown directly and cultivated in the same vessels, or they were initially cultivated separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to the treatment.<br><br>
The plants were kept-at temperatures of 10-25ºC and 2O-35°C, depending on the species. The test period extended over 2-4 weeks. During this time, the plants were tended, and their reaction to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br>
Evaluation was carried out using a scale from 0 to 100. 100 means no emergence of the plants, or complete destruction of at least the above-ground parts, and 0 means no damage or normal course of growth.<br>
Use examples (desiccant/defoliant activity)<br>
The test plants used were young cotton plants having 4 leaves (without cotyledon) which were grown under greenhouse conditions (rel• atmospheric humidity 50-70%; temperature by day/by night 27/20ºC).<br>
The leaves of the young cotton plants were treated to runoff point with aqueous preparations of the active compounds (with addition of 0.15% by weight of the fatty alcohol alkoxylate Plurafac® LF 7001), based on the spray liquor). The amount of water applied was 1000 1/ha (converted). After 13 days, the number of leaves which had been shed and the degree of defoliation in % were determined.<br>
In the untreated control plants, no defoliation was observed.<br><br><br><br><br>
