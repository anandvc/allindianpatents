				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of supplying emulsion lubrication oil enabling high productivity and improvement of the specific consumption of oil in a rolling machine for a metal material, in particular cold tandem rolling machines having a group of four or more stands of cold rolling machines.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In cold tandem rolling by emulsion lubrication, it is known that the emulsion lubrication oil supplied to the rolled material at the stand inlet side or the rolls separates into water and oil, the effect of the wedge shape formed at the roll bite inlet causes the oil to mainly be drawn into the roll bite due to its higher viscosity than the water, and therefore an oil film is formed between the rolls and the rolled material. Note that below, the phenomenon of the lubrication oil supplied to the rolls and the rolled material separating into water and oil and spreading is called "plate-out".<br>
In general, the effect of the wedge shape drawing in the lubrication oil is remarkably improved together with the increase in the rolling speed. Therefore, at a lower speed front stand, the friction coefficient becomes large, while at a higher speed rear stand, the friction coefficient becomes small. If the friction coefficient becomes larger, the possibility of occurrence of seizure flaws called "heat scratches" becomes higher. If the friction coefficient is too small, slip occurs and becomes a cause of flaws. Therefore, with cold rolling, control of the friction coefficient to a suitable range becomes an important problem.<br>
However, in a single rolling mill performing cold tandem rolling, usually one type of lubrication oil is<br>
used (for example, the base oil, emulsion concentration, temperature, etc. are managed to be constant). In the case of a rolling mill having two or more types of lubrication oil tanks, the lubrication base oil, the emulsion concentration, etc. can be changed. For example, a method of selective use of lubrication oils at a front stand and a rear stand etc. can be realized, so it is possible to advantageously control the friction coefficient in cold rolling to a suitable range.<br>
In a rolling mill having only one tank, such selective use of lubrication oils is not possible. Further, newly increasing tanks would require capital investment, so while depending also on the kinds of the rolled products of the rolling mill, sometimes it is difficult to make full use of the capacity of the rolling mill with the current facilities as it and maintain the friction coefficients of all rolling stands in a suitable range for all sorts of rolled products.<br>
Various inventions have been made up until now for solving such problems arising from lubrication of rolling. Note that increasing the friction coefficient can be relatively easily realized both technology and cost wise by decreasing the supply rate of the emulsion lubrication oil or decreasing the emulsion concentration, so in the past mainly methods for increasing the amount of plate-out to decrease the friction coefficient have been developed. Among these, as inventions for controlling the supply pressure etc. of nozzles to decrease the friction coefficient and thereby maintain the friction coefficient in a suitable range, there are the following examples. That is, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-009021 discloses an invention for adding a coagulating agent and setting the nozzle pressure to 5 kg/cm2 to 15 kg/cm2 (0.5 MPa to 1.5 MPa). Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-269710 discloses an invention for setting the particle size of the emulsion and positions of the nozzles along<br>
with the nozzle pressure. These inventions, in a word, increase the nozzle pressure and increase the kinetic energy in order to increase the efficiency of friction of the lubrication oil to the rolled material. Further, they are based on the idea that since lubrication oil adhering to the rolled material separates into water and oil and is introduced into the roll bite, if the amount of plate-out to the rolled material increases, the amount of oil introduced also increases.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A schematic view of the suitable range of the friction coefficient in cold rolling of high tension steel sheet (below, called "hi-tension steel sheet), which is increasing in volume of production in recent years, in comparison with that of mild steel sheet is shown in FIG. 1. Hi-tension steel sheet is hard and is susceptible to seizure, so at the time of high speed rolling, it is necessary to control the friction coefficient to a smaller one not giving rise to seizure. On the other hand, mild steel is less susceptible to seizure compared with hi-tension steel sheet. If overly reducing the friction coefficient at the time of high speed rolling, there is a danger of slip occurring due to excessive lubrication. Therefore, it is necessary to set the friction coefficient greater than with hi-tension steel sheet.<br>
Further, FIG. 2 shows the range of friction coefficient able to be taken in the case of using conventional lubrication oil in the conventional range of operation based on the inventions described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 7-009021 to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-269710. Conventional lubrication oil is developed in accordance with the conditions of mild steel, so as will be understood from the figure, when rolling hi-tension steel sheet, in order to keep the friction coefficient within the range of the friction coefficient of conventional<br>
oil, it is necessary to keep the rolling speed down during the rolling.<br>
The inventors developed rolling lubrication oil considering rolling of hi-tension steel sheet as shown in FIG. 3, but were not able to realize a suitable range of the friction coefficient for both mild steel and hi-tension steel sheet within the operating range up to now. Further, at the time of high speed rolling, upward elasticity of the range of friction coefficient so as to realize an friction coefficient suitable for mild steel has been sought.<br>
Therefore, under this situation, the present invention has as its object to provide a method of supplying lubrication oil in cold rolling able to realize rolling from a low speed region to a high speed region by one type of lubrication oil (base oil, emulsion concentration, and temperature etc. are constant) regardless of the rolled product and in turn able to avoid rolling trouble and realize high productivity and improve the specific consumption of lubrication oil.<br>
In conventional cold tandem rolling, the method of supplying emulsion lubrication oil toward the rolls or rolled material by nozzles is the mainstream. Various inventions have been made for reducing the friction coefficient, but the problem tackled by the present invention is the excessive lubrication at the time of high speed rolling, therefore means for increasing the friction coefficient have become necessary. The inventors first tried to realize a range of friction coefficient suited to mild steel by changing the supply rate among the above-mentioned methods for increasing the friction coefficient. Note that there is only one lubrication oil tank, so when changing the emulsion concentration, this affects all stands, therefore it is necessary to avoid any change in concentration. No experiments were conducted either.<br>
It was learned that when reducing the supply rate of<br>
the lubrication oil, the friction coefficient increases and can be kept within the suitable range of mild steel, but the problems arise that the supply of the lubrication oil in the width direction becomes uneven, heat is generated at parts with little supply of lubrication oil and the thermal crown grows in parts, and shape disturbances are induced, so the method of changing the supply rate cannot be employed.<br>
The inventors studied the method of increasing the friction coefficient by other methods. As a result, the inventors newly discovered the method of increasing the pipe pressure of the lubrication oil supply nozzles so as to obtain an upward elasticity of the friction coefficient at the tine of high speed rolling. The present invention was made based on this new discovery. Its gist is as follows:<br>

BEST MODE FOR WORKING THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors conducted rolling experiments using refined palm oil and calculated the friction coefficient during rolling. As a result, they learned that even if the supply rate of the lubrication oil is constant, at a high pressure of the conventionally used lubrication nozzle pressure or more, the lubrication nozzle pressure increases and the friction coefficient increases (see FIG. 4). FIG. 4 shows the results of the refined palm oil, but when a similar experiment was conducted by other actually used animal oils and synthetic esters, while the friction coefficient differed in magnitude, there was almost no change in the pressure where the effect starts,<br>
i.e., it was 0.5 MPa or more. Here, the lubrication oil was not supplied independently for the rolled material and the rolls; the method of supplying it by direct injection to the roll bite inlet was employed.<br>
As explained above, it is known that the lubrication oil supplied to the rolls or rolled material separates into water and oil and that the easily separable lubrication oil easily reduces the friction coefficient and is suitable for high speed rolling. Conversely speaking, by obstructing separation of water and oil, it becomes possible to cause deterioration of the lubrication ability. In practice, it is known that if performing high speed rolling, depending on the lubrication oil, sometimes the amount of oil introduced is reduced and the friction coefficient is increased. One factor is believed to be that the time of high speed rolling, turbulence occurs at the oil pool formed at the roll bite inlet and the amount of oil introduced to the roll bite decreases. If comparing and studying this discovery and the results of FIG. 4, it is believed that the reason why the friction coefficient increases when keeping the supply rate constant and increasing the lubrication nozzle pressure is that turbulence occurs at the roll bite inlet and the amount of oil introduced to the roll bite decreases. From the above, in the present invention, since if no turbulence is caused, there is also no reduction in the amount of oil, supplying the lubrication oil by direct injection toward the roll bite inlet becomes an essential condition.<br>
In the aspect of the present invention described in (2), the provision of a plurality of lubrication nozzles comprised of pairs of two types of nozzles of low pressure nozzles and high pressure nozzles for each rolling stand is made one requirement, but due to this it becomes possible to selectively use the two types of nozzles and satisfy the required lubrication nozzle pressure in accordance with the rolling speed of each<br>
rolling stand. FIG. 7 is a view schematically showing an arrangement of lubrication nozzles comprised of pairs of high pressure nozzles 5a and low pressure nozzles 5b. Here, "low pressure nozzles" indicates nozzles ordinarily used in the past. Further, having the low pressure nozzles and the high pressure nozzles overlap in pressure range at the intermediate pressure region makes the transition smooth at the intermediate pressure region, so is good. In this case, for the intermediate lubrication nozzle pressure, it is possible to use either of or possible to use both of the low pressure nozzles and high pressure nozzles to satisfy the required lubrication conditions. According to the aspect of the present invention described in (2), it is sufficient to change half of the nozzles from the nozzle configuration of the existing rolling facility to high pressure nozzles, so it becomes possible to keep down capital investment.<br>
Next, the aspect of the present invention described in (3) will be explained. As explained above, from the discovery of FIG. 4 etc., it is learned that it is possible to increase the lubrication nozzle pressure to shift to a direction lowering the lubrication ability and thereby avoid excessive lubrication, but if increasing the lubrication nozzle pressure to increase even the supply rate of the lubrication oil, the yield of the lubrication oil deteriorates, so this is not preferable. Further, increasing the lubrication oil supply rate acts in a direction improving the lubrication ability, so deterioration of the lubrication ability may be cancelled out. Therefore, even if increasing the nozzle pipe pressure, it is necessary to maintain the supply rate constant. As that, means, the method of reducing the number of lubrication nozzles used is employed in the aspect of the present invention described in (3) (see FIG. 5(a) and FIG. 5(b)). That is, FIG. 5(a) and FIG. 5(b) show an example of the method of adjusting the number of nozzles for realizing the rolling method<br>
described in the aspect of the present invention of (3), FIG. 5 (a) shows the state of reduction of the number of nozzles, and FIG. 5(b) schematically shows the state before reduction of the number of nozzles by a plan view, wherein 1 indicates a work roll, 4 a rolled material, 5 a lubrication nozzle, and 6 a lubrication nozzle pipe. Note that usually the number of lubrication nozzles is limited, so only step-wise control is possible, but existing facilities can be used as they are, so capital investment becomes unnecessary and therefore this example can be said to be superior cost wise.<br>
Next, the aspect of the present invention described in (4) will be explained. If investing in capital and using high performance lubrication nozzles, even when changing the lubrication nozzle pressure, it is possible to maintain the supply rate of the lubrication oil constant. In such high performance nozzles, for example, the lubrication nozzle pressure and the amount of supply are determined by the size of the nozzle discharge port, so by using lubrication nozzles enabling free control of the sizes of the nozzle discharge ports on line, it becomes possible to obtain the above effect.<br>
Next, the aspect of the present invention described in (5) will be explained. While lubrication oil is directly sprayed and supplied to the inlet of the roll bite, it sometimes flows down from the roll at the back side of the strip and therefore the state of lubrication does not become equal at the upper and back of the strip, so controlling the pressure separately at the upper side and back side is a preferred embodiment with a large effect.<br>
In the above way, according to the present invention, it becomes possible to supply lubrication oil to the roll bite at a high pressure, it becomes possible to realize a suitable friction coefficient without regard as to the rolled product (steel), and a high productivity and improvement in the specific consumption of oil are<br>
realized without rolling trouble.<br>
Note that as the type of metal of the rolled sheet covered by the present invention, in addition to steel, titanium, aluminum, magnesium, copper, or another metal and various alloys of the same may also be used.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
(Example 1)<br>
To confirm the effects of the present invention, the inventors changed the lubrication nozzle pressure and conducted experiments on rolling coils. For the experiment, the laboratory rolling machine shown in FIG. 6 was used. Reference numerals la and Ib indicate work rolls, 2a and 2b intermediate rolls, and 3a and 3b backup rolls. Reference numeral 4 indicates a rolled material of a sheet width of 300 rnm made of mild steel set to a rolling reduction ratio of 11% (sheet thickness reduced from 0.25 mm to 0.2 mm). Reference numeral 5 indicates a lubrication oil supply nozzle, the diameter of the work rolls is 300 mm, the diameter of the intermediate rolls is 360 mm, and the diameter of the backup rolls is 600 mm. The lubrication oil used is a 13% emulsion heated in a tank to 60°C and based on refined palm oil. The rolling speed was increased from 500 m/min and the operation ended at a maximum rolling speed of 1800 m/min. At a rolling speed of 1200 m/min or less, the lubrication nozzle pressure was set at 0.3 MPa, while at 1200 m/min or more, it was set at 0.8 MPa. At this time, the supply rate of the lubrication oil was about 30 liter/min at 0.3 MPa and about 70 liter/min at 0.8 MPa. After rolling, the sheet was uncoiled and its surface was observed. Further, the inventors calculated the friction coefficient from the actually measured rate of progression and load and confirmed that the friction coefficient decreased somewhat as the speed became higher from about 0.03, but no slip occurred.<br>
Next, as a comparative example, the inventors conducted rolling experiments in the same way in the low<br>
speed region without changing the pressure and leaving it at 0.3 MPa and confirmed that slip occurred at a rolling speed of 1500 m/min.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
To hold the total supply rate constant when changing the lubrication nozzle pressure, the inventors conducted rolling experiments by different lubrication supply methods such as (i) the method of supplying lubrication oil based on reducing the number of nozzles used (see FIG. 5), (ii) the method of supplying lubrication oil based on changing the size of the lubrication oil discharge port of the nozzles when changing the lubrication nozzle pressure, and (iii) the method of supplying lubrication oil using lubrication nozzles comprised of pairs of low pressure nozzles and high pressure nozzles. The other conditions were made to match with the conditions of Example 1. In the method of supplying lubrication oil of (i), the inventors investigated the relationship between the lubrication nozzle pressure and supply rate in advance. When increasing the lubrication nozzle pressure, as shown in E"IG. 5, they stopped the supply from the nozzles evenly at the left and right in the sheet width direction. In the method of supplying lubrication oil of (iii), the low pressure nozzles were made ones able to be used at a pressure of 0.6 MPa or less and the high pressure nozzles were made ones able to be used at a pressure of 0.3 MPa or more. In the intermediate region, the high pressure nozzles were used. In each case, in the same way as the experiment of Example 1 explained above, slip did not occur until 1800 m/min.<br>
Next, as a comparative example, the inventors conducted rolling experiments by the method of supplying lubrication oils (iv) when not changing the number of nozzles used, (v) when not controlling the size of the lubrication oil discharge port of the nozzles, and (vi) when using low pressure nozzles even at a high speed,<br>
whereupon in the methods of supplying lubrication oil of (iv) and (v), the specific consumption of lubrication oil deteriorated and 1.2 to 1.4 times the lubrication oil was used. Further, with the method of supplying lubrication oil of (vi), it was only possible to raise the lubrication nozzle pressure to 0.6 MPa, so slip occurred at 1400 m/min.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
In Examples 1 and 2, examples of control based on the upper side of the rolled material were explained. Here, the inventors controlled the supply of the lubrication oil separately at the upper side and back side of the rolled material by the method of controlling the size of the lubrication oil discharge port of the nozzles for maintaining the lubrication oil supply rate constant under the conditions of Example 2 (ii), that is, changing the lubrication nozzle pressure.<br>
At the back side, of the rolled material, the lubrication oil sprayed from the nozzles drops down due to gravity, so lubrication easily becomes insufficient compared with the upper side of the rolled material and slip does not easily occur, so the inventors investigated the range by which the lubrication nozzle pressure can be reduced and the amount of reduction of the specific consumption of lubrication oil by (xi) the method of supplying lubrication oil of reducing the lubrication nozzle pressure at the back side of the rolled material and (xii) the method of supplying lubrication oil of reducing the lubrication nozzle pressure at the back side of the rolled material and reducing the lubrication oil supply rate. As a result, they learned that with the method of supplying lubrication oil of (xi), there is no need for as high a lubrication nozzle pressure as the upper side of the rolled material and the current existing pumps can handle it and that with the method of supplying lubrication oil of (xii), it is possible to reduce the specific consumption of lubrication oil by 10%<br>
compared with the case of Example 2.<br><br><br><br>
