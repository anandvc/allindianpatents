3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Description<br>
Thread splicing device<br>
The invention relates to a thread splicing device according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Thread splicing devices have been known for a long time, in particular in conjunction with automatic cross-winding machines, in the textile machine industry.<br>
Such thread splicing devices, which have proven successful in practice, are described in detail in DE 42 40 728 Al or in the Manual "Autoconer 338" from Schlafhorst Winding Systems.<br>
Two thread ends can be intermingled pneumatically with thread splicing devices of this type to form a knot-free connection, which virtually has yarn strength and ideally has an appearance almost identical to yarn. In other words, when a thread breakage occurs at one of the winding heads of an automatic cross-winding machine during the winding process, or when a defined clearer cut has been carried out at one of the winding heads of the textile machine because of a thread defect, the thread ends of the severed thread are firstly retrieved by special pneumatic mechanisms into the region of the thread splicing device. A suction nozzle in this case retrieves the so-called upper thread from the cross-wound bobbin and places it, optionally after clearing the thread defect, in the splicing channel of the splicing head of the thread splicing device.<br>
In this case, the thread is moreover threaded by the suction nozzle into a thread clamping mechanism arranged above the splicing channel and a thread cutting mechanism positioned below the splicing channel. The so-called lower thread, which originates from a feed bobbin positioned in the winding position, is accordingly also<br>
2<br><br>
inserted by means of a gripper tube, which can be loaded by a vacuum, into the splicing channel and threaded into a thread clamping mechanism arranged below the splicing channel and into a thread cutting mechanism arranged above the splicing channel. The thread ends are the cut to length by the thread cutting mechanisms, sucked into so-called holding and opening tubes and prepared there for the subsequent splicing process. In other words, the thread ends are firstly substantially freed of their yarn rotation in the holding and opening tubes before they are drawn back into the splicing channel by a thread feed in such a way that the thread ends are located next to one another in the splicing channel, oriented in opposite directions, and can be finally pneumatically intermingled there.<br>
In these known thread splicing devices, which have proven successful per se, the various functional elements of the thread splicing device, in particular, the thread clamping and cutting mechanism, the splicer cover and the thread feed are generally driven via a cam disc drive. In other words, a cam disc package, which is connected, for example, via a plug coupling to a dedicated winding head drive, is mounted in a splicer drive housing. The individual cam discs are connected in turn, in this case, via a lever linkage to the aforementioned functional elements of the thread splicing device.<br>
Furthermore, thread splicing devices, which are driven by a single motor are also known from DE 196 10 818 Al or DE 199 21 855 Al. These known thread splicing devices have, inside the splicer drive housing, a groove drum, which has a plurality of differently configured groove paths and is driven by a reciprocating stepping motor. Control cams are guided in each case in the groove paths and actuate, via corresponding linkage arrangements, the functional elements of the thread splicing device, for example the splicer cover and the thread cutting and thread clamping mechanisms. The groove drum also has a groove path, which is equipped on part of its periphery with separate path sections for the forward and return motion. A valve<br>
which supplies the preparation tubes with air is activated via this very complex<br>
3<br><br>
groove path. Furthermore, the groove drum has a groove path for actuating the thread feed. This groove path has a partially step-shaped course and, in conjunction with a special lever linkage, allows a defined adjustment of the pivoting path of the thread feed. In other words, to adjust the pivoting path of the thread feed, the stepping motor rotates a specific number of steps forward and in the process rotates the groove drum into an angle position in which a roller bolt on the actuating linkage for the thread feed corresponds with a specific, predeterminable stage of the groove path.<br>
The above-described, known thread splicing device is very complex with regard to its design structure and not least very expensive to produce because of its relatively complex groove drum.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on providing a thread splicing device, in which, on the one hand, a variable remote adjustment of the pivoting path of the thread feed is possible and which, on the other hand, has manufacturing costs which are clearly below those of the known thread splicing devices.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a thread splicing device as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The configuration of a thread splicing device according to the invention with a control element, which is configured as a pivotably mounted control segment, the outer teeth of which mesh with a drive pinion of a single drive, which can be activated in a defined manner, in this case, in particular, provides the advantage, that the drive torque of the single drive is transmitted directly and virtually without play to the functional elements of the thread splicing device. In other words, the<br>
4<br><br>
movement course of the functional elements can be interrupted if necessary precisely in any position, preferably to carry out a further work operation for an adjustable time period and then be precisely continued, as the embodiment according to the invention, as indicated above, operates virtually without play. The thread splicing device according to the invention is also, in this case, in particular in relation to its drive mechanism, relatively simple with regard to its design structure and can therefore be produced economically.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment that at least the thread clamping and cutting mechanism and the thread feed are connected to the control segment via actuating elements. The use of a large number of components, which have already proven successful in the known thread splicing mechanism, is thus made possible in the production of thread splicing mechanisms according to the invention.<br>
The control segment, as described in claim 2 is, in this case, advantageously directly connected to the thread feed via a control linkage and connected via a pivot shaft, which is also used as a bearing pin, so as to be rotationally engaged to a lever, which, via a connecting lug, actuates the thread clamping and cutting mechanism. In a configuration of this type, the number of force transmission members interposed between the drive motor and functional elements is minimized and this is not only economical, but also has a positive effect on the total play of the force transmission.<br>
These advantages also relate to the embodiment described in claim 4. In this advantageous embodiment, a lever is connected to the control segment via a first fastening means, via which lever the thread clamping and cutting mechanism is actuated and also, at a certain radial spacing from the bearing pin of the control segment, a further articulation means, to which the thread feed is connected. A basic adjustment of the operating path of the thread feed is provided in this case via the<br>
5<br><br>
radial spacing of the further articulation means and can be steplessly adjusted by corresponding positioning of the control segment.<br>
As shown in claim 5, the thread splicing device in a preferred embodiment not only has thread clamping and cutting mechanisms and a thread feed, but also a pivotably mounted cover element which closes the splicing channel during the splicing process. This cover element is also actuated by the control segment.<br>
In other words, the control segment is preferably connected, as described in claims 6 and 7 via a connection bolt to a lever mechanism, which is rotatably mounted on the same bearing pin as the control segment. The lever mechanism, a construction which is known per se and has proven successful, consists in this case of a first lever, which is directly fixed to the control segment and connected via a connecting lug to the thread clamping and cutting mechanism, and of a second lever which is frictionally engaged via a spring element and to which the cover element is articulated via a short lug. This means that the thread clamping and cutting mechanism and the cover element are simultaneously actuated via the lever mechanism when the control segment is pivoted, with it being ensured by the interposed spring element that once the cover element has been placed on the splicing prism no damage of the components involved occurs nor is the further pivoting movement of the control segment impeded in any way.<br>
As shown in claims 8 and 9, the thread feed is also connected to the control segment via a corresponding control linkage. The control segment, for this purpose, has a ball-and-socket joint connection at its periphery. By corresponding pivoting of the control segment, the operating path of the thread feed can be adjusted in a defined manner and, if necessary, be adapted to given yarn parameters. In other words, by shortening or lengthening the pivoting path of the control segment, the operating path of the thread feed can easily be changed and therefore the overlapping length<br>
6<br><br>
of the thread ends to be positioned in the splicing channel adjusted in a defined manner.<br>
The thread splicing devices described in claims 10 and 11 are further alternative embodiments to the particularly advantageous embodiment of a thread splicing device shown in Figs. 1 to 6. The embodiments described in claims 10 and 11 are also a significant improvement compared to the previously known thread splicing devices, not least with regard to the manufacturing costs.<br>

A textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins characterised as a whole by the reference numeral 1, in the embodiment an automatic cross-winding machine, is shown schematically in a lateral view in Fig. 1.<br>
As known, automatic cross-winding machines of this type have, between their end frames (not shown), a large number of similar workstations, in the present case, winding heads 2. At these winding heads 2, spinning cops 9, which were produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown), are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15 which, after their production, are transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit (also not shown) to a cross-wound bobbin transporting mechanism 21 along the length of the machine.<br>
In the embodiment, the automatic cross-winding machine 1 also has a logistics mechanism dedicated to the machine in the form of a cop and tube transporting system 3. Spinning cops 9 or empty tubes, positioned on transporting plates 8 in a vertical orientation, circulate in this cop and rube transporting system 3, of which only the cop supply section 4, the reciprocally drivable storage section 5, a transverse transporting section 6 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 7 are shown in Fig. 1. The spinning cops 9 delivered are, in this case, rewound in the unwinding position AS, which is located in each case in the region of the transverse transporting section 6 at the winding heads 2, to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15.<br>
8<br><br>
The individual winding heads have, for this purpose, as known and therefore only indicated, various mechanisms, which ensure proper operation of these workstations.<br>
These mechanisms are, for example, a winding head computer 29, a suction nozzle 12 which can be loaded with a vacuum and is movable about a pivot pin 16, a gripper tube 11 which can be loaded with a vacuum and is movable about a pivot pin 13 and a pneumatic thread splicing device 10.<br>
The pneumatic thread splicing device 10 is, as indicated in Fig. 1, slightly set back with regard to the regular thread course and fixed with its central housing 31 on the winding head housing 33. Thread splicing devices 10 of this type, as explained below in more detail with the aid of Figs. 2 to 6 and 7, in addition to a splicing prism 32 with a pneumatically loadable splicing channel, also have an upper and a lower thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23, a pivotably mounted thread feed 26 and a pivotably mounted cover element 25. The splicing prism 32 is in turn arranged on a distributor block 46, into which the holding and opening tubes (not shown) are let.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin 15 is freely rotatably held during the winding process in the creel 28 of a winding device 24 and, in this case, rests with its surface on a groove drum 14, which entrains the cross-wound bobbin 15 via frictional engagement and also ensures proper traversing of the thread running onto the cross-wound bobbin 15.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment of a thread splicing device 10 according to the invention. An electric motor drive, preferably a stepping motor 22, is arranged inside the central housing 31 and its drive pinion 20 meshes with the outer teeth 19 of a control segment 18.<br>
9<br><br>
The control segment 18 is mounted so as to be rotatable to a limited extent on a bearing shaft 17 and connected via fastening means 30 to a lever mechanism 35, which is also arranged on the bearing pin 17. The lever mechanism 35 in this case consists of a first lever 38, to which a connecting lug 47 is connected via a connecting pin 36 to actuate the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23 (see also Fig. 5) and of a second lever 39, which, as can be seen in particular in Fig. 4, is connected to the cover element 25 via a lug 48. Connected in this case between the two levers 38, 39 is a spring element 37, which when the control segment 18 is pivoted, frictionally entrains the lever 39 via the lever 38. The spring element 37, in this case prevents, on the one hand, damage being able to occur at the thread splicing device owing to early placing of the cover element 25 on the splicing prism 32 with simultaneous further pivoting of the control segment 18 and, on the other hand, in conjunction with a corresponding configuration of the thread clamping and cutting mechanism, allows a large pivoting path of the control segment 18. The control segment 18, in the region of its periphery 40, has a second articulation means, preferably in the form of a ball-and-socket joint connection 34. A control linkage 44 of the thread feed 26 is connected to this ball-and-socket connection 34 (see also Fig. 6).<br>
Fig. 7 shows a first alternative embodiment of the thread splicing device according to the invention.<br>
As can be seen, a control segment 18 is mounted so as to be rotatable to a limited extent in the central housing 31 of this thread splicing device 10, preferably behind a covering 49. The control segment 18 which is pivotable about a bearing pin 27 has outer teeth 19, in which a drive pinion 20 of a single drive preferably configured as a stepping motor 22 engages. The control segment 18 has a connection flange 45 with a ball-and-socket joint connection 51, which is connected via an actuating linkage 41 and a further ball-and-socket joint connection 53 to a control contour 42 which is pivotably mounted on a bearing pin 17 and which is in turn connected via a connection bolt 52 to a lever mechanism 35. The lever mechanism 35 in this case<br>
10<br><br>
corresponds to the lever mechanism described in conjunction with the embodiment of Figs. 2 to 6. Apart from the ball-and-socket joint connection 53, the control contour 42, to connect the actuating linkage 41, also has the ball-and-socket joint connection 54, on which the linkage 43 engages, via which the thread feed 26 is actuated.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a further alternative embodiment of the thread splicing device according to the invention. As can be seen, the control segment 18 is also mounted here so as to be rotatable to a limited extent in the central housing 31 of the thread splicing device 10 and has outer teeth 19, in which a drive pinion 20 of a single drive preferably configured as a stepping motor 22 engages.<br>
The control segment 18 is, in this case, a component of a y-shaped lever element 59, which is pivotably mounted on a bearing pin 55.<br>
The lever parts of the lever element 59 opposing the control segment 18 are configured as a thread feed 26. In other words, the control segment 18 and the thread feed 26 form a common component which is pivotably mounted about the bearing pin 55.<br>
The thread clamping and cutting mechanisms 23 are connected to the lever element 56 via connection means 57 and actuating elements 47. The cover element 25 is also pivotably mounted on the bearing pin 55 and closes the splicing channel in the splicing prism 32 during the splicing process. The cover element 25 is, in this case, connected to the lever element 59 via a spring element 37.<br>
The function of the thread splicing device according to the invention is described by the example of the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 6:<br>
When a thread breakage has occurred at a winding head 2 or a controlled clearer cut has been carried out because of a thread defect, the suction nozzle 12 retrieves the<br>
11<br><br>
upper thread from the cross-wound bobbin 15 and threads it with the aid of the guide plate 50 into the upper thread clamping mechanism of the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23, the splicing channel in the splicing prism 32 and the lower thread cutting mechanism of the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23.<br>
Simultaneously or virtually simultaneously, the lower thread is also brought by the gripper tube 11 and also positioned with the aid of a thread guide plate 50 in the lower thread clamping mechanism, the splicing channel and in the upper thread cutting mechanism of the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23.<br>
The thread splicing device 10 is then activated via the winding head computer 29. In other words, the stepping motor 22 begins to pivot the control segment 18, as indicated in Fig. 2, in the direction R and in the process the cover element 25, the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23 and the thread feed 26 are actuated. This means that after a short time the cover element 25 is placed on the splicing prism 32 and covers the splicing channel. The further pivoting control segment 18 simultaneously or shortly thereafter actuates the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23, which clamps and cuts to length the thread ends, via the connecting lug 47. Thereupon, the control segment 18 is briefly stopped and the holding and opening tubes (not shown) arranged in the distributor block 46 of the splicing prism 32 are loaded with compressed air in such a way that the thread ends are sucked into the holding and opening tubes and are very substantially freed of their rotation there. The control segment 18 is now pivoted further by the stepping motor 22 and, via the control linkage 44, actuates the thread feed 26, which pulls out the prepared thread ends from the holding and opening tubes and positions them in the splicing channel of the splicing prism 32 with a predeterminable overlap. In other words, the thread feed 26, the arms of which in each case engage in the thread strand of the upper thread or lower thread on the side opposing the associated holding and opening tube in such a way that a thread loop is produced, is activated via the control segment 18 or the stepping motor 22 in such a way that the thread ends are<br>
12<br><br>
drawn from the holding and opening tubes in the direction of the splicing channel 20. The thread feed 26 is pivoted in this case until the thread ends drawn back into the splicing channel have a predetermined, optimal overlap, which was adjusted, for example, at the beginning of a batch change at a central control unit of the automatic cross-winding machine 1.<br>
When the thread ends have reached this optimal overlap, which depends on the different yarn parameters, for example on the yarn material or the yarn number, splicing air is provided on the splicing channel closed by the cover element 25 and the thread ends position inside the splicing channel are pneumatically intermingled.<br>
The control segment 18 is then pivoted back into its starting position by the stepping motor 22. The control segment 18 in this case, opens the thread clamping and cutting mechanism 23 and the cover element 25 so the pneumatically connected thread is released.<br>
The winding process can then be restarted.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to a thread splicing device comprising a splicing prism with a splicing channel, to which pneumatic pressure can be applied, in addition to a control element that can be driven by an individual motor. At least one thread tensioning and cutting unit for fixing and severing the thread ends that are to be spliced and a thread feed for positioning the prepared thread ends in the splicing channel are connected to the control element by means of actuating elements. According to the invention, the control element consists of a pivotally mounted control element (18) comprising external gearing (19), which meshes with a drive pinion (20) of an individual drive (22) that can be controlled in a defined manner and the actuating elements (47, 44) for the thread tensioning and cutting unit (23) and the thread feed (26) are rotationally fixed to the control segment (18).<br>
