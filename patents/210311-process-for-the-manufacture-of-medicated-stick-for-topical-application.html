COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF MEDICATED STICK FOR TOPICAL<br>
APPLICATION<br>
M/S. CIPLA LIMITED, MUMBAI CENTRAL, MUMBAI-400 008, MAHARASHTRA, India, an Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention, and the manner in which it is to be performed.         GRANTED<br>
26-7-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to the method/process for the manufacture of medicated sticks for topical application to human skin. The composition can contain either of the following bulk drugs as the active ingredient:- Didofenac or a salt thereof (particularly sodium) / Acyclovir or a salt thereof (particularly sodium), Mometasone or a salt thereof, Beclomethasoneora salt of thereof (particularly dipropionate) /Fluticasone or a salt thereof (particularly propionate), Betamethasone or a salt thereof (particularly dipropionate), menthol methyl salicytate and/or cyclosporin.<br>
In the manufacture of medicated sticks , problems have arisen when it has been necessary to store these sticks prior to sale or use. In particular, shrinkage due to loss of volatile ingredients often occurred resulting in the sticks becoming mishappened and brittle as they dry out. In the case where medicated sticks were prepared as transparent sticks, a further problem was that these sticks often became opaque with storage and consequently tansparent sticks have generally been commercially unavailable.<br>
It has been proposed in US Patent, inventor Ronald Smith, to use alkoxylated compounds in sodium stearate stick compositions which were alkaline in nature having a pH from 7.5 to 9.5. These stick compositions did not tend to exhibit desirable transparency and often became cloudy or hazy on storage. Furthermore, the compositions were generally unstable and became mishappened and showed browning on storage.<br>
It has also been proposed in Japanese Patent Kokai No.49/85250 of Tombo Pencil Co., to provide solid perfumery products in the form of a stick containing a sorbitol/benzaldehyde condensation product, ethanol water and propylene glycol, in addition to a substantial amount of perfume. This Japanese patent also described replacement of propylene glycol with glycerol together with hydroxypropylcellulose which is incorporated as a hardener.<br>
These products proposed by the Tombo Pencil Co., were however unsatisfactory, in that they showed a tendency to shrink and deform due to evaporative loss of ethanol. Furthermore, the presence of an excessively high level of ethanol could also provoke a stinging sensation when the stick was applied topically to human skin, and could lead to defatting and dehydration of the skin. These properties render the product unsatisfactory and unacceptable for normal use.<br>
US patent 4 518 582 (American Cyanamid Co) describes antiperspirant stick compositions containing dibenzylidene monosorbitol acetal in the presence of an acidic antiperspirant active salt, such as aluminium, chlorohydrex, together with 1,3-butytene glycol, anhydrous ethanol, hydroxypropyl cellulose and other!<br><br>
ingredients. Sticks such as these, however, lost their stability if water was present, because of hydrolysis of the dibenzylidene monosorbitol acetal in the presence of the acid antiperspirant salt. Such sticks containing antiperspirant actives can also be cosmetically unacceptable inthat they can become sticky following topical application, and they can be rejected by the consumer interfering with the body"s natural function of sweating in response to excessive heat or exercise.<br>
European Patent 0044, 543 describes the cutaneous route of administration of a number of acyclovir formulations suitable for skin ^ppJication as aqueous cream are in particular oil/water emulsions. However, these and other formulations such as for instance those described in WO 95/16434 and WO 94/05258 are inconvenient for application since dosage for treating herpes and in particular" herpes labialis with acyclovir includes several and frequent applications of the topical formulation, especially in the early stages of development of herpes. This causes patients to have the formulation constantly at hand throughout the day, atleast during the first few weeks of treatment.<br>
We have now found that the hitherto expereinced problems can be .alleviated by the use of specific amounts of ingredients suitable for use in compositions for topical administration and in particular medicated sticks.<br>
There is provided by the present invention method of preparing pharmaceutical composition of a medicated stick which comprises of an active ingredient; 10 to 90 % by weight of a solvent comprising one or more polyhydric alcohols; 0.5 to 5% by weight of dibenzylidene sorbitol; 0.5 to 1 % by weight of a thickening agent comprising one or more chemically modified cellulose"s, polyacrylic acids and polyacrylic acid copolymers ; 0 to60% by weight of a monohydrie alkanol, if used chosen from C1 to C6 monohydrie alkanols; and 0 to 20% by weight of water; provided that the total amount of solvent and water, if used comprise atleast 85% by weight of the composition.<br>
The active Ingredient typically comprises one or more of Diclofenac or a salt thereof (particularly sodium) / Acyclovir or a salt thereof (particularly sodium), Mometasone or a salt thereof, Beclomethasone or a salt thereof (partiGuJarly dipropionate) / Fluticasone or a salt thereof (particularly propionate), Betamethasone or a salt thereof (particularly dipropionate), menthol methyl salicytate and/or cyclosporin.<br>
More particularly, the active ingredient is typically selected from the group consisting of 0.5 to 3% by weight (particularly about 1 %) Diclofenac or a salt thereof (particularly sodium), 1 to 10 % by weight (particularly 5%) of Acycloviror a salt thereof (particularly sodium), 0.025 to 1% by weight (particularly 0.1%)<br><br><br>
Mometasone, or a salt thereof, 0.025 to 1% by weight (particularly about 0.025% ) Beclomethasone or a salt thereof (particularly dipropionate), 0.025 to 1 % by weight (particularly about 0.05%) Fluticasone (particularly propionate), or a salt thereof, 0.025 to 1 % by weight (particularly about 0.5% ) Betamethasone or a salt thereof (particularly dipropionate), 2 to 10 % by weight (particularly 5.91 %) menthol, 2 to 25 % by weight (particularly about 12.8 %) methyl salicytate and 0.25 to 3 % by weight cyclosporin.<br>
A composition according to the present invention is in the form of a medicated stick that can be applied to the affected area directly. Such a composition has good local action and on application gives a thin layer on the skin that is non -greasy. Compositions according to the invention in medicated stick form are extremely practical to use and are also very effective particularly when compared to conventional creams or fatty ointments. The ease of use of compositions according to the invention leads to a more frequent and correct application of the active ingredient to the area involved and, as a result, to a more effective treatment of the disease.<br>
Polyhydric alcohols are generally employed in compositions according to the present invention as a solvent for dibenzylidene sorbitol. The polyhydric alcohols can also enhance the stability of the compoisitions by avoiding as far as possible the problems of shrinkage, deformity and brittleness that can occur due to evaporative loss of volatile materials, such as monohydric alcohol, present in the compositions. Examples of suitable polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG) with medium molecular weight typically lower than 1000 (e.g. between PEG 200 and 600), propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycol, octyl dodecanol, and dipropyleneglycolmonomethyl ether. Preferred polyhydric alcohols include dipropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol, i.e., PEG 200 and mixtures thereof. The amount of polyhydric alcohol present in the compositions according to the invention is preferably in-the range of 30 to 90% by weight of the composition.<br>
A metod of preparing a composition according to the invention suitably comprises water in an amount, of 5 to 20% by weight of the composition. The inclusion of water in compositions according to the present invention is advantageous in increasing the hardness and improving the dissolution of thickening agents like hydroxypropyl cellulose also present in the compositions.<br>
Dibenzylidene Sorbitol present in compositions according to the invention can advantageously provide structural rigidity without impairing transparency of the medicated sticks. The amount of dibenzylidene sorbitol present in the medicated sticks according to the invention is preferably from about 1 to 2.5% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
Examples of chemically modified cellulose"s suitable for use as a thickening agent in compositions according to the invention include hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and methylcellulose. The preferred thickening agent is hydropropylcellulose (HPC-M).<br>
Monohydric alkanols present in the compositions according to the invention can further assist in dissolving dibenzylidene sorbitol present in the compositions. Examples of C1 to C6 monohydric alkanols are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, 1-butanol, n-pentanol, isopentanol, t-pentanol, n-hexanol. The preferred monohydric alkanol is ethanol which is commonly available as Industrial Methylated Spirits. The amount of the monohydric alkanol when present in the medicated stick according to the invention is preferably from 10to 30% by weight of the stick.<br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can also further comprise dissolution aids such as butyrolactone, propylene carbonate or pyrrolidone to aid the dissolution of the dibenzylidene sorbitol in the solvent, particularly when monohydric alkanols are absent or only a very low level of monohydric alkanols are present or when low level or when volatile monohydric alkanols (such as methanol or acetone-*) are employed.<br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can also further comprise one or more emollient oils to enhance the appeal of the composition. Examples of suitable emollient oils include isopropyl myristate, n-butyl phthalate, polyethyleneglycol 400, oleyl alcohol, as well as synthetic oils such as PPG-14 butyl ether (such as Fluid AP), Neobic A-20, PPG-5-Ceteth-20 (such as Procetyl AWS), PPG-3 Myristyl ether (such as Witconol APM) as well as lanolin, its alcohol"s and its esters.<br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can further comprise a humectant such as sorbitol or the like.<br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can also further comprise a cooling agent, such as menthol, or derivatives thereof or the like.<br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can also further comprise one or more permeation enhancers like diethylene glycol monoethylether (transcutol), oleic acid, sodium oleate, oleoyl macrogol-6 glycerides or PEG-8 glyceryl linoleate or the like.<br><br><br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can also further comprise one or more preservatives like methyl paraben, propyl paraben or the like.<br>
A method of preparing a composition according to the invention can alsofurther comprise one or more antioxidants like sodium metabisulfite or the like, to assist the stability of an active ingredient present in the composition.<br>
The choice of optional ingredients and the quantities employed should be such that the transparency, if required, of thisstick is not impaired.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process / method for preparing the medicated stick for topical application which process comprises of the following steps:-      <br>
forming a solution of dibenzylidene sorbitol in a solvent comprising one or more polyhydric alcohols;<br>
forming a mixture by adding to the solution formed in step (a) an active ingredient, a thickening agent comprising one or more chemically modified celluloses, polyacrylic acids and polyacrylic acid copolymers, a monohydric C1-6 alcohol and water; wherein the resulting composition comprises 10 to 90% by weight of the solvent, 0.5 to 5% by weight of dibenzylidene sorbitol, 0.5 to 1 % by weight of the thickening agent, 0-to 60% by weight of the monohydric C1-6 alcohol and 0 to 20% by weight of water; provided that the total amount of solvent and water together comprise at least 85% by weight of the composition.<br>
Suitably the solution obtained by step (a) is formed at a temperature of 85 to 90°C with stirring and preferably the active ingredient is then added thereto a temperature in the range of 70 to 80°C, such as about 75°C.<br>
According to a particular aspect of the invention a solution of the active ingredient is formed prior to addition thereof to the solution formed in step (a). According to an alternative aspect of the invention,-however., the active ingredient can be directly added to the solution formed in step (a) without any prior solution of the active ingredient.<br>
According to the present invention, the mixture formed in step (b) is formed into a medicated stick, for example by cooling it and casting it into a mould.<br>
Suitably a process according to the present invention can further comprise adding to the solution formed in step (a) one or more of an emollient oil, a humectant, a cooling agent, a permeation enhancer, a preservative and an antioxidant substantially as herein before described.<br><br><br>
A medicated stick obtained according to the present invention can be packed in a suitable holder with a removable cap to protect the stick and prevent the loss of any volatile ingredient therefrom.<br>
