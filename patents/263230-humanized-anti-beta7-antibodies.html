This is a non-provisional application filed under 37 CFR § 1.53(b)(l), chiming priority under 35<br>
U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/607,377, filed September 3, 2004, the<br>
entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to the fields of molecular biology and growth factor<br>
regulation. More specifically, the invention concerns modulators of the biological activity of integrins<br>
containing the beta? subunit, and uses of said modulators.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The integrins areα/ß heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in numerous cellular<br>
processes from cell adhesion to gene regulation (Hynes, R.O., Cell, 1992, 69:11 -25; and Hemler,<br>
M.E., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 1990, 8:365-368). Several integrins have been implicated in disease<br>
processes and have generated widespread interest as potential targets for drug discovery (Sharar,<br>
S.R. et al., Springer Semin. Immunopathol., 1995, 16:359-378). In the immune system, integrins are<br>
involved in leukocyte trafficking, adhesion and infiltration during infammatory processes<br>
(Nakajima, H. et al., J. Exp. Med., 1994, 179:1145-1154). Differential expression of integrins<br>
regulates the adhesive properties of cells and different integrins are involved in different<br>
inflammatory responses. Butcher, E.G. et al., Science, 1996, 272:60-66. The beta? integrins (i.e.<br>
alpha4beta7 (a4(37) and alphaEbeta? (αEß7)) are expressed primarily on monocytes, lymphocytes,<br>
eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages but not on neutrophils. Elices, M.J. et al., Cell, 1990,<br>
60:577-584. The primary ligands for a4(37 integrin are the endothelial surface proteins mucosal<br>
addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1)<br>
(Makarem, R. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269:4005-4011). The binding of the α4ß7 to MAdCAM<br>
and/or VCAM expressed on high endothelial venules (HEVs) at sites of inflammation results in firm<br>
adhesion of the leukocyte to the endothelium followed by extravasation into the inflamed tissue<br>
(Chuluyan, H.E. et al., Springer Semin. Immunopathol., 1995, 16:391-404). A primary ligand for<br>
αEß37 integrin is the intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) surface protein, E-cadherein, which facilitates<br>
adherence of the αEß7-bearing cell to epithelial lymphocytes. Monoclonal antibodies directed<br>
against α4ß7, MAdCAM or VCAM have been shown to be effective modulators in animalmodels<br>
of chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma (Laberge, S. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.,<br>
1995, 151:822-829.), rheumatoid arthritis (RA; Barbadillo, C. et al., Springer Semin.<br>
Immunopathol., 1995, 16:375-379), colitis (Vineyetal,J. Immunol., 1996, 157: 2488-2497) and<br>
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Podalski, D.K., N. Eng. J. Med., 1991, 325:928-937; Powrie, F.<br>
et al., Ther. Immunol., 1995, 2:115-123). Monoclonal antibodies directed against beta? subunit<br>
have been shown to bind the integrin subunit (Tidswell, M. et al. (1997) J. Immunol. 159:1497-<br>
1505) but as non-human or non-humanized antibodies, they lack clinical usefulness.<br>
A need exists for highly specific compounds, such as humanized antibodies or binding<br>
fragments thereof which inhibit the interaction between the alpha4beta7 integrin and its ligands<br>
MAdCAM and/or VCAM as well as the interaction between the alphaEbeta7 integrin and its ligand<br>
E-cadherin. These compounds are useful for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as<br>
asthma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, complications of organ transplantation, and<br>
allograft-related disorders.<br>
All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is in part based on the identification of a variety of antagonists of biological<br>
pathways involving beta7-containing integrins, which are generally biological/cellular processes that<br>
presents as an important and advantageous therapeutic target. Such biological pathways include,<br>
without limitation, inflammation, particularly chronic inflammation disorders such as asthma,<br>
allergy, IBD, diabetes, transplantation and grafts versus host disorders. The invention provides<br>
compositions and methods based on interfering with beta7 integrin-mediated cellular adhesion<br>
and/or recruitment, including but not limited to inferfering with MAdCAM and VCAM-1 binding to<br>
the extracellular portion of alpha4beta7 integrin and E-cadherin interaction with the alphaEbeta7<br>
integrin intereaction.. Antagonists of the invention, as described herein, provide important<br>
therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with<br>
abnormal or unwanted signaling via a beta? integrin. Accordingly, the invention provides methods,<br>
compositions, kits and articles of manufacture related to modulating beta7 integrin-mediated<br>
pathways, including modulation of MAdCAM-alpha4beta7 binding and leukocyte recruitment to<br>
gastrointestinal epithelium, binding and allergy, asthma, IBD (such as Crohn's disease and<br>
ulcerative colitis), diabetes, inflammation associated with transplantation, graft versus host disorder<br>
and/or allograft disorders and other biological/physiological activities mediated by beta7 integrin.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides anti-beta7 therapeutic agents suitable for therapeutic<br>
use and capable of effecting varying degrees of disruption of a beta7 integrin-mediated pathway.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the invention provides a humanized anti-beta7 antibody wherein<br>
the antibody as a Fab fragment has substantially the same binding affinity to human beta? as a<br>
murine Fab fragment comprising, consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy<br>
chain variable domain sequence as depicted in Figs. 1A and IB or Fig. 9A and 9B. In another<br>
embodiment, the invention provides a humanized anti-beta7 antibody wherein the antibody as a Fab<br>
fragment has a binding affinity to human beta7 that is lower, for example at least 3, at least 5, at<br>
least 7 or at least 10-fold lower, than that of a murine or rat Fab fragment comprising, consisting or<br>
consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in Fig.<br>
1A and IB or the variable domain sequences depicted in Figs. 9A and 9B Alternatively, a<br>
humanized anti-beta? antibody, or beta7 binding fragment thereof, of the invention exhibits<br>
monovalent affinity to human beta7, which affinity is substantially the same as or greater than<br>
monovalent affinity to human beta7 of an antibody comprising light chain and heavy chain variable<br>
sequences as depicted in Fig. 1A (SEQ ID NO: 10) and/or Fig. IB (SEQ ID NO:11), or Fig. 9A<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 12) and/or Fig. 9B (SEQ ID NO: 13). The antibody or binding fragment thereof having<br>
great affinity to human beta? exhibits an affinity which is at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-<br>
fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, at least 500-fold, at least 1000-fold, at least 5000-fold, or at<br>
least 10,000-fold greater than an antibody comprising the light chain and heavy chain sequences<br>
depicted in Fig. 1A (SEQ ID NO: 10) and/or Fig. IB (SEQ ID NO:11), or Fig. 9A (SEQ ID NO: 12)<br>
and/or Fig. 9B (SEQ ID NO: 13).<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an anti-beta7 humanized antibody wherein<br>
the antibody as a Fab fragment has a binding affinity to human beta? that is greater, for example at<br>
least 3, at least 5, at least 7, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, or at least 100-fold greater<br>
than that of a rodent (such as rat or murine) Fab fragment comprising, consisting or consisting<br>
essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in Fig. 1A and<br>
Fig. IB, respectively. In one embodiment, said rodent Fab fragment has the binding affinity of a<br>
Fab fragment comprising variable domain sequences of a rat antibody designated FIB504.64<br>
produced by hybridoma cell line deposited under American Type Culture Collection Accession<br>
Number ATCC HB-293. In a further embodiment, a humanized Fab fragment of the invention has<br>
the binding affinity of a Fab fragment comprising variable domain sequences of an antibody<br>
produced by anyone of the humanized anti-beta? antibodies of the invention. As is well-established<br>
in the art, binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor can be determined using any of a variety of<br>
assays, and expressed in terms of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly, in one embodiment,<br>
the binding affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity (e.g., with<br>
minimized avidity effects). Generally and preferably, binding affinity is measured in vitro, whether<br>
in a cell-free or cell-associated setting. As described in greater detail herein, fold difference in<br>
binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the binding affinity value of a humanized<br>
antibody in Fab form and the binding affinity value of a reference/comparator Fab antibody (e.g., a<br>
murine antibody having donor hypervariable region sequences), wherein the binding affinity values<br>
are determined under similar assay conditions. Thus, in one embodiment, the fold difference in<br>
binding affinity is determined as the ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form<br>
and said reference/comparator Fab antibody. Any of a number of assays known in the art, including<br>
those described herein, can be used to obtain binding affinity measurements, including, for example,<br>
Biacore® (Biacore International Ab, Uppsala, Sweden) and ELISA.<br>

A therapeutic agent for use in a host subject preferably elicits little to no immunogenic<br>
response against the agent in said subject. In one embodiment, the invention provides such an agent.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the invention provides a humanized antibody that elicits and/or is<br>
expected to elicit a human anti-rodent antibody response (such as anti-mouse or anti-rat response) or<br>
a human anti-human response at a substantially reduced level compared to an antibody comprising<br>
the sequence comprising SEQ ID N0s:10 and/or 11 (Figs. 1A and IB) or SEQ ID NOs: 12 and/or<br>
13 (Figs. 9A and 9B depicting rat anti-mouse Fib504 amino acid sequences) in a host subject. In<br>
another example, the invention provides a humanized antibody that elicits and/or is expected to elicit<br>
no human anti-rodent (such as human anti-mouse (HAMA) or human anti-mouse) or human antihuman<br>
antibody response (HAHA).<br>
A humanized antibody of the invention may comprise one or more human and/or human<br>
consensus non-hypervariable region (e.g., framework) sequences in its heavy and/or light chain<br>
variable domain. In some embodiments, one or more additional modifications are present within the<br>
human and/or human consensus non-hypervariable region sequences. In one embodiment, the heavy<br>
chain variable domain of an antibody of the invention comprises a human consensus framework<br>
sequence, which in one embodiment is the subgroup III consensus framework sequence. In one<br>

sequence modified at at least one amino acid position. For example, in one embodiment, a variant<br>
subgroup III consensus framework sequence may comprise a substitution at one or more of positions<br>
71,73, 78 and/or 94. In one embodiment, said substitution is R71A, N73T, L78A, and/or R94M, in<br>
any combination thereof.<br>
As is known in the art, and as described in greater detail hereinbelow, the amino acid<br>
position/boundary delineating a hypervanable region of an antibody can vary, depending on the<br>
context and the various definitions known in the art (as described below). Some positions within a<br>
variable domain may be viewed as hybrid hypervariable positions in that these positions can be<br>
deemed to be within a hypervariable region under one set of criteria while being deemed to be<br>
outside a hypervariable region under a different set of criteria. One or more of these positions can<br>
also be found in extended hypervariable regions (as further defined below). The invention provides<br>
antibodies comprising modifications in these hybrid hypervariable positions. In one embodiment,<br>
these hybrid hypervariable positions include one or more of positions 26-30, 33-35B, 47-49, 49, 57-<br>
65, 93, 94 and 102 in a heavy chain variable domain. In one embodiment, these hybrid<br>
hypervariable positions include one or more of positions 24-29,35-36, 46-49,49, 56 and 97 in a<br>
light chain variable domain. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises a variant<br>
human subgroup consensus framework sequence modified at one or more hybrid hypervariable<br>
positions. In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises a heavy chain variable<br>
domain comprising a variant human subgroup III consensus framework sequence modified at one or<br>
more of positions 28-35, 49,50, 52a, 53, 54, 58-61, 63, 65, 94 and 102. In one embodiment, the<br>

the substitutions at positions R71A or N73T or L78A or L78F. In one embodiment, the antibody<br>

the HVR-H1, HVR-H2, and/or HVR-H3 of the heavy chain.<br>
In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises alight chain variable domain<br>

substitutions are in the HVR-L1, HVR-L2, and/or HVR-L3 of the light chain.<br>
An antibody of the invention can comprise any suitable human or human consensus light<br>
chain framework sequences, provided the antibody exhibits the desired biological characteristics<br>
(e.g., a desired binding affinity). In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises at least<br>
a portion (or all) of the framework sequence of human K light chain. In one embodiment, an<br>
antibody of the invention comprises at least a portion (or all) of human K subgroup I framework<br>

In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises a heavy and/or light chain<br>
variable domain comprising framework sequences depicted SEQ ID NOS:34-41 and in FIGS 1, 7<br>
and 8, provided positions 49 of the light chain and 94 of the heavy chain are included in the<br>
extended HVRs, and provided said position 49 is K and said position 94 is preferably but not<br>
necessarily M and may be R.<br>
Antagonists of the invention can be used to modulate one or more aspects of beta?<br>
associated effects, including but not limited to association with alpha4 integrin subunit, association<br>
withalphaE integrin subunit, binding of alpha4beta? integrin to MAdCAM, VCAM-1 orfibronectin<br>
and binding of alphaEbeta? integrin to E-caderin. These effects can be modulated by any<br>
biologically relevant mechanism, including disruption of ligand binding to beta? subunit or to the<br>
alpha4beta? or alphaEbeta dimeric integrin, and/or by disrupting association between the alpha and<br>
beta integrin subunits such that formation of the dimeric integrin is inhibited. Accordingly, in one<br>
embodiment, the invention provides a beta? antagonist antibody that inhibits binding of alpha4to<br>
beta?. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention disrupts binding of<br>
alpha4beta? to MAdCAM. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention<br>
disrupts binding of alpha4beta? to VCAM-1. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the<br>
invention disrupts binding of alpha4beta? to fibronectin. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist<br>
antibody of the invention disrupts binding of beta? to alphaE. In one embodiment, a beta?<br>
antagonist antibody of the invention disrupts binding alphaEbeta? integrin to E-cadherin.<br>
Interference can be direct or indirect. For example, a beta? antagonist antibody may bind to beta?<br>
within a sequence of the alpha4beta? or alphaEbeta? dimerization region, and thereby inhibit<br>
19<br>
interaction of the integrin subunits and formation of an integrin dimer. hi a further example, a beta?<br>
antagonist antibody may bind to a sequence within the ligand binding domain of beta? subunit and<br>
thereby inhibit interaction of said bound domain with its binding partner (such as fibronectin,<br>
VCAM, and/or MAdCAM for the alpha4beta? integrin; or E-cadherin for the alphaEbeta? integrin).<br>
In another example, a beta? antagonist antibody may bind to a sequence that is not within the<br>
integrin subunit dimerization domain or a ligand binding domain, but wherein said beta? antagonist<br>
antibody binding results in disruption of the ability of the beta? domain to interact with its binding<br>
partner (such as an alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit and/or a ligand such as fibronectin, VCAM,<br>
MAdCAM, or E-cadherein). In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the in vention binds to<br>
beta? (for example, the extracellular domain) such that beta? dimerization with the alpha4 or alphaE<br>
subunit is disrupted. In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention binds to beta?<br>
such that ability of beta? and/or an alpha4beta? and/or an alphaEbeta? integrin to bind to its<br>
respective ligand or ligands is disrupted. For example, h one embodiment, the invention provides<br>
an antagonist antibody which upon binding to a beta? molecule inhibits dimerization of said<br>
molecule. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds a<br>
sequence in the ligand binding domain of beta?. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of<br>
the invention specifically binds a sequence in the ligand binding domain of beta? such that ligand<br>
binding (i.e., fibronectin, VCAM, and/or MAdCAM) to the alpha4beta? integrin is disrupted. In one<br>
embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds a sequence in the ligand<br>
binding domain of beta? such that ligand binding (i.e., E-cadherin) to the alphaEbeta? integrin is<br>
disrupted.<br>
In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention disrupts beta? dimerization<br>
comprising heterodimerization (i.e., beta? dimerization with an alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit<br>
molecule).<br>
In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention binds to an epitope on the beta?<br>
integrin subunit that maps to amino acids 176-237. In another embodiment, an antagonist antibody<br>
of the invention binds to the same epitope on the beta? integrin that is the substantially the same<br>
epitope as Fib504.64 (ATCC HB-293). Determination of epitope binding is by standard techniques<br>
including without limitation competition binding analysis.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides an antibody comprising a combination of one, two,<br>
three, four, five or all of the HVR sequences depicted in the table of amino acid substitutions in Fig.<br>
13.<br>
A therapeutic agent for use in a host subject preferably elicits little to no immunogenic<br>
response against the agent in said subject. In one embodiment, the invention provides such an agent.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the invention provides a humanized antibody that elicits and/or is<br>
expected to elicit a human anti-rat or human anti-mouse or human anti-human antibody response at<br>
a substantially reduced level compared to an antibody comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NOS :10,<br>
11, 12 and/or SEQ ID NO:13 (rat anti-mouse Fib504 (ATCC HB-293), FIGS. 1 and 9) in a host<br>
subject. In another example, the invention provides a humanized antibody that elicits and/or is<br>
expected to elicit no human anti-mouse, human anti-rat, or human anti-human antibody response.<br>
A humanized antibody of the invention may comprise one or more human and/or human<br>
consensus non-hypervariable region (e.g., framework) sequences in its heavy and/or light chain<br>
variable domain. In some embodiments, cne or more additional modifications are present within the<br>
human and/or human consensus non-hypervariable region sequences. In one embodiment, the heavy<br>
chain variable domain of an antibody of the invention comprises a human consensus framework<br>
sequence, which in one embodiment is the subgroup III consensus framework sequence. In one<br>
embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises a variant subgroup III consensus framework<br>
sequence modified at at least one amino acid position. For example, in one embodiment, a variant<br>
subgroup III consensus framework sequence may comprise a substitution at one or more of positions<br>
71, 73, 78 and/or 94, although position 94 is part of an extended heavy chain hypervariable region-<br>
H3 of the present invention. In one embodiment, said substitution is R71A, N73T, N78A, and/or<br>
R94M, in any combination thereof.<br>
An antibody of the invention can comprise any suitable human or human consensus light<br>
chain framework sequences, provided the antibody exhibits the desired biological characteristics<br>
(e.g., a desired binding affinity). In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention comprises at least<br>
a portion (or all) of the framework sequence of human K light chain. In one embodiment, an<br>
antibody of the invention comprises at least a portion (or all) of human K subgroup I framework<br>
consensus sequence.<br>
Antagonists of the invention can be used to modulate one or more aspects of beta7<br>
associated effects. For example, a beta7 antagonist antibody may bind to beta? within a sequence of<br>
the alpha4beta7 or alphaEbeta7 dimerization region, and thereby inhibit interaction of the integrin<br>
subunits and formation of an integrin dimer. In a further example, a beta7 antagonist antibody may<br>
bind to a sequence within the ligand binding domain of beta7 subunit and thereby inhibit interaction<br>
of said bound domain with its binding partner (such as fibronectin, VCAM, and/or MAdCAM for<br>
the alpha4beta7 integrin; or E-cadherin for the alphaEbeta? integrin). In another example, a beta?<br>
antagonist antibody may bind to a sequence that is not within the integrin subunit dimerization<br>
domain or a ligand binding domain, but wherein said beta? antagonist antibody binding results in<br>
disruption of the ability of the beta? domain to interact with its binding partner (such as an alpha4 or<br>
alphaE integrin subunit and/or a ligand such as fibronectin, VCAM, MAdCAM, or E-cadherein). In<br>
one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention binds to beta? (for example, the<br>
extracellular domain) such that beta? dimerization with the alpha4 or alphaE subunit is disrupted. In<br>
one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention binds to beta? such that ability of beta?<br>
and/or an alpha4beta7 and/or an alphaEbeta? integrin to bind to its respective ligand or ligands is<br>
disrupted. For example, in one embodiment, the invention provides an antagonist antibody which<br>
upon binding to a beta? molecule inhibits dimerization of said molecule. In one embodiment, a<br>
beta? antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds a sequence in the ligand binding<br>
domain of beta?. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds<br>
a sequence in the ligand binding domain of beta? such that ligand binding (i.e., fibronectin, VCAM,<br>
and/or MAdCAM) to the alpha4beta? integrin is disrupted. In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist<br>
antibody of the invention specifically binds a sequence in the ligand binding domain of beta? such<br>
that ligand binding (i.e., E-cadherin) to the alphaEbeta? integrin is disrupted.<br>
In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention disrupts beta? dimerization<br>
comprising heterodimerization (i.e., beta? dimerization with an alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit<br>
molecule.<br>
In some instances, it may be advantageous to have a beta? antagonist antibody that does not<br>
interfere with binding of a ligand (such as fibronectin, VCAM, MAdCAM, or alphaE) to beta?<br>
subunit as part of an integrin or to an alpha4beta? integrin or an alphaEbeta? integrin as a dimer.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, the inventfan provides an antibody that does not bind a<br>
fibronectin, VCAM, MAdCAM, or E-cadherin binding site on beta? but, instead, inhibits interaction<br>
between beta? subunit and an alpha subunit (such as alpha4 or alphaE integrin subunit) such that a<br>
biologically active integrin is prevented from forming. In one example, an antagonist antibody of<br>
the invention can be used in conjunction with one or more other antagonists, wherein the antagonists<br>
are targeted at different processes and/or functions within the beta? integrin axis. Thus, in one<br>
embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention binds to an epitope on beta? distinct from<br>
an epitope bound by another beta? or an alphatoeta integrin antagonist (such as an alpha4beta?<br>
antibody, including monoclonal antibody or an antibody, such as a humanized antibody or<br>
monoclonal antibody derived from and/or having the same or effectively the same binding<br>
characteristics or specificity as an antibody derived from a murine antibody.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a beta? antagonist antibody that disrupts beta?-<br>
alpha4 or-alphaE multimerization into the respective integrin as well as ligand binding. For<br>
example, an antagonist antibody of the invention that inhibits beta? dimerization with alpha4 or<br>
alphaE integrin subunit may further comprise an ability to compete with ligand for binding to beta?<br>
or the integrin dimer (e.g., it may interfere with the binding of fibronectin, VCAM, and/or<br>
MAdCAM to beta? and/or alpha4beta7; or it may interfere with the binding of E-cadherin to beta?<br>
or alphaEbeta?.)<br>
In one embodiment of a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention, binding of the<br>
antagonist to beta? inhibits ligand binding activated cellular adhesion. In another embodiment of a<br>
beta? antagonist antibody of the invention, binding of the antagonist to beta? hi a cell inhibits<br>
recruitment of the cell to the cells and/or tissue in which the beta?-containing integrin is expressed.<br>
In one embodiment, a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds at least a<br>
portion of amino acids 176-250 (optionally amino acids 176-237) of the beta? extracellular domain<br>
22<br>
(see Tidswell, M. et al. (1997) J. Immunol. 159:1497-1505) or variant thereof, and reduces or blocks<br>
binding of ligands MAdCAM, VCAM-1, fibronectin, and/or E-cadherin. In one embodiment, such<br>
blocking of ligand binding disrupts, reduces and/or prevents adhesion of a cell expressing the ligand<br>
to a cell expressing the beta7-containing ligand. In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the<br>
invention specifically binds an amino acid sequence of beta7 comprising residues 176-237. In one<br>
embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds a conformational epitope<br>
formed by part or all of at least one of the sequences selected from the group consisting of residues<br>
176-237 of beta7. In one embodiment, an antagonist antibody of the invention specifically binds an<br>
amino acid sequence having at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at<br>
least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99% sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of<br>
residues 176-237 or residues 176-250 of human beta7. In one embodiment, the antagonist anti-beta7<br>
antibody of the invention binds the same epitope as the anti-beta7 antibody Fib504 produced by<br>
hybridoma ATCC HB-293.<br>
to one aspect, the invention provides compositions comprising one or more antagonist<br>
antibodies of the invention and a carrier. In one embodiment, the carrier is pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides nucleic acids encoding a beta7 antagonist antibody of<br>
the invention.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid of the invention.<br>
to one aspect, the invention provides host cells comprising a nucleic acid or a vector of the<br>
invention. A vector can be of any type, for example a recombinant vector such as an expression<br>
vector. Any of a variety of host cells can be used, to one embodiment, a host cell is a prokaryotic<br>
cell, for example, E. coli. In one embodiment, a host cell is a eukaryotic cell, for example a<br>
mammalian cell such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides methods for making an antagonist of the invention.<br>
For example, the invention provides a method of making a beta7 antagonist antibody (which, as<br>
defined herein includes full length and fragments thereof), said method comprising expressing in a<br>
suitable host cell a recombinant vector of the invention encoding said antibody (or fragment<br>
thereof), and recovering said antibody.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides an article of manufacture comprising a container; and a<br>
composition contained within the container, wherein the composition comprises one or more beta?<br>
antagonist antibodies of the invention. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a nucleic<br>
acid of the invention. In one embodiment, a composition comprising an antagonist antibody further<br>
comprises a carrier, which in some embodiments is pharmaceutically acceptable, to one<br>
embodiment, an article of manufacture of the invention further comprises instructions for<br>
administering the composition (for example, the antagonist antibody) to a subject.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a kit comprising a first container comprising a<br><br>
composition comprising one or more beta? antagonist antibodies of the invention; and a second<br>
container comprising a buffer. In one embodiment, the buffer is pharmaceutically acceptable. In<br>
one embodiment, a composition comprising an antagonist antibody further comprises a carrier,<br>
which in some embodiments is pharmaceutically acceptable. In one embodiment, a kit further<br>
comprises instructions for administering the composition (for example, the antagonist antibody) to a<br>
subject.<br>
Beta? integrins and their ligands are variously expressed in disease states. [The expression of<br>
MAdCAM- Ion gut endothelium is increased in sites of mucosal inflammation in patients with<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (UC and CD) and colonic lamina propria of UC and CD patients also<br>
show increased CD3+ and a4b?+ cells compared to IBS controls (see Souza H., et al., Gut 45:856<br>
(1999)). MAdCAM-1 expression was observed to be associated with portal tract inflammation in<br>
liver diseases and may be important in recruitment of alpha4beta7+ lymphocytes to the liver during<br>
inflammation. (Milan, K., et al., Liver. 19(6):509-18 (1999)) MAdCAM-1 on hepatic vessels<br>
supports adhesion of a4b7+ lymphocytes from patients with IBD and primary sclerosing cholangitis.<br>
The adhesion was inhibited by anti-MAdCAM-1, anti-alpha4beta7, or anti-alpha4 antibodies.<br>
(Grant AJ. etal., Hepatology. 33(5): 1065-72 (2001)). MAdCAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-cadherin are<br>
expressed on brain endothelial cells and/or on microvessels in the inflamed central nervous system.<br>
Beta? integrins contribute to demyelinating disease of the CNS (Kanwar et al., J. Neuroimmunology<br>
103. 146 (2000)). Expression of alpha4beta? was significantly higher in the LPL of CD than in<br>
controls and patients with UC (Oshitani, N. et al., International Journal of Molecule Medicine 12,<br>
715-719 (2003)). lELs from CD patients may be chronically stimulated and recruited from the<br>
periphery (Meresse, B., et al., Human Immunology, 62, 694-700 (2001)). In human liver disease,<br>
alphaEbeta? T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) are preferentially accumulated in human livers where Ecadherin<br>
is expressed on hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium (Shimizu, Y., et al., Journal of<br>
Hepatology 39,918-924 (2003)). In chronic pancreatitis, CD8+CD103+ T cells, analogous to<br>
intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, infiltra'e the pancreas in chronic pancreatitis (Matthias, P., et<br>
al., Am J Gastroenterol 93:2141-2147 (1998)). Upregulation of alphaEbeta? is found in systemic<br>
lupus erythematosus patients with specific epithelial involvement (Pang et al., Arthritis &amp;<br>
Rheumatism 41:1456-1463 (1998)). In Sjogren's Syndrome, CD8+ alphaEbeta?+ T cells adhere<br>
and kill acinar epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis (Kroneld et al., Scand J Rheumatol 27:215-<br>
218,1998) Integrin alpha4beta7 and alphaEbeta? play a role in T cell epidermotropism during skin<br>
inflammation and contribute to skin allograft rejection (Sun et al., Transplantation 74,1202, 2002).<br>
Teraki and Shiohara showed preferential expression of aEb? integrin on CD8+ T cells in psoriatic<br>
epidermis (Teraki and Shiohara, Br. J. Dermatology 147. 1118, 2002). Sputum T lymphocytes are<br>
activated lELs (CD69+ CD103+) in asthma, COPD, and normal subjects (Leckie et. al., Thorax 58,<br>
23,2003). CD103+ (aEb7+) CTL accumulate with graft epithelium during clincial renal allograft<br>
rejection (Hadley et al., Transplantation 72, 1548, 2001) JThus, in one aspect, the invention<br>
provides use of a beta? antagonist antibody of the invention to inhibit beta? integrin-ligand<br>
interaction to reduce or alleviate disease, such as one or more of the above described disease states.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention is used in the preparation of a medicament for the<br>
therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a disease, such as an inflammatory disease including<br>
without limitation inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis),<br>
inflammatory liver disease, inflammation of the CNS, chronic pancreatitis, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, psoriasis and skin inflammation, asthma, chronic obstructive<br>

of a medicament for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a disease, such as an immune<br>
(such as autoimmune or inflammatory) disorder including without limitation, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and allergic reaction (such as disorders of the<br>
respiratory system, skin, joints, allergic asthma and other organs affected by allergic reaction<br>
mediated by a beta7-containing integrin).<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides use of an expression vector of the invention in the<br>
preparation of a medicament for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a disease, such as<br>
an immune (such as autoimmune or inflammatory) disorder including without limitation,<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and allergic reaction<br>
(such as disorders of the respiratory system, skin, joints, and other organs affected by allergic<br>
reaction mediated by a beta7-containing integrin)..<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides use of a host cell of the invention in the preparation of<br>
a medicament for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a disease, such as an immune<br>
(such as autoimmune or inflammatory) disorder including without limitation, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and allergic reaction (such as disorders of the<br>
respiratory system, skin, joints, and other organs affected by allergic reaction mediated by a beta7-<br>
containing integrin)..<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides use of an article of manufacture of the invention in the<br>
preparation of a medicament for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a disease, such as<br>
an immune (such as autoimmune or inflammatory) disorder including without limitation,<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and allergic reaction<br>
(such as disorders of the respiratory system, skin, joints, and other organs affected by allergic<br>
reaction mediated by a betaT-containing integrin)..<br>
In one aspect, the invent ion provides use of a kit of the invention in the preparation of a<br>
medicament for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a disease, such as an immune (such<br>
as autoimmune or inflammatory) disorder including without limitation, inflammatory bowel disease<br>
(such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and allergic reaction (such as disorders of the<br>
25<br>
respiratory system, skin, joints, and other organs affected by allergic reaction mediated by a betaTcontaining<br>
integrin)..<br>
The invention provides methods and compositions useful for modulating disease states<br>
associated with dysregulation of the beta? integrin mediated cell-cell interaction process. The beta?<br>
integrins are involved in multiple biological and physiological functions, including, for example,<br>
inflammatory disorders and allergic reactions. Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides a method<br>
comprising administering to a subject an antibody of the invention.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting beta? integrin mediated<br>
inflammation, said method comprising contacting a cell or tissue with an effective amount of a<br>
antibody of the invention, whereby lymphocyte or B-cell interaction and binding to a beta? integrinexpressing<br>
cell is inhibited.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a pathological condition<br>
associated with dysregulation of beta? integrin binding in a subject, said method comprising<br>
administering to the subject an effective amount of an antibody of the invention, whereby said<br>
condition is treated.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the binding of a lymphocyte<br>
expressing a beta? integrin ligand (such as a cell expressing MAdCAM, VCAM, E-cadherein or<br>
fibronectin) to a cell that expresses beta? integrin (such as alpha4beta? or alphaEbeta? integrins),<br>
said method comprising contacting said cell with an antibody of the invention thereby inhibiting or<br>
preventing adhesion of the cells and causing a reduction of inflammatory reaction.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method for treating or preventing an inflammatory<br>
disorder associated with increased expression or activity of beta? integrin or increased interaction<br>
between a beta? integrin on one cell and a beta? integrin receptor on another cell, said method<br>
comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of an antibody<br>
of the invention, thereby effectively treating or preventing said inflammatory disorder. In one<br>
embodiment, said inflammatory disorder is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In another<br>
embodiment, said inflammatory disorder is an allergic reaction.<br>
Methods of the invention can be used to affect any suitable pathological state, for example,<br>
cells and/or tissues associated with dysregulation of the beta? integrin binding pathway. Beta?<br>
integrins are expressed primarily on leukocytes (Tidswell, M. et al. (1997) supra). In one<br>
embodiment, a leukocyte is targeted in a method of the invention and is prevented from binding to a<br>
cell expressing a ligand of the beta? integrin. For example, an an into- epithelial lymphocyte<br>
expressing E-cadherin is prevented, according to the invention, from binding to an alphaEbeta? -<br>
expressing cell by an antagonist anti-beta? antibody. Cells expressing MAdCAM, VCAM-1 or<br>
fibronectin are prevented by an antagonist anti-beta? antibody of the invention from binding to a<br>
leukocyte expressing alpha4beta7.<br>
Methods of the invention can further comprise additional treatment steps. For example, in<br>
one embodiment, a method further comprises a step wherein a targeted cell and/or tissue (for<br>
example, an endothelial cell of the intestinal lining) is exposed to an anti-TNF antibody or a small<br>
molecule therapeutic agent including without limitation 5-ASA compounds (including without<br>
limitation<br>
As described herein, beta? integrins mediate important biological processes the<br>
dysregulation of which leads to numerous pathological conditions. Accordingly, in one embodiment<br>
of methods of the invention, a cell that is targeted (for example, an endothelial cell) is one in which<br>
adhesion of a cell expressing a beta? integrin ligand of a beta? integrin (where the cell may be,<br>
without limitation, a lymphocyte, and the ligand may be MAdCAM, VCAM or E-cadherin) is<br>
disrapted, inhibited, or prevented as compared to the cells in the absence of the anti-beta? antagonist<br>
antibody of the invention. In one embodiment, a method of the invention inhibits lymphocyte<br>
homing, thereby inhibiting inflammation at the site of beta? integrin expression. For example,<br>
contact with an antagonist of the invention may result in a cell's inability to adhere to a cell<br>
expressing a ligand of a beta? integrin .<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides methods, compositions, kits and articles of manufacture for identifying<br>
and/or using inhibitors of the beta7 signaling pathway.<br>
Details of these methods, compositions, kits and articles of manufacture are provided herein.<br>
General Techniques<br>
The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional<br>
techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology,<br>
biochemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully<br>
in the literature, such as, "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", second edition (Sambrook et al.,<br>
1989); "Oligonucleotide Synthesis" (M. J. Gait, ed., 1984); "Animal Cell Culture" (R. I. Freshney, ed.,<br>
1987); "Methods in Enzymology" (Academic Press, Inc.); "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology" (F.<br>
M. Ausubel et al., eds., 1987, and periodic updates); "PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction", (Mullis et<br>
al., ed., 1994); "A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning" (Perbal Bernard V., 1988); "Phage Display: A<br>
Laboratory Manual" (Barbas et al., 2001).<br>
Definitions<br>
By "beta7 subunit" or "67 subunit" is meant the human 67 integrin subunit (Erie et al.,<br>
(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:11009-11016). The beta7 subunit associates with alpha4 intetrin subunit,<br>
such as the human a4 subunit (Kilger and Holzmann (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 73:347-354). The<br>
alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a majority of mature lymphocytes, as well as a small population<br>
of thymocytes, bone marrow cells and mast cells. (Kilshaw and Murant (1991) Eur. J. Immunol.<br>
21:2591-2597; Gurish et al., (1992) 149: 1964-1972; and Shaw, S.K. and Brenner, M.B. (1995)<br>
Semin. Immunol. 7:335). The beta7 subunit also associates with the alphaE subunit, such as the<br>
human alphaE integrin subunit (Cepek, K..L, et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 150:3459). The alphaEbeta7<br>
integrin is expressed on intra-intestinal epithelial lymphocytes (ilELs) (Cepek, K.L. (1993) supra).<br>
The beta7 subunit that binds to the humanized antibeta7 antibody of the invention may be naturally<br>
occurring and may be soluble or localized to the surface of a cell.<br>
By "alphaE subunit" or "alphaE integrin subunit" or 'txE subunit" or"aE integrin subunit"<br>
or "CD 103" is meant an integrin subunit found to be associated with beta? integrin on intraepithelial<br>
lymphocytes, which alphaEbeta7 integrin mediates binding of the iELs to intestinal<br>
epithelium expressing E-caderin (Cepek, K.L. et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 150:3459; Shaw, S.K. and<br>
Brenner, M.B. (1995) Semin. Immunol. 7:335).<br>
"MAdCAM" or "MAdCAM-1" are used interchangeably in the context of the present<br>
invention and refer to the protein mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, which is a single<br>
chain polypeptide comprising a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region and an extracellular<br>
sequence composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains. The cDNAs for murine, human and<br>
macaque MAdCAM-1 have been cloned (Briskh, et al, (1993) Nature, 363:461464; Shyjan et al.,<br>
(1996) J. Immunol. 156:2851-2857).<br>
"VCAM-1" or "vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1""CD106" refers to a ligand of<br>
alpha4beta7 and alpha4betal, expressed on activated endothelium and important in endothelialleukocyte<br>
interactions such as binding and transmigration of leukocytes during inflammation.<br>
"E-cadherin" refers to a member of the family of cadherins, where E-cadherin is expressed<br>
on epithelial cells. E-cadherin is a ligand of the alphaEbeta? integrin and mediates binding of iELexpressed<br>
alphaEbeta? to intestinal epithelium, although its function in lymphocyte homing is<br>
unclear (. E-cadherin expression is upregulated by TGF-betal.<br>
"Fibronectin" refers to Fibronectin is involved in tissue repair, embryogenesis, blood<br>
clotting, and cell migration/adhesion. It serves as a linker in the ECM (extracellular matrix), and as<br>
dimer found in the plasma (plasma fibronectin). The plasma form is synthesized by hepatocytes,<br>
while the ECM form is made by fibrobasts, chondrocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, as well as<br>
certain epithelial cells. In this context, it interacts with the alpha4beta7 integrin to mediate aspects of<br>
lymphocyte homing or adhesion. The ECM form of fibronectin serves as a general cell adhesion<br>
molecule by anchoring cells to collagen or proteoglycan substrates. Fibronectin also can serve to<br>
organize cellular interaction with the ECM by binding to different components of the extracellular<br>
matrix and to membrane-bound fibronectin receptors on cell surfaces. Finally, fibronectin is<br>
important in cell migration events during embryogenesis.<br>
"Gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders" are a group of chronic disorders that cause<br>
inflammation and/or ulceration in the mucous membrane. These disorders include, for example,<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis and<br>
infectious colitis), mucositis (e.g., oral mucositis, gastrointestinal mucositis, nasal mucositis and<br>
proctitis), necrotizing enterocolitis and esophagitis.<br>
"Inflammatory Bowel Disease" or "IBD" is used interchangeably herein to refer to diseases<br>
of the bowel that cause inflammation and/or ulceration and includes without limitation Crohn's<br>
disease and ulcerative colitis.<br>
"Crohn's diseas e (CD)" or "ulcerative colitis (UC)" are chronic inflammatory bowel<br>
diseases of unknown etiology. Crohn's disease, unlike ulcerative colitis, can affect any part of the<br>
bowel. The most prominent feature Crohn's disease is the granular, reddish-purple edmatous<br>
thickening of the bowel wall. With the development of inflammation, these granulomas often lose<br>
their circumscribed borders and integrate with the surrounding tissue. Diarrhea and obstruction of<br>
the bowel are the predominant clinical features. As with ulcerative colitis, the course of Crohn's<br>
disease may be continuous or relapsing, mild or severe, but unlike ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease<br>
is not curable by resection of the involved segment of bowel. Most patients with Crohn's disease<br>
require surgery at some point, but subsequent relapse is common and continuous medical treatment<br>
is usual.<br>
Crohn's disease may involve any part of the alimentary tract from the mouth to the anus,<br>
although typically it appears in the ileocolic, small-intestinal or colonic-anorectal regions.<br>
Histopathologically, the disease manifests by discontinuous granulomatomas, crypt abscesses,<br>
fissures and aphthous ulcers. The inflammatory infiltrate is mixed, consisting of lymphocytes (both<br>
T and B cells), plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. There is a disproportionate increase in<br>
IgM- and IgG-secreting plasma cells, macrophages and neutrophils.<br>
Anti-inflammatory drugs sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalisylic acid (5-ASA) are useful for<br>
treating mildly active colonic Crohn's disease and is commonly perscribed to maintain remission of<br>
the disease. Metroidazole and ciprofloxacin are similar in efficacy to sulfasalazine and appear to be<br>
particularly useful for treating perianal disease. In more severe cases, corticosteroids are effective in<br>
treating active exacerbations and can even maintain remission. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine<br>
have also shown success in patients who require chronic administration of cortico steroids. It is also<br>
possible that these drugs may play a role in the long-term prophylaxis. Unfortunately, there can be a<br>
very long delay (up to six months) before onset of action in some patients.<br>
Antidiarrheal drugs can also provide symptomatic relief in some patients. Nutritional<br>
therapy or elemental diet can improve the nutritional status of patients and induce symtomatic<br>
improvement of acute disease, but it does not induce sustained clinical remissions. Antibiotics are<br>
used in treating secondary small bowel bacterial overgrowth and in treatment of pyogenb<br>
complications.<br>
"Ulcerative colitis (UC)" afflicts the large intestine. The course of the disease may be<br>
continuous or relapsing, mild or severe. The earliest lesion is an inflammatory infiltration with<br>
abscess formation at the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Coalescence of these distended and<br>
ruptured crypts tends to separate the overlying mucosa from its blood supply, leading to ulceration.<br>
Symptoms of the disease include cramping, lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and frequent,<br>
loose discharges consisting mainly of blood, pus and mucus with scanty fecal particles. A total<br>
colectomy may be required for acute, severe or chronic, unremitting ulcerative colitis.<br>
The clinical features of UC are highly variable, and the onset may be insidious or abrupt,<br>
and may include diarrhea, tenesmus and relapsing rectal bleeding. With fulminant involvement of<br>
the entire colon, toxic megacolon, a life-threatening emergency, may occur. Extraintestinal<br>
manifestations include arthritis, pyoderma gangrenoum, uveitis, and erythema nodosum.<br>
Treatment for UC includes sulfasalazine and related salicylate-containing drugs for mild<br>
cases and corticosteroid drugs in severe cases. Topical adminstration of either salicylates or<br>
corticosteroids is sometimes effective, particularly when the disease is limited to the distal bowel,<br>
and is associated with decreased side effects compared with systemic use. Supportive measures<br>
such as administration of iron and antidiarrheal agents are sometimes indicated. Azathioprine, 6-<br>
mercaptopurine and methotrexate are sometimes also prescribed for use in refractory corticosteroiddependent<br>
cases.<br>
A "modification" of an amino acid residue/position, as used herein, refers to a change of a<br>
primary amino acid sequence as compared to a starting amino acid sequence, wherein the change<br>
results from a sequence alteration involving said amino acid residue/positions. For example, typical<br>
modifications include substitution of the residue (or at said position) with another amino acid (e.g., a<br>
conservative or non-conservative substitution), insertion of one or more (generally fewer than 5 or<br>
3) amino acids adjacent to said residue/position, and deletion of said residue/position. An "amino<br>
acid substitution," or variation thereof, refers to the replacement of an existing amino acid residue in<br>
a predetermined (starting) amino acid sequence with a different amino acid residue. Generally and<br>
preferably, the modification results in alteration in at least one physicobiochemical activity of the<br>
variant polypeptide compared to a polypeptide comprising the starting (or "wild type") amino acid<br>
sequence. For example, in the case of an antibody, a physicobiochemical activity that is altered can<br>
be binding affinity, binding capability and/or binding effect upon a target molecule.<br>
The term "amino acid" within the scope of the present invention is used in its broadest sense<br>
and is meant to include the naturally occurring L a-amino acids or residues. The commonly used<br>
one- and three-letter abbreviations for naturally occurring amino acids are used herein (Lehninger,<br>
A.L., Biochemistry, 2d ed., pp. 71-92, (Worth Publishers, New York, New York, 1975). The term<br>
includes D-amino acids as well as chemically modified amino acids such as amino acid analogs,<br>
naturally occurring amino acids that are not usually incorporated into proteins such as norleucine,<br>
and chemically synthesized compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of an<br>
amino acid. For example, analogs or mimetics of phenylalanine or proline, which allow the same<br>
conformational restriction of the peptide compounds as natural Phe or Pro are included within the<br>
definition of amino acid. Such analogs and mimetics are referred to herein as "functional<br>
equivalents" of an amino acid. Other examples of amino acids are listed by Roberts and Vellaccio,<br>
The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Gross and Meiehofer, Eds., Vol. 5, p. 341 (Academic<br>
Press, Inc., New York, New York, 1983), which is incorporated herein by reference. Where a single<br>
letter is used to designate one of the naturally occurring amino acid, the designations are as<br>
commonly found in the relevant literature (see, for example, Alberts, B. et al. Molecular Biology of<br>
the Cell, 3rd ed., Garland Publishing, Inc. 1994, page 57).<br>
An "isolated" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered<br>
from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment<br>
are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may<br>
include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as<br>
determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree<br>
sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a<br>
spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing<br>
conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody<br>
in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment<br>
will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one<br>
purification step.<br>
The term "variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat" or "amino acid position<br>
numbering as in Kabat", and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain<br>
33<br>
variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al.,<br>
Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes<br>
of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actuallinear amino acid<br>
sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion<br>
into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include<br>
a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted<br>
residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82.<br>
The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of<br>
homology of the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered sequence.<br>
The phrase "substantially similar," or "substantially the same", as used herein, denotes a<br>
sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated with an<br>
antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody) such that<br>
one of skill hi the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no<br>
biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured<br>
by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is preferably less than<br>
about 50%, preferably less than about 40%, preferably less than about 30%, preferably less than<br>
about 20%, preferably less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator<br>
antibody.<br>
"Binding affinity" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent<br>
interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner<br>
(e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity" refers to intrinsic<br>
binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody<br>
and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the<br>
dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art,<br>
including those described herein. Low -affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to<br>
dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain<br>
bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of<br>
which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are<br>
described in the following.<br>
In one embodiment, the "Kd" or "Kd value" according to this invention is measured by a<br>
radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest<br>
and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs<br>
for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (^^l)-la\xi[ed antigen in the<br>
presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab<br>
antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) J. MolBiol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the<br>
assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody<br>
(Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v)<br>
bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23°C). In a<br>
non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [^ij-antigen are mixed with serial<br>
dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in<br>
Presta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight;<br>
however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium<br>
is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room<br>
temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the phte washed eight times with<br>
0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20;<br>
Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten<br>
minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are<br>
chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd<br>
value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore^^-2000 or a<br>
BIAcoreTM-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with immobilized antigen CMS chips at<br>
~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CMS, BIAcore Inc.)<br>
are activated with A^-ethyl-TV'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and./Vhydroxysuccinimide<br>
(NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with lOmM<br>
sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5ug/ml (~0.2uM) before injection at a flow rate of Sul/minute to<br>
achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled proteh. Following the injection of<br>
antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, twofold<br>
serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST)<br>
at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately 25ul/min. Association rates (k^,) and dissociation rates<br>
(koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation<br>
Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The<br>
equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio l^ff/k^ See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al.,<br>
(1999) J. MolBiol 293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 106 M'1 S'1 by the surface plasmon<br>
resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching<br>
technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295<br>
nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25°C of a 20nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in<br>
PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer,<br>
such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco<br>
spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette.<br>
An "on-rate" or "rate of association" or "association rate" or "k^ according to this<br>
invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described<br>
above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with<br>
immobilized antigen CMS chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran<br>
biosensor chips (CMS, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with yV-ethyk/V'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<br>
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and A'-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's<br>
instructions. Antigen is diluted with lOmM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5ug/ml (~0.2uM) before<br>
injection at a flow rate of 5ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled<br>
protein. Following the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. For kinetics<br>
measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05%<br>
Tween 20 (PBST) at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately 25ul/min. Association rates (kon) and<br>
dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore<br>
Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation<br>
sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k0ff/k0n See,<br>
e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol 5/0/293:865-881. However, if the on-rate exceeds 106 M'1 S'1<br>
by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a<br>
fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission<br>
intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 run band-pass) at 25°C of a 20nM antiantigen<br>
antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen<br>
as measured in a a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments)<br>
or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. The<br>
"Kd" or "Kd value" according to this invention is in one embodiment measured by a radiolabeled<br>
antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and antigen molecule as<br>
described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by<br>
equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (125J). labeled antigen in the presence of a<br>
titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated<br>
plate (Chen, et al., (1999) J. MolBiol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter<br>
plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in<br>
50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin<br>
in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23°C). In a non-adsorbant plate<br>
(Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [125i].antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of<br>
interest (consistent with assessement of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997)<br>
Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the<br>
incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached.<br>
Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature for<br>

surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc.,<br>
Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with immobilized antigen CMS chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly,<br>
carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CMS, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyW- (3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and jV-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)<br>
according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with lOmM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into<br>
5ug/ml (~0.2uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response<br>
units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to<br>
block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to<br>
500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately<br>
25ul/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (kgff) are calculated using a simple one-toone<br>
Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the<br>
association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as<br>
the ratio koff/W See&gt; e-§-&gt; chen&gt; Y-&gt; et al-&gt; (1999)J- M&gt;/5/0/293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds<br>
10^ M~l S~l by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by<br>
using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence<br>
emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25 °C of a 20nM<br>

Association rates (k^) and dissociation rates (kof$ are calculated using a simple one-to-one<br>

preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or<br>

The phrase "substantially reduced," or "substantially different", as used herein, denotes a<br>
sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with an<br>
antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody) such that<br>
one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical<br>
significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd<br>
values, KAMA response). The differenc e between said two values is preferably greater than about<br>
10%, preferably greater than about 20%, preferably greater than about 30%, preferably greater than<br>
about 40%, preferably greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the<br>
reference/comparator antibody.<br>
"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to a peptide or polypeptide<br>
sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are<br>
identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide a polypeptide sequence, after aligning<br>
the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence<br>
identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity.<br>
Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in<br>
various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer<br>
software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in<br>
the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms<br>
needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For<br>
purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence<br>
comparison computer program ALIGN-2, wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN-2<br>
program is provided in Table A below. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was<br>
authored by Genentech, Inc. and the source code shown in Table A below has been filed with user<br>
documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under<br>
U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through<br>
Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California or may be compiled from the source code provided<br>
in Figure 8 below. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system,<br>
preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2<br>
program and do not vary.<br>
In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the %<br>
amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino<br>
acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or<br>
comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence<br>
B) is calculated as follows:<br>
100 times the fraction X/Y<br>
where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence<br>
alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total<br>
number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid<br>
sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity<br>
of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.<br>
Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein<br>
are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer<br>
The term "vector," as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of<br>
transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a "plasmid",<br>
which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be<br>
ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein<br>
additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of<br>
autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a<br>
bacterial origin of replication and epBomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal<br>
mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host<br>
cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable<br>
of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred<br>
to herein as "recombinant expression vectors" (or simply, "recombinant vectors"). In general,<br>
expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. hi<br>
the present specification, "plasmid" and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the<br>
most commonly used form of vector.<br>
"Polynucleotide," or "nucleic acid," as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of<br>
nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides,<br>
ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be<br>
incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase, or by a synthetic reaction. A<br>
polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and thenanalogs.<br>
If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after<br>
assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide<br>
components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis, such as by conjugation with<br>
a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, "caps", substitution of one or more of the<br>
naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example,<br>
those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphorates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates,<br>
carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.),<br>
those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies,<br>
signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those<br>
containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing<br>
alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as<br>
unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in<br>
the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphorate groups, phosphate groups, protected by<br>
standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or<br>
may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be phosphorylated<br>
or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other<br>
hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain<br>
analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for<br>
example, 2'-0-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, .alpha.-<br>
anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose<br>
sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One<br>
or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative<br>
linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by<br>
P(O)S("thioate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"), "(0)NR.sub.2 ("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO orCH.sub.2<br>
("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is independently H or sibstituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20<br>
C.) optionally containing an ether (-O-) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl.<br>
Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all<br>
polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.<br>
"Oligonucleotide," as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single stranded, generally<br>
synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length.<br>
The terms "oligonucleotide" and "polynucleotide" are not mutually exclusive. The description above for<br>
polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.<br>
The terms "antibody" and "immunoglobulin" are used interchangeably in the broadest sense<br>
and include monoclonal antibodies (for example, full length or intact monoclonal antibodies),<br>
polyclonal antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so<br>
long as they exhibit the desired biological activity) and may also include certain antibody fragments<br>
(as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be human, humanized and/or affinity<br>
matured.<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion<br>
preferably retains at least one, preferably most or all, of the functions normally associated with that<br>
portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an<br>
antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another<br>
embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least<br>
one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact<br>
antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement<br>
binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half<br>
life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may<br>
comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to<br>
the fragment.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a<br>
population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the<br>
population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in<br>
minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigen.<br>
Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different<br>
antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed<br>
against a single determinant on the antigen.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies in which a<br>
portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences<br>
in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or<br>
subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding<br>
sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or<br>
subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological<br>
activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855<br>
(1984)).<br>
"Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that<br>
contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized<br>
antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable<br>
region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species<br>
(donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity,<br>
66<br>
affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human<br>
immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized<br>
antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor<br>
antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the<br>
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable<br>
domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a nonhuman<br>
immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin<br>
sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further<br>
details, see Jones et al, Atowre321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al, Nature332:323-329 (1988);<br>
and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992). See also the following review articles and<br>

Biotech. 5:428433 (1994).<br>
An "antigen" is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The<br>
target antigen may be polypeptide, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, lipid, hapten or other naturally<br>
occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably, the target antigen is a polypeptide. An "acceptor<br>
human framework" for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a<br>
VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework, or from a human<br>
consensus framework. An acceptor human framework "derived from" a human immunoglobulin<br>
framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or<br>
may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are<br>
present, preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less, or 3 or less, pre-existing amino acid<br>
changes are present. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those<br>
changes are only at three, two or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid<br>
residues at those positions may be 71 A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor<br>
human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence<br>
or human consensus framework sequence.<br>
A "human consensus framework" is a framework which represents the most commonly<br>
occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework<br>
sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a<br>
subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in<br>
Kabat et al. In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In<br>
one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.<br>
67<br>
A "VL subgroup I consensus framework" comprises the consensus sequence obtained from<br>
the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al. In one embodiment, the<br>
VL subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each<br>
of the following sequences:<br>

A "VH subgroup III consensus framework" comprises the consensus sequence obtained<br>
from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al. In one embodiment,<br>
the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of<br>
each of the following sequences: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (SEQ ID NO:38)-H1-<br>
WVRQAPGKGLEWV (SEQ ID NO:39)-H2-RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA<br>
(SEQ ID NO:40)-H3-WGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:41).<br>
An "unmodified human framework" is a human framework which has the same amino acid<br>
sequence as the acceptor human framework, e.g. lacking human to non-human amino acid<br>
substitution(s) in the acceptor human framework.<br>
An "altered hypervariable region" for the purposes herein is a hypervariabb region<br>
comprising one or more (e.g. one to about 16) amino acid substitution(s) therein.<br>
An "un-modified hypervariable region" for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region<br>
having the same amino acid sequence as a non-human antibody from which it was derived, i.e. one<br>
which lacks one or more amino acid substitutions therein.<br>
The term "hypervariable region", "HVR", or "HV", when used herein refers to the regions<br>
of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structural^<br>
defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in the VH (HI, H2,<br>
H3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and<br>
are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on<br>
sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al, Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.<br>
(1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol.<br>
196:901 -917 (1987)). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat<br>
CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling<br>
software. The "contact" hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex<br>
crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.<br><br>
Hypervariable regions may comprise "extended hypervariable regions" as follows: 24-36 or<br>
24-34 (LI), 46-56 or 49-56 or 50-56 or 52-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (HI), 50-65<br>
or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102 or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are<br>
numbered according to Kabat et al., supra for each of these definitions.<br>
"Framework" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the<br>
hypervariable region residues as herein defined.<br>
A "human antibody" is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to<br>
that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for<br>
making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically<br>
excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.<br>
An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs<br>
thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a<br>
parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies<br>
will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies<br>
are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992)<br>
describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or<br>
framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813 (1994);<br>
Schierefa/. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton etal. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004(1995); Jackson et<br>
al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).<br>
A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist" antibody is one which inhibits or reduces<br>
biological activity of the antigen it bind. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies<br>
substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.<br>
An "agonist antibody", as used herein, is an antibody which mimics at least one of the<br>
functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.<br>

As used herein, "treatment" refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural<br>
course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during<br>
the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or<br>
recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological<br>
consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression,<br>
amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some<br>
embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder.<br>
An "effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time<br>
necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.<br>
A "therapeutically effective amount" of a substance/molecule of the invention, agonist or<br>
antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual,<br>
and the ability of the substance/molecule, agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the<br>
individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the<br>
substance/molecule, agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A<br>
"prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time<br>
necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily, since a prophylactic<br>
dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will<br>
be less than the therapeutically effective amount.<br>
The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the<br>
function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive<br>
isotopes (e.g., At211,1131,1125, Y90, Re186, Re188, Sm153, Bi212, P32 and radioactive isotopes of Lu),<br>

Also included in this definition are anti-hormonal agents that act to regulate, reduce, block,<br>
or inhibit the effects of hormones that can promote the growth of cancer, and are often in the form of<br>
systemic, or whole-body treatment. They may be hormones themselves. Examples include antiestrogens<br>
and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including, for example, tamoxifen<br>
(including NOLVADEX® tamoxifen), EVISTA® raloxifene, droloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen,<br>
trioxifene, keoxifene, LY117018, onapristone, and FARESTON® toremifene; anti-progesterones;<br>

A "growth inhibitory agent" when used herein refers to a compound or composition which<br>
inhibits growth of a cell whose growth is dependent upon beta? activation either in vitro or in vivo.<br>
Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of beta7-<br>
dependent cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell<br>
cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce Gl arrest and M-phase<br>
arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and<br>
topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin.<br>
Those agents that arrest Gl also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents<br>
such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-<br>
fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer.<br>
Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., Chapter 1, entitled "Cell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and<br>
antineoplastic drugs" by Murakami et al. (WB Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13. The<br>
taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel<br>
 (TAXOTERE®, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic<br>
analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL®, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the<br>
assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing<br>
depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.<br>
"Doxorubicin" is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is (8Scis)-<br>
10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-lyxo-hexapyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,lltrihydroxy-<br>
8-(hydroxyacetyl) - l-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione.<br>
Compounds useful in combination therapy with an antagonist anti-beta? antibody of the<br>
invention include antibodies (including without limitation other anti-beta7 antagonist antibodies (Fib<br>
21, 22, 27, 30 (Tidswell, M. (1997) supra) or humanized derivatives thereof), anti-alpha4 antibodies<br>
(such as ANTEGEN®), anti-TNF (REMICADE®)) or non-protein compounds including without<br>
limitation 5-ASA compounds ASACOL®, PENTASA™, ROW ASA™, COLAZAL™, and other<br>
compounds such as Purinethol and steroids such as prednisone. In an embodiment, the invention<br>
encompasses a method of treating a patient, such as a human patient, with the antagonist anti-beta7<br>
antibody of the hvention alone or in combination with a second compound that is also useful in<br>
treating inflammation. In one embodiment the second compound is selected from the group<br>
consisting of Fib 21, 22, 27, 30, or humanized derivatives thereof), anti-alpha4 antibodies,<br>
ANTEGEN®, anti-TNF, REMICADE®, 5-ASA compounds, ASACOL®, PENTASA™,<br>
ROWASA™, COLAZAL™, Purinethol, steroids, and prednisone. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, administration of the antagonist anti-beta7 antibody of the invention substantially reduces<br>
the dose of the second compound. In one embodiment, said reduction in the dose of the second<br>
compound is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at<br>
least 90%, at least 95%. In one embodiment of the invention, the combination of the antibody of the<br>
invention and the reduced dose of the second compound relieves symptoms in the patient to<br>
substantially the same degree or better than administration of the second compound alone.<br>
Generating variant antibodies exhibiting reduced or absence of HAMA response<br>
Reduction or elimination of a HAMA (human anti-mouse (also applicable to human anti-rat or<br>
human anti-human) response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents.<br>
See, e.g., Khaxzaeli et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (1988), 80:937; Jaffers et al., Transplantation (1986),<br>
41:572; Shawler et al., J. Immunol. (1985), 135:1530; Sears et al., J. Biol. Response Mod. (1984), 3:138;<br>
Miller et al., Blood (1983), 62:988; Hakimi et al., J. Immunol. (1991), 147:1352; Reichmann et al.,<br>
Nature (1988), 332:323; Junghans et al., Cancer Res. (1990), 50:1495. As described herein, the<br>
invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated.<br>
Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art, some of<br>
which are further described below.<br>
For example, an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting<br>
(parent) sequence for diversification of the framework and/or hypervariable sequence(s). A selected<br>
76<br>
framework sequence to which a starting hypervariable sequence is linked is referred to herein as an<br>
acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from, or derived from, a<br>
human immunoglobulin (the VL and/or VH regions thereof), preferably the acceptor human frameworks<br>
are from, or derived from, a human consensus framework sequence as such frameworks have been<br>
demonstrated to have minimal, or no, immunogenicity in human patients.<br>
Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin, one may optionally select a<br>
human framework sequence that is selected based on its homology to the donor framework sequence<br>
by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection<br>
of human framework sequences, and select the most homologous framework sequence as the<br>
acceptor.<br>
In one embodiment, human consensus frameworks herein are from, or derived from, VH<br>
subgroup III and/or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework sequences.<br>
Thus, the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one, two, three or all of the<br>
following framework sequences:<br>
FR1 comprising EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (SEQ ID NO38),<br>
FR2 comprising WVRQAPGKGLEWV (SEQ ID NO:39),<br>
FR3 comprising FR3 comprises RFTISX1DX2SKNTX3YLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA (SEQ ID<br>
NO:42), wherein XI is A or R, X2 is T or N, and X3 is A, L, or F,<br>
FR4 comprising WGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:41).<br>
Examples of VH consensus frameworks include:<br>
human VH subgroup I consensus framework minus Kabat CDRs (SEQ ID NO: 19);<br>
human VH subgroup I consensus framework minus extended hypervariable regions (SEQ ID<br>
NOs:20-22);<br>
human VH subgroup II consensus framework minus Kabat CDRs (SEQ ID N0i48);<br>
human VH subgroup II consensus framework minus extended hypervariable regions (SEQ ID<br>
N0s:49-51);<br>
human VH subgroup III consensus framework minus Kabat CDRs (SEQ ID NO:52);<br>
human VH subgroup III consensus framework minus extended hypervariable regions (SEQ ID<br>
NO 53-5 5);<br>
human VH acceptor framework minus Kabat CDRs (SEQ ID NO:56);<br>
human VH acceptor framework minus extended hypervariable regions (SEQ ID NOs57-58);<br>
human VH acceptor 2 framework minus Kabat CDRs (SEQ ID NO:59); or<br>
human VH acceptor 2 framework minus extended hypervariable regions (SEQ ID NOs:60-62).<br>
In one embodiment, the VH acceptor human framework comprises one, two, three or all of<br>
the following framework sequences:<br>
FR1 comprising EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (SEQ ID NO:38),<br>
FR2 comprising WVRQAPGKGLEWV (SEQ ID N0:39),<br>
FR3 comprising FR3 comprises RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC A (SEQ ID<br>
NO:43), RFTISRDTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA (SEQ ID NO:44),<br>
RFTISRDTSKNTFYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA (SEQ ID NO:45),<br>
RFTISADTSKNTFYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCA (SEQ ID N0:46),<br>
FR4 comprising WGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:41).<br>
The VL acceptor human framework may comprise one, two, three or all of the following<br>
framework sequences:<br>
FR1 comprising DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (SEQ ID NO:34),<br>
FR2 comprising WYQQKPGKAPKLLI (SEQ ID NO:35),<br>
FR3 comprising GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYC (SEQ ID NO:36),<br>
FR4 comprising FGQGTKVEIKR (SEQ ID NO:37).<br>
Examples of VL consensus frameworks include:<br>
human VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework (SEQ ID NO: 14);<br>
human VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework (extended HVR-L2) (SEQ ID NO: 15);<br>
human VL kappa subgroup II consensus framework (SEQ ID NO: 16);<br>
human VL kappa subgroup III consensus framework (SEQ ID NO: 17); or<br>
human VL kappa subgroup IV consensus framework (SEQ ID NO: 18)<br>
While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected,<br>
whether that is from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework, the present<br>
invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre-existing amino acid<br>
substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework<br>
sequence. These pre-existing substitutions are preferably minimal; usually four, three, two or one<br>
amino acid differences only relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus<br>
framework sequence.<br>
Hypervariable region residues of the non-human antibody are incorporated into the VL<br>
and/or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example, one may incorporate residues corresponding<br>
to the Kabat CDR residues, the Chothia hypervariable loop residues, the Abm residues, and/or<br>
contact residues. Optionally, the extended hypervariable region res idues as follows are<br>
incorporated: 24-34 (LI), 49-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3), 26-35 (HI), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102,<br>
94-102, or 95-102 (H3).<br>
While "incorporation" of hypervariable region residues is discussed herein, it will be appreciated<br>
that this can be achieved in various ways, for example, nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid<br>
sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so<br>
that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues, or by mutating<br>
nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the hypervariable domain residues are<br>
changed to non-human residues, or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence, etc.<br>
In the examples herein, hypervariable region-grafted variants were generated by Kunkel<br>
mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences, using a separate<br>
oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Kunkel et al, Methods Enzymol. 154:367-382 (1987).<br>
Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and/or hypervariable region, using<br>
routine techniques, to correct and re-establish proper hypervariable region-antigen interactions.<br>
Phage(mid) display (also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts) can be used as a<br>
convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a<br>
library generated by sequence randomization. However, other methods for making and screening altered<br>
antibodies are available to the skilled person.<br>
Phage(mid) display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting<br>
novel proteins which bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage(mid)<br>
display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants which can be rapidly sorted for<br>
those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant<br>
polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the<br>
gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic<br>
acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a<br>
portion of the gene III protein have been developed. (Bass, S., Proteins, 8:309 (1990); Lowman and<br>
Wells, Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology, 3:205 (1991)). In a monovalent<br>
phagemid display system, the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins<br>
are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide<br>
libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents (e.g. U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,723,286, U.S. Patent No. 5,432, 018, U.S. Patent No. 5,580,717, U.S. Patent No. 5,427,908 and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,498,530).<br>
Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of<br>
ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family<br>
of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage(mid)<br>
display have been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,750,373, 5,733,743, 5,837,242, 5,969,108,<br>
6,172,197, 5,580,717, and 5,658,727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or<br>
antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.<br>
Methods of substituting an amino acid of choice into a template nucleic acid are well<br>
established in the art, some of which are described herein. For example, hypervariable region<br>
residues can be substituted using the Kunkel method. See, for example, Kunkel etal, Methods<br>
Enzymol. 154:367-382 (1987).<br>
The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the<br>
hypervariable region residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet<br>
sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols<br>
to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below<br>
For example, in the codon set DVK, D can be nucleotides A or G or T; V can be A or G or<br>
C; and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids<br>
Ala, Trp, Tyr, Lys, Thr, Asn, Lys, Ser, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Cys.<br>
Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of<br>
oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, containing sequences<br>
that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will<br>
encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide<br>
"degeneracy" at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain<br>
codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucle ic acid synthesizers (available from, for<br>
example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), or can be obtained commercially (for example,<br>
from Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a<br>
particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences,<br>
the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used<br>
according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic<br>
acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.<br>
In one method, nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by<br>
oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by<br>
Zoller et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 10:6487-6504(1987). Briefly, nucleic acid sequences encoding<br>
80<br>
variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon<br>
sets to a DNA template, where the template is the single-stranded form of the plasmid containing a<br>
variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization, DNA polymerase is used to<br>
synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the<br>
oligonucleotide primer, and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.<br>
Generally, oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal<br>
oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on<br>
either side of the nucleotide(s) coding for the mutation(s). This ensures that the oligonucleotide will<br>
hybridize properly to the single-stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily<br>
synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al., Proc. Nat'l.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 75:5765 (1978).<br>
The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage<br>
M13 vectors (the commercially available M13mpl8 and M13mpl 9 vectors are suitable), or those<br>
vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al., Meth.<br>
Enzymol, 153:3 (1987). Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these<br>
vectors in order to generate single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is<br>
described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook e? a/., above.<br>
To alter the native DNA sequence, the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded<br>
template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme, usually T7 DNA<br>
polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, is then added to synthesize the<br>
complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A<br>
heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of<br>
gene 1, and the other strand (the original template) encodes the native, unaltered sequence of gene 1.<br>
This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell, usually a prokaryote such<br>
as E. coli JM101. After growing the cells, they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the<br>
oligonucleotide primer radiolabelled with a 32-Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that<br>
contain the mutated DNA.<br>
The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex<br>
molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation(s). The modifications<br>
are as follows: The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single-stranded template as<br>
described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyriboadenosine (dATP),<br>
deoxyriboguanosine (dGTP), and deoxyribothymidine (dTT), is combined with a modified<br>
thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP-(aS) (which can be obtained from Amersham). This mixture is<br>
added to the template-oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture,<br>
a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition, this<br>
new strand of DNA will contain dCTP-(aS) instead of dCTP, which serves to protect it from<br>
restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double-stranded heteroduplex is<br>
81<br>
nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme, the template strand can be digested with ExoIII<br>
nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site(s) to be mutagenized.<br>
The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single-stranded. A complete<br>
double-stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four<br>
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, ATP, and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be<br>
transformed into a suitable host cell.<br>
As indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to<br>
hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also, but does not necessarily, contain restriction<br>
sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from<br>
bacteriophage Ml 3 vectors or vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as<br>
described by Viera et al. Meth. Enzymol., 153:3 (1987). Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated must be<br>
inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single-stranded template. Production of the<br>
single-stranded template is described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrooke/a/., supra.<br>
According to another method, a library can be generated by providing upstream and<br>
downstream oligonucleotide sets, each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different<br>
sequences, the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the<br>
oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets, along with a variable domain<br>
template nucleic acid sequence, can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a "library" of<br>
PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as "nucleic acid cassettes", as they can be fused<br>
with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences, for example, viral coat proteins and<br>
dimerization domains, using established molecular biology techniques.<br>
The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent<br>
accessible and highly diverse positions in a hypervariable region. As described above, a codon set is a set<br>
of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.<br>
Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria, as selected through appropriate<br>
screening/selection steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.<br>
Vectors. Host Cells and Recombinant Methods<br>
For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is<br>
isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for<br>
expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional<br>
procedures (eg., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes<br>
encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The choice of<br>
vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally, preferred host cells are of either<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin.<br>
Generating antibodies using prokaryotic host cells:<br>
Vector Construction<br>
Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the<br><br>
invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide<br>
sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells.<br>
Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques.<br>
Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable<br>
of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that<br>
are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of<br>
an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the<br>
vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various<br>
components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide,<br>
or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector<br>
components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker<br>
gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid<br>
insert and a transcription termination sequence.<br>
In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived<br>
from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector<br>
ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing<br>
phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, E. coli is typically transformed using<br>
pBR322, a plasmid derived from an E. coli species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin<br>
(Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed<br>
cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be<br>
modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of<br>
endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies<br>
are described in detail in Carter et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,648,237.<br>
In addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible<br>
with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For<br>
example, bacteriophage such as ^GEMTM. -11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector<br>
which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as£. coli LE392.<br>
The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs,<br>
encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence<br>
located upstream (5') to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall<br>
into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased<br>
levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition,<br>
e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.<br>
A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known.<br>
The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by<br>
removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the<br>
isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and<br>
many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target<br>
genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater<br>
transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide<br>
promoter.<br>
Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the Pgalactamase<br>
and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters<br>
such as the toe or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such<br>
as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have<br>
been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the<br>
target light and heavy chains (Siebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to<br>
supply any required restriction sites.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a<br>
secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across<br>
a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part<br>
of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the<br>
purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal<br>
peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal<br>
sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a<br>
prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline<br>
phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB,<br>
OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of<br>
the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can<br>
occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion<br>
signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are<br>
expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain<br>
host strains (e.g., the E. coli trxB' strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for<br>
disulfide bond formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein<br>
subunits. Proba and Pluckthun Gene, 159:203 (1995).<br>
The present invention provides an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of<br>
expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and<br>
properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by<br>
simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.<br>
One technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,840,523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron. For a<br>
given TIR, a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of<br>
translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the<br>
84<br>
desred expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional<br>
mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence,<br>
although silent changes in the nucleotide sequence are preferred. Alterations in the TIR can include,<br>
for example, alterations in the number or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with<br>
alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the<br>
generation of a "codon bank" at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino<br>
acid sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent). This can be accomplished by<br>
changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as<br>
leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in<br>
making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. (1992)<br>
METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. 4:151-158.<br>
Preferably, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron<br>
therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the<br>
yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can<br>
be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in<br>
Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5, 840,523. Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired<br>
individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.<br>
Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include<br>
Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of<br>
useful bacteria include Escherichia (e.g., E. coli), Bacilli (e.g., B. subtilis), Enterobacteria,<br>
Pseudomonas species (e.g., P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans,<br>
Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla, or Paracoccus. In one embodiment, gramnegative<br>
cells are used. In one embodiment, E. coli cells are used as hosts for the invention.<br>
Examples of E. coli strains include strain W3110 (Bachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol.<br>
2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219; ATCC Deposit<br>
No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 ?fliuA (?tonA)<br>
ptr3 lac Iq lacLS ?ompT?(nmpc-fepE) degP41 karf (U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635). Other strains and<br>
derivatives thereof, such as£. coli 294 (ATCC 31,446), E. coli B,E. coli\ 1776 (ATCC 31,537) and<br>
E. coli RV308 (ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.<br>
Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined<br>
genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., Proteins. 8:309-314<br>
(1990). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration<br>
replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, E. coli, Serratia, or Salmonella<br>
species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325,<br>
pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete<br>
minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be<br>
incorporated in the cell culture.<br>
Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in<br>
conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting<br>
transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.<br>
Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is<br>
replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the<br>
host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The<br>
calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain<br>
substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene<br>
glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.<br>
Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media<br>
known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media<br>
include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also<br>
contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively<br>
permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is<br>
added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.<br>
Any necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may<br>
also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another<br>
supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may<br>
contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine,<br>
cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.<br>
The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For£. coli growth, for<br>
example, the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 °C to about 39 °C, more preferably from<br>
about 25 °C to about 37°C, even more preferably at about 30°C. The pH of the medium may be any<br>
pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. For£. coli, the pH is<br>
preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4, and more preferably about 7.0.<br>
If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression<br>
is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the<br>
invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly,<br>
the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. Preferably,<br>
the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium (see, for example, Simmons et al., J.<br>
Immunol. Methods (2002), 263:133-147). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the<br>
vector construct employed, as is known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into<br>
and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting<br>
the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are<br>
disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins<br>
may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can<br>
be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture<br>
and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins<br>
produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly<br>
known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a<br>
fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for<br>
production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity,<br>
preferably about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to<br>
distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (the preferred carbon/energy source). Small<br>
scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately<br>
100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.<br>
In a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells<br>
have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD550 of about 180-220, at<br>
which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according<br>
to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown<br>
for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although<br>
longer or shorter induction time may be used.<br>
To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various<br>
fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding<br>
of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as<br>
Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,transisomerase<br>
with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The<br>
chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of<br>
heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. (1999) J Bio Chem 274:19601-<br>

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are<br>
proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the<br>
present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in<br>
the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I,<br>
Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some E. coli protease-deficient<br>
strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra, Georgiou et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., MicrobialDrug<br>
Resistance, 2:63-72 (1996).<br>
In one embodiment, E. coli strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with<br>
plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression<br>
system of the invention.<br>
Antibody Purification<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain<br>
preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein<br>
purification methods known hi the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of<br>
suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol<br>
precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as<br>
DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for<br>
example, Sephadex G-75.<br>
hi one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity<br>
purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall<br>
protein from Staphylococcus aureas which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies.<br>
Lindmark et al (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13. The solid phase to which Protein A is<br>
immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface, more preferably a<br>
controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column has been<br>
coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of<br>
contaminants.<br>
As the first step of purification, the preparation derived from the cell culture as described<br>
above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the<br>
antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants nonspecifically<br>
bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid<br>
phase by elution.<br>
Generating antibodies using eukaryotic host cells:<br>
The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the<br>
following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer<br>
element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.<br>
(i) Signal sequence component<br>
A vector for use hi a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other<br>
polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of<br>
interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and<br>
processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression,<br>
mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD<br>
signal, are available.<br>
The DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the<br>
antibody.<br>
(ii) Origin of replication<br>
88<br>
Generally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression<br>
vectors. For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early<br>
promoter.<br>
(Hi) Selection gene component<br>
Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable<br>
marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other<br>
toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic<br>
deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.<br>
One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those<br>
cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug<br>
resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the<br>
drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.<br>
Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable<br>
the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine<br>
kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase,<br>
ornithine decarboxylase, etc.<br>
For example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by<br>
culturing all of the transformants hi a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a<br>
competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).<br>
Alternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR)<br>
transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR<br>
protein, and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (APH) can be<br>
selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an<br>
aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Patent No. 4,965,199.<br>
(iv) Promoter component<br>
Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host<br>
organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are<br>
known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately<br>
25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to<br>
80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may<br>
be any nucleotide. At the 3' end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the<br>
signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3' end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are<br>
suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.<br>
Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for<br>
example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus,<br>
adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a<br>
retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters,<br>
e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such<br>
promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.<br>
The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40<br>
restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early<br>
promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a Hindlll E restriction<br>
fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a<br>
vector is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982) on expression of human pinterferon<br>
cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes<br>
simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the<br>
promoter.<br>
(v) Enhancer element component<br>
Transcription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher<br>
eukaryotes is often increased by Inserting an enhance sequence into the vector. Many enhancer<br>
sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, a-fetoprotein, and<br>
insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples<br>
include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the<br>
cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication<br>
origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982) on enhancing elements<br>
for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5'<br>
or 3' to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5' from the<br>
promoter.<br>
(vi) Transcription termination component<br>
Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences<br>
necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are<br>
commonly available from the 5' and, occasionally 3', untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral<br>
DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated<br>
fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription<br>
termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026<br>
and the expression vector disclosed therein.<br>
(vii) Selection and transformation of host cells<br>
Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher<br>
eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in<br>
culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell<br>
lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human<br>
embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al,<br>
J. Gen Virol 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster<br>
ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli<br>
cells (TM4, Mather,5/o/. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70);<br>
African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells<br>
(HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL<br>
3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB<br>
8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al, Annals<br>
N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).<br>
Host cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for<br>
antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for<br>
inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired<br>
sequences.<br>
(viii) Culturing the host cells<br>
The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of<br>
media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),<br>
Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified<br>
Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the<br>
media described in Ham et al, Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979), Barnes et al. Anal. Biochem .102:255<br>
(1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430;<br>
WO 87/00195; or U.S. Patent Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of<br>
these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as<br>
insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium,<br>
magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and<br>
thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic<br>
compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an<br>
equivalent energy source. Any other necessary suppbments may also be included at appropriate<br>
concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as<br>
temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression,<br>
and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.<br>
(ix) Purification of antibody<br>
When using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or<br>
directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the<br>
paniculate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, are removed, for example, by centrifugation<br>
or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such<br>
expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein<br>
concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease<br>
inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and<br>
antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.<br>
The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example,<br>
hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with<br>
affinity chromatograp hy being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as<br>
an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is<br>
present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human jl, y2,<br>
or y4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al, J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended<br>
for all mouse isotypes and for human y3 (Guss etal, EMBOJ. 5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to<br>
which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available.<br>
Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for<br>
faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the<br>
antibody comprises a Qj3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) is<br>
useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ionexchange<br>
column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica,<br>
chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin<br>
(such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.<br>
Following any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of<br>
interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography<br>
using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt<br>
concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).<br>
Activity Assays<br>
The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical/chemical<br>
properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.<br>
The purified immunoglobulins can be further characterized by a series of assays including,<br>
but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, non-denaturing size exclusion high<br>
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography and<br>
papain digestion.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the immunoglobulins produced herein are analyzed<br>
for their biological activity. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulins of the present invention<br>
are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and<br>
can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using<br>
techniques such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immnosorbent assay),<br>
"sandwich" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A<br>
immunoassays. An illustrative antigen binding assay is provided below in the Examples section.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses<br>
some but not all effector functions, which make it a desired candidate for many applications in<br>
which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as<br>
complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities<br>
of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are<br>
maintained. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the<br>
reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding<br>
assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc^R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC<br>
activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells,<br>
express Fc (RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc(RI, Fc(RH and Fc (RIII. FcR expression on<br>
hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev.<br>
Immunol 9:457-92 (1991). An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule<br>
of interest is described in US Patent No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such<br>
assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo,<br>
e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS(USA) 95:652-656 (1998). Clq<br>
binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence<br>
lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, for example as described Gazzano-Santoro etal., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996), may be performed. FcRn binding and<br>
in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art, for<br>
example those desribed in the Examples section.<br>
Humanized Antibodies<br>
The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for<br>
humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can<br>
have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These<br>
non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken<br>
from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the<br>
method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988)<br>
Nature332:323-327'; Verhoeyen etal. (1988) Sc/ence 239:1534-1536), by substituting hypervariable<br>
region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such<br>
"humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially<br>
less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from<br>
anon-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which<br>
some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from<br>
analogous sites in rodent antibodies.<br>
The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the<br>
humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit"<br>
method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire<br>
library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that<br>
of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (Sims et al.<br>
(1993) J. Immunol. 151:2296; Chothia et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol 196:901. Another method uses a<br>
particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular<br>
subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different<br>
humanized antibodies (Carter et al (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285; Presta et al. (1993)<br>
J. Immunol, 151:2623.<br>
It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the<br>
antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method,<br>
humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various<br>
conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized<br>
sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to<br>
those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable<br>
three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences.<br>
Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of<br>
the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the<br>
candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and<br>
combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such<br>
as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region<br>
residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.<br>
Antibody Variants<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides antibody fragment comprising modifications in the<br>
interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region, wherein the modifications facilitate and/or<br>
promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a<br>
first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the protuberance is<br>
positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides.<br>
Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art, for example, as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168.<br>
In some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described<br>
herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or<br>
other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are<br>
prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid, or by peptide<br>
synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or<br>
substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of<br>
deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final<br>
construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the<br>
94<br>
subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.<br>
A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are<br>
preferred locations for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning mutagenesis" as described by<br>
Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. Here, a residue or group of target residues<br>
are identified (eg., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or<br>
negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of<br>
the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the<br>
substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of<br>
substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amho acid sequence variation is predetermined,<br>
the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the<br>
performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the<br>
target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.<br>
Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxykerminal fusions ranging in<br>
length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as<br>
intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions<br>
include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic<br>
polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecufe include the fusion to the N- or Cterminus<br>
of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum<br>
half-life of the antibody.<br>
Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least<br>
one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest<br>
interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also<br>
contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 2 under the heading of "preferred<br>
substitutions". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial<br>
changes, denominated "exemplary substitutions" in Table 2, or as further described below in<br>
reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.<br>
Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by<br>
selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the<br>
polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation,<br>
(b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.<br>
Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L.<br>
Lehninger, hi Biochemistry, second ed, pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):<br>
(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), lie (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)<br>
(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gin (Q)<br>
(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E)<br>
(4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His(H)<br>
Alternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common<br>
side-chain properties:<br>
(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, He;<br>
(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin;<br>
(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;<br>
(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;<br>
(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;<br>
(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.<br>
Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for<br>
another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution<br>
sites or, more preferably, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.<br>
One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region<br>
residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting<br>
variants) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the<br>
parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional<br>
variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites<br>
(e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The<br>
antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III<br>
product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for<br>
their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate<br>
hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to<br>
identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively,<br>
or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the aitigen-antibody complex to<br>
identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring<br>
residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such<br>
variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and<br>
antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further<br>
development.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prep ared<br>
by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation<br>
from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or<br>
preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCRmutagenesis, and<br>
cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.<br>
It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the<br>
immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention, thereby generating a Fc region variant. The Fc<br>
region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4<br>
Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid<br>
positions including that of a hinge cysteine.<br>
In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in<br>
some embodiments, an antibody used in methods of the invention may comprise one or more<br>
alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, for example in the Fc region. These<br>
antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic<br>
utility as compared to ther wild type counterpart. For example, it is thought that certain alterations<br>
can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) Clq<br>
binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), for example, as described in<br>
97<br>
WO99/51642. See also Duncan &amp; Winter Nature 322:738-40 (1988); US Patent No. 5,648,260; US<br>
Patent No. 5,624,821; and WO94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.<br>
Immunoconjusates<br>
The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates, or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), comprising<br>
an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth<br>
inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal<br>
origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).<br>
The use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents,<br>
i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos (1999)<br>
Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26:151-<br>
172; U.S. patent 4,975,278) theoretically allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and<br>
intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents<br>
may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be<br>
eliminated (Baldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15,1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) "Antibody<br>
Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents hi Cancer Therapy: A Review," in Monoclonal Antibodies '84:<br>
Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy with<br>
minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have<br>
been reported as useful in thes e strategies (Rowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Irnmunother.,<br>
21:183-87). Drags used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and<br>
vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include<br>
bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as<br>
geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) Jour, of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19): 1573-1581; Mandler et al<br>
(2000) Bioorganic &amp; Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem.<br>
13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-<br>
8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res.<br>
53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms<br>
including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to<br>
be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands,<br>
ZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate<br>
composed of a murine IgGl kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found<br>
on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and '"in or ^Y radioisotope bound by a<br>
thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al<br>
(2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al<br>
(2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-<br>
Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most<br>
patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drag<br>
conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the<br>
98<br>
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; US Patent<br>
Nos. 4970198; 5079233; 5585089; 5606040; 5693762; 5739116; 5767285; 5773001). Cantuzumab<br>
mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody<br>
linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is advancing into Phase<br>
II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and<br>
others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologies, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug<br>
conjugate composed of an anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody<br>
linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the protential treatment of<br>
prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE), monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), and<br>
synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific<br>
to Lewis Y on carcinomas) andcACIO (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies)<br>
(Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778- 784; and Francisco, et al. (2003) Blood,<br>
102, 1458-1465) and are under therapeutic development. Other compounds for use as drug<br>
conjugate cytotoxic agents include without limitation auristatin E (AE), MMAF (a variant of<br>
auristatin E (MMAE) with a phenylalanine at the C-terminus of the drug), and AEVB (auristatin E<br>
valeryl benzylhydrazone, an acid labile linker through the C-terminus of AE). Useful conjugate<br>
linkers for attaching a drug to an antibody include without limitation MC (maleimidocaproyl), Val<br>
Cit (valine-citrulline, dipeptide site in protease cleavable linker), Citrulline (2-amino-5-ureido<br>
pentanoic acid), PAB (p-aminobenzylcarbamoyl, a "self immolative" portion of linker), Me (Nmethyl-<br>
valine citrulline where the linker peptide bond has been modified to prevent its cleavage by<br>
cathepsin B), MC(PEG)6-OH (maleimidocaproyl- polyethylene glycol, attached to antibody<br>
cysteines), SPP (N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate), and SMCC (N-Succinimidyl 4-(Nmaleimidomethyl)<br>
cyclohexane-1 carboxylate). These and other useful drug conjugates and their<br>
preparation are disclosed, for example, in Doronina, S.O. et al., Nature Biotechnology 21:778-794<br>
(2003), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Particularly preferred linker molecules<br>
include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) (see, e.g., Carlsson et<br>
al., Biochem. J., 173, 723-737 (1978)), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB) (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) (see, e.g., CAS<br>
Registry number 341498-08-6), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohe- xane-1-<br>
carboxylate (SMCC) (see, e.g., Yoshitake et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 101, 395-399 (1979)), and Nsuccinimidyl<br>
4-methyl-4-[2-(5-nitro-pyridyl)— dithiojpentanoate (SMNP) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,563,304).<br>
Chemotherapeutic agents useful hi the generation of such immunoconjugates have been<br>
described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include<br>
diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites<br>
fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S),<br>
momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin,<br>
restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available<br>
for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include 2UBi, 13II, I3'ln, 90Y, and l86Re.<br>
Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional proteincoupling<br>
agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT),<br>
bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HC1), active esters (such as<br>
disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (pazidobenzoyl)<br>
hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-<br>
ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine<br>
compounds (such as l,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be<br>
prepared as described in Vitetta et al, Science. 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-<br>
isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary<br>
chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See W094/11026.<br>
Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin,<br>
maytansinoids, a trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin<br>
activity, are also contemplated herein.<br>
Maytansine and maytansinoids<br>
In one embodiment, an antibody (full length or fragments) of the invention is conjugated to<br>
one or more maytansinoid molecules.<br>
Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization.<br>
Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata (U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such<br>
as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Patent No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and<br>
derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,137,230;<br>
4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269;<br>
4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866;<br>
4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Maytansinoid-antibody conjugates<br>
In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index, maytansine and maytansinoids have been<br>
conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing<br>
maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,208,020,<br>
5,416,064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 Bl, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly<br>
incorporated by reference. Liu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA93:8618-8623 (1996) described<br>
immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody<br>
C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic<br>
towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay.<br>
Chan et aL, Cancer Research52:127-131 (1992) describe immunoconjugates in which a<br>
maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen<br>
on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA. 1 that binds the<br>
HER-2/new oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.l-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on<br>
the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3 x 10s HER-2 surface antigens per<br>
cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug,<br>
which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody<br>
molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.<br>
Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates (immunoconjugates)<br>
Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a<br>
maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the<br>
antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per<br>
antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively<br>
affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody<br>
would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well<br>
known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources.<br>
Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,208,020 and in the other<br>
patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are<br>
maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the<br>
maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.<br>
There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid<br>
conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,208,020 or EP Patent 0 425<br>
235 Bl, and Chari et al., Cancer Research52:127-131 (1992). The linking groups include disulfide<br>
groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase<br>
labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents, disulfide and thioether groups being<br>
preferred.<br>
Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional<br>
protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP),<br>
succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional<br>
derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HC1), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl<br>
suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl)<br>
hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine),<br>
diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-<br>
difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Particularly preferred coupling agents include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al., Biochem. J. 173:723-737 [1978]) and Nsuccinimidyl-<br>
4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.<br>
The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on<br>
the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group<br>
using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a<br>
hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a<br>
hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.<br>
Calicheamicin<br>
Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more<br>
calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing doublestranded<br>
DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the<br>
calicheamicin family, see U.S. patents 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701,<br>
5,770,710, 5,773,001, 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of<br>
calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, ?/, a2', a3', N-acetyl-?,1, PSAG and<br>
?'i (Hinman et al., Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., Cancer Research 58:2925-<br>
2928 (1998) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug<br>
that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA<br>
have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular<br>
uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic<br>
effects.<br>
Other cytotoxic agents<br>
Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include<br>
BCNU, streptozoicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively LLE33288<br>
complex described in U.S. patents 5,053,394, 5,770,710, as well as esperamicins (U.S.<br>
patent 5,877,296).<br>
Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A<br>
chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, a\pha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins,<br>
dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia<br>
inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin,<br>
phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, WO 93/21232 published October<br>
28, 1993.<br>
The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an<br>
antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a riboruclease or a DNA endonuclease<br>
such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).<br>
For selective destruction of the tumor, the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom.<br>
A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies.<br>
Examples include At211,1131,1125, V0, Re186, Re188, Sm'53, Bi212, P32, Pb212 and radioactive isotopes of<br>
Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic<br>
studies, for example tc99"1 or I123, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging<br>
(also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium -<br>
111, fluorine-19, carbon-13,nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.<br>
The radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For<br>
example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid<br>
synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of<br>
hydrogen. Labels such as tc99™ or I123, .Re186, Re188 and In1" can be attached via a cysteine residue<br>
in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al<br>
(1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57 can be used to incorporate iodine-123.<br>
"Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy" (Chatal,CRC Press 1989) describes other methods<br>
in detail.<br>
Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional<br>
protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP),<br>
succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional<br>
derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HC1), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl<br>
suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl)<br>
hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine),<br>
diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-<br>
difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in<br>
Vitetta et al, Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled l-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-<br>
methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for<br>
conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a "cleavable<br>
linker" facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker,<br>
peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et<br>
al.. Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Patent No. 5,208,020) may be used.<br>
The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC<br>
prepared with cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH,<br>
SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS,<br>
sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyK4-vinylsulfone)benzoate)<br>
which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL., U.S.A).See<br>
pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.<br>
Preparation of antibody drug conjugates<br>
In the antibody drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention, an antibody (Ab) is conjugated to<br>
one or more drug moieties (D), e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, through a linker<br>
(L). The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry<br>
reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a<br>
nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Ab-L, via a covalent bond,<br>
followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety<br>
with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the<br>
nucleophilic group of an antibody.<br>
Ab-(L-D)P I<br>
Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine<br>
groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv)<br>
sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl<br>
groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on<br>
linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters,<br>
haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes,<br>
ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides,<br>
i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by<br>
treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form,<br>
theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into<br>
antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in<br>
conversion of an amine into a thiol.<br>
Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the<br>
antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic subsituents on the<br>
linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate<br>
oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of<br>
linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting inline Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage,<br>
or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment,<br>
reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or<br>
sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can<br>
react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another<br>
embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium<br>
meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan &amp;<br>
Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; US 5362852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a<br>
drug moiety or linker nucleophile.<br>
Likewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol,<br>
hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and<br>
arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker<br>
moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters,<br>
haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes,<br>
ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.<br>
Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made,<br>
e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective<br>
regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a<br>
region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a "receptor" (such<br>
streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is<br>
administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a<br>
clearing agent and then administration of a "ligand" (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic<br>
agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).<br>
Antibody Derivatives<br>
The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional<br>
nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties<br>
suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of<br>
water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of<br>
ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3-dioxolane, poly-l,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer,<br>
polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene<br>
oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyemylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due<br>
to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or<br>
unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one<br>
polymers are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or<br>
type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but<br>
not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the<br>
antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
Therapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage<br>
by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable<br>
carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.<br>
(1980)), in the form of aqueous solutions, lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable<br>
carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations<br>
employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids;<br>
antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as<br>
octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride,<br>
benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl<br>
paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less<br>
than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins;<br>
hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine,<br>
asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates<br>
including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EOT A; sugars such as sucrose,<br>
mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Znprotein<br>
complexes); and/or non- ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG).<br>
The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for<br>
the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not<br>
adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are<br>
effective for the purpose intended.<br>
The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by<br>
coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or<br>
gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug<br>
delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles<br>
and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).<br>
The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily<br>
accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.<br>
Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release<br>
preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the<br>
immunoglobulin of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or<br>
microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example,<br>
poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919),<br>
copolymersofL-glutamicacidand yethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate,<br>
degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable<br>
microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-<br>
(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic<br>
acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter<br>
time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time, they may<br>
denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37°C, resulting in a loss of biological<br>
activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization<br>
depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to<br>
be intermolecular S -S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be<br>
achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture<br>
content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.<br>
Uses<br>
An antibody of the present invention may be used in, for example, in vitro, ex vivo and in<br>
vivo therapeutic methods. Antibodies of the invention can be used as an antagonist to partially or<br>
fully block the specific antigen activity in vitro, ex vivo and/or in vivo. Moreover, at least some of<br>
the antibodies of the invention can neutralize antigen activity from other species. Accordingly, the<br>
antibodies of the invention can be used to inhibit a specific antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture<br>
containing the antigen, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with<br>
which an antibody of the invention cross-reacts (e.g. chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus<br>
and rhesus, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention can be used for<br>
inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is<br>
inhibited. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule.<br>
In one embodiment, an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for inhibiting an<br>
antigen in a subject suffering from a disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental, comprising<br>
administering to the subject an antibody of the invention such that the antigen activity in the subject<br>
is inhibited. Preferably, the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject.<br>
Alternatively, the subject can be a mammal expressing the antigen with which an antibody of the<br>
invention binds. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which the antigen has been<br>
introduced (e.g., by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene). An<br>
antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes.<br>
Moreover, an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing an<br>
antigen with which the immunoglobulin cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig or mouse) for veterinary<br>
purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be<br>
useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages<br>
and time courses of administration). Blocking antibodies of the invention that are therapeutically<br>
useful include, for example but are not limited to, anti-HER2, anti-VEGF, anti-IgE, anti-CD 11, antiinterferon<br>
and anti- tissue factor antibodies. The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat,<br>
inhibit, delay progression of, prevent/delay recurrence of, ameliorate, or prevent diseases, disorders<br>
or conditions associated with abnormal expression and/or activity of one or more antigen molecules,<br>
including but not limited to malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid<br>
malignancies; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial,<br>
stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.<br>
In one aspect, a blocking antibody of the invention is specific to a ligand antigen, and<br>
inhibits the antigen activity by blocking or interfering with the ligand-receptor interaction involving<br>
the ligand antigen, thereby inhibiting the corresponding signal pathway and other molecular or<br>
cellular events. The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies which do not necessarily<br>
prevent ligand binding but interfere with receptor activation, thereby inhibiting any responses that<br>
would normally be initiated by the ligand binding. The invention also encompasses antibodies that<br>
either preferably or exclusively bind to ligand-receptor complexes. An antibody of the invention<br>
can also act as an agonist of a particular antigen receptor, thereby potentiating, enhancing or<br>
activating either all or partial activities of the ligand-mediated receptor activation.<br>
In certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody conjugated with a<br>
cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. In some embodiments, the immunoconjugate and/or<br>
antigen to which it is bound is/are internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy<br>
of the immunoconjugate hi killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment, the<br>
cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. Examples of such cytotoxic<br>
agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein (such as a maytansinoid or a<br>
calicheamicin), a radioactive isotope, or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.<br>
Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other<br>
compositions in a therapy. For instance, an antibody of the mention may be co-administered with<br>
another antibody, chemotherapeutic agent(s) (including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents), other<br>
cytotoxic agent(s), anti-angiogenic agent(s), cytokines, and/or growth inhibitory agent(s). Where an<br>
antibody of the hvention inhibits tumor growth, it may be particularly desirable to combine it with<br>
one or more other therapeutic agent(s) which also inhibits tumor growth. For instance, an antibody<br>
of the invention may be combined with an anti-VEGF antibody (e.g., AVASTTN) and/or anti-ErbB<br>
antibodies (e.g. HERCEPTIN18 anti-HER2 antibody) in a treatment scheme, e.g. in treating any of<br>
the diseases described herein, including colorectal cancer, metastatic breast cancer and kidney<br>
cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the patient may receive combined radiation therapy (e.g.<br>
external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent, such as an antibody). Such<br>
combined therapies noted above include combined administration (where the two or more agents are<br>
included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case,<br>
administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to, and/or following, administration<br>
of the adjunct therapy or therapies.<br>
The antibody of the invention (and adjunct therapeutic agent) is/are administered by any<br>
suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal,<br>
and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In<br>
addition, the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of<br>
the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route, for example by injections, such as intravenous or<br>
subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.<br>
The antibody composition of the invention will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a<br>
fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the<br>
particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the<br>
individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of<br>
administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners.<br>
The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to<br>
prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the<br>
amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment,<br>
and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with<br>
administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed<br>
dosages.<br>
For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the<br>
invention (when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents)<br>
will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the<br>
disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous<br>
therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending<br>
physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of<br>
treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 ug/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g.<br>
O.lmg/kg-lOmg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient,<br>
whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One<br>
typical daily dosage might range from about 1 ug/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the<br>
factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on<br>
the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs.<br>
One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05mg/kg to about<br>
lOmg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg, 4.0mg/kg or lOmg/kg (or any<br>
combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered<br>
intermit tently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about<br>
two to about twenty, e.g. about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed<br>
by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises<br>
administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of<br>
about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of<br>
this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.<br>
Articles of Manufacture<br>
In another aspect of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for<br>
the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided. The article<br>
of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the<br>
container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may<br>
be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition<br>
which is by itself or when combined with another composition effective for treating, preventing<br>
and/or diagnosing the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may<br>
be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection<br>
needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an antibody of the invention. The label or<br>
package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as<br>
cancer. Moreover, the article of manufacture may comprise (a) a first container with a composition<br>
contained therein, wherein the composition comprises an antibody of the invention; and (b) a second<br>
container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises a further<br>
cytotoxic agent. The article of manufacture in this embodiment of the invention may further<br>
comprise a package insert indicating that the first and second antibody compositions can be used to<br>
treat a particular condition, for example cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of<br>
manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceuticallyacceptable<br>
buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline,<br>
Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from<br>
a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.<br>
The following are examples of the methods and compositions of the invention. It is<br>
understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided<br>
above.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The examples herein describe the generation of humanized anti-beta? antibodies from a rat<br>
anti-mouse antibody that binds to the beta? subunit of the alpha4beta? integrin.<br>
Example 1: Humanization of a beta? antagonist antibody<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Residue numbers are according to Kabat (Kabat et al, Sequences of proteins of<br>
immunological interest, 5th Ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD<br>
(1991)). Single letter amino acid abbreviations are used. DNA degeneracies are represented using<br>
the IUB code (N = A/C/G/T, D = A/G/T, V = A/C/G, B= C/G/T, H= A/C/T, K = G/T, M = A/C, R =<br>
A/G, S = G/C, W= A/T, Y = C/T).<br>
Direct hypervariable region grafts onto the acceptor human consensus framework - The<br>
phagemid used for this work, pVO350-2b, was a monovalent Fab-g3 display vector having 2 open<br>
reading frames under control of the phoA promoter, essentially as described in Lee et al, J. Mol.<br>
Biol. (2004), 340(5): 1073-93. The first open reading frame consists of the stll signal sequence fused<br>
to the VL and CHI domains of the acceptor light chain and the second consists of the stll signal<br>
sequence fused to the VH and CHI domains of the acceptor heavy chain followed by a truncated<br>
form of the minor phage coat protein P3 (Lowman, H. et al. (1990) Biochemistry 30:10832).<br>
The VL and VH domains from rat Fib504 (antibody FIB504.64 produced by hybridoma<br>
ATCC HB-293, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108,<br>
USA) were aligned with the human consensus kappa I (huKI) and human subgroup III consensus<br>
VH (huIII) domains. To make the hypervariable region (HVR) grafts, the following frameworks<br>
were used: HuKI was used for the light chain variable domain framework (see FIGS. 1A and 7).<br>
110<br>
For the heavy chain variable domain framework, the acceptor VH framework, a modified human<br>
subgroup III (humlll) consensus VH domain which differs from the humlll sequence at 3 positions:<br>
R71A, N73T, and L78A may be used (see Carter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4285 (1992))<br>
(see Fig. IB). In generation of antibodies of the present invention, the 504K.-RF graft was also<br>
prepared from the modified human subgroupIII consensus VH domain by making the following<br>
amino acid substitutions: A71R and A78F.<br>
Hypervariable regions from rat Fib504 (produced by hybridoma ATCC HB-293) antibody<br>
were engineered into the acceptor human subgroup III consensus VH framework to generate a direct<br>
HVR-graft (Fib504graft) (see Fig. IB). In the VL domain the following regions from rat Fib504<br>
were grafted to the human consensus acceptor, huKI: positions 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97<br>
(L3) (Fig. 1A). In the VH domain, positions 26-35 (HI), 49-65 (H2) and 94-102 (H3) were grafted<br>
(Fig. IB). In addition a second HVR graft, Fib504Kgraft, was constructed that also included within<br>
the HVR, VL position 49, based on an extended definition for L2 (see MacCallume? al. J. Mol.<br>
Biol. 262: 732-745 (1996)). MacCallum et al. have analyzed antibody and antigen complex crystal<br>
structures and found position 49 of the light chain and positions 49 and 94 of the heavy chain are<br>
part of the antigen contact region thus, these positions were included in the definitions of HVR-L2,<br>
HVR-H2 and HVR-H3 for humanized anti-beta7 antibodies disclosed herein.<br>
The direct-graft variants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis (Kunkel et al. (1987) supra)<br>
using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Correct clones were assessed by<br>
DNA sequencing.<br>
Soft randomization of the hypervariable regions: -<br>
The process of "soft randomization" (see US Application Serial No. 60/545,840) refers a<br>
procedure for biased mutagensis of a selected protein sequence, such as a hypervariable region of an<br>
antibody. The method maintains a bias towards the murine, rat, or other starting hypervariable<br>
region sequence, while introducing an approximately 10-50 percent mutation at each selected<br>
position. This technique increases the capacity of the library screening employed and avoids a<br>
change in the antigen epitope recognized by the antibody. According to this soft randomization<br>
technique, sequence diversity is introduced into each hypervariable region using a strategy that<br>
maintains a bias towards the murine hypervariable region sequence. This was accomplished using a<br>
poisoned oligonucleotide synthesis strategy first described by Gallop et al, J. Med, Chem. 37:1233-<br>
1251 (1994). However, other methods for maintaining a bias towards the non-human hypervariable<br>
region residue are available, such as error prone PCR, DNA shuffling, etc.<br>
According to the method used herein, for a given position within a hypervariable region to<br>
be mutated, the codon encoding the wild-type amino acid is poisoned with a mixture (e.g. a 70-10-<br>
10-10 mixture) of nucleotides resulting in an approximately 50 percent mutation rate at each<br>
selected hypervariable region position. To achieve this, the codon encoding the wild-type<br>
hypervariable region amino acid to be mutated is synthesized with a low level of contaminating<br>
mixture of the other three nucleotides, such as a 70-10-10-10 mixture of nucleotides. Thus, by way<br>
of example, for soft randomization of PRO (CCG), the first position synthes ized is a mixture of 70%<br>
C, and 10% each of G, T and A; the second position is a mixture of 70% C, and 10% each of A, G,<br>
andT; and the third position is a mixture of 70% G, and 10% each of A, C and T. It is understood<br>
that the bias can be adjusted up or down depending upon the codon being synthesized at a given<br>
position, the number of codons that code for a particular amino acid, and the degree that<br>
oligonucleotide synthesis is poisoned by the nucleotide composition of the synthesis mixture.<br>
Soft randomized oligonucleotides can be patterned after the murine, rat or other starting<br>
hypervariable region sequences and encompass the same regions defined by the direct hypervariable<br>
region grafts. Optionally, two positions, amino acids at the beginning of H2 andH3 in the VH<br>
domain, may be limited in their diversity: the codon RGC may be used for position 49 encoding A,<br>
G, S or T and at position 94, the codon AKG may be used encoding M or R.<br>
Generation ofphage libraries - Randomized oligonucleotide pools designe d for each<br>
hypervariable region were phoshorylated separately in six 20 ul reactions containing 660 ng of<br>
oligonucleotide, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCfe, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM DTT, and 5 U<br>
polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37°C. The six phosphorylated oligonucbotide pools were then<br>
combined with 20 ng of Kunkel template in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 in a final volume of<br>
500 ul resulting in an oligonucleotide to template ratio of 3. The mixture was annealed at 90 °C for<br>
4 min, 50 °C for 5 min and then cooled on ice. Excess, unannealed oligonucleotide was removed<br>
with a QIAQUICK™ PCR purification kit (Qiagen kit 28106, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using a<br>
modified protocol to prevent excessive denaturation of the annealed DNA. To the 500 ul of<br>
annealed mixture, 150 ul of Qiagen buffer PB was added, and the mixture was split between 2 silica<br>
columns. Following a wash of each column with 750 ul of Qiagen buffer PE and an extra spin to<br>
dry the columns, each column was eluted with 110 ul of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EOT A, pH 8. The<br>
annealed and cleaned-up template (220 ul) was then filled in by adding 1 ul lOOmM ATP, 10 ul<br>
25mM dNTPs (25mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 15 ul lOOmM DTT, 25 ul 10X TM<br>
buffer (0.5 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 M MgCt), 2400 U T4 ligase, and 30 U T7 po lymerase for 3 h at<br>
room temperature.<br>
The filled-in product was analyzed on Tris-Acetate-EDTA/agarose gels (Sidhu et al, Methods<br>
in £nzymo/ogx328:333-363 (2000)). Three bands are usually visible: the bottom band is correctly<br>
filled and ligated product, the middle band is filled but unligated and the top band is strand<br>
displaced. The top band is produced by an intrinsic side activity of T7 polymerase and is difficult to<br>
avoid (Lechner et al, J. Biol. Chem. 258:11174-11184 (1983)); however, this band transforms 30-<br>
fold less efficiently than the bottom band and usually contributes little to the library. The middle<br>
band is due to the absence of a 5' phosphate for the final ligation reaction; this band transforms<br>
efficiently and gives mainly wild type sequence.<br>
The filled in product was then cleaned-up and electroporated into SS320 cells and propagated<br>
in the presence of M13/KO7 helper phage as described by Sidhu et al, Methods in Enzymology<br>
328:333-363 (2000). Library sizes ranged from 1-2x10? independent clones. Random clones<br>
from the initial libraries were sequenced to assess library quality.<br>
Phage Selection - Full length human integrin alpha4beta7 was expressed in 293 cells (Graham<br>
et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)), purified by Fib504 affinity chromatography and used as the<br>
target for phage selection. For immobilization on MaxiSorp™ microtiter plates (Nalge Nunc,<br>
Rochester, NY), 100 ul of human integrin alpha4beta7 was coated at 5 ng/ml in 150 mM NaCl, 50<br>
mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCt, 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM MnCl2 (TBSM), overnight at 4 degrees C.<br>
Wells were blocked for 1 h using TBSM containing 1 % BSA. For the first round of selection, 8<br>
wells coated with target were used; a single target coated well was used for successive rounds of<br>
selection. Phage were harvested from the culture supernatant and suspended in TBSM containing 1<br>
% BSA and 0.05 % TWEEN™ 20 (TBSMBT). After binding to the wells for 2 h, unbound phage<br>
were removed by extensive washing with TBS containing 0.05 % TWEEN 20 (TEST). Bound<br>
phage were eluted by incubating the wells with 100 mM HC1 for 30 min. Phage were amplified<br>
using Top 10 cells and M13/K07 helper phage and grown overnight at 37 °C in 2YT, 50 ug/ml<br>
carbanacillin. The liters of phage eluted from a target coated well were compared to liters of phage<br>
recovered from a non-target coated well to assess enrichment. After four rounds of selection were<br>
performed, random clones were selected for sequence analysis.<br>
Fab Production and Affinity Determination - To express Fab protein for affinity<br>
measurements, a stop codon was introduced between the heavy chain and g3 in the phage display<br>
vector. Clones were transformed into E. coli 34B8 cells and grown in AP5 media at 30 C (Presta, L.<br>
et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10<br>
mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA pH 8 and broken open using a microfluidizer. Fab was purified with Protein<br>
G affinity hromatography.<br>
Affinity determinations were performed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore™-<br>
3000 (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ). Humanized Fib504 Fab variants were immobilized in lOmM<br>
acetate pH 4.5 (ranging from 250 to 1500 response units (RU)) on a CMS sensor chip and 2-fold<br>
dilutions of human integrin alpha4beta7 (1.5 to 770 nM) in TBSM containing 2 % n-octylglucoside<br>
were injected. Each sample was analyzed with 5-minute association and 5 to 60-minute dissociation<br>
times. After each injection, the chip was regenerated using three 1-minute injections of 8 M urea.<br>
Binding response was corrected by subtracting the RU from a blank flow cell. A 1:1 Languir model<br>
of simultaneous fitting of kon and kofrwas used for kinetics analysis.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Humanization of rat Fib504 - The human acceptor framework used for humanization is based<br>
on the framework used for HERCEPTIN® and consists of the consensus human kappa I (huKI) VL<br>
domain and a variant of the human subgroup III (humlll) consensus VH domain. This variant VH<br>
domain has 3 changes from the human consensus: R71A, N73T and L78A. The VL and VH<br>
domains of rat Fib504 were each aligned with the human kappa I and subgroup III domains; each<br>
hypervariable region (HVR) was identified and grafted into the human acceptor framework to<br>
generate a HVR graft (504 graft) that could be displayed as an Fab on phage (Figs. 1A and IB).<br>
Based on the analysis of available antibody and antigen complex crystal structures<br>
MacCallum et al. (MacCallume? al. J. Mol. Biol. 262: 732-745 (1996)) proposed HVR definitions<br>
based on variable domain residues that frequently contact antigens. Thus positions 49G and 94M of<br>
the heavy chain were included in the HVR graft of Fib504 (Fig. IB). In addition, a second HVR<br>
graft, Fib504Kgraft, was also generated which included position 49K of the light chain, because this<br>
position is also within the contact definition of HVR-L2 and can serve as an antigen contact (Fig.<br>
1A). When either the Fib504 or Fib504K grafts were displayed on phage and tested for binding to<br>
immobilized alpha4beta7, no binding was observed.<br>
Libraries were generated using both the Fib504 and Fib504-K HVR grafts in which each of<br>
the HVR regions were soft randomized simultaneously. Each HVR graft library was panned against<br>
immobilized alpha4beta7 for 4 rounds of selection. No enrichment was observed and clones picked<br>
for DNA sequence analysis displayed only random sequence changes targeted to the 6 HVR regions.<br>
Two additional VH framework sequences, "RL" and "RF" were investigated as acceptor<br>
frameworks and contained changes at positions 71 and 78. Position 71 was changed to an Arginine<br>
as in the human subgroup III consensus, and position 78 was changed to a Leucine as in the human<br>
subgroup III consensus (acceptor framework "RL") or a Phenylalanine as in the human subgroup II<br>
consensus and the rat Fib504 VH framework (acceptor framework "RF") (Fig. 10A). When either<br>
the Fib504 or Fib504K graft in the "RL" (Fib504-RL and Fib504K-RL) or "RF" (Fib504-RF and<br>
Fib504K-RF) acceptor framework was displayed on phage and tested for binding to immobilized<br>
alpha4beta7. Specific phage binding was only observed for the Fib504K graft using the "RF"<br>
framework (Fig. 10B). The modest binding of phage displaying the Fib504-RF graft relative to the<br>
other grafts lacking Y49K (light chain) and L78F (heavy chain) indicates the importance of these<br>
positions in selecting a useful acceptor framework.<br>
Libraries were generated as before using a soft randomization strategy simultaneously at each<br>
of the 6 HVRs for the Fib504K-RL and Fib504K-RF grafts and sorted on immobilized alpha4beta7<br>
for 4 rounds of selection as described above. Enrichment was only observed for the library based on<br>
the Fib504K-RF graft. Clones from round 4 of the Fib504K-RF library were selected for sequence<br>
analysis and revealed ammo acid changes targeted to HVR-L1. Most clones contained the change<br>
Y32L; in addition position 31 was frequently changed to D, S, P or N (Fig. 1C). In addition to the<br>
starting graft, Fib504K-RF, 3 clones were expressed and purified as Fab protein and further<br>
analyzed by Biacore as described above. Clones hu504-5, hu504-16 and hu504-32 (variants of SEQ<br>
ID NO:1 containing substituions T31S plus Y32L (variant hu504.5), Y32L (variant hu504.16), or<br>
T31D plus Y32L (variant hu504.32); see Figure 1C), showed excellent binding to alpha4beta7<br>
relative to the Fib504K-RF graft and met or exceeded the affinity of the chimeric Fib504 Fab for<br>
binding to alpha4beta7. The results of the Biacore analysis are shown in Table 3, below, and<br>
indicate that selected variation in the HVRs and/or framework regions, disclosed herein, generated<br>
antagonist antibodies to alpha4beta7 having improved affinity relative to the starting antibody. The<br>
results in Table 3 indicate that humanized variant 504.32 showed the greatest increase in affinity<br>
relative to the starting rat antibody by binding 3-fold more tightly to alpha4beta7.<br>
The results in Table 3 also indicate that the redesign of HVR-L1 was important to the<br>
restoration of high affinity antigen binding. In particular, the mutation Y32L was most frequent<br>
among the various clones. Other changes at position 31 and numerous other substitutions<br>
throughout HVR-H1 appear to be well tolerated and may provide additional improvement. From<br>
these results it is clear that there are multiple sequence changes that can improve the affinity of<br>
Fib504 grafted onto a human framework to generate affinities that meet or exceed that of the initial<br>
rat antibody.<br>
Thus, starting from the graft of the 6 rat Fib504 HVRs into the human acceptor scaffold, the<br>
expansion of HVR-L2 to include position 49 (Lysine), expansion of HVR-H2 to include position 49<br>
(Glycine), and the expansion of HVR-94 to include position 94 (Methionine) as well as amino acid<br>
changes at position 32 of VHR-L1 (where L or I replace Y) and, optionally, at position 31 of the<br>
VHR-L1 (where T is replaced by D or S, for example). Useful framework amino acid changes were<br>
made at positions 71 (A71R) and 78 (L78F) in the VH domain. Such amino acid changes lead to a<br>
fully human antibody, variant hu504.32, for example, with Mold improved binding affinity for<br>
alpha4beta7 integrin. Furthermore, selected humanized antibodies described herein have been<br>
determined to have at least comparable biological activity as the parent rat Fib504 antibody (see<br>
Example 3 herein).<br>
Example 2: Additional humanized Fib504 HVR variants<br>
The HVR amino acid sequences of humanized variant Fib504.32 were further modified to<br>
generated additional variants capable of antagonizing the activity of beta7 integrin subunit and/or<br>
integrins containing the beta7 subunit.<br>
Generating a broad amino acid scan library- A library to scan selected HVR positions for<br>
115<br>
other amino acid residues capable of generating betaT-binding variants of variant hu504.32 was<br>
generated using 3 oligonucleotiies: 504-L1, designed to soft randomize a portion of HVR-L1 with a<br>
bias towards the hu504.32 HVR-L1 sequence (i.e. the sequence ASESVDDLLH (SEQ ID NO:47,<br>
for relative positions A2-Al 1) was soft randomized as described above); and HVR-L3 504-N96 and<br>
HVR-H3 504-M94 which introduce NNS at positions HVR-L3 position 96 in the light chain and<br>
HVR-H3 position 94 in the heavy chain, thus allowing all 20 amino acids at these positions. With<br>
these three oligonucleotides, the broad amino acid scan library was generated as described above<br>
using a template containing three stop codons in the light chain (positions 31 and 32 in HVR-L1 and<br>
position 96 in HVR-L3) and 1 stop codon in the heavy chain (position 94 in HVR-H3 ).<br>
Broad amino acid scan ofhu504-32 - To more fully explore the preferred sequences allowed in<br>
HVR-L1 and to enhance the stability of 504-32, we designed a phage library that a) soft randomized<br>
HVR-L1 of 504-32 hi the region where changes were observed (i.e. ASESVDDLLH (SEQ ID<br>
NO:47, for relative positions A2-Al 1) during humanization (Figure 1C), and b) allowed all possible<br>
amino acids at N96 in HVR-L3 and M94 in HVR-H3. Following 4 rounds of selection against<br>
immobilized full-length human integrin alpha4beta7 as described above, 96 random clones were<br>
selected for sequence analysis. The frequency at which amino acids were found at each position in<br>
the broad amino acid scan library suggest that the HVR-LI sequence present in hu504-32 and the<br>
methionine at position 94 in the heavy chain are optimum for high affinity binding (Figure 12). The<br>
most preferred amino acids obtained by the selections starting from variant 504.32 (Fig. 12) are<br>
shown in yellow. In contrast, although asparagine is present at position 96 in the light chain of<br>
hu504-32, the high frequency of leucine observed at this position in the broad amino acid scan<br>
suggests the mutation N96L could further improve the affinity of humanized Fib504 variants for<br>
alpha4beta7and also eliminate any potential deamidation problems at this position. The information<br>
in Figure 12 also suggests that a number of replacement amino acids are likely to be tolerated at<br>
most positions without a substantial loss in affinity. For example, to eliminate oxidation of M94 in<br>
HVR-H3, glutamine or arginine could likely be substituted.<br>
Generating the limited amino acid scan libraries - Six libraries for a limited amino acid scan<br>
utilized six different Kunkel templates, each containing one stop codon located within one of the six<br>
HVRs. Each library was generated using a single oligonucleotide encoding a single HVR and<br>
utilizing the codons listed in Fig. 11A ("codon" column) to alter amino acid residues for subsequent<br>
testing for binding to beta? or alpha4beta7. The same procedures are used to alter amino acid<br>
residues of anti-beta7 antibodies and test them for binding to alphaEbeta? integrins.<br>
Limited amino acid scan ofhu504-32 - The limited amino acid scan of hu504-16 was<br>
designed to make hu504-16 even more like the human light and heavy chain consensus sequence<br>
and in the process identify the minimal sequence elements of rat Fib504 that are required for<br>
binding. Six libraries were generated and targeted at each HVR at positions that differed between the<br>
hu504-16 and human consensus kappa I light or subgroup III heavy chains (Figure 1A and IB);<br>
either the rat or human amino acid was allowed at these positions in the library (Figure 11 A). In<br>
order to accommodate coding for both amino acids during the oligonucleotide synthesis and<br>
mutagenesis, additional amino acids were also introduced in some cases (see encoded amino acids,<br>
Figure 11A). The limited amino acid scan libraries were selected against immobilized full-length<br>
human integrin alpha4beta7as described above and approximately 32 random clones were<br>
sequenced from each library after round 3. The frequency of each amino acid found at each position<br>
is shown in Figure 1 IB and 11C.<br>
Like the broad amino acid scan, the limited amino acid scan also provides information about<br>
what changes are tolerated at many positions in humanized Fib504. Unlike the broad amino acid<br>
scan, however, the diversity allowed at each position randomized in the limited amino acid scan was<br>
restricted to a couple of amino acids. Thus the lack of any observed substitution at a given position<br>
does not indicate that a particular residue can not be changed nor does the high frequency of any<br>
particular amino acid at a given position necessarily indicate that it is the best solution for high<br>
affinity.<br>
At some positions (positions 27, 29, 30, 53, 54 of the light chain and 50, 54, 58, 60, 61, and 65<br>
of the heavy chain) the human consensus amino acid is selected quite frequently suggesting a back<br>
mutation to the human consensus would not dramatically alter binding to human alpha4beta7. In<br>
fact, at position 54 of the light chain (in HVR-L2), the human consensus amino acid is selected more<br>
frequently than the amino acid from rat Fib504 indicating that this change made to 504-32 provides<br>
a useful beta? binding antibody.<br>
Further, as a result of the library design, amino acids that are not derived from either the<br>
human consensus or rat Fib504 are selected more frequently at some positions and provide potential<br>
substitutions to improve the affinity of humanized Fib504 variants. These include, without<br>
limitation, D30A and I55V in the light chain and Y50F in the heavy chainThe results from these 2<br>
libraries indicate that many HVR positions tolerate other amino acid substitutions and still retain<br>
comparable biological acitivity.<br>
Summaries of observed amino acid changes are shown in Figures 13 and 15. Figure 15<br>
summarizes the various amino acids useful at each of the positions in the CDRs of the antibody<br>
variants of the invention at positions numbered according to Kabat numbering or a relative<br>
numbering system. Each of the additional antibodies encompassed by the variants depicted in<br>
Figures 13 and 15 is an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Example 3: Cell Adhesion Assays<br>
The ability of some of the humanized Fib504 variants of the invention to bind ligands<br>
expressed on a cell surface was tested by cell adhesion assays. Binding to alpha4beta7 and another<br>
beta7 integrin, alphaEbeta7 were tested by the ability of the humanized variants to disrupt binding of<br>
the integrin to its natural receptor. Binding of the humanized Fib504 variants to beta? subunit alone<br>
expressed on a cell surface was similarly tested. The procedures and the results are described below.<br>
IgG production - Humanized Fib 504 IgG variants were expressed transiently in 293 cells (Graham<br>
et al. (1977) supra) using a separate vector for the light and heavy chains. The vectors were<br>
constructed by subcloning the light or heavy variable domains into suitable expression vectors for<br>
each of the light and heavy chains. Supernatant from 1.1 L CHO cell culture of a humanized Fib504<br>
variant was filtered through a 0.45 urn filter and applied to a new 1 mL HiTrap Protein A HP<br>
column (Amersham/Pharmacia) equilibrated in Buffer A (10 mM tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl).<br>
Samples were applied at 0.8 mL/min, overnight, 4 degrees C. Each column was then washed and<br>
equilibrated with 30 mL Buffer A. Elution of antibody was accomplished by chromatography at<br>
room temperature on an FPLC (Amersham/Pharmacia) using a linear gradient of 14 min at 1<br>
mL/min from 0 to 100% Buffer B (100 mM Glycine, pH 3.0). Resulting 1 mL fractions were<br>
immediately neutralized by the addition of 75 uL 1 M tris, pH 8. Eluted protein was detected by<br>
absorption at 280 run, and peak fractions were pooled and desalted into PBS on PD10 G-25<br>
sephadex disposable sizing columns (Amersham/Pharmacia). Protein was detected by OD280 and<br>
peak fractions were pooled. The antibody in PBS was 0.22 urn filtered and stored at 4 degrees C.<br>
Amino acid analysis was used to quantify the concentrations of these purified antibodies, and values<br>
were assigned from the average of two separate determinations.<br>
BCECF labeling:<br>
In each of the assays presented in this Example 3, cells were labeled according to the<br>
following procedure. All cells used in the adhesion assays were labeled with 2', 7'-bis-(2-<br>
carboxylethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF) at 10 uM in RPMI1640<br>
media containing 10%FBS for RPMI8866 cells and 38C13 cells transfected with beta7 subunit<br>
(38C13 beta7 cells) and in F-12:DMEM mix (50:50) containing 10% FBS for alphaEbeta7-<br>
transfected 293 cells (alphaEbeta? 293 cells). Cells were labeled for 30 minutes and washed two<br>
times with assay media. Cell density was adjusted to 3 xlO6 cells per ml for RPMI8866 and<br>
38C13beta7 cells and 2.2 x 106 cells per ml for alphaEbeta7 293 cells.<br>
Humanized Fib504 variants disrupt alpha4beta7 binding to MAdCAM<br>
RPMI8866/MAdCAM-l-Ig Cell Adhesion: RPMI8866 cells express alpha4beta7 on their<br>
surface (Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY). Humanized Fib504 variants (hu504<br>
variants) were contacted with a mixture of RMPI8866 cells and MAdCAM fused to IgG coated on a<br>
solid support. Humanized Fib504 variant concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition (ICso) of the<br>
binding of RPMI8866 cells to MAdCAM-1 were measured by coating Nunc Maxisorp™ 96-well<br>
plates with 2 ug/ml in PBS, 100 ul/well MAdCAM- 1-Ig (Genentech, Inc., where Ig refers to fusion<br>
of MAdCAM-1 to an Fc region) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking the plates with 200 ul/well of 5<br>
mg/ml BSA for one hour at room temperature, 50 \i 1 of humanized Fib504 variants in assay media<br>
 (RPMI1640 media, Hyclone®, Logan Utah, USA, supplemented with 5 mg/mL BSA) were added<br>
to each well and 150,000 BCECF-labeled cells (BCECF, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 50 ul of<br>
assay media were added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C. The wells were washed<br>
two times with 150 ul of assay media to remove unbound cells. The bound cells were solubilized<br>
with 100 ul of 0.1% SDS in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH7.5. The amount of fluorescence released from<br>
lysed cells was measured by SPECTRAmax GEMINI™ (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 485<br>
nm excitation 530 nm emission wavelengths. The fluorescence values were analyzed as a function<br>
of the concentrations of the humanized Fib504 variants added in each assay, using a four-parameter<br>
nonlinear least squares fit, to obtain the IGo values of each humanized Fib504 variant in the assay.<br>
IC50 and 1C 90 values were estimated from the four-parameter fit. Fig. 14 is an exemplary plot of the<br>
*Exp 1/Exp 2 refers to the results of repeated assays.<br>
Humanized Fib504 variant disruption of alpha4beta7 binding to VCAM<br>
RPMI8866/7dVCAM-l Cell Adhesion: The RPMI8866/7dVCAM-1 assay is similar format<br>
to the RPMI8866/MAdCAM- 1-Ig except that 7dVCAM-l (ADP5, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis,<br>
MM) was used at 2 ug/ml to coat plates. The results were analyzed as des cribed above for the<br>
MAdCAM binding experiments. The IC5o values for each of the variants tested are shown below in<br>
Humanized Fib504 variant disruption of alphaEbeta? binding to human E-cadherin<br>
AlphaEbeta7293/huE-Cadherin Cell Adhesion: 293 cells (Graham et al. (1977) supra) were<br>
transfected with alphaE and beta7 (Genentech, Inc.). The assay format is similar to the<br>
RPMI8866/MAdCAM-l-Ig assay except that the huE-Cadherin (648-EC, R&amp;D Systems,<br>
Minneapolis, MM) was used at 2 ng/ml to coat the plates. Plates were then blocked with 5 mg/ml<br>
BSA as mentioned above and 50 ul of FIB504 variants in assay media (F-12:DMEM (50:50)<br>
supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA) were add to each well and 110,000 BCECF labeled cells in 50 ul<br>
of assay media were added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C. The wells were<br>
washed two times with 150 ul of assay media and the amount of fluorescence released by lysed cells<br>
was measured and analyzed as described above. Assay results from three experiments are shown in<br>
Humanized Fib504 variant disruption of beta? binding to MAdCAM<br>
38C13beta7/muMAdCAM-l-Ig Cell Adhesion Assay: The 38C13beta7/muMAdCAM-l-Ig<br>
assay was similar format to the RPMI8866/MAdCAM-l-Ig except that muMAdCAM-1-Ig<br>
(Genentech, Inc.) was used at 2 ug/ml to coat plates. 38C13 alpha4+ murine lymphoma cells<br>
(Crowe, D.T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:14411-14418 (1994)) were transfected with DNA encoding<br>
integrin beta7 such that alpha4beta7 was expressed on the cell surface. The ability of the antibodies<br>
variants to disrupt interaction between the cell membrane associated alpha4beta7 and MAdCAM<br>
was performed as above. Assay results are shown in Table 7. Assay results are shown in Table 7.<br>
(IC50 and IC90 values for 2 experiments are shown).<br>
Humanized Fib504 variant disruption of beta7 binding to murine VCAM<br>
38C13beta7/muVCAM-l-Ig Cell Adhesion Assay: The 38C13beta7/muVCAM -1 -Ig assay<br>
was performed according to the murine MAdCAM-l-Ig/RPMI8866 cell binding assay above, except<br>
that muVCAM- 1-Ig (Genentech, Inc.) was used at 2 ng/ml to coat plates. Results of the assay are<br>
shown in Table 8. (IC50 and IC90 values for 2 experiments are shown).<br>
The results of the humanized Fib504 variant binding studies demonstrate that the humanized<br>
antibody of the invention binds its target beta? integrin subunit as well as the alpha4beta7 and<br>
alphaEbeta7 integrin with about the affinity of the starting rat antibody and, in some embodiments,<br>
with greater affinity. Thus, a humanized anti-beta7 antibody according to the invention has uses in<br>
anti-beta7 integrin therapies, particularly human therapies.<br>
Relative activity of hu5Q4.32 variants of the invention<br>
Different amino acid variants of the hu504.32 antibody were tested in human and mouse cell<br>
adhesion assay for their ability to inhibit beta7-containing receptor binding to its ligand according to<br>
the cell adhesion assay methods disclosed herein. The RPMI8866/MAdCAM-l-Fc assay was<br>
performed as described herein above The a^haEbeta7-293/hu E-cadherein assay was modified by<br>
the use of human E-cadherin-Fc as the ligand (human E-cadherin-Fc, 648-EC, R&amp;D Systems,<br>
Minneapolis, MM). The relative ability of hu504.32 variants to inhibit interaction of human<br>
fibronectin (huFN40) with human alpha4beta7 receptor on PRMI8866 cells was also examined. The<br>
RPMI8866/hu Fibronectin (huFN40) assay used for these studies was similar in format to the<br>
RPMI8866/MAdCAM-l-Ig assay disclosed herein except that human fibronectin alphachymotryptic<br>
fragment 40 kDa (F1903, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was used at 2<br>
Hg/ml to coat plates.<br>
The ability of the hu504.32 variants to inhibit interaction of murine beta7-containing<br>
receptors with murine MAdCAM-1 or murine VCAM-1 was examined. Murine MAdCAM-1-Fc<br>
and murine VCAM-1-Fc were inhibited from interacting with murine Iymphomaalpha4+ cells<br>
expressing murine beta? (38C13beta7 cells) by the hu504.32 variants. The murine MAdCAM- 1-Fc<br>
and VCAM-1-Fc cell adhesion assays were performed similarly to those described herein above for<br>
human MAdCAM and VCAM. Where ligands were fused to Fc regions, the Fc receptors on the<br>
cells were blocked with 0.5 ug anti-CD 16/32 antibody (anti-Fcgamma III/II receptor antibody,<br>
catalog No. 553142, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) perl million cells for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature. 150,000 labeled cells in 50 nl of assay medium were added to each well and incubated<br>
for 13 minutes at 37 °C. The wells were washed and the amount of fluorescence released from lysed<br>
cells was measured as disclosed herein above. The control antibody for the human cell adhesion<br>
assays was the mouse monoclonal antibody to human serum albumin, 6B11 (Catalog No. ab 10244,<br>
Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA). The control antibody for the murine cell adhesion assays<br>
was the rat anti-mouse integrin beta? antibody, M293 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), which does<br>
not compete with ligand or with Fib504 for binding to integrin beta?.<br>
The results of triplicate assays for the human and murine cell adhesion assays are provided<br>
in Tables 9 and 10, respectively.<br>
The hu504.32 antibody has a methionine at position 94 of the heavy chain CDR3. The<br>
variants M94Q (or hu504.32Q) and M94R (or hu504.32R) have glutamine or arginine, respectively,<br>
at position 94 of the hu504.32 antibody variant. The hu504.32M, Q, and R antibodies substantially<br>
reduced integrin beta? receptor-ligand interaction in in each of the assays and are, thus, potent<br>
inhibitors of betaT-mediated cell adhesion.<br>
Antibody hu504.32R Activity In Vivo<br>
The hu504.32R antibody variant was tested in vivo for its ability to reduce integrin beta7<br>
receptor-ligand interaction and reduce lymphocyte recruitment to inflamed colon in an in vivo<br>
murine inflammatory bowel disease model. BALB/c mice and CB17 SCID mice were obtained<br>
from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Wilmington, MA, USA). CD4*CD45Rb high T<br>
cell reconsituted SCID colitic mice were prepared by isolating CD4+CD45Rb high T cells from<br>
donor BALB/c mice and transferring 3x1$ cells in 100 ul PBS intravenously. Control SCID mice<br>
did not receive CD4+CD45Rb high T cells. Reconstituted CD4+ mice meeting the treatment group<br>
enrollment criteria of 10% weight loss from baseline or 15% from peak weight at week 4 were<br>
considered to have induced inflammatory bowel disease and were selected for treatment.<br>
On the day of treatment with test antibodies, donor BALB/c mice mesenteric lymph node<br>
(MLN) cells were harvested and radiolabelled with Cr51. Treatment involved prior administration of<br>
anti-GP120 antibody, hu504.32 anti-beta? antibody, hu504.32R anti-beta? antibody, or no antibody<br>
(control) intravenously, 200 ug/100 ul PBS. Thirty minutes after antibody administration, Cr51-<br>
labelled MLN cells were injected, 4xl06 cells/100 ul. One hour post-injection of labelled cells, mice<br>
were euthanized and spleen, colon, and peyers patch were collected, weighed, and total Cr5'<br>
radioactivity per organ was determined. Figure 16 is a bar graph of the results of these tests<br>
showing the relative ability of the antibodies to block homing of radiolabelled T cells to the colon of<br>
mice experiencing inflammatory bowel disease. Homing of T cells to inflamed colon was inhibited<br>
by hu504.32 and hu504.32R anti-beta? antibodies relative to negative control, anti-GP120 antibody.<br>
Distribution to spleen was similar for all of the antibodies. Thus, the hu504.32 and hu504.32R anti-<br>
beta7 antibodies effectively inhibit homing of T cells to inflamed colon in vivo.<br>
Antibody glycation does not affect the ability of hu504.32R variant to block MAdCAM-1<br>
binding to alpha4beta7 receptor.<br>
Glycation, the non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins, can affect antibody- ligand<br>
interactions (see, for example, Kennedy, D.M. et al., Clin Exp Immunol. 98(2):245-51 (1994).<br>
Glycation of lysine at position 49 of the 504.32R Glycation of the lysine at light chain position 49<br>
of the hu504.32R variant (HVR-L2 relative position Bl) was observed but had no significant affect<br>
on the ability of the antibody variant to block the binding of MAdCAM-1 to alpha4beta7 receptorexpressing<br>
RPMI8866 cells. Determination of glycation and glycation levels was performed using<br>
standard elctrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (EStMS) and by boronate affinity<br>
chromatography. Boronate affinity HPLC methods useful to test for glycation are found at, for<br>
example, Quan C.P. et al., Analytical Chemistry 71(20):4445-4454 (1999) and Li Y.C. et al., J.<br>
Chromatography A, 909:137-145 (2001). The cell adhesion assay was performed according to the<br>
RPMJ8866/MAdCAM-l-Fc cell adhesion assay disclosed herein.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the invention, glycation at position 49 is reduced or<br>
eliminated where position 49 comprises an amino acid other than lysine. The polypeptide or<br>
antibody of the invention encompasses as an amino acid at position 49 (HVR-L2 relative position<br>
Bl) any of amino acids A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, or Y, where each letter<br>
refers to a amino acid according to the standard single-letter amino acid designation. Alternatively,<br>
the amino acid at position 49 of the light chain of a 504.32R variant (or other 504 variant) is selected<br>
from the group consisting of R, N, V, A, F, Q, H, P, I, or L An amino acid useful at position 49 is<br>
selected, for example, by displaying (preparing a phage library of) the hu504.32R Fab on phage<br>
(variant) and substituting separately, at the codon for position 49, a codon for each of the 20<br>
naturally occurring amino acids. Phage expressing the hu504.32R variants altered at position 49 are<br>
tested for binding to integrin beta? and/or to a receptor comprising integrin beta?, such as<br>
alpha4beta? or alphaEbeta? receptors. Those variants which bind to beta? integrin or the<br>
alpha4beta? or alphaEbeta? receptors are further screened for the ability to inhibit integrin beta?<br>
receptor-ligand binding and in vivo efficacy as described herein. Alternative, naturally or nonnaturally<br>
occurring amino acids may be svbstituted at position 49 by standard mutagenesis<br>
techniques and tested in the cell adhesion and in vivo assays described herein. Alternatively, the<br>
amino acid at position 49 of the light chain is an amino acid other than lysine (K), and amino acids<br>
at any other HVR or framework position or positions in the light chain and/or heavy chain is altered<br>
to select for a variant anti-beta? binding polypeptide or antibody that exhibits binding affinity, in<br>
vitro and in vivo biological activity, pharmacokinetics, drug clearance and immunogenicity useful<br>
for reduction of inflammation by reducing the biological activity of integrin beta?. Mutagenesis and<br>
selection of such a polypeptide or antibody variant is performed as disclosed herein and according to<br>
other standard techniques. Such a variant anti-beta? binding polypeptide or antibody exhibits<br>
124<br>
integrin beta? binding affinity within 10,000-fold, 1000-fold, alternatively within 100-fold,<br>
alternatively within 10-fold, alternatively within 5-fold, alternatively within 2-fold of the binding<br>
affinity exhibited by the any of the humanized Fib504 variants disclosed herein.<br>
