DESCRIPTION<br>
THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANE TAPE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic<br>
polyurethane tape having a good elastic function.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
A polyurethane tape has excellent stretchability,<br>
for example, has a strength equal to rubber despite being<br>
thinner and lighter than rubber, and has high wear<br>
resistance, and is excellent in weather resistance and<br>
oil resistance compared with rubber. Therefore, a<br>
polyurethane tape is widely used for inner garments,<br>
outer garments, sports garments, garment materials and<br>
the like.<br><br>
However, more improvements are being demanded for<br>
various elastic functions. For example, when a<br>
polyurethane tape is used for a fastening part at the end<br>
of underwear, undergarments, sportswear, such as swimwear<br>
and leotards, T-shirts, polo shirts and the like or when<br>
used as a reinforcement of cloth for the purpose of<br>
suppressing droop at the shoulder part of a cut/sew<br>
garment in place of a cotton or braided tape, there is a<br>
problem that due to poor recoverability during repeated<br>
wearing, the clothing fabric remains uneven after<br>
disrobing, i.e., it is demanded to improve the elastic<br>
recoverability as an elastic function at room<br>
temperature. In use as a reinforcing tape of cold-<br>
weather garment such as outdoor wear, reduction in the<br>
elastic function at low temperatures is a problem.<br>
A polyether is often used as the soft segment<br><br>
component of a polyurethane resin. Above all, a<br>
polyurethane resin using polytetramethylene ether glycol<br>
(hereinafter simply referred to as PTMG) which is a<br>
polymer of tetrahydrofuran (hereinafter simply referred<br>
to as THF) is excellent in the elastic property, low-<br>
temperature property, hydrolysis resistance and the like<br>
and therefore, is being used in various fields. However,<br>
a tape obtained from the polyurethane resin using PTMG is<br>
reduced in the elastic functions resulting from<br>
crystallization of the soft segment at the stretching.<br><br>
For the purpose of improving these elastic<br>
functions, various efforts have been made with an attempt<br>
to suppress the crystallinity of the soft segment in the<br>
polyurethane by using various diols, but there are no<br>
publications that describe a polyurethane that has<br>
succeeded in enhancing the above-described elastic<br>
functions to a sufficiently satisfactory level.<br>
For example, there are four publications describing<br>
use of a copolymerization-type polyether polyol as the<br>
soft segment of the polyurethane. Patent Document 1<br>
describes a polyether glycol in which 4.2 mol% of a<br>
neopentyl glycol group is copolymerized, and Patent<br>
Document 2 describes a polyurethane using a 3.4 mol%<br>
copolymerized polyether glycol, but these polymers have a<br>
low copolymerization ratio and a polyurethane remarkably<br>
enhanced in the mechanical property when formed into a<br>
tape or film shape, such as strength, elongation and<br>
elastic recovery percentage, is not disclosed.<br>
Furthermore, Patent Document 3 describes a polyurethane<br>
using a copolymerized polyol of THF and 3-alkyl<br>
tetrahydrofuran but is silent about the stretch and<br>
recoverability in expansion and contraction, and Patent<br>
Document 4 describes improvement of elastic functions of<br>
a copolymerized polyurethane containing from 8 to 85 mol%<br>
of neopentyl glycol group and/or 3-methyl-1,5-<br><br>
pentanediol; however, a thermoplastic polyurethane is not<br>
disclosed.<br>

part at the end of outdoor wear employed at low<br>
temperatures, which has been conventionally impossible,<br>
is enabled.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is an example of the S-S curve drawn when the<br>
thermoplastic polyurethane tape of the present invention<br>
is stretched and then recovered.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is specifically described<br>
below.<br>
The present invention relates to a tape comprising a<br>
thermoplastic polyurethane. The term "thermoplastic" as<br>
used herein means to have a reversible property of<br>
becoming flowable under heating at a temperature not more<br>
than the decomposition temperature and being solidified<br>
upon cooling. Generally, a polyurethane resin starts<br>
decomposing at 230°C or more.<br>
The thermoplastic polyurethane tape of the present<br>
invention is characterized in that the residual strain<br>
after 300% stretching at 20°C is 40% or less. If the<br>
residual strain exceeds 40%, the clothing fabric<br><br>
stretched at wearing is not recovered and looks ugly due<br>
to uneven droop remaining on the surface. The residual<br>
strain is more preferably 30% or less, still more<br>
preferably 25% or less. The lower limit is preferably as<br>
small as possible, but in view of production or cost, is<br>
about 5%.<br>
In the thermoplastic polyurethane tape of the<br>
present invention, the recovery percentage after<br>
repeating a 300% stretching/recovery cycle at -10°C three<br>
times is preferably 85% or more. If the recovery<br>
percentage is less than 85%, when the tape is used for<br>
fastening at the end of outdoor wear, weak fastening<br>
disadvantageously results due to bad recovery of the<br>
clothing fabric. The recovery percentage is more<br>
preferably 90% or more. The upper limit is preferably as<br>
large as possible, but in view of production or cost, is<br>
about 99%.<br>
In the thermoplastic polyurethane tape of the<br>
present invention, in addition to the above-described<br>
stretching and recovery performance, the stress at an<br>
elongation of 100%, that is indicative of the power at<br>
stretching, is preferably from 3.0 to 6.0 MPa. If the<br>
stress is less than 3.0 MPa, when the tape is used as a<br>
fastening material at the end of a garment or as a<br>
reinforcement of clothing fabric, the fastening<br>
performance or reinforcing performance is poor, whereas<br>
if the stress exceeds 6.0 MPa, the fastening force<br>
becomes too strong and the tape is sometimes unsuited for<br>
use in practice. The stress is more preferably from 3.2<br>
to 5.8 MPa, still more preferably from 3.5 to 5.5 MPa.<br>
In the case where the thus-obtained polyurethane<br>
tape is used as a reinforcement of clothing fabric, the<br>
tape is in many cases heat adherent to the fabric by<br>
using a hot press or the like. In order to keep the<br><br>
power as a reinforcement even after heat adhesion, the<br>
thermoplastic polyurethane tape of the present invention<br>
preferably has an MFR (melt flow rate) of 15 to 25, more<br>
preferably from 17 to 24, still more preferably from 18<br>
to 23. If the MFR is less than 15, the heat adherent<br>
force is insufficient, whereas if it exceeds 25, the<br>
power is lacking. The MFR is indicative of flowability<br>
(shear viscosity) under given conditions and can be<br>
measured by a melt indexer described later. When MFR is<br>
in the range above, excellent elastic functions can be<br>
suitably brought out.<br><br>
In the present invention, as described above, a<br>
polyurethane containing a structure obtained by reacting<br>
(i) an organic polyisocyanate compound and (ii) a<br>
polyalkylene ether diol may be used. Furthermore, (iii)<br>
an active hydrogen-containing compound that reacts with<br>
an isocyanate group may be used as a chain extender.<br><br>
The polyalkylene ether diol (ii) for use in the<br>
present invention preferably comprises structural units<br>
represented by structural formula (A) and structural<br>
formulae (B) and has a composition satisfying formula<br>
(1), i.e., contains from 8 to 45 mol% of a segment having<br>
a methyl group in the side chain. When the segment<br>
having a methyl group in the side chain accounts for from<br>
8 to 45 mol%, a thermoplastic polyurethane tape excellent<br>
in various elastic functions, for example, elongation at<br>
break and elastic recoverability, can be suitably<br>
obtained. The composition is more preferably in a range<br>
represented by the following formula (2):<br>
0.09 ≤ MB/(MA+MB) ≤ 0.30 (2)<br><br>
This specific polyalkylene ether diol is produced by<br>
reacting THF and neopentyl glycol or its dehydrated<br>
cyclic low-molecular compound, for example, 3,3-<br>
dimethyloxetane, according to the method described in<br><br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 61-123628<br>
while using a heteropolyacid with a controlled hydration<br>
number as a catalyst. The copolymerized diol can be<br>
easily produced by variously changing the method and<br>
conditions of reaction to give predetermined molecular<br>
weight, copolymerization component constitution and<br>
copolymerization ratio.<br>
Incidentally, the neopentyl glycol unit constituting<br>
the diol may be distributed in either random or block<br>
manner with respect to the tetramethylene unit. In the<br>
reaction using a heteropolyacid catalyst, the units can<br>
be distributed in either block or random manner, and the<br>
crystallinity of the diol can be changed variously, so<br>
that a diol having desired crystallinity can be produced<br>
according the property of the polyurethane.<br><br>
The number average molecular weight of the<br>
polyalkylene ether diol for use in the present invention<br>
is preferably from 300 to 30,000, more preferably from<br>
500 to 5,000, still more preferably from 900 to 2,000.<br>
If the number average molecular weight is less than 300,<br>
the tape decreases in the elongation and cannot be<br>
stretched at wearing, whereas if the number average<br>
molecular weight exceeds 30,000, the strength of the tape<br>
decreases and this is a problem.<br>
The polyalkylene ether diol for use in the present<br>
invention may be used as a mixture or in combination, in<br>
an arbitrary ratio, with other diols having a number<br>
average molecular weight of approximately from 250 to<br>
20,000, for example, with a homopolyether diol such as<br>
polyoxyethylene glycol, polyoxypropylene glycol,<br>
polyoxytetramethylene glycol and polyoxypentamethylene<br>
glycol, a copolymerized polyether diol formed from two or<br>
more oxyalkylenes each having a carbon number of 2 to 6,<br>
a polyester diol obtained from one species or two or more<br><br>
species of a dibasic acid such as adipic acid, sebacic<br>
acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, azelaic acid and<br>
malonic acid, and one species or two or more species of a<br>
glycol such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol,<br>
1, 3-propylene glycol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, 1,4-<br>
butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, hexamethylene glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, 1,10-decanediol, 1,3-<br>
dimethylolcyclohexane and 1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane, a<br>
polyesteramide diol, a polyester ether diol, a<br>
polylactone diol such as poly-s-caprolactone diol and<br>
polyvalerolactone diol, a polycarbonate diol, a polyacryl<br>
diol, a polythioether diol, a polythioester diol, or a<br>
copolymerized product of such diols.<br><br>
Examples of the organic polyisocyanate compound (i)<br>
include a compound having at least two or more isocyanate<br>
groups within the molecule, such as 4,4'-diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate, methylene-bis(4-phenyl isocyanate),<br>
methylene-bis(3-methyl-4-phenyl isocyanate), 2,4-tolylene<br>
diisocyanate, 2,6-tolylene diisocyanate, m- or p-xylylene<br>
diisocyanate, α,α,α',α'-tetramethyl-xylylene<br>
diisocyanate, m- or p-phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-<br>
dimethyl-1,3-xylylene diisocyanate, 1-alkylphenylene-2, 4-<br>
or 2, 6-diisocyanate, 3- (α-isocyanatoethyl) phenyl<br>
isocyanate, 2,6-diethylphenylene-1,4-diisocyanate,<br>
diphenyl-dimethylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate, diphenylether-<br>
4,4'-diisocyanate, naphthylene-1,5-diisocyanate, 1,6-<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate, methylene-bis(4-cyclohexyl<br>
isocyanate), 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexylene diisocyanate,<br>
trimethylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate,<br>
pentamethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate<br>
and isophorone diisocyanate.<br>
Examples of the active hydrogen-containing compound<br>
(iii) that reacts with an isocyanate group include: (a) a<br>
low molecular weight glycol such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-<br><br>
propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 2,2-dimethyl-1, 3-<br>
propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
hexamethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,10-decanediol,<br>

hydrazine; (b) a compound having a linear or branched,<br>
aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic, active hydrogen-<br>
containing amino group having a carbon number of 2 to 10,<br>
such as ethylenediamine, 1,2-propylenediamine,<br>
trimethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, hydrazine,<br>
carbodihydrazide, adipic acid dihydrazide and sebacic<br>
acid dihydrazide; (c) a monofunctional amino compound<br>
such as secondary amine, that is, dimethylamine,<br>
methylethylamine, diethylamine, methyl-n-propylamine,<br>
methyl-isopropylamine, diisopropylamine, methyl-n-<br>
butylamine, methyl-isobutylamine and methylisoamylamine;<br>
(d) water; (e) a polyalkylene ether diol defined in (ii)<br>
above; (f) known diols having a number average molecular<br>
weight of approximately from 250 to 5,000; and (g)<br>
monohydric alcohols. Diols are preferred, and 1,4-<br>
butanediol and/or a dialkylene glycol having a carbon<br>
number of 4 to 8 are more preferred.<br><br>
The organic polyisocyanate and active hydrogen-<br>
containing compound for use in the present invention each<br>
may be used alone, or some may be previously mixed, if<br>
desired, and then used.<br><br>
As for the operation of polyurethanation reaction,<br>
known techniques for polyurethanation reaction are used.<br>
For example, the polyalkylene ether diol (ii) and the<br>
organic polyisocyanate compound (i) may be reacted in a<br>
ratio of preferably from 1:1.5 to 1:3.5, more preferably<br>
from 1:1.8 to 1:3.0, still more preferably from 1:1.9 to<br>
1:2.7 (equivalent ratio), under the conditions of an<br>
excess organic polyisocyanate compound to synthesize a<br>
urethane prepolymer, and the active hydrogen-containing<br>
compound (iii) that reacts with an isocyanate group may<br><br>
be added and reacted with the isocyanate group in the<br>
prepolymer. Alternatively, the organic polyisocyanate<br>
compound (i), the polyalkylene ether diol (ii) and the<br>
active hydrogen-containing compound (iii) that reacts<br>
with an isocyanate group may be reacted by a one-shot<br>
polymerization method of simultaneously reacting these in<br>
one step. These are reacted such that the isocyanate<br>
group of the organic polyisocyanate compound becomes<br>
nearly equivalent to the total of the hydroxyl group of<br>
the polyalkylene ether diol and the active hydrogen of<br>
the active hydrogen-containing compound that reacts with<br>
an isocyanate.<br>
The polymer obtained by the chain extension reaction<br>
may be adjusted to a viscosity suitable for melt<br>
extrusion by performing a heat treatment (annealing) at a<br>
temperature of approximately from 80 to 180°C.<br>
In the reaction above, a catalyst, a stabilizer and<br>
the like may be added, if desired. Examples of the<br>
catalyst include triethylamine, tributylamine, dibutyltin<br>
dilaurate and stannous octylate, and examples of the<br>
stabilizer include other compounds usually used in the<br>
polyurethane resin, such as ultraviolet absorbent,<br>
antioxidant, light stabilizer, gas-resistant stabilizer,<br>
antistatic agent, colorant, matting agent and filler.<br><br>
The thus-obtained polyurethane can be formed into a<br>
tape by a known thermoplastic polyurethane extrusion<br>
molding. In the extrusion molding, for example, the film<br>
may be extruded directly in a tape shape by using a slit<br>
die or the film may be once extruded in a wide sheet<br>
shape by using a T-die and then cut into a tape shape<br>
having a predetermined width.<br>
In extrusion molding into a tape shape, the<br>
polyurethane may be cold drawn or hot drawn. The<br>
polyurethane after spinning may be directly drawn or may<br>
be once taken up and then drawn in a separate step. The<br><br>
draw ratio is preferably from 2 to 8 times, more<br>
preferably from 3 to 7 times.<br>
The thickness of the tape is usually on the order of<br>
0.02 to 0.5 mm.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is specifically described<br>
below. Although the present invention is described in<br>
greater detail by referring to Examples, the present<br>
invention is not limited only to these Examples. The<br>
measured values in Examples and the like are a value<br>
determined by the following measuring methods.<br><br>
Measurement of Residual Strain and Recovery<br>
Percentage:<br>
Using a tensile tester (UTM-III Model 100, trade<br>
name, manufactured by ORIENTEC Co., LTD.), a tape having<br>
a width of 0.6 cm and a length of 5 cm was stretched at a<br>
rate of 50 cm/min under the conditions of 20°C and -10°C<br>
and then recovered, and the change in the stress-strain<br>
was measured.<br>
Fig. 1 shows S-S curves at the first and third<br>
stretching/recovery operations. L1 is a maximum<br>
elongation (300%) when stretched, and L2 is an elongation<br>
when the stress of the S-S curve at the first operation<br>
becomes 0. L3 denotes an elongation when the stress in<br>
the S-S curve at the third operation becomes 0.<br>
The residual stain is indicated by the elongation of<br>
L2 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The recovery percentage after repeating 300%<br>
stretching and recovery three time is represented by the<br>

Measurement of MFR (JIS K 7210 (1995):<br>
Using a melt indexer, Model S-101, manufactured by<br><br>
Toyo Seiki Seisaku-Sho, Ltd., the measurement was<br>
performed at 190°C under a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
Measurement of Stress at Elongation of 100%:<br>
Using a tensile tester (UTM-III Model 100, trade<br>
name, manufactured by ORIENTEC Co., LTD.), a tape having<br>
a width of 0.6 cm and a length of 5 cm was stretched at a<br>
rate of 50 cm/min at 20°C, and the stress-stain was<br>
measured. The value obtained by dividing the measured<br>
value at an elongation of 100% by the cross-sectional<br>
area of the tape is taken as the stress.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
As the polyalkylene ether diol (ii), PTXG1800<br>
produced by Asahi Kasei Fibers Corp. was used. The<br>
copolymerization composition MB/(MA+MB) of PTXG1800 was<br>
0.1. In a nitrogen gas stream, 1,400 g of this PTXG and<br>
389.4 g of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate were reacted<br>
under stirring at 80°C for 180 minutes to obtain a<br>
polyurethane prepolymer having an isocyanate group at<br>
both terminals. This prepolymer was then rapidly cooled<br>
to 25°C, and 35 g of 1,4-butanediol was added to the<br>
prepolymer and stirred for 30 minutes. A polyurethane<br>
having a viscosity of 117,000 mPa.s (25°C) was obtained.<br><br>
The polyurethane obtained was mixed with 9 g of AO-<br>
60 produced by Adeka Corp. as an antioxidant and 9 g of<br>
LA-36 produced by Adeka Corp. as a yellowing inhibitor<br>
and then discharged to a Teflon (registered trademark)<br>
tray.<br>
The polyurethane in the Teflon (registered<br>
trademark) tray was annealed in a hot air oven at 130°C<br>
for 3 hours to obtain a polyurethane resin. This<br>
polyurethane resin had a Shore A hardness of 71, an MFR<br>
of 5.0 and a thermoplastic property.<br><br><br>
The polyurethane resin obtained above was ground<br>
into a powder having a diameter of about 3 mm by a<br>
grinder, Model UG-280, manufactured by Horai K.K.<br>
This polyurethane resin powder was melt-extruded<br>
into a shaped form by a twin-screw extruder, KZW15TW-<br>
45HG, manufactured by TECHNOVEL Corp. The melt was<br>
extruded into a film shape at a discharge rate of 12.4<br>
g/min from a T-die with a width of 150 mm and a lip width<br>
of 1.0 mm at a die temperature of 200°C. The film was<br>
taken up by a metal roll cooled to 15°C, at a roll speed<br>
of 0.5 m/min to obtain a film having a thickness of 250<br>
µm.<br>
This film was subjected to slitting to obtain a tape<br>
of 6 mm in width. The MFR of this tape was 1.8.<br>
The residual strain of this tape after 300%<br>
stretching at 20°C was 24% and good. Also, the recovery<br>
percentage after repeating 300% stretching/recovery at<br>
-10°C three times was 92% and good.<br>
The stress of this tape at an elongation of 100% was<br>
3.1 MPa.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
The polyurethane resin powder obtained in Example 1<br>
was melt-extruded into a shaped form by a twin-screw<br>

rate of 12.4 g/min from a T-die with a width of 150 mm<br>
and a lip width of 1.0 mm at a die temperature of 200°C.<br>
The film was taken up by a metal roll cooled to 15°C, at a<br>
roll speed of 0.5 m/min to obtain a film having a<br>
thickness of 250 µm.<br>
This film was subjected to slitting to obtain a tape<br>
of 6 mm in width. The obtained tape was fixed to a<br>
expanding instrument in a state of being cold drawn at<br>
ratio of four, and heat-treated in a hot air oven at 70°C<br>
for 30 minutes.<br><br>
The residual strain of this tape after 300%<br>
stretching at 20°C was 18% and good. The stress of this<br>
tape at an elongation of 100% was 4.02 MPa.<br>
