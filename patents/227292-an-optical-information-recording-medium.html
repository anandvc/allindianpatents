				<td>The present invention relates to an optical<br>
information recording medium utilizing a crystalline state<br>
as a non-recorded state and an amorphous state as a<br>
recorded state, which employs a phase-change recording<br>
layer comprising an alloy. Particularly, it<br>
relates to a phase-change recording material used for an<br>
information recording medium on which a high speed<br>
recording/erasing is possible, and an information<br>
recording medium employing the phase-change recording<br>
material. Further, it relates to an information<br>
recording medium of which initial crystallization is<br>
easily carried out, which has a high signal amplitude,<br>
which is excellent in repetitive overwriting properties,<br>
which is excellent in storage stability and which has<br>
excellent jitter properties at a high transfer rate<br>
recording.<br>
As a rewritable information recording medium, a<br><br>
method has been known wherein the crystal structure of a<br>
metal or a semiconductor is reversibly changed by<br>
affecting energy beams or an energy flow such as light or<br>
electric current (Joule heating) (J. Feinleib et a1.<br>
"RAPID REVERSIBLE LIGHT-INDUCED CRYSTALLIZATION OF<br>
AMORPHOUS SEMICONDUCTORS", Appl. Phys. lett., Vol. 18<br>
(1971), pp. 254-257, U.S. Patent 3,530,441).<br>
Used practically at present as a means for recording<br>
on an information recording medium employing a rewritable<br>
phase-change recording material, is to utilize a<br>
reversible change between the crystalline phase and the<br>
amorphous phase to let the crystalline state in a non-<br>
recorded/erased state and to form amorphous marks at the<br>
time of recording. Usually, the recording layer is<br>
locally heated to a temperature higher than the melting<br>
point and then rapidly cooled to form amorphous marks,<br>
and the recording layer is heated at a temperature of<br>
approximately at most melting point and at least<br>
crystallization temperature, and slc-wly cooled so that<br>
the recording layer is kept at a temperature of at most<br>
the crystallization temperature for a certain retention<br>
time to carry out recrystallization. Namely, in general,<br>
a reversible change between the stable crystalline phase<br>
and the amorphous phase is utilized. The information is<br>
retrieved by detecting the difference in physical<br>
parameters such as refractive index, electric resistance,<br>
volume and change in density, between the crystalline<br><br>
state and the amorphous state.<br>
Particularly as the application of the information<br>
recording medium as an optical recording medium,<br>
recording/retrieving/erasing of the information is<br>
carried out by utilizing a change in the reflectivity<br>
accompanying the reversible change between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state caused locally<br>
by irradiation of a focused light beam. Such an optical<br>
information recording medium having a phase-change type<br>
and rewritable type phase-change type recording layer is<br>
being developed and used practically as a low cost large<br>
capacity recording medium excellent in portability,<br>
weather resistance, impact resistance, etc. For example,<br>
rewritable CD such as CD-RW has already been used widely<br>
and rewritable DVD such as DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM is<br>
being on sale.<br>
As a material for such a phase change type recording<br>
layer, a chalcogenide alloy is used in many cases. As<br>
such a chalcogenide alloy, a GeSbTe type, InSbTe type,<br>
GeSnTe type or AglnSbTe type alloy may, for example, be<br>
mentioned. Particularly, a GeTe-Sb2Te3 pseudo-binary<br>
alloy type material is widely used as a recording layer<br>
material for an optical recording medium, and in recent<br>
years, its application at a non-volatile memory utilizing<br>
a change in the electric resistance has been actively<br>
studied.<br>
However, in proportion to increase in the volume of<br><br>
information in recent years, an optical recording medium<br>
on which recording/retrieving of information at a higher<br>
speed is possible, has been desired. Further, high<br>
storage stability of recorded information i.e. that<br>
information recorded on an optical recording medium does<br>
not deteriorate and is stable even after long-term<br>
storage, is also one of important performances required<br>
for an information recording medium. Among the above<br>
information recording media, with respect to the<br>
rewritable information recording medium, in order to<br>
merely achieve rewriting at a high speed, in a case of<br>
utilizing the phase change between the amorphous state<br>
and the crystalline state for example, a material having<br>
a high crystallization speed is sufficient. However,<br>
with a material with which a high speed crystallization<br>
is possible, the tendency for the amorphous state to be<br>
crystallized in a short time during storage will be<br>
remarkable. Accordingly, in order to obtain a rewritable<br>
information recording medium with which<br>
recording/retrieving at a high speed is possible, and<br>
which has a high storage stability of recorded<br>
information, transition from the amorphous state to the<br>
crystalline state at a high speed by high-speed<br>
crystallization is required at the time of erasing, on<br>
the contrary, stabilization of the amorphous state by an<br>
extremely slow crystallization is required in a storage<br>
state in the vicinity of room temperature. That is,<br><br>
seemingly conflicting properties are required for the<br>
phase-change recording material.<br>
Further, signal properties being stable after<br>
rewriting of information is carried out many times, i.e.<br>
high repetitive overwriting properties are also one of<br>
important performances required for a rewritable<br>
information recording medium.<br>
Further, in a case where the rewritable information<br>
recording medium is used as an optical recording medium<br>
on which recording/retrieving of information is carried<br>
out optically, it tends to be difficult to carry out<br>
initial crystallization of the recording layer after<br>
production in a short time. However, in view of<br>
increasing the production efficiency, carrying out the<br>
initial crystallization in a short time is also one of<br>
important performances required for an optical recording<br>
medium and therefore for a rewritable information<br>
recording medium.<br>
Under these circumstances, the present invention has<br>
been made to meet such demands, and it is an object of<br>
the present invention to provide a phase-change recording<br>
material capable of being used for an information<br>
recording medium on which recording/erasing at a higher<br>
speed is possible, which has a high storage stability of<br>
the recording signals, which is excellent in overwriting<br>
properties and which has a high productivity, and an<br>
information recording medium employing the above<br><br>
material. Further, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide an optical recording medium which is<br>
one form of the application of the information recording<br>
medium.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an<br>
optical information recording medium utilizing a<br>
crystalline state as a non-recorded state and an amorphous<br>
state as a recorded state, which employs a phase-change<br>
recording layer comprising an alloy having the composition<br>
of the following formula (1) as the main component:<br><br>
wherein each of x, y, z and w represents atomicity, x, z<br>
and w are numbers which satisfy <br>
and  respectively, and the element Ml is at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
In, Ga, Pt, Pd, Ag, rare earth elements, Se, N, 0, C, Zn,<br>
Si, Al, Bi, Ta, W, Nb and V, and<br>
(I)	when z=0 and w=0, y is a number which satisfies <br><br>
(II)	when and w=0, y is a number which satisfies<br>
  and<br>
(III)	when  and  y is a number which<br>
satisfies  and on atleast one side of the<br>
recording layer, a heat resistant protective layer is<br>
formed, on a substrate.<br><br>

Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.<br>
By use of a reconrding layer comprising an alloy<br>
having the above composition comprising Ge added to a Sb-<br>
Sn type alloy, as the main component, an information<br>
recording medium having a higher phase-change speed than<br>
that of a conventionally known information recording<br>
medium can be obtained, and accordingly recording/erasing<br>
at a higher speed can be carried out. For example, for<br>
an optical recording medium among information recording<br>
media, a phase-change recording material having a<br>
composition such as GeSbTe has conventionally been<br>
employed, however, with a composition which provides an<br>
adequately high crystallization speed to such an extent<br>
that erasing at a high, speed is possible, crystallization<br>
may not take place uniformly and the noise tends to be<br>
significant, such being problematic. On the other hand,<br><br>
with the phase-change recording material of SbSnGe type<br>
used in the present invention, the crystallization speed<br>
is high and uniform crystallization becomes possible, and<br>
accordingly it can be preferably used for high-speed<br>
recording. Further, with a conventional optical<br>
recording medium, it tends to be difficult to achieve<br>
both high crystallization speed and storage stability of<br>
recorded signals, however, with the information recording<br>
medium employing the phase-change recording material of<br>
the present invention, it becomes possible to achieve<br>
both the above performances.<br>
1. Phase-change recording material<br>
The phase-change recording material used in the<br>
present invention is a phase-change recording material<br>
used for an information recording medium utilizing a<br>
crystalline state as a non-recorded state and an<br>
amorphous state as a recorded state, and has the<br>
composition of the following formula (1) as the main<br>
component:<br>
(Sb1-xSnx)1-y-w-zGeyTewM1z	formula (1)<br>
wherein each of x, y, z and w represents atomicity, x, z<br>
and w are numbers which satisfy 0.01≤x≤0.5, 0≤z≤0.3<br>
and 0≤w≤0.1, and the element Ml is at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of In, Ga, Pt, Pd, Ag,<br>
rare earth elements, Se, N, 0, C, Zn, Si, Al, Bi, Ta, W,<br>
Nb and V, and<br>
when (I) z=0 and w=0, y is a number which satisfies 0.1≤<br><br><br>
when (II)  and w=0, y is a number which satisfies<br>
  and<br>
when (III)  and  y is a number which<br>
satisfies <br>
In the present specification, "having a<br>
predetermined composition as the main component" means<br>
that the content of the predetermined composition is at<br>
least 50 atomic% in the entire material or in the entire<br>
layer containing the predetermined composition.<br>
Further, when the information recording medium used<br>
in the present invention is an optical recording medium,<br>
"utilizing a crystalline state as a non-recorded state<br>
and an amorphous state as a recorded state" means that an<br>
amorphous mark is formed in the crystalline phase.<br>
In the present invention, Ge is incorporated into<br>
the Sb-Sn type alloy. Ge has a role to control the<br>
crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material, and accordingly by controlling the content of<br>
Ge in a predetermined range (10 atomic% to 30 atomic%), a<br>
phase-change recording material having a crystallization<br>
speed suitable for high speed recording can be obtained.<br>
Further, in the present invention, by incorporating<br>
Te into the Sb-Sn-Ge alloy as the case requires, a phase-<br>
change recording material more excellent in recording<br>
properties can be obtained. Specifically, by<br>
incorporating Ge, favorable recording properties can be<br><br>
obtained even in a case where repetitive recording is<br>
carried out on a phase-change material after long-term<br>
storage. Te also has a role to control the<br>
crystallization speed in the same manner as Ge, and<br>
accordingly when Ge and Te are incorporated into the Sb-<br>
Sn type alloy, the range of Ge content can be extended.<br>
Specifically, the lower limit of the Ge content can be<br>
decreased to 1 atomic%. Further, by decreasing the Ge<br>
content, recording properties after long-term storage of<br>
the phase-change recording material can be improved.<br>
In the present invention, by incorporating a<br>
predetermined element such as In into the Sb-Sn-Ge alloy<br>
or Sb-Sn-Ge-Te alloy, further effects such that the<br>
signal amplitude is increased, can be obtained. Further,<br>
by using the predetermined element such as In, it may be<br>
possible to further control the crystallization speed<br>
together with Ge and Te in some cases.<br>
Namely, in the present invention, by incorporating<br>
Ge into the Sb-Sn type alloy, a phase-change recording<br>
material excellent in high speed recording and storage<br>
stability of recording signals can be obtained, by<br>
favorably controlling the crystallization speed.<br>
Further, by incorporating another element such as Te<br>
and/or In into the Sb-Sn-Ge alloy, further effects such<br>
that favorable recording properties can be obtained even<br>
in the case where a repetitive recording is carried out<br>
on the phase-change recording material after long-term<br><br>
storage, and that the signal amplitude can be increased,<br>
can be obtained. Further, depending upon the element to<br>
be incorporated into the Sb-Sn-Ge alloy, the<br>
crystallization speed may be controlled more precisely,<br>
and further, recording performance such as recording<br>
properties after long-term storage will be favorable.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, a phase-change<br>
recording material having desired performances required<br>
for the application of use can be obtained.<br>
Further, in the present invention, by employing the<br>
phase-change recording material having the composition of<br>
the above formula (1) as the main component, for an<br>
information recording medium utilizing a crystalline<br>
state as a non-recorded state and an amorphous state as a<br>
recorded state, quality of recording signals remarkably<br>
improves. Particularly by the use of the above phase-<br>
change recording material for a rewritable information<br>
recording medium, high speed recording/erasing,<br>
improvement in storage stability of recording signals,<br>
improvement in overwriting properties, and improvement in<br>
overwriting properties in a case where overwriting is<br>
further carried out on the rewritable information<br>
recording medium after long-term storage, will be<br>
achieved. Further, a rewritable information recording<br>
medium of which the initial crystallization is easy and<br>
which has a high productivity can be obtained. As the<br>
rewritable information recording medium, an optical<br><br>
recording medium (such as CD-RW) may, for example, be<br>
mentioned, on which recording/retrieving/erasing of<br>
information is carried out by utilizing a change in the<br>
reflectivity due to a reversible change between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state by irradiation<br>
of a focused light beam.<br>
Now, the phase-change recording material will be<br>
explained with reference to the items (A) when z=0 and<br>
w=0, (B) when and w=0, (C) when  and <br>
  in the above formula (1), and (D) other items.<br>
(A) When z=0 and w=0<br>
When z=0 and w=0 in the above formula (1), the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention<br>
is a SbSnGe ternary composition, and the above formula<br>
(1) has the following formula (1a):<br><br>
wherein x and y are numbers which satisfy <br>
and respectively.<br>
In the formula (la), when x is at least 0.01, the<br>
crystalline state tends to be uniform, and the noise at<br>
the time of retrieving can be decreased, such being<br>
advantageous. Here, the uniform crystalline state means<br>
a poly-crystalline structure substantially comprising<br>
single crystalline phase and comprising fine<br>
crystallites. Fine crystallites mean that the average<br>
crystalline grain size is the same or lower order as the<br>
size of the recording marks, and the dispersion of the<br><br>
grain size is small.<br>
In the formula (1a), x is preferably more<br>
preferably  furthermore preferably   and<br>
particularly preferably . When x is within this<br>
range, more uniform crystalline state can be obtained,<br>
and the noise at the time of retrieving can be further<br>
decreased.<br>
On the contrary, in the above formula (la), when x<br>
is smaller than 0.01 (Sn is smaller than 1 atomic%), no<br>
uniform crystalline state in the entire phase-change<br>
recording material can be obtained. This means that a<br>
uniform initial crystalline state (non-recorded state) as<br>
a presupposition to form high quality amorphous recording<br>
marks, can not be obtained. That is, that no uniform<br>
crystalline state in the entire phase-change recording<br>
material can be obtained, means the it tends to be<br>
difficult to let the crystalline state in a non-recorded<br>
state and the amorphous state in a recorded state.<br>
Further, when x is large, the difference in optical<br>
properties between the crystalline state and the<br>
amorphous state tends to be significant, and accordingly<br>
a high signal amplitude can be obtained when the<br>
information recording medium of the present invention is<br>
used as an optical recording medium. However, when x is<br>
larger than 0.5, it tends to be difficult to stably carry<br>
out formation of amorphous marks (recording) and<br>
crystallization of the amorphous marks (erased/non-<br><br>
recorded state), and accordingly x is at most 0.5.<br>
Further, in a case where a reversible phase change<br>
between the crystalline state and the amorphous state is<br>
repeatedly carried out, in order to carry out the<br>
reversible phase change (rewriting of information) at<br>
least 100 times more securely, preferably <br>
particularly preferably  It is considered that<br>
the value of x is more preferably within the above range<br>
because when Sn is excessively incorporated, no phase<br>
change of the phase-change recording material by the<br>
change of crystallization/amorphous mechanism considered<br>
to be due to phase separation of Sn will not take place.<br>
Particularly, when x is small within a range of x of<br>
at least 0.2 and at most 0.35, although the signal<br>
amplitude tends to be low, the durability of the phase-<br>
change recording material tends to improve when<br>
repetitive recordings is carried out, such being<br>
preferred.<br>
Accordingly, of the phase-change recording material<br>
used in the present invention, by controlling the value<br>
of x, the above properties can flexibly be realized, and<br>
accordingly an appropriate composition depending upon the<br>
purpose of use of an information recording medium for<br>
which the phase-change recording material is used can be<br>
used.<br>
On the other hand, by changing the Ge Content in the<br>
above formula (la), the crystallization speed can be<br><br>
controlled. Namely, when y is small, in the recording<br>
layer composition (Sb1-xSnx) 1-yGey, the crystallization<br>
speed tends to be high. With respect to the rewritable<br>
information recording medium, takings recording/erasing in<br>
a short time into consideration, the crystallization<br>
speed is preferably high. Accordingly, in order to<br>
obtain an appropriate crystallization speed depending<br>
upon the recording conditions of the rewritable<br>
information recording medium, the Ge content to be<br>
incorporated should be optionally controlled.<br>
Specifically, taking e.g. a case of using the rewritable<br>
information recording medium as an optical recording<br>
medium into consideration, the range of y is at least<br>
0.1, preferably at least 0.12, more preferably at least<br>
0.15, and on the other hand, at most 0.3, preferably at<br>
most 0.25, more preferably at most 0.2, as the scanning<br>
linear velocity adjustment mechanism of the focused light<br>
beam, the laser power rise time, etc. are restricted.<br>
As described above, when the Ge content is low (y is<br>
decreased), the crystallization speed increases. For the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention,<br>
a crystallization speed to a certain extent is required.<br>
However, if the crystallization speed is too high, the<br>
phase-change recording material once melted in the<br>
process of amorphous state formation may be<br>
recrystallized, at the time of its re-solidification, and<br>
no amorphous state tends to be obtained. Further,<br><br>
storage stability of the obtained amorphous state tends<br>
to decrease. Accordingly, in order to let the<br>
crystalline state in a non-recorded state and the<br>
amorphous state in a recorded state, it is necessary that<br>
y is at least 0.1 (Ge is incorporated in an amount of at<br>
least 10 atomic%).<br>
Further, in the phase-change recording material used<br>
in the present invention, Ge is considered to be relevant<br>
to the stability of the amorphous marks. Namely, it is<br>
considered that when the Ge content is increased,<br>
stability of the amorphous marks tends to improve.<br>
However, if y is larger than 0.3, the amorphous marks<br>
tend to be too stable, and recrystallization (erasing) in<br>
a short time and initial crystallization tend to be<br>
difficult. In the above formula (1a), when the Ge<br>
content is within a range of from at least 10 atomic% and<br>
at most 30 atomic%, the amorphous marks will be extremely<br>
stable while securing the required crystallization speed,<br>
and not only the crystalline state and the amorphous<br>
state can be utilized as a non-recorded state and a<br>
recorded state, respectively, but also storage stability<br>
of the recorded signals will be excellent.<br>
Of the phase-change recording material used in the<br>
present invention, the crystallization speed preferably<br>
changes significantly depending upon the temperature at<br>
the time of crystallization. Namely, it is preferred<br>
that the crystallization speed is high when the<br><br>
temperature at the time of crystallization is in a high<br>
temperature region in which the temperature is adequately<br>
higher than the crystallization temperature and is close<br>
to the melting point, and on the other hand, the<br>
crystallization speed is low in a low temperature region<br>
in the vicinity of room temperature. In the present<br>
invention, by using Ge, the above temperature dependency<br>
of the crystallization speed can be realized.<br>
(B) When and w=0<br>
When and w=0 in the above formula (1), the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention<br>
has a SbSnGeMl quaternary composition, and the above<br>
formula (1) has the following formula (lb):<br><br>
wherein x and y are numbers which satisfy <br>
and  respectively. In the above formula<br>
(lb), the element Ml is at least one member selected from<br>
the group consisting of In, Ga, Pt, Pd, Ag, rare earth<br>
elements, Se, N, O, C, Zn, Si, Al, Bi, Ta, W, Nb and V.<br>
In order to improve the overwriting properties when<br>
overwriting is carried out on the amorphous recording<br>
marks after long-term storage, the Sn content is<br>
preferably low, however, if the amount of Sn is small, no<br>
uniform crystalline state tends to be obtained, the noise<br>
tends to be significant, and the initial properties tend<br>
to somewhat deteriorate in some cases. In such a case,<br>
by incorporating the element Ml, the increase of the<br><br>
noise can be suppressed. That is, by using the element<br>
M1, the disc excellent in initial properties and having<br>
favorable overwriting properties when overwriting is<br>
carried out on the recording marks after long-term<br>
storage can be obtained.<br>
The reason why the value of x is within a range of<br>
  in the above formula (1b), is as explained<br>
in the above item (A) . Further, in the above formula<br>
(1b), when x is large, the difference in optical<br>
properties between the crystalline state and the<br>
amorphous state tends to be significant, and accordingly<br>
a high signal amplitude can be obtained when the<br>
information recording medium of the present invention is<br>
used particularly as an optical recording medium.<br>
However, in view of further improvement of the repetitive<br>
overwriting durability and the signal properties in the<br>
case where overwriting is further carried out on the<br>
amorphous recording marks after long-term storage, x is<br>
preferably at most 0.2. In the SbSnGe ternary<br>
composition as in the above formula (1a), in a case where<br>
x≤0.2, the noise of the medium tends to be significant<br>
when x is small, however, by addition of the element Ml,<br>
the noise can be decreased. Accordingly, a phase-change<br>
recording material which is more excellent in signal<br>
properties when overwriting is further carried out on the<br>
recording marks after long-term storage can be obtained.<br>
In the above formula (1b), as the element M1 is<br><br>
required to be incorporated, the value of z is higher<br>
than 0, but is preferably at least 0.005, more preferably<br>
at least 0.01. Within this range, the crystalline state<br>
will be more uniform in the entire phase-change recording<br>
material, and the noise will be reduced. Further, when z<br>
is within the above range, even when x≤0.2 in the above<br>
formula (1b), the noise can securely be reduced. On the<br>
other hand, the value of z is at most 0.3, preferably at<br>
most 0.25, more preferably at most 0.2. Within this<br>
range, the change in the reflectivity at the time of<br>
phase change between the crystallines state and the<br>
amorphous state will be adequately large, and further,<br>
the phase change speed can be increased.<br>
In the above formula (1b), the element M1 is at<br>
least an member selected from the group consisting of In,<br>
Ga, Pt, Pd, Ag, rare earth elements, Se, N, O, C, Zn, Si,<br>
Al, Bi, Ta, W, Nb and V. By using a small amount of such<br>
an element M1, recording properties after a lapse of long<br>
time can be improved, or other effects may further be<br>
obtained, substantially without changing the<br>
crystallization speed. Now, the effects of the element<br>
Ml will be explained with regard to (B-1) element<br>
selected from In, Ga, Pd, Pt and Ag, (B-2) rare earth<br>
elements and (B-3) element selected from Se, N, O, C, Zn,<br>
Si, Al, Bi, Ta, W, Nb and V.<br>
By use of the element Ml, control of the<br>
crystallization speed may be possible in some cases.<br><br>
Accordingly, by using the element M1, the lower limit of<br>
the Ge content can be decreased (the amount of Ge can be<br>
smaller than 10 atomic%) in the SbSnGeM1 quaternary<br>
composition of the above formula (lb) . This will be<br>
explained in the following item (B-4) . However, the<br>
adjustment of the crystallization speed by use of the<br>
element Ml is the secondary effect, and the adjustment of<br>
the crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material is carried out by control of the Ge content<br>
first.<br>
(B-1) Element selected from In, Ga, Pd, Pt and Ag<br>
When the element M1 is an element selected from In,<br>
Ga, Pd, Pt and Ag in the above formula (1b), although the<br>
initial crystallization tends to be somewhat difficult,<br>
an effect of increasing the stability of the amorphous<br>
marks may be obtained by increasing the crystallization<br>
temperature. Further, when the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention is used for a recording<br>
layer of an optical recording medium, the signal<br>
amplitude can be increased, such being advantageous.<br>
Here, the increase of the signal amplitude means an<br>
increase of the change in the refractive index between<br>
the crystalline states and the amorphous state.<br>
When the Sn content in the phases-change recording<br>
material is decreased, the signal amplitude tends to be<br>
low in some cases, and in such a case also, by use of the<br>
above element as the element Ml, the decrease of the<br><br>
signal amplitude can be compensated. When the Sn content<br>
is decreased, repetitive overwriting properties, etc. may<br>
be improved, and accordingly when at least one element<br>
selected from In, Ga, Pd, Pt and Ag is used as the<br>
element Ml, x is preferably at most 0.2, particularly<br>
preferably at most 0.15 in the above formula (1b).<br>
Particularly when the element M1 to be added is In<br>
or Ga, the overwriting properties when overwriting is<br>
carried out on the recording marks after long-term<br>
storage may be improved. When In is compared with Ga, In<br>
provides a higher effect of decreasing the noise. When<br>
the element Ml to be added is Pt or Pd, although the<br>
improvement of the signal amplitude tends to be small,<br>
initial crystallization can be carried out easily, such<br>
being advantageous.<br>
Among these elements, it is most preferred to use In<br>
when the phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention is used for the optical recording medium. When<br>
In is used, it is preferred to control the In and Sn<br>
contents. Specifically, x+z in the above formula (1b) is<br>
preferably at least 0.05, particularly preferably at<br>
least 0.1. Further, the above x+z is preferably at most<br>
0.3, particularly preferably at most 0.25.<br>
(B-2) Rare earth elements<br>
The element M1 may be a rare earth element in the<br>
above formula (1b). The rare earth elements are Group 3B<br>
element of the Periodic Table, and specifically, they<br><br>
include Sc, Y, lanthanoids and actinoids. Such Group 3B<br>
elements of the Periodic Table have similar properties,<br>
and accordingly any of the above elements may be used as<br>
the element Ml. Preferred is a series in which the 4f<br>
orbital is sequentially filled in view of the electron<br>
configuration, and it is preferred to use one or more<br>
lanthanoids (15 elements of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu,<br>
Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tin, Yb and Lu) which tend to have<br>
similar properties. Among the above lanthanoid,<br>
particularly preferred are Tb and Gd. By use of Tb or<br>
Gd, the initial crystallization of the information<br>
recording medium will be carried out easily.<br>
Further, when a lanthanoid is used as the element<br>
Ml, the following effect is also obtained. Of the phase-<br>
change recording material of SbSnGe type of the present<br>
invention, the crystallization speed tends to gradually<br>
decrease and the recording properties tend to deteriorate<br>
in some cases if repetitive overwriting recording is<br>
carried out, depending upon e.g. the recording<br>
conditions. For example, when the above phase-change<br>
recording material is used for a recording layer of a<br>
rewritable optical recording medium as one of information<br>
recording media, when the number of repetitive recording<br>
exceeds 1,000 times, the jitter properties tend to<br>
deteriorate in some cases. This tends to be remarkable<br>
when x is high within a range of Sn of 0.2≤x≤0.35.<br>
However, when x is increased (when the amount of Sn is<br><br>
increased), the signal amplitude tends to be high, and<br>
recording with a low power may be possible, such being<br>
advantageous. Accordingly, if the deterioration of the<br>
jitter properties due to repetitive recording can be<br>
reduced, it is effective to increase the value of x as<br>
far as possible (to increase the amount of Sn as far as<br>
possible) so as to increase the signal amplitude.<br>
Addition of a lanthanoid provides an effect of<br>
suppressing deterioration of the jitter properties<br>
accompanying the decrease of the crystallization speed<br>
when the above repetitive recording is carried out.<br>
Namely, by incorporating a lanthanoid into the SbSnGe<br>
type phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention, an information recording medium which has a<br>
high signal amplitude, on which recording is possible<br>
with a low power, and which is very excellent in<br>
repetitive recording durability will be obtained.<br>
The effect by incorporating a lanthanoid is<br>
remarkable particularly when the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention is used for an optical<br>
recording medium.<br>
(B-3) Element selected from Se, N, O, C, Zn, Si, Al, Bi,<br>
Ta, W, Nb and V<br>
When the element M1 is an element selected from Se,<br>
C, Si and Al in the above formula (1b), although the<br>
initial crystallization tends to be somewhat difficult,<br>
the signal amplitude can be increased, such being<br><br>
advantageous, and an effect of increasing the stability<br>
of the amorphous marks may also be obtained by increasing<br>
the crystallization temperature.<br>
Further, when the element M1 is an element selected<br>
from Bi, Ta, W, Nb and V, although improvement of the<br>
signal amplitude is small, the initial crystallization<br>
can easily be carried out, such being advantageous.<br>
Further, when the element Ml is an element selected<br>
from N, 0 and Zn, fine adjustment between the optical<br>
properties and the crystallization speed can be carried<br>
out.<br>
When the element Ml is at least one member selected<br>
from the group consisting of Se, N, O, C, Zn, Si, Al, Bi,<br>
Ta, W, Nb and V, the upper limit of the content of the<br>
element Ml is most preferably 10 atomic%. Namely, z in<br>
the above formula (lb) is preferably z≤0.1, more<br>
preferably z≤0.05. This is because if the above element<br>
is incorporated in an amount larger than 10 atomic%, the<br>
noise tends to be significant, or the initial<br>
crystallization tends to be difficult in some cases.<br>
(B-4) Secondary effect by use of the element M1<br>
By using the element Ml in the above formula (lb), y<br>
representing the amount of Ge can be decreased to be<br>
smaller than 0.1. As explained in the above item (A), in<br>
the ternary composition of SbSnGe, the Ge content can not<br>
be lower than 10 atomic% (y cannot be smaller than 0.1)<br>
in order that the crystallization speed is not too high,<br><br>
and in order to maintain formation stability and storage<br>
stability of the amorphous state recording marks.<br>
However, by addition of the element M1, the<br>
crystallization speed can be decreased so as to achieve<br>
favorable formation of the amorphous state and<br>
improvement of the storage stability in some cases. The<br>
effect is remarkable particularly when In, Ga, Ag or a<br>
lanthanoid (particularly Tb or Gd) is used. Accordingly,<br>
the lower limit of the Ge content can be decreased as<br>
compared with a case of the SbSnGe ternary composition.<br>
Decrease of the Ge content also provides the following<br>
effect.<br>
When Ge is incorporated in a large amount, the<br>
crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material tends to be low, and the storage stability of<br>
the amorphous phase tends to improve. Namely, by using<br>
Ge, recrystallization of the amorphous state in a storage<br>
state in the vicinity of room temperature can mainly be<br>
suppressed, thus improving the storage stability of the<br>
amorphous state. Accordingly, by using Ge, the recording<br>
stability of the phase-change recording material<br>
improves.<br>
However, such an improvement of the archival<br>
stability of the amorphous phase may cause such a problem<br>
in some cases that the phase change can not favorably be<br>
carried out when the amorphous phase after a lapse of<br>
long time is crystallized again (erasing of the recording<br><br>
marks). The reason why the above recrystallization of<br>
the amorphous phase can not favorably be carried out is<br>
not necessarily understood clearly, however, it is<br>
considered that the amorphous state once formed by rapid<br>
cooling transit to another more stable amorphous state<br>
with a lapse of time, and accordingly crystallization<br>
after long-term storage can not favorably be carried out.<br>
As the amorphous state once formed by rapid cooling is in<br>
a locally stable state, it is very likely that the state<br>
of atomic bond slightly changes in a long time, and the<br>
amorphous state transits to a state which is more stable<br>
in view of energy.<br>
Further, from such a viewpoint that emphasis is put<br>
on the recording properties when the amorphous marks are<br>
recrystallized (erased) after a lapse of long time and<br>
then the overwriting of amorphous marks is carried out<br>
again, it is preferred to achieve the effect of improving<br>
the erasing properties after a lapse of long time, even<br>
by making the storage stability of the amorphous phase in<br>
the vicinity of room temperature be somewhat unstable, by<br>
decreasing the Ge content as far as possible.<br>
However, as described above, in the SbSnGe type<br>
ternary composition, if the Ge content is lower than 10<br>
atomic%, the crystallization speed tends to be too high,<br>
whereby it tends to be difficult to let the crystalline<br>
state in a non-recorded state and the amorphous state in<br>
a recorded state. Further, even though the amorphous<br><br>
state is formed, the amorphous state tends to be<br>
recrystallized in storage at room temperature, and<br>
accordingly it is difficult to make the Ge content less<br>
than 10 atomic% in the SbSnGe type ternary composition.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, the effect of<br>
decreasing the crystallization speed or the effect of<br>
improving the storage stability of the amorphous state by<br>
the element Ml, and the effect of increasing the<br>
crystallization speed or the effect of decreasing the<br>
storage stability of the amorphous state by decreasing<br>
the Ge content, are counterbalanced with each other, and<br>
accordingly the recording properties after a lapse of<br>
long time will be improved substantially without changing<br>
the crystallization speed.<br>
However, the effect of decreasing the<br>
crystallization speed by the element Ml is not so high as<br>
the effect of decreasing the crystallization speed by Te,<br>
as mentioned hereinafter. Accordingly, when the element<br>
Ml is incorporated into the SbSnGe type ternary<br>
composition, the crystallization speed of the phase-<br>
change recording material tends to be too high, if the<br>
lower limit of the Ge content is lower than 5 atomic%<br>
(y=0.05). Accordingly, as described hereinafter,<br>
although the lower limit of the Ge content can be<br>
decreased to 1 atomic% (y=0.01) in a case where Te is<br>
incorporated into the SbSnGe type ternary composition,<br>
the lower limit of the Ge content can be decreased only<br><br>
to 5 atomic% (y=0.05) in a case where the element M1<br>
alone is incorporated into the SbSnGe type ternary<br>
composition.<br>
Namely, in the above formula (lb), the value of y is<br>
at least 0.05, preferably at least 0.08, more preferably<br>
at least 0.1, furthermore preferably at least 0.12,<br>
particularly preferably at least 0.15. Within this<br>
range, favorable recording properties will be obtained<br>
even after a lapse of long time. On the other hand, the<br>
value of y is at most 0.3, preferably at most 0.25, more<br>
preferably at most 0.2. Within this range,<br>
crystallization speed required at the time of high<br>
transfer rate recording/erasing can be obtained.<br><br>
In the above formula (1), when  and <br>
  the phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention has a composition containing Te. The formula<br>
(1) has the following formula (1c):<br><br>
wherein x and y are numbers which satisfy <br>
and respectively. Further, in the above<br>
formula (1c), the element M1 is at least one member<br>
selected from the group consisting of In, Ga, Pt, Pd, Ag,<br>
rare earth elements, Se, N, O, C, Zn, Si, Al, Bi, Ta, W,<br>
Nb and V.<br>
The reason why the value of x is within a range of<br>
  in the above formula (lc) is as explained in<br><br>
the above item (A) . In the SbSnGe ternary composition as<br>
in the above formula (la), when x is increased (such as x<br>
  the difference in optical properties between the<br>
crystalline state and the amorphous state tends to be<br>
significant, and accordingly a high signal amplitude can<br>
be obtained particularly when the information recording<br>
medium of the present invention is used as an optical<br>
recording medium. However, from a viewpoint to further<br>
improve repetitive overwriting durability and signal<br>
properties in a case where overwriting is further carried<br>
out on recording marks after long-term storage, it is<br>
preferred to decrease x to a certain extent. If Te is<br>
added, even in a case where x is at least 0.2 and is<br>
relatively high, the repetitive recording durability and<br>
signal properties when overwriting is further carried out<br>
on recording marks after long-term storage will improve.<br>
Accordingly, a phase-change recording material excellent<br>
in all of the initial properties, repetitive recording<br>
durability and signal properties in a case where<br>
overwriting is further carried out on recording marks<br>
after long-term storage, will be obtained.<br>
The Te content is higher than 0 atomic% (0<w and></w>
preferably at least 0.1 atomic%  , more<br>
preferably at least 1 atomic%  , particularly<br>
preferably at least 3 atomic%  . Within this<br>
range, overwriting properties will be favorable when<br>
overwriting is carried out on recording marks after long-<br><br>
term storage. On the other hand, if the Te content is<br>
high, a crystalline phase of GeTe or a crystalline phase<br>
of GeSbTe tends to appear, the uniformity of the<br>
crystalline structure in the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention containing SbSn as the<br>
main component tends to decrease, and the reflectivity of<br>
the crystalline state and the signal amplitude tend to be<br>
low. Accordingly, the Te content is at most 10 atomic%<br>
  preferably at most 9 atomic%  more<br>
preferably at most 7 atomic%  . When the Te<br>
content is at most 7 atomic%, the reflectivity of the<br>
crystalline state and the signal amplitude can adequately<br>
be secured.<br>
Now, the meaning of use of Te in the phase-change<br>
recording material of the present invention will be<br>
explained in further detail. That is, by using Te, the<br>
Ge content in the above formula (1c) can be decreased to<br>
be less than 10 atomic% (y
atomic% (y
a SbSnGe ternary composition, from such a viewpoint that<br>
the crystallization speed is adjusted to let the<br>
crystalline state in a non-recorded state and the<br>
amorphous state in a recorded state, y representing the<br>
Ge content can not be less than 0.1. Further, as<br>
explained in the above item (B), in the case of the a<br>
quaternary composition comprising Ml (such as In) having<br>
a role to adjust e.g. the crystallization speed added to<br><br>
SbSnGe, the lower limit of the Ge content can be<br>
decreased to 5 atomic% (y=0.05). However, in such a case<br>
also, when the Ge content is lower than 5 atomic%, the<br>
crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material tends to be too high.<br>
When Te is incorporated in the phase-change<br>
recording material having such a composition, the<br>
crystallization speed can further be decreased. As<br>
mentioned above, Ge is an element which has a powerful<br>
role to decrease the crystallization speed. Accordingly,<br>
the lower limit of the Ge content can be decreased as<br>
compared with the composition of SbSnGe or SbSnGeM1.<br>
Decreasing the Ge content also has the following effects.<br>
When Ge is incorporated in a large amount, the<br>
crystallization speed of the phase-change recording<br>
material tends to be low, whereby the storage stability<br>
of the amorphous state tends to improve. Namely, by use<br>
of Ge, recrystallization of the amorphous state stored<br>
mainly in the vicinity of room temperature can be<br>
suppressed, and the storage stability of the amorphous<br>
state will improve. Accordingly, by using Ge, the<br>
recording stability of the phase-change recording<br>
material will improve.<br>
However, this improvement of the storage stability<br>
of the amorphous state may cause such a problem that the<br>
phase change can not. favorably be carried out when the<br>
amorphous state after a lapse of long time after<br><br>
recording, is crystallized again (erasing of recording<br>
marks) in some cases. The reason why the amorphous state<br>
can not favorably be crystallized again is not<br>
necessarily understood clearly, however, it is considered<br>
that the amorphous state once formed by rapid cooling<br>
transfers to another more stable amorphous state as time<br>
goes by.<br>
Accordingly, from such a viewpoint that emphasis is<br>
put on recording properties in such a case that the<br>
amorphous marks are once recrystallized (erased) after<br>
the lapse of long time and then the amorphous marks are<br>
recorded again, it is preferred to achieve the effect of<br>
improving the erasing properties after a lapse of long<br>
time, even by making the storage stability of the<br>
amorphous state in the vicinity of room temperature be<br>
somewhat unstable, by decreasing the Ge content as far as<br>
possible. However, as described above, when the Ge<br>
content is low, the crystallization speed tends to be too<br>
high, whereby it becomes difficult to let the crystalline<br>
state in a non-recorded state and the amorphous state in<br>
a recorded state. Further, even if the amorphous state<br>
is formed, the amorphous state is likely to be<br>
recrystallized in storage at room temperature.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, by use of Te, the<br>
effect of decreasing the crystallization speed or the<br>
effect of improving the storage stability of the<br>
amorphous state by Te, and the effect of increasing the<br><br>
crystallization speed or the effect of decreasing the<br>
storage stability of the amorphous state by decreasing<br>
the Ge content, are counterbalanced with each other, and<br>
accordingly the recording properties after a lapse of<br>
long time will be improved substantially without changing<br>
the crystallization speed.<br>
Further, it is estimated that by use of Te, such an<br>
effect that transfer of the amorphous state to another<br>
more stable amorphous state by the above-described change<br>
with time is suppressed, is also obtained.<br>
Taking the above into consideration, y representing<br>
the Ge content in the above formula (1c) is at least<br>
0.01, preferably at least 0.05, more preferably at least<br>
0.08, further more preferably at least 0.1. Within this<br>
range, favorable recording properties even after a lapse<br>
of long time will be obtained. On the other hand, the<br>
value of y is at most 0.3, preferably at most 0.25, more<br>
preferably at most 0.2. Within this range,<br>
crystallization speed required for recording/erasing at a<br>
high transfer rate will be obtained.<br>
One purpose of use of Te in combination with Ge for<br>
the phase-change recording material is further to<br>
increase long-term storage stability as compared with the<br>
case of Ge alone as described above. Accordingly, it is<br>
preferred that Te is used subsidiary to Ge. Further, the<br>
total content of Ge and Te is preferably y+w≤0.3, more<br>
preferably y+w≤0.2. On the other hand, in order to<br><br>
secure stability of the amorphous marks, y+w is usually<br>
at least 0.05, preferably at least 0.07, more preferably<br>
at least 0.1.<br>
Further, the meaning of use of the element Ml in the<br>
above formula (1c) is as explained in the above item (B)<br>
(by use of the element Ml, the increase of the noise will<br>
be suppressed, another effect may further be obtained<br>
depending upon the type of the element Ml used, etc.).<br>
Further, the range of z representing the content of the<br>
element M1 in the above formula (1c) and the reason why z<br>
is within such a range, etc. are also explained in the<br>
above item (B).<br>
The reflectivity in the crystalline state and the<br>
signal amplitude of the phase-change recording material<br>
tend to decrease by addition of Te, and accordingly when<br>
an element which has a role to increase the signal<br>
amplitude such as In, Pd, Ag or Au is added as the<br>
element M1 simultaneously with addition of Te, a more<br>
favorable phase-change recording material will be<br>
obtained. Most preferred as the element M1 to be used in<br>
combination with Te is In. In this case, the formula (1)<br>
has the following formula (Id):<br>
(Sb1-xSnx)1-y-w-zGeyTewIn2 (1d)<br>
Particularly, in order to suppress the decrease in the<br>
optical contrast due to addition of Te, the amount of In<br>
or Sn should be large, and the ratio of the total content<br>
of In and Sn {xx(1-y-w-z)+z} to the Te content w, i.e.<br><br>
{xx(1-y-w-z)+z}/w is at least 2, more preferably at least<br>
3.<br>
(D) Other items<br>
The phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention preferably contains Sb as the main component.<br>
As the element most effective for high-speed<br>
crystallization is Sb, favorable recrystallization can be<br>
carried out even in a case where recrystallization of<br>
amorphous marks (erasing) is carried out by irradiation<br>
of an energy beam in a time shorter than 100 nsec, for<br>
example, when a phase-change recording material<br>
containing Sb as the main component is used.<br>
Accordingly, in the above formula (1), the Sb content is<br>
preferably at least 50 atomic%. Namely, it is preferred<br>
that (1-x) x (1-y-w-z) ≤ 0 . 5 . By using Sb as the main<br>
component, a single crystalline phcise comprising a Sb<br>
hexagonal structure as the base will easily be obtained.<br>
Further, in the above formula (1), in order to<br>
precisely control the crystallization speed, it is<br>
important to control the total content of Ge, Te and the<br>
element M1. Accordingly, y+z+w is preferably at least<br>
0.1, more preferably at least 0.15. Within such a range,<br>
amorphous marks will favorably be formed. On the other<br>
hand, y+z+w is preferably at most 0.4, more preferably at<br>
most 0.3. Within such a range, the phase-change speed<br>
will be adequately high, and the change in the<br>
reflectivity at the time of phase change will be<br><br>
significant. Further, within the above range, appearance<br>
of another stable crystalline phase by combination of Ge,<br>
Te and the element Ml will be suppressed.<br>
The meaning of controlling the sum of y, z and w in<br>
the above formula (1) will be explained in detail below.<br>
In the above formula (1), by changing the Ge<br>
content, the crystallization speed can be controlled.<br>
Namely, in the recording composition (Sb1-xSnx)1-y-w-<br>
zGeyTewM1z, the crystallization speed tends to be high<br>
when y is small. It is necessary that the<br>
crystallization speed is high for recording/erasing in a<br>
short time on a rewritable information recording medium<br>
in general. Accordingly, in order to obtain<br>
crystallization speed depending upon the recording<br>
conditions of a rewritable information recording medium,<br>
the Ge content to be incorporated should be optionally<br>
controlled. However, the crystallization speed also<br>
relates to the values of z and w, and when z or w is<br>
high, the crystallization speed tends to be low.<br>
Accordingly, in order to control the crystallization<br>
speed, it is effective to control y+z+w to be within the<br>
above predetermined range by decreasing y when z or w is<br>
high.<br>
JP-A-63-201927 discloses recording elements of a<br>
write once type, comprising a SbSnGe type alloy.<br>
However, the principle of forming the recording marks is<br>
different from that of the present invention. Namely, in<br><br>
the write once type medium as disclosed in JP-A-63-<br>
201927, an amorphous film obtained at the time of<br>
preparation of the medium is utilized as a non-recorded<br>
state, and crystalline recording marks are formed therein<br>
by light irradiation. On the other hand, in the phase-<br>
change recording material of the present invention, the<br>
crystalline state of the phase-change recording material<br>
is in a non-recorded state, and the amorphous state is in<br>
a recorded state. Particularly when the phase-change<br>
recording material of the present invention is used for<br>
an optical recording medium, it is important that the<br>
entire recording layer containing the phase-change<br>
recording material is in a uniform crystalline state. In<br>
the optical recording medium, amorphous recording marks<br>
are formed in the above recording layer in the uniform<br>
crystalline state.<br>
Here, the performances required for the phase-change<br>
recording material are significantly different between<br>
the case where crystalline recording marks are formed on<br>
a write once type medium and the case where the amorphous<br>
recording marks are formed as in the medium of the<br>
present invention.<br>
First, the range of the crystallization speed<br>
required for the phase-change recording material is<br>
different as between the case where crystalline recording<br>
marks are formed on a write once type medium and the case<br>
where amorphous recording marks are formed as in the<br><br>
medium of the present invention. Namely, in a case where<br>
crystalline recording marks are formed on a write once<br>
type medium, it is required to use a phase-change<br>
recording material having a very high crystallization<br>
speed, because not only once formed crystalline recording<br>
marks are not required to be recovered to the amorphous<br>
state, but also it is unfavorable that the recording<br>
marks recover to the amorphous state from the viewpoint<br>
of securing the stability of the crystalline marks.<br>
Further, in a phase-change recording material having a<br>
low crystallization speed, before the entire area which<br>
is melted by e.g. light irradiation becomes in a<br>
crystalline state, part of the area becomes in an<br>
amorphous state, and thus the recording marks may deform,<br>
such being problematic.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the amorphous<br>
recording marks are formed as in the medium of the<br>
present invention, if the crystallization speed of the<br>
phase-change recording material is too high, the area<br>
which is melted by e.g. light irradiation is<br>
recrystallized, and the amorphous recording marks can not<br>
be formed. Accordingly, in order to stably form the<br>
amorphous recording marks, it is required to achieve the<br>
crystallization speed with the crystallization speed and<br>
the stability of the amorphous recording marks are well<br>
balanced. Accordingly, in order to keep a favorable<br>
balance of the crystallization speed with the stability<br><br>
of the amorphous recording marks, the temperature<br>
dependency of the crystallization speed is preferably<br>
high. Namely, in a case where the amorphous recording<br>
marks are recrystallized, the temperature at the time of<br>
crystallization is in a high temperature region which is<br>
adequately higher than the crystallization temperature<br>
and is close to the melting point, and the<br>
crystallization speed is preferably high in this<br>
temperature region. On the other hand, from the<br>
viewpoint to increase the storage stability of the<br>
amorphous recording marks, in a low temperature region<br>
which is adequately lower than the crystallization<br>
temperature and is in the vicinity of the room<br>
temperature, the crystallization speed is preferably low<br>
in order to prevent recrystallization of amorphous marks.<br>
In the phase-change recording material of the present<br>
invention, by using Ge and further by controlling the Ge<br>
content, the above temperature dependency of the<br>
crystallization speed can be realized.<br>
Second, the required properties regarding<br>
crystalline nucleation in the phase-change recording<br>
material are also totally different as between the case<br>
of forming crystalline recording marks on a write once<br>
type medium and the case where amorphous recording marks<br>
are formed as in the medium of the present invention.<br>
Namely, in a case where crystalline recording marks are<br>
formed in the amorphous state, it is required that a<br><br>
large number of crystalline nuclei are present in the<br>
amorphous state. This is because the crystalline<br>
recording marks can not be formed in a region where no<br>
crystalline nuclei are present, and it is required that a<br>
large number of crystalline nuclei are present in the<br>
region on which recording marks are to be formed, in<br>
order to accurately control the shape and the position of<br>
the crystalline recording marks. If the number of the<br>
crystalline nuclei is insufficient, as the position of<br>
the crystalline recording mark formation depends on the<br>
position of the crystalline nuclei, recording properties<br>
such as jitters tend to deteriorate.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where amorphous<br>
recording marks are formed in a uniform crystalline state<br>
as in the medium of the present invention, it is<br>
preferred that no crystalline nuclei are present in the<br>
phase-change recording material, or even if they are<br>
present, the number of the crystalline nuclei is small to<br>
such an extent that the crystalline nuclei do not<br>
substantially function in the process of forming<br>
amorphous recording marks. This is because if the<br>
crystalline nuclei effectively function in the process of<br>
mark formation, a part of or the entire melted region on<br>
which the amorphous marks are to be formed, is<br>
recrystallized without being formed into an amorphous<br>
state. Namely, in a case where amorphous marks are<br>
formed, it is preferred that the shape of the marks is<br><br>
determined only by the heat history of the phase-change<br>
recording material without being affected by the number<br>
or the position of the crystalline nuclei as far as<br>
possible.<br>
Further, in the present invention, even if no<br>
crystalline nuclei are present in the recording marks<br>
when the amorphous recording marks are erased by<br>
recrystallization, crystalline growth takes place with<br>
crystals at the periphery of the recording marks as the<br>
starting point, and accordingly it is not required that<br>
the crystalline nuclei are present in the amorphous<br>
state. In the present invention, by using Ge and further<br>
by controlling the Ge content, formation of the<br>
crystalline nuclei in the phase-change recording material<br>
can effectively be suppressed. Formation of the<br>
crystalline nuclei proceeds in a temperature region lower<br>
than a temperature region in which the crystalline growth<br>
takes place in general. Accordingly, suppression of the<br>
crystalline nucleation is preferred also in view of<br>
storage stability of the amorphous marks in the vicinity<br>
of room temperature.<br>
As mentioned above, the properties required for the<br>
phase-change recording material (such as the optimum<br>
region of the crystallization speed) and the crystalline<br>
state of the phase-change recording material (such as<br>
whether it is in a crystalline state in which a large<br>
number of crystalline nuclei are present, or it is a<br><br>
uniform crystalline state with a small number of<br>
crystalline nuclei), are different as between the case<br>
where crystalline recording marks are formed in a write<br>
once type medium and the case where amorphous recording<br>
marks are formed as in the medium of the present<br>
invention. As a result, the composition ranges of the<br>
phase-change recording material on which crystal<br>
recording marks are formed and the phase-change recording<br>
material on which amorphous recording marks are formed,<br>
are different of course.<br>
JP-A-2002-11958 discloses a write once type optical<br>
recording medium comprising InSnSb and a slight amount of<br>
Ge incorporated thereinto. However, the optical<br>
recording medium is to form recording marks in a<br>
crystalline state on a recording layer in an amorphous<br>
state (crystal recording type), and accordingly formation<br>
of recording marks in an amorphous state and improvement<br>
of storage stability of the recording marks in an<br>
amorphous state are not considered at all. Further, the<br>
recording medium is an optical recording medium of a<br>
crystal recording type, the Ge content is less than 5<br>
atomic% in the recording layer composition as<br>
specifically disclosed.<br>
2. Information recording medium<br>
The information recording medium of the present<br>
invention is an information recording medium utilizing<br>
the crystalline state as a non-recorded state and the<br><br>
amorphous state as a recorded state, and is characterized<br>
by using the phase-change recording material having the<br>
composition of the above formula (1) as the main<br>
component. As explained in the above item "1. phase-<br>
change recording material", when the phase-change<br>
recording material having the composition of the above<br>
formula (1) as the main component is used for a<br>
rewritable information recording medium, the effect of<br>
improving the quality of the recording signals and the<br>
effect of improving the productivity of the information<br>
recording medium tend to be particularly remarkable.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, the information<br>
recording medium is preferably used as a rewritable<br>
information recording medium on which the information can<br>
be rewritten by a reversible change of the phase-change<br>
recording material having the composition of the above<br>
formula (1) as the main component between the crystalline<br>
state and the amorphous state.<br>
More preferably, the information recording medium of<br>
the present invention is an optical recording medium, and<br>
is an information recording medium having a phase-change<br>
type recording layer containing the phase-change<br>
recording material having the composition of the above<br>
formula (1) as the main component and at least one<br>
protective layer. More preferably, the optical recording<br>
medium is a rewritable information recording medium.<br>
Now, the specific constitution of the medium and the<br><br>
recording/retrieving method will be described in detail<br>
in the following items (A) to (C), in a case of applying<br>
the phase-change recording material to be used in the<br>
present invention to a rewritable optical recording<br>
medium (hereinafter "rewritable optical recording medium"<br>
will be referred to simply as "optical recording<br>
medium").<br>
(A) Layer structure<br>
As the optical recording medium, usually one having<br>
the multilayer structure as shown in Fig. 1(a) or Fig.<br>
1(b) is employed. Namely, as evident from Figs. 1(a) and<br>
1(b), it is preferred that the recording layer to be used<br>
for the optical recording medium of the present invention<br>
and on at least one side thereof, heat resistant<br>
protective layers are formed, on a substrate. A<br>
reflective layer is formed on the side opposite to the<br>
incidence of recording and retrieving light beam in many<br>
cases, but the reflective layer is not essential.<br>
Further, a translucent absorption film is optionally<br>
formed on the side of the incidence of light with a<br>
purpose of controlling the light absorption. Further,<br>
the protective layer which is preferably formed on at<br>
least one side of the recording layer, is made to have a<br>
multilayer structure with materials having different<br>
properties.<br>
Now, the recording layer will be explained below.<br>
As the material contained in the recording layer,<br><br>
the phase-change recording material of the above formula<br>
(1) is used as the main component. In order to<br>
effectively obtain the effect of the present invention,<br>
the phase-change recording material of the above formula<br>
(1) is contained in an amount of usually at least 50<br>
atomic%, preferably at least 80 atomic%, more preferably<br>
at least 90 atomic%, particularly preferably at least 95<br>
atomic%, in the entire recording layer. The higher the<br>
content, the more remarkable the effect of the present<br>
invention. However, the effect of the present invention<br>
such as high speed recording/erasing will securely be<br>
obtained even if another component such as O or N is<br>
incorporated at the time of recording layer formation, if<br>
its content is within a range of several atomic% to 20<br>
atomic%.<br>
The thickness of the recording layer is usually at<br>
least 1 nm, preferably at least 5 nm, particularly<br>
preferably at least 10 nm, whereby the contrast of the<br>
reflectivity between the crystalline state and the<br>
amorphous state will be sufficient, and the<br>
crystallization speed will be sufficient, whereby<br>
recording/erasing in a short time will be possible.<br>
Further, the reflectivity itself will be sufficient. On<br>
the other hand, the thickness of the recording layer is<br>
usually at most 30 nm, preferably at most 25 nm,<br>
particularly preferably at most 20 nm, whereby a<br>
sufficient optical contrast will be obtained, and no<br><br>
cracks are likely to form on the recording layer.<br>
Further, no significant deterioration of the recording<br>
sensitivity due to increase of the thermal capacity will<br>
take place. Further, within the above film thickness<br>
range, the volume change due to a phase change can<br>
appropriately be suppressed, whereby microscopic and<br>
irreversible deformation of the recording layer itself or<br>
the protective layer to be formed on or below it, which<br>
may cause noise, is less likely to be accumulated when<br>
overwriting is repeatedly carried out. Such an<br>
accumulation of the deformation tends to decrease the<br>
repetitive overwriting durability, and this tendency can<br>
be suppressed by making the thickness of the recording<br>
layer within the above range.<br>
The requirement against noise is more severe in a<br>
case where recording/retrieving is carried out by means<br>
of a focused light beam with LD (laser diode) having a<br>
wavelength of about 650 nm with an objective lens with a<br>
numerical aperture of from about 0.6 to about 0.65, such<br>
as a rewritable DVD, or in a case of a high density<br>
medium on which recording/retrieving is carried out by<br>
means of a focused light beam with a blue LD having a<br>
wavelength of about 400 nm with an objective lens with a<br>
numerical aperture of from about 0.7 to about 0.85.<br>
Accordingly, in such a case, a more preferred thickness<br>
of the recording layer is at most 25 nm.<br>
The above recording layer can be obtained by DC or<br><br>
RF sputtering of a predetermined alloy target in an inert<br>
gas, particularly in an Ar gas.<br>
Further, the density of the recording layer is<br>
usually at least 80%, preferably at least 90% of the bulk<br>
density. The bulk density p is usually an approximate<br>
value by the following formula (2), but it may actually<br>
be measured by preparing a mass of the alloy composition<br>
constituting the recording layer:<br>
ρ =∑mi ρ i(2)<br>
wherein mi is the molar concentration of each element i,<br>
and ρ i is the atomic mass of each element i.<br>
In a film formation method by sputtering, the<br>
density of the recording layer can be increased by<br>
increasing the high energy Ar amount to be irradiated on<br>
the recording layer, by e.g. decreasing the pressure of<br>
the sputtering gas (usually an inert gas such as Ar: the<br>
following explanation will be made with reference to the<br>
case of Ar as an example) at the time of film formation<br>
or by disposing a substrate in the vicinity of the front<br>
of the target. The high energy Ar is either part of Ar<br>
ions to be irradiated on the target for sputtering, being<br>
reflected and arriving at the substrate side, or Ar ions<br>
in the plasma being accelerated by the sheath voltage on<br>
the entire substrate surface arriving at the substrate is<br>
general.<br>
Such an irradiation effect of a high energy inert<br>
gas is called atomic peening effect, and in sputtering by<br><br>
an Ar gas commonly used, Ar is incorporated in the<br>
sputtering film by the atomic peening effect. The atomic<br>
peening effect may be estimated from the Ar amount in the<br>
film. Namely, the smaller Ar amount means a smaller<br>
effect of high energy Ar irradiation, and a less dense<br>
film is likely to form.<br>
On the other hand, when the Ar amount is large,<br>
irradiation of the high energy Ar tends to be intense,<br>
and the density of the film will be high, however, Ar<br>
incorporated in the film is likely to deposit as voids at<br>
the time of repetitive overwriting, whereby repetitive<br>
durability is likely to deteriorate. Accordingly, a<br>
charging is carried out under an appropriate pressure,<br>
usually in the order of from 10-2 to 10-1 Pa.<br>
Now, other components in the structure of the<br>
optical recording medium which is an preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be explained below.<br>
As the substrate used in the present invention, a<br>
resin such as polycarbonate, acryl or polyolefin, glass<br>
or a metal such as aluminum may be employed. Guide<br>
grooves having a depth of from about 20 to about 80 nm<br>
are usually formed on the substrate, and preferred is a.<br>
substrate made of a resin on which the guide grooves can<br>
be formed by molding. Further, in a case of a so-called<br>
incidence from the substrate side wherein the focused<br>
light beam for recording/erasing/retrieving is incident<br>
from the substrate side (Fig. 1(a)), the substrate is<br><br>
preferably transparent.<br>
In order to prevent evaporation/deformation of the<br>
recording layer due to the phase change and to control<br>
heat diffusion at that time, a protective layer is<br>
usually formed on one side or on both sides of the<br>
recording layer, preferably on both sides. The material<br>
of the protective layer is determined in consideration of<br>
refractive index, thermal conductivity, chemical<br>
stability, mechanical strength, adhesion properties and<br>
so on. Generally, a dielectric material such as an<br>
oxide, a sulfide, a carbide or a nitride of a metal or a<br>
semiconductor material having a high transparency and a<br>
high melting point, or a fluoride of Ca, Mg, Li or the<br>
like, may be used.<br>
In such a case, these oxide, sulfide, carbide,<br>
nitride and fluoride are not always necessary to have a<br>
stoichiometric composition. It is effective to control<br>
the composition to adjust the refractive index and so on,<br>
or to use a mixture of these materials. A mixture of<br>
dielectric materials is preferred taking the repetitive<br>
recording properties into consideration. More<br>
specifically, a mixture of a heat resistant compound such<br>
as an oxide, a nitride, a carbide or a fluoride with ZnS<br>
or a chalcogen compound such as a rare earth sulfide may<br>
be mentioned. For example, a mixture of heat resistant<br>
compounds containing ZnS as the main component, and a<br>
mixture of heat resistant compounds containing an<br><br>
oxysulfide of rare earth particularly Y2O2S as the main<br>
component, are mentioned as examples of preferred<br>
protective layer composition.<br>
As the material to form the protective layer,<br>
usually a dielectric material may be mentioned. The<br>
dielectric material may, for example, be an oxide of e.g.<br>
Sc, Y, Ce, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Zn, Al, Cr, In, Si,<br>
Ge, Sn, Sb or Te, a nitride of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb,<br>
Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Zn, B, Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Sb or Pb, a<br>
carbide of e.g. Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Zn, B,<br>
Al, Ga, In or Si, or a mixture thereof. Further, as the<br>
dielectric material, a sulfide, a selenide or a telluride<br>
of e.g. Zn, Y, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Bi, a<br>
fluoride of e.g. Mg or Ca, or a mixture thereof may be<br>
mentioned.<br>
Further, as specific examples of the dielectric<br>
material, ZnS-SiO2, SiN, SiO2, TiO2, CrN, TaS2 or Y2O2S<br>
may, for example, be mentioned. Among these materials,<br>
ZnS-SiO2 is widely used in view of a high film formation<br>
speed, a small film stress, a small volume change due to<br>
the change in temperature and an excellent weather<br>
resistance.<br>
Taking the repetitive recording properties into<br>
consideration, the film density of the protective layer<br>
is preferably at least 80% of the bulk state, in view of<br>
mechanical strength. When a mixture of dielectric<br>
materials is used, the theoretical density of the above<br><br>
formula (2) is employed as the bulk density.<br>
The thickness of the protective layer is usually<br>
from 1 nm to 500 nm in general. When the thickness is at<br>
least 1 nm, the effect of preventing the deformation of<br>
the substrate or the recording layer can be adequately<br>
obtained, and its role as a protective layer can<br>
adequately be performed. Further, when the thickness is<br>
at most 500 nm, while the role as the protective layer is<br>
adequately performed, e.g. the internal stress of the<br>
protective layer itself or the difference in elastic<br>
properties with the substrate tend to be remarkable, thus<br>
preventing generation of cracks.<br>
Particularly when a protective layer (hereinafter<br>
sometimes referred to as a lower protective layer) is<br>
formed between the optical-beam entrance substance and<br>
the recording layer, the lower protective layer is<br>
required to suppress deformation of the substance by<br>
heat, and accordingly its thickness is usually at least 1<br>
nm, preferably at least 5 nm, particularly preferably at<br>
least 10 nm, whereby accumulation of microscopic<br>
deformation of the substance during repetitive<br>
overwriting will be suppressed, whereby the increase of<br>
noise caused by scattering of the retrieving light will<br>
not be remarkable.<br>
On the other hand, the thickness of the lower<br>
protective layer is preferably at most 200 nm, more<br>
preferably at most 150 nm, furthermore preferably at most<br><br>
100 nm, in relation to the time required for film<br>
formation. When the thickness is within this range, the<br>
groove shape of the substrate as observed on the<br>
recording layer plane will not change. Namely, such a<br>
phenomenon is less likely to take place that the depth or<br>
width of the grooves are smaller than the shape attempted<br>
on the substrate surface.<br>
On the other hand, when a protective layer<br>
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as an upper protective<br>
layer) is formed on the side of the recording layer<br>
opposite to the optical-beam entrance side, the thickness<br>
of the upper protective layer is usually at least 1 nm,<br>
preferably at least 5 nm, particularly preferably at<br>
least 10 nm, in order to suppress deformation of the<br>
recording layer. Further, in order to prevent<br>
accumulation of microscopic plastic deformation in the<br>
inside of the upper protective layer generated due to the<br>
repetitive overwriting and to suppress the noise increase<br>
due to scattering of retrieving light, it is preferably<br>
at most 2 00 nm, more preferably at most 150 nm,<br>
furthermore preferably at most 100 nm, particularly<br>
preferably at most 50 nm.<br>
The thickness of each of the recording layer and the<br>
protective layer is selected so as to provide good laser<br>
light absorbing efficiency and to increase the amplitude<br>
of the recording signals, i.e. to increase the contrast<br>
between a recorded state and a non-recorded state in<br><br>
consideration of an interfering effect caused by a<br>
multilayer structure, in addition to restrictions from<br>
mechanical strength and reliability.<br>
On the optical recording medium, a reflective layer<br>
may further be formed. The position on which the<br>
reflective layer is formed usually depends on the<br>
direction of incidence of retrieving light, and it is<br>
formed on the side of the recording layer opposite to the<br>
incidence side. namely, in a case where a retrieving<br>
light is incident from the substrate side, the reflective<br>
layer is usually formed on the side of the recording<br>
layer opposite to the substrate, and in a case where<br>
retrieving light is incident from the recording layer<br>
side, the reflective layer is formed usually between the<br>
recording layer and the substrate (Figs. 1(a), (b)) .<br>
The material used for the reflective layer is<br>
preferably a substance having a high reflectivity, and<br>
particularly preferred is a metal such as Au, Ag or Al<br>
with which heat dissipation effect can be expected. Its<br>
heat dissipation property is determined by the film<br>
thickness and the thermal conductivity, and as the<br>
thermal conductivity is substantially in proportion to<br>
the specific volume resistance in the case of these<br>
metals, and accordingly the heat dissipation property can<br>
be represented by the sheet resistivity. The sheet<br>
resistivity is usually at least 0.05 Ω/□, preferably at<br>
least 0.1 Ω/□, and usually at most 0.6 Ω/□, preferably<br><br>
at most 0.5 Ω/□ .<br>
This is to secure a particularly high heat<br>
dissipation property, and it is required to suppress<br>
recrystallization to a certain extent in a case where the<br>
competition between amorphous state forming and<br>
recrystallization is significant in formation of the<br>
amorphous marks as in the recording layer to be used for<br>
the optical recording medium. A small amount of Ta, Ti,<br>
Cr, Mo, Mg, V, Nb, Zr, Si or the like may added to the<br>
above metal to control the thermal conductivity of the<br>
reflective layer itself or to improve corrosion<br>
resistance. The addition amount is usually at least 0.01<br>
atomic% and at most 2 0 atomic%. An aluminum alloy<br>
containing Ta and/or Ti in an amount of at most 15<br>
atomic%, particularly an alloy of AlαTa1-α (0≤ α ≤0.15)<br>
is excellent in corrosion resistance, and is a<br>
particularly preferred reflective layer material in view<br>
of improving the reliability of the optical recording<br>
medium.<br>
Further, a Ag alloy comprising Ag and at least one<br>
member selected from Mg, Ti, Au, Cu, Pd, Pt, Zn, Cr, Si,<br>
Ge and rare earth elements in an amount of at least 0.01<br>
atomic% and at most 10 atomic% added to Ag, also has high<br>
reflectivity and thermal conductivity and excellent heat<br>
resistance and is thereby preferred.<br>
Particularly when the thickness of the upper<br>
protective layer is at least 5 nm and at most 50 nm, the<br><br>
amount of the element to be added is preferably at most 2<br>
atomic% in order that the reflective layer has a high<br>
thermal conductivity.<br>
Particularly preferred as a material of the<br>
reflective layer is one containing Ag as the main<br>
component. The reason why it is preferred to employ Ag<br>
as the main component is as follows. Namely, when<br>
overwriting is carried out again on the recording marks<br>
after long-term storage, such a phenomenon may take place<br>
in some cases that the recrystallization speed of the<br>
phase-change recording layer is high only at the time of<br>
the first overwriting immediately after the storage.<br>
Although the reason of such a phenomenon is not clearly<br>
understood, by increase of the recrystallization speed of<br>
the recording layer immediately after the storage, the<br>
size of the amorphous marks formed by the first<br>
overwriting immediately after the storage is smaller than<br>
the desired size of the marks. Accordingly, when such a<br>
phenomenon takes place, recrystallization of the<br>
recording layer at the time of the first overwriting<br>
immediately after the storage can be suppressed, whereby<br>
a desired size of the amorphous marks can be maintained,<br>
by increasing the cooling rate of the recording layer by<br>
using Ag having a very high release property for the<br>
reflective layer.<br>
The thickness of the reflective layer is preferably<br>
at least 10 nm so that the incident light is completely<br><br>
reflected without transmitted light. Further, if it is<br>
too thick, no further heat dissipation effect will be<br>
obtained but the productivity will be poor, and cracks<br>
are likely to form, and accordingly it is usually at most<br>
500 nm.<br>
The preferred layer structure of the optical<br>
recording medium is such a structure that a first<br>
protective layer, a recording layer, a second protective<br>
layer and a reflective layer are formed in this order<br>
along the direction of incidence of retrieving light.<br>
Namely, in a case where retrieving light is incident from<br>
the substrate side, preferred is a layer structure of a<br>
substrate, a lower protective layer, a recording layer,<br>
an upper protective layer and a reflective layer, and in<br>
a case where retrieving light is incident from the<br>
recording layer side, preferred is a layer structure of a<br>
substrate, a reflective layer, a lower protective layer,<br>
a recording layer and an upper protective layer.<br>
Needless to say, each layer may consist of at least<br>
two layers, and an interlayer may be formed therebetween.<br>
For example, between the substrate and the protective<br>
layer in the case where the retrieving light is incident<br>
from the substrate side, or on the protective layer in<br>
the case where retrieving light is incident from the side<br>
opposite to the substrate side, an extremely thin<br>
translucent layer of a metal, a semiconductor or a<br>
dielectric material having absorption property or the<br><br>
like may be formed so as to control the amount of light<br>
energy incident on the recording layer.<br>
Each of the recording layer, the protective layer<br>
and the reflective layer if formed usually by e.g. a<br>
sputtering method.<br>
The film formation is carried out preferably by<br>
placing a target for recording layer, a target for<br>
protective layer or a target for reflective layer<br>
material as the case requires, in an in-line device<br>
located in the same vacuum chamber because the oxidation<br>
and contamination by adjacent layers can be prevented.<br>
Further, such a method is advantageous in productivity.<br>
On the outermost side of the optical recording<br>
medium, a protective coat comprising an ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin or a thermosetting resin is preferably<br>
formed so as to prevent a direct contact with air or to<br>
prevent scars due to contact with a foreign substance.<br>
The protective coat usually has a thickness of from 1 -urn<br>
to several hundireds urn. Further, a dielectric material<br>
protective layei: having a high hardness may further be<br>
formed, or a resin layer may further be formed thereon.<br>
(B) Method of initial crystallization of the optical<br>
recording medium<br>
The recording layer is formed usually by a physical<br>
deposition method in vacuum such as a sputtering method,<br>
and the recording layer is usually amorphous in a state<br>
immediately after film formation (in an as-deposited<br><br>
state), and accordingly this is crystallized to be in a<br>
non-recorded/erased state in the present invention. This<br>
operation is called initialization. As the initial<br>
crystallization operation, oven annealing in a solid<br>
phase at a temperature of at least the crystallization<br>
temperature (usually from 150 to 300°C) and at most the<br>
melting point, annealing by irradiation with light energy<br>
such as laser light or flash lamp light, or melt<br>
initialization may, for example, be mentioned. In the<br>
present invention, it is preferred to employ the melt<br>
initialization among the above initial crystallization<br>
operations, as a phase-change recording material with<br>
small formation of crystalline nuclei is employed.<br>
In the melt initialization, if the recrystallization<br>
speed is too slow, another crystalline phase may form as<br>
there is a sufficient time to achieve thermal<br>
equilibrium, and accordingly it is preferred to increase<br>
the cooling rate to a certain extent. Further, when it<br>
is kept in a melted state for a long time, the recording<br>
layer may flow, a thin film such as the protective layer<br>
may be peeled off by stress, or e.g. a resin substrate<br>
may deform, thus causing destruction of the medium.<br>
For example, the time for which the recording layer<br>
is kept at a temperature of at least the melting point is<br>
usually at most 10 us, preferably at most 1 us.<br>
Further, for the melt initialization, it is<br>
preferred to employ laser light, and it is particularly<br><br>
preferred to carry out the initial crystallization by<br>
using elliptical shape laser light having a minor axis<br>
substantially in. parallel with the scanning direction<br>
(hereinafter this initialization method will sometimes be<br>
referred to as "bulk erasing") . In such a case, the<br>
length of the major axis is usually from 10 to 1,000 µm,<br>
and the length of the minor axis is usually from 0.1 to 5<br>
µm.<br>
The lengths of the major axis and the minor axis of<br>
the beam are defined from the full width at half maximum<br>
when the light energy intensity distribution of the beam<br>
is measured. The beam shape also preferably has a minor<br>
axis length of at most 5 µm, more preferably at most 2<br>
µm, so that the local heating in a minor axis direction<br>
and rapid cooling are easily realized.<br>
As a laser light source, various ones such as a<br>
semiconductor laser or a gas laser may be used. The<br>
laser light power is usually from about 100 mW to 10 W.<br>
Another light source may be used so long as the power<br>
density and the beam shape at the same level are<br>
obtained. Specifically, a Xe lamp light may, for<br>
example, be mentioned.<br>
At the time of initialization by bulk erasing, when<br>
a disc recording medium is used for example,<br>
initialization of the entire surface can be carried out<br>
in such a manner that the minor axis direction of the<br>
elliptical beam is substantially agreed with the<br><br>
tangential direction of the disc, and scanning is carried<br>
out in the minor axis direction while rotating the disc,<br>
and at the same time, the beam is moved to the long axis<br>
(radius) direction every one cycle (one rotation). By<br>
doing this, a polycrystalline structure aligned in a<br>
specific direction relative to the focused light beam for<br>
recording/retrieving for scanning along the track in a<br>
periphery direction can be realized.<br>
It is preferred that the distance of movement in a<br>
radius direction per one rotation is shorter than the<br>
beam major axis for overlapping, and the same radius is<br>
irradiated with laser light beam several times. As a<br>
result, secure initialization is possible, and at the<br>
same time, the non-uniformity in the initialized state<br>
derived from the energy distribution (usually from 10 to<br>
20%) in a beam radius direction can be avoided. On the<br>
other hand, if the amount of movement is too small, the<br>
above unfavorable crystalline phase is likely to form,<br>
and accordingly the amount of movement in a radius<br>
direction is usually at least half the beam major axis.<br>
At least whether an optical recording medium to be<br>
used in the present invention can be obtained by the melt<br>
initialization, can be judged by whether the reflectivity<br>
R1 in a non-recorded state after the initialization and<br>
the reflectivity R2 in an erased state by<br>
recrystallization after overwriting is carried out on the<br>
amorphous marks by a practical focused light beam for<br><br>
recording with a diameter of about 1 urn, are<br>
substantially the same. R2 is the reflectivity at the<br>
erased part after 10 times overwriting.<br>
Accordingly, the optical recording medium to be used<br>
in the present invention preferably satisfies the<br>
following relational expression (3) where Rl is the<br>
reflectivity at a non-recorded part after the initial<br>
crystallization and R2 is the reflectivity at an erased<br>
part after 10 time overwriting:<br><br>
The reason why the reflectivity R2 at an erased part<br>
after 10 time overwriting is employed as a judgment index<br>
is that when overwriting is carried out for 10 times, the<br>
influence of the reflectivity in a crystalline state<br>
which may remain in a non-recorded state by only one<br>
recording can be eliminated, and the entire surface of<br>
the optical recording medium can be in a recrystallized<br>
state at least once by recording/erasing. On the other<br>
hand, if the number of overwriting considerably exceeds<br>
10 times, factors other than the change in the<br>
crystalline structure, such as microscopic deformation by<br>
repetitive overwriting or diffusion of another element<br>
from the protective layer, may cause the change in the<br>
reflectivity, and the judgment whether a desired<br>
crystalline state can be obtained or not tends to be<br>
difficult.<br>
In the above relational expression (3), ΔR is at<br><br>
most 10%, preferably at most 5%. When it is at most 5%,<br>
an optical recording medium which causes a lower signal<br>
noise can be obtained.<br>
For example, of the optical recording medium having<br>
an R1 at a level of 17%, R2 should be approximately<br>
within a range of from 16 to 18%. The scanning velocity<br>
of the energy beam for initialization is usually within a<br>
range of from about 3 to about 20 m/s.<br>
The above erased state may be obtained also by<br>
melting the recording layer by irradiating a write power<br>
in a direct current mode and re-solidifying it, not<br>
necessarily by modulating the focused laser light for<br>
recording in accordance with the practical method of<br>
generating the recording pulse.<br>
In order to obtain a desired initial crystalline<br>
state of the phase-change recording material to be used<br>
in the present invention, setting of the scanning<br>
velocity of the energy beam for initialization relative<br>
to the recording layer plane is particularly important.<br>
Basically, it is important that the crystalline state<br>
after the initial crystallization is similar to the<br>
crystalline state at the erased state after overwriting,<br>
and accordingly it is preferred that the scanning<br>
velocity of the energy beam for initialization is close<br>
to the relative scanning linear velocity of the focused<br>
light beam relative to the recording layer plane when<br>
overwriting is practically carried out by using the<br><br>
focused light beam. Specifically, scanning is carried<br>
out by the energy beam for initialization at a linear<br>
velocity of from about 20 to about 80% of the maximum<br>
linear velocity where recording by overwriting is<br>
possible on the optical recording medium.<br>
The maximum linear velocity for overwriting is that<br>
the erasing ratio is at least 20 dB when, for example, an<br>
erasing power Pe is irradiated in a direct current mode<br>
at the maximum linear velocity.<br>
The erasing ratio is defined as the difference<br>
between the carrier level of the signals for the<br>
amorphous marks recorded at the substantially same<br>
frequency and the carrier level after erasing by direct<br>
current irradiation of Pe. Measurement of the erasing<br>
ratio is carried out as follows for example. First,<br>
under the recording conditions where adequate signal<br>
properties (i.e. such properties that the reflectivity<br>
and the signal amplitude, and jitter and the like satisfy<br>
predetermined values) are obtained, a condition with a<br>
high frequency is selected among modulating signals to be<br>
recorded, and overwriting is carried out 10 times at the<br>
single frequency to form amorphous marks, and the carrier<br>
level (C.L. at recording) is measured. Then, direct<br>
current irradiation is carried out on the amorphous marks<br>
once while changing the erasing power Pe, and the carrier<br>
level at that time (C.L. after erasing) is measured, and<br>
the difference between C.L. at recording and C.L. after<br><br>
erasing, i.e. the erasing ratio is calculated. When the<br>
power Pe of the direct current irradiation is changed,<br>
the erasing ratio tends to once increase, decrease and<br>
increase again in general. Here, the first peak value of<br>
the erasing ratio as observed when the power Pe is<br>
started to increase, is taken as the erasing power of the<br>
sample.<br>
If the scanning velocity of the energy beam for<br>
initialization is lower than the velocity of<br>
approximately 20% of the above-defined maximum linear<br>
velocity, phase separation may take place, whereby no<br>
single phase is likely to be obtained, or even if a<br>
single phase is obtained, the crystallites tend to extend<br>
particularly in the scanning direction of the beam for<br>
initialization and to grow to an enormous size, or tend<br>
to align in an unfavorable direction. Preferably,<br>
scanning of the energy beam for initialization is carried<br>
out at a velocity of at least 30% of the maximum linear<br>
velocity with which overwriting is possible.<br>
On the other hand, if scanning of the energy beam<br>
for initialization is carried out at a velocity equal to<br>
the maximum linear velocity with which recording by<br>
overwriting is possible, or at a velocity higher than<br>
approximately 80% of the maximum linear velocity, the<br>
region once melted by the scanning for initialization is<br>
formed into amorphous again, such being unfavorable.<br>
This is because the cooling rate of the melted portion<br><br>
becomes high when the scanning linear velocity is high,<br>
and the time required for re-solidification becomes<br>
short. Recrystallization by the crystal growth from the<br>
crystal region around the periphery of the melted region<br>
will be completed in a short time with focused light beam<br>
for recording having a diameter of about 1 µm. However,<br>
when scanning is carried out with elliptical light beam<br>
for initialization, the area of the melted region in a<br>
major axis direction becomes large, and accordingly it is<br>
required to decrease the scanning linear velocity as<br>
compared with practical overwriting, so that the<br>
recrystallization at the time of re-solidification is<br>
carried out in the entire melted region. From such a<br>
viewpoint, the scanning linear velocity of the energy<br>
beam for initialization is preferably at most 70% of the<br>
maximum linear velocity for overwriting, more preferably<br>
at most 60%.<br>
The optical recording medium to be used in the<br>
present invention has such a characteristic that when it<br>
is subjected to initial crystallization by irradiation<br>
with laser light, the rate of movement of the medium<br>
relative to the laser light can be increased. This leads<br>
to possibility of the initial crystallization in a short<br>
time, which improves productivity and makes cost cutting<br>
possible.<br>
(C) Method of recording/retrieving of the optical<br>
recording medium<br><br>
The recording and retrieving light to be used for<br>
the optical recording medium used in the present<br>
invention is usually laser light of e.g. a semiconductor<br>
laser or a gas laser, and its wavelength is usually from<br>
300 to 800 nm, preferably from about 350 to about 800 nm.<br>
Particularly, in order to achieve a high surface<br>
recording density of at least 1 Gbit/inch2, the focused<br>
light beam diameter is required to be small, and it is<br>
preferred to obtain a focused light beam by using blue to<br>
red laser light having a wavelength of from 350 to 680 nm<br>
and an objective lens having a numerical aperture NA of<br>
at least 0.5.<br>
In the present invention, as mentioned above, the<br>
amorphous state is utilized as the recording marks.<br>
Further, in the present invention, it is effective to<br>
record information by a mark length modulation method.<br>
This is particularly remarkable for mark length recording<br>
with a shortest mark length of at most 4 urn, particularly<br>
at most 1 µm.<br>
When recording marks are formed, recording by means<br>
of a conventional two power level modulation method may<br>
be carried out, however, in the present invention, it is<br>
particularly preferred to employ a recording method by a<br>
multiple power level modulation method of at least three<br>
values wherein an off-pulse period is provided when the<br>
recording marks are formed as shown below.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view illustrating a power<br><br>
pattern of a recording light in a method of recording on<br>
the optical recording medium. In forming amorphous mark,<br>
the mark length of which is modulated to a length nT (T<br>
is a reference clock period, n is a mark length which the<br>
mark may have by mark length modulation recording and is<br>
an integer), (n-j)T (wherein j is a real number of at<br>
least 0 and at most 2) is divided into recording pulses<br>
in a number of m=n-k (wherein k is an integer of at least<br>
0) , and the recording pulse width of each pulse is αiT<br>
  and each recording pulse is accompanied by an<br>
off-pulse section for a time of  . In Fig. 2<br>
which indicates a divided recording pulse, indication of<br>
the reference clock period T is omitted in view of<br>
viewability of the figure. Namely, in Fig. 2, the<br>
portion which should be described as a iT is simply<br>
described as αi. Here, it is preferred that  or α<br>
   is usually n, but it<br>
is possible that  (j is a constant which<br>
satisfies ) in order to obtain accurate nT marks.<br>
At the time of recording, a recording light with an<br>
erasing power Pe which may recrystallize the amorphous<br>
state is irradiated between marks. Further, recording<br>
light with a write power Pw which is sufficient to melt<br>
the recording layer is irradiated in a time of <br>
  and a recording light with a bias power Pb of<br>
Pb<pe preferably pe is irradiated in a time of></pe><br><br>
The power Pb of the recording light to be irradiated<br>
in a time of a period βmT is usually Pb<pe preferably></pe>
  in the same manner as the period of <br>
  , however, it is possible that <br>
By employing the above recording method, the power<br>
margin or the linear velocity margin at the time of<br>
recording can be increased. This effect is particularly<br>
remarkable when the bias power Pb is adequately low so<br>
that <br>
The above recording method is a method particularly<br>
suitable for an optical recording medium employing the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention<br>
for the recording layer. When the Ge amount is decreased<br>
to secure erasing in a short time, the critical cooling<br>
rate required for forming of amorphous marks will be<br>
extremely high, and formation of favorable amorphous<br>
marks tends to be difficult.<br>
Namely, this is because decrease of the Ge amount<br>
accelerates recrystallization from the crystallized part<br>
around the periphery of the amorphous marks, and at the<br>
same time, increases the crystal growth rate at the time<br>
of melting and re-solidification also. If the<br>
recrystallization rate from around the periphery of the<br>
amorphous marks is increased to a certain extent,<br>
recrystallization from around the periphery of the melted<br>
region tends to proceed at the time of re-solidification<br>
of the melted region formed for recording of amorphous<br><br>
marks, and the melted region tends to be recrystallized<br>
without being formed into an amorphous state, unless the<br>
cooling rate is extremely high.<br>
In addition, the clock period is shortened, and the<br>
off-pulse section becomes short, whereby the cooling<br>
effect tends to be impaired. Accordingly, it is<br>
effective to set the cooling section by off-pulses to at<br>
least 1 nsec, more preferably at lest 3 nsec as the real<br>
time by dividing the recording pulses at the time of nT<br>
mark recording.<br>
(D) Use of the information recording medium of the<br>
present invention other than as an optical recording<br>
medium<br>
On the information recording medium of the present<br>
invention, at least recording by a reversible phase<br>
change by irradiation with light is possible, and<br>
accordingly it can be used as an optical recording medium<br>
as described above. However, a rewritable information<br>
recording medium used in the present invention can be<br>
applied to recording by a phase change by applying an<br>
electric current to a microscopic region, for example.<br>
This point will be explained below.<br>
Fig. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating the<br>
temperature history at the time of amorphous mark<br>
recording (curve a) and the temperature history at the<br>
time of erasing by recrystallization (curve b). At the <br>
time of recording, the temperature of the recording layer<br><br>
is increased to at least the melting point Tm in a short<br>
time by heating with a high voltage and short pulse<br>
electric current or a high power level light beam, and<br>
after the application of the electric current pulse or<br>
irradiation with light beam is terminated, the recording<br>
layer, is rapidly cooled and becomes amorphous by heat<br>
dissipation to the periphery. When the cooling rate in a<br>
time τ0 when the temperature is decreased from the<br>
melting point Tm to the crystallization temperature Tg is<br>
higher than the critical cooling rate for forming an<br>
amorphous state, the recording layer becomes amorphous.<br>
On the other hand, at the time of erasing, by application<br>
of a relatively low voltage or irradiation with light<br>
energy at a low power level, the recording layer is<br>
heated to a temperature of at least the crystallization<br>
temperature Tg and approximately at most the melting<br>
point Tm, and is kept for at least a certain time,<br>
whereby recrystallization of the amorphous marks proceeds<br>
in a substantially solid state. Namely, if the holding<br>
time τ1 is sufficient, crystallization is completed.<br>
The recording layer becomes amorphous when the<br>
temperature history as illustrated by the curve a is<br>
applied to the recording layer and the recording layer is<br>
crystallized when the temperature history as illustrated<br>
by the curve b is applied to the recording layer, even if<br>
the recording layer before application of energy for<br>
recording or erasing is in any state.<br><br>
The reason why the rewritable information recording<br>
medium to be used in the present invention can be used<br>
not only as an optical recording medium but also for<br>
recording by a phase change by applying an electric<br>
current to a microscopic region, is as follows. Namely,<br>
it is the temperature history as illustrated in Fig. 3<br>
that causes a reversible phase change, and the energy<br>
source which causes such a temperature history may be<br>
either focused light beam or heating by electric current<br>
(Joule heating by current conducting).<br>
The change in the resistivity due to the phase<br>
change of the phase-change recording material to be used<br>
in the present invention between the crystalline state<br>
and the amorphous state is adequately comparable to the<br>
change in the resistivity of at least two digits as<br>
observed in a GeTe-Sb2Te3 pseudo-binary alloy which is<br>
being developed as a non-volatile memory at present,<br>
particularly a Ge2Sb2Te5 stoichiometric composition alloy<br>
(J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 87 (2000), pp. 4130-4133). In<br>
fact, of a rewritable information recording medium<br>
employing the phase-change recording material having the<br>
SbSnGeTeMl composition of the above formula (1) as the<br>
main component, the resistivity in an as-deposited<br>
amorphous state and the resistivity after crystallization<br>
by annealing were respectively measured, whereupon<br>
changes of at least three digits were confirmed (see the<br>
following Examples). Although it is considered that the<br><br>
amorphous state and the crystalline state obtained by<br>
amorphization and crystallization by electric current<br>
pulses are slightly different from the above as-deposited<br>
amorphous state and the crystalline state by annealing,<br>
respectively, it is expected that a significant change in<br>
the resistivity at a level of two digits will adequately<br>
be obtained even in a case of a phase change by electric<br>
current pulses of the phase-change recording material to<br>
be used in the present invention.<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view illustrating the<br>
structure of one cell of such a non-volatile memory (such<br>
a non-volatile memory is also disclosed in Collected<br>
Papers of Phase-Change Optical Information Storage<br>
Symposium, 2001, pp. 61-66). In Fig. 4, the electric<br>
voltage is applied to between an upper electrode 1 and a<br>
lower electrode 2, and electricity is applied to the<br>
phase-change recording layer 3 containing a phase-change<br>
recording material (hereinafter sometimes referred to<br>
simply as a phase-change recording layer 3) and a heater<br>
portion 4. The phase-change recording layer 3 is covered<br>
with an insulating material 10 of e.g. SiO2. Further,<br>
the phase-change recording layer 3 is crystallized in an<br>
initial state. The initial crystallization in such a<br>
case is carried out by heating the entire system of Fig.<br>
4 to a crystallization temperature of the recording layer<br>
(usually from about 100 to about 300°C). For formation<br>
of an integrated circuit, the rise in temperature to such<br><br>
an extent is commonly carried out.<br>
Further, on the portion 4 (heater portion) which is<br>
particularly thin in Fig. 4, heat generation due to Joule<br>
heating is likely to occur by conducting between the<br>
upper electrode 1 and the lower electrode 2, and<br>
accordingly it functions as a localized heater. A<br>
reversibly changeable portion 5 adjacent thereto is<br>
locally heated and becomes amorphous via the temperature<br>
history as illustrated by the curve a in Fig. 3, and<br>
recrystallized via the temperature history as illustrated<br>
in the curve b in Fig. 3.<br>
Read-out is carried out in such a manner that a low<br>
electric current to such an extent that heat generation<br>
at the heater portion 4 is ignorable is applied, and a<br>
potential difference generated between the upper and<br>
lower electrodes is read. There is also a difference in<br>
the electric capacity between the crystalline and<br>
amorphous states, and thus the difference in the electric<br>
capacity may also be detected.<br>
In fact, a more integrated memory by using the<br>
semiconductor integrated circuit formation technology has<br>
been proposed (U.S. Patent 6,314,014). Its basic<br>
structure is as illustrated in Fig. 4, and by<br>
incorporating the phase-change recording material to be<br>
used in the present invention into the phase-change<br>
recording layer 3, the same functions can be realized.<br>
As an energy source which causes a temperature<br><br>
change as illustrated in Fig. 3, electron beam may also<br>
be mentioned. As an example of a recording device<br>
employing electron beam, a method of generating a phase<br>
change on a phase-change recording material by locally<br>
irradiating electron beam emitted by a field emitter, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,557,596, may be mentioned.<br>
Now, Examples wherein the phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention is applied to an<br>
optical recording medium (the optical recording medium<br>
will sometimes be referred to simply as a disc in<br>
Examples) and Examples wherein the applicability of the<br>
phase-change recording material of the present invention<br>
to a rewritable information recording medium on which<br>
recording is carried out by a change in the electric<br>
resistance, will be explained. The following Examples<br>
are merely one embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
the present invention is by no means restricted to an<br>
optical recording medium and application to a rewritable<br>
information recording medium on which recording is<br>
carried out by a change in the electric resistance,<br>
unless they exceed the gist of the invention.<br>
In Examples of the optical recording medium, the<br>
reflectivity at a portion on which amorphous recording<br>
marks are formed, is relatively low as compared with the<br>
reflectivity in the crystalline state after the initial<br>
crystallization (in a non-recorded state) and after<br>
erasing. Further, the recording mark portions being in<br><br>
an amorphous state and the erased/non-recorded state<br>
being in a polycrystalline state in the recording layer<br>
of the optical recording medium were confirmed by<br>
observation of the recording layer by a transmission<br>
electron microscope. Further, the crystalline state was<br>
in a substantially single phase, and the crystal grain<br>
sizes were approximately at most about several urn.<br>
For measurement of the composition of the phase-<br>
change recording material used for a recording layer of<br>
an optical recording medium, acid dissolution ICP-AES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry)<br>
was employed. By using JY 38 S manufactured by JOBIN<br>
YVON as an analyzer, the recording layer was dissolved in<br>
diluted HNO3 (diluted nitric acid) and quantitative<br>
analysis was carried out by means of matrix matching<br>
calibration method.<br>
Measurement of the disc properties was carried out<br>
by using DDU1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co.,<br>
Ltd., by applying focus servo and tracking servo to<br>
grooves with a retrieving power of less than 1 mW.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 and 2 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 4<br>
On a disc-shape polycarbonate substrate with a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of approximately 0.5<br>
µm, a groove depth of approximately 40 nm and a groove<br>
pitch of 1.6 µm, a (ZnS)8o (SiO2)20 layer (80 nm) , a Ge-Sb-<br>
Sn recording layer (15 nm) , a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer (30<br><br>
nm) and a Al99.5Ta0.5 alloy reflective layer (200 nm) were<br>
formed by a sputtering method to prepare a phase-change<br>
optical disc.<br>
The values x and y when the recording layer<br>
composition is represented as (Sb1-xSnx)1-yGey are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Each of these discs was subjected to initial<br>
crystallization as follows. Namely, a laser light having<br>
a wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1,600 mW and having<br>
a shape with a width of about 1 µm and a length of about<br>
150 una was irradiated on the disc rotating at 12 m/s so<br>
that the major axis was perpendicular to the above guide<br>
grooves, and the laser light was continuously moved in a<br>
radius direction with a feed of 60 µm per rotation to<br>
carry out initialization.<br>
Then, EFM random signals were recorded at a linear<br>
velocity of 28.8 m/s by using a disc evaluation apparatus<br>
(DDU1000) having a laser wavelength of 780 nm and a<br>
pickup of NA0.5 as follows. Marks with lengths of from<br>
3T to 11T (T is a reference clock period and is 9.6 nsec)<br>
contained in the EFM signals were formed by irradiating a<br>
series of pulses of the following laser pulses connected<br>
in sequence.<br>
3T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 2T, pulse<br>
with a power Pb and a length 0.6T.<br>

An erasing power Pe was irradiated between pulses<br>
When each of the above laser pulses of 3T to 11T is<br>
represented by the notation system as shown in Fig. 2,<br>
αi and βi are as shown in Table 2. In the section αiT,<br>
a write power Pw is irradiated, and in the section βiT, a<br>
bias power Pb=0.8 mW is irradiated.<br><br><br>
for mark formation. Further, the irradiation position of<br>
the pulses for 3T mark formation was shifted toward ahead<br>
of the original position of the 3T mark in the EFM random<br>
signal by 0.3 5T (the irradiation was carried out at<br>
earlier timing than the original 3T mark in the EFM<br>
signal), and the irradiation position of the pulses for<br>
4T mark formation was shifted toward ahead of the<br>
original timing of the 4T mark in the EFM random signal<br>
by 0.1T. By doing this, the marks to be formed are<br>
closer to the original random signals. Further, during<br>
recording, the Pe/Pw ratio was fixed to 0.31 unless<br>
otherwise specified.<br>
The recorded part was retrieved at a linear velocity<br>
of 1.2 m/s to evaluate the properties of the recording<br>
signals.<br>
The results of evaluation of the discs of Examples 1<br>
and 2 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Items<br>
evaluated are 3T mark jitter and 3T space jitter of<br>
retrieving signals when EFM random signals were recorded<br>
by overwriting ten times while changing Pw in a range of<br>
from 22 to 28 mW (the results are shown in Fig. 5(a) and<br>
Fig. 6(a)), the reflectivity at a crystalline part (the<br>
results are shown in Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 6(b)), the signal<br>
amplitude defined by "(signal level reflectivity of<br>
crystallized part)-(signal level reflectivity of 11T mark<br>
part)" (the results are shown in Fig. 5(c) and Fig.<br>
6(c)), and 3T mark jitter and 3T space jitter of<br><br>
retrieving signals when repetitive direct overwriting was<br>
carried out by fixing the write power (the results are<br>
shown in Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 6(d)). The write power at<br>
the time of repetitive direct overwriting was 25 mW in<br>
Example 1 and 24 mW in Example 2.<br>
It is found from the results shown in Figs. 5(d) and<br>
6(d) that there is a recording condition under which the<br>
jitter value is adequately smaller than 40 nsec by 1,000<br>
times or less overwriting for each of the discs of<br>
Examples 1 and 2. Accordingly, it is found that each of<br>
the discs of Examples 1 and 2 is adequately practicable<br>
as a rewritable information recording medium from this<br>
viewpoint. In the vicinity of the recording layer<br>
composition of each of the discs of Examples 1 and 2,<br>
when the recording layer composition is represented as<br>
(Sb1-xSnx)1-yGey, the repetitive overwriting properties<br>
tend to be excellent when the value x is smaller, as<br>
shown by comparison of Figs. 6(d) and Fig. 5(d).<br>
Further, as shown from the comparison between Fig. 5(c)<br>
and Fig. 6(c),. the signal amplitude tends to be excellent<br>
when the value x is higher.<br>
Further, when a Sb-Sn-Ge-M1 composition was employed<br>
as the phase-change recording material, and Bi, Ta, W,<br>
Nb, N, O, C, Se, Al, Si, Zn or V was added in an amount<br>
of from about 1 to about 10 atomic% as the element Ml<br>
( (Sb1-xSnx)1-y-zGeYM1z wherein x=0.25, y=0.18 and 0.01≤z≤<br>
0.1 or x=0.32, y=0.18 and 0.01≤z≤0.1) in each of the<br><br>
discs of Examples 1 and 2, the same rewritable recording<br>
properties as those of the discs of Examples 1 and 2 were<br>
obtained.<br>
Further, when each of these discs was kept at 105°C<br>
for 3 hours and then the above recorded part was<br>
retrieved, whereupon no deterioration of the jitter of<br>
the recorded signals or signal amplitude was shown at<br>
all.<br>
As shown in Table 1, with respect to each of the<br>
discs of Comparative Example 1, no uniform increase in<br>
the reflectivity by the initial crystallization operation<br>
was shown, and there were always several parts on which<br>
the reflectivity was locally low in a track corresponding<br>
to one rotation of the disc. Further, as shown in Table<br>
1, no uniform initial crystallization could be carried<br>
out on each of the discs of Comparative Example 1 even by<br>
changing the crystallization speed by controlling the Ge<br>
amount.<br>
Further, of each of the discs of Comparative Example<br>
1, the noise level was higher than that of the disc of<br>
Example 1 by 13 dB when the noise level was measured at<br>
500 kHz by means of a spectrum analyzer (manufactured by<br>
ADVANTEST CORPORATION, TR4171) at a linear velocity of<br>
1.2 m/s with a resolution band width of 30 kHz with a<br>
video band width of 30 Hz.<br>
With respect to each of the discs of Comparative<br>
Example 1, initial crystallization was attempted also by<br><br>
irradiating DC laser light of from 6 to 12 W at a linear<br>
velocity of from 1.2 to 4.8 m/s by using a disc<br>
evaluation apparatus, however, no uniform increase in the<br>
reflectivity was shown, and the initial crystallization<br>
could not be favorably carried out. Recording of<br>
amorphous marks was attempted on each of the above discs<br>
on which no uniform initial crystallization could be<br>
carried out, the jitter was at least 40 nsec at the first<br>
recording. This means that the crystalline state and the<br>
amorphous state can not be utilized as a non-recorded<br>
state and a recorded state, respectively, in each of the<br>
discs of Comparative Example 1.<br>
From these results, it is found that when the phase-<br>
change recording material contains no Sn, use as an<br>
information recording medium utilizing the crystalline<br>
state as a non-recorded state and the amorphous state as<br>
a recorded state tends to be difficult.<br>
Further, of the disc of Comparative Example 3 also,<br>
no uniform increase in the reflectivity by the<br>
initialization operation was shown. This is considered<br>
to be because the phase change speed from the amorphous<br>
phase to the crystalline phase is too slow as the Ge<br>
content is high (y=0.35). With respect to the disc of<br>
Comparative Example 3, initial crystallization was<br>
attempted also by irradiating DC laser light of from 6 to<br>
12 mW at a linear velocity of from 1.2 to 4.8 m/s (at<br>
this linear velocity range, the disc is very close to a<br><br>
stationary state) by using a disc evaluation apparatus,<br>
however, no uniform increase in the reflectivity was<br>
shown, and the initial crystallization could not<br>
favorably be carried out. From these results, it is<br>
found that when the Ge content of the phase-change<br>
recording material is higher than 0.3, use as a<br>
rewritable information recording medium tends to be<br>
difficult.<br>
With respect to the disc of Comparative Example 2,<br>
although uniform reflectivity was obtained after the<br>
initial crystallization, no formation of amorphous marks<br>
could be performed. Further, formation of amorphous<br>
marks was attempted by changing the linear velocity,<br>
formation of amorphous marks could not be carried out at<br>
least at a linear velocity of at most 38.4 m/s. This is<br>
considered to be because the crystallization speed was<br>
too high as the Ge content was low (y=0.09), and<br>
accordingly the melted portion was recrystallized. From<br>
these results, it was found that when the Ge content of<br>
the phase-change recording material is lower than 0.1,<br>
use as a rewritable information recording medium is<br>
substantially difficult. A linear velocity of at least<br>
38.4 m/s could not be achieved due to restriction in view<br>
of apparatus in general, and thus amorphous mark<br>
formation is substantially impossible. Even if<br>
amorphization is achieved under an extremely special<br>
condition, such an amorphous mark should be easily<br><br>
recrystallized soon at room temperature. And thus, it is<br>
not suitable for storage media.<br>
With respect to each of the discs of Comparative<br>
Example 4, although uniform reflectivity was obtained<br>
after the initial crystallization, no 3T space jitter of<br>
at most 40 nsec could be obtained when<br>
recording/retrieving was carried out under the same<br>
conditions as in Examples 1 and 2. Further, discs of<br>
Comparative Example 4 by changing the Ge content thereby<br>
to change the crystallization speed were prepared as<br>
shown in Table 1, and the recording properties of these<br>
discs were examined. As a result, it was found that with<br>
respect to each disc of Comparative Example 4 wherein x<br>
is fixed to 0.59, it is difficult to satisfy both<br>
formation of amorphous marks and crystallization of<br>
amorphous marks even by changing the Ge content, and<br>
further, the signal amplitude is at a level of 0.05 and<br>
is small at least with a composition which provide a<br>
crystallization speed required for crystallization of the<br>
marks. Namely, if the Sn content is too high, use as a<br>
rewritable medium is substantially difficult.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
Each of the discs of Comparative Example 5 is a disc<br>
of Example 1 except that a phase-change recording<br>
material wherein Ge is replaced with In was used. Of<br>
each of the discs of Comparative Example 5, the values of<br>
x and y when the recording layer composition is<br><br>
represented as (Sb1-xSnx) 1-yIny, whether initial<br>
crystallization was possible or not and recording<br>
properties are shown in Table 1.<br>
In the phase-change recording material used for each<br>
of the discs of Comparative Example 5, the Sn amount was<br>
within a range of from 0.01 to 0.5 and the In amount is<br>
within a range in the vicinity of from 0.1 to 0.3 (within<br>
the range of Ge content in the present invention). With<br>
respect to each of these discs, although uniform<br>
reflectivity was obtained after the initial<br>
crystallization, formation of amorphous marks could not<br>
be performed at least at a linear velocity of at most<br>
38.4 m/s. Formation of amorphous marks could not be<br>
performed even by changing the In content.<br>
From these results, it is found that Ge is important<br>
for formation of amorphous marks, and use as an<br>
information recording medium is substantially difficult<br>
when Ge is replaced with In. With a composition<br>
(Sb0.73Sn0.27) 0.56In0.44 wherein the In amount was further<br>
increased, the recording material was changed to a state<br>
which was considered to be another crystalline state with<br>
a low reflectivity, at the time of initial<br>
crystallization.<br>
Accordingly, a favorable optical recording medium<br>
can be obtained with a composition (Sb1-xSnx) 1-yGey wherein<br>
0.01≤x≤0.5 and 0.1≤y≤0.3.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br><br>
The following experiment was carried out so as to<br>
examine whether the phase-change recording material of<br>
the present invention can be used as a recording material<br>
for an information recording medium on which recording is<br>
carried out by the change in the electric resistance.<br>
Namely, on a polycarbonate substrate with a diameter<br>
of 120 mm, a Ge0.18Sb0.66Sn0.16 ((Sb1-xSnx)1-yGey wherein x=0.2<br>
and y=0.18) amorphous film in a film thickness of 50 nm<br>
was formed by sputtering. After the resistivity of this<br>
amorphous film was measured, the film was crystallized<br>
and the resistivity of the film after recrystallization<br>
was measured again. The crystallization was chaired out<br>
under the same conditions as for the discs of Examples,<br>
and for measurement of the resistivity, a resistivity<br>
meter Loresta MP (MCP-T350) manufactured by DIA<br>
INSTRUMENTS was used. The resistivities before and after<br>
the crystallization were 1.03x10-1 Ωcm and 0.80x10-4 Ωcm,<br>
respectively, and it was found that there is a change in<br>
the resistivity by almost three orders of magnitude as<br>
between the amorphous state and the crystalline state.<br>
In the same method as mentioned above, on a<br>
polycarbonate substrate, a Ge0.17Sb0.75Sn0.08 ((Sb1-xSnx)1-YGey<br>
wherein x=0.1 and y=0.17) amorphous film was formed by<br>
sputtering, and the resistivities of the film in an<br>
amorphous state and in a crystalline state were measured.<br>
As a result, the resistivity in an amorphous state was<br>
5.96x10-1 Ωcm and the resistivity in a crystalline state<br><br>
was 0.8x10-4 Ωcm, and it was found that there is a change<br>
in the resistivity of almost three orders of magnitude as<br>
between the amorphous state and the crystalline state.<br>
Further, in the same method as mentioned above, on a<br>
polycarbonate substrate, a Ge0.16Sb0.84 ((Sb1-xSnx)1-yGeY<br>
wherein x=0 and y=0.16) amorphous film was formed by<br>
sputtering, and the resistivities of the film in an<br>
amorphous state and in a crystalline state were measured.<br>
As a result, the resistivity in an amorphous state was<br>
1.51x10-0 Ωcm and the resistivity in a crystalline state<br>
was 0.7x10-4 Qcm, and it was found that there is a change<br>
in the resistivity of almost four orders of magnitude as<br>
between the amorphous state and the crystalline state.<br>
From the results of measurement of the resistivities<br>
of the films formed from the three phase-change recording<br>
materials, it is found that the change in the resistivity<br>
as between the amorphous state and the crystalline state<br>
can be controlled by changing the Sn content in the<br>
phase-change recording material. Namely, it is found<br>
that the change in the resistivity as between the<br>
amorphous state and the crystalline state becomes<br>
significant when the Sn content is decreased.<br>
In a case where the phase-change recording material<br>
of the present invention is used for a non-volatile<br>
memory utilizing the change in the resistivity, a<br>
composition containing no Sn (0≤x in the composition<br>
(Sb1-xSnx)1-y-w-zGeyTewM1z) may be employed only to make the<br><br>
change in resistivity significant. However, usually, it<br>
is required to control the change in the resistivity to<br>
be within a predetermined range from the viewpoint of<br>
design of an electronic circuit into which the non-<br>
volatile memory is incorporated. Accordingly, by using a<br>
phase-change recording material containing Sn, a high<br>
performance non-volatile memory wherein the change in the<br>
resistivity is controlled to be within a predetermined<br>
range can be obtained.<br>
Further, a favorable change in the resistivity as<br>
between the amorphous state and the crystalline state can<br>
be obtained also by adding an element such as Te or the<br>
element Ml to the above GeSbSn ternary composition. In<br>
fact, on a polycarbonate substrate, a<br>
Ge0.08In0.11Sb0.65Sn0.11Te0.05 ((Sb1-xSnx)1-y-w-zGeYTewInz wherein<br>
x=0.14, y=0.08, w=0.05 and z=0.11) amorphous film was<br>
formed by sputtering, and the resistivities of the film<br>
in an amorphous state and in a crystalline state were<br>
measured. As a result, the resistivity in an amorphous<br>
state was 8.73X101 Ωcm and the resistivity in a<br>
crystalline state was 1.12x10-4 Ωcm, and it was found<br>
that there is a change in the resistivity of almost three<br>
orders of magnitude as between the amorphous state and<br>
the crystalline state.<br>
From the above experiment, it is found that the<br>
phase-change recording material to be used in the present<br>
invention can be applied to a rewritable information<br><br>
recording medium on which recording is carried out by the<br>
change in the electric resistance, since the difference<br>
in the resistivity due to a phase change as between the<br>
amorphous state and the crystalline state can be<br>
controlled to be within a predetermined range while the<br>
difference is made to be significant.<br>
EXAMPLES 4 to 11 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6<br>
For measurement of the composition of a phase-change<br>
recording material used for a recording layer of an<br>
optical recording medium, acid dissolution ICP-AES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry)<br>
and a X-ray fluorescent analyzer were employed.<br>
Regarding the acid dissolution ICP-AES, using JY 38 S<br>
manufactured by JOBIN YVON as an analyzer, the recording<br>
layer was dissolved in diluted HNO3 and quantitative<br>
evaluation was carried out by means of a matrix matching<br>
calibration method. As the X-ray fluorescent analyzer,<br>
RIX3001 manufactured by Rigaku Denki Kogyo K.K. was used.<br>
Measurement of the disc properties was carried out<br>
by using DDU1000 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL Co.,<br>
Ltd., by applying focus servo and tracking servo to<br>
grooves with a retrieving power of 0.8 mW.<br>
On a disc-shape polycarbonate substrate with a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of approximately 0.5<br>
urn, a groove depth of approximately 40 nm and a groove<br>
pitch of 1.6 µm, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer, a Ge-Sb-Sn-M1<br><br>
recording layer, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer and a Al99.5Ta0.5<br>
alloy reflective layer were formed by a sputtering<br>
method, whereby 8 types of phase-change optical discs<br>
were prepared (Comparative Example 6 and Examples 4 to<br>
10) . Similarly, a phase-change optical disc comprising a<br>
(ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer, a Ge-Sb-Sn-M recording layer, a<br>
(ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer, a germanium nitride layer and a Ag<br>
reflective layer was also prepared. (Example 11). The<br>
germanium nitride layer is an interfacial layer to<br>
prevent mutual diffusion of elements between the<br>
(ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer and the Ag layer.<br>
Of each disc, the film thickness and the values x, y<br>
and z when the recording layer composition is represented<br>
as (Sb1-xSnx)1-y-zGeyM1z are shown in Table 3. As evident<br>
from Table 3, film thicknesses of layers constituting the<br>
discs are slightly different. This is to make the<br>
reflectivity at the crystallized part and the signal<br>
amplitude be at the same level. The reflectivities at<br>
the crystallized part of all the discs except for<br>
Comparative Example 6 were within a range of from 19 to<br>
21%.<br><br><br><br>
Each of these discs was subjected to the initial<br>
crystallization as follows. Namely, laser light having a<br>
wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1,600 mW and having a<br>
shape with a width of about 1 urn and a length of about<br>
150 urn was irradiated on the disc rotating at 12 m/s so<br>
that the major axis was perpendicular to the above guide<br>
grooves, and the laser light was continuously moved in a<br>
radius direction with a feed of 60 urn per one rotation to<br>
carry out initialization. As this initialization<br>
conditions were not optimum depending upon the disc, DC<br>
laser light of 10 mW was irradiated once at a linear<br>
velocity of 4 m/s by using a disc evaluation apparatus<br>
having a laser wavelength of 780 nm and a pickup of<br>
NA0.5.<br>
The disc of Comparative Example 6 could not function<br>
as a recording medium as the change in the reflectivity<br>
by the above initialization operation was small.<br>
With respect to each of the discs of Example 4 and<br>
Examples 5 to 8, the noise at the initialized part was<br>
measured under the following conditions. Namely, the<br>
noise level at 50 0 kHz was measured by using a spectrum<br>
analyzer (TR4171 manufactured by ADVANTEST CORPORATION)<br>
at a linear velocity of 1.2 m/s with a evaluation band<br>
width of 30 kHz with a video band width of 30 Hz. The<br>
results are shown in Table 3 . The noise of each of the<br>
discs of Examples 5 to 8 is small as compared with the<br>
disc of Example 4. With the GeSbSn type material, the<br><br>
noise tends to be significant when the Sn content (the<br>
value x) is low. Accordingly, the noise of the disc of<br>
Example 4 wherein x=0.2 is slightly strong, however, in<br>
Examples 5 to 8 wherein the value of x is equal to or<br>
less than that of Example 4, the noise is apparently<br>
small, and it is found that the effect of reducing noise<br>
by addition of In, Pd, Pt or Ag is high.<br>
Then, EFM random signals were recorded on each of<br>
the discs of Examples 4, 5, 9, 10 and 11 (In added or not<br>
added system) at a linear velocity of 28.8 m/s by using a<br>
disc evaluation apparatus (DDU1000) having a layer<br>
wavelength of 780 nm and a pickup of NA0.5 as described<br>
hereinafter. Marks with lengths of from 3T to 11T (T is<br>
a reference clock period and is 9.6 nsec) contained in<br>
the EFM signals were formed by irradiating a series of<br>
pulses of the following laser pulses connected in<br>
sequence.<br>
3T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 2T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.6T.<br>

and a length 0.3T.<br>

with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.35T, pulse with a<br>
power Pw and a length 1.45T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW<br>
and a length 0.3T.<br><br>
6T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.9T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
7T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.35T, pulse with a<br>
power Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.4T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
8T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.9T, pulse with a power<br>

length 0.3T.<br>
9T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.35T, pulse with a<br>
power Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1.4T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.3T.<br>
10T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br><br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.9T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
11T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.35T, pulse with a<br>
power Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.4T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
An erasing power Pe was irradiated between the above<br>
pulses for mark formation. Further, the irradiation<br>
position of the pulses for 3T mark formation was shifted<br>
toward ahead of the original position of the 3T mark in<br>
the EFM random signals by 0.35T (the irradiation was<br>
carried out at earlier timing than the original 3T mark<br>
in the EFM signal), and the irradiation position of the<br>
pulses for 4T mark formation was shifted toward ahead of<br>
the original timing of the 4T mark in the EFM random<br>
signals by 0.1T. By doing this, marks to be formed are<br>
closer to the original EFM random signals. Further, the<br>
Pe/Pw ratio was fixed at 0.31 during recording.<br>
On each of the discs, the above EFM random signals<br>
were recorded by overwriting ten times by using such a<br><br>
write power that the jitter with a length between marks<br>
corresponding to a length 3T (hereinafter referred to as<br>
3T space jitter") becomes almost minimum after recording<br>
by overwriting ten times with changing the write power Pw<br>
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "recording before<br>
aging"), and the 3T space jitter was measured. The value<br>
of 3T space jitter and the value of the write power are<br>
shown in Table 3. In Table 3, the values of the 3T space<br>
jitter and the write power are shown in the column<br>
"recording before aging".<br>
Then, each of the discs of Examples 5, 9, 10 and 11<br>
was held in an environment of 105°C for 3 hours (aging<br>
test) . Then, the recorded part was retrieved<br>
(hereinafter sometimes be referred to as "after aging"),<br>
and the 3T space jitter was measured. The values of the<br>
3T space jitter is shown in Table 3. In Table 3, the<br>
value of the 3T space jitter is shown in the column<br>
"after aging".<br>
Further, EFM random signals were recorded once on<br>
the recorded part before aging while changing the write<br>
power after the aging test (hereinafter sometimes be<br>
referred to as "recording after aging"), and the 3T space<br>
jitter was measured. The value of the smallest 3T space<br>
jitter and the write power are shown in Table 3. In<br>
Table 3, the values of the 3T space jitter and the write<br>
power are shown in the column "recording after aging".<br>
This aging test was carried out under very severe<br><br>
conditions as compared with a conventional environmental<br>
test. Thus, if the properties after this aging test<br>
deteriorate, it can be said that the performances of the<br>
disc in practical use are adequately secured.<br>
Retrieving of the recording marks was carried out at<br>
a linear velocity of 1.2 m/s.<br>
Although the noise of the disc of Example 4 is<br>
somewhat significant, the 3T space jitter by recording<br>
before aging was at most 40 nsec, and the disc was<br>
adequately practicable.<br>
The jitter properties (the value of 3T space jitter)<br>
of the disc of Example 9 by recording before aging are<br>
better than those of the disc of Example 4 since the Sn<br>
content is high (the value x is high). However, the<br>
value of 3T space jitter by recording after aging is 48.8<br>
nsec and is slightly high. On the other hand, with<br>
respect to each of the discs of Example 5, 10 and 11<br>
wherein In was added to a composition with a small Sn (a<br>
small x), it is found that the value of 3T space jitter<br>
by recording after aging is improved.<br>
As shown from the comparison between Example 10 and<br>
Example 11 using substantially same recording layer<br>
compositions, the recording properties after aging become<br>
better by employing Ag as the reflective layer.<br>
Further, no deterioration of the jitter at the<br>
recorded part before aging due to the aging test was<br>
shown on any disc, and it is found that the amorphous<br><br>
marks are adequately stable.<br>
EXAMPLE 12 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 7<br>
Disks were prepared in the same manner as mentioned<br>
above (Examples 4 to 11 and Comparative Example 6) except<br>
that Te was used as the element to be added, and the Te<br>
content was 5 atomic% (Example 12) or 11 atomic%<br>
(Comparative Example 7), and each of the discs was<br>
evaluated. Of each of the discs, the film thickness and<br>
the values of x, y and w when the recording layer<br>
composition is represented as (Sb1-xSnx)1-y-wGeyTew are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br><br><br><br>
With respect to the disc of Example 12, the<br>
recording properties after aging at the same level as the<br>
above Examples 5 and 10 were obtained, and it is found<br>
that the recording properties after aging are favorable<br>
by addition of Te. The reflectivity at the crystallized<br>
part of the disc of Example 12 was 16.6% and showed a<br>
value slightly lower than those of discs of other<br>
Examples.<br>
The disc of Comparative Example 7 was not a<br>
practicable phase-change optical disc as the reflectivity<br>
in a crystalline state was so low as 12.1% and the signal<br>
amplitude was low.<br>
Further, no deterioration of the jitter at the<br>
recorded part before aging due to the aging test was<br>
shown on the disc of Example 12 also, and it is found<br>
that the amorphous marks are adequately stable.<br>
EXAMPLES 13 to 17<br>
For measurement of the composition of a phase-change<br>
recording material used for a recording layer of an<br>
optical recording medium, acid dissolution ICP-AES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry)<br>
and a X-ray fluorescent analyzer were employed.<br>
Regarding the acid dissolution ICP-AES, using JY 38 S<br>
manufactured by JOBIN YVON as an analyzer, the recording<br>
layer was dissolved in diluted HNO3 and quantitative<br>
evaluation was carried out by means of a matrix matching<br>
calibration method. As the X-ray fluorescent analyzer,<br><br>
RIX3001 manufactured by Rigaku Denki Kogyo K.K. was used.<br>
Measurement of the disc properties was carried out<br>
by using DDU1000 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL Co.,<br>
Ltd., by applying focus servo and tracking servo to<br>
grooves with a retrieving power of 0.8 mW.<br>
On a disc-shape polycarbonate substrate with a<br>
diameter of 12 0 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width of approximately 0.5<br>
µm, a groove depth of approximately 40 nm and a groove<br>
pitch of 1.6 µm, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer, a Ge-Sb-Sn-M1<br>
recording layer, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer and a Al99.5Ta0.5<br>
alloy reflective layer were formed by a sputtering<br>
method, whereby two types of phase-change optical discs<br>
wherein Ml was Tb and Gd, respectively (Examples 13 and<br>
14) were prepared. Namely, Tb was used as the element Ml<br>
in Example 13, and Gd was used as the element Ml in<br>
Example 14.<br>
Then, the same phase-change optical disc of Example<br>
4 except that the reflective layer was a Ag reflective<br>
layer, and a germanium nitride layer was inserted between<br>
the reflective layer and the protective layer was<br>
prepared (Example 15). Similarly, the same phase-change<br>
optical discs of Examples 13 and 14 except that the<br>
reflective layer was a Ag reflective layer, and a<br>
germanium nitride layer was inserted between the<br>
reflective layer and the protective layer, were prepared<br>
(Examples 16 and 17). The reason why the germanium<br><br>
nitride layer was inserted between the reflective layer<br>
and the protective layer in the case of using the Ag<br>
reflective layer is to prevent mutual diffusion of<br>
elements between the (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 protective layer and<br>
the Ag reflective layer.<br>
The element Ml, the layer structure, the film<br>
thickness and the values of x, y and z when the recording<br>
layer composition is represented as (Sb1-xSnx)1-y-zGeyM1z,<br>
of each of the discs of Examples 4, 13 and 14 are shown<br>
in Table 5.<br><br><br><br>
Each of the discs was subjected to initial<br>
crystallization as follows. Namely, laser light having a<br>
wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1,600 mW and having a<br>
shape with a width of about 1 urn and a length of about<br>
150 µm was irradiated on the disc rotating at 12 m/s so<br>
that the major axis was perpendicular to the above guide<br>
grooves, and the laser light was continuously moved in a<br>
radius direction with a feed of 60 µm per one rotation.<br>
Then, DC laser light of 10 mW was irradiated once at a<br>
linear velocity of 4 m/s by using a disc evaluation<br>
apparatus having a laser wavelength of 780 nm and a<br>
pickup of NA0.5.<br>
The reflectivity at the crystallized part of each of<br>
the discs of Examples 13 and 14 after initial<br>
crystallization was within a range of from 19 to 21%.<br>
Further, the reflectivity at the crystallized part of the<br>
disc of Example 4 after initial crystallization was also<br>
within a range of from 19 to 21% (see Example 4).<br>
Each of the discs of Examples 13 and 14 was<br>
subjected to noise measurement in the same manner as the<br>
discs of Example 4 and Examples 5 to 8. The results are<br>
shown in Table 5. The noise of each of the discs of<br>
Examples 13 and 14 was small as compared with the disc of<br>
Example 4, and it is found that the effect of reducing<br>
the noise is high by addition of a lanthanoid such as Tb<br>
or Gd i.e. a rare earth element.<br>
Then, repetitive overwriting durability of each of<br><br>
the discs of Examples 15 to 17 was measured by using a<br>
disc evaluation apparatus having a laser wavelength of<br>
780 nm and a pickup of NA0.5. EFM random signals were<br>
recorded at a linear velocity of 28.8 m/s as mentioned<br>
hereinafter. Marks with lengths of from 3T to 11T (T is<br>
a reference clock period and is 9.6 nsec) contained in<br>
EFM signals were formed by irradiating a series of pulses<br>
of the following laser pulses connected in sequence.<br>
3T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 2T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.6T.<br>
4T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.95T, pulse with a<br>
power Pw and a length 1.15T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW<br>
and a length 0.3T.<br>
5T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.4T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1.55T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.3T.<br>
6T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.9T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T,<br>
pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
7T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.4T, Pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length IT, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.5T, pulse<br><br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
8T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.9T, pulse with a power<br>

length 0.3T.<br>
9T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.4T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1.5T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.3T.<br>
10T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 0.9T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T,<br>
pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
11T: Pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.1T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1.4T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>

with a power 0.8 mW and a length 1T, pulse with a power<br>
Pw and a length 1T, pulse with a power 0.8 mW and a<br>
length 1T, pulse with a power Pw and a length 1.5T, pulse<br>
with a power 0.8 mW and a length 0.3T.<br>
An erasing power Pe was irradiated between the above<br>
pulses for mark formation. The irradiation position of<br>
the pulses for 3T mark formation was shifted toward ahead<br>
of the original position of the 3T mark in the EFM random<br>
signal by 0.3T (the irradiation was carried out at<br>
earlier timing than the original 3T mark in the EFM<br>
signal), and the irradiation position of pulses for 4T<br>
mark formation was shifted toward ahead of the original<br>
timing of the 4T mark in the EFM random signal by 0.1T.<br>
By doing this, the marks to be formed are closer to the<br>
original EFM random signals. Further, Pe/Pw = 8 mW/26 mW<br>
at the time of recording.<br>
The relation between the number of repetitive<br>
overwriting and the 3T space jitter of each of the discs<br>
of Examples 15 to 17 is shown in Fig. 7. Retrieving was<br>
carried out at 1.2 m/s. Each of the discs of Examples 15<br>
to 17 provides favorable jitter properties until the<br>
number of repetitive overwriting is 1,000 times, and it<br>
is found that they are discs having no problem in view of<br>
practical use. However, with respect to the disc of<br>
Example 15, as the number of repetitive overwriting was<br>
further increased, the 3T space jitter became 46.2 nsec<br>
at the time of overwriting for 2,000 times. It is<br><br>
considered that since no lanthanoid element i.e. rare<br>
earth element was contained in the phase-change recording<br>
material of the disc of Example 15, the crystallization<br>
speed decreased due to the repetitive overwriting, and<br>
erasing of the marks was incomplete, whereby the jitter<br>
increased. On the other hand, each of the discs of<br>
Examples 16 and 17 wherein a lanthanoid (Tb, Gd) was<br>
incorporated into the phase-change recording material<br>
showed a favorable jitter value even after overwriting<br>
for 2,000 times. This is considered to be because<br>
decrease of the crystallization speed due to increase in<br>
the number of the repetitive overwriting is reduced by<br>
addition of a lanthanoid.<br>
REFERENCE EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following experiment was carried out to examine<br>
whether the recording layer composition used for the disc<br>
of Example 15 is suitable for formation of crystalline<br>
marks, i.e. whether it is possible to record crystalline<br>
marks in the amorphous film after sputtering of the<br>
recording layer.<br>
The disc used for the experiment was prepared in the<br>
same manner as in Example 15 except that the film<br>
thickness of the (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer adjacent to the<br>
substrate was 150 nm. This is because the reflectivity<br>
of the amorphous film in a state where sputtering of the<br>
recording layer was carried out (non-recorded state in a<br>
case of forming crystalline marks) of the disc of Example<br><br>
15 as it was, was low, and no focus servo could be<br>
applied, and thus the film thickness of the<br>
(ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer was made thicker than that of<br>
Example 15 to increase the reflectivity of the amorphous<br>
film and thereby to apply focus servo. As a result of<br>
making the film thickness of the (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer<br>
adjacent to the substrate 150 nm, the reflectivity of the<br>
amorphous film was 7%, whereby focus servo and tracking<br>
servo could be applied.<br>
DC laser light of from 5 to 20 mW was irradiated<br>
once at a linear velocity of 28.8 m/s by using a disc<br>
evaluation apparatus (DDU1000 manufactured by Pulstec<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd.), however, no crystallization took<br>
place at all. Taking that the erasing power Pe (the<br>
erasing power is a power to erase the amorphous marks<br>
i.e. a crystallization power) was 8 mW in Example 15 into<br>
consideration, the above DC laser light of from 5 to 20<br>
mW provides an adequately wide range of laser power so as<br>
to confirm whether the crystalline marks can be formed or<br>
not. As no crystalline phase marks could be formed even<br>
with such a wide range of laser power, it can be said<br>
that recording of crystalline marks on the amorphous film<br>
of the disc is very difficult. Namely, it is considered<br>
that substantially no crystalline nuclei are present in<br>
the amorphous recording layer of the disc immediately<br>
after film formation, or even if they are present, they<br>
are not so dense as to form crystalline marks.<br><br>
Further, when the above DC laser light was<br>
irradiated several times, crystallization took place and<br>
an increase in the reflectivity was observed. However,<br>
the increase in the reflectivity was not uniform, and it<br>
was observed that a part which was likely to be<br>
crystallized and a part which was hardly crystallized<br>
were mingled. This indicates that crystalline nuclei are<br>
not originally present in such a number that crystalline<br>
marks having a high signal quality can be formed, in the<br>
recording layer composition of Example 15. Accordingly,<br>
even by carrying out a pretreatment such as irradiation<br>
with laser on the disc, the number of the crystalline<br>
nuclei in the recording layer in an amorphous state is<br>
originally small, and thus it is difficult to form<br>
crystalline marks having recording properties which can<br>
be used practically.<br>
Accordingly, it is found that the density of the<br>
crystalline nuclei is very low in the phase-change<br>
recording material of the present invention in an<br>
amorphous state particularly in an amorphous state<br>
immediately after film formation by sputtering.<br>
Accordingly, it is found that on an information recording<br>
medium employing this phase-change recording material, it<br>
is very difficult to apply a recording method utilizing<br>
the crystalline state as recording marks.<br>
EXAMPLES 18 and 19 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 8 and 9<br>
For measurement of the composition of a phase-change<br><br>
recording material used for a recording layer of an<br>
optical recording medium, acid dissolution ICP-AES<br>
(Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry)<br>
and a X-ray fluorescent analyzer were employed.<br>
Regarding the acid dissolution ICP-AES, using JY 38 S<br>
manufactured by JOBIN YVON as an analyzer, the recording<br>
layer was dissolved in diluted HNO3 and quantitative<br>
evaluation was carried out by means of a matrix matching<br>
calibration method. As the X-ray fluorescent analyzer,<br>
RIX3001 manufactured by Rigaku Denki Kogyo K.K. was used.<br>
Measurement of the disc properties was carried out<br>
by using DDU1000 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL Co.,<br>

grooves with a retrieving power of 0.8 mW.<br>
On a disc-shape polycarbonate substrate with a<br>
diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm, having<br>
guide grooves with a groove width, of approximately 0.5<br>
µm, a groove depth of approximately 40 nm and a groove<br>
pitch of 1.6 urn, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer, a Ge-Sb-Sn-M1-T<br>
recording layer, a (ZnS)80(SiO2)20 layer, a Ta layer and a<br>
Ag reflective layer were formed by a sputtering method,<br>
whereby phase-change optical discs wherein M1 was In were<br>
prepared (Examples 18 and 19 and Comparative Example 8).<br>
The reason why the Ta layer was inserted between the<br>
reflective layer and the protective layer in the case of<br>
using the Ag reflective layer is to prevent mutual<br>
diffusion of elements between the (ZnS)80(SiO2)20<br><br>
protective layer and the Ag reflective layer. In<br>
Comparative Example 9, no In was used as the element Ml,<br>
and a Ag99.5Ta0.5 reflective layer was formed instead of<br>
the Ta layer and the Ag reflective layer.<br>
The element Ml, the layer structure, the film<br>
thickness and the values of x, y, z and w when the<br>
recording layer composition is represented as<br>
(Sb1-xSnx)1-y-zGeyM1zTaw, of each disc are shown in Table 6.<br><br><br><br>
Each of the discs was subjected to initial<br>
crystallization as follows. Namely, laser light having a<br>
wavelength of 810 nm and a power of 1,600 mW and having a<br>
shape with a width of about 1 urn and a length of about<br>
150 µm was irradiated on the disc rotating at 12 m/s so<br>
that the major axis was perpendicular to the above guide<br>
grooves, and the laser light was continuously moved in a<br>
radius direction with a feed of 60 µm per one rotation.<br>
Then, of each of the discs of Examples 18, 19 and<br>
Comparative Examples 8 and 9, recording signal properties<br>
after overwriting for 10 times were measured by using a<br>
disc evaluation apparatus having a laser wavelength of<br>
780 nm and a pickup of NA0.5.<br>

0.07, which is a considerably small value as compared<br>
with the value y of Example 1 for example. This<br>
indicates that the Ge amount can be decreased by<br>
incorporation of Te or In as compared with discs having<br><br>
the same level of crystallization speed.<br>
Recording was carried out on the disc of Example 19<br>
under the following conditions. EFM random signals were<br>
recorded at a linear velocity of 38.4 m/s as mentioned<br>

An erasing power Pe was irradiated between the above<br>
pulses for mark formation. Further, the irradiation<br>
position of the pulses for 3T mark formation was shifted<br>
toward ahead of the original timing of the 3T mark in the<br>
EFM random signals by 0.06T (irradiation was carried out<br>
at earlier time than the original 3T mark in the EFM<br>
signal). By doing this, the marks to be formed are<br>
closer to the original EFM random signals. Pe/Pw=0.25<br>
during recording.<br>
The values of 3T space jitter and Pw after 10 times<br>
overwriting are shown in Table 6. Retrieving was carried<br>
out at 1.2 m/s. It is found from Table 6 that the disc<br>
of Example 19 has excellent overwriting jitter<br>
properties. The value y representing the Ge amount is<br>
0.04. It is found that the Ge amount can be decreased by<br>
incorporation of Te or In. This indicates that the Ge<br>
amount can be decreased by incorporation of Te or In as<br>
compared with discs having the same level of<br>
crystallization speed.<br>
On the other hand, on each of the discs of<br><br>
Comparative Examples 8 and 9 containing no Ge, amorphous<br>
marks could not adequately be formed at least at a linear<br>
velocity of at most 38.4 m/s. Accordingly, use as an<br>
information recording medium is substantially difficult.<br>
According to the present invention, a phase-change<br>
recording material of which the phase change speed is<br>
high, on which a high speed recording/erasing is<br>
possible, which is excellent in storage stability, of<br>
which the signal intensity is high, of with which high<br>
speed initialization is possible, can be obtained, and an<br>
information recording medium employing it can be<br>
obtained. When the phase-change recording material of<br>
the present invention is used for a rewritable<br>
information recording medium, particularly favorable<br>
recording properties can be obtained.<br>
Further, when a phase-change recording material of<br>
the present invention is used for an optical recording<br>
medium particularly a rewritable optical recording<br>
medium, an optical recording medium on which high speed<br>
recording/erasing is possible, with which storage<br>
stability of amorphous marks are excellent, which are<br>
excellent in jitter properties, which has a high<br>
reflectivity and signal amplitude, and which is excellent<br>
in repetitive overwriting properties and further,<br>
overwriting properties in overwriting is carried out on<br>
recording marks after long-term storage, can be obtained.<br>
Further, by using the phase-change recording<br><br>
material of the present invention, an information<br>
recording medium with a high productivity can be<br>
obtained. Particularly when a phase-change recording<br>
material of the present invention is used for an optical<br>
recording medium, an optical recording medium of which<br>
initial crystallization is easy and which remarkably<br>
improves the productivity can be obtained.<br>
The present invention has been described in detail<br>
with reference to specific embodiments, but it is obvious<br>
for the person skilled in the art that various changes<br>
and modifications were possible without departing from<br>
the intention and the scope of the present invention.<br>
