depending on which salt is desired-in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>
On the other hand, salts with bases are-depending on substitution-also suitable. As examples of salts with bases are mentioned the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, magnesium, titanium, ammonium, meglumine or guanidinium salts, here, too, the bases being employed in salt preparation in an equimolar quantitative ratio or one differing therefrom.<br>
Pharmacologically intolerable salts, which can be obtained, for example, as process products during the preparation of the compounds according to the invention on an industrial scale, are converted into phaematcalogcally toterable salts by processes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
According to expert"s knowledge the compounds of the invention as well as their salts may contain, e.g. when isolated in crystalline form, varying amounts of solvents. Included within the scope of the invention are therefore all solvates and in particular all hydrates of the compounds of formula I as well as all solvates and in particular all hydrates of the salts of the compounds of formula I.<br>
A person skilled in the art knows on the base of his/her expert knowledge that the compounds according to this irtvention can exist, with regard to the fused imidazo ring, in different tautomeric forms such as e.g. in the 1-H form or, preferably, in the 3-H form, which is shown in formula I. The invention includes all conceivable tautomers in pure form as well as in any mixing ratio. Particularly the present invention includes the pure 1-H-and, preferably, 3-H-tautomers as well as any mixtures thereof.<br>

Thus, as shown in reaction scheme 1 below, a compound of formula II, in which R4, R5 and A have the meanings given above and X is a suitable leaving group, preferably bromine or, particularly, iodine, is reacted with boronic acids or, particularly, boronic acid esters (e. g. pinacol esters) of formula III, in which Rl, R2 and R3 have the meanings given above and Y is a boronic acid group or, particularly, a boronic acid ester group, suitably a cyclic boronic acid ester group such as, for example, the boronic acid pinacol ester group, under conditions appropriate for a Suzuki reaction to occur to give compounds of formula I, in which Rl, R2, R3, R4, R5 and A have the meanings mentioned above.<br>
Reaction Scheme 1:<br><br>
Suitably, the Suzuki reaction is carried out as it is known to the person of ordinary skill in the art and/ or in a manner as it is described below and specified by way of example in the following examples or analogously or similarly thereto.<br>
In more detail, the Suzuki reaction mentioned can be carried out in organic solvents alone, for example in toluene, benzene, dimethylformamide or in ethereal (e. g. dimethoxyethane or, in particular, dioxane) or alcohol solvents or in a mixture thereof, or preferably in a mixture comprising an organic solvent (in particular dioxane) and water, with organic (e. g. triethylamine) or preferably inorganic base (e.<br><br>
g. potassium hydroxide, thallium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, cesium carbonate, cesium fluoride or, in particular, potassium carbonate) in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, for example, a nickel or, in particular, palladium catalyst (e. g. Pd (OAc)2, PdCk (PPh3)2 or, in particular, Pd(PPh3)4), and, optionally, lithium chloride. The reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range from 20° to 160°C, usually 60° to 130°C for 10 minutes to 5 days, usually 30 minutes to 24 hours. Advantageously, the solvents used are degassed and the reaction is carried out under protective gas.<br>
The Suzuki reaction is for example described in Tetrahedron Lett. 1998,39, 4467, J. Org. Chem. 1999,64, 1372 or Heterocycles 1992,34,1395. A general review of Suzuki cross-couplings between boronic acids and aryl halides can be found in Miyaura, N; Suzuki, A. Chem. Rev. 1995,95, 2457.<br>
Boronic acids or boronic acid esters (e. g. pinacol esters) of formula III, in which Rl, R2, R3 and Y have the meanings given above, are known or can be obtained in an art-known manner or analogously or similarly to known compounds. Boronic acid esters (e. g. pinacol esters) of formula III can be prepared, for example, as described in the following examples starting from phenyl triflates or, particularly, phenyl halides, preferably the bromides or iodides, using e. g. bis- (pinacolato)-diboron in the presence of a transition metal, preferably palladium, catalyst. Optionally the boronic acid esters obtained can be isolated or, preferably, they are generated in situ and used in the subsequent Suzuki reaction without isolation.<br>
Compounds of formula II, in which R4, R5, X and A have the meanings given above, are obtained as exemplarily described in the following examples or shown in the following reaction scheme 2 or similarly or analogously thereto.<br>
In the following reaction scheme 2 the synthesis of compounds of formula II, in which R4, R5 and X have the meanings given above and A is ethylene, is exemplarily described.<br>
Reaction Scheme 2:<br><br><br><br>
The carbon chain in 2-position of the compounds of formula VII is lengthened, for example, by a condensation (with a malonic acid derivative) and a subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Alternatively, the carbon chain can be lengthened using a Wittig reaction followed by a hydrogenation reaction.<br>
The methyl 3-(4-(l-4C)-alkoxypyridin-2-yl) propionate (compound of formula V) or the corresponding acid (compound of formula IV), which can be obtained in an art-known manner, are converted with a 2,3-diaminopyridine derivative (compound of formula III) to give the desired compounds of formula II.<br>
The synthesis of 4-methoxy-pyridin-2-carbaldehyde (compound of formula VII) is described for example in Ashimori et al, Chem Pharm Bull 38,2446-2458 (1990).<br>
Compounds of formula VII can be also prepared starting from commercially available 4-nitro-2-picoline-N-oxide by exchange of the nitro group by an 1-4C-alkoxy group. The resulting 4-(l-4C)-alkoxy-2-picoline-N-oxide is then via a rearrangement and an oxidation step converted to 4-(l-4C)-alkoxy-pyridin-2-carbaldehyd (compound of formula VII).<br>
The synthesis of 3-(4-methoxypyridin-2-yl) propionic acid (compound of formula IV) is described in the paragraph Starting Materials.<br>
Compounds of formula III, in which R4 and X have the meanings indicated above, are known or can be prepared in a known manner or analogously or similarly to the preparation of art-known compounds.<br>
Optionally, compounds of formula I can be converted into their salts, or, optionally, salts of the compounds of formula I can be converted into the free compounds. Corresponding processes are known to the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I according to this invention can be converted, optionally, into their N-oxides, for example with the aid of hydrogen peroxide in methanol or with the aid of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane. The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with the reaction conditions which are specifically necessary for carrying out the N-oxidation.<br>
It is known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, 3rd Ed, or in P. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000.<br>
The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, e. g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatography on a suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone like acetone, methylethylketone, or methylisobutylketone, an ether, like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which the desired acid is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a non- solvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by basi-fication into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner, pharma-cologically non-tolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
Suitably, the conversions mentioned in this invention can be carried out analogously or similarly to methods which are familiar per se to the person skilled in the art, for example, in the manner which is described by way of example in the following examples.<br>
The person skilled in the art knows on the basis of his/her knowledge and on the basis of those synthesis routes, which are shown and described within the description of this invention, how to find other possible synthesis routes for compounds according to this invention. All these other possible synthesis routes are also part of this invention.<br>

Starting materials:<br>
Al.     2-[2-(4-Methoxypyridin-2-yl) ethyl]-6-iodo-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine<br>
With stirring, a mixture of 8.06 g of 3- (4-methoxypyridin-2-yl) propionic acid (starting material Bl), 9.5 g of 2, 3-diamino-5-iodopyridine (Cugola et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 22, 2749-2754 (1996)) and 150 g of polyphosphoric acid (PPA) is heated at 140°C for 22 hours. After cooling, the mixture is poured into about 1000 ml of ice-water and then neutralized (pH 7-8) using 6N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is extracted four times with ethyl acetate and the combined organic phases are evaporated to dryness. The residue is crystallized first from ethyl acetate and then from methanol, giving 9.4 g of the title compound as a light-beige powder of m. p. 207-208°C ; the mass spectrum shows the molecular peak MH+ at 381.2 Da.<br>
Bl.      3-(4-Methoxypyridin-2-yl) propionic acid<br>
41.95 g of methyl 3- (4-methoxypyridin-2-yl) propionate (starring material C1) are dissolved in 700 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and 217 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide solution are added. The mixture is stirred at RT until no more starring material is detectable (TLC). The mixture is neutralized using 217 ml of 1N hydrochloric acid solution, evaporated to dryness and dried under high vacuum. The colorless residue is ground and extracted four times with dichloromethane/methanol (9:1). The combined extracts are evaporated to dryness. This gives 33.2 g of the title compound as a colorless powder of m. p. 131- 132°C. The mass spectrum shows the molecular peak MH+at 182   Da.<br>
C1.     Methyl - (4-methoxypyridin-2-yl) propionate<br><br>
43.1 g of methyl 3-(4-methoxypyridin-2-yl) acrylate (starting material Dl) in 600 ml of methanol are hydrogenated over 3.0 g of Pd/C (10% strength) until the starting material has disappeared (TLC). The catalyst is filtered off, and the mixture is then concentrated and dried under high vacuum. This gives 41.95 g of the title compound as a light-yellow oil. The mass spectrum shows the molecular peak MH+ at 196 Da.<br>
Dl.     Methyl 3-(4-methoxypyridin-2-yl) acrylate<br>
A mixture of 45 g of 4-methoxypyridine-2-carbaldehyde (Ashimori et al„ Chem. Pharm. Bull. 38,2446- 2458 (1990)), 75.80 g of pyridine hydrochloride, 102.45 g of monomethyl malonate potassium salt and 4.1 ml of piperidine in 700 ml of pyridine are slowly heated, with stirring, to 120°C. When the evolution of gas starts, the hearing source is temporarily removed to stop the reaction from becoming too violent. Once the reaction has subsided, the mixture is stirred at 120°C for a further 2.5 hours, and the pyridine is-then distilled off under reduced pressure. The residue is partitioned between ethyl acetate/water and the organic phase is washed with water and dried. The residue obtained after concentration is chromatographed on a silica gel column using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether 2: 1. This initially gives 43.2 g of the title compound as a yellow oil which crystallizes on standing and then shows a m. p. of 80-82°C The mass spectrum shows the molecular peak MH+ at 194 Da.<br>
Commercial apiplicability<br>
The compounds according to the invention have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. They are selective inhibitors of the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide synthases (NO-syntases, NOSs) are enzymes that generate NO and citrulline from the amino acid arginine. In certain pathophysiological situations such as arginine depletion or tetrahydrobiopterin depletion the generation of O2 from NO-synthases instead or together with NO has been reported. NO is long known as a signalling molecule in most living organisms including mammals and humans. The most prominent action of NO is it"s smooth muscle relaxing activity, which is caused on the molecular level by the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. In the last years a lot of other enzymes have been shown to be regulated by NO or reaction products of NO. There exist three isoforms of NO-synthases which fall into two classes and differ in their physiologic functions and molecular properties. The first class, known as constitutive NO-synthases, comprises of the endothelial NO-synthase and the neuronal NO-synthase. Both isoenzymes are expressed constitutively in various cell types, but are most prominent in endothelial cells of blood vessel walls (therefore called endothelial NO-synthase, eNOS or NOS-III) and in neuronal cells (therefore called neuronal NO-synthase, nNOS or NOS-I). Activation of these two enzymes is dependent on Ca2+/Calmodulin which is generated by transient increases of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. Activation of constitutive isoforms leads to transient bursts of nitric oxide resulting in nanomolar cellular or tissue NO concentrations. The endothelial isoform is involved in the physiologic regulation of blood pressure. NO generated by the neuronal isoform seems to have neurotransmitter function and the neuronal isoform is among other regulator processes involved in memory function (long term potentiation).<br><br>
In contrast to the constitutive isoforms the activation of inducible NO-synthase (iNOS, NOS-II), the sole member of the second class, is performed by transcriptional activation of the iNOS-promoter. Proinflammatory stimuli lead to transcription of the gene for inducible NO-synthase, which is catalytically active without increases in the intracellular Ca2+concentration. Due to the long half live of the inducible NO-synthase and the unregulated activity of the enzyme, high micromolar concentrations of NO are generated over longer time periods. These high NO-concentrations alone or in cooperation with other reactive radicals such as 02-are cytotoxic. Therefore, in situations of microbial infections, iNOS is involved in cell killing by macrophages and other immune cells during early nonspecific immune responses.<br>
There are a number of pathophysiological situations which among others are characterized by the high expression of inducible NO-synthase and concomitant high NO or 02-concentrations. It has been shown that these high NO concentrations alone or in combination with other radical species lead to tissue and organ damage and are causally involved in these pathophysiologies. As inflammation is characterized by the expression of proinflammatory enzymes, including inducible NO-synthase, acute and chronical inflammatory processes are promising diseases for the therapeutic application of selective inhibitors of inducible NO-synthase. Other pathophysiologies with high NO-production from inducible NO-synthase are several forms of shock (septic, hemorrhagic and cytokine-induced). It is clear that nonselective NO-synthase inhibitors will lead to cardiovascular and neuronal side effects due to concomitant inhibition of constitutive NO-synthase isoforms.<br>
It has been shown in in-vivo animal models of septic shock that reduction of circulating plasma NO- levels by NO-scavenger or inhibition of inducible NO-synthase restores systemic blood pressure, reduces organ damage and increases survival (deAngelo Exp. Opin. Pharmacother. 19-29,1999 ; Redl et au Shock 8, Suppl. 51,1997 ; Strand et al. Crit. Care Med. 26,1490-1499,1998). It has also been shown that increased NO production during septic shock contributes to cardiac depression and myocardial dysfunction (Sun et al. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 30,989-997, 1998). Furthermore there are also reports showing reduced infarct size after occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery in the presence of NO-synthase inhibitors (Wang et al. Am. J. Hyperttens. 12,174-182,1999). Considerable inducible NO-synthase activity is found in human cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, supporting the hypothesis that NO accounts at least in part for the dilatation and impaired contractility in these pathophysiologies (de Belder et al. Br. Heart. J. 4,426-430,1995).<br>
In animal models of acute or chronic inflammation, blockade of inducible NO-synthase by isoform-selective or nonselective inhibitors or genetic knock out improves therapeutic outcome. It is reported that experimental arthritis (Connor et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 273,15-24, 1995) and osteoarthritis (Pelletier et al. Arthritis &amp; Rheum. 41,1275-1286, 1998), experimental inflammations of the gastro- intestinal tract (Zingarelli et al. Gut 45,199-209,1999), experimental glomerulonephritis (Narita et al. Lab. Invest. 72, 17-24, 1995), experimental diabetes (Corbett et al. PNAS 90,8992-8995, 1993), LPS- induced experimental lung injury is reduced by inhibition<br><br><br>
of inducible NO-synthase or in iNOS-knock out mice (Kristof et al. Am. J. Crit. Care. Med. 158, 1883-1889, 1998). A pathophysiological role of inducible NO-synthase derived NO or O2 is also discussed in chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and COPD.<br>
Furthermore, in models of neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS such as MPTP-induced parkinsonism, amyloid peptide induced Alzheimer"s disease (Ishii et al., FASEB J. 14,1485-1489, 2000), malonate induced Huntington"s disease (Connop et al. Neuropharmacol. 35,459-465, 1996), experimental menengitis (Korytko &amp; Boje Neuropharmacol. 35,231-237, 1996) and experimental encephalitis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75,174-186,1997) a causal participation of NO and inducible NO-synthase has been shown.<br>
Increased iNOS expression has been found in the brains of AIDS victims and it is reasonable to assume a role of iNOS in AIDS related dementia (Bagasra et al. J. Neurovirol. 3 153-167,1997).<br>
Other studies implicated nitric oxide as a potential mediator of microglia dependent primary demyelination, a hallmark of multiple sklerosis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75,174-186,1997).<br>
An inflammatory reaction with concomitant expression of inducible NO-synthase also takes place during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (ladecola et al Stroke 27,1373-1380, 1996). Resulting NO together with 02-from infiltrating neutrophils is thought to be responsible for cellular and organ damage. Also, in models of traumatic brain injury (Mesenge et al. J. Neurotrauma 13,209-214, 1996; Wada et al. Neurosurgery 43, 1427-1436,1998) NO-synthase inhibitors have been show to posses protective properties. A regulatory role for inducible NO-synthase has been reported in various tumor cell lines (Tozer &amp; Everett Clin Oncol. 9.357-264,1997).<br>
On account of their inducible NO-synthase-inhibiting properties, the compounds according to the invention can be employed in human and veterinary medicine and therapeutics, where an excess of NO or 02-due to increases in the activity of inducible NO-synthase is involved.

For the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention are preferably also administered by inhalation in the form of an aerosol; the aerosol particles of solid, liquid or mixed composition preferably having a diameter of 0.5 to 10 urn, advantagously of 2 to 6 urn.<br>
Aerosol generation can be carried out, for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, but advantageously by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from inhalation capsules.<br>
Depending on the inhaler system used, in addition to the active compounds the administration forms additionally contain the required excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e. g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, fillers (e. g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds.<br>
For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparatuses are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is as right as possible for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler® or the inhaler described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321), using which an optimal administration of active compound can be achieved.<br>
For the treatment of dermatoses, the compounds according to the invention are in particular admi- nistered in the form of those pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for topical application. For the production of the pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are preferably mixed with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and further processed to give suitable pharmaceutical formulations. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations are, for example, powders, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, fatty ointments, creams, pastes, gels or solutions.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are prepared by processes known per se. The dosage of the active compounds is carried out in the order of magnitude customary for iNOS inhibitors. Topical application forms (such as ointments) for the treatment of dermatoses thus contain the active compounds in a concentration of, for example, 0.1-99%. The dose for administration by inhalation is customary between 0.1 and 10 mg per day. The customary dose in the case of systemic therapy (p.o.) is between 0.3 and 30 mg/kg per day, (i.v.) is between 0.3 and 30 mg/kg/h.<br>
Biological investigations<br>
Measurement of inducible NO-synthase activity<br>
The assay is perFormed in 96-well microliter F-plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, FRG) in a total volume of 100 ul in the presence of 100 nM calmodulin, 226 uM CaCl2, 477 uM MgCh, 5 uM flavin-adenine- dinucleotide (FAD), 5 uM flavin mononucleotide (FMN), 0.1 mM NADPH, 7 mM glutathione, 10 uM BH4 and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.2. Arginine concentrations are 0. 1 uM for enzyme inhibition experiments. 150000 dpm of [3H] arginine are added to the assay mixture. Enzyme reaction is started by the addition of 4 µg of a crude cytosolic fraction containing human inducible NO-synthase and the reaction mixture is incubated for 45 to 60 min at 37°C. Enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 10 ul of 2M MES-buffer pH 5,0. 50 ul of the incubation mixture are transferred into a MADP N65 filtration microtiter plate (Millipore, Eschborn, FRG) containing already 50 µl of AG-50W-X8 cation exchange resin (Biorad, Munchen, FRG). The resin in the Na loaded form is pre-equilibrated in water and 70 ul (corresponding to 50 ul dry beads) are pipette under heavy stirring with a 8 channel pipette into the filtration plate. After pipetting 50 ul of the enzyme reaction mixture onto the filtration plates, the plates are placed on a filtration manifold (Porvair, Shepperton, UK) and the flow through is collected in Pico scintillation plates (Packard, Meriden, CT). The resin in the filtration plates is washed with 75 ul of water (1x50 ul and lx 25 µl) which is also collected in the same plate as the sample. The total flow through of 125 ul is mixed with 175 ul of Microscint-40 scintillation cocktail (Packard) and the scintillation plate is sealed with TopSeal P-foil (Packard). Scintillation plates are counted in a szintillation counter.<br>
For the measurement of inducible NO-synthase-inhibiting potencies of compounds increasing concentrations of inhibitors were included into the incubation mixture. IC5o-values were calculated from the percent inhibition at given concentrations by nonlinear least square fitting.<br>
The inhibitory values determined for the compounds according to the invention follow from the following table A, in which the compound numbers correspond to the example numbers.<br><br>
