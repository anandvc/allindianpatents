				<td>This invention relates to the process for the preparation of molecularly imprinted polymers useful for separation of enzymes. Molecularly imprinted polymers prepared by the process of the present invention exhibit selective binding of imprinted enzyme which is useful in separating the imprinted enzyme from aqueous solution of the imprinted enzyme or a mixture containing imprinted enzyme and other enzymes.<br>
Purification and isolation of biological macroraolecules like proteins and<br>
enzymes are critical multi-step process that result in very low yields and thus a<br>
high cost. As a better alternative to the conventional processes, researchers have developed various techniques for purification of enzymes which can broadly be classified as follows.<br>
1.	Affinity chromatography (Y. Li, G.Kunyu, C.Lubai Z.Hanfa, Z.Yunkui Sepu,<br>
14, 415 (1996), T.Makriyannis, Y.D.Clonis, BiotecLBioengg. 53, 49 (1997)).<br>
2.	Affinity precipitation (C.Senstad, B.Mattiasscn.  Biiotech.Bioengg.  33, 216<br>
(1989),   M.Schneider,   C.Guillot,   B.Lamy,   AnnNlY.Acad.Sci.   369,   257<br>
(1981)).<br><br>
3.	Affinity crossflow ultrafiltration ( K.Sigmundsson, H.Filippusson, Polyimer int.<br>
41, 355 (1996), T.B.Choe, P.Masse, A.Verdier, Biotech.Lett. 8, 163 (19S6)).<br>
4.	Affinity partitioning ( G.Takerkart, E.Segard, M.Monsigny, FEBS Dett. 42,<br>
218 (1972), B.A.Andrews, D.M.Head, P.Dunthorne, J.A.Asenjo, Biotscih.Tech.<br>
4, 49 (1990)).<br>
5.	Immobilized   metal   affinity   chromatography   (   G.Ehteshami.   J.Porath,<br>
»<br>
R.Guzman,  G.Ehteshami, J.Mol.Recognit.  9, 733   (1996),  A.L.BIonnkalns, M.R.Gomez, Prep.Biochem.Biotechnol. 27, 219 (1997)).<br>
6.	Molecularly    imprinted    immobilized    metal     affinity    chromarography<br>
(F.H.Arnold, P.Dhal, D.Shnek, S.Plunkett, US patent 5,310,648 (1994))..<br>
These techniques exploit either the binding interaction between actiive site<br>
of enzyme and its inhibitor i.e. affinity monomer or between surface histidine,<br>
tyrosine, cysteine groups of enzymes with metal ions immobilized on a suipport. But these techniques also suffer from one or other disadvantages as follows.<br>
Affinity chromatography uses a column containing an inhibitor or a dye or an antibody for a given enzyme for its separation from a mixture of enzymes. The solution of enzymes is poured over the affinity column to retain the desired enzyme on column for subsequent isolation. This technique is efficient omly for<br><br>
small capacity columns. With the scale up of columns, the problems of sample pretreatment and plugging of packed column become severe.<br>
Affinity precipitation technique needs a complex to be formed between a<br>
macro-ligand and a protein both containing multiple binding sites. When such a<br>
•i<br>
complex is formed, it precipitates. Thus, this technique is restricted mainly for multimeric proteins. Beside such macro-ligands are often costly. Therefore, certain synthetic inhibitors or dyes are linked to stimuli responsive polymer which can be precipitated by pH or temperature stimuli after it forms complex with the enzyme. In this case along with the desired enzyme, a substantial amount of other enzymes bind to the polymer by means of nonspecific adsorption.<br>
In case of affinity crossflow ultrafiltration, a solution of enzymes is filtered through a membrane containing affinity group under pressure. This technique is suitable in the cases where difference between molecular weights of two enzymes is high. Also, with increase in the filtration time, denaturation of enzymes as well as clogging of membrane takes place due to the pressure applied.<br>
Affinity partitioning  of two- phase  aqueous  systems  is  widely used technique as compared to those mentioned above, hi this technique concentrated<br><br>
aqueous solution of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) with or without linking affinity group is mixed with enzyme solution containing moderate to high salt concentration. The two phases are mixed well and allowed to separate. Enzyme gets predominantly partitioned in one phase, which subsequently can be isolated Disadvantages of this technique are nonspecific extraction of other protenacious molecules along with desired enzyme and also poor interactions between enzyme and affinity group due to high ionic strength.<br>
Immobilized metal affinity chromatography is a technique in which columns of polymeric support containing chelated metal ions are used. These metal ions form coordination complex with histidine, tyrosine, cysteine etc. present on the surface of the enzyme. Although this technique has advantages like high column capacity, ease in the enzyme elution etc. it is not very selective in descriminating between two closely related (with respect to their amino acid sequences) enzymes.<br>
Molecular imprinting of matrices containing metal chelates is a recently developed technique, which increases the selectivity (F.H.Amold, P.Dhal, D.Shnek, S.Plunkett, US patent 5,310,648 (1994)). In this technique complex of monomer containing chelated metal ion and enzyme is polymerized with crosslinker in order to imprint the polymer with enzyme. Although this technique<br><br>
exhibits a substantial selectivity, it is not as selective as that of biological antibodies or active site inhibitor of enzymes.<br>
Synthetic inhibitors are molecules which exhibit affinity to the active site of a given enzyme. This interaction is very specific for a given pair of enzyme and inhibitor and such inhibitors bind very strongly to a given enzyme.<br>
Molecular imprinting is a simple technique which allows synthesis of polymers capable of recognizing specific molecules. These polymers are stable and can withstand harsh conditions such as temperature and pH etc ( G.Wulff, Molecular interactions in bioseparations Ed. by T.T.Ngo, Plenum press, N.Y. (1993)). Thus these polymers are finding wide range of applications. A polymer containing monomer based on enzyme inhibitor Le. affinity monomer which is also imprinted for corresponding enzyme is expected to exhibit a high selectivity as well as high capacity for binding a specific enzyme. This synergistic affinity -imprinting effect will not be available in the above mentioned techniques. Such affinity- imprinted polymers have not been reported so far.<br>

hereinafter.)<br>
In still another embodiment, crosslinker may be selected from  compounds such as methylene bisacrylamide, N, N diacryloyl 1,2 diaminoethane. N, N dimethacryloyl 1,2 diaminoethane N, N diacryloyl 1,6 diaminohexane. ethylene glycol dimethacryalte and the like.<br>

In a feature of the present invention, the molecularly imprinted polymer is typically prepared under mild conditions as follows. Affinity monomer and its respective enzyme are dissolved in water and stirred for 15 to 30 minutes at room temperature to form the enzyme-affinity monomer complex. Then comonomer, crosslinker and polymerization initiator are added to the solution containing enzyme-affinity monomer complex and the solution is purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes. Polymerization accelerator is then added and the solution is kept at 37 ° C for 18 hours for polymerization. The crosslinked polymer so obtained is treated with acetone to remove water and crushed to small particles. Template enzyme is extracted from the particles by 3 to 4 alternative treatments of the solvent which breaks the complex between enzyme and the inhibitor. Polymer particles are then<br><br>
sieved and used for enzyme separations.<br>
