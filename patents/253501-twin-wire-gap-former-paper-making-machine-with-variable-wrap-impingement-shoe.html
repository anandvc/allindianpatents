				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention concerns a twin fabric gap blade type forming section of a<br>
papermaking machine and an apparatus for improving sheet formation therein.<br>
The modern two fabric (or twin wire) papermaking machines in which the<br>
papermaking stock or furnish is delivered from the headbox slice lip into the gap between two<br>
converging forming fabrics is often referred to as a gap former. In a gap former, one of the<br>
two forming fabrics is supported either by wrapping it around a rotating roll surface, or by<br>
wrapping it over the fabric support surfaces comprised of a series of blades mounted on a<br>
supporting stationary shoe. There are two types of gap formers.<br>
In the first type of gap former, referred to as a gap roll former, initial impingement of<br>
the stock jet is onto a fabric supported on a roll surface; this arrangement provides for<br>
constant pressure drainage, with excellent fiber retention, excellent tolerance to impingement<br>
angle variations, but poor sheet formation due to the absence of the beneficial pressure<br>
pulses provided by blade edges.<br>
In the second type of gap former, known as a gap blade former, the initial<br>
impingement of the stock jet is onto a fabric which is supported by a series of blade surfaces.<br>
The strong pressure pulses generated by fabric deflection at the edges of each blade surface<br>
results in excellent sheet formation, but poor fiber retention and an almost zero tolerance for<br>
variations in the angle of impingement of the stock jet from the headbox slice.<br>
Recent advances in two fabric forming technology have included the introduction of<br>
stationary curved impingement shoe technology, for example, as shown in US 2003/0173048<br>
to Buchanan et al. The stationary curved impingement shoe, which is partially wrapped by<br>
both fabrics, replaces the roll or blade impingement zones described above. The curved<br>
impingement shoe provides an impingement zone that dewaters the sheet in a manner<br>
similar to that obtained with a curved roll surface as in the gap roll former, but combined with<br>
a series of much gentler pressure pulses than are possible with the traditional bladed<br>
stationary shoe as in the gap blade former. In gap formers equipped with the stationary<br>
curved impingement shoe such as those described in the present invention, a fabric lead-in<br>
roll is present immediately upstream to the impingement shoe.<br>
Following the initial impingement zone in any of these aforementioned roll, blade or<br>
impingement type gap former arrangements, the two forming fabrics together with the<br>
papermaking furnish sandwiched between them pass over a stationary bladed forming shoe<br>
for further dewatering and formation enhancing pressure pulses provided by the blade<br>
2<br><br>
edges. This formation shoe is most often placed on the inside run of the opposite fabric to<br>
that on which the impingement occurs to provide for a balancing of the drainage. It is also<br>
known to use adjustable pressurized blades that can be loaded by means of hydraulic or air<br>
pressure so as to push them into the fabrics, such as are described by US 6,361,657, that<br>
are mounted opposite the stationary bladed forming shoe so that the individual pressurized<br>
blades can press into the two fabrics (with the stock sandwiched between them) in the gaps<br>
between the stationary blades on the forming shoe.<br>
The adjustable pressurized blades provide a further degree of adjustment and control<br>
over the magnitude of the pressure pulses occurring at each stationary blade edge. These<br>
adjustable blades are capable of providing dramatic improvements in sheet quality, but only if<br>
the sheet consistency entering this portion of the forming section is within a very narrow<br>
range that permits beneficial fiber realignment. If the consistency is too high or too low, then<br>
the use of these blades can be detrimental to sheet quality, rather than providing an<br>
improvement.<br>
The consistency of the embryonic sheet entering the opposed blade section is<br>
determined by many factors, including: basis weight of the product being manufactured,<br>
consistency of the stock exiting the headbox slice, composition of the stock and, most<br>
importantly, the amount of drainage occurring in the initial impingement zone. The drainage<br>
occurring in the initial impingement zone, whether it be in a gap roll, gap blade or curved<br>
impingement shoe forming arrangement, is also dependant on the above mentioned factors<br>
as well as the fabric tension and the angle of wrap (i.e. the amount of the curved surface<br>
over which the two fabrics wrap in the impingement zone). It is well known that the angle of<br>
wrap in the impingement zone is fixed by machine geometry and therefore the consistency<br>
entering the opposed blade section will change if any of the operational variables fluctuate,<br>
and consequently paper quality will suffer.<br>
The headbox is a massive object and, although so-called slice lips are provided which<br>
may be used to direct the stream of stock being ejected from the headbox onto a desired<br>
location on the impingement shoe, fine control of these lips is imprecise and cumbersome. It<br>
is very difficult in practice to precisely direct the stock jet onto the impingement shoe so that it<br>
impacts at a specific location with precision.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,523,978 discloses the use of a forming shoe in a twin wire former. The<br>
forming shoe is located downstream of the initial single wire portion of the forming section so<br>
that it only acts after some degree of felting of the embryonic paper web has taken place and<br>
the fibers are no longer able to move relative to each other. The position or attitude of the<br>
3<br><br>
forming shoe is adjustable in order to adjust the dewatering capability of the forming section<br>
as well as web formation. This arrangement is not indicated as effecting fiber distribution in<br>
the embryonic paper web.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Briefly stated, the present invention is directed to an improved forming section of the<br>
type in which the stock jet is delivered from a headbox slice onto a first of a pair of moving<br>
forming fabrics at a location where the first fabric (known as the conveying fabric) passes in<br>
sliding contact over an impingement shoe. The impingement shoe is followed by a forming<br>
shoe upon which are mounted a plurality of fixed formation blades. Preferably, an opposing<br>
blade unit is provided with a plurality of resiliently mounted formation blades located opposite<br>
the forming shoe so that the blades are positioned in between the blades of the forming shoe<br>
and press into the fabrics to provide a series of pressure pulses which provide energy to<br>
randomize fiber distribution and improve sheet formation. Opposing blade units are<br>
preferable for most, but not all, paper grades. At least one of the impingement shoe and the<br>
forming shoe, and more preferably both the impingement shoe and forming shoe, are<br>
mounted in an adjustable manner. This allows the effective drainage length of the stock<br>
sandwiched between the forming fabrics at the impingement shoe, and thus a consistency of<br>
the stock, to be adjusted prior to the formation shoe based on the effective wrap angle, and<br>
also allows the fabric deflection angle of the forming fabrics between the impingement shoe<br>
and the formation shoe to be adjusted to prevent overstressing and damage to the<br>
embryonic web being formed as it is carried to the formation shoe.<br>
Through the ability to adjust a position of the impingement shoe and/or formation<br>
shoe in a quick and efficient manner, stock consistency can be optimized so as to maximize<br>
the benefit obtained from the pressure pulses provided by the impingement and formation<br>
shoes. This allows the papermaking machine to efficiently produce a wider variety of paper<br>
products with a shorter turnaround time than has hitherto been possible.<br>
The invention is based, in part, on the determination that the consistency of the stock<br>
entering the forming section can be controlled by altering the location of the point of<br>
impingement of the stock jet onto the forming fabric which wraps the curved impingement<br>
shoe. This changes the effective drainage length without having to move the headbox<br>
structure. Unlike the roll former with its fixed structure, the impingement point of the stock jet<br>
on the impingement shoe in a gap former can be moved according to the invention by<br>
4<br><br>
combining a very small but controlled amount of rotation and/or linear movement of the<br>
impingement shoe while leaving the trajectory of the headbox jet unchanged. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, a pivot point is provided for the impingement shoe and is located<br>
such that the fabric path between the trailing edge of the impingement shoe and the leading<br>
edge of the formation shoe remains in approximately the same position, while the lower<br>
(upstream) portion of the curved impingement shoe is caused to rotate so that the jet<br>
impinges further downstream onto the impingement shoe, thus reducing the effective<br>
drainage length.<br>
The lead-in roll is preferably also moved in a linked manner with the impingement<br>
shoe as an assembly to ensure that the position of the front edge of the shoe remains<br>
constant relative to the lead-in roll.<br>
Additionally, an effective wrap angle of the sandwiched forming fabrics with the stock<br>
located therebetween about the impingement shoe can be increased, maintained or<br>
diminished in a precisely controlled fashion during normal operation of the papermaking<br>
machine so as to provide more or less dewatering for adjustment to various sheet properties.<br>
These features of the invention allow the consistency of the stock entering the<br>
opposing blade portion of the forming section to be more precisely controlled than has<br>
previously been possible by altering the location of the point of impingement of the stock jet,<br>
thereby changing the effective drainage length of the stock and forming fabrics over the<br>
impingement and forming shoes, without having to move the huge headbox structure. By<br>
using the features of the present invention, it is now possible to quickly and efficiently alter<br>
the position of the impingement point of the stock jet on the impingement shoe. This is<br>
accomplished by imparting a very small, but precisely controlled amount of movement, such<br>
as by rotation and/or linear movement to either the impingement shoe, the forming shoe, or<br>
both the impingement and forming shoe, while leaving the trajectory of the headbox jet<br>
unchanged.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, the downstream forming shoe assembly<br>
is also moveable, preferably by incorporating another pivot point and/or transverse<br>
adjustment, which would allow for movement by rotation or transverse adjustment at a<br>
position immediately downstream of the impingement shoe. This assists in controlling a<br>
fabric deflection angle of the forming fabrics as they pass from the impingement shoe to the<br>
forming shoe in instances where the position of the fabrics at the trailing edge of the<br>
impingement shoe require adjustment to optimize paper formation properties.<br>
5<br><br>
In one embodiment, both the impingement shoe and the forming shoe are moved<br>
cooperatively so as to provide the necessary adjustments to formation properties, if<br>
necessary. Alternatively, the impingement shoe and the forming shoe are moved<br>
independently using separate controls or adjustments.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the forming shoe is linked to the impingement shoe<br>
by a linkage arrangement or via logic programmed into one or more controllers so that<br>
movements of the impingement shoe provide cooperative movements of the forming shoe.<br>

at the trailing edge of the impingement shoe and/or the leading edge of the forming shoe.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, a forming section 10 for a gap blade former type<br>
papermaking machine is shown. The forming section 10 includes a head box 12 which<br>
delivers a jet of papermaking stock 14 toward a point of impingement 16 on a conveying<br>
forming fabric 18. A backing forming fabric 20 is also provided and converges with the<br>
conveying forming fabric 18 at or very near to the point of impingement. The fabrics 18, 20<br>
are each mounted for advancing movement in the direction of arrows 22, 24 and have facing<br>
advancing sides between which the embryonic paper web is formed from the papermaking<br>
stock. Both fabrics 18, 20 are wrapped around lead-in rolls 26, 28 located immediately<br>
downstream of the head box 12. The conveying fabric 18 is carried over an impingement<br>
shoe 30 over which it moves in sliding contact. The jet 14 of papermaking stock is delivered<br>
at the point of impingement 16 at a position over the impingement shoe 30, between the<br>
forming fabrics 18, 20.<br>
A forming shoe 40 is located immediately downstream of the impingement shoe 30.<br>
The backing forming fabric 20 slides over the forming shoe 40 to further distribute fibers in<br>
the papermaking stock and dewater the web. The two forming fabrics 18, 20 with the<br>
embryonic paper web sandwiched therebetween preferably encounter a series of blade<br>
edges 42 on the forming shoe which create pressure pulses to enhance dewatering. An<br>
oppositely mounted series of adjustable pressurized blades 50 are preferably also provided<br>
and can be loaded by means of hydraulic or air pressure so as to push them into the fabrics<br>
7<br><br>
18, 20, as described in U.S. Patent 6,361,657, which is incorporated herein by reference as if<br>
fully set forth.<br>
According to the invention, the impingement shoe 30 is mounted for at least one of<br>
pivoting and transverse (left-right) movement so that a position of the point of impingement<br>
16 of the jet of papermaking stock 14 on the conveying fabric 18 in an area of sliding contact<br>
over the impingement shoe 30 is adjustable by at least one of rotating the impingement shoe<br>
30 about a first pivot point 32 and transversely shifting the impingement shoe 30. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 1, the impingement shoe 30 is pivotally mounted about the<br>
pivot point 32 and supported by a mounting arrangement 34. An actuator 36 is provided<br>
which can be used to pivot the impingement shoe 30 about the pivot point 32. The actuator<br>
36 may be mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrically driven, and may be manually<br>
adjusted or more preferably controlled via a controller (not shown) to allow for pivoting<br>
adjustment of a position of the impingement shoe 30 in order to adjust the point of<br>
impingement 16 and maintain it in a desired position, depending upon the particular<br>
requirements of the papermaking stock being utilized.<br>
The lead-in roll 18 is preferably linked to the impingement shoe 30 so that<br>
adjustments in the position of the impingement shoe 30 provide corresponding adjustments<br>
to a position of the lead-in roll in order to maintain a desired lead-in angle for the conveying<br>
fabric 18 to the leading edge of the impingement shoe 30.<br>
Still with reference to Figure 1, the forming shoe 40 is preferably mounted for at least<br>
one of pivoting and transverse movement. This allows a position of at least a leading edge<br>
of the forming shoe 40 to be adjustable by at least one of rotating of the forming shoe 40<br>
about a second pivot point 44 and transversely shifting the forming shoe, as explained in<br>
further detail below, in order to adjust a wrap angle of the conveying fabric 18 and the<br>
backing fabric 20. The second pivot point 44 is preferably located at or near a downstream<br>
side of the forming shoe 40 so that pivoting movement has little effect on a trailing edge<br>
position of the fabrics 18, 20 as they exit the forming shoe 40. However, the leading edge of<br>
the forming shoe 40 can be adjusted as required in order to maintain a low fabric deflection<br>
angle of the fabrics 18, 20 as they transition from the impingement shoe 30 to the forming<br>
shoe 40, in order to prevent a high shear from being transmitted to the fibers of the<br>
papermaking stock, which can cause formation defects.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the forming shoe 40 is linked to the impingement shoe 30<br>
such that movement of the impingement shoe 30 provides a corresponding movement of the<br>
forming shoe 40. This is preferably accomplished via a linkage 46 which is connected to the<br>
8<br><br>
impingement shoe 30 and causes movement of the forming shoe 40 as well as the structure<br>
for supporting the oppositely mounted series of adjustable pressurized blades 50. This can<br>
be in the form of a simple linkage 46 or, if necessary, a more complex linkage may be<br>
provided to provide a desired movement characteristic between the trailing edge of the<br>
impingement shoe 30 and the leading edge of the forming shoe 40.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, a second embodiment of a forming section 110 in<br>
accordance with the present invention is shown. The forming section 110 is similar to the<br>
forming section 10 and includes the conveying fabric 18 and backing fabric 20 which travel in<br>
the advancing direction 22, 24 on lead-in rollers 26, 28. The jet of stock 14 from the head<br>
box 12 contacts the impingement shoe on 130 at an impingement point 116. The forming<br>
shoe 140 is mounted for at least one of pivoting and transverse movement so that a fabric<br>
deflection angle of the fabrics 18, 20 in an area between a trailing edge of the impingement<br>
shoe 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 140 is adjusted by at least one of rotating<br>
the forming shoe 140 about a first pivot point 144 and transversely shifting the forming shoe<br>
140. Pivoting movement is preferably accomplished via an actuator 148 which may be a<br>
hydraulic, mechanical, pneumatic or electrically driven actuator which is utilized to adjust a<br>
leading edge position of the forming shoe on 140 by tilting up or down. The forming shoe<br>
140 may also be mounted for transverse (left-right) movement on a support structure 152<br>
which includes an actuator 154 that can be used to transversely shift a position of the pivot<br>
point 144. This can be utilized to adjust a gap between the trailing edge of the impingement<br>
shoe 130 and the leading edge of the forming shoe 140. Preferably, the actuators 148 and<br>
154 are controlled via a controller in order to allow precise movement of the forming shoe<br>
140 to a desired position depending upon the type and consistency of the papermaking stock<br>
and the type of paper being made.<br>
The impingement shoe 130 is preferably also mounted for a pivoting movement about<br>
the first pivot point 132 which is controlled via actuator 136. The first pivot point 132 can also<br>
be transversely shifted via actuator 139. The actuators 136 and 139 are preferably also<br>
controlled via the controller to allow a desired position and holding of the impingement shoe<br>
130 at a desired angle so that a desired impingement point 116 and effective wrap angle can<br>
be achieved. The controller may provide a logical linkage between movement of the<br>
impingement shoe 130 and the forming shoe 140 based upon control signals to one or more<br>
of the actuators 136, 139, 148 and 154 to provide a linked movement between the<br>
impingement shoe 130 and the forming shoe 140.<br>
9<br><br>
Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, the adjustment of the impingement shoe 30, 130<br>
will be explained in detail. In Figure 3, the impingement shoe 30 is shown with an effective<br>
wrap angle between the sandwiched fabrics 18, 20 and the impingement shoe 30, 130 of<br>
about 8.5°, with the point of impingement 16 being located at about a medial position on the<br>
impingement shoe 30, 130. This results in a shorter effective drainage length on the surface<br>
of the impingement shoe 30, 130 starting from the impingement point 16, 116 and ending at<br>
the trailing edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130. Depending upon a consistency of the<br>
stock and the type of paper being manufactured, it may be desirable to remove additional<br>
water from the stock provided by the jet 14 prior to the fabrics 18, 20 leaving the trailing edge<br>
of the impingement shoe 30, 130 and contacting the leading blade 42 of the forming shoe 40,<br>
140. In order to increase the dewatering effect of the impingement shoe 30, 130, it is<br>
preferably rotated about the first pivot point 32, as shown in Figure 4. This adjustment of the<br>
impingement shoe 30, 130 by rotation about the pivot point 32 changes the impingement<br>
point to a point 16', 116' closer to a leading edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130. In the<br>
example shown, the effective wrap angle of the fabrics 18, 20 along the impingement shoe is<br>
changed to 13.5° by rotation of the impingement shoe 30, 130 in a counter clockwise manner<br>
which also results in the impingement point 16', 116' of the jet on the impingement shoe 30,<br>
130 to be closer to a leading edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130. Preferably, the lead-in<br>
roll 26 is rotated with the impingement shoe so that an angle of the conveying fabric 18 at the<br>
leading edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130 does not change.<br>
In order to ensure that the embryonic paper web formed between the backing and<br>
conveying fabrics 18, 20 is not damaged due to too high or too low of a wrap angle between<br>
the trailing edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130 and the leading edge of the forming shoe<br>
40, 140, the forming shoe 40, 140 can be moved in connection with an adjustment of the<br>
position of the impingement shoe 30, 130. This can be done separately, or through a linked<br>
or controlled movement of both the forming shoe 30, 130 and impingement shoe 40, 140<br>
which can be accomplished via a mechanical linkage, such as the mechanical link 46 shown<br>
in Figure 1, or via a control logic linkage through the use of separate actuators controlling at<br>
least one of a rotation angle position of the forming shoe 40, 140, such as via the actuator<br>
148 shown in Figure 2. Additionally, a distance between the trailing edge of the impingement<br>
shoe 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 140 can be adjusted, for example via a<br>
transverse motion controlled by an actuator, such as actuator 139 or 154. This allows<br>
precise positioning of the impingement point of the jet 14 of papermaking stock on the<br>
impingement shoe 30, 130 to provide for the desired drainage by the impingement shoe, as<br>
10<br><br>
well as allowing for adjustment of the gap and fabric deflection angle between a trailing edge<br>
of the impingement shoe 30, 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 40, 140, described<br>
in further detail below.<br>
Preferably, the range of motion of the leading edge of the impingement shoe to obtain<br>
beneficial effects on the stock is in the range of from about 0.5mm to about 5mm in normal<br>
operation, depending on grade of product being made by the paper machine. Heavier basis<br>
weights will have a thicker fabric-slurry-fabric sandwich. In extreme cases of basis weight<br>
changes, it may necessary to move the leading edge of the impingement shoe up to about<br>
10mm or more although movement in the range of up to 15mm may be necessary depending<br>
on the papermaking variables.<br>
Similarly, movement of the leading edge of the forming shoe should normally be in<br>
the range of from about 0.5mm to about 5mm, but may include movement of the leading<br>
edge by as much as 20mm.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5 and 5a, a view of the jet 14 of papermaking stock at the<br>
impingement point 16 on the impingement shoe 30 is shown. Based on the consistency of<br>
the stock and the amount of dewatering to be carried out by the impingement shoe 30, the<br>
thickness of the sandwich created by the backing fabric 20, the conveying fabric 18 and the<br>
papermaking stock trapped between the fabrics, the fabric deflection angle between a trailing<br>
edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 40, 140 is set<br>
so that there is a low deflection angle (of about 0.5°) which prevents high shear which can<br>
result in crushing of the fibers and potential damage to the embryonic web being formed from<br>
the papermaking stock. Additionally, if a deflection angle is too low, this would result in the<br>
sandwich not being pressed firmly together, also potentially resulting in damage to the<br>
embryonic paper web.<br>
Figures 6 and 6a show the impingement shoe 30, 130 and the forming shoe 40, 140<br>
in the same locations as in Figures 5 and 5a after a change to a different grade of paper. A<br>
thicker paper making stock is provided by the jet 14'. Due to the increased thickness of the<br>
stock, the overall thickness of the sandwich formed by the conveying fabric 18, backing fabric<br>
20 and the furnish trapped between the fabrics 18, 20 at a point between the trailing edge of<br>
the impingement shoe 30, 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 40, 140 creates a<br>
greater deflection angle than is desirable. This can result in damage to the embryonic web of<br>
paper being formed.<br>
Referring to Figures 7 and 7a, this is easily corrected according to the present<br>
invention by at least one of moving the impingement shoe 30, 130 by pivoting and/or<br>
11<br><br>
transverse movement as well as the forming shoe 40, 140 by pivoting and/or transverse<br>
movement in order to reduce the fabric deflection angle of the conveying fabric 18, backing<br>
fabric 20 and the stock trapped therebetween at a position between a trailing edge of the<br>
impingement shoe 30, 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 40, 140.<br>
It is noted that a thickness of the sandwiched fabrics 18, 20 and papermaking stock<br>
can be adjusted by a number of factors, including changing the impingement point 16 on the<br>
impingement shoe 30, 130 and the effective wrap angle. For example, for a thicker stock,<br>
providing an impingement point 16 closer to a leading edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130<br>
with a greater wrap angle would result in more drainage being carried out on the<br>
impingement shoe 30, 130 and result in a reduced sandwiched thickness. However, for a<br>
thin stock, in order to maintain a proper tension and fabric deflection angle between a trailing<br>
edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 40, 140, it<br>
may be desirable to have less drainage carried out on the impingement shoe 30, 130.<br>
Therefore it could be desirable to adjust the impingement point 16 to a position closer to the<br>
trailing edge of the impingement shoe 30, 130, for example as shown in Figure 3.<br>
According to the invention, adjustments in a location of the impingement point 16 on<br>
the impingement shoe 30, 130 as well as the fabric deflection angle between the trailing<br>
edge of the impingement shoe 30,130 and a leading edge of the forming shoe 40, 140 can<br>
be easily adjusted via one or more of the actuators 36, 136, 139, 148 and 154, preferably<br>
using a controller for easy adjustment during changeovers to mill runs of different types of<br>
paper. This used to entail a laborious process of shutting down the equipment and manually<br>
adjusting the impingement and/or forming shoe locations prior to restarting the equipment.<br>
Only when the equipment was restarted would it be possible to determine whether the proper<br>
adjustment had been made. In accordance with the invention, the moveable impingement<br>
shoe 30, 130 and/or forming shoe 40, 140 can both be easily moved to adjust the forming<br>
section for forming different types of paper webs. This can be carried out prior to or during<br>
operation of the papermaking machine allowing for minute adjustments on the fly in order to<br>
improve the quality of the paper web being formed. The result is that the papermaking<br>
machine can efficiently produce a wider variety of paper products with a shorter turnaround<br>
time than has hitherto been possible.<br>
A variety of mechanisms are available which will impart sufficient accurate movement<br>
(rotational and/or linear) of the leading edge of either or both the impingement shoe and<br>
forming shoe. Selection of any one of these will be dictated by machine design and layout<br>
(the mechanism should not interfere with any other units, showers, pans or mountings) as<br>
12<br><br>
well as papermaking conditions and customer requirements. The actual mechanism may<br>
include a simple single pivot arrangement, a double sliding mechanism, where each end is<br>
moved linearly along a fixed path, or a combination of both, or other suitable arrangements.<br>
Rotational movement can be provided by a drive actuator, such as a cross shaft and screw<br>
jack arrangement driven by an electric motor. Alternatively, hydraulic or pneumatic actuators<br>
or drives could be utilized.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize from the present disclosure that some or all of<br>
the benefits of the invention can be obtained by utilizing a movable impingement shoe, a<br>
movable forming shoe, or both.<br>
It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes can be made to the<br>
above-described embodiments of the invention without departing from the broad inventive<br>
process thereof which provides an impingement shoe and/or a forming shoe which can be<br>
moved, either independently or in a linked manner, in order to allow adjustments to both the<br>
impingement point of the jet of papermaking stock and the effective wrap angle, as well as<br>
the fabric deflection angle between a trailing edge of the impingement shoe and a leading<br>
edge of the forming shoe in order to provide improved paper web formation. It is understood<br>
therefore that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is<br>
intended to cover all modifications which are within the spirit and scope of the invention as<br>
defined by the appended claims.<br>
