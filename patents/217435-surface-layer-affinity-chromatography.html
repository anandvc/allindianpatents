				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Immuno-chromatography is currently performed in two major formats. The first is<br>
performed within gels when development is achieved by passive diffusion or is<br>
electrochemically induced, and the second is performed in flow. In the former using gels,<br>
radial immunodiffusion is the most commonly used system with a preformed gel often<br>
located within a circular plate in which a central well is present in the gel together with<br>
additional wells located around the edge of the gel. Antiserum or antigen is placed in the<br>
central well and antigen or antiserum is placed in the peripheral wells. Passive diffusion<br>
occurs within the gel and white bands of immunocomplex are seen within the gel due to<br>
antibody-antigen complex formation. In the electrochemical system antibody/antigen<br>
migration within the gel is induced using an electric current.<br>
In the flow-based systems the antibody or antigen is often immobilised within a cartridge<br>
which is paced with a liquid flow system such as a flow injection analysis system. The<br>
complementary antigen or antibody is injected and flows through the cartridge where<br>
specific interactions take place. Often the component that is injected carries a label that<br>
can be detected downstream, thereby producing a signal. Alternatively flow occurs over a<br>
planar surface as in lateral flow diffusion immunoassay systems where flow is induced by<br>
membrane wetting/capillarity.<br>
In the new format the equivalent immunoreactions take place in flow between an<br>
immobilised component and one in solution as above but this now occurs on the surface of<br>
a dip strip residing within a buffer solution. In this case flow across the surface of the strip<br>
occurs due to the higher density of a solution containing one of the immunoreagents that is<br>
initially present at the top of the strip that is itself standing in the buffer solution. Since the<br>
strip is nearly up right this denser solution slowly rolls down the surface of the strip<br>
presenting the reagent in the flowing phase to the immobilised reagent on the surface of<br>
the dip strip.<br>
Thus according to the invention we provide an affinity-chromatography assay system<br>
comprising with an immobilised component containing a bio-reagent and a flowable<br>
component containing a complimentary bio-reagent characterised in that the immobilised<br>
component is supported on a dip strip or other planar surface and the flowable component<br>
of high density is adapted to flow down the dip strip.<br>
In order for this phenomenon to work certain criteria must be met. Firstly the denser<br>
solution must be retained in a discrete volume as it passes as a layer over the surface rather<br>
than rapidly diffusing into the bulk of the buffer solution. Secondly the dip strip must<br>
possess certain properties that result in attraction of the rolling surface layer again leading<br>
to retention of the integrity of this mobile phase. To achieve the first criterion we have<br>
carefully chosen the constituents of the rolling phase to include a polymeric agent such as<br>
a protein and/or a polysaccharide, a detergent and a buffer of optimal pH, and for the<br>
second we use a membrane that is both hydrophobic and wettable.<br>
The system can be used as an immuno-chromatography system and assays performed in<br>
either competitive or non-competitive immunoassay formats. In the former the<br>
immobilised spot is either antibody or antigen. For immobilised antibody, a labelled<br>
antigen is deposited in a band above the spot in a cellulose square. A drop of sample<br>
containing the antigen is added to this square and after a suitable interval (1-10 min) the<br>
whole strip is immersed in a buffer solution. The dense mixture of labelled and unlabelled<br>
antigen flows over the spot of antibody and competition for binding takes place. If the<br>
antigen is immobilised at the spot, a labelled antibody replaces the labelled antigen in the<br>
cellulose square and the assay proceeds as before.<br>
The system can also be performed in a non-competitive immunoassay format when a spot<br>
of capture antibody is immobilised on the strip. Labelled antibody, is deposited on the<br>
cellulose square above the first spot. The strip is placed in the sample solution containing<br>
the antigen so that the upper square is immersed. Incubation now takes place during which<br>
antigen in the solution is captured by immobilised antibody on the spot. At the same time<br>
the labelled antibody is reconstituted in a dense solution that flows over the spot after<br>
about 5-10 minutes following insertion of the strip into the sample solution. This time lag<br>
enables antigen molecules to be captured on the spot prior to arrival of the surface layer<br>
containing the labelled antibody. This second antibody labels the captured antigen on the<br>
spot"s surface.<br>
In addition any label can be used. If a fluorescent or coloured label is used with the<br>
antibody or antigen, then a fluorescent or coloured spot will result following the first<br>
incubation, making the assay a single step system.<br>
If an enzyme label is used then a modified sequence of steps can be used in the non-<br>
competitive assay, In this, enzyme-labelled antibody is now added to the cellulose square<br>
attached to the bottom of the strip beneath the spot of immobilised capture antibody. A<br>
second cellulose square is also attached as before above this spot but this contains a dried<br>
solution of substrate for the enzyme plus a biopolymer such as dextran. The strip is placed<br>
in a limited volume of sample as before so as not to wet the upper cellulose square. The<br>
dense reconstituted solution of labelled antibody flows to the bottom of the container and<br>
stays there as a separate layer. At the same time antigen in solution is captured by the<br>
antibody on the spot. At the end of this incubation step (5-10 minutes) the solution is<br>
stirred using the dip strip. This causes the labelled antibody to be homogeneously<br>
distributed within the solution and the antibody can now bind to the captured antigen on<br>
the spot. Finally the volume in the container is increased to wet the upper cellulose square.<br>
The substrate is now reconstituted as a dense solution that flows over the spot when<br>
substrate to product conversion takes place resulting in a coloured spot.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention we provide a method of conducting<br>
immuno-chromatography assays  which comprise  the  use of an  assay  system  as<br>
hereinbefore described.<br>
This new surface layer chromatography phenomenon could, in theory, also be used as a<br>
generic method for separation of analyte mixtures if the components have<br>
different binding affinities for the surface. For example, it is well known that biological<br>
polymers such as proteins and as this is used in DNA-and protein -blotting follwing<br>
and protein-blotting following electrophoresis. We have also observed that for antibodies<br>
the rate of binding to this surface is pH sensitive [1]. Hence it should be possible to<br>
introduce a mixture of biological polymers onto a cellulose strip above a cellulose nitrate<br>
square. The pH and density of the buffer used would be such that surface layer<br>
chromatography will ensue when the strip is immersed into a second buffer solution<br>
chosen to optimise the binding of the biopolymers to the surface. Under these conditions,<br>
different binding interactions will take place between the bio-molecules and the surface as<br>
the mobile phase layer rolls over the surface. This should lead to separation of the<br>
components during this development phase. The strip would then be removed and the<br>
membrane treated to visualise, using established methods, the now immobilised<br>
components of the mixture.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the accompanying example.<br>
Example 1<br>
hi an example of this new immunochromatographic system that we term Surface Layer<br>
Immuno-Chromatography (SLIC), a small square of cellulose nitrate membrane is pre-<br>
treated via established methods with a specific antibody to an antigen such as savinase, to<br>
produce a spot of immobilised reagent. This square is stuck on the surface of a plastic strip<br>
pre-coated with one sticky surface. Above this is stuck a second strip of cellulose<br>
impregnated with a dried solution of the same antibody labelled with the reporter enzyme<br>
alkaline phosphatase, together with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Tween 20. The<br>
solution used for this deposition is Tris (pH 9.3) and a volume of 10 ml is used. The<br>
composition of this solution is 0.1 % w/v BSA, 0.1% w/v Tween 20, enzyme-labelled<br>
antibody diluted 1:1000 in Tris buffer (0.1M). The reagents in this format when stored at<br>
room temperature in a desiccator are stable on the strip for at least 14 days.<br>
To perform the assay, a solution of savinase (0.3 ml) in Tris buffer is placed in a test tube<br>
such as a conventional 96 well microtitre plate. The dip strip is now inserted into the well<br>
when both squares are covered by the sample. On wetting, the reagents within the square<br>
of cellulose pass into solution. Due to its higher density this solution now flows as a layer<br>
down the surface of the strip and eventually passes over the lower square containing the<br>
spot of immobilised antibody. In the time interval between immersion of the strip and<br>
arrival of the flowing phase, savinase molecules in the bulk solution will have been<br>
captured by the immobilised antibodies on the lower spot. On arrival of the flowing phase,<br>
labelled antibody will bind to the captured antigen molecules as in a conventional<br>
sandwich-type ELISA, as the solution flows over the spot. This first incubation period is<br>
typically 15 minutes.<br>
The strip is removed from the well and placed in wells containing the commonly used<br>
substrate mixture for alkaline phosphatase, bromochloroindolyl phosphate (BCIP) and<br>
nitroblue tetrazolium salt (NBT). A purple/blue colour develops after 1 minute"s<br>
incubation, the intensity of which is directly proportional to the amount of savinase<br>
captured on the spot during the first incubation step, and hence the concentration of<br>
savinase in the sample. The top square is also coloured purple/blue. A scan of the resulting<br>
strips is shown for this analyte. It should be noted that we use 12 such strips in a comb-like<br>
format as this enables analysis of up to 96 samples/standards (8x12) to be performed with<br>
a single microtitre plate. It will be noted that visual discrimination between the zero and<br>
the 5 ng/ml standard is clearly seen.<br>
Example 2<br>
As in example 1, a small square of cellulose nitrate membrane with a spot of specific<br>
antibody is attached to the surface of a plastic strip. Below this a second strip of cellulose<br>
(cut as 0.4 x 0.6 cm squares from fast hardened filter paper) is placed. This square is<br>
impregnated with a 5 m1 of a diluted solution of the same antibody labelled with the<br>
reporter enzyme alkaline phosphatase, in a solution of blue dextran, (3% w/v), dextran<br>
(25w/v), all in Tris buffer with azide, pH 9.3 (containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.15 (w/v)<br>
bovine serum albumin). The applied solution is allowed to dry at ambient temperature for<br>
30 minutes. A third square of fast hardened filter paper is stuck above the first square and<br>
4*.<br>
is impregnated with the substrate for alkaline phosphatase. This is prepared by addition of<br>
15 ul of a mixture of 1% (w/v) blue dextran, 1% (w/v) dextran and BCIP-NBT stock<br>
solution. It is allowed to dry for 60 minutes at ambient temperature at which point the<br>
square is stuck to the dip strip.<br>
The pre-prepared dip strips are then added to microcuvettes containing 0.6 ml of<br>
standards or samples. After 10 minutes a blue layer of solution is observed at the base of<br>
the cuvette. The strips are used to stir the contents of the cuvettes. This produces a<br>
uniform blue coloration throughout the solution. Incubate for a further 5 minutes then add<br>
500 ml of substrate buffer solution to now cover the top square on the dip strip. Incubate<br>
for a final 10 minutes, then remove the strips and wash with water.<br>
When rabbit anti-savinase antibodies are used as the capture and capping antibodies in<br>
the presence of savinase standards, the following strips are observed when the above<br>
protocol is followed.<br>
The resulting dip strips are illustrated in the accompanying Figure 1, in which:<br>
A= zero standards, B= 10 ng/ml standards of savinase<br>
