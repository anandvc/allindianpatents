FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a connection device for an electric motor, in<br>
particular an external-rotor motor, for connection of winding ends of a stator to a<br>
connecting line, comprising a circuit board, which is arranged on a plane aligned<br>
radially with respect to the stator axis and within a circumferential circle defined<br>
by the stator diameter and has formed conductor track guides and conductor<br>
tracks with connecting lugs for making contact with the stator winding and with<br>
connecting areas for making contact with the connecting line.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A connecting device such as this is known as a circuit board for connection of the<br>
wire ends of a stator winding from the document EP 0 603 478 B1 (D1). The<br>
circuit board comprises a base part which is aligned at right angles to the stator<br>
axis and has a holding opening, which surrounds an end insulation shaft of a<br>
stator, with contact chambers, which are referred to as recesses, for holding<br>
electrical connection elements and with conductor track guides which are<br>
bounded by isolating webs. Conductor tracks in the form of sheet-metal stamped<br>
parts run in the guides. The recesses, which are in the form of pockets, are<br>
arranged in pairs with mirror-image symmetry with respect to a line of symmetry<br>
which runs through the center point of the holding opening. The conductor<br>
tracks, which are in the form of flat plug sections in their end areas, are located<br>
in the recesses, and connecting sockets of a motor connecting line are plugged<br>
onto the conductor tracks in the tangential movement direction. The electrical<br>
contact is therefore provided by a plug and socket system in this case.<br><br><br>
The document DE 202 12 273 U1 (D2) discloses the use of insulation-<br>
displacement terminal contacts for making connections. This document describes<br>
an insulating element, which is formed by extrusion coating and is arranged at<br>
the end of the stator, as a component of a circuit arrangement for direct<br>
connection of winding wires of a stator winding to an electrical connecting line,<br>
with contact elements, which are designed using insulation-displacement<br>
terminal technology, for making contact with the winding wires and the<br>
connecting line being held in the insulating element. A direct electrical<br>
connection is made between the winding wires and the connecting line by means<br>
of the insulation-displacement terminal effect of the insulation-displacement<br>
terminal contacts by means of a process of plugging in and joining a holding<br>
housing to the insulating element. This document does not disclose the use of<br>
conductor tracks as connection elements or wiring elements.<br>
However, these connecting devices have disadvantages. For example, the<br>
technical teaching disclosed in D1 requires four individual plugging-in processes<br>
for the motor to make contact with an external connecting line. Each plugging-in<br>
process must be carried out manually, with tangential insertion of each individual<br>
socket not only requiring precision but also occupying space on a radials plane,<br>
which is often restricted when the motor insulation position is poor.<br>
The embodiment using insulation-displacement terminal technology from D2<br>
likewise has disadvantages. Prefabrication of the external connecting line is<br>
impossible, because contact must be made with the internal winding wires and<br>
the external connecting line at the same time. The electrical connection between<br>
the winding wires and the external connection is made in	<br><br><br>
one process only by fitting a holiday housing, in that the insulation-displacement<br>
terminal contacts which are held in the insulating element cut through the respective<br>
conductor insulation. Furthermore, D2 does not disclose conductor tracks which allow<br>
the winding wire ends to be connected individually.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the object of developing a connecting device of the<br>
type described initially, by means of which the manufacturing process and final motor<br>
assembly can be simplified, in conjunction with a reduction in the number of<br>
components.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the connecting device has a<br>
plug element which can be prefitted to the connecting line and has insulation-<br>
displacement terminal contacts which make contact with the connecting line, and which<br>
plug element can be plugged onto the circuit board parallel to the stator axis such that<br>
the insulation-displacement terminal contacts make contact with the end areas, which<br>
are in the form of contact sections, of the conductor tracks.<br>
The use of insulation-displacement terminal technology in conjunction with the end<br>
areas of the conductor tracks being in the form of contact sections advantageously<br>
avoids the need for relatively complex plug and socket systems as connection elements.<br>
The electrical connection to the connecting line is made simply by plugging on the plug<br>
element, which is fitted with insulation-displacement terminal contacts, according to the<br>
invention. In a further advantageous refinement, the contact sections at the ends of the<br>
conductor tracks are bent at right angles out of the conductor track plane in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the conductor track. The insulation-displacement terminal<br>
contacts engage axially in these contact	<br><br><br>
section. Since the insulation-displacement terminal contacts make direct contact<br>
with the contact sections at the ends of the conductor tracks when the plug<br>
element is plugged on, the electrical connection is made without any additional<br>
connection elements. In this case, the conductor tracks are expediently in the<br>
form of integral stamped and bent parts with contact sections and connecting<br>
lugs or protective-ground conductor connecting sections, in order to further<br>
reduce the range of parts.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, the plug element comprises a cover<br>
surface which is in the form of a circle segment and has a circumferential wall,<br>
into which plug element a radially running channel with an axially-radially<br>
directed opening is incorporated for a kink-protection sleeve, through which the<br>
connecting line runs to pass through. This advantageous allows the external<br>
connecting line to be inserted into the plug element before final assembly of the<br>
motor. The axially-radially directed opening in conjunction with the kink<br>
protection sleeve also allows the connecting line to be fed in an electrically and<br>
mechanically secure form, even in poor installation positions.<br>
It is particularly advantageous for the plug element to have insertion openings<br>
for holding the insulation-displacement terminal contacts. This allows the<br>
connecting cable, which is inserted into the plug element before final assembly,<br>
to be reliably connected by means of the insulation-displacement terminal<br>
contacts. Once the motor manufacturing process has been completed, the<br>
prefabricated plug elements can be mechanically fixed to the motor flange during<br>
the final assembly process by being plugged onto the circuit board, with the<br>
electrical connection to the contact sections of the conductor tracks being<br>
produced at the same time by the insulation-displacement terminal	<br><br>
contacts engaging in the contact sections at the conductor track ends.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective illustration of the connecting device 2 according to the<br>
invention, as individual parts. The connecting device 2 comprises a circuit board 4, in<br>
which conductor tracks 6 are inserted and which is sealed by a cover panel 8. A plug<br>
element 10 associated with the connecting device 2 is described in Figure 5. The circuit<br>
board 4 has a circular holding opening 12a for an end insulation shaft of a stator, and<br>
accordingly extends on a radial plane to a stator axis. For position-fixing and support	<br><br><br>
purposes, the circuit board 4 is provided with spacing pines 15 on its side facing<br>
the stator. Conductor track guides 14, which are bounded by rim webs 16, are<br>
formed on the side facing away from the stator. Positioning pins 17 are integrally<br>
formed on the base of the conductor track guides 14, and project axially. The<br>
conductor track guides 14 run essentially circumferentially in an inner, higher<br>
polygon train 18a and in an outer, lower polygon train 18b, and end in four<br>
contact chambers 20a, 20b which are at corresponding offset heights. The four<br>
contact chambers 20a, 20b are arranged in pairs with mirror-image symmetry<br>
with respect to a line of symmetry, which runs through the center point of the<br>
holding opening 12a, with a symmetry angle a, shown in Figure 3, of about 30°<br>
to 60°, wherein the circuit board 4 has a cutout 23a, which is in the form of a<br>
circle segment, within the opening angle 2 x a between the contact chambers<br>
20a, 20b. The radially outer contact chambers 20b have latching arm openings<br>
22 for latching of the plug element 10, and contact surfaces 19a, 19b which are<br>
integrally formed such that they point away radially.<br>
A hollow-cylindrical attachment 24 with a rim collar 25 is integrally formed<br>
parallel to the stator axis on the circuit board 4, directed toward the stator and<br>
radially opposite the cutout 23a, and is used to hold a temperature monitoring<br>
element. A cover part 26 can be plugged onto the hollow-cylindrical attachment<br>
24, in the corners of which cover part 26 four holes 27 are provided through<br>
which four corresponding plug pins 28, which project axially on the circuit board<br>
4, pass, in order to fix the cover part 26 in its position. The rim collar 25 has<br>
interruptions 25a on the sides at right angles to the outer rim.<br>
In its outer rim areas, the circuit board 4 has supply cutouts 29a, 29b, 29c,<br>
through which the winding wire	<br><br><br>
ends of the stator winding can be passed.<br>
The conductor tracks 6 are stamped such that they correspond to the profile of<br>
the polygon trains 18a, 18b and are inserted into the conductor track guides 14<br>
such that they rest flat on them. In the preferred exemplary embodiment, four<br>
conductor tracks 6 are provided in order to connect the winding wire ends to the<br>
external connecting line 65. Positioning pins 17 pass through positioning holes 30<br>
in the conductor tracks 6 in order to fix the position of the conductor tracks 6.<br>
Those end areas of the conductor tracks 6 which project into the four contact<br>
chambers 20a, 20b are bend at right angles out of the plane of the conductor<br>
track as contact sections 32a, 32b and are thus positioned upright in the contact<br>
chambers 20a, 20b. In this case, the contact sections 32a of the inner conductor<br>
tracks 6 are integrally formed on the outside, and the contact sections 32b of the<br>
outer conductor tracks 6 are integrally formed on the inside. The end walls 34,<br>
which bound the cutout 23a that is in the form of a circle segment, are provided<br>
with axial notches 36 which support the contact sections 32, which run upright,<br>
at their ends while contact is being made.<br>
Connecting lugs 38 for making contact with the winding wire ends or a<br>
protective-ground conductor connecting section 40, which projects into the<br>
holding opening 12, are or is integrally formed at those ends of the conductor<br>
tracks 6 which are not in the form of contact sections 32a, 32b.<br>
The conductor tracks 6 are expediently in the form of integral stamped and bent<br>
parts with contact sections 32a, 32b and connecting lugs 38, and/or a protective-<br>
ground conductor connecting section 40. In this case, as can be seen in the<br>
figures, the connecting lugs 38 are first of all bent at right angles to the<br>
conductor	<br><br><br>
track plane, facing away from the stator, in order to allow them to be soldered or<br>
welded to the winding wire ends. After soldering or welding, the connecting lugs<br>
38 are bent back in the direction of the supply cutouts 29a, 29b, 29c into the<br>
plane of the conductor tracks 6.<br>
On the side facing away from the stator, the circuit board 4 is provided with a<br>
cover panel 8, which has a holding opening 12b and a cutout 23b, which<br>
corresponds to the cutout 23a in the form of a circle segment in the circuit board<br>
4, with an opening angle 2 x β (Fig. 3) which is increased by the circumferential<br>
extent of the contact chambers 20a, 20b such that the contact chambers 20a,<br>
20b are axially accessible for holding the connection elements. For alignment of<br>
the cover panel 8, two alignment pins 48 are integrally formed on the circuit<br>
board 4, projecting axially, and passing through corresponding alignment holes<br>
50 in the cover panel 8. The cover panel 8 has essentially the same<br>
circumferential contour as the circuit board 4, with a circumferential wall 44<br>
clasping the circuit board 4. The circumferential wall 44 is interrupted by two<br>
incisions 46a, 46b which run at right angles on the plane of the cover panel. A<br>
further incision 46c, which is open at the rim, in the cover panel 8 is located<br>
above the hollow-cylindrical attachment 24 when the cover panel 8 is fitted, and<br>
allows the cover part 26 to be fitted in on the cover panel plane.<br>
Figure 2a shows a view of the circuit board 4 with the four conductor tracks 6<br>
that are used. An end section of the respective conductor track 6 is formed<br>
upright as a contact section 32a or 32b and is positioned in the respective<br>
contact chambers 20a, 20b while, in contrast, the other end section of the<br>
respective conductor track 6 is formed in a standing position at right angles to<br>
the conductor track plane, with one or more connecting lugs 38 and/or a<br>
protective-ground	<br><br><br>
conductor connecting section 40. The conductor tracks 6, which follow the outer<br>
polygon train 18b, extend in a symmetrical configuration from the contact<br>
chambers 20b to the section line A-A at the same height as the respective supply<br>
cutouts 29a, 29b. A conductor track 6 follows the inner polygon train 18a and, in<br>
the illustrated view, runs in the clockwise direction from the contact chamber 20a<br>
over the hollow-cylindrical attachment 24 to the supply cutout 29c, where it has<br>
two connecting lugs 38. The fourth conductor track 6 likewise follows the profile<br>
of the inner polygon train 18a, starting with the contact section 32a in the<br>
contact chamber 20a and ending with the protective-ground conductor<br>
connecting section 40 on the section line A-A.<br>
Figure 2b shows a section along the section line A-A in Figure 2a. This illustration<br>
clearly shows the conductor track guides 14, which are offset in height, with<br>
their separating rim webs 16 in the form of an illustration of the radial profile of<br>
the circuit board 4. The conductor tracks 6 are inserted into the conductor track<br>
guides 14. The connecting lugs 38 on the conductor tracks 6 project at right<br>
angles, facing away from the stator, from the protective ground conductor<br>
connecting section 40 and the hollow- cylindrical attachment 24, facing the<br>
stator, out of the conductor track plane. The hollow-cylindrical attachment 24 is<br>
covered by the cover part 26, fixed by the plug pins 28.<br>
Figure 3 shows a view of the circuit board 4, provided with the cover panel 8.<br>
This illustration shows the opening angle 2 x p, which is increased by the<br>
circumferential extent of the contact chambers 20a, 20b, of the cutout 23b,<br>
which is in the form of a circle segment, of the cover panel 8. Because of the<br>
larger opening angle, the contact chambers 20a, 20b are	<br><br><br>
still axially accessible.<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective illustration of the plug element 10. The plug element 10<br>
comprises a cover surface 55, in the form of a circle segment, with a circumferential wall<br>
57 in which a radially running channel 59 with an axially-radially directed opening 61 is<br>
incorporated for a kink-protection sleeve 63 to pass through, through which the<br>
connecting line 65 runs. Four insertion guides 70 are formed along the radially running<br>
sides of the plug element 10, into which the insulation-displacement terminal contacts<br>
68 can be pushed completely at right angles to the cover surface 55, and contact is<br>
made with the individual wires of the connecting line 65 on the base of the insertion<br>
guides 70. The insertion guides 70 are matched to the different heights of the contact<br>
chambers 20a, 20b. This ensures that the insulation-displacement terminal contacts 68<br>
which are located in the insertion guides 70 make reliable contact, with their blades,<br>
which face away from the cover surface 55, with the upright contact sections 32a, 32b<br>
of the conductor tracks 6 when the plug part 10 is being plugged on.<br>
Three latching arms 72 are provided, projecting axially inwards, and their position<br>
corresponds with the three latching arm openings 22 in the circuit board 4.<br>
Figure 5 shows the circuit board 4 mounted on a motor flange 74. The motor flange 74<br>
has a cutout 23c, which is in the form of a circle segment and whose opening angle<br>
extends slightly beyond that of the cutout 23b in the cover panel 8. The preassembled<br>
plug element 10 can be inserted into the cutout 23c. In this case, the plug element 10 is<br>
latched by means of the three latching arms 72 on the circuit board 4, which is mounted<br>
under the motor flange 74 with the insulation-displacement terminal contacts 68 of the<br>
plug element 10 making	<br><br>
contact with the stator winding via the contact sections 32a, 32b of the<br>
conductor tracks 6 and the connecting lugs 38.<br>

illustrated and described, but also covers all embodiments with the same effect<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
"A connecting device for connection of winding ends of a stator of an<br>
electric motor".<br>
The invention relates to a connecting device (2) for an electric motor,<br>
particularly an external rotor motor to connect ends of a stator winding to a<br>
connecting lead (65). Said connecting device (2) is composed of a wiring plate<br>
(4) which is arranged on a plane extending in a radial direction relative to the<br>
stator axis and within a circumferential circle defined by a stator diameter, and<br>
which is provided with terminal areas for contacting the connecting lead (65) as<br>
well as shaped conductor guides (14) and strip conductors (6) with terminal<br>
lugs (38) for contacting the stator winding. A plug element (10) is provided<br>
which can be pre-assembled on the connecting lead (65) and comprises<br>
insulation displacement contacts (68) that contact the connecting lead (65).<br>
The plug element (10) can be mounted on the wiring plate (4) parallel to the<br>
stator axis such that the insulation displacement contacts (68) contact the<br>
terminals areas of the strip conductors (6) embodied as contacting sections<br>
(32a, 32b).</td>
