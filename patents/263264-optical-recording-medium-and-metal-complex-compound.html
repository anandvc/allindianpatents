				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM, METAL COMPLEX COMPOUND AND ORGANIC DYE<br>
COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium and the like, in more detail, an optical recording medium and the like relative to a blue laser beam improved in light stability.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
Various optical recording media such as CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW, MO and the like are widely accepted and used as an external memory device for an information processing equipment such as a computer and the like, since a large capacity of information can be stored and easily and randomly accessed. Among them, an organic dye type optical recording medium provided with a recording layer containing an organic dye compound as represented by CD-R and DVD-R is considered to be superior in terms of a low cost and its easiness manufacturing.<br>
On the other hand, an increase of the amount of information handled has requested an increase of a recording density in a medium and a high density writable and readable optical recording medium has been proposed for use of a laser beam with a short oscillation wavelength such as a blue laser beam and the like that has been significantly developed in recent years. [0003]<br>
However, a commercially available optical recording medium such as CD-R, DVD-R and the like is generally designed, for example, for CD-R to match with a wavelength of the laser beam around 780 nm in writing and reading and for DVD-R to match with a wavelength of the laser beam around 600 to 700 nm in writing and reading. Such recording media suitable for optical writing and reading with use of a relatively long wavelength laser beam have such a problem as use of a shorter wavelength laser beam for writing and reading prevents them from writing and reading because of low reflectance.<br>
For a dye for writing such CD-R and DVD-R, for example, metal-containing azo complex compounds as an optical recording medium is used (see Patent Document 1, Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3). [0004]<br>
Patent Document 1: International Publication: WO 91/18950 Patent Document 2: JP-A 09-277703 Patent Document 3: JP-A 08-295811<br>
I/I<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be solved by the Invention [0005]<br>
The optical recording medium according to above Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 generally uses a compound with an N, N-dialkylaniline structure as a coupling component of an azo compound used in CD-R and DVD-R.<br>
Use of such N, N-dialkylaniline structure is useful because it can give a dye having a very large molar absorption coefficient, but max of a solution of a metal-containing azo complex using such a coupling component is at 500 nm or longer. This indicates that an absorption spectrum of a coated film containing such a dye does not have sufficient absorption to record with a blue laser beam or a laser beam at wavelength around 350 nm. That is, its absorption maximum wavelength is too long. For example, little absorption spectrum is observed near 405 nm, where the blue laser has an oscillation central wavelength, causing a problem such that there is a tendency of yielding low sensitivity to the blue laser beam. Therefore, a coupling component with a large absorption at shorter wavelength side is required. [0006]<br>
On the other hand, according to Patent Document 3, a compound using a pyridone type coupling component is known to have max at shorter wavelength than compounds according to Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2. However, the present inventors have studied and found that compounds even having benzothiazole, thiazole or pyridine as a diazo component according to Patent Document 3 have the maximum absorption wavelength too long and therefore show little absorption at wavelength around 405 nm (between 405 nm -10 nm and 405 nm +5 nm), and thus improving the property as a dye is not promising. Therefore, a combination of a diazo component suitable for absorption at shorter wavelength with a coupling component is required to record in the above wavelength region, [0007]<br>
The present invention is intended to address the problems highlighted in developing an optical recording medium, on which the optical information with higher density than DVD is written and read using, for example, a short wavelength blue laser beam and the like.<br>
That is, an object of the present invention is to provide an optical recording medium, on which the high density optical information is written and read using a short wavelength laser beam of 350 nm or longer and 530 nm or shorter, for example, a laser beam of 385 nm or longer and 410 nm or shorter.<br>
Another object of the present invention is also to provide a metal complex compound suitable for a recording layer or others of the optical recording medium.<br>
Another object of the present invention is further to provide an organic dye compound with improved light stability.<br>
2/2<br><br>
Means for Solving the Problems [0008]<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention [0019]<br>
A best mode to carry out the present invention (referred to as exemplary embodiment hereinafter) will be detailed below. The present invention is, however, not limited to the following exemplary embodiments and various modifications may be carried out within a scope of the invention. Drawings used are also used only to illustrate the present exemplary embodiments, but not intended to represent an actual size.<br>
In addition, a monovalent functional group R1 to R10 in the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III] may have a substituent as needed. However, the term "substituent" in this case or the term "substituent" involved in "may be substituted" or "may have a substituent" described hereinafter does not include an acidic water soluble group such as carboxyl group, sulfonic acid group and the like. It is not desirable that the water soluble group such as the carboxyl group, sulfonic acid group and the like are included in the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III] because its solubility in an organic solvent is reduced. Also, water resistance of the recording layer of the optical recording medium is lowered to make the formation of a consistent film difficult. [0020]<br>
The term "as needed" means proper selection for fine control of solubility in an organic solvent or absorption in a specific wavelength region of the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III] while not significantly affecting the solubility in the organic solvent<br>

[0022]<br>
In the pyridone azo compound represented by the above general formulas [I] to [III], an heteroaromatic ring on the left-hand side of the azo group (-N=N-) is referred to as a diazo component, while a 6-hydroxy-2-pyridone structure on the right-hand side thereof is referred to as a coupling component.<br>
The diazo component in the pyridone azo compound represented by the above general formulas [I] to [III] herein includes, for example, isoxazole, 1,2,4-triazole, pyrazole and the like.<br>
Among them, triazole may have a tautomeric structure, optionally taking a form of the general formulas [II]' and [II]" described below, but is given in a general formula [II] as a representative example. [0023]<br><br>
[0024]<br>

It is found that light stability particularly depends on a combination of a diazo component and a metal complex compound composed of the 6-hydroxy-2-pyridone structure as the coupler structure of the present invention. Light stability is good and stable in a metal complex compound of the present invention with the general formula [II], that is, one containing triazole as a diazo component and tends to decrease in the order of a metal complex of the present invention with the general formula [III] followed by that with the general formula [I]. It is also found that light stability is correlated with R1 to R10 as the substituents thereof. However, light stability described in the present invention includes the case where poor solubility results in poor light stability. These results are given in Table 1. Any metal complex compound of the present invention with the general formula [II], which has good and stable light stability has good light stability as far as R1 to R3 and R6 to R7 are chosen from the above ones. In contrast, a metal complex compound of the present invention with the general formula [III] and that with the general formula [I] each have a particular combination of substituent R, which leads to undesirable solubility or light stability as shown below (see Table 1).<br>
17/17<br>
In the optical recording medium characterized in that the above organic dye compound is the pyridone azo compound represented by the following general formula [I]: [0064]<br><br><br>
[0065]<br>
R1 in the general formula [I] is preferably a monovalent functional group except an unsubstituted amino group (-NH2). R2 to R5 each are independently preferably a hydrogen atom or a monovalent functional group. Namely, when R1 is an unsubstituted amino group (-NH2), solubility decreases depending on a combination with substituents R2 to R5, resulting in a possible decrease of light stability.<br>
A combination of a cyano group as R2 and an alkyl group as R3 shows more preferred trend.<br>
In the optical recording medium characterized in that the above organic dye compound is the pyridone azo compound represented by the following general formula (IV): [0066]<br><br>
[0067]<br>
R31 in the general formula (IV) is preferably a monovalent functional group except a hydrogen atom. R26 to R30 each are independently preferably a hydrogen atom or a monovalent functional group.<br>
When R31 is a hydrogen atom, solubility is reduced and light stability is possibly deteriorated.<br>
A combination of a cyano group as R27 and an alkyl group as R28 shows more preferred trend.<br>
Except the above unfavorable combination, use of a combination of preferred R1 to R10 in the general formulas [I] to [III] as described above and R26 to R31 corresponding to R1 to R10 gives good light stability. [0068] (Metal ion)<br>

compound. [0069]<br>
A- preferred structure of the complex formed between the metal and the pyridone azo compound has a structure in which one divalent metal is coordinated with two pyridone azo compounds in terms of ease of the complex formation since the pyridone azo compound becomes a tridenate ligand with one negative charge. That is, a metal ion forming a metal complex with the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III] is preferably a divalent metal chosen from group 3 to group 12 in the periodic table (in the long form). Among these divalent metals, at least one kind of the metal chosen from nickel, cobalt, iron, zinc, copper and manganese is particularly preferred.<br>

[0081]<br>
(Optical recording medium)<br>
The optical recording medium applicable to the present exemplary embodiment is next described.<br>
The optical recording medium applicable to the present exemplary embodiment is composed of at least a substrate and a recording layer containing the metal complex compound of the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III]. An undercoat layer, a reflective layer, a protective layer and the like may be further provided as needed.<br>
FIGs. l(a) and l(b) are figures explaining optical recording medium which this exemplary embodiment is applied to, where FIG. l(a) is a figure for first exemplary embodiment, and FIG. l(b) is a figure for second exemplary embodiment. . [0082] (First exemplary embodiment)<br>
Optical recording medium 10 shown in FIG. l(a) is laminated in turn with a substrate 1 composed of light transmitting material 1, recording layer 2 formed on substrate 1 and reflective layer 3 and protective layer 4 laminated on recording layer 2. Optical recording medium 10 is irradiated with a laser beam from the side of substrate 1 to record and read information.<br>
In addition, in the optical recording medium 10, for convenience of the explanation, the side on which protective layer 4 is present and the side on which substrate 1 is present are referred to as upside and downside, respectively, and a face of each layer corresponding to these directions is referred to as the upper surface and the lower surface, respectively. [0083]<br>
Various materials can be used as substrate 1 as far as the material is basically transparent at the wavelength of recording light and reading light. Specifically, they include, for example, resins<br>
25/25<br><br>
such as acrylic type resins, methacrylic type resins, polycarbonate resins, polyolefin type resins (particularly amorphous polyolefin), polyester type resins, polystyrene resins, epoxy resins and the like; and glass. They also include a structure in which a resin layer composed of radiation curable resins such as a light curable resin and the like is formed on glass. Among them, polycarbonate resin used in an injection molding method is preferred in terms of high productivity, cost, moisture resistance and the like and amorphous polyolefins are preferred in terms of chemical resistance, moisture resistance and the like. Also, glass is preferred in terms of fast response and the like. [0084]<br>
When resin substrate 1 or a substrate 1 provided with a resin layer next to the recording layer (upside) is used, a guide groove or pits for writing and reading light may be formed on the upper surface. A shape of the guide groove includes a concentric pattern based on a center of optical recording medium 10 or a spiral pattern. When the spiral guide groove is formed, a groove pitch is preferably in the range of about 0.2 to 1.2 urn. [0085]<br>
Recording layer 2 is formed directly on upside of substrate 1 or upside of an undercoat layer disposed on substrate 1 as needed and contains the metal complex compound of the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III]. A film forming method of recording layer 2 includes various methods generally used to form a thin film such as vacuum deposition method, sputtering method, doctor blade method, casting method, spin coating method, immersion coating method and the like. The spin coating method is preferred in terms of mass productivity and cost while the vacuum deposition method is more preferred than the coating method in terms of acquiring recording layer 2 with a uniform thickness. When the spin coating method is used to form a film, the number of revolution is preferably 500 to 15000 rpm. After spin coating, the recording layer may be treated such as heating or exposing to a solvent vapor, depending on circumstances. [0086]<br>
When recording layer 2 is formed by a coating method such as a doctor blade method, casting method, spin coating method or immersion coating method, a coating solvent used to dissolve the metal complex compound of the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III] and coat substrate 1 is not particularly limited as far as it does not erode substrate 1.<br>
Specifically it includes, for example, ketone alcohol solvents such as diacetone alcohol, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-butanone and the like; cellosolve solvents such as methylcellosolve, ethylcellosolve and the like; linear hydrocarbon solvents such as n-hexane, n-octane and the like; cyclic hydrocarbon solvents such as cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, dimethylcyclohexane, n-butylcyclohexane, tert-butylcyclohexane, cyclooctane and the like; perfluoroalkyl alcohol solvents such as tetrafluoropropanol, octafluoropentanol, hexafluorobutanol and the like; hydroxycarboxylate ester solvents such as methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl<br>
26/26<br><br>
2-hydroxyisobutyrate and the like; and others. [0087]<br>
When the vacuum deposition method is used, for example, the compound represented by the general formulas and as needed, a recording layer component such as other dyes or various additives are added to a crucible placed in a vacuum vessel, which is evacuated to a level of about 10' to 10' Pa by a proper vacuum pump and then the crucible is heated to vaporize the recording layer component to deposit onto the substrate facing the crucible to form recording layer 2. [0088]<br>
Also, recording layer 2 may contain, in addition to the metal complex compound of the pyridone azo compound represented by the general formulas [I] to [III], a transition metal chelate compound as a singlet oxygen quencher (for example, acetylacetonate chelate, bisphenyldithiol, salicylaldehydeoxime, bisdithio-a-diketone and the like) in order to improve stability and light stability or also may concern a recording sensitivity improver of metal type compounds and the like in order to increase recording sensitivity.<br>
The metal type compounds herein are the compound, in which a metal such as a transition metal and the like is contained in a form of an atom, ion, cluster and the like and include organic metal compounds, for example, ethylenediamine type complex, azomethine type complex, phenylhydroxyamine type complex, phenanthroline type complex, dihydroxyazobenzene type complex, dioxime type complex, nitrosoaminophenol type complex, pyridyltriazine type complex, acetylacetonate type complex, metallocene type complex and porphyrin type complex. The metal atom is not particularly limited, but is preferably a transition metal atom. [0089]<br>
In addition, plural kinds of the metal complex compound of the pyridone azo compounds represented by the general formulas [1] to [III] may be used in combination for recording "layer 2 as needed. Further, for recording layer 2, there may be used other type of dyes as needed in addition to the metal complex compound of the pyridone azo compound.<br>
Other type dye is not particularly limited as far as it has mainly proper absorption in the oscillation wavelength region of a laser beam for writing. A dye used in CD-R and the like suitable to record and read by a near-infrared laser beam with an oscillation wavelength in the wavelength region of 770 nm to 830 nm or a dye used in DVD-R and the like suitable to record and read by a red laser beam with an oscillation wavelength in the wavelength region of 620 nm to 690 nm may also be used in combination with the pyridone azo compound in recording layer 2 to manufacture optical recording medium 10 responding to plural kinds of laser beam belonging to different wavelength regions. Also, a dye having a good light stability is chosen from the above dyes for CD-R or DVD-R and mixed with the compound of the present invention to enable further improvement of light stability. [0090]<br>
A type of the dyes other than metal complex compounds of the pyridone azo compounds<br>
27/27<br><br>
represented by the general formulas [I] to [III] includes, for example, metal-containing azo type dye, benzophenone type dye, phthalocyanine type dye, naphthalocyanine type dye, cyanine type dye, azo type dye, sqarylium type dye, metal-containing indoaniline type dye, triarylmethane type dye, merocyanine type dye, azulenium type dye, naphthoquinone type dye, anthraquinone type dye, indophenol type dye, xanthene type dye, oxazine type dye, pyrilium type dye and the like. [0091]<br>
Further, a binder, a leveling agent, an antifoaming agent and the like may be used in combination as needed. Preferred binders include polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, ketone type resin, acryl type resin, polystyrene type resin, urethane type resin, polyvinylbutyral, polycarbonate, polyolefin and the like. [0092]<br>
Film thickness of recording layer 2 is not particularly limited because its proper thickness varies with a recording method and the like, but is generally at least 1 (one) nm or more, preferably 5 nm or more because a certain thickness is required for recording. However, its thickness is generally 300 nm or less, preferably 200 nm or less, more preferably 100 nm or less. When the film of recording layer 2 is excessively thick, good recording could not be achieved. [0093]<br>
Reflective layer 3 is formed on recording layer 2. Thickness of reflective layer 3 is preferably 50 nm to 300 nm. A material for reflective layer 3 uses a material with sufficiently high reflectance at wavelength of reading light, for example, a metal such as Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta, Pd and the like singly or as an alloy. Among them, Au, Al, Ag and Cu have high reflectance and are suitable as a material of reflective layer 3. These metals may be used as a major component, to which other material may be added. A major component herein indicates the one with a content 50% or higher. Materials other than the major component include metals and semimetals, for example, Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn, Bi, Ta, Ti, Pt, Pd, Nd and the like. [0094]<br>
Among these metals and semimetals, a material having Ag as a major component is particularly preferred because of low cost, ease to obtain high reflectance and formation of beautiful white ground color when forming ink accepting layer for print described hereinafter. For example, an alloy containing more than one kind of metals selected from Au, Pd, Pt, Cu and Nd in a range of about 0.1 atom% to 5 atom% in Ag is preferred because of high reflectance, high durability, high sensitivity and low cost. Specifically they are an Ag-Pd-Cu alloy, an Ag-Cu-Au alloy, an Ag-Cu-Au-Nd alloy, an Ag-Cu-Nd alloy and the like. A material other than metals may be formed by alternate deposition of a low refractive index thin film and a high refractive index film to yield a multilayer film, which can be used as reflective layer 3. [0095]<br>
A method to form reflective layer 3 includes, for example, sputtering method, ion plating<br>
28/28<br><br>
method, chemical deposition method, vacuum deposition method and the like. Also, known inorganic or organic intermediate layer and adhesive layer may be disposed on substrate 1 or beneath reflective layer 3 in order to increase reflectance, improve recording characteristics and increase adhesiveness, and others. [0096]<br>
Protective layer 4 is formed on reflective layer 3. A material for protective layer 4 is not particularly limited as far as it can protect reflective layer 3 from external force. Materials of organic substances include thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, electron beam curable resins, UV curable resins and the like. Also, inorganic substances include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, MgF2, SnO2 and the like. [0097]<br>
When thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins and the like are used, they are dissolved in a proper solvent to prepare a coating solution, which is applied to reflective layer 3 and then dried to form protective layer 4. When a UV curable resin is used, it may be applied as it is to reflective layer 3 or dissolved in a proper solvent to prepare a coating solution, which is applied to reflective layer 3 and then irradiated with UV light to cure to form protective layer 4. [0098]<br>
For example, acrylate type resins such as urethane acrylate, epoxy acrylate, polyester acrylate and the like can be used as the UV curable resin. These materials may be used singly or as a mixture of plural kinds. The protective layer may be formed of a monolayer or plural layers. [0099]<br>
A method to form protective layer 4 uses, similarly to formation of recording layer 2, a coating method such as spin coating method, casting method and the like, sputtering method, chemical deposition method and the like, but among them a spin coating method is preferred. Thickness of the protective layer 4 is generally 0.1 m or more, preferably 3 m or more because a certain thickness is required to perform protective function. However, its thickness is generally 100 m or less, preferably 30 urn or less. When the film of protective layer 4 is excessively thick, not only effectiveness changes little but also a longer period is required to form protective layer 4, and also cost could be higher. [0100]<br>
As described above, a structure formed by lamination of substrate 1, recording layer 2, reflective layer 3 and protective layer 4 in this order is used as illustrative example for the structure of optical recording medium 10, but other layer structure may be used. [0101]<br>
For example, other substrate 1 may be laminated on the upper surface of protective layer 4 of the layer structure of the above example or on the upper surface of reflective layer 3 after omitting protective layer 4 from the layer structure of the above example. Substrate 1 in this case may be the substrate itself without having any layer or the one having any layer such as reflective<br>
29/29<br><br>
layer 3 and the like on the laminated surface or its opposing surface. Further, optical recording<br>
medium 10 having the layer structure of the above example or optical recording medium 10<br>
omitting protective layer 4 from the layer structure of the above example is made to face the upper<br>
face of protective layer 4 and/or reflective layer 3, to each other and laminated.<br>
[0102]<br>
(Second exemplary embodiment)<br>
Second exemplary embodiment of the optical recoding medium is next described.<br>
FIG. 1(B) is a figure to describe second exemplary embodiment of the optical recording medium. Common parts with optical recording medium 10 in first exemplary embodiment are given the same reference letters and their explanation is omitted.<br>
Optical recording medium 20 shown in FIG. 1(B) is laminated with a substrate 1 composed of a light transmitting material, reflective layer 3 provided on substrate 1, recording layer 2 laminated on reflective layer 3 and protective film 5 in this order. Optical recording medium 20 is irradiated with a laser beam from a side of protective film 5 to record and read information. [0103]<br>
Protective film 5 may be laminated with a film or sheet-like material by an adhesive or formed using a similar material to above protective layer 4, to which a coating liquid for film formation is applied, cured and dried. Thickness of protective film 5 is generally 0.1 m or more, preferably 3 m or more since a certain thickness is required to serve protective function. However, thickness is generally 300 urn or less, preferably 200 m or less. When the protective film 5 is excessively thick, not only effectiveness changes little but also a longer period is required to form protective film 5 and cost could be higher. [0104]<br>
Each layer of recording layer 2, reflective layer 3 and the like may use materials similar to the above optical recording medium 10. However, the substrate 1 with the composition of these layers may not necessarily be transparent but opaque resins, ceramics, metals (including alloys) and the like may be used in addition to the above materials. An arbitrary layer may be present between each of the layers as needed so far as features of the present invention are not impaired. [0105]<br>
By the way, one way to increase the recording density of optical recording medium 10 and 20 includes increasing a numerical aperture of the objective lens. This can make optical spots focused onto the information recording surface smaller. However, as the numerical aperture of the objective lens is increased, irradiation with a laser beam for writing and reading is likely to cause an increase of aberration of the optical spots due to warping and the like of optical recording medium 10 and 20, resulting in difficulty to obtain good record and read signals with high stability. [0106]<br>
Since aberration is likely to be larger as the film thickness of the transparent substrate and the protective film through which a laser beam is transmitted becomes larger, the substrate and<br>
30/30<br><br>
protective film are made preferably as thin a.s possible in order to make the aberration smaller. However, because substrate 1 needs a certain thickness to secure the strength of optical recording medium 10 and 20, in this case, use of the structure of optical recording medium 20 (optical recording medium 20 with the basic layer structure composed of substrate 1, reflective layer 3, recording layer 2 and protective film 5) is preferred.. Since thinning of protective film 5 in optical recording medium 20 is easier than thinning of substrate 1 in optical recording medium 10, optical recording medium 20 is preferably used. [0107]<br>
However, even in the structure of optical recording medium 10 (optical recording medium 10 with the basic layer structure composed of substrate 1, recording layer 2, reflective layer 3 and protective layer 4), the transparent substrate 1, through which a laser beam for writing and reading is transmitted, may be thinned to a range of about 50 urn to 300 m to make aberration smaller for use. [0108]<br>
Further, after formation of each other layer, a film such as ultraviolet curing resin layer, inorganic type thin film and the like may be formed on a plane of incidence of a laser beam for writing and reading (generally a lower surface of substrate 1) in order to protect the surface or prevent dirt and the like from adhering and an ink accepting layer, on which writing and printing are made possible using various printers such as ink jet printer or thermal transfer printer or various writing utensils may be formed on the surface, which is not a plane of incidence of a laser beam for writing and reading (generally an upper surface of reflective layer 3 or protective layer 4). [0109]<br>
In optical recording media 10 and 20 applicable to the present exemplary embodiment, shorter wavelength of a laser beam used in writing and reading information is preferable in terms of achieving a higher recording density, and a laser beam at wavelength of 350 nm to 530 nm is particularly preferred. A typical example of such laser beam includes a laser beam with center wavelength at 405 nm, 410 nm and 515 nm. [0110]<br>
A laser beam at wavelength of 350 nm to 530 nm can be obtained using a high power blue semiconductor laser beam at wavelength of 405 nm and 410 nm or blue green high power semiconductor laser beam at wavelength of 515 nm. It can be also obtained as others, for example, by converting wavelength, with a second harmonic generation element (SHG), of an oscillated laser beam either (a) from a semiconductor laser beam capable of continuous oscillation with a fundamental oscillation wavelength at wavelength of 740 nm to 960 nm or (b) a solid laser beam capable of continuous oscillation with a fundamental oscillation wavelength at 740 nm to 960 nm excited by a semiconductor laser beam. [0111]<br>
In addition, SHG may be any piezoelements lacking inversion symmetry, but preferably<br>
31/31<br><br>
compound semiconductors such as KDP, ADP, BNN, KN and LBO. Specific examples of the second harmonic wave include a laser beam at 430 nm corresponding to a double wave of the fundamental oscillation wavelength in a semiconductor laser beam with the fundamental oscillation wavelength at 860 nm or a laser beam at 430 nm corresponding to a double wave from LiSrAlF6 crystals doped with Cr (fundamental oscillation wavelength at wavelength of 860 nm) in a solid laser beam excited by a semiconductor laser beam. [0112]<br>
When information is recorded on optical recording media 10 and 20 applicable to the present exemplary embodiment, recording layer 2 is irradiated with a laser beam focused to a level of about 0.4 m to 0.6 m (generally beam transmitting through substrate 1 from the side of substrate 1). The spot of recording layer 2 where laser beam is irradiated absorbs energy of the laser beam to cause thermal deformation such as decomposition, heat generation, dissolution and the like to change optical properties. [0113]<br>
When information recorded on recording layer 2 is read, the same recording layer 2 is irradiated with a laser beam with lower energy (generally from the same direction as recording). In recording layer 2, the information is reproduced by detecting difference of the reflectance between the spots with a change of optical properties (that is, a section recorded with information) and the spots without a change of oprical properties. [Examples] [0114]<br>
The present exemplary embodiment is specifically described based on the examples below. The present exemplary embodiment is not limited to these examples as far as it does not exceed a scope of the invention. (Synthetic method of pyridone azo compound)<br>

FIG. 2 shows an absorption spectrum of the coated film of metal complex compound (58). [0132]<br>
A fragment of the disc coated with metal complex compound (58) was irradiated with a Xe lamp with 550 mW at 63 °C for 40 hours using a fade meter (Toyo Seiki Seisaku-Sho Ltd., Suntest XLS+). Then, a UV spectrometer was used to measure the absorbance (I0) at mux before irradiation with the Xe lamp and the absorbance [I] at max after irradiation with the Xe lamp, respectively. Then, a ratio of I to I0 (I/I0) (%) was determined to evaluate light stability (the larger the value, the better the light stability).<br>
As a result, light stability ((I/I0) (%)) of metal complex compound (58) was 63.2%, indicating very good light stability for a dye film showing the maximum absorption wavelength (max) at 500 nm or less. [0133]<br>
A substrate separately coated with metal complex compound (58) was kept in a constant temperature and humidity bath under a condition of 85 °C and a relative humidity of 85% for 200 hours. An absorption spectrum of the substrate was then measured and compared with the absorbance before set in the coastant temperature and humidity bath (at the same max wavelength as the one before test) to evaluate shelf-life stability. As a result, its value was 97.3%, indicating excellent stability.<br>

(Comparative example 1)<br>
Compound [13] given below was synthesized for comparison and evaluated as an optical<br>
recording medium.	. '<br>
(a) Manufacturing Example<br>
Diazotization of 2-amino-6-methylbenzothiazole (from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) represented by the following structural formula (referred to as compound [11] hereinafter) was performed using a similar method and coupled under similar condition as example 1 to synthesize compound [12], which had max at 453.5 nra and the molar absorption coefficient of 3.2 x 104 in chloroform.<br>
Compound [12] was then metallized with nickel acetate to form a metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by the following structural formula [13], of which a chloroform solution had max at 524 nm and the molar absorption coefficient of 7.4 x 104. [0176]<br><br>
[0179]<br>
(b) Example of optical recording medium<br>
The metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by the above structural formula (13) was tried to dissolve in octafluoropentanol to prepare a solution with the concentration of 1 (one) wt%, but its solubility was low to leave a half of it to be insoluble. The mixture was filtered<br>
49/49<br><br>
to form a dissolved solution, which was dropped to apply by a spin coating method (500 rpm) on an injection molded polycarbonate resin substrate with a diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 0.6 mm and then dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The coated film had the maximum absorption wavelength (max) at 542.5 nm. It has little absorption at wavelength of 405 nm and it shows it hardly enables the writing with the laser beam with center wavelength of 405 nm.<br>
FIG. 6 represented by the structural formula. [13] shows an absorption spectrum of the coated film of metal-containing pyridone azo compound. It is found from the results in Figure 6 that the metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by structural formula [13] is a metal-containing pyridone azo compound, but an insufficient dye for the writing with the blue laser beam unless isoxazole, 1,2,4-triazole or pyrazole is not chosen as a diazo component. [0180] (Comparative example 2)<br>
The metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by structural formula [15] was synthesized for comparison and evaluated for an optical recording medium, (a) Manufacturing example<br>
Diazotization of 2-amino-5-methyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was performed using a similar method and coupled under similar condition as example 1 to synthesize following compound [14], which had max at 409.5 nm and the molar absorption coefficient of 3.0 x 104 in chloroform. [0181]<br><br>
[0182]<br>
Compound (14) was similarly metallized with nickel acetate to form the metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by structural formula [15], of which a chloroform solution had max at 494 nm and the molar absorption coefficient of 7.1 x 104.<br>
FIG. 7 represented by the structural formula [15] shows an absorption spectrum of metal-containing pyridone azo compound. It is found from the results shown in Figure 7 that the metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by structural formula [15] has an absorption near 405 nm as an absorption tail and littler writing feature is anticipated. [0183] [Formula 51]<br>
50,50<br><br><br>
(b) Example of optical recording medium<br>
The metal-containing pyridone azo compound represented by structural formula [15] was tried to dissolve in octafluoropentanol to prepare a solution with the concentration of 1 (one) wt%, but its solubility was too low to be dissolved. The mixture was filtered to give a dissolved solution, which was dropped to apply by a spin coating method (500 rpm) on an injection molded polycarbonate resin substrate with a diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 0.6 mm and then dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes. However, an absorption spectrum of the coated film was not obtained because of the poor solubility. [0185] (Comparative example 3)<br>
The metal-containing azo complex compound represented by the following structural formula [16] was synthesized for comparison and evaluated as an optical recording medium, (a) Manufacturing example<br>
As referring to above Patent Document 2 (JP-A 09-277703), the compound represented by the following structural formula [16] synthesized using m-N, N-diethylaniline as a raw material in chloroform had two peaks at max of 552.5 nm and 516 nm with the molar absorption coefficient of 1.1x 105 and 8.6x 104, respectively.<br>
FIG. 8 represented by the structural formula [16] shows an absorption spectrum of metal-containing azo compound in chloroform. [0186]<br><br>
[0187]<br>
(b) Example of optical recording medium<br>
Metal-containing azo compound represented by the above structural formula [16]was dissolved in octafluoropentanol to prepare a solution with the concentration of 1 wt%. This solution was filtered to prepare a dissolved solution, which was dropped to apply by a spin coating<br>
51/51<br><br>
method (500 rpm) on an injection molded polycarbonate-resin substrate with a diameter of 120 mm and a thickness of 1.2 mm and then dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The coated film had the maximum absorption wavelength (max) at 565.5 nm, 524.5nm.<br>
It is found that an absorption spectrum of the metal-containing azo complex compound represented by structural formula [16] has little absorption near wavelength of 405 nm even if it contains isoxazole as a diazo component.<br>
These results indicate that the metal-containing azo complex compound represented by structural formula [16] is an unsatisfactory dye compound for the writing with the blue laser beam, even if the metal-containing azo complex compound contains isoxazole as a diazo component but not a pyridone structure as a coupling component. [0188] (Examples 20 to 27)<br>
Using a method similar to the synthetic method in Example 1, pyridone azo compounds represented by exemplary compound (57) and the following exemplary compound (58) to exemplary compound (63) were used to synthesize metal complex compounds (77) to (84), of which the maximum absorption wavelength (max) in solution (chloroform), the molar absorption coefficients and the maximum absorption wavelength (max) of the coated film (octafluoropentanol was used as a coating solvent) are measured. The measured results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Considering that, in writing and reading in a short wavelength region described in the present invention, the value of light stability, that is, dye retention (I/I0 in Table 1, (%)) of any conventionally known organic dyes for short wavelength writing and reading is less than 10%, it can be said that the value of light stability, that is, the above dye retention is 60% or higher is regarded as extremely good.<br>
Metal complex compounds described in Table I are extremely good from such evaluation criteria. Among them, Examples 23, 26 and 27 are better in light stability than conventionally known dyes and the compounds with sufficiently practicable light stability. If more critically asked, they are likely to be slightly worse than other metal complex compounds listed in Table 1.<br>
That is, comparison of Example 23 (light stability, 19.0%) with Example 1 (light stability, 63.2%) suggests the presence of an unsubstituted amino group (-NH2) in R1 of the general formula [I] is not so good as described previously. However, Example 23 is still in sufficiently good level as compared with conventional compounds and combination with substituents R2 to R5 can increase solubility and improve light stability.<br>
Also, as found in a comparison of Example 26 (light stability, 14.5%) and Example 27 (light stability, 42.3%) with Example 25 (light stability, 67.5%), presence of a hydrogen atom as R10 in the general formula [III] suggests deterioration of light stability. Further, comparison between Example 26 (light stability, 14.5%) and Example 27 (light stability, 42.3%), and comparison between Example 25 (light stability, 67.5%) and Example 17 (light stability, 89%) indicate that a combination of a hydrogen atom in R1 and a carboxylate ester in R3 in the general<br>
52/52<br><br>
formula [III] is likely to deteriorate light stability. A copper complex (Example 22) is found to be a slightly worse than the other metal complex compounds in Table 1, but is still much better compound than conventionally known organic dyes at any rate for the shorter wavelength blue laser.
