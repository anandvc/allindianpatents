				<td>CHEMICAL PROCESS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing the strobilurin fungicide methyl (E)-2- {2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl} -3-methoxyacrylate (azoxystrobin) and a novel precursor thereof.<br>
Methods for preparing azoxystrobin are described in WO 92/08703. In one method, azoxystrobin is prepared by reacting 2-cyanophenol with methyl (E)-2-[2-(6-chloro-pyrirnidin-4~yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxyacrylate.<br>
A high-yielding method for producing asymmetrical 4,6-bis(aryloxy)pyrimidine derivatives is disclosed in WO 01/72719 in which a 6-chloro-4-aryloxypyrimidine is reacted with a phenol, optionally in the presence of a solvent and/or a base, with the addition of from 2 to 40 mol % of l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO).<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that, when preparing azoxystrobin or a novel acetal precursor of azoxystrobin using DABCO as a catalyst, significantly smaller amounts of this relatively expensive catalyst may be used than are contemplated in WO 01/72719 without compromising the yield. Apart from reducing the cost of manufacture, this has the added environmental benefit of reducing the quantity of catalyst discharged in the aqueous process effluent.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula (I):<br>
(Formula I Removed)<br>
wherein W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group C(CO2CH3)=CHOCH3 or the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group C(CO2CH3)CH(OCH3)2, or a mixture of the two groups, which comprises either (a) reacting a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Formula II Removed)<br>
wherein W has the meaning given above, with 2-cyanophenol, or a salt thereof (suitably potassium 2-cyanophenoxide) in the presence of between 0.1 and 2 mol % of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, or (b) reacting the compound of formula (IE):<br>
 <br>
(Formula III Removed)<br>
with a compound of formula (IV):<br>
 <br>
(Formula IV  Removed)<br>
where W has the meaning given above, in the presence of between 0.1 and 2 mol % of l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the process of invention comprises reacting a compound of formula (II):<br>
(Formula II Removed)<br>
wherein W has the meaning given above, with 2-cyanophenol, or a salt thereof (suitably potassium 2-cyanophenoxide) in the presence of between 0.1 and 2 mol % of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.<br>
The compound of formula (I) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group C(CO2CH3)CH(OCH3)2 [that is, the compound methyl 2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate (hereinafter referred to as 'azoxystrobin acetal')], is a novel compound and forms part of the present invention. In particular, the invention includes isolated azoxystrobin acetal in substantially pure form [that is in an isolated form which comprises from 85 to 100 weight %, preferably from 90 to 100 weight %, of azoxystrobin acetal].<br>
When the process of the invention is carried out using a compound of formula (II) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group or using a compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, the product obtained may include a proportion of the compound of formula (I) where W is the methyl (£)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group. This may happen because it is possible that methanol is eliminated from the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group under the conditions of the process. For the same reason, if the process is carried out using a compound of formula (II) or a compound of formula (IV) where W is a mixture of the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group and the methyl (£)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group (and the invention includes such a process), the product obtained will be a compound of formula (I) where W is a mixture of the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group and the methyl (£)~2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group; however, the product may have a higher proportion of the compound of formula (I) where W is the methyl (JF)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group than expected from the proportion of (E)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group in the mixed starting material due to this potential elimination of methanol. This is of no real consequence because it will normally be required to convert the product of formula (I) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group to the compound of formula (I) where W is the group methyl (£)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group by the elimination of methanol, as discussed later.<br>
Conveniently the process of the invention is carried out in a suitable inert solvent or diluent. These include, for example, aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum ether, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and decalin; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachlpride, dichloroethane and trichloroethane; heteroaromatic solvents such as pyridine or a substituted pyridine, for example, 2,6-dimethylpyridine; ethers, such as diethyl ether, dizsopropylether, methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-tert-amyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane and anisole; ketones, such as acetone, butanone, methyl wobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, n- and z'-butyronitrile and benzonitrile; amides, such as A/",N-dimethylformamide, N.TV-dimethylacetamide, 7V-methylformamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone and hexamethylphosphoric triamide; tertiary amines, in particular, amines of the formula R'R2R3N where R1, R2 and R3 are each independently Ci-io (especially Ci-g) alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl, aryl (especially phenyl) or aryl(Ci-4)alkyl (especially benzyl); or two or three<br>
of R1, R2 and R3 join together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form one, two or three 5-, 6- or 7-membered alicyclic rings optionally fused and optionally containing a second ring nitrogen atom, examples of suitable tertiary amines being N,N-di-isopropylethylamine (Hunig's base), N,N-dimethylaniline, triethylamine, N,N-butyldimethyl-amine, N,N-di/sopropylmethylamine, N,N-diwopropylwobutylamine, N,N-diz.s0propyl-2-ethylbutylamine, N,N-butylamine, N,N-dicyclohexylmethylamine, N,N-dicyclohexylethyl-amine, N,N-butylcyclohexylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene or 2-dimethylaminopyridine; esters, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and isopropyl acetate; sulphoxides, such as dimethylsulphoxide; sulphones, such as sulpholane; and mixtures of such solvents and diluents and mixtures of one or more of them with water. Particularly suitable diluents are ketones [such as methyl zsobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone], esters [such as isopropyl acetate], tertiary amines [such as N,N-dissopropylethylamine (Hunig's base)] and amides [such as 7V,N-dimethylformamide]. In a particular aspect of the present invention, methyl wobutyl ketone is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, cyclohexanone is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, isopropyl acetate is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, N,N-dimethylformamide is used as diluent. In a further aspect of the present invention, N,N-diwopropylethylamine (HUnig's base) is used as diluent. Most suitably, the diluent used in the present invention is N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the process is carried out in aqueous two phase solvent system. Suitably, in this embodiment, when the compound of formula (II) is reacted with 2-cyanophenol, the 2-cyanophenol is present as a salt. Most suitably, the salt is potassium 2-cyanophenoxide. Advantageously, the water is removed throughout the reaction. Suitable co-solvents for use in such an aqueous process are solvents which are at least partially water immiscible solvents such as cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone and isopropyl acetate. Most suitably, when such an aqueous system is used, the salt of 2-cyanophenol is potassium 2-cyanophenoxide and the diluent is cyclohexanone, methyl zsobutyl ketone or isopropyl acetate. It is noted that when the 2-cyanophenol is added to the process as an aqueous solution of potassium 2-cyanophenoxide it is possible to reduce the quantity of acid acceptor (see below) used.<br>
In addition, the process of the invention is conveniently carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor. Suitable acid acceptors are all customary inorganic and organic bases.<br>
These include, for example, alkaline earth metal and alkali metal hydroxides, acetates, carbonates, bicarbonates and hydrides [such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, calcium hydride, sodium hydride and potassium hydride], guanidines, phosphazines (see, for example, Liebigs Ann. 1996, 1055-1081), prophosphatranes (see, for example, JACS 1990, 9421-9422) and tertiary amines [such as those described above as possible solvents or diluents]. Particularly suitable acid acceptors are the alkaline earth metal and alkali metal carbonates, especially potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate and the tertiary amines l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. More suitably, the acid acceptor is potassium carbonate. Most suitably, the present invention is carried out in the presence of methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, isopropyl acetate, TV.Af-diz'.sopropylethylamine (Hiinig's base) or A^N-dimethylformamide with potassium carbonate as the acid acceptor.<br>
The process of the invention is carried out in the presence of between 0.1 and 2 mol% of l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), that is more than 0.1 but less than 2 mol% of DABCO. Preferably, it is carried out in the presence of between 0.2 and 2 mol% of DABCO. Any amount of DABCO between 0.1 or 0.2 and 2, 0.1 or 0.2 and 1.9, 0.1 or 0.2 and 1.8, 0.1 or 0.2 and 1.7, 0.1 or 0.2 and 1.6 and 0.1 or 0.2 and 1.5 mol% is suitable, but the invention is of especial benefit in that the amount of DABCO used may be between 0.2 and 1.4 mol%. Normally it will be between 0.5 and 1.4 mol %, typically between 0.8 and 1.2 mol%, for example, about 1 mol%.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention the process is carried out in the presence of about 1 mol% DABCO with methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, isopropyl acetate, A^Af-diwopropylethylamine (Hiinig's base), or A^A/-diniethylformamide as diluent. Most suitably, the diluent is Af Af-dimethylforrnamide. Suitably, the acid acceptor will be potassium carbonate.<br>
When carrying out the process of the invention, the reaction temperature can be varied within a relatively wide range. The temperature chosen will depend on the nature of the solvent or diluent, for example on its boiling point and/or its effectiveness for promoting the desired reaction, and on the speed at which the reaction is to be carried out. In any given solvent or diluent, the reaction will tend to progress more slowly at lower temperatures. In general, the reaction may be carried out at a temperature of from 0 to 120°C, suitably at a<br>
temperature of from 40 to 100°C, and typically at a temperature of from 45 to 95°C, for example, from 60 to 85°C.<br>
For carrying out the process of the invention, from 0.8 to 4 mol, usually from 0.95 to 1.2 rnol, of 2-cyanoph.enol is employed per mol of a compound of formula (II); and similar amounts (0.8 to 4 mol, usually from 0.95 to 1.2 mol) of a compound of formula (IV) are employed per mole of the compound of formula (III).<br>
Conveniently the process of the invention is carried out by mixing one of the components of the reaction, preferably in the presence of a solvent or diluent, with a base. The other component is then added, if appropriate in the presence of a solvent or diluent, and the mixture is stirred, normally at an elevated temperature. The DABCO catalyst may be added at any stage but is preferably added as the last component, as this tends to promote higher product yields. After the reaction is judged to be complete, the reaction mixture is worked up and the product is isolated using conventional techniques well known to a skilled chemist.<br>
2-Cyanophenol is a commercially available material.<br>
The compound of formula (II), where W is the methyl (jE)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group C(CO2CH3)=CHOCH3, and the compound of formula (II) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group C(CO2CH3)CH(OCH3)2, maybe prepared as described in WO 92/08703 from the reaction of 3-(a-methoxy)methylenebenzofuran-2(3J9)~one (derived from benzofuran-2(3.ff)-one) with 4,6-dichloropyrimidine. The compound of formula (II), where W is the methyl (£)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group, may also be prepared by eliminating methanol from (that is, by the demethanolysis of) the compound of formula (If) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, as described in WO 92/08703 or WO 98/07707. The compound of formula (II), where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, may be prepared as described in GB-A-2291874 by reacting a compound of formula (IV), where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, with 4,6-dichloropyrimidine. It may be purified before use by known techniques or may be used in an unpurified state from a previous reaction, for example, in a 'one-pot' reaction.<br>
The compound of formula (IV), where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group, may be prepared as described in GB-A-2291874 from 3-(a-methoxy)methylene-benzofuran-2(3#)-one. The compound of formula (TV), where W is the methyl (E)-2-(3-<br>
methoxy)acrylate group, maybe prepared by the demethano lysis of the compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group. In this case the phenolic group needs to be protected by, for example, benzylation before demethanolysis and then de-protected afterwards.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention includes a process for preparing a compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl (JE)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group, which comprises the steps of:<br>
(i) reacting the compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)~ propanoate group with a reagent that will protect the hydroxyl group of that compound from reaction during subsequent demethanolysis;<br>
(ii) eliminating methanol from the hydroxyl-protected compound formed in step (i); and (iii) removing the hydroxyl-protecting group formed in step (i) to form a compound of . formula (IV) where W is the methyl (£)-2-(3-methoxy)acrylate group.<br>
In step (i) of the process, the compound of formula (IV) where W is the methyl 2-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate group is reacted with a standard protecting reagent, such as a benzyl halide or a substituted benzyl halide [such as a 2-nitrobenzyl halide], for example, benzyl bromide or 2-nitrobenzyl bromide, conveniently in a suitable solvent, such as Af 7V-dimethylforrnamide, and a suitable base, such as potassium carbonate, to form a compound of formula (V):<br>
(Formula V  Removed)<br>
where Q is a protecting group, such as benzyl or 2-nitrobenzyl.<br>
In step (ii) of the process, methanol is eliminated by any suitable physical or chemical means, for example, as described in WO 92/08703 or WO 98/07707. Conveniently, it is eliminated by treating a compound of formula (V) with methanesulphonic acid in the presence of acetic anhydride at a temperature in the range of, for instance, from 20°C to 110°C, typically from 20°C to 80°C and preferably from 30°C to 60°C, for example, at about 40°C.<br>
In step (iii) of the process, the protecting group may be removed by any standard technique for removing protecting groups, for example, by a reduction technique using hydrogen with a 10% palladium/carbon catalyst in ethyl acetate at ambient temperature.<br>
The invention also includes novel intermediates of formula (V) where Q is a protecting group, and particularly the intermediate of formula (V) where Q is benzyl [that is, the compound methyl 2-(2-benzyloxy)phenyl-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate]. More particularly, the invention includes isolated methyl 2-(2-benzyloxy)phenyl-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate in substantially pure form [that is, in an isolated form which comprises from 85 to 100 weight %, preferably from 90 to 100 weight %, of methyl 2-(2-benzyloxy)phenyl-3,3-dimethoxy-propanoatej.<br>

As can be seen, surprisingly, the yield of azoxystrobin formed in the process did not decrease greatly when the DABCO concentration was decreased below 2 mol%: even concentrations of DABCO of as low as O.lmol% were sufficient to give a yield of 93.4% of theory. In addition, it is noted that, not only did the experiment containing no DABCO give a much lower yield, it also required 8 hours to reach this point compared to 5 hours for 0.1 mol% and. 0.2 mol% DABCO and 60 minutes for 1.0 mol% and 2.0 mol% DABCO (in this respect, it is also noted that the experiment containing 1.0 mol% DABCO surprisingly gave the a similar yield in the same time as the experiment containing 2.0 mol% DABCO).<br>

Water (300mls) was charged to the reaction, maintaining the temperature in the range 70-80°C. The mixture was stirred for 40 minutes then settled and the lower aqueous phase separated. The MEBK solution (237.0g) contained methyl (E)-2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate (40.2%w/w) 94.5% of theory.<br>
A summary of the results of these experiments are shown in the following table:<br>

Overall yield in these experiments is not indicative of the yield obtainable with 1.0 mol% DABCO in MIBK as the reactions did not reach completion.<br>
As can be seen, surprisingly, the yield of azoxystrobin recovered from the process was increased when the DABCO was added after the 2-cyanophenol.<br>
It is noted that a comparison of Example 3e (2.0 mol% DABCO) with Examples 3a and 3b (1.0 mol% DABCO) confirms the results already obtained in Example 1 in a different solvent (DMF): the yields for experiments that had gone to completion with 1.0 mol% DABCO, surprisingly, are comparable to yields obtained using 2.0 mol% DABCO.<br>

(Table 4 Removed)<br>
It can be seen from these results that the process of the present invention may also be carried out in an aqueous system. In addition, the surprising result seen in Example 3, with respect to the order of addition ofDABCO, is also seen in the aqueous system - adding DABCO after the 2-cyanophenol (in the form of potassium 2-cyanophenoxide), that is, last, provides a higher yield than adding it before.<br>
Example 5<br>
The preparation of methyl (E)-2-(2-hvdroxyphenvl)-3-(methoxv)acrylate.<br>
Step 1: The preparation of methyl 2-[(2-benzyloxy)phenyl]-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate.<br>
Crude methyl 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3-(dimethoxy)propanoate (15g), DMF (82g) and potassium carbonate 8.7g were agitated at room temperature and benzyl bromide (9.8g) added over 15 minutes. After 6 hours a further charge of benzyl bromide (l.Og) was added. After stirring overnight, water (200ml) was added. The solid which formed was isolated by suction filtration, washed with water and sucked dry on the filter to give methyl 2-[(2-benzyloxy)phenyl]-(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate(57%).<br>
Step 2: The preparation of methyl (E)-2-(2-benzyloxy)phenyl-3-methoxyacrylate.<br>
A solution of methyl 2-[(2-benzyloxy)phenyl]~(3,3-dimethoxy)propanoate (5g; from Step 1) in acetic anhydride (7.0g) was heated to 40°C and methanesulphonic acid (0.33g) added. After 90 minutes the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and toluene (25ml) was added. The resulting solution was washed with water (3x75ml) and then the toluene was evaporated in vacua to give a liquid. After standing overnight crystals formed. These were isolated by filtration. A second crop was isolated from the filtrates after further concentration and trituration with ethanol. The combined yield of methyl (E)-2-(2-benzyloxy)phenyl-3-methoxyacrylate was 44%.<br>
Step 3: The preparation of methyl (E)-2-(2-hydroxy)phenyl-3-rnethoxyacrylate.<br>
Ethyl acetate (25ml) was degassed by application of vacuum and purged with nitrogen. Methyl (E&gt;2-(2-benzyloxy)phenyl-3-methoxyacrylate (0.8g) and palladium on charcoal (0.02g) was added in ethyl acetate (10ml). The nitrogen atmosphere was replace by hydrogen and the reaction allowed to stir at ambient temperature. After approximately 40 hours the catalyst was filtered off and the reaction re-started with fresh catalyst (0.02g). After 2 hours the reaction was complete. The reaction flask was purged with nitrogen. The catalyst was filtered, washed with ethyl acetate and the combined filtrates and washes evaporated under vacuum to give methyl (£)-2-(2-hydroxy)phenyl-3-methoxyacrylate as an oil, which crystallised on standing.<br>
