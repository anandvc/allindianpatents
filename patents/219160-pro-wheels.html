This invention is a simple assembly which provides a permanent solution for the problems faced by a two wheeler driver when his bike is subjected to a puncture.<br>
If the rear wheel of a bike is subjected to a puncture, the wheel has to be removed from the bike in order to fix the puncture. Hence the vehicle has to be parked, wheel has to be removed and puncture has to be fixed. This consumes lot of time and lot of money, as time is money nowadays.<br>
The present invention provides a permanent solution for the above said problem, by having a simply assembly fixed to the bike, called Pro-Wheels.<br>
Brief Description of the drawings:<br>
The invention is best described with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 Shows the preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
Fig.2 Illustrates the Columns.<br>
Fig.3 Illustrated the Shaft.<br>
Fig.4 Illustrates the Resistor plate.<br>
Fig 5. Illustrates the exploded view of the assembly<br>
Fig.6 Pictorial representation of the assembly.<br>
Description of the Parts:<br>
Column:<br>
The column AB as shown in Fig.2 is of 365mm in length, which may vary according to the make of the vehicle. At a distance of 5mm from A, hole H1 of diameter (15mm to 25mm) is drilled. This hole Hi may also vary according to the make of the vehicle. Exactly I5mm from the center of hole H1, a slot CD of 120x6 mm in dimension is cut. At end B, hole H2 of diameter 25.4 mm is drilled. Exactly 75mm from the center of hole H2, two slots EF and GH are cut to a dimension of 25.4x3 mm. These two slots are 20mm apart.<br><br>
Hole H1 varies for different makes of the vehicle based on rear axle diameter of the vehicle. Hole H2 is of standard dimension independent of the make of the vehicle. It is where the shaft is connected to the column with the help of a bearing. Bearing 629 ZZ is housed in the column at hole H2, which is connected to the shaft. Slot CD is where the resistor slides. Slots EF and GH are provided to lock the assembly to the saree guard, when it is not in use. It is locked with the help of a strap. The length of the column will vary for different makes of the vehicle, and corresponding changes will be made to suit the application.<br>
Shaft:<br>
The Shaft (Fig.3 AB) is of 14mm in diameter and the length of which is completely dependent on the length of the rear center of axle of the bike. Again, this length may vary according to the make of the vehicle. At end A, the shaft is turned to a diameter of 10mm for a length of 15mm. This portion is used to attach the column with the help of a 1 inch bearing. Six holes of 3mm diameter are drilled on the shaft. Hole CHI and CH6 is drilled exactly 4mm from either end of the shaft AB. Hole CH2 is drilled at a distance of 18.5mm from A and hole CH3 is at 38mm from hole CH2. Hole CH4 is drilled at a distance 95mm from hole CH3 and hole CH5 is at 38 mm from hole CH4.<br>
The distance between hole CH3 and hole CH4 is again dependent on the width of the rear wheel of the bike. During the assembly is mounted and engaged for use, there may some small axial movements of the small wheels. These holes CH2, CH3, CH4 and CHS are drilled in which the cotter pins will be employed in order to prevent such small movements. For additional support the cotter pins are also employed at the holes CHI and CH6.<br><br>
Resistor:<br>
The resistor plate in Fig 4 is of 120x25x5 mm in dimension. There are two small block of iron of dimension 8x25x8 mm is welded to the plate. As shown in Fig.4, the block CD is welded 31mm from point A and block EF at 40mm from point B, leaving a 33mm gap between the blocks. This 33 mm gap minus the column width of 31.75mm gives 1.25mm of clearance for the resistor plate to slide freely on the column. A hole Rl of diameter 6mm is drilled exactly at the center of this 33 mm gap where a lock nut is employed to lock the resistor plate at the desired position over the slot on the column. This further prevents the angular displacement of the assembly due to any shock to the small wheels while they are in use.<br>
Few extra blocks (GH Fig.4.1) may be welded to the resistor plate in order to suit the different makes of the vehicle as shown in Fig 4.1. These blocks will perform the same function of resisting the angular movement of the assembly due to any shock to the small wheels.<br>
Wheels:<br>
The wheels employed in the assembly are with the dimensions of 100 mm in diameter with width of 26 mm (Standard Available Size). The Wheel constitutes an outer layer of rubber to 10 mm thickness, which allows free rotation of wheels when in contact with the ground The wheel prescribed use may not be limited to the design specified by any standard wheel to the purpose can be used along in the design.<br>
Bearing:<br>
A 629 ZZ Bearing, which is housed in the column, is used to couple the Shaft to the Column. The bearing is employed to minimize the load on the shaft. The addition of the bearing is to ensure the Free rotation of the shaft and to absorb the load the if any from the colunm not to hinder the rotation of the shaft. Hence ensuring the free movement of the vehicle when the vehicle is pushed by the user.<br><br>
Description of the Invention:<br>
Pro- Wheels is a simple assembly of two columns fitted to either end of a shaft, on which two wheels are mounted. The column is coupled to the shaft with the help of bearings.<br>
There are two columns CI and C2 coupled with the shaft with the help of bearings. Two small wheels Wl and W2 will be mounted on the shaft and cotter pins are employed at the respective 3mm holes. The resistor plate is fitted to the resistor slot such that it can slide over the entire length of 120mm. It is designed in such a way that the resistor plate can be locked at any desired position of the slot. Now Pro-Wheels parts are assembled and that the assembly is ready for use.<br>
Ihe top end of the columns is coupled to the rear center axle of the bike. This is just a one time fitting by unscrewing the nut at both the ends of the axle, removing the axle and placing the columns at the right position and then again fixing the axle. Tightening the nuts of the axle will hold the assembly in the desired position, but for added assurance a resistor plate is provided which slides on the resistor slot, where the assembly can be clocked to a desired angle and can be locked using the resistor plate.<br>
When the assembly is not in use, it can be clocked to a desired angle between 0-30 degrees and can be locked using the resistor plate. For added convenience, a Velcro strap is provided along with the unit where the assembly can be strapped to the saree guard of the bike using the slots EF and GH on the column.<br>
1 he shaft, which is coupled to the column with the help of bearing consists of 6 holes, CHI, CH2, CH3, CH4, CHS and CH6 in Fig 3. When the assembly is in use, there are some chances of axial movement of the small wheels on the shaft due to bad road conditions. In order to prevent that cotter pins are employed on these small holes thereby preventing any axial movement of the small wheels.<br><br>
The assembly which is at rest (say 30 degrees) can be given a clockwise angular displacement of about 120 degrees (having the column at 6'o clock position). This is achieved by loosening the nut of the rear center axle of the bike where the column is pivoted. Placing the assembly at the 6'o clock position, first slide the resistor plate upwards towards the center axle and lock it up where further its movement on the slot is hindered. Then tighten the nuts on both the sides of the center axle. Now the assembly is ready for use.<br>
Once the rear wheel of the bike gets punctured, the user can deploy the Pro-wheels as said above and can push the bike to the nearby puncture workshop without any worries of leaving his family on the way, or leaving his bike on the way or worrying about the damage that will be caused to the tube which is inside the tyre of the bike. After fixing the puncture, the assembly can again be deflected back to the 2'o clock position and is available at any time to protect you and your bike's wheels at the time of puncture. Hence Pro-Wheels.<br>
Pro-Wheels comprising a simple assembly of column (2), which has a resistor slot (1), coupled to the shaft(3) with the bearing(4) and wheels(5) mounted on the shaft, where in the column is pivoted to the center axle of the rear wheel of the Bike, and the resistor plate which slides over the resistor slot.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
