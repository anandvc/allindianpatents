				<td>"USE OF MoO3 AS CORROSION INHIBITOR, AND COATING COMPOSITION CONTAINING SUCH AN INHIBITOR"<br>
The object of the present invention is to develop an anti-corrosion coating for metal parts, preferably a coating free of hexavalent chromium, which is endowed with improved antircorrosion properties.<br>
The invention applies to metal parts of any type, in particular made of steel or cast iron, which need to have good corrosion behaviour, for example because of their application in the motor-vehicle industry. The geometry of the parts to be treated is of little importance as long as the anti-corrosion compositions may be applied by reliable and industrializable processes.<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is in particular to improve the anti-corrosion properties of parts treated without using a composition based on hexavalent chromium in the formulation of the coatings.<br>
Many anti-corrosion treatment solutions based on' hexavalent chromium have been proposed to date. Although they are generally satisfactory with regard to the protection of treated metal parts, they are, however, becoming increasingly criticized because of their consequences with regard to the toxic risks that they entail and in particular because of their adverse consequences for the environment.<br>
As a consequence, various anti-corrosion treatment compositions free of hexavalent chromium have been recommended. Some of these compositions are based on a particular metal, such as zinc or aluminium. However, when such compositions are in the form of an aqueous dispersion their stability is limited. This precludes long preservation and storage times.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the Applicant has discovered that it is possible to improve the anti-corrosion properties and the stability of various anti-corrosion coating compositions by incorporating thereinto molybdenum oxide Mo03 as corrosion inhibitor.<br>
Hitherto, the use of molybdenum oxide MoO3 as a corrosion inhibitor in systems of aqueous phase has not been known. Certain molybdates, i.e. Mo042~ ions, have already been presented as corrosion inhibitors. However, the Applicant has been able to show that in a certain number of conventional anti-corrosion compositions the addition of a molybdate, for example zinc molybdate, in no way improves it's properties.<br>
The present invention relates more particularly to the use of molybdenum oxide Mo03 as an agent for enhancing the anti-corrosion properties of a coating composition based on a particulate metal containing zinc or a zinc alloy in aqueous phase. This finding has even been extended to composition containing hexavalent chromium. This is another object of the invention.<br>
Without in any way wishing to be limited to such an interpretation, it seems that in the particular case of an anti-corrosion coating composition based on a particulate metal, the presence of molybdenum oxide Mo03 makes it possible to improve the control of the sacrificial protection exerted by the particulate metal in suspension in the composition.<br>
According to one particular feature, the particulate metals have a lamellar form, the thickness of the flakes being comprised between 0,05 /xm and I ]Ltm and having a diameter equivalent (D50) measured by laser diffraction comprised between 5 pm and 25 /xm the subject of the invention is more particularly the use of molybdenum oxide Mo03 in a composition containing zinc in aqueous phase.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the molybdenum<br>
oxide Mo03 is used in an essentially pure or tho rhombic crystalline form, having a molybdenum content greater than approximately 60% by mass.<br>
Advantageously, the molybdenum oxide Mo03 will be used in the ant i-corros ion compositions in the form of particles having dimensions of between 1 and 200 p.m.<br>
More specifically, the subject of the present invention is anti-corrosion coating compositions for metal parts, which comprise:<br>
at least one particulate metal;<br>
an organic solvent;<br>
a thickener;<br>
a  silane-based  binder,  preferably  carrying  epoxy functional groups;<br>
molybdenum oxide (Mo03) ;<br>
possibly a silicate of sodium, potassium or lithium,<br>
and ,-<br>
water.<br>
The relative proportions of the various constituents in such a composition may vary widely. However, it has ,â€¢ turned out that the content of molybdenum oxide MoO3 is preferably between 0.5 and 7% and even more preferably in the region of 2% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The particulate metal present in the composition may be chosen from zinc, aluminium, chromium, manganese, nickel, titanium, their alloys and intermetallic compounds, and mixtures thereof. It should be pointed out here that if the recommended coating composition is preferably free of CrVI, it may nevertheless contain a certain proportion of metallic chromium. In practice, it has turned out that the presence of zinc is highly desirable.<br>
Advantageously, the particulate metal content is between 10% and 40% by weight of metal with respect to the weight of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the anti-corrosion coating composition according to the invention contains zinc and/or aluminium, and preferably comprises zinc.<br>
As indicated above, this type of composition is mainly of aqueous nature and therefore preferably contains from 30% to 60% by weight of water. The composition may nevertheless be enriched by the presence of an organic solvent, preferably a water-soluble organic solvent, which makes it possible to improve the anti-corrosion performance of the composition. For this purpose, the composition will contain, for example, from 1% to 30% by weight with respect to the total composition. However, it seems to be important not to exceed this organic solvent content of approximately 30%.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the composition will make use of an organic solvent, for example consisting of a glycol ether, in particular diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and dipropylene glycol.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, the<br>
anti-corrosion composition also contains from 0.00,5% to 2% by<br>
weight of a thickening agent, in particular of a cellulose<br>
derivative,    more   particularly   hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, xanthan gum or an associative thickener of the polyurethane or acrylic type.<br>
The composition of the present invention may also contain mineral rheologic agents of the silica or organophilic clays type.<br>
Such a composition also makes use of a binder, preferably an organofunctional silane, used in an amount of 3% to 20% by weight. The organofunctionality can be represented by vinyl, methacryloxy and amino, but is preferably epoxy functional for enhanced coating performance as well as composition stability. The silane is advantageously easily dispersible in<br>
aqueous medium, and is preferably soluble in such medium. Preferably, the useful silane is an epoxy functional silane such as beta- (3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyltrimethoxysilane, 4(trimethoxysilyl) butane-1,2 epoxide or y-glycidoxypropyl-trimethoxysilane.<br>
Finally, the anti-corrosion coating compositions according to the invention may also contain, in addition to the aforementioned organic solvent, up to a maximum amount of approximately .10% by weight of white spirit so as to improve the ability of the anti-corrosion compositions to be applied<br>
to the metal parts by spraying, dipping or dip-spinning.<br>
/<br>
Advantageously, the composition may also contain a silicate of sodium, potassium or lithium, preferably in an amount comprised between 0,05 % to 0,5 % by weight.<br>
Naturally, the present invention also relates to anti-corrosion coatings which are applied to the metal parts using the aforementioned compositions, being applied by spraying, spinning or dip-spinning followed by a curing operation at a temperature of between 70Â°C and 350Â°C for a cure time of around 30 minutes.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the anti-corrosion coating will result from an application operation involving, prior to the curing operation, an operation of drying the coated metal parts, preferably at a temperature of around 70Â°C for approximately 20 minutes. Under these conditions, the thickness of the coating thus applied is between 3 /zm and 15 iim and preferably between 5 /zm and 10 /zm.<br>
In the examples presented hereinbelow for comparative purposes, various types of corrosion inhibitor were tested within the context of the present study, which was carried out in order to improve the anti-corrosion properties of various compositions and in particular of the reference composition called GEOMETÂ® which has been described in<br>
US 5 868 819 herein incorporated by reference.<br>

To carry out the various comparative experiments on the aforementioned inhibitors, different baths were obtained by adding 1 g of inhibitor to 9 ml of water, the dispersion being maintained for 1 hour, then the mixture was added to 90 g of the aforementioned standard GEOMETÂ® composition and then stirred for 3 hours.<br>
The first layer of this composition to be tested was	applied<br>
using a No, 38 Conway bar. The drying was carried out	at 70Â°C<br>
for approximately 20 minutes and then the curing was	carried<br>
out at 300Â°C for approximately 30 minutes.<br>
The second layer was applied using an identical protocol.<br>
The panels thus treated were then tested in a salt spray. The salt spray resistance results for the various coatings tested are given in the table below.<br>

In addition, the more particular salt spray resistance results as a function of the age of the bath, and therefore of its stability at 4Â°C and 20Â°C respectively, are given in the appended Figures 1 and 2 .<br>
Both these figures show very clearly that, in each case, on the one hand, the anti-corrosion performance of the composition containing molybdenum oxide MoO3 is markedly improved and that, on the other hand, the ant i- corrosion performance is maintained better over time when molybdenum oxide is added to the composition.<br>

It should be noted that the molybdenum oxide powder was each time introduced into the GEOMETÂ® or DACROMETÂ® bath by dusting. The bath was homogenized by stirring using a dispersive blade at 450 revolutions per minute.<br>
The anti-corrosion compositions tested were applied to 10 cm x 20 cm cold rolled low carbon steel panels by coating using the Conway bar, followed by predrying at 70Â°C during about 20 minutes, and then cured in an oven at 300Â°C for 30 minutes.<br>
In the case of application to screws, the compositions were applied by dip-spinning and then cured under the same conditions as for the panels.<br>
The observed salt spray resistance results according to the ISO 9227 standard are given schematically in the following table:<br>
(TABLE Remove)<br><br><br>
* Number of hours of exposure to salt spray before red rust appears .<br>
** grams per square meter of coated surface, the thickness of the coatings are comprised between approximately about and about<br>
It is therefore apparent that introducing molybdenum oxide Mo03 into compositions in aqueous phase, GEOMETÂ® or DACROMETÂ®<br><br>
containing  particulate  zinc,  improves  the  salt resistance of the said compositions very substantially.<br><br>
spray<br><br>
Another aspect of the invention consists in adding an alkaline silicate to the composition in an amount comprised between 0,05 % to 0,5 % by weight.<br>
The  addition  of  alkaline  silicate,  for  example  sodium<br>
silicate, surprisingly enhances the film cohesion in a worthy way.<br>
This is particularly illustrated in the following comparative example given in Table 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In this example, the cohesion is evaluated by applying a transparent adhesive paper on the coating surface and by quick pulling off. The cohesion is evaluated according to a scale from 0 (complete pulling off of the c6ating film) to 5 (no pulling off at all of the coating film).<br>

The composition is applied onto steel panels which have previously been degreased, with a Conway rod, in order to obtain a weight of a coating layer of 30 g/m2. The plates are then cured under the same conditions as previously described.<br>
They are then submitted to the salt spray test according to ISO 9227 and to the cohesion test. The results are shown in following Table 6".<br>
