				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Method and apparatus for manufacturing a thin-walled<br>
article<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufac-<br>
turing a thin-walled article, wherein a single- or<br>
multi-component, essentially polymer-based material,<br>
such as plastics, elastomers, and/or the like, is<br>
sprayed in an elecrical field in an electrically<br>
charged state.<br>
At present, it is conventional to employ so-called<br>
electrostatic coating e.g. in automotive painting.<br>
This application is generally carried out by using<br>
metal-based coating materials, whose electrical charge<br>
and spraying in an electrical field can be achieved in<br>
the discussed application in a sufficiently homo-<br>
geneous manner, such that the automobile is provided<br>
all over with a sufficiently thick layer of paint.<br>
However, the above type processing is inconvenient to<br>
carry out in practice with a sufficient reliability,<br>
especially when used in connection with plastic-based<br>
materials because of a poor applicability of this type<br>
of materials to the discussed processing. On the other<br>
hand, it is perfectly well known to provide the<br>
plastics to be sprayed with an electrical charge by<br>
using suitable polarity/resistivity regulating mate-<br>
rials, such as chlorine-/glycol-based materials or the<br>
like. Despite this, however, this type of electrical<br>
processing of a plastic material has not been possible<br>
to perform thus far with a sufficient reliability,<br>
which is why e.g. conventional thin-walled ordinary<br>
articles, such as gloves, condoms or the like, must<br>
still be manufactured largely by using a traditional<br>
dip process.<br>
On the other hand, the International patent publicati-<br>
on WO 94/22594 discloses a process for coating espe-<br>
cially objects with varying shapes, which is based on<br>
the fact that a multi-component material, one comp-<br>
rising a cold curing and inert, e.g. solvent-free<br>
resin, is electrostatically applied to a surface of an<br>
object, whereafter at least one fluid material is<br>
sprayed onto the resin before it has cured.<br>
The cited publication does not present any concrete<br>
solution for performing the above-described task, as<br>
it mostly discloses various alternative working<br>
principles for providing a coating. On the basis of<br>
technology described in the cited publication, it is<br>
not possible in practice to make sure that especially<br>
a flow of resin-based, electrically processible<br>
material be applied particularly to a multi-dimen-<br>
sionally shaped article in such a way that the direct<br>
result of a spraying cycle would be a finished end<br>
product immediately after its removal from the mould<br>
or that each area/point of the article would be<br>
provided with an exactly desired material thickness,<br>
which hence remains to be a central problem, especial-<br>
ly in terms of electrically processing plastic-based<br>
materials.<br>
An object of this intention is to provide a decisive<br>
remedy for the above-described problems and hence to<br>
raise substantially the available prior art. In order<br>
to achieve this object, a method of the invention is<br>
principally characterized in, that the thin-walled<br>
article is manufactured in an electrical field by<br>
spraying an electrically charged material into the<br>
contact with a mould set at an electric potential,<br>
after which spraying cycle the article is, at least in<br>
terms of its appearance, immediately a finished<br>
product after its removal/separation from the mould.<br>
The method of the invention offers some major advanta-<br>
ges, including e.g. its technical functionality and<br>
applicability, by virtue of which it is practically<br>
for the first time possible to provide a sufficiently<br>
reliable result in most diversified applications, even<br>
when using a plastic-based manufacturing material in<br>
connection with the above type of electrical proces-<br>
sing. Usefulness of the method is based on the fact<br>
that, in principle, a single spraying cycle is suffi-<br>
cient for manufacturing even a completely finished end<br>
product, which does not necessarily require any<br>
finishing operations when using properly blended<br>
process materials, regarding e.g. colouring or other<br>
mechanical/physical characteristics, such as surface<br>
tension, surface strength, colouring, or the like.<br>
When applying the method of the invention in a prefer-<br>
red fashion, it is also possible to manufacture<br>
articles, whose wall thickness is intentionally made<br>
in certain areas different from other areas. Further-<br>
more, the method of the invention can be applied in a<br>
traditional manner, e.g. in a so.-called electrostatic<br>
fashion, such that, according to an application<br>
preferably utilized in the method, the predetermined<br>
voltage levels in the various treatment blocks of a<br>
mould included therein are maintained substantially<br>
constant through the entire spraying cycle. On the<br>
other hand, it is also possible in this connection to<br>
utilize a dynamically controlled spraying process,<br>
such that one or more process parameters are changed<br>
continuously or periodically and/or that the mould is<br>
moved during the spraying cycle.<br>
Preferred applications for the method of the invention<br>
are set forth in the non-independent claims directed<br>
to a method.<br>
The invention relates also to an apparatus operating<br>
in accordance with the method, which is defined in<br>
more detail in the preamble of the independent claim<br>
directed to the same. The principally characterizing<br>
features of the apparatus are set forth in the charac-<br>
terizing clause of said claim.<br>
The most important advantages offered by the apparatus<br>
of the invention include technical reliability in its<br>
operation and function. Another advantage offered by<br>
the apparatus of the invention is that a mould inclu-<br>
ded therein, which is removable/separable from an<br>
article to be manufactured and which is either negati-<br>
ve and/or positive, depending on a given article to be<br>
manufactured, renders it possible to manufacture most<br>
diverse products. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
appratus, it is also possible to utilize treatment<br>
blocks, included in the mould and to be set at voltage<br>
levels different from each other, the voltage levels<br>
mathematically predetermined therein effecting in the<br>
actual spraying process a totally controlled flow of<br>
material to the wall of a given target being trea-<br>
ted/manufactured, e.g. for enabling the very above-<br>
mentioned fluctuations in material thickness. Depen-<br>
ding on an article to be processed, it is also possi-<br>
ble to provide the apparatus with a control unit,<br>
operating in principle e.g. according to a tradi-<br>
tional, i.e. e.g. in a so-called electrostatic manner,<br>
such that the predetermined voltage levels in the<br>
treatment blocks of a mould are substantially constant<br>
through the entire spraying cycle. On the other hand,<br>
it is also possible to make said control unit dynami-<br>
cal, such that certain process parameters are changed<br>
continuously or with an on/off principle during the<br>
spraying cycle.<br>
Preferred embodiments for the apparatus of the inven-<br>
tion are set forth in the non-independent claims<br>
directed to an apparatus.<br>
In the following specification, the invention will be<br>
described in more detail with reference made to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which<br>
fig. 1 shows the operating principle for a method<br>
and an apparatus of the invention, and<br>
fig. 2 shows by way of example a mould useful in<br>
connection with a method and an apparatus of<br>
the invention.<br>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a<br>
thin-walled article, wherein a single- or multi-<br>
component, essentially polymer-based material 1, such<br>
as plastics, elastomers, and/or the like, is sprayed<br>
in an elecrical field E in an electrically charged<br>
state. The thin-walled article is manufactured in the<br>
electrical field E by spraying II an electrically<br>
charged I material into the contact with a mould 2 set<br>
at an electric potential, after which spraying cycle<br>
II the article is, at least in terms of its appearan-<br>
ce, immediately a finished product after its remo-<br>
val/separation from the mould 2.<br>
In a further preferred application of the method, a<br>
three-dimensional, thin-walled article is manufactured<br>
by spraying a manufacturing material in the electrical<br>
field E to an open mould 2 set at an electric poten-<br>
tial, in yet another preferred application of the<br>
method, the surface of said mould 2 is treated with<br>
surface-tension regulating surfactants, such as a<br>
silico-ne-, a polyolefine-based and/or a corresponding<br>
agent, especially for facilitating the removal/separa-<br>
tion of a finished article from the mould 2. In a<br>
further preferred application, the surface tension of<br>
a material to be sprayed is adjusted relative to the<br>
surface tension of a mould to a level that results in<br>
a uniform, thin material thickness.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred application of the method,<br>
said method is used for manufacturing an elastic<br>
product, such as a garment, a condom, or e.g. a glove<br>
just as shown in fig. 2, by spraying II the manufactu-<br>
ring material 1 in the electrical field E to the open<br>
mould 2 set at an electric potential.<br>
In still another preferred application of the method,<br>
especially in reference to the operating principle<br>
depicted in fig. 1, the manufacturing material 1 is<br>
heated by the action of a heating unit 01, whereafter<br>
ingredients 1a, 1b of the multi-component manufactu-<br>
ring material are mixed together 02, the manufacturing<br>
material 1 is charged electrically I and sprayed II by<br>
the action of a processing unit 4, such as a spray<br>
bell or the like.<br>
In a preferred application, a desired wall thickness<br>
for the article to be manufactured is achieved at any<br>
given point by providing the mould 2 with two or more<br>
treatment blocks Li, which can be set at voltage<br>
levels substantially different from each other, e.g.<br>
by applying the principle shown in fig. 2.<br>
In yet another preferred application of the method,<br>
the article is manufactured by using two or more<br>
processing units 4, essentially facing each other, by<br>
moving the mould 2 in the spraying situation II,<br>
and/or by changing, during the spraying cycle II, one<br>
or more process parameters, such as the volume flow,<br>
viscosity and/or the like of a manufacturing material<br>
or a component thereof, and/or the electrical field E,<br>
such as the voltage level in one or more treatment<br>
blocks Li of the mould.<br>
First of all, the above type application of the method<br>
is based on the fact that a given target to be<br>
processed, e.g. a glove as just depicted in fig. 2, is<br>
previously modelled and this is used as a basis for<br>
determining calculated or so-called tabulated optimal<br>
voltage levels for each critical point/area of a<br>
target, such that the unequal voltage levels esta-<br>
blished in these areas serve either to boost or<br>
suppress the electrical field during the actual<br>
spraying II for a controlled management of the flows<br>
of material. The discussed mould can be quite simply<br>
assembled by using of wires or the like electrically<br>
conducting surfaces appropriately included in each<br>
treatment block.<br>
The apparatus operating in accordance with the above-<br>
described method comprises, unlike the traditional<br>
solutions, especially a mould 2 which can be set at an<br>
electric potential and which is removable/separable<br>
from an article that is formed after spraying II an<br>
electrically charged flow of material to the mould 2<br>
and that is a finished product at least in terms of<br>
its appearance.<br>
Particularly in reference to the basic operating<br>
sketch shown in fig. 1, the apparatus comprises a<br>
heating unit 01 intended for heating basic ingredients<br>
1a, 1b pressurized by means of cylinders S, and a<br>
processing unit 4, such as a spray bell or the like,<br>
for mixing 02 said ingredients together, for charging<br>
the same electrically I, and for producing a material<br>
spray II from the prepared manufacturing material 1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus comprises a<br>
mould 2, including two or more treatment blocks Li<br>
whose voltage levels can be set to essentially differ<br>
from each other, and/or a control unit C for changing,<br>
during the spraying cycle II, one or more process<br>
parameters, such as the volume flow, viscosity, and/or<br>
the like of a manufacturing material or a component<br>
thereof, and/or the electrical field E, such as the<br>
voltage level in one or more treatment blocks Li of<br>
the mould 2.<br>
It is obvious that the invention is not limited to the<br>
above-described or explained applications, but it can<br>
be subjected to major modifications within the scope<br>
of the basic inventional concept. Thus, it is natural-<br>
ly clear that the method of the invention can be<br>
utilized in a type of operation discussed in more<br>
detail in the Applicant's co-pending patent applicati-<br><br>
on/"Method and apparatus for electrically controlling<br>
a flow of material". Moreover, it is naturally obvious<br>
that the method and apparatus of the invention can be<br>
used for manufacturing rigid three-dimensional arti-<br>
cles as well as naturally also similar elastic pro-<br>
ducts. In practical processing, the voltage level of<br>
the apparatus can be chosen to serve any given purpose<br>
the best possible way but, in principle, the type of<br>
equipment tested by the Applicant with a maximum<br>
voltage of about 100 kV is capable of achieving a<br>
sufficiently good end result in a wide variety of<br>
processes.<br>
