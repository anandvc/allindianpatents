GARMENT WITH INTEGRATED SENSOR SYSTEM<br>
In a number of illnesses or situations, it is expedient to continuously monitor the particular person or patient for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The monitoring involves cardiac functions of respiration, skin resistance, transpiration, body temperature and the like. Depending on the type of illness or situation being monitored, a differing mix of parameters will be advisable. The measurement should be done continuously over a long period of time, and not just for a few minutes. This requires that the sensors placed on the body not significantly impair the comfort and the normal freedom of movement.<br>
Situations in which monitoring of the vital parameters is necessary can occur during any phase of life. For example, in medically warranted cases one must detect irregular breathing or heart defects or support rehabilitation procedures (care of the elderly, telemedicine, etc.). In work safety situations, monitoring is necessary to preclude overexertion or unacceptable risk. In fitness, sports or wellness applications, one can keep a record of the training results or support the training by means of a monitoring.<br>
Infants and small children are especially difficult to monitor, as they have pronounced motor activity. In any case, the sensors must be held in constant contact with the body to preclude measurement errors. On the other hand, the electrical leads of the sensors must not present any danger to the person or the small patient being monitored.<br>
Given the above, the problem of the invention is therefore to create an arrangement by which a sensor can be fixed in correct position on a human body.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention by the garment with the features of Claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, a garment is used whose material can stretch in at least one direction. Thanks to the stretching ability, movement is relatively unimpaired and, on the other hand, the stretching ability ensures that the sensors remain in adequate contact with the body. The tailoring is such that the garment, when placed on the body, remains fixed in proper position.<br>
The garment contains at least one sensor for detecting a vital function, such as skin resistance, transpiration, respiration, pulse, action currents of the heart, body temperature and the like. The sensors put out an electric signal, which is either an unmodified input electric signal, or they serve as an interface for diverting the electric currents of the body into a measuring instrument.<br><br>
2<br>
For this, moreover, a connection cable, which is led out from the garment and secured inside the garment, is specified.<br>
It is especially advisable for the garment to be a so-called body suit, enclosing the chest and abdomen, and provided with a neck cutout and two arm cutouts, as well as leg cutouts.<br>
To facilitate the dressing of an infant or small child with such a body suit, the body suit can be opened in the lengthwise direction.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous for the body suit to have a crotch piece tailored as one piece with the garment, running across the crotch.<br>
In particular, and again for infants and small children, it is advantageous to provide the body suit with sleeves, so that it serves not only to carry the sensors, but also forms a complete garment, protecting the body from getting a chill.<br>
However, it is also possible to configure the garment as a vest, in the manner of a T-shirt or of an undershirt with straps.<br>
If the material of the garment is elastically stretchable in all directions, the garment can be adapted very well to the shape of the wearer without causing significant constraint or folding when the wearer is moving.<br>
In very favorable manner, these requirements are fulfilled when the material is a multilayered woven fabric. The multilayered woven fabric is preferably a knitted fabric, which in itself provides the necessary elasticity. The material for the knitted fabric can be ordinary cotton, possibly containing spandex threads to a slight degree, such as less than 5%. The cotton threads substantially improve the wearing comfort. Rayon, synthetic or microfibers can be used and can substantially broaden the function of the textile in some situations, as they have a climate control action, alleviating skin complaints such as neurodermitis or the like.<br>
The sensors can be such as alter their resistance value when stretched. Preferably, the specific resistance of the sensor is 25 ohm cm, or the value can lie in a range between 5 ohm cm and 30 kohm cm, while any region lying within this range is also claimed as a newly defined region.<br>
With such a type of stretching-dependent sensor, the original electric signal is modified, since the current flowing through the sensor is increased or decreased according to the resistance value. When the sensor is supplied with constant current, rather than the current it is the voltage drop which is altered, so that this is to be understood as the signal.<br>
The stretching-dependent sensor can be created by using a nonconductive elastomeric base material in which conductive particles are embedded. The conductive particles can be carbon particles or conductive metal particles, i.e., metal particles which have not formed a nonconductive skin on their surface by oxidation or do not form such within a very short time, even when embedded in the elastomer.<br><br>
3<br>
Another form of a stretching-dependent sensor is based on a hydrogel.<br>
The elastomer is preferably a skin-tolerated elastomer, which at least for the most part is nonallergenic. This condition is of special importance only in the case of a sensor worn directly on the skin, such as sensors or electrodes for tapping the action currents of the heart or measuring the skin resistance.<br>
Advisedly, the elastomer can stretch more than the substrate on which the sensor is found. In this way, the stretching capacity oi'the sensor will not restrict that of the substrate, in this case, the garment or part of the garment. Suitable materials for the substrate are fluoroelastomers, polyurethanes or silicone.<br>
Depending on the application, it can be advantageous to provide the sensor with a preferably stretchable insulating layer on at least one side. This can be, for example, an intermediate layer, between the actual active surface and the substrate in the form of the garment, or it can be an insulating layer between the active part of the sensor and the skin, in the case of elongation sensors.<br>
So that moisture does not influence the measurement signal in the case of elongation sensors, the active layer of these sensors is advisedly surrounded on all sides by insulating layers.<br>
In any case, the insulating layers can consist of the same base material as the active layers.<br>
In order to derive the electrical signals, the sensor is hooked up by at least one lead wire. In the case of elongation sensors, of course, two lead wires are necessary.<br>
Good electrical signals are obtained in the case of elongation sensors when the elongation sensor is configured as a web, i.e., the transverse dimension is small relative to the longitudinal dimension. The sensitivity can be even farther enhanced if the web of the sensor runs at least once in a U-shape, while a Z-shape is also considered a multiple U-shape. In this way, the longitudinal extent of the elongation sensor can be shorter as compared to an elongation sensor that has only one web in the longitudinal direction and the same sensitivity.<br>
In the case of sensors for tapping the action currents of the heart, which basically serve only as contact surfaces, a two-dimensional configuration on the side facing the body is advantageous. The shape can be round or angular, depending on the requirements. One should achieve a large contact surface without producing elongations that significantly influence the resistance value of the sensor.<br>
The sensor must be so flexible and drapable as to conform well to the body surface. The surface can be smooth or structured. The structure can be composed of pyramids or tetrahedra, so that sweat can be more easily drained from it. The tips increase the local contact pressure on the skin and thus create a better local skin contact. However, the structure should not be too<br><br>
4<br>
pronounced, as this would result in permanent damaging of the skin and an unpleasant feeling when worn.<br>
The sensor should consist of a material that is not sensitive to body sweat and transpiration. This insensitivity should exist for at least the surface layers, provided they can adequately protect the core.<br>
So that the sensor does not impair the cleaning of the garment and/or its disinfection and/or sterilization, the sensor should consist of materials that are wash-resistant under normal conditions, to allow easy care, hot-water-fast to allow extensive disinfection, or even heat-resistant enough to withstand sterilization in an autoclave.<br>
In order to keep the sensor in the closest possible contact with the body, the sensor can be placed in or on an at least partially stretchable belt, preferably an elastically stretchable belt. The belt can be a flat-lying tube. The tube can be created as a plain or hosiery tube knit. This has the advantage that no seams occur, which would impair the wearing comfort, for example, by rubbing against the skin, or impair the stretchability.<br>
Furthermore,! the tubelike belt can accommodate and protect the sensor, as long as no direct skin contact is required.<br>
The belt consists preferably of a knitted fabric, enabling stretchability in the lengthwise direction of the belt. Thus, the belt is not constrictive. Neither chest breathing nor abdominal breathing of the patient or person being monitored is affected. The belt runs in the garment transversely to the longitudinal axis of the body when, for example, the breathing is being monitored. When two belts are present in the garment, one can monitor both the chest breathing and the abdominal breathing.<br>
A stretchable woven or nonwoven fabric can also be considered as the material for the belt. Stretchable threads can be laid onto, sewn into or embroidered onto the woven or nonwoven.<br>
The belt can also be produced in a single manufacturing step along with the textile (special sewing, knitting or weaving techniques are suitable for this, namely, so-called fully fashioned ones), wherein regions of the textile, the belt regions with adapted stretching qualities, can be formed. The stretching in the back can be less than the stretching in the chest and abdominal area.<br>
The flat knitting technique or also the heald shaft and Jacquard weaving techniques in particular make it possible to incorporate functions like changing stiffness and locally varying inserts of different materials into the surface. In the case of knitting, float stitches with top or bottom pads are possible. In the case of weaving, this is made possible by weaves such as linen, twill, or open. "Fully fashioned" means a flat knitting technology allowing one to make a garment in a single work step, without later sewing steps. Thanks to rehanging of stitches and<br><br>
5<br>
other techniques, in the "fully fashioned" technology one can also achieve other configuration possibilities beyond weaving and figuring, in addition to the overall layout. Thus, the belt can be integrated directly when making the garment, without additional cutting and sewing work. By selecting the stitch formation, the stitch width and the yarn, properties varying in wide ranges can be created.<br>
To prevent the belt from shifting in the garment, the belt is at least partly sewn to the garment. Other portions can be left free, so that the belt can be pulled tight regardless of the fit of the garment.<br>
To close the belt, a snap button or a Velcro strip is provided on it.<br>
The protection of the connection lines is improved if the belt emerges into a tubelike region of the garment, through which the connection cable is led.<br>
Single conductors can be used for the electrical connection of the sensors to the evaluating electronics, each of these being insulated separately. These single conductors can be incorporated into a woven fabric, namely, as the warp threads. In this way, one achieves a robust fiat ribbon cable, which is very flexible, and which can hardly twist because of the corresponding width. At the same time, the essentially nonstretchable, nonconducting warp threads protect the sensitive wires against overstretching, tearing or breaking on account of too sharp a bending radius. The insulated single conductors can also be incorporated in the knitted fabric as stationary threads.<br>
The contacting with the sensors integrated into the textile or placed on the textile can be done by garment industry methods. For this, conductor tubes for stress relief, zig zag tubes to increase the stretching capacity, and ends with the insulation stripped off can be sewn, embroidered, glued, or welded onto the textile by known techniques. At the stripped and conductive ends of the cable, the sensors can be glued, soldered, knitted, sewn, welded or applied by coating. Some of these work steps can also be performed together, so as to carry out the conductive contacting and any necessary insulation in a single work step.<br>

Figure 1 shows a body suit 1 for infants and small children. The body suit 1 is shown in the unfolded condition, looking at the inside. On the body suit, one recognizes a back piece 2, which passes as a single piece into a right front piece 3 and a left front piece 4. The two front pieces 3 and 4 are separated from the back piece 2 by imaginary broken lines 5. In the practical embodiment, the two front pieces 3 and 4 are tailored with no lateral seam. The terms "front piece" and "back piece" are used here in ihe traditional parlance of the garment industry.<br>
At the lower end of the back piece 2, a flap or crotch piece 6 is tailored, passing through the crotch when wearing the garment.<br>
At the upper end of the two front pieces 3 and 4 are arm cutouts 7 and 8, in which sleeves 9 and 10 emerging from the arm cutouts 7 and 8 are sewn on.<br>
An upper edge 11 forms a neck cutout in the wearing condition.<br>
The right front piece 5 is bounded at the side by a straight edge 12, which starts at the edge 11 for the neck cutout and passes into the crotch piece 6 at approximately 13, i.e., at a height characterizing the transition between the back piece 2 and the crotch piece 6, with a curved tailored edge 14. The left front piece 4 passes with a rounded edge 16 into a straight, downward running edge 17, which in turn passes at the height of the comer 13 in a rounded segment 18 into the curved edge 19, which at the same time also represents the side boundary of the crotch piece 6.<br>
The transverse dimension of the front piece 4 is larger than that of the front piece 3, so that when worn the front piece 4 can fold across the side of the front piece 3 away from the body.<br>
To secure the body suit 1 in the closed condition, snap button top halves 21 are present along the edge 17 and 18. The snap button top halves 21 correspond to snap button bottom halves arranged along the tailored edge 12. Of these snap button bottom halves, one recognizes their rivet rings 22, which are used to rivet them to the body suit 1.<br>
Additional snap button top halves 21 are present on the lower free end of the crotch piece 6. These correspond to snap button top halves that are sewn onto the outside of the two front pieces 3 and 4 and therefore they are not shown in the figure.<br>
Instead of the'snap buttons shown, buttons, hooks or tentacle closures can also be provided to close the textile, instead of the snap buttons shown.<br>
The body suit 1 described thus far serves as a support for sensors in order to monitor vital functions of the wearer. The sensors include a temperature sensor 24, a total of 3 electrodes 25, 26 and 27, in order to tap the action currents of the heart in two channels, and two strain gage<br><br>
7<br>
measuring strips 28 and 29, indicated by broken lines, to detect the chest breathing and abdominal breathing. Additional sensors in the form of electrodes can be present to measure the skin resistance or the transpiration.<br>
The base material for the body suit 1, including the arms 9 and 10, consists of a knitted fabric, as is suggested by 23. The knitted fabric can be a tricot, a hosiery knit, or a knit fabric. The advantage of the knitted fabric is that the textile fabric can stretch in both axial directions and has a certain recoil ability. Thanks to this property, a tighter fit is assured, and with no tendency to form folds during movement.<br>
The fit to the body can be further improved by knitting in yet another elastomeric thread, for example spandex, to a slight extent.<br>
The way to knit in spandex threads is familiar from the prior art and thus does not need to be further discussed here.<br>
The elongation measuring strip 29 is located in a belt 31, which is designed as a knitted tube. The stitch wales lie in the lengthwise direction of the belt 31. The belt 31 is sewn to the body suit 1 at approximately one site 32, indicated by a broken line. The belt 31 starts in the vicinity of the edge of cut 12 and reaches, as shown, across the edge of cut 17. It lies perpendicular to the lengthwise axis of the human body when the body suit 1 is being worn. Furthermore, it is dimensioned such that when the body suit is worn it is led out from between the two front pieces 3 and 4. To fasten the free end of the belt 31, another snap button 33 is provided, corresponding to snap button sockets located on the outside of the front piece 3 or the back piece 2. For drawing reasons, these are not recognizable in Figure 1. Basically, they are concealed by the belt 31.<br>
Since the belt 31, as mentioned, is designed as a tube, the elongation measuring strip 29 can be located protected on the inside. Mechanical damage is for the most part precluded. Moreover, skin irritation which might be caused by the elongation measuring strip and its edges is likewise avoided, since there is a layer of fabric between the skin of the wearer and the elongation measuring strip 29. The material for this fabric can be the same material as used for the main part of the body suit 1, namely, essentially cotton or any skin-tolerated fabric based on synthetic fiber that ensures good wearing comfort, since in particular it should also be good at taking up moisture.<br>
In the vicinity of the arm cutout 7, the electrode 26 is located on the belt 31, as shown. It is placed such that, when the body suit 1 is worn, the electrode lies against the body at the location which is familiar to the discipline of electrocardiography. The second electrode 28 is likewise located in a prolongation of the belt 31 at the same body height.<br>
Another belt 34 runs transversely to the back piece 2 at a height corresponding to just above the belly button in the worn condition. Belt 36 [sic] is constructed the same as the belt 31<br><br>
8<br>
and it is also secured in similar fashion. The tubelike belt 34 is sewn firmly to the right front piece 3, the back piece 2 and the left front piece 4 up to a point 35. The adjoining segment forms a free lap piece, containing the elongation measuring strip 30. The free end of the belt 34 is provided with a snap button 36, so as to keep the belt under tension against the body of the wearer.<br>
The belt 34 as well has an electrode for tapping the action currents of the heart, in the form of the electrode 27. Its position corresponds to the position required for the two-channel tapping of the heart currents.<br>
Extremely fine, insulated wires, as shown by broken lines at 37, are used for tapping the electrical signals from the electrodes 26, 27, 28, the thermistor in the form of an NTC resistor 24, and the two elongation measuring strips 29, 30. These wires, because of their fineness, are extremely fragile. In order to protect them mechanically, they are part of a fabric strip 38. The fabric strip 38 is woven as a strip with closed edges, which cannot become frayed. In this strip, the insulated wires 37 form parallel warp threads alongside each other. To the right and left of these centrally located electrical wires there are woven in warp threads 39 consisting of cotton or synthetic fiber and for the most part not stretchable.<br>
The weft threads 40 of the strip 38 also consist of unstretchable cotton, synthetic or mixed fibers.<br>
The ribbon cable obtained in this way runs next to the edge of cut 12, being covered by a sewn-on flap 41. At the height of the belt 34, a first segment branches off at right angles, runs into the belt 34, and makes appropriate contact there. Another part of the ribbon cable 38 bends over, roughly underneath the electrode 28, in order to make contact with the sensors contained in the belt 31, including the electrode 28.<br>
The lower free end of the striplike cable is provided with a plug 42, in order to connect the sensors electrically to an evaluating electronic system.<br>
Due to the special arrangement of the striplike cable 38, it runs when worn through the center of the body in the direction of the legs, thereby producing the least possible hindrance, and also minimizing the risk of the cable getting torn by the movements of the wearer, especially an infant. It can be led out in the leg cutout and does not hinder the infant in its natural movement, even if the child is rather big and is turning in bed. There is no risk of strangulation.<br>
At the same time, the body suit 1 completely enveloping the thorax and abdomen ensures that the various sensors remain placed at the proper location on the body. They cannot shift in either the circumferential direction or the longitudinal direction. The pretensioning also ensures the necessary contact pressure so that the electrical connection between the electrodes 26, 27, 28 and the skin surface remains in place. The tight fit of the belts 31 and 34 means that the<br><br>
9<br>
elongation measuring strips 29 and 30 will also transmit the expansion resulting from chest and abdominal breathing. This ensures a monitoring of the wearer's breathing.<br>
The elongation measuring strip 29, 30 is shown in detail in Figure 2. Figure 2 reveals the cut-open tubelike belt 31, with a U-shaped strip 43 being arranged on the side of the flat-lying tube facing the wearer or the body. The web extends with a first leg 44 parallel to the lengthwise dimension of the belt 31. At the end corresponding to the free end of the belt 31, it passes into a back segment 45, which finally emerges into a leg 46 that goes parallel to the leg 44. At the free ends of the two legs, the corresponding electrical lines 37 are hooked up.<br>
The construction of the elongation measuring strip 29 and 30 is shown in the cross section drawing of Figure 3. Here, one notices that an insulating layer 47 is first arranged on the inside of the belt 31. The insulating layer 47 follows the trend of the strips 44, 45, 46. The insulating layer 47 is insulating in the electrical sense, i.e., it is extremely high-resistive.<br>
In the middle, an electrically conductive layer 48 is arranged on the insulating layer 47. The electrically conductive layer 48 is narrower than the insulating layer 47. It continues uninterrupted for the entire length of the snips 44, 45, 46.<br>
The internal construction is shown enlarged at 49.<br>
The electrically conducting layer 48 is finally covered by another insulating layer 51, as can be seen from the cross sectional drawing. In this way, the electrically conductive layer 48 is enveloped on all sides and makes electrical contact only at the ends of the strips 44 and 46 via the conductor 37.<br>
The material for the layers 47, 48, 51 is an elastomer, which is skin-tolerable and also preferably nonallergenic. Suitable materials ate polyurethane, silicone and fluoro-elastomers. Moreover, these elastomers have the property of being very stretchable and not hindering the stretching ability of the belt 31, which serves as a substrate for the elongation measuring strips 29, 30.<br>
The elastomers used have a greater stretching ability than the textile substrate on which they are fastened. The textile substrate protects the elastic structure against overstrain. The elastomers, for example in the case of silicone, are distinguished by very slight rigidity and a low Shore A-hardness of less than 20. If the layer has a slight thickness of less than 1 mm, the stretching of the textile substrate will be insignificantly hindered by the elastomer.<br>
Furthermore, this elastomer depending on the applications should be at least warm water resistant, so that the body suit can be washed, hi the case of higher requirements for sterility, hot water resistance may also be required, in order to disinfect the body suit 1. If necessary, a sterilization in the autoclave might even be desired, which further increases the demands on the temperature and steam resistance of the elastomers. The same holds, of course, for the insulation of the connection wires 37.<br><br>
10<br>
Since the above-mentioned elastomers are essentially electrical nonconductors, the conductivity of the central conductive layer can only be maintained by embedding conductive particles, such as carbon particles 52, in an appropriate amount. The carbon particles are embedded in a proportion such that a specific resistance of around 25 ohm cm is created. Preferably, the specific resistance varies in a range between 2 ohm cm and 1 kohm cm.<br>
Thanks to the electrically conductive particles embedded in the elastomer, the specific resistance of the electrically conductive resistance layer 48 varies as a function of the stretching. Since the elongation measuring strip 29 and 30 has a U-shaped trend, a higher useful signal will be generated, because two strips lying parallel to each other in the lengthwise direction will be stretched at the same time. The useful signal is larger than if only one strip is used. An even greater sensitivity is achieved by having more than two strips in parallel with each other, so long as space conditions permit. The contacting preferably occurs'by embedding the ends of the connection wires 37 with the insulation peeled off in the not yet hardened elastomer of the resistance layer 48. Then the insulating elastomer layer 51 is placed on this.<br>
In place of carbon particles, appropriate metal particles can also be used. One should make sure that the metal particles remain electrically conductive inside the elastomer, even at the surface, and are not oxidized into a nonconductive layer at the surface.<br>
The electrodes 26, 27, 28 are placed on the inner top side of the body suit as a conductive layer and have the shape of a circular disk with a diameter of around 1.5 cm. They are constructed in similar manner to the resistance layer 48. They consist of an elastomer 53, in which once again electrically conductive particles 52 are embedded. The connection wire 37 is embedded at one stripped end 54 in the not yet hardened elastomer mass and is thereby both electrically contacted and mechanically secured, as is also the case with the elongation measuring strips 29, 30.<br>
The surface can be smooth or structured. In the case of a structuring, the surface consists of an arrangement of tetrahedra or pyramids or an imitation textile surface, which improves the transport of sweat, the wearing comfort, and the draping quality, as well as the contact resistance. The electrode can also be made entirely of textile, by working electrically conductive yarn or threads into a textile surface. This surface; can either be sewn on in the specified shape and size or be worked in as a tarsia when knitting the belt.<br>
Since what is important for the electrode is not a change in resistance, but a lowest possible resistance, the proportion of electrically conductive particles 52 may be rather high (&gt;50% by volume).<br>
Instead of the mentioned carbon panicles, metal particles can also be used, hi selecting the suitable material, however, one should make sure that the metal particles do not have any<br><br>
11<br>
electrically insulating oxide layer, even after the hardening of the polymer. Otherwise, they would merely serve as a nonconducting filler, which would defeat the purpose of this measure.<br>
In the sample embodiment of Figure 1, the body suit I was produced, for example, by circular knitting, followed by cutting out and hemming of the edges. The connection cables are produced as separate strips and then sewn on.<br>
Figure 6 shows one embodiment produced by the so-called "fully fashioned" method. This is a special flatbed knitting technique, in which the desired structure (except for the sleeves 9 and 10) is produced in the particular desired form in a single work step.<br>
One achieves a different stretching ability in the back region 2 because, as is shown, individual threads 60 lie there as a float in the knitted fabric 23, i.e., they are not knitted off. Float means in the garment industry that the threads lie in the direction of the stitch row, without forming stitches. This reduces the stretching ability on account of the lack of a stitch structure.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible, as shown at 61, to knit conductive threads in directly so as to achieve the contacting of the sensor 26. The knitted-in threads at first run in the direction of the stitch row, i.e., they form stitch rows, or they are stitched together with the base material as plaiting threads. In the vicinity of the side edge 12, these conductive threads that form the connection wires are then incorporated in the direction of the stitch wale, and emerge as free ends at a stitched-on bracket 62, so that they can make contact there at a plug, corresponding to the plug 42.<br>
Elongation sensor 30 is connected in a similar manner, in that several wires are knitted in at a distance from each other and thus electrically insulated from each other, in order to accomplish the electrical contacting.<br>
Preferably several conductors are knitted in for each electrical line, in order to achieve a certain redundancy, so that the electrical contact is not lost if one of the conductors gets broken.<br>
So that body sweat absorbed by the textile base material does not produce any unwanted short circuiting between the conductors, wires each insulated by themselves are preferably stitched in.<br>
Finally, special pattern techniques, as are familiar from the Jacquard process, can be used to knit in structures, as indicated at 62, in order to achieve a shiny metal contact surface, for example.<br>
The advantage of the technique for making the body suit as in Figure 1 lies in the lower requirements on the complexity of the knitting and weaving machines used. On the other hand, a number of cutting and sewing steps are necessary. The cutting and sewing work is significantly reduced in the embodiment as in Figure 6. On the other hand, more complicated textile machines are required.<br><br>

The fundamental principle of the invention has been explained above by means of a body suit. This body suit can very well be used for infants, small children, or even adults. The essential benefit is that it can be used both for bedridden patients/persons, or also worn during normal activity or sports.<br>
Another possibility for implementing the invention is shown in Figures 7 and 8. The type of garment by means, of which the monitoring is carried out is not confined to body suits. Instead, pants 63 can also be used as in Figure 7 and 8. In Figure 7, the pants are supported by means of suspenders 64, which are joined to each other by belts 65. The belts 65 carry sensors 30, shown by broken line, on the side facing the body. The belts, in turn, run in the direction transverse to the lengthwise axis of the body and lie against the body thanks to their natural elasticity. Additional sensors can easily be placed on the side of the suspenders 64 facing the body. Thanks to the pretensioning of the belt 65 running in the chest region, the suspenders are likewise held closely fitting against the surface of the body, in order to take measurements, as has been explained in connection with Figure 1.<br>
The sample embodiment of Figure 8 involves overalls with a bib 66, on whose side facing the body the sensors 30 are placed. The belts 65 emerge sideways from the bib 66 and surround the body of the wearer. They elastically press the bib 66 with the sensors 30 located on its inner side against the skin surface, as explained. Furthermore, suspenders 64 emerge from the top edge of the bib 66 and lead to the waistband of the pants 63.<br>
The natural weight of the lower part of the pants 64 prevents the sensors arranged on the suspenders 64 of belts 65 from shifting upward in undesirable manner while being worn and leaving their prescribed measurement location on the body.<br>
The garment shown in Figures 7 and 8 is also especially suitable for monitoring the bodily functions of people carrying out their normal activity and requiring full mobility.<br>
As per Figure 1, the ribbon cable 38 is used for connecting the sensors 29, 30. This is woven as a flat ribbon with closed edges. At roughly the height of the branch 34, the ribbon cable is incised lengthwise, in order to produce the F-shape by folding over.<br>
When very many sensors or electrodes need to be connected, it might be difficult to accommodate the many wires as warp threads in one plane, such as occurs in a simple flat strip. For a very large number of connection lines or wires, the structure as in Figure 9 is especially suitable. Here, the connection cable 38 consists of a woven tube. Such a woven tube is endless in the circumferential direction and forms two imaginary strips 67 and 68, which are joined together as a single piece along their two margins by the spirally running weft threads, hi this way, a two-ply formation is created, and connection wires 37 can be accommodated in each layer. The connection wires, in turn, run in the warp direction.<br><br>
13<br>
At the desired height 69, the two layers 67 and 68 are separated from each other and folded over, as shown, to produce the desired F-shaped structure.<br>
Figure 10 reveals how not just two outlets 31 and 34, but more outlets, such as three outlets 31, 34, 71, are possible by means of the striplike cable 38. For this, the strip after being woven is separated in the lengthwise direction in the desired manner, parallel to the warp threads, and folded over.<br>
According to Figure 11, the relatively broad strip 10, whose overall width when lying flat is as wide as the sum of the widths of the individual branch lines 31, 34, 71, is folded in accordion fashion. This reduces the width of the striplike cable 38 to the width of the broadest branch, for example, branch 31. Furthermore, a "wiring harness" can be created, in which the individual branch lines 31, 34, 71 lead off from different sides. A leading off from the same side, i.e., an F with three arms, can also be easily achieved.<br>
Figures 12-17 illustrate a number of methods for combining the conductor of an insulated wire with a textile backing 73. An insulated conductor 74 is stripped of its insulation for a distance, so that the wire 75 contained inside the conductor 74 is exposed. Using sewing thread 76, the bare piece of wire is sewn onto the electrically nonconductive textile substrate 73.<br>
According to Figure 13, the stripped wire 75 is stitched firmly to the backing by means of a thread 76.<br>
In the sample embodiment of Figure 14, the bare wire 75 is secured by means of glue spots 77. Instead of separate glue spots 77, if the textile substrate contains threads susceptible of hot melt gluing, the stripped wire 75 can also be secured to the substrate by melting these threads to the glue state. The melting can be achieved by heat or by ultrasound.<br>
Figures 15 and 16 illustrate how the stripped wire 75 is sewn as a thread into the substrate 73. As Figure 16 reveals, the wire 75 appeal's alternate on either side of the textile substrate. The textile substrate can be woven, knitted, or nonwoven.<br>
The above-mentioned sensors made from elastomer lie flat against the skin and largely seal off this portion of the skin. Skin transpiration can only emerge underneath the sensor with difficulty. To improve the aeration and the draining off of sweat, the sensor surface can be structured as shown in Figure 17. It consists, for example, of a plurality of small pyramids 78, whose tips are directed at the skin. Under moderate pressure, channels are formed between the tips, through which sweat can drain off.<br>
Beneath the surface shown, the wire 75 used for the contacting can be arranged as in Figure 12-16, or by using a Jacquard technique, as explained by means of Figure 6.<br>
The elongation sensor per Figure 2 consists of an elastomer, which is filled with electrically conductive particles. However, hydrogels can also be used as an elongation-dependent sensor. Such a sensor contains a hydrogel, which is filled with an electrolyte solution.<br><br>
14<br>
Water is stored in a three-dimensional cross-linked matrix of hydrophilic water-insoluble polymers and is virtually immobilized in this way. Suitable hydrogels are polymethacrylates, polyphenylpyrrolidones, or polyphenylalcohol. A water-soluble salt is added to the water stored in the hydrogel layer, in order to achieve an ionic conductivity for the water. Suitable as the salt is AgCI, as well as any other physiologically safe metal salt, for example, table salt. A change in cross section caused by a change in length due to stretching or pressure influences the conductivity. The resistance measured is an indication of the strain to which the sensor outfitted with a hydrogel is subjected.<br>
The hydrogel is located as a kind of filler between two water-tight and ion-tight, highly elastic layers, similar to that shown for the conductive layer 48 in Figure 3. Thus, the construction of a sensor based on a hydrogel corresponds to the construction shown in Figure 3, using the hydrogel in place of the conductive elastomer 48. Silicone can be used as the elastomer.<br>
The benefit of hydrogels is that, depending on the degree of cross linking, one can achieve a very soft texture, conveniently worn on the body.<br>
The garment according to the invention has been explained in detail in connection with a body suit. The body suit represents the preferred embodiment. However, it is also possible to fasten the indicated sensors on vests or undershirts, as long as these garments are worn closely against the body.<br>
In a body suit, one or two belts which can stretch in the lengthwise direction run transversely to the longitudinal axis of the wearer. Elongation measuring strips are arranged in these belts. Electrodes for tapping the action currents of the heart or for measuring the skin resistance are located on the outer side of the belts, making contact with the body.<br><br>
