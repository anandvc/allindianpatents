				<td>Technology field<br>
The present invention relates to dehulling machinery for agricultural products, more particularly to a centrifugal dehuller having distributed choke-relief cluster for dehulling sunflower seeds<br>
Background technology<br>
Under the current technique, there are diverse dehulling equipments for agricultural products already, among which the centrifugal impact dehulling device for sunflower seeds is most popular dehuller to be widely used nowadays. This dehulling device mainly consists of headspindle, impeller, electric motor and cylinder for impact. The internal structure is like this: the electric motor is coupled with the headspindle, with the impeller installed on the headspindle, and the electric motor and impeller are fixed inside the impact cylinder. The working principle is that the agricultural products will be fed into the center of impact cylinder directly and then threw into the impact cylinder after accelerated by the rotary impeller, it is the impaction which dehulls the agricultural products. The main problem associated with this type of dehuller is the low first round hulling rate, which is only about 30%. Therefore, the repeated sieve separation and other process for the kernels after hulling, which not only increase the subsequent treatment workload but also the broken rate of agricultural will be increased as well. The main reason that results in the low first round hulling rate is the feed-in inlet of the impeller is too large, input volume is higher, but the impact ratio between the agricultural products and the impacting cylinder has been lowered, thereby result in disorder impact and unreasonable impact point, so that most of agricultural products have no opportunity to be impacted with the impacting cylinder but impacted with other agricultural products themselves and dropped with the disturbance of other agricultural products when they are threw into the cylinder. Thereby, as a result, the first round hulling rate is low. In addition, there're always foreign matters like some plant stalks containing in the agricultural products, the existence of these foreign matters will definitely lower the impact ratio between agricultural products and impacting cylinder and then resulting in the low hulling rate at the first round.<br>
The technical difficulty needs to be solved by this practical and new-model dehuller is to overcome the problem of low hulling rate at the first round of hulling for the current centrifugal dehulling device, and the distributed choke-relief cluster and centrifugal dehuller is a kind of dehuller with high output and high rate of both on first round of hulling and whole kernels.<br>
There is housing for this new dehuller, the special structural point is that there are several centrifugal dehullers installed inside the housing, and distribution storage on the top of the housing, inside the distribution storage, there is a rotary materials-scatter driven by a power unit, which can allocate materials into each individual centrifugal dehuller evenly.<br>
There are some choke-relief tooth-rods which is used to prevent materials from pile-up or blockage of materials discharge outlets.<br>
On the bedplate of the distribution storage, there're stoppers (piece of rod), which is corresponding to the tooth-rod on the materials-scatter. The function is to stop the foreign matters like stalks from entering the dehuller or break them into pieces.<br>
The advantages of this new model dehuller is that it applies distribution storage and materials-scatter to allocate the materials for each dehuller individually, thus the input materials for each dehuller has been decreased, thereby the order impact between materials and impact cylinder has been well guaranteed. Let the several centrifugal dehullers operate simultaneously, which not only keep the dehuller's output on the same level, but also obtain an increase in the first round hulling rate of the materials, up to 70%. Meanwhile obtain an increase in the whole kernels rate of the agricultural products. In addition, the materials-scatter with tooth-rod designed inside the distribution storage, and the corresponding stoppers (piece of rod) to the block-proof tooth-rod, the materials-scatter allows for the materials being allocated for each centrifugal dehuller individually, so that the input materials for each dehuller can be allocated evenly, and meanwhile the foreign matters like stalks from entering the<br>
dehuller or break them into pieces, thus not only prevent the materials discharge outlets from blocking but also obtain an increase in first round hulling rate.<br>
Attached drawing No.l is Structure Diagrammatic Sketch<br>
Attached drawing No.2 is Vertical View<br>
Attached drawing No.3 is Sectional View (A-A) of Attached drawing No.l.<br>
Mode of operation<br>
As the attached drawing shows: there is one housing 1 for the dehuller, which is made of cylinder and top and bottom flanges, and with four centrifugal dehullers 7 inside. The number of dehullers can be increased or decreased according to the actually requirement, which is not limited to four only. The structure of the current centrifugal dehuller 7 is as follows: there is a distribution storage 2 on the top of the housing, which is composed of bedplate, cylinder, conical plate and flange. On the top of distribution storage 2, there is a feed-in hopper, through which materials enter into distribution storage 2, bolts are used to connect the distribution storage 2 and housing 1 and with the centrifugal dehullers 7 installed on the bedplate. There are discharge outlets 8 on the bedplate corresponding to each of centrifugal dehullers, through which materials enter into each of centrifugal dehullers 7. There is a power unit installed in the distribution storage 2 to drive the rotary materials-scatter 5, the above-mentioned power unit 6 is a deceleration electric motor. It is installed on the bedplate of the distribution storage 2 inside the housing 1. The above-mentioned materials-scatter 5 is flat shape, which can also be cross or star shape in the practical use. The materials-scatter 5, connected together with the power unit 6 by its central fixed mount, driven by the power unit 6 to rotate and allocate materials evenly to each of discharge outlets 8 and then enter into each of the centrifugal dehullers 7. On the outskirt at the bottom of the materials-scatter, some choke-relief tooth-rods 4 are used to prevent materials from pile-up or blockage of discharge outlets 8, the number of the tooth-rods is non-limited. The function of it is to put materials in order and sort out foreign matters like stalks in the materials to prevent materials from blockage of discharge outlets 8. On the bedplate of the distribution storage 2, there're stoppers<br>
3(piece of rod), it can be made by some groups. There are four groups with three stopper in each group for this specific dehuller, stoppers 3 are staggered with the tooth-rod 4, which is corresponding to the tooth-rod 4 on the materials-scatter. The function is to stop the foreign matters like stalks from entering the dehuller or break them into pieces. Thus, not only prevent the stalks from entering the centrifugal dehullers, but also prevent the discharge outlets 8 from blocking, meanwhile obtain an increase in first round hulling rate.<br><br><br>
