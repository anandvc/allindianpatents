2.         Technical problem to be resolved by this invention<br>
For many application in membrane technology (reversal osmosis, nanofiltration, micro-and ultrafiltration, electrodialysis, diffusion dialysis, membrane electrolysis, membrane fuel cells), hydrophilised or chemically stable polymers containing ion exchange groups are needed but these however are only commercially available in limited amounts - even today, in some cases vinyl polymers the chemical stability of which is limited are still being employed in the above-mentioned applications. Furthermore, the band width of the properties of these commercial polymers is not very great.<br>
1:        State of the art and its disadvantages<br>
a)        Polymers modified with basic N<br>
There are still relatively few basic N-modified polymers on the marked, the most<br>
important being mentioned below:<br>
â€¢	poly(4-vinyl pyridine), poly-2-vinyl pyridine) and copolymers.<br>
These two polymers are commercially available, also as block copolymers with polystyrene. They are used for example as pre-stages for anion exchange membranes (Reiner, Ledjeff1, Gudernatsch, Krumbholz2) or complexed with Schiffs bases containing cobalt for selective oxygen permeation3. The drawback with this class of polymer is the tertiary C-H-bond in the polymer main chain, which is susceptible to oxidation.<br>
â€¢	polybenzimidazols<br>
Polybenzimidazols are a class of polymers which have considerable chemical and mechanical stability. Many types of polybenzimidazols (fully and partly aromatic) have already been synthesised and examined1. However, only a few types are produced commercially, of which the most important is the polymer FBI (poly[(2,2-m-phenylene)-<br><br>
5,5'-bibenzimidazol) produced by Celanese under the commercial name CELAZOLE. Inter alia, this polymer is used in the form of low-flammability textiles5 for the Fire Brigade. The drawbacks with this polymer are that it is difficult to dissolve in organic solvents and so has poor working properties; furthermore, it is very expensive.<br>
â€¢	polyethylene imine<br>
Polyethylene imine is used in organic chemistry and biochemistry as a precipitating agent for proteins6. The advantage of this polymer is that by virtue of its highly hydrophilic nature (1 N on 2 C), it is water soluble and therefore, in its pure form, there will not form any resistant membranes and furthermore, by virtue of its purely aliphatic structure, it is not very chemically stable.<br>
b)	Anion exchange polymers and membranes<br>
The commercial anion exchange polymers and membranes can be divided into two main categories:<br>
â€¢	anion exchange polymers which are produced by reaction of chlorinated7 or<br>
bromomethylated   polymers with tertiary amines.   The drawback with this<br>
reaction is the cancerogenic nature of the halomethylation reaction and the lack<br>
of chemical stability of the aromatic-CH2-NR3+ grouping.<br>
â€¢	anion exchange polymers produced by the alkylation of tertiary N, for example<br>
of poly(vinyl pyridine)1'2'9 with halogen alkanes1,2. The disadvantage with this<br>
reaction is that only very few commercial polymers with tertiary N are available<br>
(see above) arid thus the band width of the membrane properties to be achieved<br>
is limited.   The drawback with poly(vinyl pyridine)s is the limited chemical<br>
stability (see above).<br>
c)	Cation exchange polymers sulphonated in the lateral group<br>
There are very few commercial polymers and membranes of this type. The most important of both representatives shall be mentioned here:<br>
â€¢	nafion10<br>
This polymer has a perfluoralkyl main chain and a perfluorether lateral chain at the end<br><br>
of which hangs a sulphonic acid group. This polymer is used in all applications which require great chemical membrane stability, for example membrane fuel cells". The<br>
disadvantage with this polymer is its high price ($800 US/sq.m) and the complicated production process10. â€¢    poly-X200012<br>
This polymer consists of a poly(phenylene) main chain and an aryl lateral chain, the precise name is poly(oxy-l,4-phenylene-carbonyl-l,4-phenylene). This polymer is sulphonated12 only at the end of the lateral chain. According to statement12, this polymer in the sulphonated form has good proton conductivity levels even at temperatures in excess of 100Â°C at which the proton conductivity of sulphonated poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) already drops markedly. This property could be brought out by a better association of the sulphonic acid groups in the poly-X 2000, since the sulphonic acid groups are in the lateral chain in the case of the poly-X 2000 - in the sulphonated PEEK, the sulphonic acid groups are in the main chain and consequently, on account of the rigidity of the PEEK main chain, they associate less readily. A drawback with this polymer is its poorer thermal stability compared with sulphonated PEEK12 and the fact that it is not commercially available.<br>
4.        Object of the invention<br>
As a result of this invention, aryl main chain polymers and membranes which are modified with basic nitrogen in the lateral group and which are therefore hydrophilised become accessible which have very good thermal and mechanical stability. Furthermore, this invention opens a way to chemically stable cation and anion exchange membranes which additionally, by reason of the presence of the ion exchange groups in the lateral chain, display a greater degree of freedom for forming ion exchange group associates than if the ion exchange groups were present in the polymer main chain.<br><br>

main chain polymer comprising aryl-containing basic N-groups of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

wherein R3 is hydrogen, alkyl or aryl, and<br>
the units R1 and/or R2 are linked by at least one group selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>

R7 is an aromatic group containing tertiary basic N,<br>
R8  is hydrogen, alkyl or aryl, which optionally contains tertiary basic N,<br>
X is hydrogen or an alkyl group, comprising<br>

aromatic ketones or aldehydes containing tertiary basic N-groups having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
to give an intermediate product having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and protonating or etherifying the intermediate with water or an alkyl halide, to give the aryl main chain polymer having aryl-containing basic N-groups.<br>
5.        Problem resolved by the invention (description of the invention)<br>
The description of the invention is sub-divided into five parts for reason of clarity:<br>
a.	basic N-modified polymers by an addition reaction to lithiated polymers<br>
b.	basic N-modified polymers by substitution reaction with lithiated polymers<br><br>
c	anion exchange polymers and membranes<br>
d         cation exchange polymers sulphonated in the lateral group<br>
i<br>
e	acid-based blends and acid-based blend membranes from polymers a or b with<br>
any desired sulphonated polymers or with the cation exchange polymers d.<br>
a)         Basic N-modifiedpolymers by addition reaction to lithiated polymers Guiver tells of PSU hydrophilically modified in the lateral chain via a metallising reaction and subsequent addition of selected aldehydes or ketones, forming PSU13 modified with OH groups in the lateral chain (Fig. 1).   The following degrees of substitution were achieved: benzaldehyde 1.9, benzophenone 1.0, acetone 0.5. Surprisingly, now, it has been found that according to the reaction in Fig. 1, aromatic ketones and aldehydes which contain tertiary N can be added to lithiated PSU. Examples of such basic aromatic ketones which can be added are (Fig. 2):<br>
â€¢	2,2'bipyridyl ketone<br>
â€¢	4,4'-bis(dimethyl amino)-benzophenone (Michler's ketone)<br>
â€¢	4,4'-bis(diethyl amino)-benzophenone.<br>
Examples of addable basic aromatic aldehydes are (Fig. 2):<br>
â€¢	4-dimethyl amino benzaldehyde<br>
â€¢	4-diethyl amino benzaldehyde<br>
â€¢	pyridine-2-aldehyde, pyridine-3-aldehyde, pyridine-4-aldehyde.<br>
Where this reaction is concerned, the degrees of substitution are dependent upon the size of the basic aromatic compound. Thus, with the sterically hindered ketons 2,2-bipyridyl ketone, 4,4'-bis(dimethyl amino)-benzophenone (Michler's ketone) and 4,4'-bis(diethyl amino)-benzophenone, degrees of substitution of about 1 are reached while degrees of substitution of up to 2 can be achieved with the above-mentioned less sterically hindered aldehydes.<br>
Upon synthesis of the product of addition of 4,4'-bis(diethyl amino)-benzophenone to lithiated PSU, it was surprisingly found that the substituted polymer was coloured, the colour deepening from pale green to very dark green in time, by exposure to the air. This<br><br>
is probably attributable to oxidation of the PSU addition product by atmospheric oxygen according to the reaction shown in Fig. 3. Presumably, a triphenyl methane dye14 is produced. This reaction points away to chromophoric groups which can be bonded on lithiable polymers. These chromophoric groups are positively charged which means they constitute anion exchanger groupings since the compensating ions, e.g. Cl", are interÂ¬changeable. Since the compensating ions are interchangeable, the oxidised basic polymer displays ion conductivity which it was possible to prove experimentally. Since the positive charge is distributed mesomerically over the system: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
these anion exchange groups are very stable in comparison with normal anion exchange groups.<br>
If it is intended to prevent oxidation of the PSU addition product, the Li-alcoholate intermediate compound which forms during the addition reaction can be captured with alkyl halides Alk-Hal, forming the ether PSU-C(C1R2)-OAlk. Thus, the addition compound becomes more oxidation stable than the addition compound with the free OH-group.<br>
b)        Polymers modified by basicN by substitution reaction with lithiated polymers If low molecular aromatic carboxylic acid esters are caused to react with Li-organic compounds, then in most cases the lithium salts of tertiary alcohols are obtained (Fig. 4)16.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the reaction of basic compounds such as for example isonicotinic acid ethyl ester and N, N-dimethyl amino benzole acid ethyl ester with lithiated PSU can, under the selected conditions (low temperature, low polymer concentration in the solution of the lithiated PSU, excess of a basic compound) can be arrested at the ketone stage (Fig. 5).<br>
In this way, it is possible from lithiated polymers to produce such polymers as are modified with basic N-groups (tertiary N such as pyridile or dialkyl amino group) in the aromatic lateral chain. By virtue of its aromatic nature and by reason of the bonding on<br><br>
the polymer main chain via a carbonyl function, the lateral chain becomes very oxidation stable. The synthesised polymers which contain tertiary N can. in a further step, be converted by N-quaternisation into oxidation stable anion exchange polymers (see c)).<br>
c)	Anion exchange polymers and membranes<br>
The above-mentioned polymers which are modified with basic tertian N" in the aromatic lateral chain can, now, be reacted by means of conventional processes15 to produce anion exchange polymers and membranes, whereby even anion exchange membranes are accessible by the following method: a solution of the lithiable polymer modified with tertiary-N in the lateral group is produced in a dipolar-aprotic solvent (NMP, DMAc, DMF, DMSO, sulpholane, etc.), halogen alkanes and halogen dialkanes in the desired molar ratio are added to the solution in order to generate the desired density of cross-linking and the solvent is evaporated off at elevated temperature. During membrane formation, the tertiary-N are quaternised to anion exchange groups, the dihalogen alkanes at the same time forming a covalent network in the membrane.<br>
d)	Cation exchange polymers which are sulphonated in the lateral group<br>
On a basis of the reaction presented in b) (reaction of an aromatic carboxylic acid ester with lithiated aryl polymer with the bonding of an aromatic lateral group to the aryl main chain polymer via a carbonyl group), aryl main chain polymers which are sulphonated in the lateral group become accessible, subject to the aromatic lateral group being more easily electrophilically sulphonatable than the polymer main chain. In order to achieve this, the aromatic hydrocarbon present in the lateral group must have the greatest electron density of all the aromatic rings of the polymer. A reaction to obtain an aryl main chain polymer sulphonated in the aromatic lateral chain is shown in Fig. 6. In the case of the PSU Udel7 sulphonated in the aromatic lateral chain, the aromatic hydrocarbon at the end of the aromatic lateral chain has the greatest electron density of the entire molecule. For this reason, this aromatic hydrocarbon is sulphonated and in fact in the p-position in relation to the ether bridge since the electronically also possible o-position is sterically hindered in relation to the ether bridge.<br><br>
e)        Acid-based blends and acid-based blend membranes from the polymers a or b polymers sulphonated as desired or with the cation exchange polymers d<br>
The newly obtained polymers listed in sub-paragraphs a, b and d as well as any sulphonated polymers can be combined to produce new acid-based blends and acid-based blend membranes. The location of the acid and basic groups at the end of the aromatic lateral chain opens a way to better association of the ion exchange groups in the blends since the position of the acid and basic groups at the end of the lateral group is less sterically impeded than if these groups were in the polymer main chain. A better possibility of association of acid and basic groups can result in an increase in local concentration of ion exchange groups in the polymer matrix and thus to a higher level of proton conductivity even at relatively low concentrations of ion exchange groups than in the case of rigid aryl main chain polymers modified with acid and basic groups in the main chain. The morphology of the perfluorinated ion exchange polymer Nafion in which the sulphonic acid groups are strongly associated (clustered)10 on account of the extremely hydrophobic perfluorinated backbone, can consequently be "copied" with such new acid-based blends. In addition to the ionic cross-linking by the polysalt formation:<br>

in that to the mixture of acid with basic polymers in the solvent, dihalogen alkanes are added which, during membrane formation,<br>

6.         Examples of embodiment<br>
6.1       Reaction of N,N-dimethyl amino benzaldehyde with lithiated PSU<br>
Batch:<br>
11.05 g PSF Udel P 1800 (0.025 mol) dried<br>
500 ml THF anhydrous<br>
5 mln-BuLi ION (0.05 mol)<br>
10 g 4-dimethyl amino benzaldehyde (0.13 mol), dissolved in 20 ml THF<br>
Procedure<br>
Under barrier gas, fill the THF into the reaction vessel. Afterwards, the dried polymer is introduced with argon into the reaction vessel accompanied by stirring and thorough rinsing. Once the polymer has been dissolved, it is cooled to -65Â°C in a strong argon flow. The polymer solution is then titrated with n-BuLi until a slight yellow/orange colouring indicates that the reaction mixture is now anhydrous. Afterwards, the 10N n-BuLi is injected within 10 mins. Stirring follows for 30 mins. Afterwards, the solution of 4-dimethyl amino benzaldehyde in THF is injected. Stir until such time as the reaction mixture has lost its colour. Maximum waiting time at -65Â°C is 1 hour. Afterwards, the acetone cold bath is taken away and replaced by an ice bath. Allow to warm to 0Â°C and stir for 1 hour at 0Â°C. Afterwards, the reaction mixture is precipitated in 2 litres isopropanol. Dry at 50Â°C firstly in a diaphragm pump vacuum then in an oil pump vacuum. Afterwards, the polymer is ground, suspended in 500 ml methanol and dried once again in a vacuum at 50Â°C. The chemical structural formula of the modified PSU formed is shown in Fig. 7.<br>
Elementary analysis and the 1H-NMR spectrum of the polymer reveal a substitution degree of approximately 2 groups per PSU repetition unit.<br><br>
6.2       Reaction of bis(N,N-diethyl amino)benzophenone with lithiated PSU<br>
Batch:<br>
11.05 g PSU Udel P 1800 (0.025 mol), dried<br>
600 ml THF anhydrous<br>
3mln-BuLi ION (0.03 mol)<br>
25 g 4,4'-bis-diethyl amino benzophenone dissolved in 50 ml THF (0.077 mol)<br>
Procedure:<br>
Under barrier gas, fill the THF into the reaction vessel. Afterwards, the dried polymer is introduced with argon into the reaction vessel accompanied by stirring and thorough rinsing. Once the polymer has been dissolved, it is cooled to -30Â°C in a strong argon flow. The polymer solution is then titrated with n-BuLi until a slight yellow/orange colouring indicates that the reaction mixture is now anhydrous. Afterwards, the 10 N n-BuLi is injected within 10 mins. Stirring follows for 50 mins. Afterwards, the solution of 44'-diethyl amino benzophenone is injected. Stir until such time as the reaction mixture has lost its colour, not more than 24 hours. Afterwards, a mixture of 20 ml isopropanol with 2 ml of water is injected into the reaction solution and afterwards warmed to room temperature. The polymer is precipitated in 2 litres of isopropanol, filtered off and washed with isopropanol. Afterwards, the polymer is stirred into 300 ml i-PrOH. Afterwards, it is filtered off again, suspended again in i-PrOH, stirred and filtered off. Afterwards, the polymer is added to 5 litres of water and stirred. After filtration, it is once again added to 5 litres of water and stirred again. Subsequently, a further filtration process follows and then washing to pH7 and afterwards dried at 80Â°C. The chemical structural formula of the modified PSU formed is shown in Fig. 8. Elementary analysis and the 'H-NMR spectrum of the polymer disclose a substitution degree of approximately 1 group per PSU repetition unit. The polymer is coloured green. a situation which can be attributed to partial formation of triphenyl methyl chromophores by oxidation accompanied by cleavage of the OH group (see Fig. 3). If the polymer is allowed to stand at elevated temperature in dilute acid, the colour deepens to a black-green. With 1H- and I3C-NMR, it was possible to show that the reaction of the reaction<br><br>
product 6.2 shown in Fig. 3 actually takes place: the 1H and the 13C signal of the OH proton, of which the position could be identified by H/D exchange as being recumbent with a chemical shift of 5.8 ppm (1'H-NMR) or a chemical shift of 85 ppm (I3C-NMR), had almost completely disappeared after the reaction products 6.2 had been stored in dilute acid at 60Â°C with air having access.<br>
Formation of the chromophoric group can be prevented by etherifying the OH group by a reaction of the PSU-Li-alkoxide with methyl iodide for example (Fig. 9). The oxidised reaction product 6.2 displays ion conductivity which can be attributed to the causes outlined in para. 5 a). To this end, films of the oxidised polymer were assessed by impedance spectroscopy in 0,5 N HCl with and without secondary HCl treatment. Results:<br>

400 ml THF anhydrous<br>
1.7 ml n-BuLi 10 N (0.017 mol)<br>
3.89	g di(2-pyridyl)-ketone (0.021 mol), dissolved in 20 ml THF<br>

Procedure:<br>
Under barrier gas, fill the THF into the reaction vessel. Afterwards, the dried polymer is introduced with argon into the reaction vessel accompanied by stirring and thorough rinsing. Once the polymer has been dissolved, it is cooled to -60Â°C in a strong argon flow. The polymer solution is then titrated with n-BuLi until a slight yellow/orange colouring indicates that the reaction mixture is now anhydrous. Afterwards, the 10 N n-BuLi is injected within 10 mins. Stirring follows for 50 mins. Afterwards, the solution of N.N-dimethyl amino benzoic acid ethyl ester is injected in THF. Stir for 10 mins. Then inject the mixture of 20 ml isopropanol with 2 ml water into the reaction solution and warm up to room temperature. Precipitate the polymer in 2 litres isopropanol. filter off and wash with isopropanol and methanol. The precipitated polymer is filtered off again, dried and stirred in 100 ml MeOH. Afterwards, it is filtered off again, suspended again in MeOH,<br><br>
stirred, filtered off and dried at 80Â°C. The result of elementary analysis shows a substitution degree of 0.75 p-N,N-dimethyl amino phenyl carbonyl groups per PSU<br>
i<br>

7.         Novelty of the invention<br>
The aforementioned novel polymers and membranes and the method of producing them<br>
have not been described hitherto in the literature.<br><br>
8.        Advantages of the invention<br>
The invention covers new polymers and membranes which are chemically stable on<br>
account of the aromatic lateral chain and which can be further modified under control:<br>
â€¢	By quaternising the basic N with alkyl halides, new anion exchange polymers and<br>
membranes can be produced which, by reason of the direct bonding of the basic<br>
N on the aromatic lateral chain become chemically more stable than commercial<br>
anion exchange polymers and membranes.   Due to the possibility of using<br>
dihalogen alkanes, the anion exchange polymer membranes can furthermore be<br>
covalently cross-linked at the same time.<br>
â€¢	The synthesis of polymers with aromatic lateral groups which are sulphonated in<br>
the aromatic lateral group can improve the association of the sulphonic acid<br>
groups in the polymer matrix and thus lead to higher levels of proton conductivity<br>
even at relatively low ion exchange group concentration s.<br>
â€¢	The acid-base blends and acid-base blend membranes according to the invention<br>
may display a better ion exchange group association than acid-base blends and<br>
acid-base blend membranes, in which the acid and basic groups are present in the<br>
polymer main chain, since the lateral groups are more movable than the polymer<br>
main chain. In addition to the ionic cross-linking due to the polysalt formation,<br>
these blends and blend membranes can, by covalent cross-linking, be further<br>
stabilised in terms of swelling and thus mechanical stability.<br>
