[Title of the Invention]<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SUBSTITUTED AMINOQUINAZOLINONE<br>
DERIVATIVE, INTERMEDIATE THEREFOR, AND PEST CONTROL<br>
AGENT	<br>
[Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a substituted aminoquinazolinone<br>
i<br>
derivative useful as a pest control agent.  In addition, the present invention relates to intermediates and salts of the derivative, a pest control agent containing any of them as an active ingredient, and its usage.<br>
[Background Art] [0002]<br>
The substituted aminoquinazolinone derivative described herein is useful as a pest control agent.  As a process for producing this derivative, there is known a process of reducing the nitrogen-carbon double bond of a substituted iminoquinazolinone derivative with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst (see, for example, JP-A-8-325239 and JP-A-2001-342186).<br>
As a general production process in which a hydrazone is converted to a hydrazine by reduction with<br><br>
hydrogen, there are known processes, i.e., a process using a platinum oxide as a catalyst (see, for example, J. Med. Chem., §_,   221 (1963)) and a process using palladium-carbon as a catalyst (see, for example, J. Org. Chem., 2_6, 1854 (1961)).<br>
These prior art references, however, do not disclose an additive for hydrogen reduction which is characteristic of the present invention.<br>
In addition, it is also known that compounds analogous to a substituted iminoquinazolinone derivative formed as an intermediate in the production process of the present invention are useful as pest control agents (see, for example, JP-A-8-325239 and JP-A-2001-342186).<br>
[Disclosure of Invention] [Problem to be solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
For the production of a substituted amino-quinazolinone derivative, the processes disclosed in the above prior art references have been disadvantageous in that since by-products are produced by hydrogenolysis, both the selectivity and yield of the desired compound are insufficient.  Therefore, there has been a desire for a process that solves this problem and permits industrially efficient production of a substituted aminoquinazolinone derivative.<br>
Heretofore known substituted<br><br>
iminoquinazolinone derivatives are not always satisfactory in performance characteristics as pest control agents from the viewpoint of practical dosage, insecticidal spectrum, residual effect and the like. Accordingly, there has been a desire for the development of a more excellent pest control agent. [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0004]<br>
The present inventors earnestly investigated in order to solve the above problem, and consequently found that the addition of a halogen-containing compound or a sulfur-containing compound as an additive in the reduction with hydrogen using a catalyst markedly improves the selectivity and the yield as compared with conventional processes.  Further, they also found that some of intermediates formed in the production of an aminoquinazolinone are novel compounds, have equal or more effect even at a low dosage as compared with heretofore known substituted iminoquinazolinone derivatives, and have an excellent controlling effect on whiteflies, scales and the like, which are injurious to agriculture and horticulture. On the basis of this finding, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

[0017]<br>
Since the reaction is an equimolar reaction, it is sufficient that the iminoquinazolinone derivative of general formula (II-l) and the compound of general<br><br>
formula (III) are used in equimolar amounts, though either of these reactants may be used in excess.  It is preferable to use the compound of general formula (III) in excess.<br>

[0022]<br>
The pest control agent of the present invention has a marked controlling effect on the above-exemplified insect pests, sanitary pests and/or nematodes, which are injurious to paddy field crops, upland crops, fruit trees, vegetables and other crops, flowers and ornament plants, and the like.  Therefore, the desired effect of the pest control agent of the present invention can be exhibited by applying the agent to the nursery facility, paddy field water, stalks and leaves or soil of paddy field, upland field, fruit trees, vegetables, other crops or flowers and ornament plants at a season at which the insect pests, sanitary pests or nematodes are expected to appear, before their appearance or at the time when their appearance is confirmed.  In addition, the application of the pest control agent of the present invention may<br><br>
be the application for which both of "penetration and translocation" are utilized, wherein the present pest control agent is applied to the nursery soil of crops, ornamental plants or the like; the picking-in hole soil at a transplantation; the plant roots; the irrigation water; or the cultural water of a water culture; so that the compound of the present invention may be absorbed from the roots through or not through the soil.<br>
Moreover, in recent years, IPM (integrated pest management) technology using genetically modified products (herbicide-resistant products, pest-resistant products into which an insecticidal protein-generating gene has been incorporated, disease-resistant products into which a gene generating a substance inducing resistance to disease has been incorporated, products with improved taste, products with improved keeping quality, products with improved yield, etc.), insect pheromones (communication-disturbing agents used for Tortricidae or Mamestra, etc.)/ or natural enemy insects, has been developed.  The pest control agent of the present invention can be used in admixture with such a technique, or can be used in systematization therewith. [0023]<br>
The pest control agent of the present invention is generally prepared into suitable formulations according to a conventional manner for<br><br>
preparation of agrochemicals.<br>
