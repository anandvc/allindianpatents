DRIVE FOR A COMBER<br>
The invention relates to a combing machine or comber, with several combing heads, in accordance with the preamble to Patent Claim 1.<br>
In practice, combers are known whereby, for example, eight combing heads operate simultaneously next to one another. The drive for these combing heads is provided by means of a drive with gear unit arranged next to the combing heads, which is connected by means of longitudinal shafts to the individual elements of the combing heads in the manner of a drive. The fibre slivers formed at the individual combing heads are conducted on a conveyor table next to one another to a downstream drafting device, in which they are stretched and then combined to form a common comber sliver. The fibre sliver formed in the drafting device is then deposited in a can by means of a hopper wheel.<br>
An example of such a comber is to be found, for example, from the literature: "Die Kurzstapelspinnerei - Band III: Kammerei, Strecken (Short Staple Spinning -Volume III: Combing, Drafting), Flyer/The Textile Institute - ISBN 3-908.059-01-1". The arrangement of the combing heads and of the lateral drive is to be found on page 22 of this literature in particular. Each combing head exhibits a nipper device, capable of moving backwards and forwards or to and fro, which is also shown and described on page 23. The drive of the nipper device is provided by a nippers shaft, which is connected in a torsionally-resistant manner to a pivot arm, which at its free end is connected in a torsionally-resistant manner to one end of the nipper device. The nippers shaft obtains its drive via a thrust crank drive from a gear system, which is shown in diagrammatic form, for example, on page 24 of the said literature reference.<br>
In order to increase the productivity of the comber, in practice increasingly higher comb nip numbers are demanded. In part, with modern combers more than 400 comb nips are already being carried out per minute. To put this into effect, the attempt has been made in the past, by appropriate design and suitable selection of materials, to reduce the dimensions of the moving part, and in particular the dimension of the nipper device moving<br><br>
to and fro. Due to the to-and-fro oscillation of the nipper device, very substantial oscillations occur, in particular at high comb nips, which on the one hand require a correspondingly stable design of the drive and bearing elements and, on the other, also impose high demands on the frame of the machine as well as on the foundation on which the machine is secured.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of providing suitable measures for reducing the loads of the oscillations induced by the nipper devices oscillating to and fro, and of in part compensating for them respectively.<br>
It is therefore proposed that the drive or drive elements for initiating the to-and-fro movement of the nipper device is designed in such a way that at least one nipper device carries out a temporally-displaced pivot movement in relation to the other nipper devices. As a result, the situation is achieved in which at least the oscillation amplitude of the opposed oscillating nipper device runs opposed to the other oscillation amplitudes of the other nipper devices, so that the oscillations partly compensate for one another.<br>
It is of advantage, in particular in relation to the overall oscillation picture, if the oscillation movements of the nipper devices of adjacent combing heads in each case are temporally displaced in relation to one another. As a result, it is possible for the oscillations to be compensated for in part over the entire combing machine.<br>
It would also be conceivable, as proposed hereinafter, for the oscillation movements of the nipper devices of at least one group of combing heads arranged next to one another to be temporally displaced in relation to the oscillation movements of the other nipper devices. In this situation, for example, two or three or more combing heads located next to each other can form a group. To compensate for the oscillations it is to advantage if the different oscillation movements take place in each case opposed to one another. That is to say, the oscillation movements can take place, for example, offset by 180Â° to one another. It would also be conceivable, however, for the offset of the oscillation movements of adjacent located groups to take place in a correspondingly staggered manner.<br><br>
In order to implement the offsetting of the oscillation movements between the individual combing heads or groups of combing heads in a simple manner, it is proposed that each combing head be provided with its own drive motor for initiating the oscillation movement of each individual nipper device, this drive motor being connected to a central control unit. With a drive device of this type, it is possible for each combing head and its nipper device respectively to be driven individually. Due to actuation via one central control unit, which also receives signals from correspondingly located positioning sensors, the drive of the individual combing heads can be matched precisely to one another. Inasmuch as combing heads located next to one another are gathered together in groups, it is possible for their nipper devices, of which the pivot movements are in phase, to be driven in each case with the same drive means. As a result of this, on the one hand the synchronous run of these nipper devices is guaranteed, and, on the other, the drive device is simplified. In order to guarantee a defined detaching process for the fibre tuft combed out by the individual nipper device in each case, it is proposed that the drive of the individual detaching device be coupled to the drive of the nipper device. This is particularly necessary if, during the detachment process, the detachment device carried out a pilgrim-step movement, which is necessary in order to apply the end of the fibre tuft to the end of the comber non-woven fleece material already formed.<br>
However, if such precautions are taken in order to carry out the piecing process of the detached fibre package following on from the detachment device, it is possible for the drive of the individual detachment device to be effected continuously, independently of the drive of the nipper device.<br>
To guarantee the combing process by the combing segment of the circular comb, it is further proposed that the drive of the individual circular comb be coupled to the drive of the nipper device. Depending on the design of the drive, this can be a mechanical coupling or, in the case of drive by means of electric motors, it may be an electrical coupling.<br>
If the nipper devices are driven by a common drive shaft, it is proposed that the transfer means for the drive of the nipper device, in order to correspond with the temporally offset<br><br>
oscillating movements, seen in the circumferential direction of the drive shaft, be secured to this shaft in a torsionally-resistant manner offset to one another.<br>
It is also possible, however, for an individual drive shaft to be allocated to each group of nipper devices, which carry out a simultaneous oscillation movement in the same direction, said shaft being connected by appropriate means to the individual nipper device. As a result, it is possible for the drive or drive means respectively to be designed and matched to the oscillation movement required. Expressed in general terms, a common drive means is used for the nipper devices which oscillate in the same manner in each case.<br>
With this device too, it is to advantage, if the detachment device carries out a pilgrim-step movement, for the drive of the individual detachment device to be coupled to the drive of the nipper device.<br>
If the actual piecing process takes place following on from the detachment device (such as a detachment roller), the drive of the individual detachment device can be effected continuously independently of the drive of the nipper device; in other words, the detachment device can, for example, exhibit a constant revolution speed.<br>
In order for the circular comb segment of the circular comb of the individual combing head to be matched to the different oscillation cycles, it is proposed, with the use of a common circular comb shaft for all the circular combs, that the circular combs be secured in a torsionally-resistant manner on the drive shaft in such a way that the comb segments are partially offset to one another, seen in the circumferential direction of the shaft. This offset, seen in the circumferential direction, is in each case to be matched to the individual oscillation cycle of the corresponding nipper device of the individual combing heads.<br>
It would therefore also be conceivable for the individual circular combs to be provided with an individual drive, such as was shown, for example, in CH-PS-681 309. Further embodiments of the invention can be derived from the following embodiment examples.<br><br>
These show:<br>

according to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic plan view with a combing machine 1, which is provided, for example, with eight combing heads K1 - K8 located next to one another. The fibre slivers F produced at the individual combing heads are delivered via a device, not shown in any further detail, onto a delivery table T, and conveyed lying next to one another to a following drafting device S. The fibre slivers are stretched in the drafting device S and then<br><br>
combined to form one individual fibre sliver FB, which is deposited in coils into a following can K of a sliver deposit BA, via a hopper wheel TR represented in diagrammatic form.<br>
At the opposite end of the sliver deposit BA the combing machine 1 exhibits a gear unit G, which is connected to a drive motor, not shown in any greater detail. All the devices of the comber 1 which are not provided with individual electric motor drives are driven by this gear unit G, via drive means not shown in any greater detail.<br>
In addition to this, Fig. 1 shows nipper devices Z1-Z8, represented in diagrammatic form, of the individual combing heads K1-K8. From this representation it can be seen that the nipper devices Z1-Z8 of the adjacent combing heads in each case are located in different operating positions. For example, the nipper device Z1 at the combing head K1 is located in a rear position, while the nipper device Z2 of the combing head K2 is located in a frontmost position, in which the detachment process takes place. The nipper devices Z1-Z8 are in drive connection with a crank driving mechanism Q, with an electric motor M1-M8 in each case. The electric motors M1-M8 are connected by means of a control line SL to a control unit ST, by means of which the individual motors are actuated.<br>
In the example shown, the detachment device AV which follows the nipper device Z1-Z8 is provided likewise with an individual electric motor drive M11-M18, by means of which the pilgrim-step movement of the detachment device AV is carried out. The drive motors M11-M18 are likewise connected via the control lines L1-L8 to the control unit ST.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a diagrammatic representation of a combing head corresponding to the embodiment according to Fig. 1, in a side view. In the representation shown, the position of the nipper device Z2 of the adjacent combing head K2 is shown. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the nipper device Z1 (Z2) consists of a cushion or lower nipper plate 4, which interacts with a upper nipper plate 5. The upper nipper plate 5 in this situation (not shown) is mounted so as to pivot about an axis of rotation on the lower nipper plate 4. As is likewise shown in diagrammatic form, the lower nipper plate 4 and the upper nipper plate 5 exhibit correspondingly designed profiles in their front end area, by means of which, with<br><br>
the nipper device closed (representation by broken lines), they clamp the lap W being conducted via a feed cylinder 6. The fibre tuft FB projecting out of the nipper device Z1 in this clamping position is combed by a comb segment 8 of a circular comb 9. The circular comb 9 arranged beneath the nipper device Z1 is secured in a torsionally-resistant manner on a circular comb shaft 10, which is connected via the drive connection 12 to the gear unit G. The drive of the gear unit G is provided by a main motor M. The nipper device Z1 (referred to in brief as the nippers Z1) is mounted so as to pivot by means of a pivot arm 13 (or two arms respectively) on the axis of the circular comb shaft 10. The free end of the pivot arm 13 in this embodiment is secured to the frame of the lower nipper plate 4. In the rear area, the lower nipper plate 4 exhibits an axis of rotation 15, on which a lever 16 is mounted so as to be capable of rotational movement. This lever 16 is secured by means of an axle 18 on a crank disk 19 so as to be capable of rotational movement. The axle 20 of the crank disk 19 is in connection with a drive motor M1 via a drive connection 21. The motor M1 is in connection with the central control unit ST via the control line SL In order to co-ordinate the electric motor drives M1 or M11 respectively with the drive of the circular comb 9, a sensor 22 is provided for, which is in connection with the control unit ST via the line 23. This sensor 22 has the task of detecting the individual angle setting of the shaft 10 of the circular comb 9 in each case and passing this to the control unit ST. This makes it possible for corresponding control pulses to be issued via the control unit ST to the individual motors M1, M11 in each case, so that, on the one hand, the comb segment 8 combs out the fibre tuft FB at a defined moment in time, and, on the other, the rotational movement of the pair of detachment rollers 2, or the pair of carrier rollers 3 respectively, is matched to the movement of the nippers. A device of this type with an individual electric motor drive for the detachment cylinder is provided, for example, from EP-PS 374 723.<br>
Fig. 6 represents a fixed comb 7 in diagrammatic form, which is arranged between the detachment rollers 2 and the nipper device Z1. The fixed comb 7 is, as a rule, secured to the frame of the lower nippers plate.<br>
For the sake of easier overview, the representation of further details, in particular with regard to the drive of the feed roller 6 and the initiation of the movement of the upper<br><br>
nipper plate 5, has been waived, and can in any event be derived from the literature reference cited, "Die Kurzstapelspinnerei" (Short Staple Spinning).<br>
In the position from Fig. 6 show with unbroken lines, the nipper device Z1 is shown in its frontmost position, in which it is open, and the fibre tuft FB which is combed out is placed at the end E of a non-woven fibre fleece material V which is partially conveyed back. In this position, the detachment rollers 2 or carrier rollers 3 respectively are driven in the forwards direction by the motor M11, so that the conveying of the non-woven fibre fleece material V, as represented in the direction of the arrow, is effected in the direction of a guide table 14. In this situation, the end of the fibre tuft FB comes into congruent cover with the end E of the non-woven fleece material V, and they are soldered to one another at the clamping point of the detachment rollers 2. In this process, the fibre tuft FB is drawn at least in part through the comb assembly of the fixed comb 7. As already described, the broken-line representation shows the position of a nipper Z2 of an adjacent combing head K2, whereby this is located in a rear position, in which the combing process actually takes place by combing out with the comb segment 8. Likewise indicated by a broken line is the drive motor M12 for the individual electric motor drive of the detachment device AV at the adjacent combing head K2.<br>
Due to the temporally displaced oscillation cycle of the nipper devices between two adjacent combing heads, the swings of the oscillations produced are directed in the opposite direction, so that these oscillation resonances can in part be relieved. As a result of this, the oscillations which are required to be accommodated by the base are substantially reduced. The bases therefore do not need to be over-dimensioned, and the machine frame of the combing machine can also be more lightly dimensioned as a result.<br>
A further positive effect is derived from a displacement of the piecing points on adjacent combing heads, which in the final analysis has a positive effect on the manufacture of a comber sliver in respect of its uniformity.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a further embodiment, whereby the nipper devices Z1-Z8 of the combing heads K1-K8 are moved to and fro by a common nipper shaft 25. The shaft 25 in this situation is connected to the gear unit G, in which a discontinuous movement of the shaft 25 is created by means of a thrust crank drive, not shown in greater detail. A gear device of this type is also represented in diagrammatic form, for example, on page 34 of the literature source cited, "Die Kurzstapelspinnerei" (Short Staple Spinning). In the present embodiment, too, the drive element, in this case the shaft 25, is likewise connected by means of a crank drive Q with the individual nipper device Z1-Z8 in each case. The nippers drive 25, as indicated in diagrammatic form, is mounted in the machine frame at several points by means of the bearings 26. Adjacent combing heads, likewise as in the example in Fig. 1, have an operating cycle offset by 180Â°. Due to the different operating cycles of adjacent combing heads, the drive of the individual detachment devices AV in each case, the drive of the individual detachment devices AV in each case must also be adjusted in accordance with the movement of the individual nipper devices Z1-Z8. Accordingly, the detachment devices AV of the combing heads are driven by a common gear system, with the same nippers movement pertaining at the heads. Thus, for example, the detachment devices AV of the combing heads K1, K3, K5 and K7 are connected by means of a drive connection, shown in diagrammatic form, to the gear unit G1, which is in connection with the gear unit G by means of the connection 29. The other detachment devices of the combing heads K2, K4, K6 and K8 are connected by means of the drive connection 30 to a gear unit G2, which is likewise connected via the connection 31 to the gear assembly G. The gear units G1, G2 may of course be integral constituent parts of the gear assembly G, and in the example shown are shown separately in order to provide a better explanation of the drive concept.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a diagrammatic side view of the combing head K1, whereby the position of the nipper device Z2 of the adjacent combing head K2 is represented as a broken line. The individual elements of this diagrammatic representation, as far as the drive elements, are essentially congruent with the elements already described in Fig. 6, as a result of which there is no need of further explanation of them here. The drive of the detachment rollers 2 and of the carrier rollers 3 respectively is effected in this situation by means of the<br><br>
connection means 28 by the gear unit G1, which is in connection with the gear assembly G via the path 29. The shaft 25 is in drive connection with the gear assembly G via the path 34. A pivot arm 32 is secured in a torsionally-resistant manner on the shaft 25 in the area of the individual combing heads in each case, e.g. K1. The torsionally-resistant securing is identified symbolically, for example, by the use of a screw 33, represented in diagrammatic form. Secured at the free end of the pivot arm 32 is the lever 16, capable of rotational movement by means of the axle 18. At the other free end, the lever 16 is connected in jointed fashion by means of the axle 15 to the lower nipper plate 4, so as to be capable of pivot movement. For the adjacent combing head K2, the pivot arm 32a is, for example, offset by 180Â° and secured in a torsionally-resistant manner on the shaft 25 by means of a screw 33, not shown in any greater detail. The pivot arm 32a and the lower nipper plate 4a are connected to one another with regard to drive by means of the lever 16a. In this situation, the lever 16a is mounted via the axles 15a and 18a respectively on the lower nipper plate 4a and the pivot arm 32a such as to be capable of rotational movement. As a result of this arrangement of the pivot arms 32 and 32a respectively, due to the intermittent rotational movement of the shaft 25 the nippers Z1 and Z2 respectively are set in opposed oscillation movement.<br>
Accordingly, with this device too, the oscillations engendered by the phase displacement of adjacent combing heads are for the most part compensated for, as a result of which the dynamic loading on the nippers shaft 25 is also reduced. The result of this is that the nippers shaft 25 does not have to be over-dimensioned, and the mechanical demands on the machine frame are also lower. At the same time, the loads on the base on which the machine is set up are also reduced.<br>
In this connection, further embodiments are also conceivable. For example, provision could be made for a separate drive shaft in each case for the groups of nippers which carry out the simultaneous oscillation movements.<br>
A variant of this type is indicated, for example, in Fig. 4a, whereby only the rear part of the nipper devices Z1 and Z2 respectively is shown. In this situation, the nipper Z1 is driven via the shaft 25, which in terms of drive is connected to the nipper Z1 by means of the<br><br>
lever 16, which is mounted in a rotationally movable manner in the axles 15, 18. For the nipper Z2, the drive is effected by means of the shaft 25a, which is in drive connection with the nipper Z2 via the lever 16a, whereby the lever 16a is mounted in the axles 15a, 18a in a rotationally movable manner.<br>
In the further embodiment of Fig. 3, in each case two adjacent combing heads (such as K1, K2 for example) are arranged in the same way in relation to the combing cycle. This means that, with the individual groups of gathered combing heads, the combing and detaching cycle takes place at the same time. Accordingly the detachment devices AV of the individual group of combing heads (K1, K2-K3, K4-K5, K6-K7, K8) are driven in each case by a common gear unit 35, 36, 37 or 38 respectively. In this situation, the gear units 35 and 37 are connected by means of a drive connection 40 and 41 respectively to the gear unit G3, which in turn is connected in terms of drive via the connection 43, represented diagrammatically, to the main gear assembly G. Via the drive connections 45 and 46, also represented diagrammatically, the gears 36 and 38 are connected in terms of drive to the gear unit G4, which is likewise in connection via the drive connection 48 with the gear assembly G. With this device too, due to the operating cycles of the nipper devices offset in groups, the oscillations which are incurred are for the most part compensated for.<br>
There are of course many other combinations of group formations and drive variations possible, which are not shown here. It would also be conceivable, for example, for the gear assembly G to be arranged between two groups of combing heads in each case, such as has been shown in diagrammatic form, for example, in JP-AS-7-26254. In addition, the number of combing heads can also be substantially greater than eight, as has been shown in the embodiments.<br>
The sliver deposit could in this situation be arranged, as shown in Fig. 9 of JP'254, on the opposite side of the individual group in relation to the gear assembly.<br><br>
In the further embodiment of Fig. 5, a design is shown which is identical to the embodiment in Fig. 4 as far as the drive of the detachment device. In this embodiment, the actual piecing process is no longer carried out at the detachment rollers 2, but has been relocated into the area of the carrier rollers 3. In order to compensate for the discontinuous delivery of the detached fibre packets 51, a plate 53 is provided for, capable of pivoting about a point of rotation 52, which transfers the fibre packet 51 delivered from the detachment rollers 2 to an end E1 of a non-woven fibre fleece material V already formed. The pivotable plate 53 functions in this situation as a kind of intermediate storage unit, by means of which the discontinuous delivery can be compensated for. A detailed description of this device and of other further possible embodiments can be derived from DE-A-1-197 13 225. With this device it is possible for the detachment rollers to be driven at a continuous (e.g. constant) revolution speed, as a result of which the drive of the detachment rollers 2 is independent of the particular position of the nipper device in each case. In the example shown, only the position of the plate 53 needs to be determined according to the comb play. If this is taken into account, the drive of the detachment rollers 2, the carrier rollers 3, and the pivot axle 52 can be effected from a common gear unit G1, which is connected via the drive path 29 to the gear assembly G. The decoupling of the drive of the detachment rollers 2 from the drive of the individual nipper in each case makes possible a large number of combinations of different combing cycles between the individual combing heads, without impairing the detachment process. Depending on the design of the following piecing device, its drive may under certain circumstances still be coupled to the drive of the nipper device. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the plate 53 is in the position shown by the broken line, in which the fibre packet 51 is brought partially into congruence with the end E1, as a result of which, when this congruence is effected between the carrier rollers 3, the piecing with the non-woven fleece material V takes place. With a device of this kind, an even greater possible variation of combinations of different combing cycles between the individual combing heads is possible. In this situation it is also possible for individual combing cycles to be provided for even with smaller temporal displacements.<br><br>
PATENT CLAIMS<br>
1.	A combing machine or comber (1) with several combing heads (K1-K8), which each includes a pivoting mounted nipper device (Z1-Z8) mounted on bearings so as to pivot, and in each case with a rotatably-mounted circular comb (9) with a comb segment (8) for combing out the fibre tuft (FB) delivered by the nipper device and a detachment device (AV) for detaching the combed-out fibre tuft from the nipper device, characterised in that the drive (M1-M8) and drive elements (Q, 16,18, 25) respectively for initiating the to-and-fro movement of the nipper device (Z1-Z8) are designed and arranged in such a way that at least one nipper device (Z1, Z3, Z5, Z7) carries out a temporally offset pivot movement in relation to the other nipper devices (Z2, Z4, Z6, Z8).<br>
2.	The comber (1) according to Claim 1, characterised in that the pivot movements of the nipper devices (Z1-Z8) of adjacent combing heads (K1-K8) in each case are temporally offset in relation to one another.<br>
3.	The comber (1) according to Claim 1, characterised in that the pivot movements of the nipper devices (Z1-Z8) of at least one group (K1,K2; K3,K4;K5,K6;K7,K8) of combing heads (K1-K8) arranged next to one another are temporally offset in relation to the pivot movements of the other nipper devices.<br>
4.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the different pivot movements of the nipper devices (Z1-Z8) are in each case opposed to one another.<br>
5.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that each combing head (K1-K8) is provided with its own drive motor (M1-M8) for initiating the pivot movements of the individual nipper device (Z1-Z8), which is connected to a central control unit (ST).<br><br>
6.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the combing heads (K1-K8), at which the pivot movements of the nipper devices (Z1-Z8) are in equal phase, are in each case in connection with a common drive means.<br>
7.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the drive (M11-M18; G1-G4) of the individual detachment device (AV) is connected to the drive (M1-M8; 25, G) of the nipper device (Z1-Z8).<br>
8.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the drive (M11-M18; G1-G4) of the individual detachment device (AV) is effected continuously independently of the drive (M1-M8; 25, G) of the nipper device (Z1-Z8).<br>
9.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the drive (10, G) of the individual round comb (9) is coupled to the drive (M1-M8; 25, G) of the nipper device (Z1-Z8).<br>
10.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that, for the drive of the nipper devices (Z1, Z3, Z5, Z7 and Z2, Z4, Z6, Z8 respectively) which carry out simultaneous oscillation movements in the same direction, a common drive shaft (25, 25a) is allocated, whereby transfer means (16, 32; 16a, 32a) for the drive of the individual nipper device are mounted on the one side in a jointed manner (15,15a) at the nipper device and, on the other, are mounted in a torsionally-resistant manner on the drive shaft (25, 25a).<br>
11.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a common drive shaft (25) is allocated to at least a part of the combing heads (K1-K8) operating with temporally different oscillation movements of the nipper devices (Z1-Z8), whereby transfer means (Q, 16, 32) for the drive of the individual nipper device are mounted on one side in a jointed manner (15) at the nipper device and, on the other, are mounted in a torsionally-resistant manner on the drive shaft (25), and<br><br>
that, in accordance with the temporally-offset oscillation movements of the nipper devices, the transfer means (32) are secured on the drive shaft (25), seen in its circumferential direction, partially offset to one another.<br>
12.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 10 to 11, characterised in that the drive (G1-G4) of the individual drive device (AV) is coupled to the drive (25, G) of the nipper device (Z1-Z8).<br>
13.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 10 to 11, characterised in that the drive (G1-G4) of the individual drive device (AV) is effected continuously, independently of the drive (25, G) of the nipper device (Z1-Z8).<br>
14.	The comber (1) according to one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that at least a part of the circular combs (9) of the individual combing heads (K1-K8) are mounted in a torsionally-resistant manner on a common drive shaft (10), whereby, in accordance with the temporally offset oscillation movement of the individual nipper device (Z1-Z8), the comb segments (8) are in part offset to one another, seen in the circumferential direction of the shaft (10).<br><br></td>
