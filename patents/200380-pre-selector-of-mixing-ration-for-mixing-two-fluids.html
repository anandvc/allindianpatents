				<td>This invention provides mechanical built in pre-selector of mixing ratio of two fluids to be mixed. There will absolutely be no change in mixing ratio when flow is varied and vice versa. Two devises for pre-selection of mixing ratio are disclosed in this invention, first one being a pre-selector of mixing ratio (501) with radial exit of mixed fluids, the other the other, a pre-selector of mixing ratio of the two fluids with axial exit (601). Figures 5to12d give details of the devices. The devices use reselector of mixing ratio having configured holes for first quality of manufacture and circular holes for second quality of manufacture. The pre-selectors of mixing ratio are devised to rotate by a pre-determined angle in desired ranges like 0-90&amp;#730; 0-180. the pre selectors can be used for pre-selection of mixing ratio of industrial fluids and also for pre- selection of temperature in water taps including washbasin taps.</td>

				<td>01. Technical field.<br>
The present invention relates to preselection of mixing ratio of mixing two fluids. The invention can be used for<br>
pre-selection of mixing ratio of gases and liquids which are miscible like alkali and water, acid and water,<br><br>
Kerosene and oil. hot water and cold water in case of taps, hydrogen and nitrogen etc. The invention can also be used for pre-selection of mixing ratio of fluids which react but which willl not precipitate solids or result in generation of excessive heat. This obviates need for expensive pneumatic and electronic pre-selectors of mixing ratio. The invention, which is purely a mechanical device, enables pre-selection of mixing ratio even when difference in inlet pressures is very vide. Only one pre-selector enables pre-selection of mixing ration avoiding too many levers and control devices for this purpose. The invention enables inexpensive pre-selection of temperature even for washbasin taps. The pre-selector is devised for radial exit of mixed fluids. Modified version of the pre¬selector enables axial exit of mixed fluids 02. Background art<br>
Fig-1 shows a mixer where in one fluid f1 enters a valve 1 and the other fluid f2 enters valve 2. Lever a controls flow of fluid f 1 and lever b controls flow of f2. When mixing ration has to be changed without changing flow, both the levers have to be operated. When flow has to be changed without changing mixing ration also, both the levers have to be operated. Even to stop flow, both the levers have to be operated. The process involves gusswork and is cumbersome,<br>
FlG-2 and Fig-3 show a water tap and a bathroom tap respectively, having two levers a and b, one of the levers controlling flow of cold water and other controlling flow of hot water. For changing flow without changing temperature, both the knobs have to be operated simultaneously. For changing temperature without changing flow, both the knobs have to be operated simultaneously. Both the knobs have to be operated even to stop flow, which is frustrating.<br>
Fig-4 shows a single lever type water tap where in, vertical movement of lever changes flow and horizontal movement changes temperature. When flow is being selected, temperature Is disturbed, At times, the lever is moved in wrong direction to vary temperature instead of flow, which can cause injury. These taps are not devised for pre-selection of temperature.<br>
Electronic and pneumatic pre-selectors of mixing ratio.<br>
Electronic and pneumatic pre-selectors of mixing ratio are too expensive requiring space and sophisticated control systems. It is not practical to use electronic or pneumatic pre-selectors of mixing ratio for example, in washbasin taps.<br>
Pressure equalizers for water taps.<br>
Pressure equalizers are too expensive and are mainly used in large multi-head custom shower systems and are too expensive for installation at each tap. These are not specifically shown in a figure, as only a dial with graduations is visible from outside.<br>
Disclosure of the intention.<br>
a. Following abbreviations are used, to describe this invention*.<br>
PrSMR: Pre-selector of mixing ratio,<br>
Fh:        Frame showing developed surface of bore in housings.<br><br>
b.  Following reference signs are used to describe this invention: ■<br>
01-PrSMR, (12-Hole in PrSMR for entry one of the fluids, 03-Hole in PrSMR for entry of other fluid. 04-Locating flange. 05 -Pin for fixing locating flange to PrSMR. 06 -Rectangular groove for fixing "0" rings. 07-Axral hole in PrSMR. 08 -Radial holes in PrSMR ending wrtti an annular area, for radial flow. 09- Recess in PrSMR. .<br>
c. The PrSMR.	^<br>
1. Angle of rotation of PrSMR: The invention enables pre-selectlon of mixing ratio by rotation of knob on PrSMR by a pre^Jetermined angle. The range of angular rotation can be selected as fractions of 360° namely C^S", c-SO", 0°-120° or 0°-180°. For practical purposes, range of rotatron of 0° to 90° and 0° to 180° are suffident. h^anufacUirers wilt have option to choose a range in iMtween ttie two. Higher range of 0°-180° gives -^ slowr txJt more accurate response and hence of superior quality. 0-180° range can be chosen v*ere accurate pre-selection is desired as in industrial mixers for pre-selection of mixing ratio. For water taps, 0°-90° gives fast and accurate enough response and is deemed adequate and appropriate for domesfe use, for use in hotels, etc. —^ In this description and drawings, 0°-90° range is used for description of this invention. An odd range like 0°-111 ° is also possible if so desired.<br>
ii.     Construction features of PrSMR.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig-5 v^ich gives details of a PrSMR (501), having a cylinder (501a) with outsWe diameter d, having a stepped stem with diameter +d" with recess (509) on one side for fixing knob for rotation of ttie PrSMR. A tilind axial hole (507) is drilled and plugged by a locating flange (504) and secured using pin (505). Rectangular grooves (506) are provided on ijid for fixing "0" rings as additional safety against leakages, in between locating flange (504) and stepped stem on the other side. On side of step, there are radial holes (508) . at right angles to each other connecting to the axial tiole (50?) and ending with an annular area wi ttie outside diameter, to facilitate radial disctiarge of mixed fluids.<br>
There are two holes in between rectangular grooves (506). Hole at bottom (502) shown partly, will be on sMe of locating flange (504) and in same plane as recess (509). Straight edge of configured hole, to be explained later, is shown in dotted line. Fig-5b shows cross section along xx of Fig-5, showing details of hole (5b02). For rotation range of 0°to 90° of PrSMR, the other hole (5c03) will be out of phase with respect to hole (502) hole (502) by 90° as shown In Fig-5c. The holes can be circular or configured. [Details of configured holes will be given in following pages. Only conflgured holes are shown in the drawings as circular holes can be easily visualized. Ftg-5a shows longitudinal section of PrSMR.<br>
Fig-5d shows PrSMR rotated by 45" clockwise, looWng from side of stepped stem, The straight edges of configured holes (5d02) and (5d03) will be in the same line and at bottom as shown by b. Line a, shown thnjugh the configured hole correspond to axial hole (5d07). Figures 5e and 51 showaoss section along mm and nn and h is housing of a mixer having an accurately machined bore in to which PrSMR is inserted. The housing has inlet holes (5d10) for entry of one fluid aid hole (5d11) for entry of the other fluid. At 45° rotation of PrSMR, configured holes (5e02) and (5fo3) are equally open to holes (5d10) and (5d11) of housing 1^. Referring to Fig-5e, when PrSMR is further rotated ctockvnse by 45°, hole (5e02) will be closed to hole {5e10) and hole {5fl)3)<br><br>
vflll be fully open to hole (5f11) ttius allowing only one fluid tlirough (5e11), When the PrSMRs are rotated anti¬clockwise by 45°, hole (5e02) will be In line with hole (5(10) and the other hole (5f03) wiii be closed to hole (Kl \) pi housing and only the first fluid will enter PrSMR.<br>
Fig-6"Shows a PrSMR with locating flange, radial holes and pin removed. Fluids f1 and f2 to be mixed, enter through holes (602) and (603) and mixed fluid f romes out axially from axial hole (607) of PrSMR. These PrSMRs can be used in axial mixing type mixers. Figures 6a and 6b are cross sections through yy and xx. Fig-6e shows PrSMR turned by 45°, looiung from side of stepped stem. Lines a sewi through ttie configured hole corresponds to axial htrie (6e07). Figures 6c and 6d show cross sections through pp and oo in Fig-Se.<br>
Fig-Sf shows circular hole for PrSMR hwing same diameter as holes in housing h. Fig-6g slwws shaded area to be removed to malte circular twle a configured hole. Bottom half of circular hole is made in to a rectangle to change it to a configured hole.<br>
Fig-8 shows frames fh corresponding to developed surface of bore in housing in to viihlch the PrSMR Is inserted, and filOl corresponding to developed surface of outside diameter of PrSMR. The developed surfaces are for full turn corresponding to 360°. Hence, height of frames will be identified in degrees c»ily. Both frames are in phase, superimposed on each other. Holes (810) and (811) in fh are inlet holes for fluids f1 and R and will be on sHne centerline, CL. Holes (802) and (803) are inlet holes in PrSMR having same center to center distance as in housing. Horizontal distance of holes ab corresponds to diameter of hole in frame fh and a"b" corresponds to oblong length of arc aob shown in Fig-5b. Frame fh is always fixed. (810) is inlet hole in housing fh forfluidfl and (811) is Inlet hole for fluid f2. (802) and (810), (803) and (811) are out of phase by 45° with respect to each other resulting in equal openings for witry of fluids, con-esponding to mid position of PrSMR at 45"".<br>
In Fig-8, shaded areas show that sum total of the hw shaded areas representing opening for passage of fluids is less than area of any one of the inlet holes in fh. This shows that at mid position of PrSMR, there is reduction in total flow.<br>
Fi^9 shovre thai frame f901 isoutolphaset(y45"=tofh.Holes(902)anti(910)areinpha8esupwimposed on each otfier showing that there will be full flow through hole (910) and there will be no flow through hole (903). This shows that at extreme positions, there will be full flow through one of the holes where as there will be no flow through the other hole and vice versa and there is reduction in sum total of flow in intentiedlate position v^en circular holes are made In PrSMR.<br>
Fig-10 shows the frames superimposed on each other showing use of configured holes (1002) and (1003), Sum total of the shaded areas will be equal to any one of the holes in fh showing that there will be no reduction in flow for any position of flOOl. 11 can be easily vfeualized that evert if frame ot tlOM moves from mid position, sum total of areas will be same equal to area of any one of the holes in fl\.<br>
Fig-11 shows frame fllOl and frame fh superimposed on each other for 180° rotation of PrSMR. ab is choral length equal to d and a"b", length of oblong portion which is half circumference of PrSMR. Holes (1110) and (1111} are in the same line and holes (1102) and (1103) are equally open to holes in fh. As in case of Fig-10, sum total of areas of shaded portions wll be constant equal to any one of the holes in fh. Figures 11a and 11b show relative position of holes (1102) and (1103) showng that the holes are equally open to holes in housing h.<br><br>
IN. Influence of angle of rotation on parameters of PrSMR.<br>
With reference to Fig-5c, opening (5c03) subtends an angle of 90° at center. With reference to Fig-5b, length of chord ab will be 2dsin45""/2=0,7071d showing that diameter of hole (5b10) in housing depends on angle of rotation of PrSMR. Further, length of arc aob will be 7td/4=0.785d. Ratio of arc to ct&gt;ord, which is diameter of holes in housing, will be 0.785/0.707=1,11. VWth this, when the PrSMR is devdoped on a plane surface, the hole will be oblong, the shorter side being equal to diameter of hole and longer side will be 1.11 d showing that the holes look oblong when developed on a plane surface.<br>
In Fig-lla, angle of rotation is 180° and opening (11a02) in PrSMR subtends an angle of 180° correspondinf) lo line ab. From Fig-lla, length of ab and diameter of inlet hole (11a10) will be equal to d confrrming that diameter of holes in housing and in PrSMR, depend on angle of rotation of PrSMR. With reference to Fig-1 la, ratio of arc aob to length ab will be (jcd/2)/1.57 showing that the hole vji)er\ developed on a plane surface will be more oblong fw 180" rotation compared to 90° rotation.<br>
Fig-12 shows PrSMR lor 180= rcftalion, (1202) and (1203) are holes in PrSMR, straight edge of hole (1202) is behind and partly shown and hence shown In dotted line. Fig-12a shows cross section abng xx of Fig-12. Fig-12e shows plan view of PrSMR with hole (1202) which is in bottom and hence shown in dotted lines. Fig-12b shows circular hole in PrSMR and also axial hole (12b07), Fig-12c shows shaded portion showing material to be removed for changing circular hole to configured hole. Fig-d shows conTigured hole, top half being a semicircle and bottom half being rectangular.<br>

05. Applications.<br>
a. Bathroom tap: Fig-13 shows a bathroom tap having PrSMR (1301) and h is housing of tap, (1310) and (1311) are inlet holes for fluids to be mixed. (1302) and (1303) are holes in PrSMR. When knob b is rotated, holes (1302) and (1303) of PrSMR open to holes (1310) and (1311) in housing h to select required mixing ratio. The fluids get mixed in axial passage (1307) of PrSMR, leave through radial hc^es (1308), enter vertical passage e, enter axial passage of flow controller through radial holes of flow controller c, and leaves Ihrmigh opening f of flow controller and through g in the housing. This enables pre-select required temperature by<br><br>
b. Parallel mixing type industrial mixer: Fig-14 shows an industrial mixer with housing h having twc acojralely bored holes in to one of which PrSMR (1401) is inserted, (1410) and (1411) are inlet holes in the housing h for the two fluids to enter. The fluids enter holes (1402) and (1403) in PrSMR, get mixed in axial passage (1407) of PrSMR, leave through radial holes (1408), enter axial passage of flow controller c, and mixed flow leaves through hole F of flow controller. Rotation of knob b enables pre-select required mixing ratio. Rotation of knob c enables select required flow. In Fig-14, two destinations are shown for mixed flow.<br>
c.	Washbasin tap: Fig-15showsawashbasint^wi&amp;iinletholes(1510) and (1511). (1502) and (1503) are<br>
holes in PrSMR (1501) with axial outlet. Fluids to be mixed, H and f2 enter through inlet holes (1510) and<br>
(1511), enter axial passage (1507) of PrSMR through holes (1502) and (1503), the fluids get mixed in the axial<br>
passage (1507) of PrSMR, mixed fluid enters axial passage of flow controller c and leaves through hole j in flow<br>
control!^ and through curved passage i to spout I. PrSMR is rotted by knob b which Is secured to stem of<br>
PrSMR using recess (1509). Fkiw controller is rotated using l^ob d. Flanges k prev^t axial movement of<br>
PrSMR (1501) and flow controller c. Inlet pipes are brazed to non-retum valves g with balls, f. The an-angement<br>
enables pre-select required temperature witttout va^ing flow using a single PrSMR and also enables select<br>
required flow by rotating knob d.<br>
d.	Axial mixing type industrial mixer: Fig-16 shows an axial mixer wi^ housing h. Fluids f1 and f2 enter<br>
Uirough inlet holes (1611) and (1610), and through holes (1603) and (1602) of PrSMR. The fluids get mixed in<br>
axial hole of PrSMR (1607) and leave PrSMR axiaify. The mixed fluids will enter axial passage of flow controller<br>
leaves through hole f of flow controiler and througti holes g. of tvausing.. Knob a is mounted on stem of PrSMR<br>
and secured by tightening against recess (1609). Knob b will be mounted on flow contnsller on similar way.<br>
Locating flanges d constrain axial movement of PrSMR and flow contnsller c. The ananganent enables pre¬<br>
select required mixing ratio without varying flow using a single PrSMR. The anangement also enables select<br>
required flow by rotating knob d.<br>
06. Manutacturing details and c^ons for rmnufacturers:<br>
a.	Material used for manufacture of PrSMRs should be SS-304 or superior. Stainless steel prevents<br>
deposition of scales on PrSMR when hard water Is used in case of water taps. For handling dilute acids, the<br>
PrSMRs has be made of SS-3161 and housing out of Teflon.<br>
b.	Out skle surface of PrSMR will be machined by turning keeping at least 0.3mm allowance for grinding. For<br>
first quality of manufacture, initiaify cirojlar holes will be drilled in the PrSMRs and then, configured hr^es made<br>
by milling w by arc erosion. For second quality, only circular holes will be used.<br>
c.	For first quality of manufacture, the PrSMRs will be turned keeping at least 0.3mm grinding allowance,<br>
plasma nitrided and then ground to a very smooth surface. This gives a surface hardness ckise to that of<br>
cemented cart)ide and can stand very rough usage. For second quality of manufacture, the PrSMRs will be<br>
ground and then nitrided in a nitriding bath.<br>
d.	Rectangular grooves for "0" rings vAl\ be made to standards of manufacturing country, or to international<br>
stendatds. Working clearances from 0.03 to O.OStrm are to be given deperiding on size Qf(^.<br>
e.	Manufacturers will have option to have range of rotation les than 0°-90°.<br><br>
07.  Statement of the prior art mixers, relating to mechanically operated mixers of this invention.<br>
t.	Prior art mixers use separate valves for mixing the two fluids to be mixed calling botti valves to be<br>
operated simultaneously, to determine mixing ratio resulting in ambiguity..<br>
ii.	Both the valves h»e to be operated for varying flow maintaining same mixing ratio of the two fluids.<br>
iii.        Advanced type of water taps for washbasins and baUtrooms use one operating liver, movement in one direction controlling temperature and movement in other direction controlling flow, calling for user to select required tanperature every time tap is operated without possibility for pre-selection, Fv.       Above mentbned taps use ceramic int^nals and when hard water is used, hard water deposits scales on ceramic internals hampering performance of taps.<br>
V.        Pneumatic and elecbonic mixers of fluids are expensive and control system for pre-selection is too complicated.<br>
vi.        Electronic pre-selectors of tempwature are mainly used in large multiple-head custom shower systems and are too expensive for installation on washbasins.<br><br><br>

A pre-selector of mixing ratio (501) for mixing two fluids, with a cylindrical surface of diameter d, having a stepped stem of diameter d" on one side, the stepped stem having a recess (509) for clamping a knob for rotation of the pre-selector of mixing ratio, having a drilled axial blind hole (507) which  is plugged by a locating flange (504) which is secured using a pin (505) and which also constrains the pre-selector against axial movement, the pre-selector (501) having two radial holes at right angles to each other ending with an annular area on the side of the stepped stem, having two holes (502) and (503) for entry of fluids to be mixed, the holes being configured with one half being a semicircle and the other half being a rectangle for first quality of manufacture, and being circular for second quality of manufacture, with rectangular grooves for fixing "0" rings for safety against leakage, the pre-selector constrained to rotate in a range of 0" to 90°, or 0° to 180°, or any range in between, smaller range giving fast and less accurate selection of mixing ratio, the higher range giving slower but more accurate selection of mixing ratio, fluids to be mixed entering through holes (502) and (503), getting mixed in axial hole (507) of the pre-selector of mixing ratio and leaving through radial holes (508) for radial exit.</td>
