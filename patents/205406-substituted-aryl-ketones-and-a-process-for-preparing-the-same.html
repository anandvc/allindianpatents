general formula (H) are known organic compounds.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as defoliants,<br>
desiccants, haulm killers and, especially, as weed killers. Weeds in the broadest sense<br>
10	are understood to mean all plants which grow in locations where they are undesired.<br>
Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially on the amount used.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in<br>
15	connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Abutilon, Amaranthus., Ambrosia, Anoda,<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way<br>
5	restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are suitable, depending on the concentration, for the total control of weeds, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks, and on paths and areas with and without tree plantings. Similarly, the active<br>
10	compounds according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in<br>
perennial crops, for example forests, decorative tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns, turf and pastureland, and for the selective control of weeds in<br>
15	annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal<br>
activity and a broad active spectrum when used on the soil and on above-ground parts<br>
of plants. To a certain extent they are also suitable for the selective control of<br>
20	monocotyledonous    and    dicotyledonous    weeds    in    monocotyledonous    and<br>
dicotyledononscrops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the<br>
invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial<br>
25	plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for<br>
the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat aU plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired<br>
30	and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants).<br>
Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders certificates. Parts of<br>
35	plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and<br>
organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds<br><br>
Le A 34 222-Foreign countries<br>
and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
5	The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of<br>
propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-<br>
10	layer coating.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances<br>
15	impregnated   with   active   compound,   and   microencapsulations   in   polymeric<br>
substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br>
20	optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants<br>
and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly suitable are: aromatics, such<br>
25	as  xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol, and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl<br>
30	isobutyl    ketone    or    cyclohexanone,     strongly    polar    solvents,     such     as<br>
dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals,<br>
such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diato-<br>
35	maceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina<br>
and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite and<br><br>
Le A 34 222-Foreign countries<br>
synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material,<br>
such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers<br>
and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example<br>
5	alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and<br>
protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers, such as carboxylmethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
10	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arable, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
15	It is possible to use colorants, such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide, Prussian blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
20	The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
For controlling weeds, the active compounds according to the invention, as such or in<br>
their formulations, can also be used as mixtures with known herbicides and/or<br>
25	substances which improve the compatibility with crop plants ("safeners"), finished<br>
formulations or tank mixes being possible. Also possible are mixtures with weed¬killers comprising one or more known herbicides and a safener.<br>

10	suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are used in a customary<br>
manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing or broadcasting.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be applied both before and<br>
after emergence of the plants. They can also be incorporated into the soil before<br>
15	sowing.<br>
The amount of active compound used can vary within a relatively wide range. It<br>
depends essentially on the nature of the desired effect. In general, the amounts used<br>
are between 1 g and 10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil surface, preferably<br>
20	between 5 g and 5 kg per ha.<br>

0.30 g of (2.7 mmol) of l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-pyrazole, 0.8 g (8.0 mmol) of triethylamine and a drop of N,N-dimethyl-formamide are added successively to a solution of 1.1 g (2.7 mmol) of 3-[2-(3',4'-dimethyl-l',2',4'-lH-triazolin-5'-on-l'-<br>
10	yl)-ethoxy]-2-methyl-4-methylsulphonyl-benzoyl  chloride  in  20  ml  of dichloro-<br>
methane. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (about 20°C), for about 24 hours, the reaction solution is washed successively with IN hydrochloric acid and saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over magnesium sulphate and the solvent is removed under water pump vacuum. The residue is dissolved in 30 ml of<br>
15	acetonitrile and, with slight cooling, admixed successively with 0.28 g (3.3 mmol) of<br>
2-hydroxyl-2-methylpropionitrile and 1.4 g (14 mmol) of triethylamine. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for another 24 hours, the major part of the solvent is removed under water pump vacuum and the residue is dissolved in dichloromethane and IN hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is separated off, washed with water and<br>
20	saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and filtered.<br>
From the filtrate, the solvent is carefully distilled off under reduced pressure.<br><br>

10	carbodiimide (DCC, 1.2 equivalents). The mixture is stirred at room temperature<br>
(about 20°C) for 15 hours, and 1.5 ml of triethylamine (2 equivalents) and 0.29 ml of trimethylsilyl cyanide (0.4 equivalents) are then added. After 2 hours at room temperature, the mixture is concentrated under water pump vacuum and the residue is stirred with 10% strength aqueous sodium carbonate solution and filtered off. The<br>
15	filtrate is shaken with diethylether and the aqueous phase is acidified with 2N<br>
hydrochloric acid. The precipitated product is extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane and the combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.<br>
20	This gives 1.3 g (53% of theory) of 2-[3- (3'-ethoxy-4'-methyl-r,2',4'-lH-triazolin-<br>
