DNA AND ALKYLATING AGENT AND DRUG EACH COMPRISING THE SAME<br>

3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the  invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel indole derivative for alkylating a specific base sequence of<br>
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).   The present invention also relates to an alkylating agent and a drug<br>
that contain the indole derivative.    Specifically, the present invention relates to a novel indole<br>
derivative  that particularly  suppresses  the  occurrence  of genetic  abnormalities  and  has high<br>
anticancer activity and significantly high reactivity.<br>
The present invention also relates to an alkylating agent and a drug that contain the indole derivative.<br>
Background Art<br>
Now that the elucidation of the gene arrangement of humans has been substantially completed, many researchers have focused on a molecule having the ability to specifically bind to a particular base sequence. Non-Patent Document 1 and the like show that Dervan et al. found that an antiparallel oriented "N-methylpyrrole"-"N-methylimidazole" polyamide (hereinafter, N-methylpyrrole being simply referred to as "pyrrole" or "Py"; and N- methylimidazole being simply referred to as "imidazole" or "Im") base-sequence-specifically binds to the minor groove of DNA. Furthermore, general rules that Py-Im recognizes a C-G base pair, Im-Py recognizes a G-C base pair, and Py-Py recognizes an A-T base pair or a T-A base pair have been derived.<br>
Various hairpin polyamides and cyclic polyamides have been synthesized by introducing a covalent bond into Py-Im in order to prevent the loss of entropy due to binding and to achieve stronger binding and the ability to recognize a sequence. A p-linker (NHCHzCHzCO-) and a y-linker (-NHCHzCHzCHsCO-) are typically known. It has been described that a hairpin polyamide containing the y-linker (-NHCHzC^CHzCO-) particularly has excellent binding ability and recognition ability. In addition, the structure of a complex between the hairpin polyamide containing the 7-linker and, DNA has been determined (see Non-Patent Document 2). P-P recognizes an A-T base pair or a T-A base pair. Similarly, the y-linker recognizes an A-T base pair or a T-A base pair. The y-linker has a y-turn structure represented by the bifurcate portion of a bent hairpin model. These molecules each have an association constant and specificity comparable to a transcription factor and the like. However, the regulation of gene expression is performed by inhibiting binding of the transcription factor.<br>
Thus, base sequences that can be targeted is significantly limited (for example, see Non-Patent Document 3).<br>
The inventors have developed a hybrid molecule of a Py-Im polyamide bound to a segment A (Du) serving as an alkylating moiety of duocarmycin A, which is an antibiotic.<br>
and filed an application (for example. Patent Document 1). The hybrid molecule selectively alkylated one site of a DNA fragment of 450 base pairs on the basis of the sequence recognition ability of the Py-Im polyamide (for example, see Non-Patent Document 4). However, completion of the reaction requires several days. Furthermore, the reaction efficiency was as low as several percent. In contrast, the inventors found that ImPyLDu86 containing a vinyl linker (L) disposed between a functional group (hereinafter, referred to as an "alkylating moiety") for alkylating DNA and the Py-Im polyamide dimerizes and selectively reacts with both chains at sites thereof located 5 base pairs apart in a 5'-YG(A/T)CR-3' sequence (wherein Y represents a pyrimidine base; and R represents a purine base) at a low concentration to cause alkylation with an efficiency as high as 70%. That is, the inventors found considerable improvement in reactivity and efficiency by introducing the linker moiety (for example, see Non-Patent Document 5).<br><br>

Disclosure of Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, the hybrid molecule described in Non-Patent Document 5 has problems related to difficulty of synthesis, the lability of the linker moiety, the reactivity of the alkylating moiety, and the like. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel pyrrole-imidazole polyamide compound for alkylating the specific base sequence of DNA, the polyamide compound being capable of being synthesized through fewer reaction steps than known hybrid molecules and having a combination of a high reactivity in DNA alkylation and the ability to recognize a sequence. Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an alkylating agent and a molecule serving as a drug, the alkylating agent and the molecule containing the polyamide compound. Means for Solving the Problems The inventors have conducted intensive studies and found that the use of a pyrrole-imidazole polyamide compound having an alkylating moiety at a terminus thereof via an indole linker solved the problems described above. This finding resulted in completion of the present invention That is, an indole derivative of the present invention is represented by general formula (I):<br>
**.<br><br>

wherein R1 represents a functional group for alkylating DNA; R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyi group, or an acyi group; and X represents a divalent group having one constitutional unit or having two or more constitutional units which may be the same or different, the constitutional unit being represented by the following formula:<br><br>

An alkylating agent of the present invention for alkylating DNA is composed of the indole derivative<br>
of the present invention described above.<br>
An inventive drug contains the alkylating agent of the present invention and suppresses or activates<br>
the expression of a gene.<br>
Advantages<br>
An indole derivative of the present invention is a functional molecule selectively alkylating a specific base sequence present in a gene. The indole derivative can change a target base sequence by changing the configuration of imidazole, pyrrole, and the like in its molecule. Furthermore, a method for synthesizing the indole derivative is practical and highly applicable in view of the production of a wide variety of derivatives. Therefore, it is possible to logically design a drug on a genetic level, the drug being applicable to an important gene arrangement or an abnormal gene derived from a disease, such as cancer, in the human genome.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
An indole derivative of the present invention is represented by general formula (1):<br><br>
ftl<br><br>
Jl<br><br>
R
(1)<br>
wherein X represents a divalent group having one constitutional unit or having two or more constitutional units which may be the same or different, the constitutional unit being represented by the following formula:<br><br>
M<br><br>
A<br>
9Y"<br><br>
or<br><br>
-W**<br><br>
wherein among the constitutional units, a terminal constitutional unit adjacent to R2 may be a constitutional unit represented by the following formula:<br><br>
or<br><br>
-{CHj)),-<br><br>
I      O	n<br>
wherein m and k are each an integer of 0 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, and more preferably 2 to 3. Furthermore, the number of constitutional units is not particularly limited but appropriately selected depending on a DNA sequence targeted for alkylation. Usually, the number of constitutional units is preferably 1 to 20 and more preferably 2 to 7. The sequence of the constitutional units is not particularly limited but appropriately selected depending on a DNA sequence targeted for alkylation to design a polyamide.<br>
A DNA sequence recognized by the indole derivative of the present invention complies with the known general rule in principle. That is, Py-Im recognizes a C-G base pair; Im-Py recognizes a G-C base pair; Py-Py recognizes an A-T base pair or a T-A base pair; and β-β,γ-γ or the like recognizes an A-T base pair or a T-A base pair. Furthermore, β-β, γ- γ- or the like not only recognizes the base pair but also constitutes the trifurcate portion of a bent hairpin model. As has been generally known, in rare cases, a mismatch occurs depending on sequences around a target DNA sequence. For example,<br>
-4-<br><br>
in an AT-rich sequence, Im-Py and the like adjacent to the y-turn structure in a hairpin-shape<br>
molecule often misrecognize.<br>
In an indole linker, which is the advantage of the compound of the present invention, two of Im, Py,<br>
and the like relative to one indole can form a pair. Two of Im, Py, and the like to form a pair are not<br>
necessarily needed. One of Im, Py, and the like may be used. Indole tends to recognize C or T similar<br>
to recognition by Py.    Furthermore, the alkylating moiety of the indole derivative of the present<br>
invention alkylates the N-3 position of a purine base, in particular, the N-3 position of adenine.<br>
The alkylating moiety represented by Rl in the above- described formula (1) is not particularly<br>
limited.   Any moiety having the abilities to recognize and alkylate a specific base sequence in DNA<br>
may be used.   Preferred examples of the alkylating moiety, i.e., Rl, include moieties represented by<br>

The moiety of S-CBI represented by formula (3-S) includes the three-membered ring having the same configuration as that of the naturally existing Du moiety represented by formula (5). The indole derivative represented by formula (1) in which Rl is represented by formula (3-S) has alkylating activity. In contrast, the indole derivative represented by formula (1) in which Rl is the moiety of R-CBI represented by formula (3-R) has significantly weak alkylating activity and is thus inactive. R2 in formula (1) represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, or an acyi group. The alkyl group and the acyi group (portion excluding CO) usually has a carbon atom number of 1 to 20 and preferably 1 to 10.

A DNA-alkylating agent of the present invention is composed of the inventive indole derivative<br>
represented by general formula (1).<br>
The indole derivative of the present invention used as the alkylating agent may have a hairpin<br>
structure to recognize DNA. Alternatively, the indole derivative may dimerize to recognize DNA.<br>
In addition to the hairpin structure and the dimerization, DNA may be recognized by adding a<br>
compound having one divalent constitutional unit or having two or more constitutional units which<br>
may be the same or different, the constitutional unit being represented by the following formula:<br><br>
,'<br><br>
1   o<br><br>
or<br><br>
-(CMJV<br><br>
(wherein n is an integer of 0 to 10), wherein among the constitutional units, a terminal constitutional unit adjacent to an N-terminus may be a constitutional unit represented by the following formula:<br><br><br>
1<br>
W<br><br>
or<br><br>
-(CHj)v<br><br>
(wherein q is an integer of 0 to 10). That is, a base pair may be recognized by pairing the compound with different indole derivative (1) of the present invention. Furthermore, a base pair may be recognized by pairing the compound with a known minor-groove binder.<br>
A drug of the present invention contains the alkylating agent of the present invention and thus suppresses or activates the expression of a gene.<br>
Examples of the gene suppressed or regulated include abnormal genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). And oncogenes. The inventive indole derivative used as an active component compound of the drug of the present invention may be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.   Examples   of  the  salt  include  commonly  used  salts,   such  as  salts  with  acids,  e.g.,<br>
-8-<br><br>
hydrochlorides, phosphates, citrates, and sulfonates, and salts with organic bases, e.g.. methylamine<br>
and ethylenediamine.<br>
The indole derivative or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof has advantages described as<br>
follows:<br>
(a)	the effect of the compound can be expected in a small amount because of high uptake by cancer cells ;<br>
(b)	the compound can be expected to be orally absorbed because the compound is stable in an acid or an alkali;<br>
(c)	it is possible to control the expression of a specific gene; and<br>
(d)	no damage to normal cells is caused compared with known DNA alkylating agents.<br>
The drug of the present invention is expected to have a therapeutic effect on various diseases by controlling the expression of a gene. In particular, the drug is useful for the treatment and prevention of cancer and can be used for deep cancer. When the drug is used as an anticancer agent, the drug is formed into a commonly used formulation, such as an injection, a tablet, a powder, or a capsule. In making the formulation, a commonly used, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as a binder, a lubricant, a disintegrator, a solvent, a dispersant. a stabilizer, a pigment, or a flavor, may be used. The content of the indole derivative in the formulation is different depending on types of indole derivative and formulation and is usually 0.2 to 50 percent by weight.<br>

Ability to Alkylate Linear DNA (400 bp or more)<br>
The reaction of compounds (3-1) and (4-1) prepared in the above-described Synthesis Examples with DNA was studied using the long-chain DNA (pUC-II1; sequence No. 7). An alkylation reaction was performed at 23°C for 8 hours. The sequence alkylated was analyzed by polyacrylic gel electrophoresis for sequence determination. Fig. 1 shows the results. Open-circular compound (4-1) and circular compound (3-1) had the same sequence specificity and was selectively alkylated adenine located at site 1 (5'-CGGCCA-3') at nanomolar concentrations. This sequence specificity can be explained by a model in which each compound dimerizes in the DNA minor groove to recognize the base sequence.<br>
Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the following process: A standard<br>
reaction solution containing the 5'-Texas Red-end-labeled DNA fragment (10 nM), DMF (10% (v/v)).<br>
and an agent having a concentration described above in a sodium phosphate buffer (5 mM, total<br>
volume: 10 (AL, pH = 7.0) was charged into a microfuge tube (Eppendorf) and left standing at 23°C<br>
for 8 hours.   After completion of the reaction, the reaction was   quenched by the addition of calf<br>
thymus DNA (1 mM. 1 [AL). The resulting mixture was shaken at 90*0 for 5 minutes.   The DNA<br>
obtained by centrifugation under reduced pressure was dissolved by the addition of 8 AiL of loading<br>
dye (fushin red<br>
solution in DMF), shaken at 94°C for 20 minutes, and then immediately cooled to 0°C. A 2-pJi aliquot<br>
was separated electrophoretically on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel<br>
using a Hitachi 5500-S DNA sequencer. The following tests were conducted in a similar way.<br>
The reaction of compounds (3-2) and (3-3) prepared in the above-described Synthesis Examples with DNA was studied using the long-chain DNA (pUC-II; sequence No. 4, pUC-I'; sequence No. 1). An alkylation reaction was performed for 8 hours. The sequence alkylated was analyzed by polyacrylic gel electrophoresis for sequence determination. Fig. 2 shows the results. As a result, in both compounds (3-2) and (3-3), efficient DNA alkylation comparable with that of a known Py-Im polyamide having a vinyl linker was observed at nanomolar concentrations. However, the difference in sequence recognition ability was observed. In compound (3- 3), alkylation of site 4 (5'-AGCCA-3'). which was a match sequence, was observed. On the other hand, single-base-pair mismatch sequences in site 1 (5'-AGCTA-3'), site 2 (5*- AGTCA-31), site 5 (5'-TACCA-3'), and the like were also observed. In contrast, in compound (3-2), alkylation in only site 3 (5'-TGACCA-3') and site 6 (5'-AGTCCA-3'), which were match sequences, was observed. From the stand point of the sequence recognition ability, the molecular design of compound (3-2) was excellent. Interestingly, although pUC-I' (sequence No. 1) contained a site (5'-TGCCG-3') corresponding to a match sequence of compound (3-3). No alkylation of guanine was observed.<br>
In consideration of the results shown in Fig. 2. it is believed that the combination of the indole linker and CBI alkylates adenine at the N-3 position with highly sequence specificity. In sequence recognition, it is believed that the indole linker adjusts the distance between the cyclopropane ring of CBI and the N-3 position of adenine so as to cause alkylation while functioning as like Py (Fig. 3).<br>
The reaction of compounds (3-2), (3-4), and (3-5) with DNA was studied using the long-chain DNA (A-F10906; sequence No. 8). The DNA-alkylating ability of each compound was evaluated. Fig. 4 shows the results. Sequence-specific DNA alkylation (site 2 and 3: 5'-TGACCA-3'. site 4: 5-AGACCA-3'. site 5: 5-TGTCCA-3') by compound (3-2) was observed at nanomolar concentrations as in the results shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, Sequence-specific DNA alkylation (site 6: 5'- AATCCA-3'. site 7: 5-TAACCA-3') by compound (3-4) was also observed at nanomolar concentrations. In compound (3-5), alkylation of an only mismatch sequence (site 1: 5'-TGCTCA-3') was observed. These results indicate the possibility that in the molecular design of the hairpin Py-Im polyamide including the indole linker, alkylating agents that are capable of recognizing intended sequences can be produced by only changing the configuration of Py-Im.<br>
Establishment of the synthetic pathway using the indole linker made it possible to synthesize an alkylating agent, which cannot be synthesized using a known vinyl linker, having the ability to<br>
-15-<br><br>
recognize a longer base sequence. For example, a Py-Im carboxylic acid having the ability to recognize a long base sequence was prepared by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis for a Py-Im polyamide using an oxime resin, thus making it possible to synthesize compound (3-6) shown in Synthesis Example 7. Alkylation of the DNA fragment (sequence No. 11) derived from pQBI63 was studied. The results demonstrated that compound (3-6) efficiently alkylated 1,000-base-pair DNA at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 5). Furthermore, alkylation (site 2) due to 1-bp- mismatch recognition was observed. However, alkylation of AT-rich base sequences (sites 1 and 3) was also observed.<br>
In the Py-Im polyamide, such as compound (3-6), having the ability to recognize a long base sequence, the maintenance of high specificity is an important issue. It is believed that further optimization of the   current molecular design makes it possible to produce a practical alkylating agent having the ability to recognize a sequence having 10 base pair or more with excellent versatility.<br>
Stability of Hairpin Polyamide<br>
Analysis of stability under acidic and alkaline conditions by HPLC was performed by the following process: A reaction solution containing compound (3-1) or (4-1) (100 uM) in a total volume of 10 [uL of an aqueous solution of 5% HC1 (pH = 1, DMF:H20 = 1:9) or an aqueous solution of 5% NaHCOa (pH = 9, DMF-.H20 = 1:9) was charged into a microfuge tube (Eppendorf) and left standing at 37°C. After 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours, analysis of compound (4-1) (16.8 min) and compound (3-1) (15.1 min) was performed by HPLC (linear gradient of acetonitrile 0-100% in 50 mM ammonium formate, 20 min, flow rate: 1.0 mL/min, 254 ran).<br>
The Py-Im polyamide containing the indole linker was evaluated for stability by product analysis on HPLC using compounds (4-1) and (3-1). Fig. 6 shows the results. It was found that compound (4-1) was not hydrolyzed at all in the acidic aqueous HC1 solution (pH = 1) (left standing at 37°C for 24 hours). Compound (4-1) was converted into compound (3-1) (30 minutes: 50%, 2 hours: 78%) in the alkaline aqueous NaHCOs solution (pH == 9) (left standing at 37°C for 24 hours). No other hydrolysates were formed. Compound (3-1) was readily converted into compound (4-1) (30 minutes: 96%) in the acidic aqueous HC1 solution (pH = 1) (37°C). That is, it was found that the Py-Im polyamide containing the indole linker was stably present in a seco- CBI form like compound (4-1) under the acidic condition (pH = 1) and in a CBI form like compound (3-1) under the alkaline condition (pH = 9).<br>
Sequence-Specific Alkylation of DNA by Polyamide Heterodimer<br>
A Py-Im carboxylic acid having the ability to recognize a sequence and a minor-groove binder can be provided by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis for a Py-Im polyamide. Thus, compounds (3-7) and (6) can also be prepared by Fmoc solid- phase synthesis as shown in Synthesis Examples 8 and 10. Alkylation of the 727-bp DNA fragment (sequence No. 14) by compound (3-7) was studied. As a result, efficient alkylation of sites 1 and 2 based on a hairpin mode of recognition and of site 3 based on a linear-chain mode of recognition by compound (3-7) was observed at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 7). Interestingly, a heterodimer was formed in the presence of compound (6) (500 nM), which was a minor groove binder,, and alkylation (site 4) based on accurate 10-base-pair recognition was observed. It was found that the synergetic effect of two molecules of compounds (3-7) and (6) resulted in the ability to recognize a long base sequence. This finding is important in view of the expansion of the recognition by the Py-Im polyamide.<br>
DNA Alkylation Targeting Telomeric Sequence<br>
A continuous base sequence, i.e., 5'-GGGTTA-3', is present at each terminus of DNA in a cell. It is suggested that the base sequence is greatly associated with growth and replication of cell. Alkylation of the DNA fragment (446 bp; sequence No. 17) containing 24 repeats of a telomeric sequence by compound (4-3) was studied. Efficient telomeric-sequence-specific alkylation (5'-ACCCTA-3') in a hairpin mode of recognition by compound (4-3) was observed at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 8).<br>

An alkylating agent containing the Py-lm polyamide having an indole linker has a high degree of flexibility in molecular design, thereby possibly recognizing various target base sequence.<br>
Anticancer Activity in vitro by Hairpin Polyamide<br>
To examine the activity of the Py-lm polyamide (3-2) containing the indole linker, which showed the most satisfactory sequence-specific alkylation, evaluation was made on 39 cultured human cancer cell lines, such as breast cancer cell line and prostate cancer cell line (Fig. 9). The axis of ordinates of the bar graph shows the 39 cultured human cancer cell lines. The value "0" of the abscissa axis refers to the mean log ICso value. A longer bar extending rightward means that the compound has a higher effect on the corresponding cancer. In contrast, a longer bar extending leftward means that the compound has a lower effect on the corresponding cancer. Compound (3-2) has relatively strong activity against cultured human cancer cells (mean log Icso value of 39 cell lines is about -7 (100 nM)) and thus "shows interesting anticancer activity. Evaluation of the anticancer activity on the 39 cultured human cancer cell lines from breast cancer cell line to prostate cancer cell line was made by screening test performed in The Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.<br>
HCT-116 (human colon cancer-derived cell). HeLa (human cervical cancer-derived cell), HLC-2 (human lung cancer- derived cell), and SH-SY-5Y (human neuroblast-derived cell) were treated with AcImlmPyPy-Y-ImPy-Indole-CBI (3-2) (10"5 to 10'8 M with 0.1% DMF) for 48 hours to evaluate the effect of the compound as an anticancer agent. As a result, 50% cell growth inhibitory concentration (ICso) against HCT-116, HeLa. HLC-2, and SH-SY-5Y were 7.42 x 10"8, 5.97 x 10"8. 5.35 x 10"8, and 7.43 x 10"9 M, respectively. Similarly, evaluation of 293T (human kidney-derived normal cell) and WI-38 (human normal fibroblast) were made, and ICso was 6.99 x 10"8 and 6.79 x 10"8 M, respectively. The results indicated that the anticancer activity of the compound (3-2) against the cancerous cell lines was about 10 times that against the normal cell lines (ICso values were calculated with reference to a system as a control treated with 0.1% DMF for 48 hours).<br>
Evaluation of anticancer activity was made by the following process: HCT-116, HeLa. HLC-2, and SH-SY-5Y cell lines were seeded into a 96-well flat bottom plate in complete media [RPMI1640 (HCT-116, SH-SY-5Y; Sigma-Aldrich Co.) each containing 10% fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified minimal media (HeLa. HLC-2, 293T, WI-38; Sigma- Aldrich Co.)] at cell densities of 4.0 x 103, 3.6 x 103,1.6 x 103, 7.0 x 102, 5.0 x 102, and 8.0 x 102 cells/well and were precultured for 24 hours in a COz incubator. The media were replaced with complete media containing 0.1% DMF and 10"5 to 10"8 M AcImlmPyPy-Y-ImPy-Indole-CBI (3-2). Incubation was performed for 48 hours in the C02 incubator. Then, 10 uL/well of a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories) was added. The specimens were left standing for 2 hours in the C02 incubator. Absorbance was measured with a microplate reader MPR-A4I (Tosoh Corp.).<br>
Anticancer Activity in vivo of Hairpin Polyamide<br>
Antitumor activity of compound (4-2) against transplantable human ER(+) breast cancer Br-10 in nude mice was studied. Human ER(+) breast cancer Br-10 was subcutaneously transplanted in dorsal portions of 8-week-old BALB/cA-nu/nu mice through a trocar. Injection of 0.1 mL of EP Hormone Depot was intramuscularly administered in Br-10-rransplant mice simultaneously with the transplantation. When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm3, the mice were divided into 5 mice/group, and then the administration started.<br>
Compound (4-2) was dissolved in ethanol, diluted with physiological saline, and subcutaneously<br>
injected in divided doses into 3 or 4 portions near the tumor once a day and 3 times every 3 days. The<br>
dose of compound (4-2) was 50 mg/kg (about lmg/mouse) in a volume of 0.05 mL/10 g.<br>
Physiological saline was subcutaneously injected in the control group.   The length of the major axis<br>
(L) and the length of the minor axis (W) were measured every 3 days.<br>
The tumor volume was calculated with the following formula: Tumor volume (mm3) = L (mm) x W2<br>
(mm2)/2<br>
Comparison of the tumor volume between the compound (4-2) treated group and the control group<br>
was performed.   Table 1 shows the results.   Values shown in the table show relative estimation of<br>
-17-<br><br>

compound (4-2)	1.0	1.1	1.4	1.4	1.5	2.0.<br>
T/C (%)	100	78.6	82.4	66.7	55.6	64.5<br>
From Table I, in the group in which subcutaneous injection of compound (4-2) was performed, the<br>
suppression of tumor growth was observed after the first administration<br>
The subsequent administration showed further significant suppression of the tumor growth.   In this<br>
experiment, toxicity that causes the weight loss of mice and the like<br>
was not observed.<br>
