METHOD OF PURIFYING LANTIBIOTICS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0001]	 Resistance of bacteria to conventional antibiotics used to treat human disease<br>
has risen to an international crisis level. A contributing factor has been the widespread use<br>
of antibiotics to treat non-life-threatening infections. In recent years, there has been much<br>
focus on a promising new class of bacteriocins known as lantibiotics. At present, lantibiotics<br>
are being used extensively by the food industry. Lantibiotics have significant commercial<br>
value and broad applicability, and practical methods for their production would have a<br>
significant economic impact.<br>
[0002]	 Bacteriocins are antimicrobial proteins produced by bacteria that display growth-<br>
inhibitory activity against a range of related bacteria. Lantibiotics are polypeptide<br>
antimicrobial agents that are produced by certain bacteria and are distinguishable from other<br>
antibiotics because of their polypeptide nature and bioactive properties. For example nisin,<br>
which is used as a preservative for certain foods, has the unusual amino acid residues,<br>
lanthionine and (3-methyl-lanthionine. Nisin, a lysine-rich lantibiotic, is non-toxic to humans<br>
and animals, is resistant to high temperatures and is bacteriostatic at very low<br>
concentrations. Unfortunately, although lantibiotics are versatile and have unique and<br>
advantageous properties, the lack of commercially viable methods for isolation at high purity<br>
has limited their utility.<br>
[0003]	 Analysis of the opportunity for the use of nisin by the dairy industry is illustrative of<br>
the impact of the lack of cost-effective purification methods. Recently, the potential value of<br>
nisin for the milk industry has been recognized, in particular, in connection with the ability of<br>
nisin to help fight mastitis infection in cows. The advantage offered by nisin stems, in large<br>
part, from its potential to reduce or eliminate "withhold period" rules. The withhold period is a<br>
time established, during treatment of mastitis infection of cows, when milk from the infected<br>
cow must be discarded. Thus, milk from cow treated for mastitis infection with nisin may<br>
enter the fluid milk stream much sooner than traditional antibiotic treatment.<br>
[0004]	 Unfortunately, nisin that is commercially produced by currently available methods<br>
of production and purification is considered food grade quality and is not of sufficient purity<br>
for pharmaceutical applications. It contains peptide impurities that cause inflammatory<br>
reactions when administered to cows. Therefore, due to the lack of efficient alternative<br>
methods of purification which could selectively remove such impurities, the value derived<br>
from treatment of mastitis with nisin is insufficient to counterbalance current practices.<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-2-<br>
Therefore, a method is needed that improves lantibiotic purity and that is practical to employ<br>
on a commercial scale.<br>
[0005]	 To be commercially practical, a purification scheme must be relatively high yield<br>
and low cost. With regard to lantibiotic production, it is relatively simple, inexpensive, and<br>
routine to culture an organism that either naturally expresses, or has been engineered to<br>
express, the desired bacteriocin. Invariably, however, the lantibiotic must be separated from<br>
the myriad of proteins that are co-expressed by the organism and that represent<br>
contaminating impurities in the initial preparation. Because lantibiotics are polypeptides, and<br>
hence share biochemical features with other proteins, the challenge has been in designing a<br>
practical protocol that is able to discriminate between the lantibiotic and the other protein or<br>
polypeptide impurities.<br>
[0006]	 With few exceptions, the use of proteases or enzymes having protease-like<br>
activity is avoided in protein purification protocols in light of the fact that the protein to be<br>
purified is typically sensitive to such treatment. For example, trypsin can not be used in a<br>
method for purifying a peptide that contains internal lysine or arginine residues because<br>
trypsin recognizes such residues and cleaves a protein or polypeptide containing such<br>
residues at their location. Moreover, purity and recovery of a protein, using a protease-based<br>
purification scheme, can be inversely related. This means that, under conditions that favor<br>
increased recovery of the protein of interest, impurities tend to remain insufficiently digested.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007]	 The present invention relates to a method for purifying a lantibiotic from a crude or<br>
partially purified solution containing the lantibiotic. In preferred embodiments, the lantibiotic<br>
is nisin, although the common structural features of lantibiotics govern the effectiveness of<br>
the disclosed purification methods for other members of the lantibiotic genus. The method<br>
includes the step of forming an incubation mixture comprising the solution containing the<br>
lantibiotic and a proteolytic enzyme, and incubating the mixture under conditions which are<br>
optimized for the selective proteolytic activity of the enzyme, thereby digesting non-lantibiotic<br>
protein, polypeptide and peptide components of the solution containing the lantibiotic, while<br>
leaving the lantibiotic substantially undigested.<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-3-<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0008]	 Lantibiotics are a group of ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified<br>
peptides containing unusual amino acids. Such amino acids include the thioether amino<br>
acids lanthionine (Lan) and/or MeLan, in addition to a number of modified residues, such as<br>
2,3-didehydroalanine (Dha) and 2,3-didehydrobutyrine (Dhb). The presence and influence of<br>
these residues on the structure and activity of lantibiotics has been the subject of significant<br>
research efforts.<br>
[0009]	 It has been observed, for example, that the sequence-specific dehydration of<br>
serine (to Dha) and threonine (to Dhb) results in modified amino acids with electrophilic<br>
centers which can react with neighboring nucleophilic groups. The thioether lanthionine is<br>
formed when the double bond in Dha is attacked by the thiol (SH) group of a neighboring<br>
cysteine residue. As a consequence of the presence of these intramolecular bridges,<br>
lantibiotics are polycyclic structures containing a number of lanthionine rings. The presence<br>
- of these lanthionine rings is thought to be essential for a number of important lantibiotic<br>
properties including, for example, maintenance of peptide rigidity and resistance to thermal<br>
inactivation.<br>
[0010]	 The present invention is based on Applicants' surprising discovery that a crude or<br>
partially purified preparation of a lantibiotic can be subjected to protease treatment under<br>
conditions which result in selective proteolytic activity against protein or polypeptide<br>
impurities, without measurable proteolysis of the lantibiotic. The use of such conditions<br>
represents an effective method for the purification of a lantibiotic.<br>
[0011 ]	 The prior art teaching which relates to the sensitivity of lantibiotics to protease<br>
digestion is mixed. Many of these reports relate specifically to the well-studied lantibiotic,<br>
nisln. For example, Gross et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93(18) (1971) 4634-4635) reported that<br>
nisin was trypsin-sensitive. A contradictory report was later published by Wilimowska-Pelc<br>
(Acts Microbiol. Pol A 8(1) (1976) 71-77). More recently, Chan et al. (Int. Food Microbiol. 390<br>
(2001) 267-281) reported that nisin is subject to tryptic digestion, but at a reduced rate. In<br>
summary, one of skill in the art, familiar with relevant teaching of the prior art, could not have<br>
predicted with any degree of certainty that it would be possible to identify conditions under<br>
which non-iantibiotic protein, polypeptide and peptide impurities present in a crude or partially<br>
purified lantibiotic containing solution could be selectively degraded by the action of a<br>
proteolytic enzyme, without substantially degrading the lantibiotic present in the solution.<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-4-<br>
This discovery is particularly important given the long-felt need for an improved, cost-<br>
effective, high purity method for lantibiotic purification which yields a lantibiotic preparation<br>
suitable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
[0012]	 The conditions for protease digestion determined to be effective in connection<br>
with the present invention can be characterized as selective. That is, the conditions<br>
established for the incubation that includes the impure lantibiotic and a proteoiytic enzyme<br>
are conditions under which the proteoiytic enzyme operates selectively to degrade non-<br>
lantibiotic impurities. Parameters which can be varied to modulate these selective conditions<br>
include altered pH ranges, reduced protease to lantibiotic ratios, reduced temperatures, etc.<br>
This listing of parameters which can be altered to optimize the selective operation of the<br>
proteoiytic enzyme is not intended to be comprehensive as those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize other parameters that can be altered to effect the desired goal.<br>
[0013]	 One of skill in the. art can readily determine optimal conditions for a particular<br>
proteolytic enzyme. If produced commercially, the manufacturer typically provides such<br>
Information in packaging materials shipped with the enzyme. Alternatively, it is a matter of<br>
routine experimentation to empirically determine such conditions.<br>
[0014]	 Optimal conditions, however, are not necessarily selective conditions. Under<br>
incubation conditions which are optimal for a given proteoiytic enzyme, both the lantibiotic, as<br>
well as protein or polypeptide impurities, may be degraded. Generally speaking, selective<br>
conditions are empirically determined. A starting point for such a determination is the<br>
manufacturer's recommended optimal condition. If, under these conditions, both lantibiotic<br>
and impurities are degraded, the conditions may be "de-tuned" arrive at the selective<br>
conditions. For example, as discussed below, the reported optimal pH for the enzyme trypsin<br>
has been reported to be about 8.0. However, the optimized selective conditions described in<br>
the Specification include, under otherwise identical incubation conditions, a pH within the<br>
range of about 5.50 to about 6.25.<br>
[0015]	 In the Exemplification section which follows, the extensively studied lantibiotic<br>
nisin was employed. However, as indicated above, representatives of the lantibiotic genus<br>
share a number of structural features, some of which have been identified as contributing to<br>
their relative resistance to proteolysis. Lanthionine rings, for example, have been specifically<br>
cited in this regard. Thus, while the Exemplification section focuses primarily on the<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-5-<br>
lantibiotic nisin, the principles established herein would be expected to apply to all lantibiotics<br>
due to the presence of their defining structural characteristics. Other lantibiotics include, for<br>
example, subtilin, epidermin, gallidermin, mutacin, pep5, epicidin, epilancin, lacticin,<br>
cytolysin, staphylococcin, salvaricin, lactocin, streptococcin, sublancin, carnocin, variacin,<br>
cypemycin, connamycin, duramycin, ancovenin, mersacidin and actagurdine.<br>
[0016]	 The methods of the present invention are particularly well-suited to the proteolytic<br>
purification of a lantibiotic present in crude or partially purified fermentation broth. In the.<br>
fermentation of nisin, for example, peptide analysis by GC/MS/MS has identified over 40<br>
peptides that co-purify with nisin. The Exemplification section which follows clearly<br>
demonstrates the effectiveness of trypsin in the degradation of the co-purifying impurities.<br>
[0017]	 With respect to the proteolytic activity of trypsin, the optimal pH has been reported<br>
to be about 8.0. Under otherwise identical incubation conditions, the optimized selective<br>
conditions described in the Specification include a pH within the range of about 5.50 to about<br>
6.25. Similar conditions fall within the selective range for other proteases including, for<br>
example, endopeptidase Arg-C, thermolysin, V8 protease, subtilisin, proteinase K, pepsin,<br>
papain, clostripain, lysyl endopeptidase, endopeptidase Asp-N, enterokinase, or Factor Xa.<br>
Preferably, conditions for selective digestion of nisin impurities by these other proteases<br>
comprise pH in the range of about 5.50 to 6.25. In the preferred embodiment, the pH is 5.80.<br>
With respect to pepsin, a pH of 3.5 is within the selective limits.<br>
[0018]	 The selective protease digestion conditions, as defined by the selective digestion<br>
of non-lantibiotic impurities, can be achieved in a variety of ways. This can include, for<br>
example, low protease to lantibiotic ratio, decreased temperature, altered pH, etc. The<br>
various relevant parameters can be altered independently or in combination.<br>
[0019]	 Following completion of proteolytic digestion, it may be desirable to remove the<br>
protease. A particularly convenient method for facilitating removal of the protease following<br>
digestion is to provide the protease attached to a solid support (e.g., an agarose or a<br>
magnetic bead). In this format, the solid support is easily separated from the incubation<br>
mixture following digestion. Alternatively, simple sizing column steps may be employed to<br>
effect removal of the protease. Other techniques 1OT removing proteases iottowing proteotyfc<br>
digestions are known in the art, including chromatography techniques such as those based<br>
on affinity, ion exchange, and hydrophobicity. *<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-6-<br>
[0020]	 It should be noted that although it may be desirable to remove the proteases after<br>
the impurities have been digested, it is not necessary to do so for all applications. For<br>
example, if the purified lantibiotic is intended to be consumed with a food product, the<br>
protease may not have to be removed in order to satisfy relevant regulations. For example,<br>
trypsin has been granted Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status for certain food<br>
applications.<br>
EXEMPLIFICATION<br>
Nisin is sensitive to proteolvsis by trvpsin at neutral to slightly alkaline pH and high trypsin to<br>
nisin ratio<br>
[0021]	 Nisin has two internal lysine residues that are potential targets of the proteolytic<br>
enzyme trypsin. To determine whether nisin could be digested by trypsin, a digestion<br>
reaction mixture was prepared where a nisin preparation, partially purified nisin from a<br>
fermentor run, was exposed to trypsin under conditions optimal for trypsin activity. These<br>
conditions included a reaction pH of 7.0 and a nisin to trypsin ratio of about 10:1 (w/w).<br>
Samples were incubated at 30°C and allqoutes were removed for analysis every 24 hr,<br>
beginning at time zero. Coomasie blue staining of SDS-PAGE demonstrated that, under the<br>
conditions employed, nisin was degraded by trypsin. Moreover, quantitative HPLC analysis<br>
of nisin at the various time points revealed that nisin recovery began to diminish by 24 hours<br>
following exposure to trypsin. After 96 hr of treatment, more than 90% of nisin was<br>
degraded.<br>
Nisin is resistant to trypsin digestion at low pH and low trvpsin to nisin ratio<br>
[0022]	 Peptide analysis has identified over 40 peptides that co-purify with nisin. All of<br>
these peptides have been identified as being products of Lactococcus fermentation. Since it<br>
was determined that nisin, at neutral to slightly alkaline pH and high trypsin to nisin ratios, is<br>
subject to proteolysis by trypsin, conditions were altered in an attempt to identify conditions<br>
under which trypsin would not degrade nisin but would degrade the peptide impurities in the<br>
nisin sample. Reaction mixtures containing nisin preparations, at a concentration of 11<br>
mg/ml, and USP grade trypsin at a concentration of 27.5 µg/ml, were incubated overnight at<br>
room temperature (400:1 w/w). The pH of the mixtures ranged from 5.25 to 6.5. While<br>
minimal hydrolysis of both nisin and impurities occurred below pH 5.50, quantitative HPLC<br>
analysis indicated that recovery of nisin was best at or below pH 6.25. These results<br>
indicated that conditions involving dilute trypsin and pH between 5.50 and 6.25 are optimal<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-7-<br>
for removal of peptide impurities from nisin preparations with minimum loss of nisin to tryptic<br>
digestion.<br>
[0023]	 To further optimize the conditions for removal of peptide impurities from nisin<br>
preparations by tryptic digestion, two liters of partially purified nisin was prepared at 4.55<br>
mg/ml and incubated with 25 mg of USP grade trypsin for 16 hrs at 30°C in 10 mM citric acid,<br>
pH 5.80. HPLC analysis revealed an overall nisin recovery of about 95%. Moreover,<br>
subsequent removal of trypsin using a molecular weight cut off membrane yielded a recovery<br>
of 87.5% nisin and 0.38% trypsin.<br>
[0024]	 To determine whether insoluble trypsin treatment of nisin preparations was also<br>
effective in digestion of impurities, but not nisin itself, 1.6 liters of partially purified nisin<br>
prepared at 9.55 mg/ml was treated with 1.6 ml of TPCK treated insoluble trypsin bound to<br>
beaded agarose. After 6 hr of incubation at 30°C, and following removal of insoluble trypsin<br>
by centrifugation, the overall nisin recovery was about 90%.<br>
Trypsin-treated nisin retains antimicrobial activity<br>
[0025]	 Treatment of nisin preparations with trypsin, under the conditions described<br>
above, does not affect the physical structure of nisin as judged by mobility on a reverse<br>
phase HPLC column or migration by SDS-PAGE. To confirm that the biological activity of<br>
nisin is also unaltered, in vitro bactericidal activity assay was performed. Trypsin-treated<br>
nisin was analyzed for antibacterial activity against a mastitic isolate of Streptococcus<br>
agalactlae (strain #20) in a 96 well plate assay and bacterial growth was read as absorbance<br>
readings on an ELISA reader. These experiments demonstrated that the antimicrobial<br>
activity of trypsin-treated nisin is not substantially different than the activity of the control,<br>
untreated nisin.<br>
Trypsin treatment reduces the inflammatory factors present in impure nisin<br>
[0026]	 Bovine intra-mammary infusion of impure nisin stimulates the production of high<br>
levels of somatic cells in milk as part of an inflammatory reaction. As shown in Table 1, non-<br>
mastitic cows treated with an infusion of 30 mg partially purified nisin have somatic cell<br>
counts that are greatly elevated. In contrast, somatic cell count of milk from quarters treated<br>
with an infusion of trypsin-purified nisin is much lower and is not statistically different from<br>
quarters treated with buffer alone.<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-8-<br>
Other proteases exhibit selective activity towards impurities over nisin<br>
[0027]	 Nisin is comparatively resistant to proteolysis by trypsin under the optimized<br>
conditions described above. To determine whether nisin is also resistant to other proteolytic<br>
enzymes under similar conditions, partially purified nisin was exposed to pepsin, thrombin,<br>
V8 protease (Endo Gluc), subtilisin, papain, thermolysin, or clostripain at pH 5.80. Pepsin<br>
exposure was also performed at pH 3.50. The results showed that nisin was resistant to<br>
proteolytic digestion by the enzymes. Pepsin at pH 5.80 and thrombin appeared ineffective<br>
against the impurities as well. At pH 3.50 pepsin was effective at digesting nisin impurities,<br>
but did not digest nisin. These results demonstrate that, under the low pH conditions and<br>
nisin to protease ratios described for trypsin treatment, other proteases also exhibit selective<br>
activity towards impurities over nisin.<br>
METHODS<br>
Trypsin digestion<br>
[0028]	 Tryptic digestion of nisin (50 mg) was carried out in 50 ml of a buffer consisting of<br>
25mM sodium acetate, 6 mM Tris acetate, 5 mM CaCI2, and pH 7.0. One ml of USP grade<br>
trypsin (5mg/ml) was added followed by incubation at 30°C. Thereafter, 500 µl aliqouts of<br>
trypsin were added at times 24,48,72, and 96 hours. At each time point in the experiment, 2<br>
ml aliquots were removed for further analysis, of which 100 µl was immediately plated on<br>
blood agar plates for determination of contamination. The remaining 1.8 ml was stored at<br>
-20cC until the end of experiment for SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis.<br>
Protease digestions<br>
[0029]	 For treatment of nisin with soluble trypsin, 2 liters of partially purified nisin from a<br>
fermentation product was prepared at 4.55 mg/ml in 10 mM citric acid buffer and 5 mM<br>
CaCI2. After addition of 25 mg of USP grade trypsin, the reaction mixture was incubated<br>
overnight at 30°C. The weight ratio of nisin to trypsin was approximately 400:1 (w/w). NaOH<br>
was used to adjust the pH of the digestion reaction to a range between 5.25 to 6.50. Nisin<br>
recovery and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and HPLC. Digestion reactions were<br>
terminated by lowering the pH to 3.0 using 3N HCl. Based on the results, a pH of 5.80 was<br>
selected and used in ail subsequent reactions involving other proteases.<br>
[0030]	 Digestion experiments using pepsin (EC3.4.23.1), thrombin (EC3.4.21.5), V8<br>
protease (EC3.4.21.19), subtilisin (EC3.4.21.62), papain (EC3.4.22.2), thermolysin<br><br>
WO 2004/033704 	PCT/US2003/031986<br>
-9-<br>
(EC3.4.24.27), and clostripain (EC3.4.22.8) were performed essentially as described for<br>
trypsin and at pH 5.80. Pepsin digestion was also performed at pH 3.50. For trypsin<br>
digestions using trypsin linked to a solid matrix (e.g. insoluble trypsin), 1.6 liters of partially<br>
purified nisin was prepared at 9.5 mg/ml in 10mM Tris HCI and pH 5.50. Following the<br>
addition of 1.6 ml of TPCK-treated trypsin bound to beaded agarose (Sigma Chemical<br>
Company), the reaction mixture was incubated at 30cC for 6 hours with frequent agitation.<br>
Insoluble trypsin was removed by centrifugation at approximately 4000 x g for 7 minutes.<br>
The resultant supernatant containing nisin was prepared for HPLC analysis.<br>
Mammary infusion<br>
[0031 ]	 Non-mastitic cows were treated with an infusion of vehicle, untreated, and trypsin-<br>
treated nisin (30 mg/10 ml) in the quarter after the 4th, 5th, and 6th milkings. The somatic cell<br>
count of the milk was recorded before, during, and after milking. High somatic cell counts<br>

sided t-Test comparisons with unequal variance.<br>
Biological activity of nisin<br>
[0032]	 Nisin activity was determined using an antibacterial assay against a mastitic<br>
isolate of Streptococcus agalactiae (IC 20) in a 96 well plate assay. Test samples were<br>
serially diluted into M17 10% lactose medium and then mixed with an equal volume of 104<br>
cfu/ml. After 66 hr of incubation at room temperature, the plates were read on an ELISA<br>
reader at 450 nm. Wells containing bacterial growth gave high absorbance readings. The<br>
data was analyzed using a four-parameter curve-fitting software.<br><br>
