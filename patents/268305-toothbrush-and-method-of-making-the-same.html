				<td>TOOTHBRUSH AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[01] The present invention relates to a toothbrush having a unique mounting of the<br>
cleaning elements, which is particularly beneficial in forming a contoured cleaning<br>
profile, and especially a contoured profile formed of tapered bristles. The present<br>
invention also pertains to a novel process for making such a toothbrush.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[02] A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from tooth<br>
surfaces, the gums, the interproximal areas between adjoining teeth, and the marginal<br>
areas between the teeth and gums. Toothbrushes have been provided with a myriad of<br>
cleaning elements and profiles in an effort to provide comfort and enhanced cleaning.<br>
For example, toothbrushes with bristle tufts presenting a contoured profile have long<br>
been provided for more effective cleaning of the teeth and gums. Additionally,<br>
tapered bristles have been used for increased comfort and better cleaning of the<br>
interproximal areas.<br>
[03] However, the combined beneficial effect of tapered bristles and a contoured<br>
profile has not been realized. Typically, bristles are fixed into the head of a<br>
toothbrush and then trimmed to obtain the desired profile. This conventional process<br>
of trimming the bristles has hindered the adoption of tapered bristles into<br>
toothbrushes; i.e., tapered bristles have heretofore been limited to fiat profiles to avoid<br>
trimming off of the tapered ends.<br>
[04] Further, the conventional manufacturing process for toothbrushes requires<br>
multiple steps to obtain a contoured profile, including the fixing of bristles into the<br>
head and one or more steps of trimming and endrounding of the fixed bristles.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
[05] The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with a unique mounting<br>
construction for the cleaning elements. This construction is especially effective in<br>
forming contoured cleaning profiles with tapered bristles.<br>
[06] In one aspect of the invention, cleaning elements are secured within the head<br>
at varying depths to enable greater versatility in cleaning arrangements and an<br>
improved manufacturing process<br>
[07] In another aspect of the present invention, tapered cleaning elements extend<br>
from a head of a toothbrush so as to form a contoured cleaning profile for more<br>
effective cleaning.<br>
[08] In another aspect of the invention, tapered bristles are uniquely mounted<br>
within the head of a toothbrush to define a contoured cleaning profile. In one<br>
construction, tapered bristles formed of different lengths are secured to the head in an<br>
arrangement to form the desired profile. In another construction, tapered bristles are<br>
secured at varying depths of insertion into the head to define the desired contoured<br>
cleaning profile.<br>
[09] In another aspect of the invention, a toothbrush is formed by fixing cleaning<br>
elements into the head of the toothbrush at varying depths. Alternatively, tapered<br>
bristles having alternative lengths can be fixed into the head. With either of these<br>
processes, a contoured cleaning profile can be formed without trimming and<br>
endrounding of the cleaning elements. The elimination of such conventional postfixing<br>
step(s) can enhance the manufacture of such brushes. Moreover, with this<br>
process, tapered cleaning elements can be effectively used in a toothbrush having a<br>
contoured profile.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[21] Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a toothbrush 10 according to the present invention.<br>
The toothbrush 10 includes a handle 12, a neck 14 and a head 20. Cleaning elements<br>
50 usually in the form of tufts 30 are fixed to head 20 for cleaning the teeth and gums<br>
of a user. The cleaning elements are preferably tapered bristles (see, e.g., Figures 3<br>
and 4), although they could be formed of non-tapered bristles or various forms of<br>
elastomeric or other cleaning members including tapered and/or non-tapered<br>
elements. As illustrated in Figures 2 and 5, the tufts 30 and their associated cleaning<br>
elements 50 preferably form a contoured cleaning profile (i.e., the collective profile of<br>
the remote ends of the cleaning elements adapted to engage the teeth) on head 20 for<br>
enhanced cleaning. While a simple bowed profile of the cleaning elements is<br>
illustrated in the figures, virtually any contoured profile could be used.<br>
[22] In one construction, head 20 includes a mounting surface 24 having a plurality<br>
of spaced holes 40 each receiving a tuft 30 of tapered bristles or other cleaning<br>
element(s) 50. The holes 40 can be formed to each receive the same number and type<br>
of cleaning elements or a different number or type of cleaning elements. For<br>
example, a plurality of the holes 40 can receive single tooth care elements 50, such as<br>
massaging elements, while the remaining holes 40 receive tufts 30 of tooth care<br>
elements 50, such as bristles.<br>
[23] In one embodiment, each bristle 50 has an anchoring portion 54 and a pair of<br>
strands 55 which extend to terminal ends 52 (Fig. 3). Anchoring portion 54 is adapted<br>
to be secured within a hole 40, typically with a plurality of other bristles to form a tuft<br>
30. Strands 55 extend outward from head 20 to engage and clean the user's teeth and<br>
gums. Each of strands 55 may be tapered as shown in Figure 3. Alternatively, one<br>
strand may be tapered 55' while the other strand 55" is not (Figure 4). The untapered<br>
strand 55" may not be as tall as the tapered strand 55' so as to not interfere with the<br>
brushing action of the tapered strand 55". The tapered working ends 52 are better<br>
able to enter the areas between the teeth and between the teeth and gums, and go<br>
deeper between them for effective cleaning. In either case, such bristles are referred<br>
to herein as tapered bristles 50. Further, such bristles may be formed of fibers,<br>
elastomeric material, etc., and have strands of equal or unequal lengths, virtually any<br>
cross-sectional shape, and uniform or varying cross-sectional shapes.<br>
[24] As shown in Figure 3, tapered bristles typically include strands with a nontapering<br>
base portion 56 proximate the mounting surface 24 and a tapering working<br>
portion 60 to engage the teeth and gums of the user. Tapered portion 60 of each<br>
cleaning element 50 extends between a point A and the working end 52. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, cleaning elements 50 are each free of a taper between their<br>
anchoring portion 54 and point A. As examples only, point A can be between about<br>
6.5 mm and 12 mm from the corresponding end 52. In one preferred embodiment,<br>
Point A is located about 10.5 mm from the terminal end 52. Nevertheless, point A<br>
could vary toward or away from anchoring portion 54 or the strands could be tapered<br>
along their entire lengths. Moreover, the bristles could have only one strand or be<br>
split into more than two strands. Also, the same features can be included in cleaning<br>
elements that are not bristles.<br>
[25] In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, the bristles or other cleaning<br>
elements 50 each preferably have the same length (although this is not essential). The<br>
holes 40 that receive these cleaning elements 50 have varied depths of insertion<br>
relative to a reference plane 70 to create the desired contoured cleaning profile.<br>
Reference plane 70 is generally parallel to a plane of engagement with the user's teeth<br>
(i.e., an imaginary plane that generally extends along the outer surfaces of two<br>
adjacent teeth) and coextensive with the outer-most portion of the mounting surface.<br>
In this embodiment, the reference plane is coextensive with mounting surface 24. In<br>
one construction, tufts 30 are fixed in holes 40 such that the strands 55 extend out<br>
from mounting surface 24 and away from head 20. The depth of the holes 40<br>
determines the extension of the cleaning elements from the mounting surface 24 so as<br>
to create the contoured cleaning profile. As can be appreciated, adjacent holes 40 can<br>
extend the same distance or different distances into the head 20 from the mounting<br>
surface 24.<br>
[26] In one example, a first hole 42 extends a first distance LI into head 20 from<br>
mounting surface 24 (Fig. 5). A second hole 44 extends a second distance L2 into<br>
head 20 from mounting surface 24. The second distance L2 is, in this example, larger<br>
than the first distance. However, the second distance could be less than the first<br>
distance (or the same) depending on the desired contour of the cleaning profile.<br>
Likewise, head 20 can include a third hole 46 that extends a third distance L3 into the<br>
head 20. This third distance can be greater or less than either or both of the first and<br>
second distances. As can be appreciated, any number of holes provided at different<br>
depths could be used. In the example of Figure 5, head 20 includes multiple holes 42<br>
that extend at the first depth, multiple tuft holes 44 that extend at the second depth,<br>
and multiple tuft holes 46 that extend at the third depth.<br>
[27] Holes 40 are generally circular in cross section, although they can have any<br>
shaped cross section including square, rectangular, diamond, crisscross-shaped, etc.<br>
In one example, holes 40 have a diameter of between about 1.2 and 2.0 mm and<br>
depths generally extending about 2-5 mm. Nevertheless other diameters and depths<br>
could be used as desired.<br>
[28J Tapered bristles are generally manufactured at set lengths for use in<br>
toothbrushes. As discussed above, bristles having the same lengths can be used to<br>
form contoured cleaning profiles without trimming and endrounding of the terminal<br>
ends. Further, the use of bristles manufactured at different lengths can also be used to<br>
define a contoured cleaning profile with or without varying the hole lengths or the<br>
depths of insertion of the bristles into the head. As seen in Figure 5A, a first set of<br>
tapered bristles 50a of a first length are secured within holes 40a. Similarly, a second<br>
set of tapered bristles 50b of a second length, shorter than the first length, are secured<br>
within holes 40b. In this construction, holes 40a and 40b all have the same depth<br>
from mounting surface 24'. Nevertheless, as can be appreciated, the securing of<br>
differently sized tapered bristles in the head can be used define various cleaning<br>
profiles. As an example only, the tapered bristles may be formed to have total lengths<br>
of 30 mm and 26 mm respectively. Due to the folded nature of the bristles in use, this<br>
will create a difference of about 2 mm in the projecting lengths of the tufts 30a, 30b<br>
extending from head 20'. Other lengths and additional numbers of different lengths<br>
can be used to define the desired contoured cleaning profiles. The bristles may also,<br>
of course, be fixed within the head by means other than anchoring within a preformed<br>
hole. Finally, a combination of varying holes and varying bristle lengths can<br>
be used to cooperatively form virtually any contoured profile with tapered bristles.<br>
{29] While Figure 5 illustrates holes having uniform shapes and orientations, the<br>
depths of insertion could be varied in other alternative ways. For example, holes 47<br>
could be formed with angled or curved sections 48, 49 that are bent relative to each<br>
other.(Figures 6 and 7). In this illustration, a first section 48 extends generally<br>
perpendicular to the axis 65 of the head, and a second section 49 extends within head<br>
20 at an angle to the first section. In the illustrated example, second sections 49 are<br>
angled about 45 or 90 degrees relative to the first section. However, the second<br>
section could have nearly any angled orientation relative to the first section.<br>
Additional angled or curved sections (i.e., more than two) can also be used to further<br>
increase the depth of insertion of the cleaning element. As can be appreciated, the<br>
depth of insertion is the length as measured along the cleaning element. Accordingly,<br>
the insertion depth of cleaning elements in holes 47 (or molded into the head with the<br>
same shape) is the sum of lengths of sections 48, 49. The use of such non-linear<br>
sections permits the holes to have different depths of insertion without extending<br>
farther into the head. Moreover, even if the holes do extend different distances from<br>
mounting surface 24, the thickness of the head can be reduced with the non-linear<br>
embedded sections.<br>
[30] Cleaning elements 50 inserted into a common hole 40 are considered to be<br>
fastened at a common point below their bases 56 and to be part of the same tuft 30.<br>
Similarly, a single tuft of cleaning elements (e.g., bristles) is considered to have the<br>
same height from the head even if there are small differences in their extensions. The<br>
cleaning elements 50 can be secured in the tuft holes by any known technique<br>
including, for example, stapling, pinning or gluing. The cleaning elements may also<br>
be anchored into the head by other means not including the pre-forming of a hole,<br>
such as molding the cleaning elements into the head (e.g., in mold tufting or anchor<br>
free tufting). Irrespective of the manner of fixing the cleaning elements in the head,<br>
they can be secured into the head at varying lengths or depths of insertion, and with or<br>
without embedded sections that are bent.<br>
[31] Other alternatives of the invention include the use of heads with non-planar<br>
mounting surfaces 24. For example, head 20a may include a recess 72 forming an<br>
upper mounting surface 24a and a lower mounting surface 24b (Figure 8). In this<br>
example, bristles extend into the head beyond their respective mounting surfaces 24a,<br>
24b an equal distance - irrespective of whether they are mounted in pre-formed holes,<br>
molded into the head, attached in another way. In such an embodiment, the bristles<br>
are fixed in the head at different depths of insertion relative to the reference plane 70a.<br>
In this case the reference plane is coextensive with the upper mounting surface 24a.<br>
[32] Another alternative head 20b includes a curved mounting surface 24c (Figure<br>
9). Although the bristles or other cleaning elements may extend into the head a<br>
uniform distance from mounting surface 24, they each have a different depth of<br>
insertion relative to the reference plane 70b. This reference plane is generally parallel<br>
with a plane of engagement with the user's teeth during use and extending from the<br>
outer-most portion of the mounting surface. Of course, non-linear embedded sections<br>
can also be used in any of the heads with non-planar mounting surfaces.<br>
[33] A common feature of each of these embodiments is that the depth of insertion<br>
is varied relative to a reference plane that extends generally parallel to the plane of<br>
engagement formed by the teeth during use, and which extends from an outer-most<br>
portion of the mounting surface (i.e., outer in the sense of the projecting direction of<br>
the cleaning elements from the head). The depth of insertion is determined by the<br>
length the cleaning element extends from the reference plane. The linear length of the<br>
cleaning element from the plane is the linear distance along the axis of the cleaning<br>
element (whether the element having linear or bent embedded sections) rather than an<br>
actual distance from the reference plane to the remotest portion of the cleaning<br>
element. In common toothbrushes with a planar mounting surface, the reference<br>
plane is co-extensive with the mounting surface. However, with non-planar mounting<br>
surfaces, the reference plane will be considered to extend from the outer-most portion<br>
of the mounting surface.<br>
(34] In any of the above-discussed embodiments, the cleaning elements 50 can<br>
extend outwardly from head 20 in a direction generally perpendicular to mounting<br>
surface 24 (see, e.g., Fig. 5) or disposed at various angles relative to mounting surface<br>
24" of head 20" (see, e.g., Fig. 5B). Thus, it is possible to select the combination of<br>
cleaning element configurations, materials and orientations that deliver the intended<br>
oral health benefits, such as enhanced cleaning, tooth polishing, tooth whitening,<br>
massaging of the gums and/or comfort.<br>
[35] By attaching the cleaning elements into the head at different insertion depths,<br>
a contoured cleaning profile can be achieved without a need for further shaping (e.g.,<br>
trimming and endrounding) of the cleaning elements after being fixed in the head.<br>
Accordingly, an entire process step(s) can be eliminated in the manufacturing process.<br>
Further, this process enables the beneficial use of tapered bristles in a contoured<br>
cleaning profile. Finally, this process can be used in a wide range of manufacturing<br>
processes including, for example, the fixing of bristles into pre-formed holes or the in<br>
situ molding of the bristles into the head.<br>
[36] While only a few toothbrush variations are disclosed herein, the invention<br>
could be used in toothbrushes having many variations in, for example, the head,<br>
handle, and materials used. Alternatively, the toothbrush could be a powered<br>
toothbrush. The head 20 can also be removably secured to the handle 12 whether it is<br>
powered or manual. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are<br>
numerous variations and permutations of the above described systems and techniques.<br>
It is to be understood mat other embodiments may be utilized and structural and<br>
10<br>
