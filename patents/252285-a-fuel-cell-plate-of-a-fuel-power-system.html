				<td>FIELD OF THF INVENTION<br>
 The invention relates to a fuel cell assembly, and more<br>
particularly to a fuel cell assembly utilizing water transport structures<br>
partially disposed in a manifold of the fuel cell stack to facilitate the<br>
transport of liquid water from the fuel cell assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Fuel cell power systems convert a fuel and an oxidant to<br>
electricity. One type of fuel cell power system employs a proton<br>
exchange membrane (hereinafter "PEM") to catalytically facilitate<br>
reaction of fuels (such as hydrogen) and oxidants (such as air or<br>
oxygen) to generate electricity. The PEM is a solid polymer electrolyte<br>
that facilitates transfer of protons from the anode to the cathode in<br>
each individual fuel cell of a stack of fuel cells normally deployed in a<br>
fuel ceil power system.<br>
 In a typical fuel cell stack of a fuel cell power system, individual<br>
fuel cells provide channels through which various reactants and<br>
cooling fluids flow. Fuel cell plates may be unipolar, or a bipolar plate<br>
may be formed by combining a plurality of unipolar plates. Fuel cell<br>
plates may be designed with serpentine flow channels. Serpentine<br>
flow channels are desirable as they effectively distribute reactants<br>
over the active area of an operating fuel cell, thereby maximizing<br>
performance and stability. Movement of water from the flow channels<br>
to outlet manifolds of the fuel cell plates is caused by the flow of the<br>
reactants through the fuel cell. Drag forces cause the liquid water to<br>
flow through the channels until the liquid water exits the fuel cell<br>
through the outlet manifolds. However, when the fuel cell is operating<br>
at a lower power output, the velocity of the gas flow is too low to<br>
produce an effective drag force to transport the liquid water, and the<br>
liquid water accumulates in the flow channels.<br>
 A further limitation of relying on gas flow drag forces to remove<br><br>
the liquid water is that the drag forces may not be strong enough to<br>
effectively transport the liquid water creating pinning points that may<br>
cause the water to accumulate and pool, thereby stopping the water<br>
flow. Such pinning points are those commonly located where the<br>
channel outlets meet the fuel cell stack manifold.<br>
 Some current fuel cell assemblies utilize plates having<br>
hydrophilic surfaces. Water has been observed to form a film on the<br>
surface of the material and accumulate at the outlet of the flow<br>
channels and the perimeter of the plates. The water film can block the<br>
gas flow, which in turn reduces the driving force for removing liquid<br>
water and prevents the removal of the liquid water from the fuel cell<br>
stack. The accumulation of water can cause gas flow blockages or<br>
flow imbalances that can have negative impacts on the performance<br>
of the stack.<br>
 Further, the accumulated water may form ice in the fuel cell<br>
assembly. The presence of water and ice may affect the performance<br>
of the fuel cell assembly. During typical operation of the fuel cell<br>
assembly, waste heat from the fuel cell reaction heats the assembly<br>
and militates against vapor condensation and ice formation in the<br>
assembly. During a starting operation or low power operation of the<br>
fuel cell assembly in subzero temperatures, the condensed water in<br>
the flow channels of the fuel cell plates and at edges of the outlet<br>
manifolds may form ice within the fuel cell assembly. The ice<br>
formation may restrict reactant flow, resulting in a voltage loss.<br>
 It would be desirable to develop a fuel cell assembly with an<br>
improved means for removing liquid water from fuel cell gas flow<br>
channels of the fuel cell stack to minimize the accumulation of liquid<br>
water and ice in the fuel cell assembly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Concordant and congruous with the present invention, a fuel<br>
cell assembly with an improved means for removing liquid water from<br>
fuel cell gas flow channels of the fuel cell assembly to minimize the<br>
accumulation of liquid water and ice in the fuel cell assembly, has<br><br>
surprisingly been discovered.<br>
 In one embodiment, the fuel cell plate comprises a plate having<br>
a first aperture formed therein; a plurality of flow channels formed on<br>
said plate; and a water transport structure disposed between at least<br>
one of said flow channels and the aperture of said plate to facilitate a<br>
transport of water from the at least one of said flow channels to the<br>
aperture.<br>
 In another embodiment, the fuel cell plate comprises a bipolar<br>
plate; a plurality of flow channels formed on each face of said bipolar<br>
plate; at least one aperture formed through said bipolar plate; and a<br>
water transport structure, wherein said water transport structure<br>
includes a first end disposed through an aperture formed in a face of<br>
said bipolar plate between the flow channels and the aperture, an<br>
intermediate portion disposed between the faces of said bipolar plate,<br>
and a second end extending from the intermediate portion into the<br>
aperture.<br>
 In another embodiment, the fuel cell assembly comprises a fuel<br>
cell stack including a plurality of fuel cell plates, each fuel cell plate<br>
having a plurality of flow channels and a plurality of faces, wherein<br>
each fuel cell plate includes at least one aperture formed therein, the<br>
apertures of the fuel cell plates substantially aligned to form a<br>
manifold; and a water transport structure extending into the manifold<br>
from an inner edge of the aperture of each fuel cell plate, wherein<br>
water is caused to flow from the fuel cell plate, through said water<br>
transport structure, and through the manifold.	<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THF PREFERRED EMBODIMFNIT<br>
 The following detailed description and appended drawings describe<br>
and illustrate various exemplary embodiments of the invention. The<br>
description and drawings serve to enable one skilled in the art to make and<br>
use the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in<br>
any manner.<br>
 Figs. 1 and 2 show a fuel cell assembly 10 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The fuel cell assembly includes a plurality of<br>
stacked fuel cell plates 12. Each of the plates 12 includes an inlet aperture,<br>
an outlet aperture, and a plurality of water transport structures 18. The inlet<br>
apertures of each of the plates 12 cooperate to form an inlet manifold 14<br>
and the outlet apertures of each of the plates 12 cooperate to form an outlet<br>
manifold 16. The inlet manifold 14 is in fluid communication with an inlet 28<br>
and the outlet manifold 16 is in fluid communication with an outlet 30. It is<br>
understood that the fuel cell assembly 10 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 may be a<br>
cross-section of either an anode side or a cathode side.<br>
 Figs. 3 and 4 show a top plan view of a bipolar fuel cell plate 12<br>
formed from a pair of unipolar plates. The bipolar plate 12 includes two inlet<br>
apertures 20, two outlet apertures 22, and a plurality of flow channels 24. It<br>
is understood that the flow channels 24 may include the channels disposed<br>
on an external face of the fuel cell plate 12, as well as the passages<br>
disposed intermediate internal faces of the fuel cell plate 12. It is also<br>
understood that the material of construction, size, shape, quantity, and type<br>
of plates 12 in the fuel cell assembly 10, and the configuration of the fuel cell<br>
plates 12 within the assembly 10, may vary based on design parameters<br>
such as the amount of electricity to be generated, the size of the machine to<br>
be powered by the fuel cell assembly 10, the volumetric flow rate of gases<br><br>
through the fuel cell assembly 10, and other similar factors, for example.<br>
The fuel cell plates 12 may be formed from any conventional material such<br>
as graphite, a carbon composite, or a stamped metal, for example. The fuel<br>
cell plate 12 shown in Fig. 3 may be used for an anode side or for a cathode<br>
side (not shown) of the fuel cell assembly 10. Further, it is understood that<br>
the plate 12 may have any number of inlet apertures 20 and outlet apertures<br>
22, as desired. As shown, the flow channels 24 are undulated. However,<br>
the flow channels 24 may be substantially linear, serpentine, or have other<br>
configurations, as desired.<br>
 Water transport structures 18 are disposed on the fuel cell plate 12 at<br>
the inlet apertures 20 and the outlet apertures 22, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
It is understood that more or fewer water transport structures 18 can be<br>
used as desired. The water transport structures 18 include a first end 18a, a<br>
second end 18c, and an intermediate portion 18b formed between the first<br>
end 18a and the second end 18c.<br>
 The first ends 18a of the water transport structures 18 extend into<br>
apertures 26 formed in the fuel cell plate 12 intermediate the flow channels<br>
24 and the inlets 20 and intermediate the flow channels 24 and the outlets<br>
22. Typically, the apertures 26 are formed intermediate a gasket 32 and the<br>
flow channels 24, as shown in Fig. 2, although other configurations can be<br>
used if desired.<br>
 The intermediate portions 18b of the water transport structures 18 are<br>
disposed between the uniploar plates of the fuel cell plate 12. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the intermediate portions 18b of the water transport<br>
structures 18 circumvent the gasket 32. Accordingly, a flow path is provided<br>
adjacent the gasket 32, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
 The second ends 18c of the water transport structures 18 extend<br>
from between the fuel cell plates 12 and into the inlet apertures 20 and<br>
outlet apertures 22. In the embodiment shown, the water transport<br>
structures 18 have a substantially rectangular shape. However, the water<br>
transport structures 18 may have any shape as desired such as a triangular<br>
shape, a curvilinear shape, and an irregular shape, for example. As<br>
illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the second ends 18c of the water transport<br>
structures 18 depend downwardly due to gravity, thereby causing adjacent<br><br>
second ends 18c to substantially abut. However, it is understood that the<br>
second ends 18c can hang individually and in other configurations as<br>
desired.<br>
 The water transport structures 18 may be formed from any non-<br>
conductive porous material such as a foam, cotton, wool, glass fibers, felt,<br>
flocked fibers, paper, and paper and polymer fiber composites, for example.<br>
The water transport structure 18 may also include a hydrophilic coating such<br>
as a silicon oxide (SiOx), another metal oxide, or other chemical coating, for<br>
example, a hydrophobic coating, or be formed from a hydrophilic or<br>
hydrophobic material.<br>
 The inlet manifold 14 includes the inlet 28 in fluid communication with<br>
the inlet manifold 14 formed in the fuel cell assembly 10 by the inlet<br>
apertures 20 of the fuel cell plates 12. The plates 12 are stacked with the<br>
inlet aperture 20 of each plate 12 substantially aligned with the inlet aperture<br>
20 of an adjacent plate or fuel cell plates 12. It is understood that the<br>
diameter, quantity, and length of the inlet manifold 14 will depend on the<br>
size and quantity of inlet apertures 20 in the fuel cell plates 12 and the<br>
 number of fuel cell plates 12 stacked in the fuel cell assembly 10.<br>
 The outlet manifold 16 includes the outlet 30 in fluid communication<br>
with the outlet manifold 16 formed in the fuel cell assembly 10 by the outlet<br>
apertures 22 of the fuel cell plates 12. The plates 12 are stacked with the<br>
outlet aperture 22 of each plate 12 substantially aligned with the outlet<br>
aperture 22 of an adjacent plate or plates 12. It is understood that the<br>
diameter, quantity, and length of the outlet manifold 16 will depend on the<br>
size and quantity of outlet apertures 22 in the plates 12 and the number of<br>
plates 12 stacked together in the fuel cell assembly 10.<br>
 Generally, during operation of a fuel cell power system, a hydrogen<br>
reactant is fed into the anode side of the fuel cell assembly 10. Concurrently,<br>
an oxygen reactant is fed into the cathode side of the fuel cell assembly 10.<br>
On the anode side, the hydrogen is catalytically split into protons and<br>
electrons. The oxidation half-cell reaction is represented by: H2 ↔ 2H+ + 2e-.<br>
In a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, the protons permeate through the<br>
membrane to the cathode side. The electrons travel along an external load<br>
circuit to the cathode side creating the current of electricity of the fuel cell<br><br>
assembly 10. On the cathode side, the oxygen reacts with the protons<br>
permeating through the membrane and the electrons from the external circuit<br>
to form water molecules. This reduction half-cell reaction is represented by:<br>
4H+ + 4e- + O2↔ 2H2O. Anode exhaust from the anode side flows through a<br>
backpressure control valve to a combustor, or is alternatively recycled back to<br>
the anode inlet manifold. Cathode exhaust from the cathode side flows<br>
through a second backpressure control valve to the combustor or to the<br>
ambient environment. A control module typically regulates the conditions of<br>
the hydrogen stream, oxygen stream, and exhaust streams by operating<br>
various control valves, backpressure control valves and compressors in<br>
response to signals from pressure sensors and electrical power sensors<br>
connected to the fuel cell assembly 10.<br>
 During operation of the fuel cell assembly 10, droplets of liquid water<br>
are formed in the channels 24 of the fuel cell plates 12 on the cathode sides<br>
of the fuel cell assembly 10. Some water also may be transported into the<br>
anode flow channels, or may form in the anode channels via condensation<br>
resulting from consumption of the hydrogen. It is understood that the<br>
operation as described herein for the cathode side is similar to operation for<br>
the anode side of the fuel cell assembly 10. The air stream flowing through the<br>
cathode side causes the water droplets to flow through the channels 24,<br>
toward the outlet manifold 16. Water vapor also flows towards the outlet<br>
manifold 16. Once the water droplets contact the first ends 18a of the water<br>
transport structures 18, the water is wicked away from the channels 24 by the<br>
water transport structures 18, through the intermediate portions 18c, and into<br>
the manifolds 14,16 from the second ends 18b. Because the apertures 26<br>
are formed intermediate the gasket 32 and the flow channels 24, the water<br>
and vapor may be removed from the assembly 10 while also facilitating<br>
proper sealing by the gasket 32. If the water transport structures 18 are<br>
spaced apart as shown in Fig. 3, water and water vapor will also be<br>
transported past the water transport structures 18 through the manifolds 14,<br>
16 and from the fuel cell assembly 10 in the known methods of water<br>
removal. If the water transport structures 18 include a hydrophilic coating, or<br>
are produced from a hydrophilic material, this will provide additional capillary<br>
force to attract the water droplets and the condensed water vapor. The<br><br>
exhaust gas streams also pass through the water transport structures 18, and<br>
through the outlet manifold 16. If the water transport structures 18 include a<br>
hydrophobic coating or are produced from a hydrophobic material, capillary<br>
action is aided by the repulsive nature of the coating or material.<br>
 It is expected that three different water transport mechanisms may be<br>
utilized to remove the water from the channels 24, depending on the material<br>
used for the water transport structures 18. First, the porous materials 18 may<br>
form a network of open, continuous pores that are capable of utilizing capillary<br>
forces to transport the water therethrough. Second, because the second ends<br>
18c of the water transport structures 18 abut and form continuous paths<br>
through the inlet manifold 14 and the outlet manifold 16 of the fuel cell<br>
assembly 10, the water absorbed by the water transport structures 18 will<br>
create a static pressure head to facilitate removal of the water from the<br>
manifolds 14,16. It is desirable, though not necessary, for a portion of the<br>
water transport structures 18 to be saturated to create a sufficient head to<br>
cause the water to drain from the water transport structures 18. If a saturated<br>
portion is not created in the water transport structures 18, a peristaltic pump<br>
(not shown) may be used with the fuel cell assembly 10 to cause the water to<br>
flow through the assembly 10 and out of the water transport structures 18.<br>
The peristaltic pump may be a peristaltic pump such as the one disclosed by<br>
Anonymous, Pump to Remove Water from a Wick, Pub. No. 494084, O.G.<br>
June 2005. Third, during operation of the fuel cell assembly 10, it is<br>
anticipated that a portion of an operational cycle will result in the outlet<br>
reactants streams being less than saturated, wherein evaporation will aid<br>
water removal from the water transport structures 18.<br>
 From the foregoing description, one ordinarily skilled in the art can<br>
easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention and, without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and<br>
modifications to the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.<br><br>
