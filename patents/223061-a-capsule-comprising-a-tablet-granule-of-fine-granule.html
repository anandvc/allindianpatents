				<td>CONTROLLED RELEASE PREPARATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a controlled release<br>
preparation, in particular a capsule comprising a tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule wherein the release of active<br>
ingredient is controlled and a gel-forming polymer which<br>
delays the migration speed in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Background Art<br>
 An oral formulation is a dosage form which is used<br>
most frequently among pharmaceutical agents. Lots of<br>
preparations for oral administration wherein the drug<br>
efficacy thereof is sustained with the administration of<br>
once or twice a day have been developed from the viewpoint<br>
of improving QOL in these years. The compound having a<br>
kinetics of sustained drug efficacy with the administration<br>
of once or twice a day is tried to synthesize in the<br>
synthetic stage of compound itself, while quite a lot of<br>
attempts to modify the kinetics are made with designing<br>
controlled release preparation by contriving formulation.<br>
As the dosage form of oral controlled release preparation,<br>
various release-controlled systems such as a release<br>
control by a release-controlled coating-layer or a<br><br>
diffusion control of compound by a matrix, a release<br>
control of compound by erosion of matrix (base material), a<br>
pH-dependent release control of compound and a time-<br>
dependent release control wherein the compound is released<br>
after a certain lag time, are developed and applied. It is<br>
considered that a further extension of sustainability<br>
becomes possible by combining the above-mentioned release-<br>
controlled system with a control of migration speed in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract.<br>
 The preparation containing a medicament having an<br>
acid-labile property as an active ingredient such as a<br>
benzimidazole compound having a proton pump inhibitor<br>
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as PPI) action needs to<br>
be enteric-coated. That is, a composition containing a<br>
benzimidazole compound having a proton pump inhibitor<br>
action is needed to disintegrate rapidly in the small<br>
intestine, so the composition is preferred to formulate<br>
into a granule or fine granule which has a broader surface<br>
area than a tablet and is easy to disintegrate or dissolve<br>
rapidly. In the case of a tablet, it is desirable to reduce<br>
the size of tablet (for example, see JP-A 62-277322).<br>
 After administered orally, the tablet, granule or fine<br>
granule migrates through gastrointestinal tract with<br>
releasing an active ingredient to stomach, duodenum,<br>
jejunum, ileum and colon sequentially. And in the meantime,<br><br>
the active ingredient is absorbed at the each absorption<br>
site. A controlled release preparation is designed to<br>
control the absorption by delaying the release of active<br>
ingredient in some way. It is considered that a further<br>
extension of sustainability becomes possible by combining a<br>
release-controlled system with a function to control the<br>
migration speed in gastrointestinal tract such as<br>
adherability, floatability etc. These prior arts are<br>
disclosed in WO 01/89483, JP-A 2001-526213, USP 6,274,173,<br>
USP 6,093,734, USP 4,045,563, USP 4,686,230, USP 4,873,337,<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
(Object of the Invention)<br>
 An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
controlled release preparation wherein the release of<br>
active ingredient of drug is controlled, which releases an<br>
active ingredient for an extended period of time with<br>
staying or slowly migrating in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>

(Detailed Description of the Invention)<br>
 The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing a tablet, granule or fine granule<br>
wherein the release of active ingredients is controlled, or<br>
a pharmaceutical composition containing these tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule and a gel-forming polymer which<br>
delays digestive tract migration speed. The pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention may be these tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule itself, or a form of a mixture of a<br>
tablet, granule or fine granule and a gel-forming polymer,<br>
or a capsule filled in capsule, but a capsule is preferred<br>
in particular. It has been cleared that the persistence of<br><br>
blood levels after oral administration is remarkably<br>
prolonged by these combinations.<br>
 The release control of active ingredient in "a tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule wherein the release of active<br>
ingredient is controlled" of the present invention is<br>
performed by coating the active ingredient in a tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule with a layer controlling the<br>
release of active ingredient, or by dispersing the active<br>
ingredient in release-controlled matrices. Further, the<br>
"tablet, granule or fine granule wherein the release of<br>
active ingredient is controlled" of the present invention<br>
include also a tablet, granule or fine granule which is<br>
coated with a usual enteric coat which is dissolved at a pH<br>
of about 5.5, and tablets containing these granules or fine<br>
granules.<br>
 On the other hand, when the "release-controlled<br>
coating-layer" is mentioned in the present specification,<br>
it indicates a coating-layer having a function of further<br>
delaying or extending the release of active ingredient,<br>
such as a pH-dependently soluble layer which is dissolved<br>
at a higher pH region than a usual enteric coating which is<br>
dissolved at a pH of about 5.5, and a diffusion-controlled<br>
layer whose layer itself is not dissolved and which<br>
releases an active ingredient through pores which are<br>
formed in the layer. It does not include a usual enteric<br><br>
coat and layer which is dissolved at a pH of about 5.5,<br>
rapidly dissolved in the intestinal juice and release an<br>
active ingredient. Further, the pH mentioned here means a<br>
pH of the Mcilvaine solution or Clark-Lubs solution.<br>
Hereinafter, the pH of a pH-dependently soluble layer means<br>
the pH of these solutions.<br>
 The coating-layer of the "release-controlled coating-<br>
layer" inlcudes coating layers in a film form and those<br>
having larger thickness. Also, the coating-layer includes<br>
not only a coating-layer which entirely coats the inner<br>
core or layer but also the coating layers in which a part<br>
of the inner core or layer is not covered but most of the<br>
inner core or layer is coated (coating-layer which covers<br>
at least about 80% or more of the surface of the inner core<br>
or layer, and preferably covers the surface entirely).<br>
 The absorption from the digestive tract of the active<br>
ingredient from the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
present invention is controlled by two kind of systems<br>
utilizing (1) a release control of active ingredient by a<br>
controlled release tablet, granule or fine granule and (2)<br>
retentive prolongation in the digestive tract of a tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule by a gel-forming polymer, or their<br>
combinations. Among the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
present invention, the composition containing a gel-forming<br>
polymer forms adhesive gels by rapidly absorbing water by<br><br>
the gel-forming polymer in the digestive tract when orally<br>
administrated, and the tablet, granule or fine granule is<br>
retained on the surface of gels or in the gels to be<br>
gradually migrated through the digestive tract. The release<br>
of active ingredient is controlled in the meanwhile, the<br>
active ingredient is released continuously or in a<br>
pulsatile manner from the tablet, granule or fine granule<br>
by a controlled system, and as a result, the incidences of<br>
prolonged absorption and drug efficacy are attained.<br>
 The above-mentioned system enabling the persistence of<br>
therapeutic effective levels by controlling the release<br>
over a long time has advantages of therapeutic<br>
effectiveness at a low dose and reduction of side effects<br>
caused by initial rise of blood level and the like, as well<br>
as the reduction of administration times.<br>
 The gel-forming polymer may be a polymer which rapidly<br>

gel-forming polymer is preferably a polymer having a<br>
viscosity of about 3000 mPa.s or more for 5% aqueous<br>
solution at 25°C. Further, the gel-forming polymer is<br>
preferably a polymer usually having a molecular weight of<br>
about 400000 to 10000000 in general. As the gel-forming<br>
polymer, powder, granular or fine granular polymer is<br>
preferable for producing formulations. The gel-forming<br><br>
polymer includes a polyethylene oxide (PEO, for example,<br>
Polyox WSR 303 (molecular weight: 7000000), Polyox WSR<br>
Coagulant (molecular weight: 5000000), Polyox WSR 301<br>
(molecular weight: 4000000), Polyox WSR N-60K (molecular<br>
weight: 2000000), and Polyox WSR 205 (molecular weight:<br>
600000); manufactured by Dow Chemical Co., Ltd.),<br>

 One preferable form of a tablet, granule or fine<br>
granule wherein the release of active ingredient is<br>
controlled includes a tablet, granule or fine granule<br>
wherein a core particle containing at least one active<br>
ingredient is coated with a release-controlled coating-<br><br>
layer and a tablet containing these granules or fine<br>
granules. In order to prepare such core-possessing tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule, as a core particle can be used the<br>
tablet, granule or fine granule wherein an active<br>
ingredient is coated on a core which is an inactive carrier<br>
such as NONPAREIL (NONPAREIL-101 (particle diameter: 850-<br>
710, 710-500, and 500-355), NONPAREIL-103 (particle<br>
diameter: 850-710, 710-500, and 500-355), NONPAREIL-105<br>
(particle diameter: 710-500, 500-355 and 300-180);<br>
manufactured by Freund Industrial Co., Ltd.) and Celphere<br>
(CP-507 (particle diameter: 500-710), and CP-305 (particle<br>
diameter: 300-500); manufactured by Asahi Kasei<br>
Corporation); or the tablet prepared by using these<br>
granules or fine granules; or the particle obtained by<br>
granulation using an active ingredient and an excipient<br>
usually used for formulation. For example, they can be<br>
produced by the method disclosed in JP-A 63-301816. For<br>
example, when a core particle is prepared by coating an<br>
active ingredient on a core of an inactive carrier, core<br>
particles containing an active ingredient can be produced<br>
by wet granulation, using, for example, a centrifugal<br>
fluid-bed granulator (CF-mini, CF-360, manufactured by<br>
Freund Industrial Co., Ltd.) or a centrifugal fluidized<br>
coating granulator (POWREX MP-10), or the like. Further,<br>
coating may be carried out by dusting an active ingredient<br><br>
while adding a solution containing a binder and the like on<br>
the core of an inactive carrier with spray and the like.<br>
The production apparatuses are not limited and for example,<br>
it is preferable in the latter coating to produce them<br>
using a centrifugal fluid-bed granulator and the like. An<br>
active ingredient may be coated at two steps by carrying<br>
out the coating using the above-mentioned two apparatuses<br>
in combination. When an inactive carrier core is not used,<br>
a core particle can be produced by granulating excipient<br>
such as lactose, white sugar, mannitol, corn starch and<br>
crystalline cellulose and an active ingredient, using<br>
binders such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, a polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, Macrogol, Pullronic F68, gum arabic, gelatin and<br>
starch, if necessary, adding disintegrants such as sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
sodium cross carboxymethyl cellulose (Ac-Di-Sol,<br>
manufactured by FMC International Co., Ltd.), polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone and low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
with a stirring granulator, a wet extruding granulator, a<br>
fluidized bed granulator and the like.<br>
 Particles having desired sizes can be obtained by<br>
sieving the granules or fine granules obtained. The core<br>
particle may be prepared by dry granulation with a roller<br>
compactor and the like. Particles having a particle size<br><br>
of 50 µm to 5 mm, preferably 100 µm to 3 mm and more<br>
preferably 100 µm to 2 mm are used.<br>
 The active ingredient-containing core particle thus<br>
obtained may be further coated to provide an intermediate<br>
coating layer, and the particle may be used as a core<br>
particle. It is preferable from the viewpoint of improving<br>
the stability of drugs that the intermediate coating layer<br>
is provided to intercept the direct contact of active<br>
ingredient-containing core particle with the release-<br>
controlled coating-layer when the active ingredient is an<br>
unstable drug against an acid, such as PPI and the like,<br>
etc. The intermediate coating layer may be formed by a<br>
plural number of layers.<br>
 The coating materials for the intermediate coating<br>
layer include those obtained by appropriately compounding<br>
polymeric materials such as low substituted hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose (for example, TC-5 and the like),<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose<br>
and hydroxyethyl methylcellulose with saccharides such as<br>
sucrose [purified sucrose (pulverized (powdered sugar), not<br>
pulverized) and the like], starch saccharide such as corn<br>
starch, lactose, sugar alcohol (D-mannitol, erythritol and<br>
the like). Excipients (for example, masking agents<br>
(titanium oxide and the like) and antistatic agents<br><br>
(titanium oxide, talc and the like) may be suitably added<br>
to the intermediate coating layer for the preparations<br>
mentioned below, if necessary.<br>
 The coating amount of the intermediate coating layer<br>
is usually about 0.02 part by weight to about 1.5 parts by<br>
weight based on 1 part by weight of granules containing an<br>
active ingredient, and preferably about 0.05 part by weight<br>
to about 1 part by weight. The coating can be carried out<br>
by conventional methods. For example, preferably, the<br>
components of the intermediate coating layer are diluted<br>
with purified water and sprayed to coat in liquid form.<br>
Then, it is preferable to carry out the coating while<br>
spraying a binder such as hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
 As the controlled release tablet, granule or fine<br>
granule contained in the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable to coat the above-<br>
mentioned core particle with a coating material which is<br>
pH-dependently dissolved/eluted to control the release, and<br>
to prepare the tablet, granule or fine granule having a<br>
release-controlled coating-layer, or the tablet containing<br>
these controlled release granules or fine granules. Herein,<br>
the "pH-dependently" means that the coating material is<br>
dissolved/eluted under the circumstances of more than a<br>
certain pH value to release an active ingredient. A usual<br>
enteric coat is eluted at a pH of about 5.5 to initiate the<br><br>
release of drug, while the coating material of the present<br>
invention is preferably a substance which is dissolved at a<br>
higher pH (preferably a pH of 6.0 or above and 7.5 or below,<br>
and more preferably a pH of 6.5 or above and below 7.2) and<br>
controls more favorably the release of drug in the stomach.<br>

alone or at least 2 or more kinds of the polymers may be<br>
used to coat in combination, or at least 2 or more kinds of<br>
the polymers may be coated sequentially to prepare multi-<br>
layers. It is desirable that the coating material is used<br>
alone or, if necessary, in combination so that the polymer<br>
is dissolved preferably at a pH of 6.0 or above, more<br>
preferably at a pH of 6.5 or above, and further more<br>
preferably at a pH of 6.75 or above. Further, more<br>

(Method A)<br>
 The compound (II) or a salt thereof can be obtained by<br>
condensation of compound (IV) or a salt thereof with<br>
compound (V) or a salt thereof in the presence or absence<br>
of a base. The salt of compound (IV) and the salt of<br><br>
compound (V) here are exemplified by the above-mentioned<br>

methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and the like), and the<br>
like can be mentioned.<br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined above. The reaction of<br>
Method A is generally conducted in a solvent, and a solvent<br>
that does not inhibit the reaction of Method A is selected<br>
as appropriate. Examples of such solvent include ethers<br>
(e.g., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, tert-butyl<br>
methyl ether, diisopropyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether and the like), esters (e.g., ethyl formate, ethyl<br>

to 100-fold amount by weight, preferably 5- to 50-fold<br>
amount by weight, relative to 1 mole of compound (IV) or a<br>
salt thereof.<br>
 The amount of compound (IV) or a salt thereof to be<br>
used is generally 1-10 mole, preferably 1-3 mole,<br>
relative to 1 mole of compound (IV) or a salt thereof.<br>
The reaction of Method A is carried out within a<br>
temperature range of from about 0°C to 100°C, preferably<br>
20°C to 80°C.<br>
 The reaction time of Method A varies depending on the<br>
kind of compounds (IV), (V) or a salt thereof and solvent,<br>
reaction temperature and the like, but it is generally 1<br>
min. - 96 hrs., preferably 1 min. - 72 hrs., more<br>
preferably 15 min. - 24 hrs.<br>
 The base in Method A is, for example, an inorganic<br>

(V) or a salt thereof.<br>
 The compound (IV) or a salt thereof can be produced<br>
according to the method described in JP-A-61-50978, USP<br>
4,628,098 and the like or a method similar thereto.<br>
 The compound (V) or a salt thereof can be produced<br>
according to a method known per se or a method analogous<br>
thereto. For example, when X is a chlorine atom, compound<br>
(V) can be obtained by reacting a compound represented by<br>
the formula (VII):<br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined above, or a salt thereof<br>
with phosgene, trichloromethyl chloroformate,<br>
bis(trichloromethyl)carbonate, thiophosgene and the like in<br>
the presence of an acid scavenger in a solvent (e.g.,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dichloromethane etc.).<br><br>
Alternatively, compound (V) can be also obtained by<br>
treating ethylcarbamate, which is obtained by reacting<br>
compound (VII) or a salt thereof with ethyl chloroformate,<br>
with phosphorus oxychloride according to the method<br>
described in Synthetic Communications, vol. 17, p. 1887<br>

compound (VII), for example, acid addition salts such as<br>
inorganic acid salts (e.g., hydrochloride, sulfate,<br>
hydrobromide, phosphate etc.), organic acid salts (e.g.,<br>
acetate, trifluoroacetate, succinate, maleate, fumarate,<br>
propionate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, oxalate,<br>

y-collidine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpiperidine, N-<br>
methylpyrrolidine, N-methylmorpholine, 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine etc.) and the like can be mentioned.<br>
The compound (VII) and a salt thereof can be produced<br>
according to a method known per se or a method analogous<br>
thereto. For example, when D1 is other than a bond,<br>
compound (VII) can be obtained by condensing a compound<br><br>
represented by the formula (VIII):<br><br>
wherein R4 is a hydrogen atom or nitrogen-protecting group,<br>
and other symbols are as defined above, or a salt thereof<br>
with carboxylic acid or thionic acid represented by the<br>
formula (IX):<br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined above, or a reactive<br>
derivative thereof (e.g., anhydride, halide etc.), or a<br>

like can be mentioned.<br>
 Alternatively, when D1 is a bond, compound (VII) can<br>
be obtained by condensing carboxylic acid or thionic acid<br>
represented by the formula (X):<br><br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined above, or a reactive<br>
derivative thereof (e.g., anhydride, halide etc.), or a<br>
salt thereof with a compound represented by G-D2-H in a<br>
suitable solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide etc.), followed by<br>
deprotection, as necessary. As the salt of compound (X),<br>
for example, acid addition salts such as inorganic acid<br>

These groups may be substituted by 1 to 3 halogen atoms<br>
(e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine etc.), a nitro group and<br>
the like.<br>
 As a method for removing such protecting groups, a<br>
method known per se or a method analogous thereto is used,<br>
which is, for example, a method using an acid, a base,<br>
reduction, UV light, palladium acetate etc., and the like<br>
are used.<br>
(Method B)<br>
 The compound (II) and a salt thereof can be obtained<br>
by subjecting compound (VI) or a salt thereof to<br>
oxidization reaction.<br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined above.<br>

oxidant such as nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacid,<br>
peroxyacid ester, ozone, dinitrogen tetraoxide,<br><br>
iodosobenzene, N-halosuccinimide, 1-chlorobenzotriazole,<br>
tert-butyl hypochlorite, diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-bromine<br>
complex, sodium metaperiodate, selenium dioxide, manganese<br>
dioxide, chromic acid, cerium ammonium nitrate, bromine,<br>
chlorine, sulfuryl chloride, magnesium, monoperoxyphthalate<br>
and the like. The amount of the oxidant to be used is<br>
generally 0.5 mole - 2 mole, preferably 0.8 mole - 1.2 mole,<br>
per 1 mole of compound (VI) or a salt thereof. The<br>
oxidization may be carried out using the above-mentioned<br>
oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacids in the<br>
presence of a catalyst such as vanadium acetate, vanadium<br>
oxide acetylacetonate, titanium tetraisopropoxide and the<br>
like.<br>
 The reaction of Method B is generally carried out in a<br>
solvent inert to the above-mentioned oxidation reaction.<br>
Examples of the "inert solvent" include water, alcohols<br>
(e.g., methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol etc.),<br>
ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone etc.), nitriles<br>
(e.g., acetonitrile, propionitrile etc.), amides (e.g.,<br>
formamide, N,N-dimethylformamide etc.), ethers (e.g.,<br>
diethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, diisopropyl ether,<br>
dioxane, tetrahydrofuran etc.), sulfoxides (e.g., dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide etc.) and polar solvents (e.g., sulfolane,<br>
hexamethylphosphoramide etc.), which may be used alone or<br>
as a mixed solvent thereof. The "inert solvent" is used in<br><br>
generally 1- to 100-fold amount by weight of compound (VI)<br>
or a salt thereof.<br>
 The reaction temperature is generally from -80°C to<br>
80°C, preferably from 0°C to 30°C.<br>
 The reaction time is generally 1 min. - 6 hrs.,<br>
preferably 15 mins. - 1 hr.<br>
 The compound (VI), which is a starting material in<br>
Method B, can be obtained by a reaction similar to that in<br>
Method A, by the use of, for example, a compound<br>
represented by the following formula (XI):<br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined above, instead of<br>
compound (IV).<br>
 The compound (XI) can be synthesized according to the<br>
methods described in the following references or a method<br>
analogous thereto: JP-A-61-50978, JP-A-54-141783, JP-A-61-<br>
22079, JP-A-1-6270, JP-A-63-146882.<br>
 The salt of compound (VI) is exemplified by the above-<br>
mentioned salts of the compound (II), which are acid<br>
addition salts such as inorganic acid salt (e.g.,<br>
hydrochloride, sulfate, hydrobromide, phosphate and the<br>
like), organic acid salt (e.g., acetate, trifluoroacetate,<br>
succinate, maleate, fumarate, propionate, citrate, tartrate,<br><br>
lactate, oxalate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and<br>
the like) and the like.<br>
 The compound (II) or a salt thereof obtained by the<br>
above-mentioned methods A or B can be isolated and purified<br>
from the reaction mixture by a separation means known per<br>
se (e.g., concentration, concentration under reduced<br>
pressure, solvent extraction, crystallization,<br>
recrystallization, phase transfer, chromatography and the<br>
like). Since compound (II) and a salt thereof obtained by<br>
the above-mentioned methods A or B encompass any isomers<br>
thereof, optically pure compound (II) and a salt thereof<br>
can be obtained by, for example, subjecting compound (II)<br>
or a salt thereof to optical resolution, or asymmetric<br>
oxidation of compound (VI) or a salt thereof.<br>
 The method of optical resolution includes methods<br>
known per se, such as a fractional recrystallization method,<br>
a chiral column method, a diastereomer method, and so forth.<br>
Asymmetric oxidation includes methods known per se, such as<br>
the method described in WO96/02535 and the like.<br>
 The "fractional recrystallization method" includes a<br>
method in which a salt is formed between a racemate and an<br>
optically active compound [e.g., (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-<br>
mandelic acid, (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-tartaric acid, (+)-1-<br>
phenethylamine, (-)-1-phenethylamine, cinchonine, (-)-<br>
cinchonidine, brucine, etc.], which salt is separated by<br><br>
fractional recrystallization etc., and, if desired,<br>
subjected to a neutralization process to give a free<br>
optical isomer.<br>
 The "chiral column method" includes a method in which<br>
a racemate or a salt thereof is applied to a column for<br>
optical isomer separation (chiral column). In the case of<br>
liquid chromatography, for example, optical isomers are<br>
separated by adding a racemate to a chiral column such as<br>
ENANTIO-OVM (produced by Tosoh Corporation), the DAICEL<br>
CHIRAL series (produced by Daicel Corporation) and the like,<br>
and developing the racemate in water, a buffer (e.g.,<br>
phosphate buffer), an organic solvent (e.g., hexane,<br>
ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile,<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, diethylamine, triethylamine, etc.),<br>
or a solvent mixture thereof. In the case of gas<br>
chromatography, for example, a chiral column such as CP-<br>
Chirasil-DeX CB (produced by GL Science) and the like is<br>
used to separate optical isomers.<br>
 The "diastereomer method" includes a method in which a<br>
racemate and an optically active reagent are reacted to<br>
give a diastereomeric mixture, which is then subjected to<br>
ordinary separation means (e.g., fractional<br>
recrystallization, chromatography, etc.) to obtain either<br>
diastereomer, which is subjected to a chemical reaction<br>
(e.g., acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis,<br><br>
etc.) to cut off the optically active reagent moiety,<br>
whereby the desired optical isomer is obtained. Said<br>
"optically active reagent" includes, for example, optically<br>
active organic acids such as MTPA [a-methoxy-?-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid], (-)-menthoxyacetic<br>
acid and the like, optically active alkoxymethyl halides<br>
such as (1R-endo)-2-(chloromethoxy)-1,3,3-<br>
trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane etc., and the like.<br>
 Further, a benzimidazole compound represented by the<br>
following general formula (III) or a salt thereof is also<br>
mentioned as the specific example of the above-mentioned<br>
prodrug.<br><br>
 In the above-mentioned formula (III), D indicates an<br>
oxygen atom or a bond, and Q indicates a hydrocarbon group<br>
optionally having a substituent group.<br>
 The "hydrocarbon group" of the "hydrocarbon group<br>
optionally having a substituent group" represented by Q<br>
includes an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group, and an<br><br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon group mentioned here means a<br>

per se, and are produced by the methods disclosed in, for<br>
example, JP-A 2002-187890, WO 02/30920 and the like, or<br>

compound disclosed in WO 03/27098.<br>
 Although the compounding amounts of the active<br>
ingredient represented by the general formulae (I'), (I),<br>
(II) and (III) used in the present invention differ<br><br>
depending on the kinds and doses of the active ingredient,<br>
the amounts are, for example, about 1% by weight to about<br>
60% by weight based on the total amount of tablets or<br>
granules of the present invention, preferably about 1% by<br>
weight to about 50% by weight and further preferably about<br>
8% by weight to about 40% by weight. When the active<br>
ingredient is a benzimidazole compound PPI, in particular<br>
lansoprazole, the amount is about 8% by weight to about 40%<br>
by weight.<br>
 In case of capsules containing the imidazole PPI,<br>
especially benzimidazole PPI represented by the general<br>
formula (I') or (I) such as lansoprazole or an optically<br>
active compound thereof (R-isomer and the like) and the<br>
imidazole derivative PPI represented by the formula (II)<br>
and (III), 2 kinds or more of a tablet, granule or fine<br>
granule having different behavior of release (for example,<br>
2 kinds of granules such as granules wherein the active<br>
ingredient is released comparatively quickly and granules<br>
wherein the active ingredient is released with prolonged<br>
time) may be filled in combination, using release-<br>
controlled coating-layers which have different release<br>
properties and conditions respectively. Further, 2 kinds of<br>
these release-controlled coating-layers may be stacked in 2<br>
or more layers in the respective granules or fine granules.<br>
The preparation which enhances blood levels at a more<br><br>
earlier stage after administration to reveal drug efficacy<br>
and then sustain the drug efficacy by the expression of the<br>
drug efficacy of the release-controlled granule can be<br>
provided, by preparing a preparation (preferably a capsule)<br>
which contains a granule having an intermediate layer on<br>
the core particle containing the above-mentioned active<br>
ingredient and only one layer of enteric coat on said<br>
intermediate layer (accordingly, among the above-mentioned<br>
release-controlled granule or fine granule by the present<br>
invention, the granule in which the release of active<br>
ingredient is comparatively rapid.), in addition to a<br>
tablet, granule or fine granule having the release-<br>
controlled coating-layers of the present invention and the<br>
digestive tract retentive gel-forming polymer; or by<br>
administering capsules containing a tablet, granule or fine<br>
granule having the release control layer of the present<br>
invention and the digestive tract retentive gel-forming<br>
polymer, together with a preparation containing only<br>
granules having a usual enteric coat. Further, when the<br>
tablet (in this case, small size tablet is preferable),<br>
granule or fine granule to be filled has an enough release-<br>
controlling function, the capsules of the present invention<br>
may not always contain the gel-forming polymer. Capsules<br>
may be prepared using only the release-controlled tablet,<br>
granule or fine granule, or by combining the release-<br><br>
controlled tablet, granule or fine granule with a fast-<br>
releasing type granule having only enteric coat. In case of<br>
such combined preparations and combined administration,<br>
there can be prepared the preparations by which the blood<br>
level is preferably enhanced at a more earlier stage to<br>
achieve drug efficacy and to reach the first maximal blood<br>
level, and then the second maximal blood level is reached<br>
by the release of active ingredient from granules in which<br>
the release was controlled, that is, two peaks are<br>
expressed. Further, the controlled release preparation such<br>
as the above-mentioned controlled release capsule of the<br>
present invention and a usual capsule wherein the active<br>
ingredient is comparatively released quickly may be<br>
administered at the same time or at an interval. A high<br>
blood level of active ingredient can be maintained over a<br>
long time by such combined administration.<br>
 Usual enteric-coated Granules can be produced, for<br>
example, according to the method described in JP-A 63-<br>
301826. Further, it is preferable to prepare a stabilized<br>
preparation according to the method described in JP-A 62-<br>
277322.<br>
 Further, the granule which contains lansoprazole or<br>
optically active form thereof and the like at a higher<br>
concentration and is sufficiently stabilized can be<br>
produced as follow. Namely, there are produced the granules<br><br>
having an active ingredient layer, an intermediate layer<br>
formed on said active ingredient layer and an enteric<br>
coated layer formed on said intermediate layer, wherein<br>
said active ingredient layer contains about 10% by weight<br>
to about 40% by weight of lansoprazole and the like based<br>
on the total amount of the granule and a basic inorganic<br>
salt as a stabilizer and average particle diameter is about<br>
600 µm to about 2500 µm, using known granulation methods<br>
such as a fluid-bed granulation method (for example, a<br>
centrifugal fluid-bed granulation method), a fluidized<br>
granulation method and a stirring granulation method (for<br>
example, a fluid-bed fluidized granulation method).<br>
 Specifically, the active ingredient layer can be<br>
obtained, for example, by coating a core particle with a<br>
dusting powder containing the imidazole PPI, a basic metal<br>
salt, an excipient, a disintegrant and the like while<br>
spraying a binding solution such as hydroxypropylcellulose<br>
and the like on the core particle. As said core particle,<br>
for example, Nonpareil prepared by coating sucrose (75<br>
parts by weight) with corn starch (25 parts by weight) by a<br>
known method per se, a spherical core granule using<br>
crystalline cellulose and the like are exemplified.<br>
Further, a core granule itself may be the above-mentioned<br>
active ingredient of drug. The average particle size of<br>
said granules is 14 to 80 mesh in general.<br><br>
 As the core, a spherically granulated product of<br>
sucrose and starch, a spherically granulated product of<br>
crystalline cellulose, a spherically granulated product of<br>
crystalline cellulose and lactose and the like are<br>
exemplified.<br>
 The ratio of coating layer relative to the core can be<br>
selected within a range of being able to control the<br>
elution property of active ingredient and the particle size<br>
of granules. For example, it is usually about 0.2 part by<br>
weight to about 5 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight<br>
of core, and preferably about 0.1 part by weight to about 5<br>
parts by weight.<br>
 Then, the intermediate layer is formed on the active<br>
ingredient layer obtained by a conventional method. For<br>
example, the component of the intermediate layer is diluted<br>
with purified water and the like, and the mixture is<br>
sprayed in liquid form to coat the active ingredient layer.<br>
At this time, it is preferable to coat the layer while<br>
spraying a binding agent such as hydroxypropylcellulose.<br>
Examples of the intermediate layer include, for example, a<br>
layer in which sugars such as sucrose (purified white sugar<br>
(those pulverized (powder sugar) and those not pulverized)<br>
and the like), starch sugar such as corn starch, lactose,<br>
honey and sugar alcohol (D-mannitol, erythritol and the<br>
like) are appropriately compounded with polymeric base<br><br>
materials such as low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (for<br>
example, TC-5 and the like), polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose and hydroxyethyl<br>
methylcellulose. Excipients (for example, masking agent<br>
(titanium oxide and the like)) and antistatic agents<br>
(titanium oxide, talc and the like) which are added to<br>
prepare a preparation may be further appropriately added in<br>
the intermediate coating layer, if necessary.<br>
 The coat amount of the intermediate coating layer is<br>
usually, for example, about 0.02 part by weight to about<br>
1.5 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight of granules<br>
containing the benzimidazole PPI, and preferably about 0.05<br>
part by weight to about 1 part by weight.<br>
 Further, the granules which contain lansoprazole and<br>
the like at a high concentration and are sufficiently<br>
stabilized can be produced by forming a enteric coated<br>
layer on the intermediate coating layer by a conventional<br>
method. As the component of the enteric coated layer, for<br>
example, sustained release base materials such as aqueous<br>
enteric polymer base materials such as cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate (CAP), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose acetate succinate, ethyl acrylate-<br>
methyl methacrylate-trimethylammoniumethyl methacrylate<br>
chloride copolymer (Eudragit RS or RL; manufactured by Rohm<br><br>
Co.)/ methyl methacrylate-ethyl acrylate copolymer<br>
(Eudragit NE30D; manufactured by Rohm Co.), carboxymethyl<br>
ethylcellulose and shellac; plasticizers such as water-<br>
soluble polymer, triethyl citrate, polyethylene glycol<br>
(polyethylene glycol 6000 (trade name: Macrogol 6000, and<br>
the like), acetylated monoglyceride, triacetin and castor<br>
oil are used. These may be used alone or by mixing 2 kinds<br>
or more.<br>
 The coat amount of the enteric coated layer is about<br>
10% by weight to about 70% by weight based on the total<br>
amount of granules before enteric coating, preferably about<br>
10% by weight to about 50% by weight and more preferably<br>
about 15% by weight to about 30% by weight.<br>
 In case of a tablet, for example, the benzimidazole<br>
compound, an excipient, a binding agent, a disintegrant, a<br>
lubricant and the like are mixed to directly produce tables<br>
by compression, or the granules which is produced in same<br>
manner as the above-mentioned granules can be compressed<br>
into tablet. Further, alternatively, 2 layered tablets may<br>
be prepared with a commercially available multilayer tablet<br>
machine using the granulated granules.<br>
 Among the preparations of the present invention,<br>
preparations containing the PPI of benzimidazole compound<br>
represented by the general formula (I') such as<br>
lansoprazole and optically active form thereof, above all<br><br>
benzimidazole PPI compound represented by the general<br>
formula (I), and the PPI of a prodrug-type imidazole<br>
compound derivative (in particular, a compound represented<br>
by the above-mentioned general formula (II) and (III) and<br>
an optically active compound thereof) have superior anti-<br>
ulcer effect, gastric juice secretion suppressing effect,<br>
mucosa protective effect, anti-Helicobacter pylori effect<br>
and the like in vivo, and are useful as a medicine because<br>
of low toxicity. In particular, since the imidazole<br>
compound represented by the above-mentioned general formula<br>
(II) is stable to an acid, it is unnecessary to prepare an<br>
enteric preparation for oral administration, the cost of<br>
preparing enteric preparations is reduced, and the patients<br>
with weak deglutition, in particular, aged people and<br>
children are easily dosed because the size of the<br>
preparations becomes small. Further, since the absorption<br>
is faster than enteric preparations, gastric juice<br>
secretion suppressing effect is rapidly expressed, and<br>
since it is gradually converted to its original compound in<br>
vivo, it has a sustainability and is useful as anti-ulcer<br>
agents and the like. The PPI compound of compound (I') of<br>
the present invention or a salt thereof is less toxic, and<br>
can be orally or parenterally (for example, local, rectal,<br>
vein administration) and safely administered as it is or as<br>
a pharmaceutical composition by mixing with a<br><br>
pharmacologically acceptable carrier according to a known<br>
method per se, that is, for example, as a preparation such<br>
as a tablet (including sugar coated tablet and film coated<br>
tablet) , powder, granule, capsule (including soft capsule),<br>
intraoral disintegrating tablet, liquid, injection,<br>
suppository, sustained-release agent and liniment.<br>
 The tablet, granule or fine granule of the present<br>
invention can be orally administrated to mammals (for<br>
example, human, monkey, sheep, horse, dog, cat, rabbit,<br>
mouse and the like) for the treatment and prevention of<br>
digestive ulcer (for example, gastric ulcer, duodenum ulcer,<br>
marginal ulcer and the like), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,<br>
gastritis, reflux esophagitis, Symptomatic Gastroesophageal<br>
Reflux Disease (symptomatic GERD) with no esophagitis, NUD<br>
 (Non Ulcer Dyspepsia), gastric cancer (including gastric<br>
cancer accompanied with the production promotion of<br>
interleukin-1? caused by gene polymorphism of interleukin-<br>
1), gastric MALT lymphoma and the like; the eradication of<br>
Helicobacter pylori, the suppression of upper digestive<br>
tract hemorrhage caused by the digestive ulcer, acute<br>
stress ulcer and hemorrhagic gastritis; the suppression of<br>
upper digestive tract hemorrhage caused by invasive stress<br>
(stress caused by major operation which requires intensive<br>
management after operation and by cerebro-vascular accident,<br>
head lesion, multiorgan disorder and wide range burn which<br><br>
require intensive care), and the treatment and prevention<br>
of ulcer caused by non steroid anti-inflammatories; the<br>
treatment and prevention of hyperchylia and ulcers caused<br>
by stress after operation, etc. The granules and capsules<br>

other active ingredients (for example, 1 to 3 active<br>
ingredients) for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and<br>
the like.<br>
 Examples of the "other active ingredients" include,<br>
for example, an antibacterial such as an anti-Helicobacter<br>

capsules of the present invention with the antibacterials<br>
are preferable. Among these, the combination with an<br>
antibacterial such as an anti-Helicobacter pylori active<br>
substance and an imidazole compound is preferable.<br>
Examples of the anti-Helicobacter pylori active substance<br>
include, for example, penicillin antibiotic (for example,<br>
amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, mecillinam and<br>
the like), cephem antibiotic (for example, cefixime,<br>

erythromycin antibiotic such as erythromycin and<br>
clarithromycin), tetracycline antibiotic (for example,<br>
tetracycline, minocycline, streptomycin and the like),<br><br>

 Further, for example, in case of lansoprazole,<br>
capsules containing 15 mg of crystalline lansoprazole have<br>
been often filled in No.3 capsules, and capsules containing<br>
30 mg have been often filled in No.1 capsules. However, the<br>
granules containing an active ingredient at high<br>
concentration are unexpectedly obtained by providing an<br>
intermediate coating layer, compounding a basic inorganic<br>
salt stabilizer and further controlling the particle size<br>
of granules without damaging the stability of the active<br><br>
ingredient and preparation. Thus, since the amount of<br>
components other than the active ingredient can be reduced,<br>
capsules containing 15 mg can be miniaturized to No.4 to<br>
No.5 capsules and capsules containing 30 mg can be<br>
miniaturized to No.3 to No.5 capsules.<br>
 Further, No.1 to No. 3 capsule can be also used for the<br>
capsule containing 60 mg.<br>
 Further, in case of the optically active compound of<br>
lansoprazole, No.3 to No.5 capsule, No.2 to No.4 capsule<br>
and No.1 to No.3 capsule can be used for the capsule<br>
containing 30 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg respectively.<br>
 For example, since the capsule containing 60 mg of<br>
lansoprazole or lansoprazole R-isomer contains the active<br>
ingredient at high concentration and the capsule is<br>
miniaturized, it is easy to take and suitable for treatment<br>
of acid excessive secretion symptom including Zollinger-<br>
Ellison syndrome in particular.<br>
 Dose per day differs depending on the extent of<br>
symptom, age for administration objective, sexuality, body<br>
weight, timing of administration, interval, the kind of<br>
active ingredient and the like, and are not specifically<br>
limited. For example, when the drug is orally administrated<br>
to adults (60 kg) as an anti-ulcer agent, the dose is about<br>
0.5 to 1500 mg/day and preferably about 5 to 150 mg/day as<br>
active ingredient. These preparations containing these<br><br>
benzimidazole or imidazole compound may be divided to<br>
administer once a day or 2 to 3 times a day.<br>
 Further, the form of package may be also stabilized in<br>
order to improve the stability of the solid preparation of<br>
the present invention at storage or transportation. For<br>
example, the stabilization of the capsule preparation<br>
containing the benzimidazole or imidazole compound of the<br>
present invention can be improved by using package form<br>
such as package suppressing the permeation of oxygen and<br>
moisture, package replaced with gas (namely, package<br>
replaced with gas other than oxygen), vacuum package and<br>
package enclosed with a deoxidizer. The stabilization is<br>
improved by reducing oxygen amount with which the solid<br>
preparation is directly brought in contact, using these<br>
package forms. When a deoxidizer is enclosed, the<br>
pharmaceutical solid preparation is packed with an oxygen<br>
permeating material, and then another packing may be<br>
carried out together with the package.<br>
