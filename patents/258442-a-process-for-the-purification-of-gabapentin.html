"A PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF GABAPENTIN"<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the purification of gabapcentin. Gabapentin, namely 1 -aminomethyl-1 -cyclobexanacetic acid of formula<br><br>
is a drug widely used in therapy.<br>
The drug has been described for the first time in US 4,024,175 and, afterwards,<br>
several processes for its preparation have been disclosed in the patent literature.<br>
The main problem addressed by the known processes for the preparation of<br>
gabapentin is the purity of the compound, in particular the need to avoid the presence<br>
of a by-product, namely 2-aza-spiro[4.5]decan-2-one of formula<br><br>
also known-as gabapentin lactam, in view of its toxicity.<br>
In fact, according to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the amount of gabapentin lactam in the<br>
active ingredient gabapentin must be lower than 0.05%.<br>
Another important purity requirement for gabapentin is the chloride content which<br>
must be not more than 0.01% (i.e. not more than 100 ppm).<br>
For an almost exhaustive reference to the known processes for the preparation of<br>
gabapentin sec the following patent documents: US 4,024,175; WO 00/58268; WO<br>
02/034709; EP  1   475 366; US 4,152,326; US 4,960,931; US 5,068,413; US<br>
5,132,451; US 6,054,482; WO 99/14184; WO 99/18063; WO 03/031391;  US<br>
4,956,473;     US 5,095,148;     WO 98/28255;     WO 00/64857;     WO 00/39074;<br><br>
wo 02/044123; WO 2004/031126; WO 02/074727; US 6,521,788; US 6,518,456;<br>
WO   03/062185;   WO   03/070683;   WO   20047101489;   WO   03/089403;   WO<br>
2004/046084; WO 2004/046085; WO 2004/046108; US 2004/0176639; EP 1468985;<br>
WO 2004/093779; WO 2004/093780 and any counterpart thereof.<br>
As it can be seen from tbc above listed prior art literature, in most of the processes<br>
for the preparation of gabapentin, a gabapentin salt, generally the gabapentin<br>
hydrochloride, is the last synthetic intermediate. This salt is in most cases subjected<br>
to ion exchange treatment or to neutralization with a suitable base or acid for the<br>
conversion to gabapentin.<br>
According to other processes, gabapentin is obtained directly from a precursor by<br>
reduction, hydrolysis or similar reactions.<br>
Gabapentin is finally isolated in solid crystalline form from a solution or suspension<br>
of pure gabapentin. Especially when an ion exchange resin is used, the work-up of an<br>
aqueous solution of pure gabapentin is required to isolate gabapentin in solid<br>
crystalline form.<br>
However,   in  most  of the  known  processes,  this  work-up   comprises   a   long<br>
evaporation of water under reduced pressure and gentle heating (25-45C).<br>
Even under these mild conditions, the prolonged heating of a gabapentin solution<br>
inevitably results with the formation of the undesired lactam with the consequent<br>
decrease of overall yields and the need of an additional purification of solid<br>
gabapentin to keep the lactam content below the required limit of 0.05%.<br>
We have now found that the formation of lactam during the usual work-up of<br>
gabapentin solutions can be remarkably lower by adding hydrochloric acid.<br>
Therefore, object of the present invention is a process for isolating pure gabapentin<br>
from an aqueous solution or suspension of gabapentin which comprises:<br>
(a)	providing an aqueous solution or suspension of gabapentin,<br>
(b)	concentrating the gabapentin solution or suspension up to obtain a slurry, and<br>
(c)	isolating pure gabapentin from the slurry,<br>
characterized in that a diluted or concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid in an<br><br>
amount, expressed as hydrochloric acid, ranging from 3 g to 20 g for 1000 g of<br>
gabapentin is added before, during or after the concentration of the gabapcntin<br>
solution or suspension of step (a).<br>
Gabapentin obtained with the process object of the present invention is pure stable<br>
gabapcntin with a lactam content lower than 0.05% and a chloride content not more<br>
than 0.01% (100 ppm), according to the Pharmacopoeia requirements.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the process of the present invention is particularly<br>
suitable for the preparation of pure stable gabapentin containing more than 20 ppm of<br>
chloride from hydrochloric acid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the process object of the present invention is<br>
particularly suitable for the preparation of pure stable gabapentin containing more<br>
than 20 ppm of chloride from hydrochloric acid starting from a solution of<br>
gabapentin containing a carboxylic acid alkaline salt<br>
The aqueous solution or suspension of step (a) according to the present invention is a<br>
solution of essentially pure gabapentin in a solvent mixture containing water,<br>
preferably a solution of gabapcntin in water.<br>
When the aqueous solution or suspension of step (a) of the present process contains<br>
one or more additional solvents, the additional solvent or solvents arc usually an<br>
organic solvent miscible with water, preferably an alcoholic solvent or a mixture of<br>
alcoholic solvents.<br>
Preferred alcoholic solvents are methanol, ethanol, n-propranol, isopropanol, n-<br>
butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, t-butanol and mixture thereof.<br>
Methanol, cthanol, isopropanol and mixture thereof are the most preferred, a mixture<br>
of methanol and isopropanol being still more preferred.<br>
The aqueous solution of step (a) can also contain some amounts of a base depending<br>
on the process for the preparation of gabapentin it comes from. Usually the base can<br>
be ammonia or an amine, especially a secondary o tertiary amine, or a carboxylic<br>
acid alkaline salt In this case the amount of hydrochloric acid to add, according the<br>
process object of the present invention, will be higher due to the neutralising cifect of<br><br>
the base.<br>
Moreover, depending on the used synthetic process for the preparation of gabapcntin,<br>
the aqueous solution or suspension of step(a) of the present process can contain some<br>
amounts of salts which can eventually have a neutralizing effect to be calculated<br>
when the addition of hydrochloric acid is carried out<br>
The man skilled in the art can easily evaluate the eventual effect of any salts present<br>
in the gabapentin solution/suspension of step (a) according to the present process and<br>
adjust the amount of hydrochloric acid accordingly.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous solution of step (a) of the present process is<br>
an aqueous solution coming from the elution of an ion exchange resin.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the aqueous solution comes from the elution<br>
through a strong cationic exchange resin and can contain some ammonia.<br>
The concentration according to step (b) of the present process can be carried out<br>
before, during or after the addition of hydrochloric acid.<br>
The concentration is carried out according to known methods, generally by gentle<br>
heating at a maximum temperature of 40-45C and under reduced pressure.<br>
The length of the concentration step mainly depends on the amount of water in the<br>
aqueous solution or suspension of gabapentin and on the heating temperature.<br>
Also the subsequent isolation of pure gabapentin is carried out according to known<br>
methods. The man skilled in the art will appreciate that any conventional isolation<br>
method can be-used for-step(c) of the present invention. <br>
In a practical embodiment of the process object of the present invention, the isolation<br>
is carried out by filtration or centrifugation of the solid gabapentin obtained after<br>
treatment of the slurry from step (b) with an alcoholic solvent or with a mixture of<br>
alcoholic solvents.<br>
Preferred alcoholic solvents arc methanol, cthanol, n-propranol, isopropanol, n-<br>
butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, t-butanol and mixture thereof.<br>
Methanol, cthanol, isopropanol and mixture thereof are the most preferred, a mixture<br>
of methanol and isonronanol being still more preferred.<br><br>
The filtered or centrifuged gabapentin from step (c) of the present process is washed<br>
according to usual methods.<br>
Preferably one or more washings with small volumes of the same alcoholic solvents<br>
used for the treatment of the slurry according to step (c) above are carried out, before<br>
drying the solid gabapentin.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process object of the present invention the final<br>
washing is carried out with a mixture of methanol and isopropanol, eventually in the<br>
presence of an electrolyte. A preferred electrolyte in the washing mixture is sodium<br>
chloride.<br>
The characterising step of the process object of the present invention is the addition<br>
of hydrochloric acid.<br>
This addition can be carried out at any step of the whole purification process and this<br>
versatility is one of the advantageous features of the process.<br>
As already underlined, the addition of hydrochloric acid can be made before, during<br>
or after the concentration step (b). Preferably this addition is carried out at the last<br>
phase of the concentration step (b).<br>
The added hydrochloric acid can be used as a diluted or concentrated aqueous<br>
solution, but a concentrated aqueous solution is preferred to minimize the amount of<br>
additional water.<br>
For practical reasons, a 31% w/w concentrated aqueous hydrochloric solution is most<br>
preferably used in the process object of the present invention.<br>
The amount of hydrochloric acid will range from 3 g to 20 g for each 1000 g of<br>
gabapcntin  and will depend also from the eventual presence  of bases in  the<br>
solution/suspension/slurry containing gabpentin which hydrochloric acid is added to.<br>
In the presence of some amounts of a base it will be necessary to add an increased<br>
amount of hydrochloric acid, generally from 9 g to 20 g/1000 g of gabapcntin.<br>
In the absence of bases in the solution/suspension/slurry containing gabapcntin, an<br>
amount of hydrochloric acid falling within a narrower range, generally from 3 g to 15<br>
g/1000g of gabapentin, will be suitable.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the process object of the present invention, a concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid solution is added to a slurry of gabapcntin in methanol, isopropanol and water.<br>
The addition of hydrochloric acid during the work-up for the isolation of pure gabapentin, according to the present invention, allows to reduce the formation of toxic gabapentin lactam usually occurring during the work-up. Therefore, this addition of hydrochloric acid represents a single solution to a well-known and difficult-to-solve problem related to fee manufacturing of gabapentin. The simplicity of the addition of hydrochloric acid toggether with its versatility, which makes it suitable for practically any known process for the preparation of gabapentin, is at the same time the most advantageous and the most unexpected feature of the present invention.<br>
It is worth noting, in this respect, that most of the industrial processes for the preparation of gabapentin provides for the preparation of a gabapentin acid addition salt, generally the gabapentin hydrochloride salt, followed by its conversion to gabapentin.<br>
It is evident to the man skilled in the art that, after the addition of hydrochloric acid according to the process object of the present invention, some hydrochloric gabapentin salt will be formed.<br>
For this reason, the process object of the present invention is particularly suitable for the preparationof gabapentin cotaining more than 20 ppm of chloride from hydrochloric acid.<br>
However, pure gabapentin containing less than 20 ppm of chloride from hydrochloric acid can be prepared with the process object of the present invention as well. A practical preferred embodiment of the process object of the present invention is the following.<br>
An aqueous gabapentin solution containing ammonia is obtained by elution through a strong cationic exchange resin. This aqueous solution is heated at a temperature of 40-45oC under reduced pressure.<br><br>
During the first phase of the heating ammonia evolves and the concentration is<br>
continued under the same conditions pp to obtaining a slurry.<br>
After treatment of the slurry with a mixture of methanol and isopropanol, an aqueous<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid solution is added and gaibapeatin is separated by<br>
ccntrifugation. After washings with a mixture of methanol, isopropanol and sodium<br>
chloride, the resultant pure gabapentin is dried in oven at a temperature not more<br>
than 45oC.<br>
The resultant gabapentin has a content of lactam lower than 0.05% and a chloride<br>
content not more than 0.01%, according to Pharmacopocia requirements.<br>
To better illustrate the present invention without limiting it the following examples<br>
are now given.<br>
