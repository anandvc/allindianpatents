				<td>The invention concerns a heat stable oil-in-water emulsion and a process for its preparation.<br>
GB Patent No. 1,525,929 concerns a water-in-oil emulsion, with phospholipoprotein containing material (for example egg yolk) modified by phospholipase A (PLA). This emulsion is stable, i.e. when exposed for 30 min. to 100°C. Although this emulsion is effectively heat stable, the great disadvantage is that the egg yolk is enzymatically modified, and secondly die suppression of any residual activity of PLA by proteases is not possible since the proteolytic enzymes would modify the egg yolk proteins and PLA alone can only be inactivated at very high temperature (160°C). Another disadvantage of enzymatically modified egg is that it often has a bitter off taste.<br>
It has now been found that it is possible to prepare a heat stable oil-in-water emulsion by using umnodified egg yolk as emulsifying agent, said emvdsion having no residual PLA. The present patent application describes the heat ■ stabilisation of egg yolk by a compound that is neutral in taste and low in price.<br>
The invention concerns a heat stable oil-in-water emulsion containing fi-om 1 to 82 % oil, from 0.1 to 20 % egg yolk, salt and/or sugar, aroma, water and 0.1 to 5 % diacetyl tartaric acid ester of monoglyceride (reffered to as DATEM in this specification) and having a pH of 3 to 8.<br>
The DATEM is commercially obtainable either as a powder or as a paste. In case of a powder, a paste is made by dissolving 20 % powder into 80 % water (90°C) and subsequent cooling thereof.<br>
The type of product according to the invention is an edible product like sauces, dressings, desserts and mayonnaise. By oil we mean all food grade oils such as soy bean oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, peanut oil, com oil, butter oil, butter fat and also cream.<br><br>
In the case of sauces, the emulsion preferably contains from 5 to 70 % oil, butter and/or cream.<br>
In the case of dressings, the emulsion contains more water and from 5 to 30 % oil.<br>
In the case of mayonnaise, i.e. a product with a high fat content, the product preferably contains from 50 to 82 % oil, from 0.1 to 10 % vinegar and has a pH of 3 to 5.<br>
In the case of desserts, the emulsion contains from 5 to 50 % oil, most preferably around 30 % and from 0.1 to 50 % sugar. Under the wording sauce, any type of sauce is included, for example Sauce HoUandaise, Sauce Carbonara. Under the wording dessert, creme anglaise are more preferably included.<br>
From a general point of view, the obtained emulsion is heat-stable, meaning that it can withstand UHT-treatment (less than one min at 140°C) or sterilization at 110°C for 10 minutes.<br>
The amount of salt and/or sugar used is preferably from 0.1-3 % salt and 0.1-30 % sugar. Aromas and ingredients which lead to savoury or sweet products may also be added.<br>
The egg yolk source is commercially available egg yolk separated from egg white from hen eggs, quails or ostriches stabilised with NaCl (8-10 %) or sucrose (20 %), or egg yolk in the powdered form. The egg yolk content of the emulsion is preferably between 0.1 and 20 %. All the percentages given are by weight. The emulsion contains preferably between 0.5 and 1.5 % DATEM (dry weight) in the sauce and dressings case and between 0.1 and 3 % DATEM (dry weight) in the case of mayonnaise and desserts. A too small amount of DATEM cannot give the required heat stability.<br>
Concerning now the way of preparation, for the mayonnaise, the emulsion is produced without heat-treatment. On the contrary, for a sauce, a dressing or dessert, the production process includes heat-treatment, such as pasteurization, sterilization or UHT treatment. Except for the sauce, the DATEM can be mixed<br><br>
with all the ingredient in the recipe in one step and sterilized. It is also possible to make an homogenisation after the mixing and before the heat-treatment.<br>
The invention concerns further the process for the preparation of a sauce wherein DATEM and egg yolk are mixed together and homogenized at high pressure (comprised between 50 and 150 bar), water, oil, salt and/or sugar, aroma and thickener are added to the obtained mixture which is again homogenized and heat treated.<br>
Heat stability of mayonnaises is tested by heating 10ml of emulsion in a test tube in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes. Heat-stability of sauces, dressings and desserts is tested by UHT treating (140°C for 10 sec.) or sterilising (110°CforlO min.). After cooling, a 100ml sample is reheated in a microwave oven (650 watt) at maximum setting for 2 min. Alternatively 500 ml is reheated in a microwave oven (650 watt) at maximum setting for 2 min. Alternatively 500ml is reheated to boiling point in a glass beaker on a kitchen hot plate. The emulsions are judged visually and emulsions showing oil separation are considered unstable. Structural properties such as roughness and smoothness are determined from the visual appearance of the emulsion. Expert opinion is used.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing a heat-stable oil and water emulsion sauce which comprises homogenizing a mixture of unmodified egg yolk and of diacetyl tartaric acid ester of monoglyceride ("DATEM") emulsifying agents to obtain a homogenized mixture and combining the homogenized mixture with ingredients comprising an edible oil, water, a thickener component and an ingredient<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of salt and sugar to obtain a further mixture and so that the further mixture comprises, by weight, the oil in an amount of from 5% to 70%, the unmodified egg yolk in an amount of from 0.1% to 20% and the DATEM in an amount of between 0.5% and 1.5% (dry weight) and homogenizing the further mixture to obtain an emulsion which is heat-stable, and then heating the emulsion at a temperature and for a time to at least pasteurize the emulsion to obtain a heat-treated emulsion product. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example, in which;<br>
Example 1	Sauce Hollandaise<br>
For a 60 kg of Hollandaise Sauce, 5% egg yolk (9.3% salt) was mixed with 5% water. DATEM paste was added (5%), mixed and homogenised at high pressure. Butter, aroma, salt, sugar, thickener and the rest of the water were added, heated to 50°C, emulsified for 3 min at 3000 rev/min in a batch mixer, homogenised once more at high pressure and UHT treated at 140°C for 6 seconds. It was cooled to room temperature and it was heat stable after reheating as described previously.<br>
Example 2	Sauce Carbonara<br>
For a 4 kg batch of Sauce Carbonara, 2.5% DATEM paste was mixed with<br>
3% egg yolk (9.3% salt), meat pieces, salt, thickener, cream and water in a<br>
batch	<br><br>
mixer. It was subsequently sterilised (110°C for 20 minutes). It was cooled to room temperature and it was heat stable after reheating as described previously.<br>
Example 3	freme Anglaise<br>
For a 100 kg batch of Creme Anglaise, 1 % DATEM paste was mixed with 3.75 % egg yolk (20 % sugar) cream, sugar and water and UHT treated (140°C, 20 seconds). After cooling, the product had an acceptable texture and taste.<br><br><br>
