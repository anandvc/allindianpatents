DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough disclosure. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the art disclosed may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known features may have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the art disclosed.<br><br>
[0029] The present disclosure provides a user friendly navigation scheme to media and media players. The disclosure provides for a menu system that overlays the video on a DVD, and can be viewed and selections made during playback/viewing of a video stream. The menu system may offer a plurality of options to the user. For example, the menu system may offer menu options normally available from the main menu screen of a DVD. This may include selecting scenes from the media without interrupting playback of the media.<br>
[0030] In another embodiment, the system and method add on-screen menus to control playback and features of the media. For example, controls such as play, fast forward, rewind, pause, etc. that are normally found on a remote control would be displayed on-screen and be selectable by the user. Therefore, the menu system provides an alternate method of controlling playback of media from the standard remote control. The system and method apply to video players, including but not limited to DVD players, software DVD-ROM players, high definition video players, hard drive based players, optical players, personal computers, or any other media player known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0031] In another embodiment, the user may guide a cursor around the video screen using a remote control, mouse, keyboard, joystick, or any other device known to one of ordinary skill in the art for directing a cursor on a screen. The cursor can be used for selecting menu options. Selecting may comprise clicking, highlighting, scrolling, and hovering. The cursor may also be utilized for relocating or resizing a window in the display. The cursor may appear as an arrow or any other shape. In one embodiment, the shape of the cursor relates to the theme of a movie. In an alternative embodiment, the cursor may substantially highlight an on-screen button or video.<br>
[0032] Figure 1 illustrates a media playback device 100. In one embodiment, the media player contains a CPU 115 and embedded software to simultaneously display menu options and stream video to a display. The menu items may be retrieved from the media in which the video is stored. Menu items may include graphics used on the video, lists of options, relations of lists of options, sounds used in hovering, alternate graphics used in hovering, etc. For example, if the video is stored in a DVD, the DVD also would contain the corresponding graphics for the menu options.<br>
Through the embedded software, the CPU 115 retrieves the menu items from the media and stores them in volatile memory 170. Alternatively, the menu items may be stored in non-volatile memory 180.<br>
[0033] In another embodiment, generic menu items may be used. In the case where menu items are not provided within the media, the embedded software may use pre-stored menu items that would allow the user to navigate the contents of the video media through an on-screen guide. The CPU 115 may retrieve from nonvolatile memory 180 generic menu items. Once the menu items and graphics necessary to control and navigate the media are loaded in memory 170, the CPU 115 would then map the contents of the media to the menu items and build an appropriate menu to navigate the contents of the media. The CPU 115 is then ready to act upon the selection of the menu options. After loading of the menu items, the CPU 115 automatically starts playing the video in the media. The user may select to invoke the available menu options if desired.<br>
[0034] The available menu options may be invoked in different manners. In one embodiment, the CPU 115 displays a selectable menu icon. If the menu icon is selected, the CPU 115 retrieves the menu items and corresponding graphics from memory 170 and displays a list of available menu options. Once the user navigates the contents and features of the video, the user may select the menu icon again to remove the menu items being displayed on the screen. The user may select the menu icon, navigate the contents of the media, and select the menu icon again to remove the menu on the screen, while at the same time being able to continue watching the video. The user may select the a menu option through the use of a mouse or any other device that allows control of a cursor on the display 120. The mouse connects to the media playback device through a user input 160 is connected to the CPU 115 so that the CPU 115 recognizes the commands entered by the mouse.<br>
10035] In another embodiment, the user may invoke a menu option by depressing a button on a remote control. The remote control enters data to the CPU 115 through a user input 160. If the appropriate button on the remote control is depressed, a list of available menu options is displayed. The user may then navigate through the <br>
video and the menu options while the video is playing. The user is able to continue this activity while the video is still playing in the display 120.<br>
[0036] In another embodiment, menu options or other selectable items in the video may appear automatically as part of a command by the embedded software within the media. For example, for scenes that have been provided with multiple angles, the video may trigger an automatic menu showing options that if selected would allow the user to view the video the scene in a selected alternate angle.<br>
[0037] In another embodiment, an automatic menu may also appear if the video is streaming a section where the movie may take an alternate ending, or an alternate plot. Once the section in the video with an alternate plot is showing, an automatic menu would be displayed showing the possible alternate endings. The streaming of the movie would continue unless the user selects one of the options.<br>
[0038] In another embodiment, if an item is for sale online, a menu would automatically be displayed along with options for purchasing the item. The item for sale may be pointed out by highlighting it. For instance, if a movie displays a person using a cell phone, and the cell phone is a featured item for sale, an automatic menu specific t the cell phone would appear. The menu could contain purchasing information, education information on how cell phones work, or specifications of the cell phone in the movie. In another embodiment, the featured item for sale may be highlighted in the screen and a user may click on the cell phone to view a menu specific to the cell phone.<br>
[0039] The display of automatic menus may be set to last for a user-determined period of time. For example, a user may set the menu to last for five seconds and then disappear from the screen. A user may also remove the menu from the screen by selecting the menu icon.<br>
[0040] In another embodiment, the menu options may be superimposed on the region of the display 120 where the video is playing. If the menu options are superimposed, the menu options may appear semitransparent so as to minimize blocking the view of any part of the displayed video. In another embodiment, the menu options may be shown in a region of the display 120 that is reserved for a menu options to appear. In other words, the region of the display 120 where the<br><br>
video show and the region of the display 120 where the menu shows are predetermined by the user or by the CPU 115 in the media player 100.<br>
[0041] Alternatively, the region of the display 120 where the video is playing may be automatically reduced, thus providing space for the menu options to appear on the display 120. Once the menu is automatically removed or removed by the user, the video image is resized to its original size.<br>
[0042] An on-screen menu provides a plurality of options. In an exemplary embodiment, as show in Figure 2, a screen shot from a DVD video image illustrates a main menu 200. The main menu 200 is superimposed on top of the video stream 210, which is playing in the background. The menu may be viewed without the video streaming being interrupted. Also without playback interruption, a user may hover over menu options, navigate through submenus and select other video contents and features. The main menu 200 offers various options. One such option may be to view the playback controls 220, access available features 230, view online related material 240 or access available activities 250. The selection of an option might be enabled by pressing a particular button on a remote control or by pressing on a menu option button.<br>
[0043] In one embodiment, the selection button may trigger a submenu to appear. For example, pressing on button labeled as "Controls" 220 may activate any available control buttons. As shown in Figure 3, the main menu buttons disappear, and the new submenu buttons are placed on the screen. The on-screen submenu is displayed without the video streaming 350 being interrupted. The on-screen controls submenu would be composed of standard control buttons 300 such as rewind 301, previous 302, play/pause 303, stop 304, next 305, and fast forward 306. The onscreen controls submenu would also include advanced control buttons such as Scene Select 320, Audio/Video Set Up 330, and Viewing Rights 340.<br>
[0044] Usage of the submenu controls does not interrupt video streaming 350. The user may hover on any submenu button with the video simultaneously playing. The user may select any standard playback control button 300 expecting the video streaming to be modified according to his selection. For example, if the user presses on fast forward 306, video streaming will effectively show fast forward of the video<br>
until another control option is selected or until the length of the video is consummated. In the same manner, other standard control buttons may be available to control the video playback. Standard control buttons include a play button, a pause button, a stop button, a fast forward button, a rewind button, a next button, and a back button.<br>
[0045] Further, the user may select any advanced playback control button expecting yet another submenu. Advanced control and feature buttons include a purchase button, a documentary button, a games button, a features button, a commentaries button, a thumbnail button, or a thumbnail button with an embedded video. For example, the user may select the Scene Select button 320.<br>
[0046] Figure 4 is another screen shot which illustrates an exemplary embodiment wherein scene selections can be made by the user. Once the user selects the Scene Selection button 320, another submenu 400 appears. Submenu 400 is displayed across the bottom portion of the screen and includes thumbnail buttons showing the starting frame of each available scene. The user can scroll through the thumbnails without the video stream 410 being interrupted. The user may then select a scene by pressing on the thumbnail 420.<br>
[0047] Figure 5 illustrates a scene thumbnail being selected from the Scene Selection menu 500. In another embodiment, when a scene thumbnail 510 is selected once, the video being played in the background 520 is automatically switched to that of the selected scene.<br>
[0048] In another embodiment, the thumbnails in submenu 500 may be selected causing the video of the scene portrayed in the thumbnail 510 to start playing. The video would play within the thumbnail, while the main video stream 410 continues to play. If the user decides that he wants to watch the scene in full view, then he may select the thumbnail 510 again, and the selected scene will start playing as the main video stream 520. The second selection may also be achieved by a double-click on the menu thumbnail 510.<br>
[0049] In another embodiment, thumbnails may include different video sources. In other words, each thumbnail 510 represents a different movie, a documentary, trailer, etc., originating from sources other than the media player. For instance, the<br>
media player may be connected to the Internet, and if a specific thumbnail is selected, a particular video may be downloaded from the Internet. Likewise, the video source may be a personal computer attached to the media player. The personal computer would have a hard drive with stored videos that are selectable by the media player.<br>
[0050] The main menu displayed on the media player may include other options to access to features included in the media. Figure 6 shows that the user has selected the option "Features" which triggered a new submenu 600 to appear. The feature submenu may include options to view additional material that is associated with the contents of the video. Such material may be commentaries accessible by selecting the "Commentaries" button 610. There may also be an option to view outtakes by selecting a button "Outtakes" 620. The "Karaoke" option 630 provides users with an option to sing along with characters or songs from the video. "Documentaries" 610 is yet another option that may be available for viewing additional content.<br>
[0051] Figure 7 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the art disclosed wherein the user selects to view "Commentaries" 610. The primary video stream 710 continues playing in the background while a video stream of the commentary 700 is displayed in the comer of the screen. The commentary video stream 700 may be synchronized to the video playing in the background 710, such that the commentary 700 is chronologically relevant to the portion of the primary video 710 that is playing at a given time.<br>
[0052] In another embodiment, a main on-screen menu of the media player may include other options such as allowing the user access to online information regarding the video. Figure 8 is an exemplary screen shot of the options available within an "Online" menu 800. The submenu 800 would provide options such as retrieving audio or video updates through a network connection. For example an online submenu may include Audio/Video Updates 810, Trailers 820, Songs 830, Wishlists 840, Events 850. A user may chose what trailer or song to download and store. Conventional DVD media, for example, included all available trailers in the media. Having online access to information associated to the video gives the user more flexibility in deciding what trailers or songs to store.<br>
[0053] In another embodiment, a main on-screen menu of the media player may include other options such as providing multiple activities associated with the video displayed. Figure 9 is an exemplary screen shot of the options available within an "Activities" menu. The submenu 900 would provide options that would include, among other things, interactive games, puzzles, and trivia. In exemplary screen shot of Figure 9, there are four games to choose from: "Rocket Zapper" 920, "Alien Hunt" 930, "Design an Alien" 940, and "Catch Stitch" 950.<br>
[0054] For example, as illustrated in Figure 10, if a user selects to view a the Documentaries menu, a window 1010 showing smaller video streams may appear and play while the primary video stream 1020 is being played in the background. In the lower left-hand corner the additional video tracks 1010 are displayed in "Multi-view Mode" as described above. The user may select one of the additional video streams using their remote control. Figure 11 shows how a user has selected a documentary 1110 from one of the four video streams. The selected video stream is 1110 now shown alone in the window shown in the lower left-hand comer while the background primary video image continues playing 1120.<br>
[0055] In one aspect, tha media playback device 100 in accordance with the present disclosure receives at least two streams of media data. Optionally, the at least two streams of media data are streamed to the video player 100 such that the media data of a first data stream corresponds in timing to at least a second data stream. The data streams may be logically multiplexed data feeds or from multiple sources, or a combination of the two.<br>
[0056] Data streams may be logically multiplexed data feeds, as illustrated by multiplex data feed 45. Multiplex data feed 45 is a combination of data feeds 10, 20, 30, 40 encoded in the same data feed 45. Data feeds 10, 20, 30, 40 may be transmitted from a CD, CD-ROM, DVD, DVD-ROM, television cable provider, or other data storage or transmittal device known in the art for providing multiple data streams. In an exemplary embodiment, a high definition video player contains a movie along with an additional four multiplexed video and audio tracks. These additional four multiplexed video and audio tracks contain scenes and additional material. The four multiplexed video and audio tracks are timed to match related<br>
content in the movie playing from the main video stream. Multiplexed data feed 45 may communicate with video player 100 through wireless means or a wired network.<br>
[0057] Simultaneously, an audio and/or video feed from the Internet 50 may be transmitting to video player 100 from an Internet source. The Internet source includes a personal computer, personal media player, or other device known in the art for transmitting data from the Internet. The Internet source may communicate with video player 100 through wireless means or a wired network.<br>
[0058] Therefore, a first stream of media data may be displayed on a video display and a secondary stream of media data may be simultaneously displayed within a smaller video sub-window on the video display. Figures 12a illustrate how a user can use the remote control or mouse to resize a video sub-window. A window 1210 shows the video streaming of the selected documentary. While the video is playing in window 1210, the entire screen 1200 is displaying the primary video streaming. As further illustrated by Figure 12b, the user may resize the documentary window 1210.<br>
[0059] When the user watching the videos sees something interesting she may press a button on her remote control and swap the desired video feed 1210 and the main movie feed 1200. Then, as shown in Figure 12c, the movie appears in the smaller window 1210 and the once-windowed track now appears full screen 1200. Furthermore, the user may guide a cursor around the video screen using a remote control, mouse or other device.
