				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present invention generally relates to telecommunication systems, and more particularly to a technique for achieving best-effort and reliable delivery, together with fragmentation and framing. The invention includes procedures for re-transmission, fragmentation and framing, while operating with a single sequence space, in a link protocol of a communication system. A single sequence space is utilized and, therefore, a single link protocol for providing best-effort and reliable data transfer is used. At the transmitter, the link protocol re-transmits a missed data packet, while at the receiver, the link protocol re-sequences the missed packet. The link protocol further provides fragmentation, framing and re-assembly of data packets. The fragments may be either a part of a higher layer packet or a complete higher layer jacket. A first field, indicating the type of delivery employed for each packet, is added in the header of the link protocol. The delivery may be Best Effort or Reliable, which is indicated by one bit of information with 0 for denoting Best Effort packet and 1 for Reliable. A second field, indicating the framing information of each higher layer packet is added in the link protocol header. This Segment Info field may include two bits: a First Segment bit, identifying the first segment of the higher layer packet, and, a Last Segment bit, identifying the last segment of the higher layer packet. Another field for Sequence Number is included in each segment of the packet, for identifying missed packets or segments by the receiver. These fields are used by the link protocol for performing fragmentation, re-assembly, framing and retransmissions.</td>

				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the field of communication technology. It generally relates to transfer of data between a transmitter and a receiver, which are part of a communication system and has a link protocol that provides best effort and reliable delivery mechanisms along with fragmentation and framing. Specifically it falls to a reuse of the link protocol to data transfer, both reliable and best effort, using a single instance of link protocol. More accurately it is a system and method for performing reliable and best effort data transfer in a communication system to perform retransmission, fragmentation and framing using a single sequence space in a link protocol.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There are sophisticated technologies available in the prior art for data transmission over a communication network. Two modalities of data delivery have known in prior art: best effort delivery (non-reliable data delivery) and reliable data delivery-<br>
US patent titled "Data transmission using common sliding" (US Patent No 7072973) describes a networking protocol that supports the sending of reliable and non-reliable data in a common sliding window. Here the data to be sent is packaged into package or frames, where each frame has a header. Each frame also includes a sequence number, which indicates the order in which the frames are sent. The sender then sends the frame to a recipient over an appropriate communication network, (e.g., UDP, modem, etc.) As the packets are received, the recipient of the packets keeps track of the sequence numbe/s of received packets to determine whether any packets are missing and selectively acknowledges those packets that have been received. The selective acknowledgment is performed using a mask, where each bit in the mask indicates the presence or absence of a packet as an offset<br>
from a reference value. Based on the mask, the sender re-sends non-received reliable packets, and creates a second mask which indicates non-reliable non- received packets that will not be re-sent. As per the prior art, the system employ the link protocol to attain the reliable data delivery by assigning the sequence number which retransmit the missed data units at the transmitter and re-' sequencing of data units if received out of order. The link protocol is often used<br>
r	——	-■<br>
in wireless communication systems due to the foreseen error rate.<br>
One of the major disadvantage of the above prior art is that the retransmission of the lost packets is undertaken only in the case of a reliable packet. But in the case of a non-reliable packet, the packet is not retransmitted, even if the packet is not received by the recipient.<br>
*	——	—	—R<br>
Another US patent titled'Methods and Protocol for simultaneous tuning of reliable and non-reliable channels of a single network communication link" (US Patent No 6438603) states an application layer protocol that supports reliable and non-reliable message transfer between a local and remote computer on a shared communication link. In the instant prior art application layer protocol (DP Protocol) uses a non-reliable transport layer protocol to implement both reliable and non-reliable channels over the shared link. When application programs want to send reliable data messages, they designate the data as such, and the application layer protocol sends the data in reliable messages with a request for acknowledgement. When application programs want to send non-critical data, they designate the data as such, and the application layer protocol sends the data in non-reliable messages that are not re-sent when dropped. Though it does not ensure delivery of non-reliable messages, the application layer selectively uses a request to acknowledge the non-reliable messages to gather<br>
■	1	J<br>
operational data about the link. Acknowledgements are requested in the form of ACKs (Acknowledgement) or NACKs (Negative Acknowledgement) for both reliable and non-reliable packets. The protocol uses requests for acknowledgement for the dual purpose of ensuring reliable delivery for reliable messages and maintaining operational characteristics used to tune the link. In particular, the protocol uses the operational characteristics to detect link<br>
saturation, tp calculate outbound bandwidth, to calculate a wait time for clearing backlogged messages and for adjusting the send rate based on the calculated bandwidth. This scheme enables the protocol to adapt the send rate based on varying link conditions.<br>
Yet another US patent titled "Methods and apparatus for data transmission" (US Patent No. 7072309) describes a communication system, which request retransmission of data and can be either Negative Acknowledgement (NAK) based, or Acknowledgement (ACK) based.<br>
A notable disadvantage of all the above prior art documents is that none of them provides an effective method for retransmission of non-reliable data. In- some of them functionalities of retransmission and fragmentation are performed by two separate link protocols. Each link protocol has its own sequence space, resulting in two sequence spaces for said functionalities. One such example is Signaling Link Protocol used in EVDO (SLP-D and SLP-F).<br>
Another drawback is that the protocol architecture may become complex due to separation of best effort and reliable data transfer. It is also a drawback that in some prior arts, more resources may be required, since fragmentation, framing and reliable data transfer is not considered as the scope of a single sequence space in a link protocol.<br>
r 11	11			 		 		 *<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above described problems and therefore preferably has an object to create a link protocol that performs retransmission, fragmentation and framing using single sequence space in a single link protocol instance for both best effort and reliable data transfer.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to^ make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Before going to the ins and outs of the invention let us see the context in which the invention is used. The invention is used in data transmission over a communication network especially in telephone networking. Its objective is for the best effort and reliable data transfer along with fragmentation and framing in a link protocol over a communication network. It describes the procedures involved for retransmission, fragmentation and framing when operating with a<br>
single sequence space, in a link protocol. The present invention requires only<br>
		—■<br>
one sequence space and hence one link protocol to provide best effort and reliable data transfer.<br>
Over a communication network, data transfer is between transmitter and ——	<br>
the receiver. In the present invention the transmitter in the link protocol forms one or more fragments with higher layer packet as payload. The higher layer packet is split to multiple fragments if the lower layer transmission capability is less than the higher layer packet size. Each such fragment is assigned a unique sequence number from the same sequence space by the link protocol-<br>
According to the present invention, the manufacturers are placed in an advantageous situation to utilise the particular features present on a single space link protocol for best effort and reliable data transfer over a communication network.<br>
The current invention provides a single link protocol, which performs retransmission at the transmitter and re-sequencing at the receiver for each missed data packet. It also provides fragmentation, framing and re-assembly of data packets. The layer above link protocol, whose data is transferred, is referred as Higher Layer, in the below description. The fragment referred in the below description can be a part of the higher layer packet or a complete higher layer packet. Also link protocol contains a header, which is added to each packet at the transmitter, with information required for retransmission, fragmentation, and framing.<br>
The Delivery Type field is generally filled by the transmitter based on the information provided by the higher layer for each packet. Higher layer could indicate whether the packet needs to be transmitted as a Best Effort or Reliable packet and corresponding values are filled in header of each of the fragment transmitted by the link protocol. First Segment and Last Segment fields are filled by the transmitter based on the position of the fragment in the higher layer packet. The receiver uses the First Segment, Last Segment fields along with the sequence number to re-assemble the complete higher layer packet. The receiver in the link protocol will receive packet in sequence. Receiver assembles the fragments of a packet using First segment and last segment and delivers the packets to layer above link protocol. The receiver cannot assemble the packets if some of the link layer protocol packets are lost-<br>
Similar to method in prior art, a field, Delivery Type, is added in the link protocol header to indicate the type of delivery for each packet, which would be Best Effort or Reliable. The Delivery Type field may be one bit of information taking a value of 0 for denoting Best Effort packet and a value of 1 for identifying that the packet is reliable-<br>
While indicating the framing of information to each higher layer packet, a segment info field is added to the link protocol. The Segment Info field may be 2 bits, one referred as First Segment, for identifying whether the segment is the first segment of the higher layer packet, and another referred as Last Segment, for identifying whether the segment is the last segment of the higher layer packet. A field for Sequence Number is present in each segment of the packet, which is used by the receiver for identifying missed packets or segments. Fields specified herewith are used by the link protocol to perform fragmentation, re- assembly, framing and retransmissions.<br>
The current invention takes advantage of the new method of using single<br>
									^<br>
space for retransmission, fragmentation and framing. A single link protocoj instance is sufficient for facilitating both reliable and best effort traffic. While using this, the memory can be reduced and used for other applications and protocol architecture can be simplified.<br>
The transmitter will complete transmitting all the fragments of a higher layer packet before transmission of next higher layer packet. This ensures that the fragments of any best effort and reliable higher layer packet will not be interleaved during transmission..<br>
Referring to Fig 1 depicts Transmitter Procedures in an ACK based link protocol. From FIG1 it can be seen that for reliable data delivery in the higher layer, Link Protocol Data Transmitter starts an ACK timer for each fragment transmitted. The transmitter does not start an ACK timer for fragments of packets, which can be delivered by best effort. For reliable delivery fragments transmitter expects an ACK from the receiver within a period of ACK timer. If an ACK is received from the receiver before the ACK timer expires for a reliable fragment, the ACK timer is stopped and the fragment is not retransmitted. If the transmitter does not receive the ACK for the reliable fragment till ACK timer expiry, the fragment is retransmitted by the transmitter<br>
There could be plurality of such retransmissions by the transmitter, which is modified based on the requirements and constraints of the link protocol and higher layer protocols. This plurality is termed as ACK rounds. For achieving plurality of retransmissions by the transmitter, the transmitter restarts the ACK timer after the first ACK timer expiry and after the first retransmission of the data unit. The transmitter expects an ACK only for the reliable fragments, to be received within ACK timer interval. The transmitter stores the reliable higher layer packets in queues till the ACK is received from the receiver or till a Stale timer interval, so that the fragments can be retransmitted. The transmitter does not queue the best effort higher layer packets.<br>
Fig 2 depicts the Receiver Procedures in an ACK based link protocol.<br>
Link Protocol Data Receiver receives fragments of best effort and reliable higher layer packets without any interleaving. All the received fragments are re¬assembled to form higher layer packets based on first segment and last segment and passed to higher layer.<br>
When a first segment of best effort packet is received, all the following received link layer protocol receives the segments of the same packet until next link layer packet is received by the first segment set.<br>
All the link layer protocol packets received after receiving the first segment of a best effort packet will belong to the same packet till a link layer protocol packet with last segment bit set is received. If any of the fragments are missed before last fragment is received, all the fragments of best effort packets are discarded till first segment of a best effort packet is received.<br>
When reliable fragments are received, the receiver sends ACK for sequence number of each fragment. The link protocol starts an abort timer for each missed reliable fragment. The abort timer is set to the time within which the receiver expects the transmitter to retransmit the missed fragments. The value for abort timer is decided based on the value of ACK timer used in the transmitter and the ACK rounds configured for the link protocol.<br>
As a preferred embodiment of the current invention, the link protocol in the receiver identifies whether one or more missed fragments belong to a best effort packet. If all of the missed fragments can be identified as best effort fragments, the abort timer need not be started for these fragments. If the number of missed fragments is one, and if the current fragment received is the middle or the last fragment of a best effort packet, the missed fragment can be identified as fragments of best effort packets, and abort timer need not be started for the missed fragments.<br>
Suppose the number of missed fragments is one, and if the previous fragment received is the first or the middle fragment of a best effort packet, the missed fragment can be identified as fragments of best effort packets, and abort timer need not be started for the missed fragments. If the number of missed fragments is two,'and if the current fragment received is the middle or the last fragment of a best effort packet, and if the previous fragment received is the first or the middle fragment of a best effort packet, the missed fragment can be identified as fragments of best effort packets, and abort timer need not be started for the missed fragments.<br>
In all other cases, where the missed fragments can not be identified to be fragments of a best effort higher packet the abort timer will be started at the receiver for all the missed fragments.<br>
As an embodiment of the invention, once the abort timer is started at the receiver, the received reliable fragments which form a complete packet with the missed fragments are queued by the link protocol in the receiver, and are not passed onto the higher layer, and the received fragments which form complete packets are passed to higher. In the receiver, the link protocol not only ensures that the abort timer is started for the missed reliable fragments, but also takes care that the queue due to missed reliable fragments does not impact the delivery of complete packets to the higher layer. When abort timer expires for the missed fragments, the received fragments which form partial packets are discarded or passed to higher layer.<br>
Fig.3 depicts Transmitter Procedures in a NAK based link protocol<br>
As an embodiment of the invention, once the higher layer packet is transmitted in one or more fragments the transmitter stores the delivery type for all sequence numbers and payload for the sequence numbers carrying reliable packet. This information is stored by the transmitter for a period of stale timer. This information is used by the transmitter to identify the delivery type for each sequence number when a NAK is received from the receiver for missed fragments. One skilled in the related art may note that the NAK will be sent by the receiver for sequence number of best effort packets, since the receiver does not have information about whether the sequence numbers corresponding to missed fragments belong to a best effort or a reliable higher layer packets.<br>
When a NAK is received from the receiver, the transmitter ignores the sequence numbers whose delivery type is best effort using information in the transmitter stored while transmitting the higher layer packets. Transmitter retransmits the payload (fragment of higher layer reliable packet) for the reliable sequence numbers conveyed in the NAK. The link protocol may support a plurality of such retransmissions based on the requirements and capabilities of the higher layer protocol and the link protocol.<br>
Fig 4 depicts the Receiver Procedures in a NAK based link protocol. Receiver is receiving fragments of best effort and reliable higher layer packets without any interleaving. All the received fragments are re-assembled to form higher layer packets based on first segment and last segment and passed to higher layer. When a first segment of best effort packet is received all the following received link layer protocol receives the segments of the same packet until next link layer packet's first segment set is received.<br>
All the link layer protocol packets received after receiving the first segment of a best effort packet will belong to the same packet till a link layer protocol packet with last segment bit set is received. If any of the fragments are missed before last fragment is received, all the fragments of best effort packets are discarded till first segment of a best effort packet is received.<br>
The link protocol starts an abort timer for each missed reliable fragments and sends a NAK for the sequence numbers. The abort timer is set to the time within which the receiver expects the transmitter to retransmit the missed fragments. The receiver cannot identify whether the missed fragments belong to best effort packet or reliable packet. In some cases explained below receiver can identify that all the missed fragments belong to best effort in which case receiver need not start abort timer and send a NAK. One skilled in the related art may note that NAK may be sent with sequence numbers corresponding to fragments of best effort packets.<br>
Figure 5 depicts Identification of missed fragments as Best Effort.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention, the link protocol in the receiver identifies whether one or more missed fragments belong to a best effort packet in the following manner. If all of the missed fragments can be identified as best effort fragments, NAK need not be sent by the receiver and abort timer need not be started for these fragments. If the number of missed fragments is one, and if the current fragment received is the middle or the last fragment of a best effort packet, the missed fragment can be identified as fragments of best effort packets, NAK is not sent and abort timer need not be started for the missed fragments. If the number of missed fragments is one, and if the previous fragment received is the first or the middle fragment of a best effort packet, the missed fragment can be identified as fragments of best effort packets, NAK is not sent and abort timer need not be started for the missed fragments. If the number of missed fragments is two, and if the current fragment received is the middle or the last fragment of a best effort packet, and if the previous fragment received is the first or the middle fragment of a best effort packet, the missed fragment can be identified as fragments of best effort packets, NAK is not sent and abort timer need not be started for the missed fragments.<br>
In all other cases, where the missed fragments cannot be identified to be fragments of a best effort higher packet, the receiver sends a NAK for missed sequence numbers and starts an abort timer.<br>
As an embodiment of the invention, once the abort timer is started at the receiver, the received reliable fragments which form a complete packet with the missed fragments are queued by the link protocol in the receiver, and are not passed onto the higher layer, and the received fragments which form complete packets are passed to higher. At the receiver, the link protocol not only ensures that the abort timer is started for the missed reliable fragments, but also takes care that the queue due to missed reliable fragments does not impact the delivery of complete packets to the higher layer. When abort timer expires for the missed fragments, the received fragments which form partial packets are discarded or passed to higher layer.<br>
The link protocol may incorporate a NAK mechanism with plurality of NAK sent by the receiver for each missed data unit. The receiver in the link protocol does not know whether the missed data units are best effort or reliable, and plurality of NAK may be sent by the receiver for best effort fragments.<br>
As another embodiment of the invention, the transmitter on receiving a NAK will inform the receiver that few data units missed by the receiver were best effort, and so, the receiver need not send further NAK for those best effort fragments. The receiver will stop sending NAK for the sequence numbers of best effort fragments on receiving this delivery type information from the transmitter.<br>
Alternatives<br>
1. In the invention, the best effort fragments are discarded by the link protocol in the receiver, if some of the best effort fragments are lost. This is one method, and an alternative is to send the partial best effort fragments to higher layer. Further recovery of complete packet with partial fragments is assumed to be the responsibility of the higher layer.<br>

Each subsequently described alternatives embodiments are to be interpreted in the light of the foregoing descriptions. Also numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of components and/or methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that an embodiment of the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other apparatus, systems, assemblies, methods, components, materials, parts, and/or the like.

h) the receiver identifies, where possible, (based on first segment, last segment fields and delivery type of current received packet),the delivery type of missed packets and a determination that the missed packets belong to best effort data transmission decides not to send NAK if link is configured as NAK^ based and does not wait for retransmission for those missed packets if link is,. configured as ACK based.<br>
2)	The method according to claim 1 wherein the delivery field contains 0 for best effort data transmission and T for reliable data transmission.<br>
3)	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the link protocol re-transmits a missed data packet at the transmitter whereas it re-sequences the missed packet at the receiver.<br>
4)	The method according to Claim 1, wherein the fragments may be either a part of a higher laver packet or a complete higher layer packet.<br>
5)	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the field segment info<br>
~	~							"&gt;•<br>
contains, two bits, a first segment bit which identify the first segment of<br>
• • —&gt; ■—&gt;—<br>
the higher layer packet and a last segment bit, identifying the last^ segment of the higher layer packet.<br>
6)	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the higher layer packet is split intn multiple fragments with unique sequence number.<br>
7)	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the delivery of packets by the<br>
transmitter based on the information provided by the higher layer for each<br>
■ —	 ■»<br>
packet.<br>
8)	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the link protocol receiver receives the reliable fragments and sends acknowledge signal (ACK) for sequence number of each fragment.<br>
9)	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the link protocol in the<br>
" —	* — •<br>
receiver identifies whether one or more missed fragments belong to a best effort packet.<br>
10)	A system for the best effort data transfer with fragmentation and framing in link protocol, substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
11) A method for, performing reliable and best effort data transfer with fragmentation and framing in link protocols substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings1	I</td>
