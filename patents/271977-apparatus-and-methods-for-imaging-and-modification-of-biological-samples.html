				<td>Title: Apparatus and methods for immaging and modification bilogical samples 	<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to modification of biological samples which comprise a<br>
plurality of cells. More particularly, it concerns enrichment of a sample with respect to cells<br>
of interest to assist further analysis thereof.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
During the study of biological samples, it is common to have samples that contain cells of<br>
particular interest within a mixture of cells. It may be useful to enrich the sample with<br>
respect to the cells of interest in the population for further processing and analysis.<br>
This capability is of interest within the research area to provide an understanding of<br>
mechanisms of a cellular process, where the technique has applications for example in the<br>
study of cell differentiation, cell lineage and fate, of system development, in the area of<br>
regulation, in the response to any external stimulus, to provide new knowledge and<br>
understanding. This capability is also of interest for the diagnosis of a disease or disorder<br>
(detecting presence of a condition, evaluating the extent of a condition) by comparing the<br>
results with normals; and for evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment by looking at<br>
changes over time.<br>
Typically, a particular cell type exists within a heterogeneous population of multiple cell<br>
types. Examples include differentiated cells within a tissue sample and stem cells [So 2004];<br>
cancer cells and blood vessels within a tissue sample; neurons growing in a substrate of<br>
supporting cells; fetal cells in maternal blood; white blood ceils of various types (natural<br>
killer cells. etc) in blood samples; metastatic cancer cells in tissues samples, etc. In addition<br>
a particular cell type may itself consist of a heterogeneous population with respect to some<br>
particular characteristic. For example, the cells may consist of subgroups of cells at different<br>
 <br>
positions in the cell cycle, including being quiescent (non-dividing). In addition, the cells<br>
may be responding to the environment in different ways or be activated in different ways,<br>
and thus expressing different proteins or molecules of interest or entire processes or<br>
pathways.<br>
One current approach to sort cells is to use a flow cytometer or a Fluorescence Activated<br>
Cell Sorter (FACS) machine. The practice is to label the cells with one or more fluorescent<br>
labels, to disperse the cells in a suitable carrier medium, and to pass that carrier medium<br>
containing the cells through the FACS machine, in which the carrier is formed into droplets<br>
by passing through a nozzle. The resulting droplet is exposed to a beam of excitation light,<br>
causing the fluorescent label in an individual cell to fluoresce and emit light which is<br>
detected in the form of a signal, which is used to form the basis of a classification decision to<br>
accept or reject the cell, and divert it into a receptacle for further processing. Multiple labels<br>
can be used to determine various states of the cell and thus make more complex<br>
classification decisions. Such an approach is able to sort cells at modest rates, with good<br>
discriminating ability when the fluorescent label has the necessary sensitivity and selectivity.<br>
However this approach suffers from a number of drawbacks. Sample preparation and rough<br>
handling may perturb the sample and limits it to a single passage. This will be a problem if <br>
the cells exist in a supporting matrix and/or the interaction between cells is to be maintained<br>
so that only non-adherent cells are used. In addition, since the FACS process involves some<br>
delay, this means that some fine-grained temporal and kinetic information is lost making<br>
some studies very difficult eg synchronization of cell cycle. In addition, the data collected<br>
from each cell is of a fairly coarse nature, making it difficult to distinguish between distinct<br>
spatial organizations of the label, due e.g. to translocation processes.<br>
In an alternative approach, the sample may be analysed manually under a microscope with a<br>
micro-dissecting stage. Markers (stains) may be added to allow different cell types,<br>
components and structures to be visualized, distinguished and manipulated. This is slow,<br>
laborious and error-prone, and it is difficult to prevent cross-contamination between sample<br>
components or the use of live objects. It is not feasible if the cell type is rare.<br>
 <br>
In a further technique, a laser may be used for micro-dissection and to cut around the cells of<br>
interest [Wiltke 2005; Schuetze 1997], This helps to prevent contamination problems.<br>
Alternatively, optical tweezers may be used to displace small scale, biological objects, but<br>
cannot effectively perform certain types of operation such as the cutting or removal of<br>
undesired attached material. Laser ablation can also be used to remove unwanted material.<br>
In an another approach, the sample may be lysed and probed for particular molecules or<br>
combinations of molecules such as DNA, UNA or proteins using a microarray. This<br>
approach can be very sensitive and selective. However it can be quite slow, preventing fine<br>
temporal information from being accessed, and it is generally destructive of the cell under<br>
study, thus preventing the collection and further use of cells of a particular type.<br>
Summary and detailed description of the invention.<br>
The present invention provides a method of modifying a biological sample, comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
(a)	providing a sample comprising a plurality of cells which include a photosensitive<br>
compound that can be induced by light irradiation to inactivate or kill at least part of the<br>
respective cell;<br>
(b)	acquiring an image of at least a portion of the sample;<br>
(c)	identifying cells of interest in the sample image;<br>
(d)	selecting cells other than the cells identified in step (c); and<br>
(e)	irradiating only those cells selected in step (d) with a light beam so as induce the<br>
photosensitive compound therein to inactivate or kill at least part of those cells, and thereby<br>
enrich the sample with respect to the cells of interest for further analysis.<br>
The technique proposed herein involves locating and identifying the cells of interest from a<br>
population of live cells, preferably using one or more suitable markers, with suitable image<br>
acquisition instrumentation capable of targeting an irradiating light beam onto a specific cell<br>
or part, of an unwanted cell. With the introduction of one or more suitable photosensitive<br>
comoouncs, the irradiating light beam acts to modify the photosensitive compound. Based<br>
 <br>
on the appearance of a cell, a decision may be made to direct and activate the irradiating<br>
light beam, and thus result in the release of a species in such a way as to kill it.<br>
Benefits of the present approach over the prior art are that it allows examination of greater<br>
numbers of samples than would be possible using a manually graded approach, and<br>
facilitates enrichment based, on: rarer events (such as cancer metastasis); faster events or<br>
events with fine grained temporal information (such as phase synchrony); multiple events,<br>
coincident events or events separated in time or space; difficult to see events or fine spatial<br>
detail; events occurring over a longer time scale, and enrichment of greater quality (more<br>
true positives, less false positive, less contamination), and with less interference with the<br>
sample under study.<br>
Preferred techniques have been developed by the present inventors for acquiring and<br>
analyzing images with marker probes and photo-sensitive compounds, which allows<br>
individual cells to be selectively irradiated and thus deactivated or killed.<br>
Enrichment of a sample by eliminating only a proportion of the cells of interest may<br>
facilitate some long term studies (tracking changes over time), and/or modulation or<br>
manipulation of the interaction between cells types.<br>
The use of a photosensitive compound enables enrichment in a well controlled manner,<br>
using a lower power light source (such as a low power laser) than is needed to destroy a cell<br>
using light alone.<br>
The following steps are envisaged in one implementation:<br>
1)	Present sample consisting of mixed population of cells;<br>
2)	Probe with marker molecule;<br>
3)	Introduce photosensitive compound (optional);<br>
4)	Stimulate sample (optional);<br>
5)	View sample with viewing optics (various imaging modes);<br>
6)	Refine viewing parameters including focus (optional);<br>
 <br>
7)	Acquire digital image set;<br>
8)	Process the image(s) to obtain an image measure ;<br>
9)	Classify cell of interest based on coincidence of one or more image measures;<br>
10)	Direct an irradiating light beam to a particular location in the sample at a particular<br>
moment in time in order to carry out an action on the sample;<br>
11)	Repeat from step 3 (introduce) step 4 (stimulate) or step 5 (view); or<br>
12)	Exit and further processing of the sample.<br>
The sample is typically a particular cell type within a heterogeneous population of multiple<br>
cell types. Examples include differentiating tissues with stem cells, progenitor, precursor and<br>
differentiated cells within a tissue sample.<br>
Furthermore a particular cell type may itself consist of a heterogeneous population with<br>
respect to some particular characteristic. For example, the cells .may consist of subgroups of<br>
cells at different positions in the cell cycle, including being quiescent (non-dividing).<br>
Alternatively the population of cells may be a heterogeneous population of cells of different<br>
cell types, or with some genetic variation, mutation or phenotype, or with different degrees<br>
of transfection of an agent.<br>
The cells may be responding to the environment in different ways or be activated in different<br>
ways, and thus expressing different proteins or molecules of interest or entire processes.<br>
The sample may be part of a cell, an organdie and/or cell region in a cell. Alternatively the<br>
population of cells may be an assembly of cells in 2D or 3D; a tissue sample; a biological<br>
fluid such as blood; a biopsy sample; an organ; an embryo; a part of an animal or a plant: or<br>
an entire animal or a plant.<br>
The marker molecule and photosensitive compounds may comprise one or more of the<br>
following: a fluorescence molecule; a luminescent molecule; an uncaging agent with an<br>
active part board to a chrornophore or fluorophore by a photo-oleavable link [Gnrney 1999];<br>
a lisand conjugated with a dye; a CALI reagent (a non-blocking autibody conjugated with a<br>
 <br>
dye [llag 2000]); a photosensitizer such, as KillerRed (marketed by Evrogen); a geneticallv<br>
encoded moleculs such as GFP; a photo-activatable molecule such as genetically encoded<br>
PA-GFP or caged molecule [Sawin 1999]; a photo-switching molecule such as KFP; a timer<br>
protein [Terskikh 2000][Verkhusha 2004]; a cell cycle marker; a voltage or potential<br>
sensitive marker; a biosensor; a multi-functional marker probe (multi-functional marker<br>
probes radicate the presence of multiple species by changes in the excitation emission profile<br>
with the presence of metal ions [Komatsu 2005] or kinases/phospholipases [Schultz 2005]);<br>
an exogenous molecule that binds to a genetically encoded tag; a conjugated quantum dot; a<br>
conjugated metallic nanop article; a conjugated encapsulated fluorescent nanoparticle; or it<br>
may rely on the fluorescence of an intrinsic molecule. Exogenous (non-genetically encoded)<br>
markers may be cell permeable. Genetically and non-genetically encoded markers may be<br>
introduced or may have been previously introduced into cells by a number of known<br>
techniques.<br>
Stimulation of the sample may include any external stimulus (biochemical, chemical,<br>
physical, thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, etc).<br>
The imaging modes may include one or more of the following: fluorescence at one or more<br>
excitation wavebands; luminescence; widefield; confocal; phase contrast; DIC; structured<br>
illumination; fluorescence lifetime; polarization; or multi-photon processes.<br>
The viewing parameters which may be modified may include the focus,plane of focus, field<br>
of view, excitation power level, wavelength and waveband, polarization, pulse regime, as<br>
well as detector parameters such as wavelength sensitivity, exposure timing and duration,<br>
location within a multi-sample holder, and the like.<br>
The digital image set may comprise one or more of the following: bright-field images;<br>
fluorescence images; confocal images at particular focal planes; fluorescence lifetime images<br>
in a range; images at particular wavebands from the infrared to the ultraviolet; a time<br>
sequence; an image stack, or any combination of the above.<br>
 <br>
Suitable image measures may include cell location, boundary, extent; cell morphology; cell<br>
division or position in the cell cycle; cell viability; image features such as intensity, relative<br>
intensity, change in intensity, texture measures; lifetime, relative lifetime, change in lifetime;<br>
spectral shift; movement, migration or motility; outgrowth; a cellular or sub-cellular event<br>
such as    translocaiion from cytoplasm to nucleus, membrane to nucleus,  organeile to<br>
nucleus, membrane to cytoplasm, organeile to cytoplasm, nucleus to cytoplasm, cytoplasm<br>
to membrane, nucleus to membrane, organelle to membrane,  cytoplasm to organeile,<br>

concentration; DNA content; DNA fragmentation; membrane potential; number and size of<br>
DNA loci; binding event; signaling; adhesion; or other measurement  such as  current,<br>
voltage, impedance, or transconductance.<br>
A classification decision may be made based on one or more measures falling above or<br>
below or within limits, comparison with a model, or statistical distance from, a set of<br>
examples; or some linear or non-linear mapping of the measures; or a classifier based on<br>
nearest neighbour; artificial neural network; support vector machine; pattern recognition; or<br>
genetic algorithm.<br>
The action carried out may inactivate or kill at least part of a cell. This may be achieved by<br>
flash photolysis, un-caging or releasing (a luminescence substrate such as luciferin [Yang<br>
1993] or coelenterazme; free radicals) a toxic substance, perforation of a cell wall,<br>
transfection, ablation or other modification of specific structures such as micro tubules; or<br>
activation of a pathway such as apoptosis.<br>
Further processing or analysis can include examination, harvesting, sorting, culture or<br>
treatment of the sample by dispensing of reagents.<br>
The invention further provides apparatus for carrying out the techniques described herein,<br>
which comprises: a detector for acquiring an image of at least a portion of the  sample; a light<br>
source for generating a light bearn to irradiate a selected region of the sampale and a<br>
 <br>
controller arranged to manipulate the light source to only irradiate at least part of each of a<br>
plurality of selected cells.<br>
Instrumentation which may be configured to provide steps 5 (view) to 10 (action) is<br>
described in an earlier patent application [Courtney 2005].<br>
The classification step may be based on data obtained from previous acquisitions; acquired<br>
from ocher imaging modalities (X-ray. CT, MRI, PET); from databases, or other external<br>
sources.<br>
The location, region and time point for the irradiation to take place may be based on<br>
information about the sample and the desired experimental protocol.<br>
The apparatus may be configured to study a single sample or a larger sample requiring<br>
motion of the viewing location between locations. Additionally multiple samples may be<br>
presented on a larger carrier, whereby the samples differ in some way (different cells,<br>
different reagents, different environment).<br>
Further applications of the techniques disclosed herein may include:<br>
screening for activity of drug'candidates by observing changes;<br>
-	screening for safety of drug candidates or therapeutic agents;<br>
detecting the presence of a disease or disorder (diagnosis);<br>
evaluating the extent of a disease or disorder (stratification);<br>
-	evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment; and<br>
discovery of biomatker to indicate any of the above.<br>

ultraviolet; a time sequence; an image stack; or any combination thereof,<br>
18.	A method of any preceding claim wherein said further analysis comprises one of:<br>
examination; harvesting; sorting; culture; or treatment of the sample by dispensing of<br>
reagents.<br>
19.	Apparatus for modifying a biological sample in accordance with a method of any<br>
preceding claim, comprising:<br>
a detector for acquiring an image of at least a portion of the sample;<br>
a light source for generating a. light beam to irradiate a selected region of the sample;<br>
and<br>
a controller arranged to manipulate the light source to only irradiate at least part of<br>
each of a plurality of selected cells.<br>
<br>
This invention relates to enrichment of a biological sample comprising a plurality of cells to assist further analysis<br>
thereof. It provides a technique comprising the steps of: (a) providing a sample comprising a plurality of cells which include a<br>
photosensitive compound that can be induced by light irradiation to inactivate or kill at least part of the respective cell (b) acquiring<br>
an image of at least a portion of the sample; (c) identifying cells of interest in the sample image; (d) selecting cells other than the<br>
cells identified in step (d) and (e) irradiating only those cells selected in step (d) with a light beam so as induce the photosensitive<br>
compound therein to inactivate or kill at least part of these cells, and thereby enrich the sample with respect to the cells of interest<br>
for further analysis.<br>
