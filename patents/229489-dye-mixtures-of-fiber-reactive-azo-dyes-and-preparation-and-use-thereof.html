				<td>DYE MIXTURES OF FIBER-REACTIVE AZO DYES AND PREPARATION AND USE<br>
THEREOF<br>
This invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.<br>
Mixed fiber-reactive azo dyes and heir use for dyeing hydroxyl- and carboxamido-<br>
containing material in black shades are known for example from the documents<br>
US 5,445,654, US 5,611,821, KR 94-2560, Sho 58-160362 and EP-A-0 870 807.<br>
However, they have certain applica ion defects, such as for example an overly<br>
large dependence of the color yield on varying dyeing parameters in the dyeing<br>
process or an insufficient or unlevel color build-up on cotton (good color build-up<br>
results from the ability of a dye to provide a proportionally stronger dyeing when<br>
used in higher concentrations in the dyebath), or an excessive salt dependence of<br>
the dyeings. Consequences of these defects can be poor reproducibilities for the<br>
dyeings that are obtainable. The documents WO 98/42784, WO 98/42785, WO<br>
93/18224 and US 5,330,539 disclose dyes and dye mixtures which can be dyed in<br>
the presence of small amounts of sals, but which provide only very weak dyeings<br>
in the absence of salt.<br>
Since it is commercially as well as en /ironmentally necessary to reduce the salt<br>
content of dyeing effluent, there is a need for reactive dyes which provide dyeings<br>
of high color strength in the presence of small amounts of salt or even in the<br>
absence of electrolyte salts.<br>
The present invention, then, provides dye mixtures which provide.dyeings of high<br>
coTor strength in the presence of only very low levels or even in the absence of<br>
electrolyte salts.<br>
The invention accordingly provides dye mixtures comprising one or more, such as<br>
two or three, preferably 1 or 2, dyes of he hereinbelow indicated and defined general<br>
formula (I)<br><br><br>
one or more, such as two or three, preferably 1 or 2, dyes of the hereinbelow<br>
indicated and defined general formula (II)<br><br>

where M and D2 are each as definsd above. It is particularly preferable for D2 to<br>

Dyes of the general formula (I) are known from EP-A1046677, the dyes of the<br>
general formula (II) are known in part from WO 9610610, WO 9725377,<br>
WO:9947608 and EP-A 922735.<br>
Dyes of the general formulae (15) and (16) are obtainable via standard synthetic<br>
methods or are in some instances ormed during the synthesis of dyes of the<br>
general formula (I). They are custo narily used as shading components.<br><br>
The dye mixtures according to the nvention can be present as a preparation in solid<br>
or liquid (dissolved) form. In solid form, they contain, to the extent necessary, the<br>
electrolyte salts customary in the case of water-soluble and especially fiber-reactive<br>
dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may<br>
further contain the auxiliaries custo mary in commercial dyes, such as buffer<br>
substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as<br>
sodium acetate, sodium citrate, socium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium<br>
dihydrogenphosphate and disodiun hydrogenphosphate, dyeing auxiliaries,<br>
dustproofing agents and small amounts of siccatives; when they are present in a<br>
liquid, aqueous solution (including a content of thickeners of the type customary in<br>
print pastes), they may also contain substances which ensure a long life for these<br>
preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
In solid form, the dye mixtures acco ding to the invention are generally present as<br>
powders or granules which contain electrolyte salt and which will hereinbelow<br>
generally be referred to as a prepamtion with or without one or more of the<br>
abovementioned auxiliaries. In the preparations, the dye mixture is present at 10 to<br>
90% by weight, based on the preparation containing it. The buffer substances are<br>
generally present in a total amount of up to 5% by weight, based on the preparation.<br>
When the dye mixtures according to the invention are present in an aqueous solution,<br>
the total dye content of these aqueo is solutions is up to about 50% by weight, for<br>
example between 5 and 50% by weight, the electrolyte salt content of these aqueous<br>
solutions preferably being below 10% by weight, based on the aqueous solution; the<br>
aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) can contain the aforementioned buffer<br>
substances in an amount which is generally up to 5% by weight and preferably up to<br>
2% by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are preparable in a conventional<br>
manner, as by mechanically mixing the individual dyes, whether in the form of their<br>
dye powders or granules or their as synthesized solutions or in the form of aqueous<br>
solutions of the individual dyes gene ally, which may additionally contain customary<br>
auxiliaries, or by conventional diazotization and coupling of suitable mixtures of diazo<br>
and coupling components in the desred amount ratios.<br><br>
For example, when the diazo components with the groups D2 and O3 in the general<br>
formulae (I) and (II) possess the same meaning (D2 = D3), an amine of the general<br>
formula (17)<br>
D2-NH2 (17),<br>
where D2 is as defined above can be diazotized in a conventional manner and the<br>
resulting diazonium compound ther reacted in aqueous medium at a pH below 3 with<br>
a mixture of 4-amino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid or 4-amino-5-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-1,7-disulfonic and and an optionally N-substituted 6-amino-4-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic acic or 3-amino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic<br>
acid to give a mixture of two red monoazo dyes of the formulae (15) and (II).<br>
Subsequently an amine of the general formula (18)<br>
D - NH2 (18),<br>
where D2 is as defined above is diszotized in a conventional manner and the<br>
resulting diazonium compound is then coupled in a second stage with the mixture of<br>
the monoazo dyes of the general formulae (15) and (II) obtained in the first stage,<br>
coupling taking place at a pH of between 3 and 7.5, to give a mixture of the dyes of<br>
the general formulae (I) and (II).<br>
Alternatively, where the diazo cormonents with the groups D1 and D3 in the general<br>
formulae (I) and (II) possess the same meaning (D1 = D3), the dye mixture of the<br>
invention can be prepared by conventionally diazotizing an amine of the general<br>
formula (18), where D1 is as defined in claim 1, and then reacting the resulting<br>
diazonium compound of an aqueo iS solution or suspension of a mixture of defined<br>
proportion of a red monoazo dye of the general formula (15) and an optionally<br>
substituted 6-amino-4-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, first with a pH below 3 to<br>
give a mixture of two red monoazo dyes of the general formulae (15) and (II), and,<br>
when acidic coupling is at an end, by raising the pH to 4 - 7.5, carrying out the<br>
second coupling of the monoazo dye of the general formula (15), giving a mixture of<br>
the two dyes of the general formula ae (I) and (II).<br>
The red monoazo dyes of the general formula (15) can be prepared by conventionally<br>
diazotizing an amine of the general formula (17), where D2 is as defined in claim 1,<br>
and then coupling the resulting diazonium compound in an aqueous medium at a pH<br><br>
below 2 with 4-amino-5-hydroxyna phthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid and/or 4-amino-5-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-1,7-disulfonic acid in a first stage.<br>
The dye mixture of the invention is solated in a conventional manner, where<br>
appropriate following the addition o one or more, such as two or three, yellow<br>
components of the general formulae (Illa) to (lllf), in solid form or as an aqueous<br>
solution, by salting out for example with sodium chloride or potassium chloride or by<br>
spray drying.<br>
Additionally, the as-synthesized solutions of the dye mixtures of the general formula<br>
(I) and (II) can be used directly as a liquid preparation for dyeing, where appropriate<br>
following addition of one or more, such as two or three, yellow components of the<br>
general formulae (Illa) to (lllf) in solid form or as aqueous solutions and also, where<br>
appropriate, addition of a buffer substance and, where appropriate, after<br>
concentration or dilution.<br>
Dye mixtures which as well as β-chloroethylsulfonyl or p-thiosulfatoethylsulfonyl or p-<br>
sulfatoethylsulfonyl groups also coniain vinylsulfonyl groups as reactive radicals can<br>
be synthesized not only starting from appropriately substituted vinylsulfonylanilines or<br>
naphthylamines but also by reaction of a dye mixture where Z is p-chloroethyl, p-<br>
thiosulfatoethyl or β-sulfatoethyl with an amount of alkali required for the desired<br>
fraction and converting the β-substituted ethylsulfonyl groups mentioned into<br>
vinylsulfonyl groups. This conversior is effected in a manner familiar to one skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
The d'ye mixtures according to the invention have useful application properties. They<br>
are used for dyeing or printing hydrocyI-and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for<br>
example in the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for<br>
example composed of polyamide, or in bulk, as for example polyamide and<br>
polyurethane, but especially for dyeing and printing these materials in fiber form.<br>
The present invention thus also provides for the use of the dye mixtures according to<br>
the invention for dyeing or printing those materials, or rather processes for dyeing or<br><br>
printing these materials in a conventional manner, by using a dye mixture according<br>
to the invention or its individual components (dyes) individually together as a<br>
colorant. The materials are preferatly employed in the form of fiber materials,<br>
especially in the form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form<br>
of hanks or wound packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example<br>
cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such<br>
as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example<br>
staple viscose and filament viscose and also chemically modified cellulose fibers,<br>
such as aminated cellulose fibers 01 fibers as described for example in WO 96/37641<br>
and WO 96/37642 and also in EP 0 538 785 and EP 0 692 559.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides<br>
and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other<br>
animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6 nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention can be applied to and fixed on the<br>
substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application<br>
techniques known for water-soluble dyes and especially for fiber-reactive dyes. For<br>
instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long liquor<br>
and also from a short liquor, for example in a liquor to goods ratio of 5 : 1 to 100 : 1,<br>
preferably 6 : 1 to 30 : 1, using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral<br>
salts as far as necessary, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having<br>
very good color yields. Application is preferably from an aqueous bath at<br>
temperatures between 40 and 105°C, optionally at a temperature of up to 130°C<br>
under superatmospheric pressure, but preferably at 30 to 95°C, especially 45 to<br>
65°C, in the presence or absence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. One possible<br>
procedure here is to introduce the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat<br>
the bath to the desired dyeing temperature and complete the dyeing process at that<br>
temperature. The neutral salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also<br>
if desired only be added to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been<br>
reached.<br><br>
Padding processes likewise provide excellent color yields and a very good color<br>
build-up on cellulose fibers, the dyes being fixable in a conventional manner by<br>
batching at room temperature o elevated temperature, for example at up to about<br>
60°C, or in a continuous manne; for example by means of a pad-dry-pad steam<br>
process, by steaming or using cry heat.<br>
Similarly, the customary printinc processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried<br>
out in one step, for example by printing with a print paste containing sodium<br>
bicarbonate or some other acid binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to<br>
103°C, or in two steps, for example by printing with a neutral to weak acidic print<br>
color and then fixing either by passing the printed material through hot electrolyte-<br>
containing alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-containing<br>
padding liquor and subsequent batching of the alkali-overpadded material or<br>
subsequent steaming or subsequent dry heat treatment of the alkali-overpadded<br>
material, produce strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground.<br>
The outcome of the prints is litt e affected, if at all, by variations in the fixing<br>
conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix<br>
processes, hot air at 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at 101<br>
to 103°C, it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at<br>
temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the dye mixtures<br>
according to the invention on the cellulose fibers are for example water-soluble basic<br>
salts of alkali metals and likew se alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids<br>
or compounds which liberate alkali in the heat, and also alkali metal silicates.<br>
Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to<br>
medium inorganic or organic a aids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the<br>
sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents are for example<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium nydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium<br>
hydrogenphosphate, sodium t ichloroacetate, trisodium phosphate or waterglass or<br><br>
mixtures thereof, for example mixtures of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and<br>
waterglass,.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention are notable for outstanding color<br>
strength when applied to the cellulose fiber materials by dyeing or printing in the<br>
presence of no or very small amounts of alkali or alkaline earth metal compounds.<br>
For instance, no electrolyte salt is equired for a shallow depth of shade, not more<br>
than 5 g/l of electrolyte salt is requred for a medium depth of shade and not more<br>
than 10 g/l of electrolyte salt is recured for deep shades.<br>
According to the invention, a shallow depth of shade refers to the use of 2% by<br>
weight of dye based on the substrate to be dyed, a medium depth of shade refers to<br>
the use of 2 to 4% by weight based on the substrate to be dyed and a deep shade<br>
refers to the use of 4 to 10% by weight of dye based on the substrate to be dyed.<br>
The dyeings and prints obtainable with the dye mixtures according to the invention<br>
possess bright shades; more particularly, the dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber<br>
materials possess good lightfastness and especially good wetfastnesses, such as<br>
fastness to washing, milling, watar, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and alkaline<br>
perspiration, also good fastness to pleating, hotpressing and rubbing. Furthermore,<br>
the cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment of rinsing to<br>
remove unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent wetfastnesses, in particular since<br>
unfixed dye portions are easily washed off because of their good solubility in cold<br>
water.<br>
Furthermore, the dye mixtures according to the invention can also be used for the<br>
fiber-reactive dyeing of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or<br>
low-felting finish (cf. for example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-<br>
Verlag, 3rd edition (1972), pages 295-299, especially finished by the Hercosett<br>
process (page 29a); J. Soc. Dyars and Colourists 1972, 93-99, and .1975, 33-44), can.<br>
be dyed to very good fastness properties. The process of dyeing on wool is here<br>
carried out in a conventional manner from an acidic medium. For instance, acetic<br>
acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium<br>
acetate can be added to the dyebath to obtain the desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of<br><br>
acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary leveling agent, for example a<br>
leveling agent based on a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with three times the<br>
molar amount of an aminobenzem sulfonic acid and/or of an<br>
aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example<br>
stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dye mixture according to the<br>
invention is preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic<br>
dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 o 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward<br>
the end of the dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline<br>
range up to a pH of 8.5 to bring at out, especially for very deep dyeings, the full<br>
reactive bond between the dyes o the dye mixtures according to the invention and<br>
the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber<br>
materials composed of other natu al polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a<br>
temperature of about 40°C, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then<br>
adjusted to the desired weakly ac dic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the<br>
actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the<br>
dyeings can also be carried out a' the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at<br>
temperatures of up to 106°C. Since the water solubility of the dye mixtures according<br>
to the invention is very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary<br>
continuous dyeing processes. The color strength of the dye mixtures according to the<br>
invention is very high.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention dye the materials mentioned, preferably<br>
fiber materials, in navy to jet black shades having good fastness properties.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages<br>
are by weight, unless otherwise stated. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume as<br>
the kilogram relative to the liter. 1 he compounds described in the examples in terms<br>
of a formula are indicated in the form of the sodium salts, since they are generally<br>
prepared and isolated in the forrr of their salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts,<br>
and used for dyeing in the form c f their salts. The starting compounds described in<br>
the examples hereinbelow can be used in the synthesis in the form of the free acid or<br><br>
likewise in the form of their salts, preferably alkali metal salts, such as sodium or<br>
potassium salts.<br>
Example 1<br>
70 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the navy disazo dye<br>
of the formula (IA)<br><br>
in a 70% fraction, 20 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the<br>
orange-red monoazo dye of the formula (IIA)<br><br>
in a 75% fraction and 10 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing the<br>
yellow disazo dye of the formula lllf-1)<br><br><br>
in a 70% fraction are mechanically mixed with each other.<br>
The resulting dye mixture according to the invention provides jet black dyeings and<br>
prints, on cotton for example, under the dyeing conditions customary for reactive<br>
dyes.<br>
Example 2<br>

in an 80% fraction and 10 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder containing<br>
the yellow disazo dye of the formula (lllc-1)<br><br><br>
in a 70% fraction are dissolved in 500 parts of water and the resulting dye solution is<br>
adjusted to pH 5.5-6.5. Evaporation or spray drying of this dye solution provides a<br>
dye mixture which provides jet black dyeings and prints on cotton under the dyeing<br>
conditions customary for reactive dyes.<br>
Example 3<br>
a) 281 parts of 4-((3-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)aniline are suspended in 650 parts of ice-<br>
water and 180 parts of 30% hydrochloric acid and diazotized by dropwise addition of<br>
173 parts of 40% sodium nitrite solution. 223 parts of 4-amino-5-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid and 72 parts of 6-amino-4-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic ac id are added and coupled in a first step at pH 1<br>
- 1.8 at below 20°C to form a n ixture of two red monoazo dyes conforming to<br>
the formulae (15-1) and (IIC). The stated pH range is set and maintained during<br>
the coupling reaction by addition of a total of about 1 50 parts of sodium<br>
bicarbonate.<br><br><br><br>
b) In a second, separate reaction vessel, 280 parts of 4-amino-N-(3-((β-<br>
sulfatoethyl)-sulfonyl)phenyl)ben; amide are suspended in 1600 parts of ice-<br>
water, adjusted to pH 6.5 - 7 wi:h about 35 parts of sodium carbonate and<br>
admixed with 122 parts of 40% sodium nitrite solution. This suspension is<br>
added dropwise to a mixture of 4 50 parts of ice, 350 parts of ice-water and 255<br>
parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After subsequent stirring at 5-1 0°C for 2<br>
hours, the excess nitrite is reduced with amidosulfonic acid and the resulting<br>
diazo suspension is pumped into the mixture of red monoazo dyes of a).<br>
Subsequently, at below 25°C, the reaction mixture is adjusted to a pH of 5 - 6 with<br>
sodium carbonate and, after the erd of the coupling reaction, 110 parts of the yellow<br>
monoazo dye of the formula (llla-1 are added in the form of an aqueous solution to<br>
this reaction mixture, and the resuling 73 : 16 : 10 mixture of the dyes (IB), (IIC)<br>
and (llla-1) is isolated by spray drying.<br>
Alternatively, the dye solution obtained can also be buffered at pH 5.5 - 6 by addition<br>
of a phosphate buffer and be adjusted by further dilution or concentration to provide a<br>
liquid brand of defined strength.<br>
The resulting dye mixture according to the invention dyes cotton in black shades.<br><br><br>
