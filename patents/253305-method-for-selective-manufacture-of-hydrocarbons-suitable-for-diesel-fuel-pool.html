				<td>Method for the manufacture of hydrocarbons<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for the manufacture of hydrocarbons from<br>
renewable sources and particularly to a selective method for the manufacture of<br>
hydrocarbons suitable for the diesel fuel pool. The invention also relates to a<br>
method for the manufacture of hydrocarbons with decreased consumption of<br>
hydrogen.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Environmental interests and an increasing demand for diesel fuel encourage fuel<br>
producers to employ more intensively available renewable sources. However,<br>
known processes, utilizing such sources tend to result in an increase in carbon<br>
dioxide emissions with generally known negative effects. In the manufacture of<br>
diesel fuel the main interest is focused on vegetable oils and animal fats<br>
comprising triglycerides of fatty acids. Long, straight and mostly saturated<br>
hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids correspond chemically to the hydrocarbons<br>
present in diesel fuels. However, the neat vegetable oils display inferior<br>
properties, particularly extreme viscosity, and thus their use in fuels is limited.<br>
Conventional approaches for converting vegetable oils into fuels comprise<br>
transesterification, hydrogenation and cracking, among others. Triglycerides,<br>
which form the main component in vegetable oils, are converted into the<br>
corresponding esters by the transesterification reaction with an alcohol in the<br>
presence of catalysts. However, poor low-temperature properties of the products<br>
obtained limit their wider use in regions with colder climatic conditions. Schmidt,<br>
K., Gerpen J.V.: SAE paper 961086 teaches that the presence of oxygen in esters<br><br>
results in undesirable higher emissions of NOx, in comparison to conventional<br>
diesel fuels.<br>
Thermal and catalytic cracking of bio-materials like vegetable oils and animal fats<br>
lead to a wide spectrum of products. US 5,233,109 describes an example of such<br>
process using catalysts containing alumina and another component, such as silica<br>
or alumino-silicate. The reactions are generally unselective and less valuable<br>
products are formed as well. The unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons present<br>
in the liquid fraction make these products unattractive for the diesel pool.<br>
Patents US 4,992,605 and US 5,705,722 describe processes for the production of<br>
diesel fuel additives by conversion of bio-oils into saturated hydrocarbons under<br>
hydroprocessing conditions. The conversion of the carboxylic group into a methyl<br>
group requires relatively high hydrogen partial pressure of above 4.5 MPa.<br>
Hydrogen consumption is further increased due to eventual side reactions such as<br>
methanation and reverse water-gas shift reaction. The high hydrogen consumption<br>
limits the use of such processes, especially in refineries where the hydrogen<br>
balance is already almost negative because of complying with legislative<br>
requirements.<br>
Undesired oxygen may be removed from fatty acids or esters by deoxygenation.<br>
The deoxygenation of bio-oils and fats to hydrocarbons, suitable as diesel fuel<br>
products, may be performed in the presence of catalysts under hydroprocessing<br>
conditions. During hydrodeoxygenation conditions oxogroups are hydrogenated<br>
and therefore this reaction requires rather high amounts of hydrogen.<br>
Additionally, hydrogen is consumed in side reactions as well.<br>
Decarboxylation of fatty acids results in hydrocarbons with one carbon atom less<br>
than the original molecule. The feasibility of decarboxylation varies greatly with<br>
the type of carboxylic acid used as the starting material. Activated carboxylic<br>
acids containing electron-attracting substituents in the position alpha or beta with<br><br>
respect to the carboxylic group lose carbon dioxide spontaneously at slightly<br>
elevated temperatures. In this case, the RC-COOH bond is weakened by the<br>
electron shift along the carbon chain.<br>
The majority of fatty acids are, however, not activated. The positive induction<br>
effect of the carbon chain evokes a high electron density in the position alpha with<br>
respect to the carboxylic group making thus the release of CO2 difficult. Although<br>
the decarboxylation of activated and non-activated carboxylic acids is<br>
thermodynamically comparable, the activation energy is significantly higher in the<br>
case of the latter one. Therefore drastic conditions or the presence of a catalyst are<br>
required to overcome the energetic barrier.<br>
The fusion of alkaline salts of fatty acids with the corresponding hydroxides to<br>
hydrocarbons is known already from the 19th century. The reaction is highly<br>
unselective and ketones and cracking products, as well as undesired highly<br>
alkaline waste are formed with low conversion.<br>
Further, there exist a number of decarboxylation reactions used mainly in organic<br>
synthesis. Most of them proceed via free radical mechanism.<br>
US 4,262,157 discloses a decarboxylation process utilizing diazacycloalkenes and<br>
Cu salts, wherein lauric acid reacts to form n-undecane with 51 % yield at 320 °C.<br>
Also decarboxylation of unsaturated acids to form hydrocarbons with one carbon<br>
less is described.<br>
Indirect decarboxylation routes are also known, involving transformation of<br>
carboxylic acids into the corresponding halides, followed by their dehalogenation.<br>
Hunsdiecker's and Kochi's reactions are examples of such reactions and both<br>
reactions proceed via free radical mechanism.<br><br>
Available alternative routes involve electrochemical and photo-catalytic<br>
decompositions. An example of electrochemical decomposition is the Kolbe<br>
electrolysis, wherein the reaction is started by anodic mono-electron oxidation<br>
leading to the formation of carboxylate radicals. Their subsequent decarboxylation<br>
results in probable formation of hydrocarbon radicals. Their dimerization or less<br>
often disproportionation leads to the termination of the free radical reaction. The<br>
electrolytic systems for the hydrocarbon synthesis usually comprise aqueous<br>
solvents, organic co-solvents, added salts and platinum electrodes. Under such<br>
conditions the reaction yields 50-90% of coupling hydrocarbon products. The<br>
main side products comprise 1-unsaturated hydrocarbons formed via<br>
disproportionation. A similar radical mechanism applies also for photo-<br>
catalytically initiated reactions.<br>
Two step deoxygenation of oxygen-containing bio-oil compounds is described by<br>
Parmon et al: Catalysis Today 35 (1997) 153-162. The model compound, phenol,<br>
is in the first step treated with carbon monoxide over bimetallic alloy RhCu. The<br>
product, benzoic acid, consequently decarboxylates in the presence of PtPd or<br>
RuPd alloys in the second step.<br>
The complexity of the decarboxylation reactions listed above and/or the low yield<br>
and very often, also the hazardous materials applied in the reactions, are the main<br>
drawbacks of these approaches.<br>
Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons by contacting carboxylic<br>
acids with heterogeneous catalysts was suggested by Maier, W. F. et al:<br>
Chemische Berichte (1982), 115(2), 808-12. They tested Ni/Al2O3 and Pd/SiO2<br>
catalysts for decarboxylation of several carboxylic acids. During the reaction the<br>
vapors of the reactant passed through a catalytic bed together with hydrogen.<br>
Hexane represented the main product of the decarboxylation of the tested<br>
compound heptanoic acid. When nitrogen was used instead of hydrogen no<br>
decarboxylation was observed.<br><br>
US 4,554,397 discloses a process for the manufacture of linear olefins from<br>
saturated fatty acids or esters. The catalytic system consists of nickel and at least<br>
one metal selected from the group consisting of lead, tin and germanium.<br>
According to the examples, when other catalysts, such as Pd/C were used, low<br>
catalytic activity, cracking to saturated hydrocarbons or formation of ketones<br>
when Raney-Ni was used, were observed.<br>
Decarboxylation, accompanied with hydrogenation of oxo-compound, is<br>
described in Laurent, E., Delmon, B.: Applied Catalysis, A: General (1994),<br>
109(1), 77-96 and 97-115, wherein hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derived<br>
pyrolysis oils over sulphided C0Moly-Al2O3 and NiMo/y-Al2O3 catalysts was<br>
studied. Di-ethyldecanedioate (DES) was used among others as a model<br>
compound and it was observed that the rates of formation of the decarboxylation<br>
product (nonane) and the hydrogenation product (decane) were comparable under<br>
hydrotreating conditions (260-300 °C, 7 MPa, in hydrogen). NiMo/y-Al2O3<br>
showed slightly higher selectivity towards decarboxylation products in<br>
comparison to CoMo/y-Al2O3 catalyst. The presence of hydrogen sulphide, in<br>
contrary to ammonia, also promoted the decarboxylation, particularly when NiMo<br>
catalysts were used.<br>
A process for converting an ester-containing vegetable oil into hydrocarbons is<br>
disclosed in GB 1,524,781. The conversion to hydrocarbons is performed over a<br>
catalyst containing an admixture of silica-alumina with an oxide of a transition<br>
state metal of groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, VA, VIA, VIIA, or VIIIA of the periodic<br>
table at the reaction temperatures of 300 - 700 °C. The products formed are<br>
reported to be free from oxygenated compounds (other than carbon dioxide and<br>
water). In accordance with the examples, extensive cracking is, however,<br>
observed.<br><br>
Based on the above it can be seen that there exists an evident need for an<br>
industrially applicable catalytic method for the selective manufacture of<br>
hydrocarbons from renewable sources, utilising the decarboxylation reaction.<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a catalytic method for the selective manufacture<br>
of hydrocarbons, which are suitable for diesel fuel pool, from renewable sources,<br>
such as plant and vegetable oils and fats and animal and fish oils and fats. The<br>
invention concerns the transformation of the starting materials comprising fatty<br>
acids, derivatives of fatty acids, such as esters of fatty acids as well as<br>
triglycerides of fatty acids, or metal salts of fatty acids, or combinations of<br>
thereof, into hydrocarbons with minimal consumption of hydrogen, by contacting<br>
the starting material with a heterogeneous catalyst comprising at least one metal<br>
selected from the metals belonging to the group VIII of the Periodic Table. The<br>
hydrocarbon product formed via the decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction has<br>
one carbon atom less than the original fatty acid or fatty acid portion of its<br>
derivate. Optionally the hydrocarbon product is isomerized.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that the deoxygenation of starting materials<br>
originating from renewable sources can be achieved by using an alternative<br>
reaction route - decarboxylation/decarbonylation, where oxygen is removed in the<br>
form of CO and CO2 from the original compounds in the starting<br>
material/feedstock. In this way hydrocarbons can be selectively manufactured<br>
from plant and vegetable oils and fats as well as animal and fish oils and fats<br>
without high consumption of hydrogen.<br>
The present invention is particularly directed to a method for the selective<br>
manufacture of hydrocarbons in the diesel fuel distillation range from renewable<br>
sources. The reaction conditions and the catalyst employed in the<br><br>
decarboxylation/decarbonylation process of bio-oils are essential for the<br>
invention. Under suitable conditions, hydrogen is required only for the reduction<br>
of the catalyst. Consequently, the consumption of hydrogen can be decreased<br>
significantly. The method may also comprise an optional catalyst pre-treatment<br>
step. Additionally the method may comprise an optional isomerization step.<br>
The method according to the invention comprises the steps wherein a feedstock<br>
originating from renewable sources and optionally a solvent or a mixture of<br>
solvents are brought into contact with an optionally pro-treated heterogeneous<br>
catalyst selected from supported catalysts containing one or more Group VIII<br>
metals, and a decarboxylation/decarbonylation. reaction is carried out at a<br>
temperature of 200 - 400°C, preferably 250 - 350°C under a pressure from<br>
atmospheric pressure (0.1 Mpa) to 15 MPa, preferably of 0.1-5 MPa to yield as a<br>
product a mixture of linear hydrocarbons, preferably linear paraffins boiling in the<br>
range of 180 - 350°C, the diesel fuel range, and having one carbon atom less than<br>
the original fatty acid chain.<br>
The heterogeneous catalyst is optionally pre-treated with hydrogen at a<br>
temperature of 100 - 500°C, preferably 150 - 250°C. The pre-treatment of the<br>
heterogeneous catalyst is preferable as it ensures the activity of the catalyst.<br>
The decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction is carried out in liquid phase, thus<br>
the reaction pressure is higher than the saturation vapor pressure of the feedstock<br>
at a given reaction temperature. The reaction pressure ranges from atmospheric<br>
pressure to 15 MPa, taking into consideration the properties of the feedstock.<br>
Optionally a gas flow comprising an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or argon,<br>
hydrogen or combinations thereof may be used for removing gaseous products<br>
formed during the reaction.<br><br>
The obtained product, hydrocarbon mixture, is optionally isomerized in order to<br>
convert further the obtained hydrocarbons to isomerized hydrocarbons with<br>
improved cold properties, such as cloud point and pour point.<br>
In the isomerization step, the pressure varies in the range of 2-15 MPa, preferably<br>
in the range of 3-10 MPa and the temperature varies between 200 and 500 °C,<br>
preferably between 280 and 400 °C. In the isomerization step, isomerization<br>
catalysts known in the art may be used. Suitable isomerization catalysts contain a<br>
molecular sieve and/or a metal selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table<br>
and/or a carrier. Preferably, the isomerization catalyst contains SAPO-11 or<br>
SAPO-41 or ZSM-22 or ZSM-23 or ferrierite and Pt, Pd or Ni and Al2O3 or SiO2.<br>
Typical isomerization catalysts are, for example, Pt/SAPO-1I/Al2O3, Pt/ZSM-<br>
22/Al2O3, Pt/ZSM-23/Al2O3 andPt/SAPO-11/SiO2. An isomerized product, which<br>
is a mixture of branched hydrocarbons and preferably branched paraffins boiling<br>
in the range of 180 - 350°C, the diesel fuel range, and having one carbon atom<br>
less than the original fatty acid chain, is obtained. Additionally some gasoline and<br>
gas may be obtained.<br>
Starting material<br>
The starting material or feedstock originates from renewable sources, such as fats<br>
and oils from plants and/or animals and/or fish and compounds derived from<br>
them, also known as bio-oils. Examples of suitable bio-oils are plant and<br>
vegetable oils and fats, animal fats and oils, fish fats and oils, and mixtures<br>
thereof containing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters. Particularly suitable<br>
materials are wood-based and other plant-based and vegetable-based fats and oils<br>
such as rapeseed oil, colza oil, canola oil, tall oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil,<br>
hempseed oil, olive oil, linseed oil, mustard oil, palm oil, peanut oil, castor oil,<br>
coconut oil, as well as fats contained in plants bred by means of gene<br>
manipulation, animal-based fats such as lard, tallow, train oil, and fats contained<br>
in milk, as well as recycled fats of the food industry and mixtures of the above.<br><br>
Preferably the feedstock comprises C8 - C24 fatty acids, derivatives of said fatly<br>
acids, such as esters of said fatty acids as well as triglycerides of said fatty acids,<br>
metal salts of said fatty acids, or combinations of thereof. The fatty acids or fatty<br>
acid derivatives, such as esters may be produced via hydrolysis of bio-oils or by<br>
their fractionalization, or by esterification reactions of triglycerides. Suitably<br>
triglyceride fractions of rapeseed oil, linseed oil, sunflower oil, tallow and lard<br>
and fractions of tall oil are used as the feedstock.<br>
The hydrocarbon products obtained utilizing the method according to the<br>
invention have one carbon atom less than the original fatty acid or the fatty acid<br>
fraction of its derivate in the starting material.<br>
Reaction conditions<br>
The decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction conditions may vary with the<br>
feedstock used. The reaction is carried out in liquid phase. The reaction is carried<br>
out at a temperature of 200 - 400°C, preferably 250 - 380°C. The reaction may be<br>
conducted under atmospheric pressure. However, in order to maintain the<br>
reactants in the liquid phase it is preferable to use higher pressure than the<br>
saturation vapour pressure of the feedstock at a given reaction temperature and<br>
thus the reaction pressure ranges from atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) to 15 MPa<br>
and preferably from 0.1 to 5 MPa, depending on the properties of starting<br>
material.<br>
Solvent<br>
The optional solvent is selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons, such<br>
as paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes and aromatic hydrocarbons in the boiling<br>
range of 150 - 350°C, and recycled process streams containing hydrocarbons, and<br>
mixtures thereof, preferably the recycled product streams obtained from the<br>
method are used.<br><br>
Gas flow<br>
Optionally a gas flow, which may also be called as carrier gas, comprising an inert<br>
gas such as nitrogen, helium or argon, or hydrogen or combinations thereof may<br>
be used for removing gaseous products formed during the reaction. The gas flow<br>
may be combined with the feedstock or it may be led to the reaction mixture or it<br>
may be led to different parts in the reactor. The feedstock may contain 0.1 - 40 vol.<br>
%, preferably 2-15 vol.% of hydrogen in order to maintain appropriate long-<br>
term catalyst activity and to prevent the formation of unsaturated products,<br>
especially in the case when esters and triglycerides are used as the starting<br>
material. Hydrogen is preferably added to the feedstock or to the reaction mixture.<br>
Catalyst<br>
The catalyst in the decarboxylation/decarbonylation reaction is a supported<br>
heterogeneous catalyst comprising at least one active elemental metal selected<br>
from the metals belonging to the Group VIII of the Periodic Table. Suitable<br>
metals are Pt, Pd, Ni, Ir, Ru and Rh and preferable ones are Pd and Pt, supported<br>
on oxides, mesoporous materials or carbonaceous supports, such as Al2O3, SiO2,<br>
Cr2O3, MgO, TiO2 or C. Preferably the support is activated carbon or other<br>
carbonaceous support or structured catalyst support. Structured catalyst supports,<br>
such as carbon fibres, carbon nanotubes attached to monoliths and carbon cloths<br>
are suitable support materials as well. Loading of the active metal varies in the<br>
range of 0.5 - 20 wt%, preferably 2-8 wt%. In the case nickel is used, the<br>
loading varies in the range of 2 - 55 wt%, preferably 10-30 wt%.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in batch, semi-batch or continuous mode of<br>
reaction, in reactors such as trickle-bed, continuous tubular or continuous stirred<br>
tank reactors in order to separate the gaseous CO2 and the light hydrocarbons<br>
extricated from esters and triglycerides of fatty acids. Thus the desired diesel<br>
fraction products, suitable for combustion in conventional engines, may be<br>
produced.<br><br>
The obtained product is a mixture of linear hydrocarbons, preferably linear<br>
paraffins boiling in the range of 180 - 350°C, the diesel fuel range, and having<br>
one carbon atom less than the original fatty acid chain.<br>
After the optional isomerization step a mixture of branched hydrocarbons is<br>
obtained, preferably branched paraffins boiling in the range of 180 - 3500C,<br>
having improved cold properties, such as low cloud point and pour point.<br>
The method according to the invention has several advantages. It provides a novel<br>
way for the selective manufacture of hydrocarbons, suitable for the use as diesel<br>
fuel or for the manufacture of diesel fuel, via decarboxylation/decarbonylation of<br>
a feedstock, particularly oxygenated feedstock, originating from renewable<br>
sources. The consumption of hydrogen in the method is low, the reaction<br>
temperature is sufficiently low when compared to thermal non-catalytic processes<br>
and thus no undesired decomposition of the feedstock was observed. Hydrogen,<br>
which is currently almost exclusively produced from fossil fuels, is only needed<br>
for the optional pre-treatment of the catalyst; however, it may be present also in<br>
the reactant stream in low concentrations. It is not consumed in side reactions or<br>
in direct reduction of carboxylic groups. Undesired side reactions, such as<br>
cracking, are negligible, as can be seen in the examples.<br>
Further, in the method according to the invention, the oxygenated feedstock, such<br>
as C8 - C24 fatty acids, as well as derivatives of said fatty acids, such as esters of<br>
said fatty acids, triglycerides of said fatty acids, or metal salts of said fatty acid<br>
are converted to the desired hydrocarbons with high selectivity. The hydrocarbon<br>
product has one carbon atom less than original fatty acid or fatty acid portion of<br>
its derivative. The structure of the obtained hydrocarbon product corresponds to<br>
the main chain of the starting material.<br><br>
No hazardous solvents are used in the method and neither hazardous waste is<br>
formed. Carbon dioxide released during the process originates from renewable<br>
sources and thus its production does not contribute on greenhouse effect.<br>
Conducting of the reaction in a liquid phase is preferential and brings several<br>
advantages over a gas phase reaction. A gas phase reaction requires high reaction<br>
temperature in order to vaporize feedstock, which causes decomposition of high-<br>
boiling compounds and supports endothermic side reactions as well as<br>
deactivation due to sintering and fouling. Maintaining of the reactants in liquid<br>
phase yields also more feasible process control.<br>
A hydrocarbon product suitable for the diesel fuel pool, with superioir properties<br>
can be obtained.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the following with examples presenting some<br>
preferable embodiments of the invention. However, it is evident to a man skilled<br>
in the art that the scope of the invention is not meant to be limited to these<br>
examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Decarboxylation of stearic acid<br>
Series of experiments were carried out in a Parr autoclave equipped with a heating<br>
mantle, stirrer, baffles and bubble-unit. 1 g of a catalyst, presented in table 1<br>
below, was placed into the autoclave and pre-treated under hydrogen flow at a<br>
temperature of 200 °C. After the pre-treatment, 85 g of dodecane (solvent) and<br>
4.5 g of stearic acid were fed into the reactor. The reaction temperature was kept<br>
at 300 °C, while passing helium gas through the reactor. The reactor pressure of<br>
0.8 MPa maintained the reactants and products in liquid phase with the exception<br><br>
of CO2, which was removed with helium gas acting as carrier gas, from the<br>
reactor. The conversions of stearic acid and the selectivities towards C17-products<br>
and the desired product, heptadecane (in brackets), after 90 minutes of the<br>
reaction with respect to catalyst used in the reaction are also listed in table 1.<br>
From the table 1 in can be seen that particularly preferable catalysts were Pd/C<br>
andPt/C.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Decarboxylation of stearic acid in the presence of a bimetallic catalyst<br>
In a procedure similar to the one presented in Example 1, a bimetallic catalyst,<br>
Pd(8 wt%)Pt(2 wt%)/C, was used. After 90 minutes of reaction 40 mol. % of<br>
stearic acid was converted with the selectivity of S3 mol. % towards<br>
n-heptadecane formation.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Decarboxylation of stearic acid in the presence of different gases<br>
In the reaction apparatus described in Example 1, a set of three experiments was<br>
performed. In all cases, 1 g of the catalyst (Pd(5 wt%)/C) was charged into the<br>
reactor, followed by its reduction under hydrogen flow at 200 °C. 45 g of stearic<br>
acid and 40 g of dodecane were subsequently fed into the reactor. During the<br>
reactions carried out at 300 °C, reactor pressure of 1.9 MPa was maintained by<br>
helium gas, a gas mixture of hydrogen (5 vol. %) and argon (95 vol. %), and<br>
hydrogen gas, respectively, in the individual experiments. The conversions of<br>
stearic acid and selectivities towards n-heptadecane are listed in the following<br>
table 2. From table 2 it can be seen that a mixture of hydrogen (5 vol. %) with an<br>
inert gas yields a high selectivity of n-heptadecane (93 mol%).<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Decarboxylation of ethyl stcarate<br>
In the reaction apparatus described in Example 1, another set of three experiments<br>
was run. In all cases, 1 g of the catalyst (Pd (5 wt%)/C) was charged into the<br>
reactor followed by its reduction under hydrogen flow at 200 °C. 50 g of ethyl<br>
stearate and 40 g of dodecane were subsequently fed into the reactor. During the<br>
reactions performed at 300 °C, 330 °C, and 360 °C reactor pressures of 1.9 MPa,<br><br>
2.3 MPa, and 2.9 MPa, respectively, were maintained by gas mixture comprising<br>
hydrogen (5 vol. %), and argon (95 vol. %). Please amend the pressure units in<br>
the table Conversions of ethyl stearate and selectivities towards C17-products and<br>
n-heptadecane (in brackets) are listed in the following table 3.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Decarboxylation of behemic acid and nonanoic acid<br>
In a procedure similar to the one in Example 3.54 g of behemic acid (purity 89 %)<br>
and 45 g of dodecane were placed into the reactor. The conversion of 45 % and<br>
selectivity of 90 mol.% towards n-heneicosane formation were achieved after six<br>
hours of reaction at 300 °C and under a reactor pressure of 1.9 MPa of hydrogen<br>
(5 vol. %) - argon (95 vol. %) gas mixture. Similarly, nonanoic acid was used as<br>
the reactant. The reaction proceeded with comparable yield of the decarboxylation<br>
product, octadecane.<br>
Example 6<br>
Decarboxylation of gryccrol tristcaratc<br>
In a procedure similar to the one in Example 3.47 g of glycerol tristearate and 45<br>
g of dodecane were charged into the reactor. During the reaction conducted at 360<br>
°C, reactor pressure of 4.2 MPa was maintained by a flow of a gas mixture<br>
comprising hydrogen (5 vol. %) - argon (95 vol.%). Only traces of glycerol<br><br>
tristearate (0.08 wt%) were identified in the liquid phase after six hours reaction<br>
time. According to GPC analysis the selectivity towards formation of C17 -<br>
hydrocarbons was at least 85 WT% based on conversion of glycerides. n-<br>
Heptadecane was the main product in the mixture of C17-hydrocarbon isomers.<br>
The selectivity towards cracking products was minor.<br>
Example 7<br>
Isomcrization of n-paraffins formed during decarboxylation/dccarbonylation<br>
Paraffinic feed, containing 94 wt-% of C15-C18 n-paraffins, was isomerized with<br>
an isomerization catalyst at 340 °C and 60 bar in a fixed bed reactor. Hydrogen<br>
was fed to the reactor 600 1/(1 oil feed). The isomerization catalyst was a<br>
platinum-based commercial catalyst. The product of isomerization contained 67<br>
wt-% of C15-C18 isoparaffins. The cloud point of the product was -12 °C,<br>
compared to 26 °C for the n-paraffin feed.<br>
Example 8.<br>
Decarboxylation of lauric acid in continuous mode<br>
The continuous decarboxylation of lauric acid was carried out in a fixed bed<br>
tubular reactor at 270 °C. 0.4 g of Pd(5%)/C catalyst was placed in the reactor and<br>
pretreated in a procedure described in example 1. The reaction pressure of 0,8<br>
MPa maintained reactant, products and solvent (dodecane) in liquid phase with<br>
the exception of CO2. The reaction mixture containing 5 mol% of lauric acid in<br>
solvent was continuously fed through the catalyst bed with the volumetric flow of<br>
0.1 ml/min. Lauric acid was completely converted with initial selectivity of 98<br>
mol % towards C11 products ( undecane selectivity of 92 mol%).<br><br>
