				<td>LEAKTIOGHT CONTAINER AND METHOD OF PACKAOING A LIQUID IN <br><br><br>
THIS COHTAIHBR<br>
The present invention relates to a leaktight container for packaging a liquid, including a sheet fixed to the internal face of a wall of the container by a leaktight connection surrounding a reclon of this sheet thus isolating it from the inside of the container, the breaking of this sheet in the said region thus isolated allowing access to the inside of tha container.<br>
Such leaktight containers with more or less solid flexible walls, pierced with an opening which is sealed by a membrane fixed against its internal face, and used for the packaging of liquid are already known. To access the inside of the container, all that is required is for the membrane to be pierced. In general, when the liquid is a drink., the membrane is pierced using a drinking straw which is then used for sucking up the liquid. When the container is a flexible-walled bag in particular, the pressure required te pierce the membrane is transmitted to the wall of the bag, thus temporarily increasing the pressure on its liquid contents at the moment it is being opened, this meaning that the pressurized liquid can come out of the bag.<br>
DE-A1-41 15 000 discloses a tubular bag in which the border parts adjacent to the longitudinal edges overlap, each of these edges being welded to the adjacent face. An opening is made in the border part of the underlying longitudinal edge, while a te-.b, which is offset with respect to the opening, is cut in the border part of the longitudinal edge covering this underlying part. A transverse weld extends between the two welded longitudinal edges. This tran.sverse weld passes between the opening and the tab/ so that a leaktight barrier isolates this opening from the cut out tab. To open the bag, it is merely necessary to pull on this tab so as to tear that portion of tha wall of the bag which covers the opening.<br>
'To access the opening, the transverse weld<br>
which separates the opening front the tab mt.st first of all be broken by pulling this tab. This breaking of this transverse weld requires substantial ail fort  It is also difficult to control. This means that there ie a risk of it either causing the tab to break, or of the longitudinal welds becoming torn, causing the bag tc fall apart. Independently of these risks, the leaktight overlap region ir. which the opening is located, situated between the longitudinal welds, the transverse weld and a weld sealing one end of the bag, ie in communication with the inside of the bag. This means that liquid can enter this region. As the bag is being opened, this liquid may run out over the external face of the bag and dirty it.<br>
Leaktight bags are also known which have a valve, at least part of which ie situated inside the bag and is formed between two flexible sheets passing through part of the bag and fixed in leaktight fashion between the edges of the bag. These sheets are joined together along two line* which do not converge so that by moving the said sheets away from on* another a passage is formed between these lines, allowing a fluid to pass from the inside to the outside of the bag, the flexible sheets being intended to be pressed on* against the other as soon as a force for parting them is no longer applied to them, thus preventing the said fluid from coming out of the bag.<br>
Such bags are known and have been described in WO 985/23742, in FR 2 711 115 or in FR 1 338 549 in particular.<br>
The valve of these leaktight bags ie normally formed by a passage which is open at both of its ends which means that it offers the user no guarantee regarding use of this bag prior to its purchase. Aside from the fact that the purchaser therefore has no guarantee that the bag still contains the initially packaged amount of product, neither does he have any guarantee regarding the conditions of hygiene of the product thus packaged.<br><br>
To overcome this drawback, it has been proposed to seal one of the ends of the passage using an attached cap, thus requiring another component to be added to the packaging.<br>
To work effectively, the passage forming the valve between the two flexible sheets has to be long enough to provide an effective seal. In the solutions proposed hitherto, the length of the passage has been . increased by forming a passage which ie at an angle to the major axis of the bag, which means that, the length of this passage is increased without a proportionate increase in the length of the flexible sheets extending into the bag. All the same,  the surfaces area oÂ£ flexible sheet used is substantially greater than the surface area occupied by the passage.<br>
In addition to optimum usage of  the sheet material forming the valve, one of the objects of the present invention is optimum usage of the volume of the bag. In bags of the state of the art, the top of the bag is left open to allow for filling. The fill level cannot be very high in auch cases otherwise the liquid overflows from the bag when the top edge is welded up. This means that the extent to which the liquid fills the bag is not very high. Of course it is possible to fill the bag through the passage of the valve, but liquid would remain in this passage, and this would not be acceptable as the passage has to remain perfectly clean until it is first used.<br>
 The object of the present invention is to overcome, at least in part, the aforementioned drawbacks.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a leaktight container including a sheet (2, 34) fixed to the internal face of a wall (1) of the container by a leaktight connection surrounding a region of this sheet thus isolating it from the inside uf the bag, the breaking of this sheet in the said region thus isolated forming an opening (16, 36) giving access to the inside of the container, characterized in that a tab (5) intended for opening the said container is formed in the portion of the said wall (1) of this container adjacent to the said region of the sheet (2, 34), one end (5a) of this tab (5) being free and acting as a means for holding, while another part (5b) of this tab (5) is fixed to the said sheet (2, 34).<br>
To this end, the subject of the present invention is a leaktight container in which a tab, intended for opening the said container, is formed in the portion of its wall adjacent to a region of the sheet fixed to the inside of the container, surrounded by a leaktight connection attaching this sheet to the wall of the container, one end of this tab being free and acting as a means for holding, while another part of this tab is fixed to the said sheet, thus allowing the said sheet to be broken by pulling on the tab and thus gaining access to the inside of the container.<br>
Another  subject  of  this  invention  is  a leaktight bag of the aforementioned type,-fitted with a valve. To this end, a second flexible sheeit is joined to the- first sheet, which is also flexible, along two connection  lines which do not  converge  extending between two distant parts of the joined-together edges of the walls cf the container to form a passage between these  sheets  in  the  part  extending  between  the connection lines/ at least one of the said sheets having a cut between the said nc-n-converging connection lines, some distance from the said leaktight connection between the said first sheet and the wall oÂ£ the container so as to make the said passage communicate with the inside of the container, the parts of these sheets situated between the said connection lines being intended to be pressed one against the other.- as soon as a force for parting them is no longer applied to them, thus preventing the said fluid from coming out of the container after an opening has been made in the said first sheet using the said tab.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a bag or a leaktight container of the aforementioned type, fitted with a valve, in which bag or container a second passage is formed between the said flexible sheets and has an outer end adjacent to one edge of the said bag and the other end in communication with the inside of this bag.<br>
Another subject of this invention is a method for packaging a liquid in a bag or container including the said second passage, according to which method the bag together with the' two passages ie^ formed, at least the outer end of the said second passage adjacent to the edge of the said bag is left open, the said liquid is introduced through this second passage and the sa'id outer end of the second passage is sealed.<br>
Among the many advantages of the container<br>
Vs" which forms the subject of the present invention, in<br>
the case of a valveless container, apart from the fact that it overcomes the risk of liquid under pressure leaking out as this container is being opened, the solution proposed does nor add any additional components to the leaktight container as compared with the known solutions, the tab being formed by a portion of the wall of the container. This solution therefore does not lead to an increase in production costs. Furthermore, existing production lines can continue to be used with only very slight modifications affording an advantage which is not inslgnifican: from the product standpoint.<br>
In the container with a valve, the valve is protected from any attempts at tampering. Hygienic conditions are perfectly guaranteed right up to the first time that the bag is used. The number of components forming the bag and the valve are reduced as far as possible, no attached element being needed to tamperproof the valve. The area of sheet, needed to produce the passage and the fillable volume cf the bag is optimized.<br>
Other advantages will emerge from reading the description which follows, given with the aid of the appended drawing which illustrates, diagrammatically and by way of example, one embodiment ,md various alternative forms of the leaktight container which forms the subject of this invention.<br>

Figure l illustrates four endless scrips i, 2, 3, 4 of monolayer or multilayer thermoplastic film, such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene or polyamide, which are used to manufacture the leaktight bag which is the subject of the invention. The strips 1 and 4, which are wider, are intended to form the walls of the bag, while the narrow strips 2 and 3 are used to produce the valve. As a preference, the thickness of the film of the strips 2 and 3, which is of the order of 40 jam, is less than that of the film of the scrips i and 4, which is of the order of 100 urn, so as to make the strips 2 and 3 more flexible, to make it: easier for the valve to close.<br>
The various operations in manufacturing this bag progress in line on the strips 1 to 4 and are illustrated by Figures 2 to 7 in which the widch of the bag is drawn in chain line.<br>
The first operation is carried out on the sheet 1 and consists in precutting tabs 5 at regular<br>
spacings. Each tab 5 is intended to be situated close to on* of the corners of the bag. The end of this tab 5 is cut out, while its parallel edges arc precut in such a way that before use the tab 5 remains in the plane of the sheet 1.<br>
The second operation (Fig. 3}, consists in depositing a rectangle 6 of heat-resistant ink or lacquer on the sheet 2, at regular spaeings, corresponding to the spacings between the tabs 5.<br>
The third operation consists in welding the sheets 2 and 3 along two parallel lines 7 and 8 (Fig. 4) , leaving a passage 10 between them, t:he flexible walls of which passage are normally touching, but can be moved apart, thus forming the valve which controls the dispensing of the packaged liquid. These welds 7 and 8 narrow at the point where the heat-resistant lacquer 6 is situated. During the same operation, two parallel cuts S are made in the welds 7 and 8, and a transverse cut 9a connects the. parallel cuts 9, thus placing the" passage 10 in communicatio:i with the outside.<br>
During the fourth operation (Fig. 5), the two strips 2 and 3 are welded to the strip 1 wi;h a weld 11 which extends along the outer edge .of the (strips 2 and 3 and near to the adjacent edge of the strip I. A weld 12 is also produced and this surrounds the long sides of the rectangle 6 of heat-resistant laequwr deposited on the sheet 2 and cuts across the wict.h of this rectangle Â£ so that the sheets 2 and 3 ar* not welded together at the location of the passage 10. A weld 13, in the shape of a rectangle, superimposed on the rectangle 6 of heat-resistant lacquer is a'.so produced so that only the sheets 1 and 2 are welded together at the location of this rectangle 13.<br>
Next, in the next stage, the strips 1, 2, 3 are covered with the fourth strip 4 and three welds 14a, 14b, I4c, forming three sides of the leaktight bag is are formed, one of them, 14b, along one of t:he edges of the strips 1 and 4, and the other two, Ida, i4c,<br>
transversely to these strips. The fourth side, adjacent to the other edge of the strips 1 and 4, remains open to allow subsequent filling of the leaktight; bag 15.<br>
The last step consists in detaching the leaktight bags from one another between two adjacent welds I4a, I4c.<br>
The leaktight bag 15 illustrated in Figure 7 is ready to receive the liquid to be packaged, after which the fourth side will be welded up, enclosing the liquid in a leaktight way.<br>
The contents of such a bag cannot be consumed straight from the hermetically-sealed bag after the bag illustrated in Figure 7 has been filled. This is because there is no opening giving access to the inside of the leaktight bag, which meang that -:his bag ie guaranteed tamperproof and any tampering can be verified, and that hygienic packaging conditions arÂ« ensured insofar as there is no opening giving access to the inside of the bag.<br>
Figures 10 to 12 show how it is possible to access the contents of the bag using a drinking straw or some eort of passage 17 allowing the licfuid to pass from the inside to the outside. All that is required is for the tab 5 to be lifted and pulled towards the edge 14C of the bag 15, Given that the tab 5 is welded along the weld rectangle 13 to the strip 2 which jiorms one of the walls of the passage 10, by pulling it, this wall 2 is torn thus making an opening 16 in the passage 10. This opening 16 allows a tubular element 17 such as a drinking straw or pouring device to be inserted. This tubular element 17 has to be long enough to emerge from the cut and 9a of the passage 10, thus placing the contents of the leaktight bag in communication with the outside.<br>
To interrupt this communication before all the liquid contained in the bag has been used up, all that is required is for the drinking straw 17 to be withdrawn so that its end becomes set back by a certain distance from the cut end 9a of the passage 10. AS a<br>
preference, as illustrated in Figures 7 and 12, the start of the passage 1C has a sudden vridening lOa intended to allow a folded-back end 17a of the drinking straw 17 to be housed and kept in place when one wishes to Stop consuming the liquid. The end of the widening lOa also forms a stop for the end 17a of the drinking straw 17, preventing this drinking straw from being pushed so far into the passage 10 that it. would open the valve formed by this passage 10. As can be seen in Figures 10 to 12, the edge of the tab 5 attached to the wall l of the leaktight bag 15 is adjacent to the weld 14c, which means that this weld limits the amount by which the tab S can be pulled back.<br>
The alternative form illustrated by Figures 13 to 15 consists in adding to that part of the bag 15 which is fitted with the valve, a strip of a more rigid material, such as a strip of thicker material (of the order of 200-250 Âµm) 18, such as a thermoplastic film of the same type as that used for the sheets 1 to 4. This strip 18 has parallel score lines IS which are obtained by compression. This strip 18 is ::ixed to the bag by welding it to the tab 5, itself welded around the rectangle 13 to the sheet 2, as illustrated in Figures 5 to 7.<br>
By pulling on the strip 18, the tab 5 is pulled and the wall of the passage 1C is torn, thus opening the valve. The strip 18 is then detached from the tab 5 the weld between this strip 18 and this tab being chosen to offer lower resistance to pulling than the weld 13 between the tab 5 and the sheet 2. Once the strip 18 has been detached, it' is bent along the score lines 19 to form a pipe which acts either an a drinking straw or as a pouring spout depending on the shape it has, and it is inserted into the opening IS ae before (Figure 15).<br>
The alternative form illustrated by Figures 16 to 19 shows, in addition to the passage 1C which acts as a valve and as a pipe for dispensing the liquid packaged in the bag, a passage 20 intended only for<br>
filling the bag.<br>
The  operations  in  manufacturing  the  bag according to this alternative form arc the same aa those described, in respect, of the previous embodiment, which means that these operations will be described more briefly for this alternative form.<br>
As before, the opening tab 5 ie presut in the sheet 1 used to form one of the walls of the bag. In parallel, a layer of sparing lacquer 6 is deposited on one 2 of the sheets, the one intended ;o form the valve. Ae ie visible in Figures 16 to 19, rhe layer of sparing lacquer 6 also extends over some Sa of the width of the weld 14a forming the perimeter of the bag, and over a certain length of this weld 14a, for the reason which will be explained later.<br>
Next, the sheets 2 and 3 are weldÂ«td Â».long the line 7, 8 to form the passage 10, and the cut 9 is made to place this passage in communication with the inside of the bag. As far as the passage 20 is concerned, it is formed between the weld 8 and a weld 21 which extends along the inner edge of the sheets i and 2.<br>
Once the passages 10 and 20 have been formed, the sheets 2 and 3 are joined to the sheet 1 ueing a weld 22 (Pig. 17) which has an opening 22a superimposed with the head 5a of the tab 5. This weld, as before, join* the rest of the tab 5 to the wall 1 of the bag, the sparing lacquer 6 preventing the two wfills 2 and 3 from being welded together at the location of the passage 10 between them.<br>
At this stage (Fig. 18} the tsheet 4 is superimposed on the sheets 1, 2 and 3 and they are welded edge to edge to form the leaktighc bag. During this operation, it is contrived for the welding of the edge of the bag to be superimposed with the region 6s covered with sparing lacquer, which has the effect of leaving this part of the bag open.<br>
The next operation consists in inserting a folded drinking straw 17 into the passage 10 and in inserting a filling lance 23 into the pass.ige 20. Once<br>
filling is over, the ende of the passages 10 and 20 are sealed by welding the edge of the bag in -:hat pare of the width which has been left free by the sparing lacquer 6a as illustrated in Figure 19.<br>
This bag can then be used like the bag described earlier, by tearing back the tab 5 giving access to the drinking straw 17 and to the dispensing passage 10.<br>
Of course, it is also possible not to place a drinking straw in the passage 10, in which case the outer edge of this passage may be sealed when the edge oi the bag is welded up and only that end cf the second passage 20 which is adjacent to this edge left open.<br>
All the embodiments described hitherto relate to bags with valves. Now, it would seem tha. the use of a tab also offers 5 great advantage for containers for packaging liquid which are sealed by a cap welded or bonded around an opening formed through the internal wall of the container.<br>
The leaktight container illustrated by Figures 20 to 23 is shown empty and includes two eheets 1, 32 of monolayer or multilayer plastic such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene or polyamide, coming from two endless stripe of the order of 100 Âµm thick, welded edge to edge along their entire periphery "3, then cut transversely in the direction of travel of the strips once the container is finished. A strip 34 mad* of a material of the same type, but which is preferably thinner, for example of the order of 40 Âµm is arranged between the sheets 1 and 32 and is fixed against the inner face of the sheet 1. This sheet 1 has a precut tab 5, a free end 5a of which constitutes an element for holding on to this tab 5, while tha body Sb of this tab ie welded to the strip 34.<br>
By grasping hold of this end 5a, to pull the tab 5 away from the strip l from which it is cut, the body 5b which is welded to the strip 34 tears this strip as illustrated by Figures 21 and 23, leaving an opening 36 which gives access to the inside of the<br>
container and therefore allows the liquid packaged therein to be got out. When this liquid is; a drink, a drinking straw may be inserted through the opening 36 and the liquid sucked out. When it is an ecologically-friendly refill, for example, the contents may be poured out of the container.<br>
Although the essential advantage of the present invention is associated with flexible-walled leaktight containers of the bag type, the invention could also be applied to other types of leaktight containers for packaging liquid. Of course the invention is not in any way limited to the fact that the membrane fixed against the inner face of the wall of the container consists of a etrip passing across the length or w:i.dth of the container, the use of a scrip of this type is advantageous because it allows the container according to the invention to be produced continuously from materials in strip form. The entire surface area of the strip 34 need not necessarily be welded to the inner face of the wall 1 of the bag. In actual fact, all that is required is for it to be welded to the body 5b of the tab, and for the unwelded portion of ::he membrane 34 adjacent to the holding end 5a of the tab 5 to be isolated from the inside of the bag by a leaktight connection so as to prevent the liquid being able to get out until that part of the membrane 34 which is welded to the body 5b of the tab 5 has been torn.<br>
Figures 24 and 25 illustrate not only an alternative forns of the method of Figures I to 7, but also an alternative form of the valve formed between the sheets 2 and 3 arranged between the sheets 1 and 4 forming the bag. In this alternative form, the sheet 1 hae not b-aen represented, but it is of course there.<br>
The first operation carried out in Figure 24 is illustrated by section a-a of Figure 25 and corresponds to the weld 7', 8' delimiting the passage 10' of the valve. AB may be seen, this passage does not have parallel edges, and the purposes and functions of the variations in cross-section thus given to the passage<br>
10 will be explained later. A transverse weld 42 is formed close to one end of the passage 10' the utility of this weld will be explained later.<br>
The next operation consists in making the cut 9', 9'a intended to make this passage 1C' communicate with the outside. This cut 9' has the shape of a U, the two arms of which are of unequal length, As can be sÂ«Â«n, this lack of symmetry of the arms of the U-shaped cut 9' coincides with the lack of symmetry of the narrowing at the middle of the passage 10' . This lack of symmetry of the passage 10' and of ths cut 9' has been shown tc improve the sealing of the valve, that is to say of that part of the passage 10' which extends from the asymmetric narrowing of this passage and the cut S' , 9 a.<br>
During the operation illustrated by the next section c-c. a drinking straw 17' is inserted into the passage 10' . The diameter of this drinking straw is such that it corresponds substantially to the narrowing formed at the entry of the passage 10'. This means that the drinking straw seals against the inlet end of the passage 10', which means that liquid which may have flowed between the passage 10' and the dr.-.nking straw 17' during the opening of the valve is prevented from leaving this passage 10'. It may also be noued that the end of the drinking straw 17' inserted into the passage 10' has a bulge 17'a which prevents the dr:.nking straw 17' from coming out of the passage 10' , this bulge resting against the narrowing situated at the entry to the passage 10' . Furthermore, the transverse weld 42 limits the movement of the drinking straw 17' in the passage 10'.<br>
The operation illustrated by section d-d is<br>
carried out in parallel on the sheet 4 forming one of<br>
the walls of the bag. It consists in cutting out the<br>
tab 5.	. "<br>
Between the operation (c-c) of inserting the drinking straw 17' , and the next operation d-d, the sheet 4 doine the other two sheets 2, 3 and a non-<br>
wcldable sheet (not represented) is inserted between the drinking straw and the sheet 3 adjacent te the sheet 4. This means that the weld 40 made in operation e-e welds together only the sheets 3 and 4 and the opening 40a leaves the end 5a of the tab 5 free, the rest of this tab being welded to the sheet 4.<br>
The last operation consists in making two epot welds 41 between the welds 7, 8' forming the passage 10' and the wall 4 of the bag as well as two parallel weld lines 43, the spacing of which corresponds to that of the welds T , e1 of the passage 10'. These welde 43 attach the valve formed by the passage 10' to the opposite edge of the sheets 2, 3 and 4. It 43 thus delimit [sic] the width of the housing acconmodating the folded-ovar part of the drinking straw 17'. Ae for the spot welds 41, they prevent the sheets 2, 3 from following the drinking straw 17' when the bulge 17'a is brought up against the narrowing situated tit the entry to the passage 10', allowing the valve to close.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	Leaktight container fitted with a valve which lies inside this container and<br>
is formed   between two flexible sheets (2, 3) extending from one edge of the<br>
container to  the  other  and joined  together  along  two  non-converging<br>
connection lines (7,  8) so that when the said flexible sheets (2, 3) are<br>
parted, a passage (10) is delimited between them, wherein the two non-<br>
converging connection lines (7, 8) extend from one edge of the container to<br>
the other, a portion of one (2) of the said sheets, which lies between the two<br>
non-converging connection lines (7, 8) being fixed to a tab (5) cut in the<br>
adjacent wall (1) of the container and attached to this wall by one end,<br>
whereas the other end is free so as to form a means from grasping, a<br>
leaktight connection between the sheet (2) and the adjacent wall (1) of the<br>
container extending right around the periphery of the said tab (5), this tab<br>
being used to break the portion of the said sheet (2) which is fixed to it, by<br>
pulling  on  its  free   end,   in  order  to   place   the   said  passage   (10)   in<br>
communication with the outside, a cut (9a) being made through at least<br>
one of the said sheets (2, 3) between the said non-converging connection<br>
lines (7, 8) , this cut being distant from that portion of the sheet (5) which<br>
is   fixed   to   the   tab   (5)   and   serving   to   place   the   said   passage   in<br>
communication with the inside of the said container.<br>
2.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the part of the said tab<br>
(5) attached to the wall (1) of the container is adjacent to a weld (14c, 33)<br>
joining together two walls (1, 4; 1, 34) of this container.<br>
3.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the passage (10) formed<br>
by the said connection lines (7, 8) has a widened part adjacent to the end of<br>
the passage, a wall portion of which is integral with the said tab (5).<br>
4.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the walls <br>
(1.a) of the computor rem a strsp (18)of a moturdelsttached to<br>
which is more rigid than the walls (1, 4) of the containerand rendered integral with <br>
The outer face of the  said tab (5) to allow the said passage (10) to be opened when this strip (18) is detached from the said container.<br>
5.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 4, wherein the said strip (18) of<br>
material has score lines (19) arranged so that after folding it forms a pipe<br>
which can be inserted into the said passage (10) to open the valve and allow<br>
the liquid contained in the said container to pass through.<br>
6.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said non-converging<br>
connection lines (7,  8)  extend parallel to one edge of the bag, joining<br>
together two opposite edges (14a, 14c).<br>
7.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 1, wherein a second passage (20) is<br>
formed between  the  said flexible sheets (2,  3)  and has an  outer end<br>
adjacent   to   one   edge   of  the   said   container   and   the   other   end   in<br>
communication with the inside of this container.<br>
8.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 7, wherein two of the respective<br>
ends of the  said passages	20)  coincide with one edge of the said<br>
container and are adjacent to one another.<br>
9.	Leaktight container as claimed in claim 3, wherein the cross-section of<br>
the said passage (10')     close to its opposite end to the said cut (9'a) has a<br>
