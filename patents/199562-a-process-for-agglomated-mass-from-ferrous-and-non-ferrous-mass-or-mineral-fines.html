				<td>A PROCESS FOR COLD BRIQUETTING AND PELLETISATION OF IRON ORES AND MINERAL FINES FOR METALLURGICAL APPLICATIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for cold briquetting and pelletisation of ferrous or non-ferrous ores or mineral fines by iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder for metallurgical application.<br>
Background Art<br>
Agglomerated products such as briquettes, pellets and blocks made from fine derivatives of oxides and metals of iron, limestone, dolomite, dunite, solid carbon etc. by iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder will find suitable application as a feed material in blast furnace for extraction of iron, in rotary and shaft kiln for reduction and oxidising roasting and sintering, in tunnel, chamber and moving grate type of furnaces for calcinations, roasting and sintering.<br>
Agglomeration methods of briquetting and pelletisation are quite well-known for converting fines and powdery derivatives of ores, minerals, residue and solid wastes into lumpy sizes for various industrial use. This is a common practice in iron and steel industries for use of Fe-containing fine materials in the metallurgical furnaces. Many process developments have been made for production of briquettes and pellets from various metallurgical fines by hot and cold methods. Depending on the nature of fines, oil contamination, mineral association and Fe-structural phases, both hot and cold processes have been developed to make briquettes and pellets.<br>

Some of the processes also describes sintering of cold bonded briquettes and pellets at 1200°C temperature for blast furnace use. Some of the process further describes use of oil contaminated iron-sludge by heating for de-oiling and hot briquetting.<br>
The drawbacks of the earlier processes are the use of wide varieties of binding materials, steam curing, heat hardening, sintering and hot compaction under pressure in making briquettes and pellets which are energy intensive. Most of the organic and inorganic binders dissociate at low temperature (below 600°C) and easily soluble in water for which the briquettes and pellets made out of these binders give unsatisfactory performance in respect to durability, resistance to moisture, volume stab; v and thermal stability. In addition, the use of sulphate, alkali. ioride. phosphate bearing binding materials results in poor sinterability and reducibility of briquettes and pellets. These types of binders also add deleterious impurities in the metallurgical process and create emission of hazardous and corrosive gases which<br>
cause destruction of furnace life and air pollution. Thus there exists a need to provide a process that overcomes the aforesaid limitations.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for cold briquetting and pelletisation of ferrous or non-ferrous ores or mineral fines by iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder for metallurgical application which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a briquetting and pelletisation process that eliminates energy intensive processes such as heat hardening, steam curing, thermal treatment, hot pressing.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a briquetting and pelletisation process that replaces the use of costly and multiple varieties of binding materials    constituting    undesirable    constituents    deleterious    for    metallurgical<br>
operations.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a briquetting and pelletisation process that produces briquettes and pellets having improved chemical, physical, thermal and volume stability properties and that gives better metallurgical performance.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to provide a briquetting and pelletisation process that uses a wide variety of raw materials to make briquette, pellet, microgranule and block suitable for application in metallurgical and high temperature furnaces.<br>
One another object of the present invention is to provide a briquetting and pelletisation process that uses of all kinds of minerals including Fe-oxide and carbon bearing materials as such or in composite mixtures to make briquette, pellet, microgranule and block suitable for application in metallurgical and high temperature furnaces.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to make the briquetting and pelletisation<br>
process energy efficient, pollution free and cost effective.<br>

Iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder, surface active agent and water are the ingredients mixed with different kinds of metallurgical and mineral fines in formulation of mixtures for manufacture of blocks, briquettes, pellets and micro-granules. The iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder is a powdery material of fineness of particles passing at least 90% by 170 mesh BSS sieve and having minimum surface area 300M2/kg (Blaine) like Portland cement. The binder hydrates in presence of vvater and develops binding strength. The surface active agent is in form of liquid which acts for easy dispersion of binder and improves the binding effect on oily and carbonaceous particles. Depending on the type of iron bearing phases, content of other mineral matter, solid carbon, content of oil and moisture, the ingredients are mixed to make homogenised mixtures in dry or semi wet state. According to the use of the mixture for briquetting and pelletisation, the addition of water is made. Nonnally briquetting mixtures are made in wet form where water is added during the mixing. In ase of granulation for pellet making, dry mixture is used with addition of water during the pelletisation. In specific cases, the surface active agent is also used along with water. Triethanolamine is the surface active agent and it is used along with water (5  ml/L of water as minimum dose) depending on the binder content for easy<br>
dispersion and improvement in binding property of the binder on oily surface particles. Based on the mixture composition and content of iron bearing mineral binder, the addition of water is made accordingly to maintain the ratio between 0.2 to 1.8 of W/B (Water : Binder) for uniform hydration of the binder in making briquette, pellet or micro-granules. The fines ranging in size up to 10 mm and up to 2 mm are the granulometric fractions in making block or briquette and pellet or micro-granulation mixtures respectively. In case of briquetting, the mixture of fed to the rolling or compaction type or press devices or machines to make briquettes and blocks. Based on the composition and type of fine derivatives and particle size of the mixed material, the compaction load or pressure 0.5 to 5 tonne is applied for manufacture of briquetted or block shape products. The binder content in the mixture for briquette and block making is 3 to 10% on weight basis. Higher percentage of binder is also usable depending the application of final product. Dry or semi wet mixture consisting of particle size up to 2 mm is fed to the drum or disc granulator devices for manufacture of ball like pellet or microgranulated particles by adding required quantity of water. Balling time of the mixture is 5 to 10 minutes for manufacture of 8 to 20 mm diameter pellet and microgranules of less than 8 mm sizes. Manufacture of these agglomerated products of briquettes, blocks and pellets from wet mixture is preferably within 5 hours from the time of contact of water with the binder to avoid the effect of false setting and drying.<br>
The green briquettes, blocks and palletized products are kept exposed in atmosphere for 12 hours and then at every 12 hours interval, moisture is sprayed for curing and to develop cold strength. The briquette, block and pellet gradually attain strength' with time and water curing. Hydration strength of the binder is a gradual process with time and on 20th day the product attains almost 95% of strength. But in 3 to 7 days of time about 50 to 70% of the total strength attains in the product. Depending on the type of iron bearing metallurgical derivatives, mineral fines, particle size, binder content of 3 to 10% and compaction load of 0.5 to 5 tonne, the cold strength of the briquetted and block shaped products attain 10 to 40 MPa on 20th day. Green strength of briquetted and block shape products in presence of the binder immediately after casting retains 20-30 kg/cm" as compressive strength to sustain 3 to 4 drops from 1 M heinght on a steel plate which bears sufficient green strength for easy transportation through conveyor belt or any other means of transportation for further curing. Figure<br>
If a), (b). (c) and (d) illustrates the effect of compaction load and percentage of iron bearing mineral binder on cold crushing strength of cylindrical shaped briquettes consisting of iron oxide particles (-6.3 mm size) after 1. 3. 7 and 20 days of curing in water In case of pellet made by balling in disc or drum granulators, the crushing strength on 20th day of curing in water attains 4 to 18 MPa in the presence of 6 to 18% of binder. Figure 2 illustrates the crushing strength of iron oxide pellets (8 to 12 mm i n diameter) in presence of iron bearing mineral binder on 20th day of curing in water. Depending upon the chemistry of the feed material for metallurgical application. higher strength in the briquette and palletised product is achievable using higher percentage of binder.<br>
Iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder plays a significant role to develop the cold strength by hydration in the agglomerated product. Chemical constituents of the binder vary from 25 to 45% of Fe203, 40 to 60% of CaO+MgO and 12 to 18% of SiCh'AbCh. Mineralogically, these oxides of the binder exists in different solid-soiution structures of CaO-Fe2O3, CaO-Al2O3-Fe2O3, CaO-Fe2O3-MgO-SiO2 and CaO-SiO? which on hydration impart binding property. The binder is an ultrafine powdery material consisting of these iron bearing mineral phases. The binder itself on casting (cube) using a paste mixture of proper water content attains the strength on hydration in the order of 70 to 85 MPa. But the same paste casting under compaction pressure, the hydration strength increases 20 to 30% more than the normal strength, figure 3 illustrates the performance of the iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder on strength at normal casting (CCP 0) and casting under compaction pressure (CCP) of 1, 2, 3 tonne. At elevated temperature the casted cube of the binder shows a marginal loss of hydration strength within 800°C due to the loss of structural water. The strength of binder significantly increases above 800°C temperature due to the binding of the precipitated oxide phases. Figure 4 illustrates the typical phenomena in loss and gain of strength in the casted cubes of iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder at elevated temperature. Similar phenomena of loss and gain of strength of the binder at elevated temperature prevails in the agglomerated products. The binder adds beneficial constituents of iron and lime valuthe product suitable for metallurgical use and also retains high strength up to 600°C and above 800°C temperature, volume stability and thermal stability in the agglomerated product. Figure 5 illustrates the strength at elevated temperature of iron oxide briquettes consisting of 4-10% binder.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the trend in retention of strength of iron oxide briquettes under reducing atmosphere at elevated temperature. Figure 7 illustrates the trend in retention of strength of iron oxide pellets under reducing atmosphere at elevated temperature. Formation of hydrated precipitates of iron and lime bearing structures of the binder not only provide binding strength but also act as promoter in early sintering and reduction reactions of Fe-oxide particles in the agglomerated products. Figure 8 photomicrograph illustrates the bonding mechanism of Fe-oxide particles by the binder phase in a agglomerated product after oxidising heating at 1050°C temperature. The binder primarily forms calcium-ferrite structures on heating which imparts strength to the agglomerated particles. Figure 9 photomicrograph illustrates the extent .'i reduction of Fe-oxides to Fe-metal after treating of the agglomerated product in a confined coke chamber at 1050°C for 1 hour duration.<br>
The retention of high strength at atmospheric condition and at elevated temperature, volume and thermal stability, resistant to moisture and humidity, promoting in faster sintering and reduction of Fe-oxide phases and free in emission of corrosive gases at elevated temperature and impurities are some special features of the present process in manufacture of cold briquettes and pellets of ferrous and non-ferrous mineral fines suitable for metallurgical and other applications.<br>
The invention of the present process has been established by conducting series of laboratory scale experiments to produce briquette, block and pellet shaped agglomerates from different combinations of Fe-bearing oxides, metals and other mineral fines such as iron ore, blast furnace dust and sludge, basic oxygen furnace (BOF) dust and sludge, mill scale and oil and carbon contaminated sludge and fines, lime, limestone, dolomite, dunite, quartzite, coke and carbonaceous materials using the iron bearing hydraulic mineral binder. The agglomerated products have been examined to evaluate the physical, metallurgical and high temperature properties for various applications.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
Iron ore (-6.3 mm size) 3.600 kg, iron rich mineral binder 0.400 kg (10% ore basis) and 0.130 litre water [water to binder (W/B) ratio 0.32] are altogether mixed in a<br>
drum mixture for 5 minutes. Green mixture of 2 kg each is then used to make cylindrical briquettes of 30 mm diameter under 0.5 tonne and 5 tonne compression load.

The examples illustrate that particle size, content of binder, range of compaction load and compaction factor in case of briquettes and blocks, granulation time in case of pellet, water and binder ratio etc. are some variable factors in making cold briquettes, pellets and microgranules. Cold strength of the agglomerated product gradually increases with time. But in consideration to time and productivity, 3 to 7 days of water curing is ideal in commercial production. Depending on the purpose, type of material and limitation of chemical composition, the minimum requirement of binder is a decisive factor on the basis of application of the agglomerated products.<br>
