				<td>This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application number 60/107,992 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The field of the invention is recovery of gases from the offgas in a pressure swing adsorption unit in hydrogen production.<br>
Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a well known process for recovering light gases from mixtures which also contain heavier, more readily adsorbable components, and the recovery of hydrogen from steam-methane syngas containing hydrogen, carbon oxides, and methane is a particularly well suited application of the PSA process.<br>
A typical PSA process and apparatus is described in U.S.Pat. No. 3,430,418 to Wagner and in U.S.Pat. No. 3,986,849 to Fuderer, both of which arc incorporated by reference herein. With an increasing demand of highly purified gases, various improvements were developed to help overcome limitations in the original process with respect to flow rates, capacity, and yield. For example, Fuderer describes in U.S.Pat. No. 4,333,744 an increase in yield employing a particular PSA loading pattern in which a first portion of a feed stream is pretreated to remove substantial amounts of an unwanted component, and a second portion is loaded in an untreated form. Although the Fuderer's methods may increase the overall amount of purified gas and may advantageously increase the flow rate, the offgas is eventually directed to a waste line, or into a reformer burner, and components of interest in the offgas are concomitantly lost.<br>
To avoid concomitant losses of desirable components in the offgas stream, various recovery methods were developed. One method of recovering desirable components employs membranes that either concentrate or filtrate hydrogen in the offgas stream. For example, G. Intille describes in U.S.Pat .No. 4,229,188 the use of hydrogen-permeable membranes to recover H2 from the offgas. Intille's membranes advantageously remove H2 with high selectivity in a single process step, however, the use of such membranes typically requires relatively high pressure, thereby increasing the overall energy demand. To avoid at least some of the problems<br>
-   1A   -<br><br>
	PCT/IB99/01808<br>
associated with hydrogen-permeable membranes, Anand et al. teach in U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,836 the use of an adsorbent membrane. Adsorbent membranes generally allow hydrogen recovery at comparably low pressure with relatively high specificity. The advantage of relatively low pressure, however, tends to be offset by the need of membrane exchange, thereby either increasing the complexity of the hydrogen plant, or necessitating discontinuous operation.<br>
Another method utilizes a serial configuration of PSA units, wherein a first PSA unit has a different selectivity from a second PSA unit, and wherein the offgas from the first unit is directed to the feed end of the second PSA unit. An example for this configuration is described by R. Kumar in U.S.Pat. No. 4,913,709. Kumar's serial configuration of PSA units with beds having non-identical adsorption specificity is favorable because relatively high volumes of offgas may be purified at a time. However, the complexity and number of coordinated cycle steps generally increases due to the different physico-chemical properties of the adsorbent beds .<br>
In still another method, U.S.Pat No. 4,553,981 to Fuderer, the feed gas of a PSA unit is<br>
pretreated to remove a second component at least in part, while the PSA/unit purifies a first<br>
component. A first portion of the offgas of the PSA unit is recycled into the same PSA unit, and a second portion of the offgas is directed to a waste line. Alternatively, a first portion of the offgas is directed to a second PSA unit having the same specificity, and the offgas of the second PSA unit is fed to a waste line. By removing the second component from the feed gas before the feed gas enters the PSA unit, the offgas will typically have a higher relative purity, and a remaining portion of the first component may therefore be easier to extract. However, the second component in Fuderer's configuration typically needs to be further purified.<br>
Although various improvements have been developed to increase the recovery rate of desirable components in the offgas from PSA units, all or almost all of them have one or more than one disadvantage. Thus, there is a need to provide methods and apparatus for increased recovery of desirable components in the offgas from a PSA unit.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a gas separation apparatus that has a first pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit receiving a feed gas comprising a first and a second component. The first PSA unit produces a first product gas predominantly comprising the first component, and a first offgas comprising at least some of the first component and the second component. A<br>

WO 00/27505	PCT/IB99/0I808<br>
compressor is coupled to the first PSA unit and compresses the offgas to form a compressed offgas, and an absorber unit downstream of the compressor employs a solvent to remove at least pan of the second component from the compressed offgas, thereby forming an enriched compressed offgas, A second PSA unit receives !he enriched compressed offgas and produces a second product gas predominantly comprising the first component, and a second offgas. The gas separation apparatus may further comprise a flash unit and a gas liquefaction unit, which is preferably an autorefrtgeration system.<br>
In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, the feed gas is an effluent gas stream from a steam reformer and/or shift converter, and preferably comprises H2 and CO3 in excess over CO, CH4. and other gaseous products. The first and second PSA units are preferably hydrogen PSA units, and while the offgas from the first PSA unit is used to recover first and second components, the offgas from the second PSA is preferably routed to a reformer burner.<br>
In another aspect of the inventive subject matter, a method of recovering a first and a second component from an offgas of a PSA unit includes a first step in which the offgas is compressed to produce a compressed offgas steam, in a next step at least some of the second component is recovered from the compressed offgas stream to produce an enriched compressed offgas stream. The enriched compressed offgas stream is passed to a second PSA unit to recover at least some of the first component.<br>

Fig. 3 is a flow diagram of a method of recovering a first and a second component from an offgas of a PSA unit according to the present inventive subject matter.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
As used herein, the term "absorber unit" refers to a device other than a PSA unit in which at least one component of a gas mixture is absorbed from the gas mixture using an absorbent. Contemplated absorbents comprise liquids, and especially contemplated absorbents include CO2 absorbing liquids such as Selexol(tm) or Fluor Solvent(tm) (Propyiene carbonate).<br>
As also used herein, the term "autorefrigeration system" refers to a device that produces high purity liquid CO2 using CO2 as a refrigerant. An especially contemplated autorefrigeration system is described in PCT application PCT/US99/00087 to S. Rcddy, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As further used herein the term "hydrogen PSA unit" refers to a PSA unit that is configured to produce a product gas stream predominantly comprising hydrogen. Similarly, a "CO2 PSA unit" is a PSA unit that is configured to produce a product gas stream predominantly comprising carbon dioxide. The term "predominantly comprising" means that the product gas stream comprises at least 50% of the carbon dioxide, hydrogen, or other compound that is predominantly present in a product.<br>
In Figure 1, a hydrogen production plant 100 generally comprises a first PSA unit 110 that receives feed gas 112 comprising a first and a second component from a gas source 108. The first PSA unit 110 produces product gas 114, predominantly comprising the first component, and the offgas comprising at least some of the first and second component from the first PSA unit is directed to a compressor 120 via the offgas line 116. The compressed offgas from the compressor is directed via a compressed offgas line 126 to an absorber unit 130, which stands via solvent lines 131A and 13IB in fluid communication with a flash unit 132. The flash unit releases concentrated gaseous CO2 product 133, which may optionally be directed to a reform burner 150 via line 152. Alternatively, gaseous CO2 may be directed to a liquefaction unit 134A via CO2 line 137. The hydrogen enriched compressed offgas from the absorber unit 130 is directed to a second PSA unit 140 via enriched compressed offgas line 136B. The second PSA<br>
-   4   -<br><br>
WO 00/27505	PCT/IB99/01808<br>
unit 140 produces product gas 142, and the offgas is directed to a waste stream via offgas line 146A, or to a reformer burner 150 via offgas line 146B.<br>
in a preferred embodiment the gas source 108 is a steam reformer that produces the feed gas 112, which predominantly comprises H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. The first PSA unit 110 is a hydrogen specific PSA unit with 8 adsorption beds, and a H2 production capacity of about 100000 Nm3/hr at operating pressures between 250 and 500psig. The product gas 114 produced by the first PSA unit is hydrogen. Compressor 120 is a centrifugal-type compressor compressing the offgas containing H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 from the first PSA unit to approximately 300-500psig. The absorber 130 is a packed bed-type absorber utilizing solvent absorption with Fluor Solvent(tm) to absorb CO2 from the compressed offgas, thereby producing a CO2-rich solvent and a hydrogen enriched compressed offgas. The solvent containing the absorbed CO2 is transferred to a flash unit and the concentrated CO2 product 133 is recovered by letting the CO2-rich solvent down in about 0-50psia. The regenerated solvent is subsequently recycled to the absorber 130. Liquefaction unit 134A is an autorefrigeration system that receives and liquefies CO2 from the flash unit. The hydrogen enriched compressed offgas is directed via enriched compressed offgas line 136B to a second PSA unit 140, which is identical in selectivity with the first PSA unit. The second PSA unit produces H3 as a product gas 142. The offgas from the second PSA unit is directed via offgas line 146B to a reformer burner, or via offgas line 146A to a waste. All lines are conventional pressure resistant lines and are well known in the art.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the gas source 108 need not be limited to a steam reformer, but may vary depending on the particular method of hydrogen production. Therefore, where relatively high levels of CO are present, a shift converter may be included. In other aspects, the gas source may comprise alternative hydrogen sources, including sources performing partial oxidation of various hydrocarbons, or coal gasification. It should also be appreciated that the gas source may comprise elements that are employed in gas purification rather than production. Thus, purification apparatus including PSA units, absorber units, etc. are also contemplated. In still other aspects, the gas source need not be limited to a source producing predominantly hydrogen, but may also include sources producing N2, He, Ar, etc.<br>
Consequently, the feed gas 112 need not be restricted to a gas mixture predominantly comprising H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. Alternative feed gases are contemplated to include gas mixtures comprising C2-C6 hydrocarbons, and higher, which may or may not be aliphatic, inert<br>
-   5   -<br><br>
WO 00/27505	PCT/IB99/01808<br>
gases such as N2, He, Ar, or pre-treated gas mixtures that have been enriched with, or depleted of one or more compounds. For example, a gas mixture from a steam reformer may be pre-treated with an absorbent to remove CO2.<br>
With respect to the first PSA unit 110 it is contemplated that, although a hydrogen specific PSA unit with 8 adsorption beds, and a H2 production capacity of 100000 Nm3/hr at operating pressures between 250 and 500psig is preferred, various other PSA units may also be utilized. There are various PSA units known in the art and contemplated appropriate herein, so long as alternative PSA units produce a PSA specific product gas, and an offgas comprising at least two gaseous components. Therefore, product gas ! !4 need not necessarily be hydrogen, but - depending on the specificity of alternative PSA units - may also be other gases, including CO2, CH4, N2. CO, etc.<br>
Compressor 120 is preferably a centrifugal-type compressor, however, various other types of compressors are also contemplated, so long as alternative compressors are capable of compressing the offgas from the first PSA unit to a level that allows the absorption of at least one component with a solvent in a subsequent absorber unit. Therefore, contemplated compressors may include screw-type compressor, or a reciprocating compressor. With respect to the compression of the offgas of the first PSA unit, it is contemplated that appropriate compressors produce pressures of less than 50 psig, 50-200psig, 200-400psig, 400-600psig, and more than 600psig.<br>
In further alternative embodiments absorber 130 need not be limited to a packed bed-type absorber utilizing solvent absorption with Fluor Solvent(tm) to absorb CO2, and various alternative absorber types are also contemplated, including a trayed-type absorber. Likewise, the solvent may be different from the Fluor Solvent(tm), so long as the solvent is sufficiently specific to a desired gaseous component. For example, where CO2 is the desired gaseous component, Selexoi(tm) or analogous solvents are contemplated.<br>
It is especially contemplated that the desired gaseous component is recovered from the rich solvent (i.e. the solvent containing the absorbed gas) as a flash gas by reducing the pressure in a flash unit to a level of preferably 0-65psia. However, alternative pressure levels are also contemplated including pressures within a range of Opsia to absorber pressure. This is particularly advantageous, because decompression of a rich solvent typically avoids conventional<br>
-  6   -<br><br>
WO 00/27505	PCT/IB99/01808<br>
an<br>
methods of producing an enriched solvent employing a heated stripper. However, where<br>
appropriate, it is contemplated that the rich solvent may also be stripped in a conventional steam-or otherwise heated stripper. Consequently, product 133 is not restricted to CO2 but may also be other gases, including CO, CH4, N2, etc.<br>
With respect to liquefaction unit 134A, various types of gas liquefying other than auto-rcfrigcration are also contemplated, including processes requiring an external refrigerant such as ammonia, fiuorohydrocarbons, or fluorochlorohydrocarbons. The liquefied CO: from liquefaction unit 134A preferably has a purity of greater than 98%(v/v). more preferably greater than 99%(v/v), and most preferably greater than 99.9%(v/v).<br>
In still other aspects of the inventive subject matter, the second PSA 140 unit need not necessarily be of the same type and capacity as the first PSA unit. For example, it is contemplated that while the specificity of the second PSA unit may be identical with the first PSA unit, the capacity, flow rate, or number of adsorbent beds may vary considerably. Where the amount of the desirable component is relatively small, a smaller PSA unit may be employed. In other cases, where processed offgases from multiple PSA units are combined to feed a single PSA unit, the second PSA units may have a larger capacity of increased flow rate. Furthermore, the specificity of the second PSA unit may also be different from the specificity of the first PSA unit. This may be especially advantageous where a third component is isolated from the offgas from the first PSA unit.<br>
Although it is preferred that the offgas from the second PSA unit is directed to a waste line or a reformer burner, it is contemplated that the offgas may also be utilized for other process steps that may or may not preserve the kinetic or chemical energy contained in the offgas. These process steps may include feeding a third PSA- or absorber unit, a burner other than a reformer burner, and so on. For example, a line may connect the second PSA unit with a reformer burner. It should also be appreciated that, although not specifically included in the preferred embodiment, one or more than one storage vessels may be included in the process to temporarily reduce pressure and/or gas volume in the PSA and/or absorber and liquefaction unit.<br>
In Figure 2 a schematic of another apparatus 200 for recovering hydrogen and carbon dioxide from an offgas of a PSA is shown. The apparatus 200 generally has a multi stage compressor configuration with compressors 212A and 212B, and a cooling system 214A and<br>
-   7   -<br><br>
WO 00/27505	FCT/IB99/01808<br>
214B in which a stream of offgas 210 from a first PSA unit is compressed. The compressed offgas is transferred to the absorber unit 220, and a stream of enriched compressed offgas 226 is transferred to a second PSA unit (not shown), where hydrogen is recovered from the enriched compressed offgas. The CO2-rich solvent from the absorber is directed to a flash unit 230 under control of level controller 224 and valve 222. The regenerated solvent is recycled to the absorber unit 220 via pump 232, valve 234, flow controller 236, level controller 238, and line 239. Cooling system 237 cools the regenerated solvent. A product stream 235 of CO2 from the flash unit is transferred to a vent or liquefaction unit (both not shown), whereby the flow is regulated by a valve 233 and a pressure controller 231.<br>
In Figure 3, a method 300 of recovering a first component and a second component from an offgas of a first pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit has a first step 310 in which the offgas of a PSA unit is compressed to produce a compressed offgas stream. In a subsequent step 320, at least some of the second component is recovered from the compressed offgas stream to produce an enriched compressed offgas stream, and in a next step 330, the enriched compressed offgas stream is passed to a second PSA unit to recover at least some of the first component.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the first PSA unit is a hydrogen PSA unit that has H2 as a product gas, and that produces an offgas comprising H2 and CO2. A compressor compresses the offgas to a pressure of about 300-500psig to produce a compressed offgas stream. At least some of the CO2 is recovered from the compressed offgas stream in an absorber unit employing Fluor Solvent(tm) as a fluid solvent to form an enriched compressed offgas stream (i.e. compressed offgas depleted from CO2). The enriched compressed offgas Is then fed into a second hydrogen PSA unit.<br>
With respect to the feed gas, the fist and second PSA unit, the absorber unit, and the compressor, the same considerations apply for the same components as discussed in Figure 1. It is farther contemplated that in some embodiments the second component, which may or may not be CO2, is recovered from the rich solvent by decompression in a flash unit by letting down the solvent to a pressure of between about 0-50psia. The recovered second components may thereby be further isolated and/or purified in a liquefaction unit, but it is also contemplated that recovered second component may also be-combusted in a steam reformer burner. In further alternative aspects of the inventive subject matter, at least part of the second offgas may be combusted in a steam reformer.<br>
-   8  -<br><br>
WO 00/27505	PCT/IB99/01808<br>
It should be especially appreciated that multiple advantages are achieved with the inventive subject matter presented herein. While both H2 and CO2 are recovered in the process, the additional recovery of hydrogen from the offgas of a PSA unit does not produce any incremental amount of NOx- Furthermore, the reformer combustion efficiency can be improved due to the absence of the low BTU PSA offgas.<br>
Thus, specific embodiments and applications of recovery of CO2 and H2 from the offgas from a pressure swing adsorption unit have been disclosed. It should be apparent, however, to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides those already described arc possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein. The inventive subject matter, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims. Moreover, in interpreting both the specification and the claims, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the context. In particular, the terms "comprises" and "comprising" should be interpreted as referring to elements, components, or steps in a nonexclusive manner, indicating that the referenced elements, components, or steps may be present, or utilized, or combined with other elements, components, or steps that are not expressly referenced.<br><br>

A gas separation apparatus and process has a first pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit (110) receiving feed gas (112), which comprises a first and a second component. First PSA unit (110) produces first product gas (114) pre-dominantly containing the first component, and first off gas (116) containing at least some of the first component and second component. Compressor (120) is coupled to first PSA unit (110) to compress first off gas (116) to form compressed off gas (126), which is passed downstream to absorber unit (130), which employs a solvent to remove at least part of the second component from compressed off gas (126), forming an enriched compressed off gas (136B). Second PSA unit (140) receives enriched compressed off gas (136B) and produces second product gas (142) which predominantly contains the first component and a second off gas that is sent to waste or reformer burner (150).<br></td>
