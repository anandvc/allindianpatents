TEST MEDIA AND QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE METHOD<br>
FOR IDENTIFICATION AND DIFFERENTIATION<br>
OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS IN A TEST SAMPLE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a test medium and method for the<br>
detection, quantification, identification and/or differentiation of biological<br>
materials in a sample, which may contain a plurality of different biological<br>
materials.<br>
Bacteria are the causative factor in many diseases of humans, higher<br>
animals and plants, and are commonly transmitted by carriers such as water,<br>
beverages, food and other organisms. The testing of these potential carriers of<br>
bacteria is of critical importance and generally relies on "indicator organisms."<br>
Borrego et al., Microbiol. Sem. 13:413-426, (1998). For example, Escherichia<br>
coli (E. coli) is a gram negative member of the family Enterobacteriaceae<br>
which is part of the normal intestinal flora of warm blooded animals, and its<br>
presence indicates fecal contamination {e.g., raw sewage). Even though most<br>
strains of E. coli are not the actual cause of disease, their presence is a strong<br>
indication of the possible presence of pathogens associated with intestinal<br>
disease, such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis, among others.<br>
Consequently, E. coli has become a prime indicator organism for fecal<br>
contamination, and as a result, any method which differentiates and identifies<br>
E. coli from other bacteria is very useful.<br>
Others members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, commonly referred<br>
to as "general coliforms," especially the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter and<br>
Klebsiella, are also considered to be significant indicator organisms for the<br>
quality of water, beverages and foods. Therefore, tests to identify and<br>
differentiate general coliforms from E. coli are also very useful. Also, various<br>
species of the genus Aeromonas have been shown to not only be potential<br>
pathogens, but to have a correlation to other indicator organisms (Pettibone et<br>
al., J Appl. Microbiol 85:723-730 (1998)). Current test methods to identify,<br>
separate and enumerate Aeromonas spp. from the very similar<br>
Enterobacteriaceae have been lacking and most of the current methods<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
2<br>
utilizing enzyme substrates do not separate Aeromonas spp. from<br>
Enterobacteriaceae due to their almost identical biochemical profiles. Any<br>
method that depends upon the identification of general coliforms by means of<br>
a β-galactosidase substrate either does not differentiate Aeromonas spp. from<br>
general coliforms or eliminates Aeromonas from the sample by the use of<br>
specific inhibitors (antibiotic such as cefsulodin). Brenner et al., Appl. Envir.<br>
Microbio. 59:3534-44 (1993). They do not differentiate, identify and<br>
enumerate Aeromonas along with E. coli and general coliforms. Landre et al.,<br>
Letters Appl Microbiol. 26:352-354(1998). Improved test methods to<br>
effectively identify, separate and enumerate such bacterial types are needed,<br>
and there is a continuing search for faster, more accurate, easier to use and<br>
more versatile test methods and apparatus in this area.<br>
Numerous test methods have been utilized to determine, identify and<br>
enumerate one or more indicator organisms. Some of these test methods only<br>
indicate the presence or absence of the microorganism, while others also<br>
attempt to quantify one or more of the particular organisms in the test sample.<br>
For example, a qualitative test referred to as the Presence/Absence (or P/A)<br>
test, may be utilized to determine the presence or absence of coliforms and£.<br>
coli in a test sample. A test medium including the β-galactosidase substrate O-<br>
nitrophenyl--β-galactopyranoside (ONPG), and the β-glucuronidase<br>
substrate 4-methyl-umbrelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide (MUG), is inoculated with<br>
the test sample. To differentiate the general coliforms from E. coli, this test<br>
relies on the fact that generally all coliforms produce |3-galactosidase, whereas<br>
only E. coli also produces β-glucuronidase in addition to β- galactosidase. If<br>
any coliforms are present (including E. coli), the broth medium turns a yellow<br>
color due to the activity of the galactosidase enzyme on the ONPG material,<br>
causing the release of a diffusible yellow pigment. If E. coli is present, the<br>
broth medium will demonstrate a blue fluorescence when irradiated with<br>
ultraviolet rays, due to the breakdown of the MUG reagent with the release of<br>
the fluorogenic dye caused by the production of the glucuronidase enzyme.<br>
These reactions are very specific, and allow the presence of both coliforms in<br>
general, as well as E. coli to be identified in a single sample. A disadvantage<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
3<br>
of this test is that it is not directly quantitative for either bacterial type, since<br>
both reagents produce diffusible pigments. A second disadvantage is that<br>
there may a false positive coliform reaction if Aeromonas spp. are present in<br>
the test sample. This has been shown to be possible even when there are<br>
inhibitors present to supposedly prevent this from occurring (Landre et al.,<br>
Letters Appl. Microbiol. 26:352-354 (1998)). The test also requires specific<br>
equipment for producing the ultraviolet rays. Further, this test may only be<br>
used to detect coliforms and E. coli. Other important microorganisms, such as<br>
the strain E. coli 0157 which is glucuronidase negative, are not detected, nor<br>
are other non-galactosidase-glucuronidase producing microorganisms.<br>
The Violet Red Bile Agar (VRBA) method has been used to determine<br>
the quantity of both coliform and E. coli in a test sample. The test medium<br>
used in this method includes bile salts (to inhibit non-coliforms), lactose and<br>
the pH indicator neutral red. As coliforms (including E. coli) grow in the<br>
medium, the lactose is fermented with acid production, and the neutral red in<br>
the area of the bacterial colony becomes a brick red color. The results of this<br>
test are not always easy to interpret, and in order to determine the presence of<br>
E. coli, confirming follow-up tests, such as brilliant green lactose broth<br>
fermentation, growth in EC broth at 44.5°C and streaking on Eosin Methylene<br>
Blue Agar (EMBA), must be performed.<br>
The Membrane Filter (MF) method utilizes micropore filters through<br>
which samples are passed so that the bacteria are retained on the surface of the<br>
filter. This method is used most often when bacterial populations are very<br>
small, and a large sample is needed to get adequate numbers. The filter is then<br>
placed on the surface of a chosen medium, incubated, and the bacterial<br>
colonies growing on the membrane filter surface are counted and evaluated.<br>
This method is widely used and provides good results when combined with<br>
proper reagents and media. A disadvantage of this method is that it is<br>
expensive and time-consuming. It also does not work well with solid samples,<br>
or samples with high particulate counts. The MF method can be used in<br>
conjunction with the inventive method described in this application.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
4<br>
The m-Endo method is also used to determine the quantity of E. coli<br>
and general coliforms and is an official USEPA approved method for testing<br>
water quality. The medium is commonly used with a membrane filter and E.<br>
coli and general coliform colony forming units (CFU) grow as dark colonies<br>
with a golden green metallic sheen. Due to a proven high rate of false positive<br>
error, typical colonies must be confirmed by additional testing. Standard<br>
Methodsfor the Examination of water and Wastewater, 20th Edition, 9-10 &amp;9-<br>
60(1998).<br>
Other tests, such as the Most Probable Number (MPN), utilize lactose-<br>
containing broths (LST, BGLB, EC) to estimate numbers of general coliforms<br>
and E. coli, but have also been shown to have high rates or error as well as<br>
being cumbersome and slow to produce results. Evans et al., Appl. Envir.<br>
Microhiol. 41:130-138 (1981).<br>
The reagent 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside<br>
(X-gal) is a known test compound for identifying coliforms. When acted on<br>
by the β-galactosidase enzyme produced by coliforms, X-gal forms an<br>
insoluble indigo blue precipitate. X-gal can be incorporated into a nutrient<br>
medium such as an agar plate, and if a sample containing coliforms is present,<br>
the coliforms will grow as indigo blue colonies. X-gal has the advantage over<br>
the compound ONPG, described above, in that it forms a water insoluble<br>
precipitate rather than a diffusible compound, thereby enabling a quantitative<br>
determination of coliforms to be made when the test sample is incorporated<br>
into or onto a solidified medium, or when coliform colonies grow on the<br>
surface of a membrane filter resting on a pad saturated with a liquid medium<br>
, or on a membrane filter resting on a solid medium. Further, it does not require<br>
the use of ultraviolet light.<br>
A similar compound, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide<br>
(X-gluc) is a known test compound for identifying E. coli. When acted on by<br>
the β-glucuronidase enzyme produced by most E. coli, X-gluc forms an<br>
insoluble indigo blue precipitate. X-gluc has the advantage over the<br>
compound MUG, described above, in that it forms a water insoluble<br>
precipitate, rather than a diffusible compound, thereby enabling a quantitative<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
5<br>
determination of E. coli to be made when the test sample is incorporated into<br>
or onto a solidified medium. X-gluc and its ability to identify E. coli are<br>
described in Watkins, et al., Appl. Envir. Microbiol. 54:1874-1875 (1988). A<br>
similar compound, indoxyl-β-D-glucuronide, which also produces sharp blue<br>
colonies of E. coli, was described in Ley, et al., Can. J. Microbiol 34:690-693<br>
(1987).<br>
Although X-gal and X-gluc are each separately useful in the<br>
quantitative determination of either conforms (X-gal) or E. coli (X-gluc), these<br>
indicator compounds have the disadvantage that they each contain the same<br>
chromogenic component. Therefore, they cannot be used together to identify<br>
and distinguish both E. coli and general coliforms in a single test with a single<br>
sample, since they both generate identically hued indigo blue colonies. A<br>
person using both reagents together would be able to quantitatively identify<br>
the total number of coliforms, the same as if X-gal were used alone, but would<br>
not be able to indicate which of the colonies were E. coli and which were other<br>
coliforms besides E. coli.<br>
A recently developed and highly commercially successful test method<br>
and test medium for quantitatively identifying and differentiating general<br>
coliforms and E. coli in a test sample is described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,210,022, and 5,393,662, both of which share common inventorship with the<br>
present application and which are hereby incorporated by reference. This<br>
method and test medium improves upon prior art methods by allowing the<br>
quantitative identification of general coliforms and E. coli in a single sample.<br>
Additional confirmatory tests are not necessary. The test sample is added to a<br>
medium containing a β-galactosidase substrate, such as 6-chloroindolyl-β-D-<br>
galactoside, and a β-glucuronidase substrate, such as 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-<br>
indolyl-β-D-glucuronide (X-gluc). The β-galactosidase substrate is capable of<br>
forming a water insoluble precipitate of a first color upon reacting with [3-<br>
galactosidase, and the β-glucuronidase substrate is capable of forming a water<br>
insoluble precipitate of a second color, contrasting with the first color, upon<br>
reacting with β-glucuronidase. As a result, general coliforms may be<br>
quantified by enumerating the colonies of the first color (having β-<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
6<br>
galactosidase activity), and E. coli may be quantified by enumerating the<br>
colonies of the second color (having both β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase<br>
activity). This technology has been widely copied.<br>
Another recently developed test method and apparatus provides<br>
excellent results for the differentiation and identification of general coliforms,<br>
E. coli and E. coli 0157 strains and non-coliform Enterobacleriaceae . The<br>
method and test medium are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,726,031, which<br>
shares common inventorship with the present application, and which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
A certain class of substrates, referred to herein as "nonchromogenic,"<br>
have been used to detect various microorganisms. A dipslide for detecting E.<br>
coli using hydroxy-quinoline- β-D-glucuronide is disclosed by Dalet et al., J<br>
Clin. Microbiol, 33(5):1395-8 (1995). Similarly, a technique for detection of<br>
E. coli in an agar-based medium using 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-glucuronide is<br>
disclosed by James et al., Zentralbl Bakteriol Mikrobiol Hyg [A], 267(3):316-<br>
21 (1988).<br>
It is desirable to further improve the distinguishing colors generated in<br>
the test media. That is to say, in prior art test media which detect and<br>
distinguishing two biological entities, confusion may arise between the two<br>
colors which show in the media.<br>
Further, it is desirable to be able to identify and differentiate other<br>
closely related organisms, such as members of the families Aeromonaceae,<br>
Vibrionaceae, and Salmonella. For example, the genus Aeromonas is closely<br>
related to coliforms and gives an almost identical biochemical test pattern.<br>
Further, the genus Vibrio is also an important type of bacteria that grows under<br>
the same general conditions as coliforms. It is known to distinguish<br>
Aeromonas colonies from general coliforms by testing all colonies in a given<br>
sample for the presence of cytochrome oxidase. Undesirably, however, this<br>
requires another set of tests. Further, Aeromonas is common in water and<br>
food, and it is commonly indicated in test samples as general coliforms, which<br>
results in high a false positive error for general coliforms by most current test<br>
methods. The Aeromonas can be prevented from interfering with the coliform<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
7<br>
results by adding certain antibiotics to the medium. However, the antibiotic<br>
amounts added must be carefully controlled. Further, the antibiotics which<br>
have been conventionally used have short life spans in the media so that they<br>
lose their potency quickly in other than a frozen condition. It may often be<br>
desirable to be able to culture, identify and enumerate Aeromonas spp. which<br>
cannot be done if they are inhibited.<br>
Further, in those cases where it is desirable to inhibit Aeromonas, it is<br>
desirable for a better method of so doing, one in which the shelf life of the<br>
medium is not appreciably reduced by the inclusion of an inhibitor.<br>
Additionally, it is also desirable to distinguish strains of Salmonella<br>
from E. coli, general conforms and Aeromonas.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of prior art<br>
methods by providing a test method and medium for quantitatively or<br>
qualitatively identifying and differentiating biological entities in a test sample<br>
that may include a plurality of different biological entities.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention introduces the use of<br>
"nonchromogenic" substrates to enhance the distinction among multiple colors<br>
produced by distinct biological entities present in the inventive test medium.<br>
Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that other "chromogenic" substrates<br>
present in the inventive test medium do not interfere with the substantially<br>
black color achieved with the nonchromogenic substrate. That is to say, so<br>
long as a given biological entity is responsive to the nonchromogenic<br>
substrate, aggregations thereof present in the test medium will show as a<br>
substantially black color-independent of whether such biological entity is<br>
responsive to one, two or more chromogenic substrates which are also present<br>
in the medium. The present invention exploits this hitherto unexplored<br>
property of nonchromogenic substrates.<br>
In one form thereof, the present invention provides a test medium for<br>
detecting, identifying and qualifying or quantifying first and second biological<br>
entities. The test medium includes a nutrient base medium including ions of a<br>
salt, a chromogenic substrate and a nonchromogenic substrate. The First<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
8<br>
biological entity is responsive to the nonchromogenic substrate whereas the<br>
second biological entity is responsive to the chromogenic substrate. In this test<br>
medium, aggregations of the first biological entity present in the test medium<br>
are substantially black and aggregations of the second biological entity present<br>
in the test medium are a second color, the second color being distinguishable<br>
from the substantially black.<br>
In one form, the inventive test medium accounts for the first biological<br>
entity being responsive to the chromogenic substrate in addition to the<br>
nonchromogenic substrate. In such event, aggregations of the first biological<br>
entity present in the test medium will nonetheless show as substantially black.<br>
Significantly, even though the aggregations of the first biological entity<br>
are responsive to both the first and second substrates in this form, these<br>
aggregations still show as substantially black in the test medium. That is, the<br>
chromogenic substrate does not interfere with the substantially black color.<br>
Advantageously, this property of nonchromogenic substrates allows several<br>
different biological entities to be identified and differentiated in a single<br>
medium, aggregations of each biological entity having a visually<br>
distinguishable color.<br>
In another form of the above-described inventive medium, the medium<br>
further includes the antibiotic nalidixic acid to inhibit the growth of<br>
Aeromonas, spp. Advantageously, it has been found that nalidixic acid, as<br>
compared with cefsulodin, does not significantly reduce the shelf life of the<br>
test medium incorporating it.<br>
In this connection, another form of the present invention provides a<br>
method of making a test medium for detecting at least one first type of<br>
biological entity and inhibiting a second type of biological entity from<br>
growing in the medium. The method includes the steps of combining desired<br>
substrates with a nutrient base medium; adding an inhibitor to the medium;<br>
and then sterilizing the medium by subjecting the medium to at least 100°C.<br>
Because the inhibitor is added as an initial step, subsequent sterile addition of<br>
inhibitor is unnecessary.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
9<br>
In another form thereof, the present invention provides a test medium<br>
for detecting, identifying and qualifying or quantifying first, second and third<br>
biological entities. The test medium includes a nutrient base medium including<br>
ions of a salt. First and second chromogenic substrates and a nonchromogenic<br>
substrate are provided in the test medium. The first and second biological<br>
entities are responsive to the first and the second chromogenic substrates,<br>
respectively, and the third biological entity is responsive to the<br>
nonchromogenic substrate. Aggregations of the first biological entity present<br>
in the test medium are a first color, aggregations of the second biological<br>
entity present in the test medium are a second color, and aggregations of the<br>
third biological entity present in the test medium are substantially black.<br>
In one form, the inventive test medium accounts for the third biological<br>
entity being responsive to the first and/or the second chromogenic substrates<br>
in addition to the nonchromogenic substrate. In such event, aggregations of<br>
the third biological entity will nonetheless show as substantially black.<br>
It should be appreciated that the use of a nonchromogenic substrate<br>
along with one or more chromogenic substrates synergistically increases the<br>
number of biological entities that can be detected and distinguished in a single<br>
medium and synergistically increases the possible color combinations for a<br>
given set of biological entities to be detected. Stated another way, including a<br>
nonchromogenic component as one of the substrates synergistically increases<br>
the degrees of freedom in selecting other substrates and corresponding colors<br>
for a test medium. This is so because an aggregation of the biological entity<br>
which is responsive to the nonchromogenic substrate will dependably show as<br>
substantially black. No combined color effects need be accounted for with the<br>
nonchromogenic substrates. For example, in a test medium including three<br>
chromogenic substrates and a nonchromogenic substrate, at least three<br>
combined color combination effects are avoided by using the one<br>
nonchromogenic component, as compared with using four chromogenic<br>
components.<br>
The present invention, in another form thereof, provides a test medium<br>
capable of detecting, quantifying, and differentiating general coliforms and/or<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
10<br>
E. coli spp. under ambient light. The test medium comprises a nutrient based<br>
medium including a salt. A first substrate capable of forming a first water<br>
insoluble component of a first color in the presence of E. coli and the ions of<br>
the salt is provided in the medium. The first color is substantially black. A<br>
second substrate capable of forming a second water insoluble component of a<br>
second color in the presence of general coliforms is provided. The second<br>
color is visually distinguishable from the first color. Thus, colonies of E. coli<br>
present in the test medium are indicated by the first substantially black color<br>
and colonies of general coliforms are indicated by the second color.<br>
In one form of the above invention, the test medium further includes a<br>
third substrate capable of forming a third water insoluble component of a third<br>
color in the presence of Salmonella. The third color is distinguishable from<br>
the first and second colors, whereby the test medium is capable of quantifying<br>
and/or differentiating E. coli, general coliforms and Salmonella. Further, the<br>
substrates are selected such that general coliforms present in the test medium<br>
will also react with the third substrate to form a water insoluble component<br>
which includes the third color. Consequently, general coliform colonies are<br>
indicated in the test medium as a fourth color, the fourth color being a<br>
combination of the second color and the third color. The fourth color is<br>
visually distinguishable from the first and third colors. Still further, the<br>
substrates can be selected such that Aeromonas spp. form an insoluble<br>
component of the second color by reacting with the second substrate, but not<br>
the first and third substrates. Thus, in the inventive test medium, E. coli<br>
colonies will be generally black, general coliform colonies will be the fourth<br>
color, Aeromonas colonies will be the second color and Salmonella colonies<br>
will be the third color.<br>
In another form thereof, the present invention provides a method for<br>
detecting, quantifying and differentiating under ambient light general<br>
coliforms, E. coli, and at least one of the genera Aeromonas ox Salmonella in a<br>
test sample. The method comprises the steps of providing a nutrient base<br>
medium including first, second and third substrates. Each of the substrates is<br>
capable of forming a water insoluble component in the presence of at least one<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
11<br>
of general coliforms, E. coli, Aeromonas, Salmonella. The substrates are<br>
selected such that colonies of E. coli produced in the test medium are a first<br>
color, colonies of general coliforms produced in the test medium are a second<br>
color, and colonies of one of Aeromonas and Salmonella produced in the test<br>
medium are a third color. Each of the colors are visually distinguishable. The<br>
test medium is inoculated with the test sample and then incubated. The test<br>
medium is then examined for the presence of first colonies having the first<br>
color, second colonies having the second color, and third colonies having the<br>
third color. The first colonies are E. coli, the second colonies are general<br>
coliforms, and the third colonies are one of Aeromonas or Salmonella.<br>
In one form thereof, the inventive method further includes adding ions<br>
from a salt to the test medium to react with one or more of the substrates. In<br>
so doing, a precipitate is produced which shows as a substantially black color<br>
in the presence of the specific enzyme for that substrate. A preferred<br>
compound for forming the substantially black color in the presence of the ions<br>
of the salt consists of a β-D-glucuronide. These compounds release an<br>
aglycone when hydrolized which forms a substantially black insoluble<br>
complex in the presence of ions.<br>
In another form of the inventive method, the method further comprises<br>
examining the test medium for the presence of fourth colonies having a fourth<br>
color, wherein the substrates are selected such that colonies of Aeromonas are<br>
the third color and colonies of Salmonella are the fourth color, the fourth color<br>
being visually distinguishable from the first, the second and the third colors.<br>
The substrates may be selected such that the first color is substantially black,<br>
the second color is substantially blue-violet, the third color is substantially red-<br>
pink and the fourth color is substantially teal-green.<br>
In another form of the inventive method, the substrates are selected<br>
such that colonies of Aeromonas as well as colonies of Plesiomonas and<br>
Vibrios are indicated as the third color.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention uses a nonchromogenic<br>
substrate along with one or more chromogenic substrates and thereby<br>
synergistically increases the degrees of design freedom in selecting colors for<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
12<br>
the inventive test medium. This is so because the chromogenic substrates do<br>
not interfere with the substantially black precipitate formed by the<br>
nonchromogenic substrate.<br>
Another advantage of one embodiment of the present invention is that<br>
it enables the quantification, identification and differentiation of four (4)<br>
different bacterial strains simultaneously in a single test medium using a single<br>
test sample, under ambient lighting. Subsequent tests with their concomitant<br>
extra time spent and extra costs are avoided. Of course, the inventive test<br>
medium of the present invention could also be used purely for qualitative<br>
purposes, as a mere presence/absence (P/A) test.<br>
In one embodiment, the substrates are selected such that the colors are<br>
easy to visually distinguish from one another without the need for UV light or<br>
other visual aids, other than, perhaps, magnification means. For example, in<br>
one embodiment, E. coli colonies are clearly indicated by a precipitate having<br>
a substantially black color, general coliform colonies are indicated by a blue-<br>
violet color, Aeromonas colonies are indicated by a red-pink color, and<br>
Salmonella colonies are indicated by a teal-green color. Because these colors<br>
are visually so distinct, confusion among the colors is greatly reduced as<br>
compared to prior art media. In one embodiment, MUGluc (4-<br>
methylumbelliferyl-Beta-D-glucuronic acid) is used in place of a<br>
nonchromogenic substrate. In this test medium, general coliforms would still<br>
be indicated by a blue-violet or grayish color. Aeromonas colonies indicated<br>
by a red-pink color and Salmonella colonies indicated by a teal-green color;<br>
however, E. coli colonies would look the same in visible light as general<br>
coliforms, but also would fluoresce a bright bluish color under a long wave<br>
UV light and this could be distinguished from the other colonies. Although,<br>
the fluorescent product would diffuse more quickly than chromogenic or<br>
nonchromogenic substrates and make quantifying the colonies of E. coli more<br>
difficult, the E. coli colonies can be detected at around 14 hours incubation<br>
time, and in any case will suffice as a presence/absence test for the E. coli.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, it has been found that<br>
three chromogenic substrates may be used if properly combined. For<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
13<br>
example, a β-glucuronide such as X-Gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-P-D-<br>
glucuronic acid) or Iodo-Gluc (5-iodo-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronic acid) may be<br>
used with chromogenic a- and β-D-galactoside substrates. Examples of a- and<br>
β-galactoside substrates that may be suitable are 6-chloro-3-indolyl-P-D-<br>
galactoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactoside. In this<br>
embodiment, the β-D-glucuronide and α-D-galactoside substrates form the<br>
same general color in the presence of colonies that produce the respective<br>
enzymes; however, the colors may be distinguished by providing the<br>
substrates in different amounts so that the resulting color produced by one is<br>
darker than that produced by the other. In addition, even if the substrates are<br>
provided in approximately the same amounts, colonies that react to both the β-<br>
D-glucuronide and α-D-galactoside, such as E. coli should be darker that<br>
colonies such as general coliforms, which only react to the α-D-galactoside It<br>
should be appreciated, that it would not be necessary to add ions of salt if a<br>
nonchromogenic substrate is not used.<br>
In an additional aspect of the present invention, MUGluc or another<br>
fluorescent glucuronide substrate may be combined in a test medium with a<br>
chromogenic or nonchromogenic glucuronide substrate. In this case, the<br>
MUGluc substrate can be used to detect E. coli under fluorescent light with<br>
less incubation time than is required to detect colonies with a chromogenic or<br>
nonchromogenic glucuronide. In addition, the MUGluc substrate can serve as<br>
a confirmation of the presence/absence of E. coli, if for any reasons there is<br>
some question as to the colors visible in ambient light produced by the<br>
colonies in the presence of the substrates.<br>
Another advantage of the test medium of the present invention is its<br>
flexibility and ease of use. The incubation temperature is not critical as<br>
growth and differentiation of the organisms mentioned may occur within an<br>
optimum range. Therefore, resuscitation steps are avoided and inhibition of<br>
temperature sensitive strains does not occur. Also, inexpensive equipment<br>
may be used.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the color distinction<br>
obtained in a test medium can be intensified for identifying and differentiating<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
14<br>
E. coli from general coliforms. In one test medium, E. coli colonies present a<br>
substantially black color, whereas general coliforms present a red-pink color,<br>
the distinction therebetween being much more apparent than in prior art test<br>
media. Confusion between the two colors is therefore greatly reduced.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is that it enables the<br>
identification and differentiation of Aeromonas spp. from general coliforms.<br>
Prior art test media undesirably require using a cefsulodin inhibitor for<br>
preventing Aeromonas spp. from growing therein. However, the use of<br>
cefsulodin as an inhibitor requires an extra step in the process, viz., sterile<br>
addition of filter sterilized antibiotic, and is difficult to control. Further, the<br>
presence of cefsulodin significantly reduces the effective shelf life of the<br>
medium. Further, the use of an inhibitor, obviously, prevents the detection<br>
and quantitification of Aeromonas spp. Advantageously, with the present<br>
invention, Aeromonas spp. can be detected, quantified and differentiated from<br>
general coliforms in a single medium.<br>
As a related advantage, if it is nonetheless desired to inhibit colonies of<br>
Aeromonas spp. from growing in the test medium, the present invention<br>
provides a superior means for doing so. Specifically, preferred forms of the<br>
present invention employ nalidixic acid as an inhibitor, which has been shown<br>
to have a far less deleterious effect to the shelf-life of the medium<br>
incorporating it. Further, nalidixic acid can be added as part of the initial<br>
medium formulation prior to sterilization, thereby avoiding a costly and<br>
difficult process step which is required with cefsulodin. Finally, nalidixic acid<br>
is much less expensive than cefsulodin.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that it can provide a test<br>
medium for qualitative or quantitative testing. That is, the test media in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be used as mere presence/absence<br>
test devices, or can be used to quantify various biological entities showing as<br>
different colored colonies on the inventive test media.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The method and medium of the present invention allow the<br>
simultaneous detection, quantification, identification and differentiation of a<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
15<br>
variety of selected biological entities in a sample of mixed populations of<br>
biological entities. The inventive method and medium are particularly useful<br>
for the detection, quantification, identification and differentiation of E. coli<br>
and general coliforms, and further quantitative identification and<br>
differentiation of other selected biological entities, including Aeromonas,<br>
Salmonella, and Vibrio bacterial species.<br>
The method and test media incorporating the present invention utilize<br>
the fact that the enzymatic activity of biological entities and specifically of<br>
bacteria varies with the genus, and/or family of bacteria of interest. The<br>
method and test media incorporating the present invention further utilize the<br>
fact that various enzyme identifying substrate complexes can be used to<br>
identify specific enzymes with the production of distinctive colors.<br>
Significantly, in one embodiment of the present invention, the method and test<br>
media incorporating the present invention exploit the fact that chromogenic<br>
substrates present in a test medium do not interfere with the substantially black<br>
color produced by nonchromogenic substrates.<br>
While nonchromogenic substrates are known in the art, per se, their<br>
distinct properties vis-a-vis chromogenic substrates have been unrecognized.<br>
However, the behavior of a nonchromogenic substrate in a medium including<br>
the combination of chromogenic substrates is unique. To illustrate,<br>
aggregations of a biological entity which are responsive to two chromogenic<br>
substrates will typically show in a test medium as a combination of the two<br>
colors produced upon cleavage of the two respective substrates. When three<br>
chromogenic substrates are involved, as in another embodiment of the<br>
invention, the combined color effect is not obvious to predict and account for.<br>
Further, inherent variations in the amount of enzymes produced by particular<br>
strains of biological entities can result in different shades or hues of colors<br>
upon cleavage of the chromogenic substrates. Consequently, the colors can be<br>
difficult to distinguish for the lay person examining the test medium.<br>
Chromogenic substrates must therefore be chosen and used in a concentration<br>
in view of the other chromogenic substrates planned for inclusion in a given<br>
test medium.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
16<br>
Such is not the case with the nonchromogenic components. While<br>
aggregations of biological entities which are responsive to chromogenic<br>
substrates in addition to nonchromogenic substrates may show in the test<br>
medium as having a colored or fluorescent "halo," such aggregations<br>
nonetheless appear substantially black and are therefore easy to identify.<br>
Multiple "degrees of freedom" are achieved with the nonchromogenic<br>
components.<br>
Using a nonchromogenic substrate is one way of enabling a single test<br>
medium to differentiate four (4) different bacterial strains with four (4)<br>
visually distinguishable colors. The black color is difficult to mistake. Further,<br>
the substantially black pigmentation does not diffuse so that the location of the<br>
colonies is precisely known and the colonies can be accurately counted. The<br>
nonchromogenic substrates produce an insoluble chelated compound which is<br>
different than the dimer which is produced by the chromogenic substrates.<br>
The inventive test medium and method allows not only a detection,<br>
quantification or qualitative identification and differentiation of genera]<br>
coliforms and E. coli, but also of Salmonella and Aeromonas, as well as<br>
Plesiomonas and Vibrio. Plesiomonas and Vibrios species are determined<br>
but not differentiated from Aeromonas species as they are very closely related.<br>
Definitions<br>
Biological entities, such as general coliforms, E. coli., etc., are herein<br>
referred to as being "responsive" to certain chromogenic and nonchromogenic<br>
substrates. More specifically, a biological entity will predictably produce<br>
specific enzymes when the entity is present in a test medium such as the one<br>
described hereinbelow. These enzymes will selectively cleave chromogenic<br>
and nonchromogenic substrates. Upon cleavage, these substrates produce a<br>
color in the test medium. The mechanism for producing the color is different<br>
for chromogenic and nonchromogenic substrates, as described hereinbelow.<br>
Microorganisms having p-galactosidase activity include those<br>
commonly known by the designation "coliform." There are various definitions<br>
of "coliform," but the generally accepted ones include bacteria which are<br>
members of the Enter obacteriaceae family, and have the ability to ferment the<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
17<br>
sugar lactose with the evolution of gas and acid. Most coliforms are positive<br>
for both α-and β-galactosidase. That is, they produce both α-and β-<br>
galactosidases.<br>
Microorganisms having P-glucuronidase activity in addition to<br>
galactosidase activity primarily include most strains of Escherichia coli. That<br>
is, E. coli is positive for both α- and β-galactosidase as well as β-<br>
glucuronidase.<br>
The term "general coliforms" as used in this application refers to<br>
coliforms other than the various strains of E. coli. These "general coliforms"<br>
are gram-negative, non-spore forming microorganisms generally having α-<br>
and β-galactosidase activity (i.e., lactose fermenters), but not having β-<br>
glucuronidase activity, and having the ability to ferment the sugar sorbitol.<br>
For purposes of this specification, a "chromogenic substrate" is a<br>
substrate which needs no additional chemicals present in the test medium upon<br>
hydrolysis for color production. That is, a chromogenic substrate is cleaved by<br>
the specific enzyme corresponding to that substrate to form a dimer with the<br>
color being concentrated in the area of cleavage of the substrate. Many<br>
chromogenic substrates are known in the art. For purposes of this specification<br>
"chromogenic" includes fiuorogenic substrates. The products of fluorogenic<br>
substrates require ultraviolet (UV) light to be detected and are more water<br>
soluble than other chromogenic substrates.<br>
Certain substrates, referred to herein as "nonchromogenic," produce a<br>
dark, substantially black precipitate in the presence of ions of a salt and<br>
enzyme activity. For example, 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-glucuronide, when<br>
included in a medium along with a salt that produces ions, such as ferric<br>
ammonium citrate, will produce a substantially black precipitate in the<br>
presence of P-glucuronidase produced by E. coli or other biological entities.<br>
More specifically, upon cleavage of the nonchromogenic substrate by the<br>
particular enzyme, a substantially black water-insoluble complex forms in the<br>
medium. The substantially black precipitate consists of the ferric ions and the<br>
aglycone released when the substrate is hydrolized by the glucuronidase from<br>
E. coli. This precipitate is a chelated compound which does not diffuse. Nor is<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
18<br>
the substantially black color susceptible to interference from chromogenic<br>
compounds present in the test medium.<br>
For purposes of this specification, a "nonchromogenic substrate"<br>
means that a chemical in addition to those used with chromogenic components<br>
must be present in the test medium when the substrate is cleaved by its<br>
corresponding enzyme. The substantially black precipitate formed thereby is a<br>
combination of the substrate - salt complex and is not a dimer as is formed by<br>
the "chromogenic compounds."<br>
For purposes of this specification, the expression "under ambient light"<br>
refers to the visible spectrum, i.e., colors which can be seen and distinguished<br>
with the naked eye. A colony present in a test medium which requires<br>
ultraviolet light to be seen, for example, would not fall under the definition<br>
"under ambient light". However, it is to be understood that the term "under<br>
ambient light" includes using a magnification device, if necessary.<br>
Magnification can be especially helpful when counting numerous colonies.<br>
The term "visually distinguishable" refers to two or more colors which can be<br>
differentiated under ambient light.<br>
For purposes of this specification, the term "substantially black"<br>
includes dark brown to black, and also includes black with various colored<br>
halos, such as red-violet, green, fluorescent, etc.<br>
For further purposes of this specification, color names recited herein<br>
are given as guidance, but it is to be understood that the color names are to be<br>
read broadly. That is, there can be overlap among the recited colors. This is<br>
because, as discussed, biological entities produce varying amounts of<br>
enzymes, which in turn affects the shade or hue of the resulting color.<br>
The term "β-galactosidase substrate" as used herein refers to a β-<br>
galactoside comprising galactose joined by β-lmkage to a substituent that<br>
forms a detectable compound when liberated by the action of β-galactosidase<br>
on the substrate. Similarly, the term "α-galactosidase substrate" as used herein<br>
refers to α-galactoside comprising galactose joined by α-linkage to a<br>
substituent that forms a detectable compound when liberated by the action of<br>
a-galactosidase on the substrate. The term "β-glucuronidase substrate" as used<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
19<br>
herein refers to a β-glucuronide comprising glucuronic acid joined by β-<br>
linkage to a substituent that forms a detectable precipitate when liberated by<br>
the action of β-glucuronidase on the substrate.<br>
The α- and β-galactosidase substrates and compounds and any other<br>
substrates described herein as well as the β-glucuronidase substrates and<br>
compounds and any other substrates described herein may comprise<br>
carboxylate salts formed by reacting a suitable base with the appropriate<br>
galactoside or glucuronic carboxyl group. Suitable bases include alkali metal<br>
or alkaline earth metal hydroxides or carbonates, for example, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide,<br>
and corresponding carbonates; and nitrogen bases such as ammonia, and<br>
alkylamines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine and cyclohexylamine.<br>
Designing a Test Medium for Specific Biological Entities<br>
Certain members of the family Enterobacteriaceae can be<br>
distinguished by the presence of α-galactosidase activity in the absence of β-<br>
galactosidase activity, or vice-versa. For example, most Salmonella and<br>
Shigella spp. are positive for a-galactosidase, but negative for β-galactosidase.<br>
Similarly, Aeromonas spp. can be distinguished from other members of the<br>
family Enter obacteriaceae by the presence of β-galactosidase activity in the<br>
absence of α-galactosidase activity. The method and medium incorporating<br>
the present invention are designed to take advantage of these distinguishing<br>
characteristics. For example, the specificity of enzyme activity for Salmonella<br>
and Aeromonas spp., as opposed to general coliforms, can be exploited, as<br>
illustrated below.<br>
The method described herein is particularly suitable for the detection,<br>
quantification or qualitative identification and differentiation of the different<br>
classes of microorganisms described previously, viz., general coliforms, E.<br>
coli, Aeromonas and Salmonella. Although the inventive method is<br>
particularly suitable for these particular microorganisms, it is not limited<br>
thereto. Instead, the techniques described herein have application to the<br>
identification and differentiation of a wide variety of biological entities.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
20<br>
That is, specific biological entities are "responsive" to various<br>
substrates. More particularly, these biological entities predictably produce or<br>
contain known enzymes. Substrates, either chromogenic or nonchromogenic,<br>
can be selected which, in the presence of a particular enzyme(s), will form a<br>
product of a predictable and distinguishable color. Multiple substrates can be<br>
selected to simultaneously identify a plurality of distinct biological entities in<br>
a single test medium, aggregations of each distinct entity being identifiable by<br>
a separate, distinguishable color. Further, while certain embodiments<br>
disclosed herein distinguish all of the various aggregations present in a test<br>
medium under ambient light, as that term is defined herein, such is not<br>
necessary. For example, several substrates disclosed herein require the use of<br>
ultraviolet light for the aggregations present in the medium to be seen.<br>

Iodo-indolyl substrates, such as 5-iodo-3-indolyl-β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside are available through Biosynth International, Naperville, IL.<br>
Several fluorescent substrates are suitable for use with the present<br>
invention. Coumarin substrates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates and<br>
5-trifluoromethylumbelliferyl substrates are commercially available from<br>
Biosynth International, Naperville, IL. Also suitable are fluorescein<br>
substrates, rhodamine substrates, and resorufin substrates. No commercial<br>
source is known for these three substrates but components are available from<br>
Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO.<br>
While specific examples of substrates suitable for use with the present<br>
invention have been enumerated hereinabove, such is not to be construed as<br>
limiting the invention in any manner. Instead, one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
can use Table IV and V hereinbelow to identify a virtually limitless number of<br>
substrates.<br>
Preparation of Test Medium<br>
The test medium is formed by combining the desired substrates with a<br>
nutrient base medium. The nutrient base medium can be any culture medium<br>
known in the art for providing the maintenance and reproduction of living<br>
cells. Generally, such media include nutrients, buffers, water, and sometimes<br>
a gelling agent. Possible gelling agents include agars, pectins, carrageenans,<br>
alginates, locust bean, and xanthins, among others.<br>
The following is an example of the preparation of a test medium<br>
suitable for use in this invention. This example coincides with Example I,<br>
below.<br>
The substrates 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-glucuronide, 5-Bromo-4-<br>
chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside, and 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside are added in quantities of 250 mg/L medium; 70 mg/L<br>
medium; and 175 mg/L medium, respectively. The substrates are added<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
24<br>
directly to the hot (75°- 85°C) medium (formula below) in a blender prior to<br>
sterilization.<br>
Standard agar medium may be made by adding 15 gm of<br>
bacteriological quality agar gum to the following nutrient formula<br><br>
and then sterilizing at 121 °C for 15 minutes. The medium should be adjusted<br>
to result in a pH of 7.0. The sterilized agar medium is allowed to drop to a<br>
temperature of 45°C in a water bath and then the sterile solution containing the<br>
substrates prepared as described above is added. The medium is mixed<br>
thoroughly and poured into sterile petri plates at a volume of 20 ml/plate.<br>
A pectin-based test medium may be prepared using the same steps<br>
described above except that 25 gm of low methoxyl pectin is used as the<br>
solidifying agent and the medium is poured at room temperature into petri<br>
plates containing a thin gel layer containing calcium ions which combine with<br>
the pectin to form a solid gel. A suitable pectin culture medium is described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,241,186 and U.S. Patent No. 4,282,317, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. A pectin-based medium is<br>
preferred over a standard agar medium because it has the advantages of<br>
convenience and temperature independence for the user. The use of pectin<br>
media is well described and accepted as a result of AOAC collaborative<br>
studies and other published and in-house investigations.<br>
A suitable pectin medium is commercially available from Micrology<br>
Laboratories, LLC under the trademark Easygel®. Aqueous based medium<br>
without gelling agent is available from Micrology Labs, Goshen IN., for use<br>
with membrane filters.<br><br>

Inoculation of the Test Medium with the Sample<br>
The test medium may be inoculated with a sample to be tested for the<br>
presence of microorganisms by any method known in the art for inoculating a<br>
medium with a sample containing microorganisms. For example, the sample<br>
to be tested may be added to the petri plates prior to adding the nutrient base<br>
medium (pour plate technique) or spread on the surface of the plates after they<br>
have cooled and solidified (swab or streak plate technique). Liquid samples<br>
may also be filtered through a micropore (.45 micrometer size) membrane<br>
filter which is then placed on the surface of a solid medium or on a pad<br>
saturated with the medium.<br>
Incubation of the Test Medium<br>
The inoculated test medium is incubated for a sufficient time and at<br>
such a temperature for individual microorganisms present in the sample to<br>
grow into detectable colonies. Suitable incubation conditions for growing<br>
microorganisms in a medium are known in the art. Commonly, the test<br>
medium is incubated for about 24-48 hours at a temperature of about 30°-<br>
4CPC. Less incubation time may be required, such as about 14 hours, to obtain<br>
results for a fluorescent substrate.<br>
Unless inhibitors of the general microbial population are used, the<br>
general microbial population as well as general coliforms, E. coli, Aeromonas<br>
spp., and Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. will grow in the incubated test<br>
medium. Because the precipitates formed are insoluble (except for the<br>
fluorogenic substrates) in the test medium, they remain in the immediate<br>
vicinity of microorganisms producing the various enzymes. As the<br>
microorganisms reproduce to form colonies, the colonies show as colony<br>
forming units having the color produced by the particular substrate.<br>
For example, E. coli produces |3-galactosidase and β-galactosidase, but,<br>
unlike general coliforms and Aeromonas spp., also produces β-glucuronidase.<br>
Therefore, insoluble precipitates of each of the β-galactosidase substrate, the<br>
β-galactosidase substrate and the nonchromogenic β-glucuronide substrate are<br>
formed by the action of the respective enzymes such that colonies of E. coli<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
26<br>
show as a substantially black color, sometimes having a violet-blue halo<br>
therearound.<br>
General coliforms produce β-galactosidase and α-galactosidase and<br>
consequently cleave both the a-galactosidase and β-galactosidase substrates.<br>
In the present example, the 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactoside<br>
substrate produces a blue-green or teal color, whereas the 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-<br>
β-D-galactoside produces a pink, or red-pink color. Thus, general coliform<br>
colonies will show as a blue-violet color, which is a combination of the colors<br>
produced by each of the α- and β-galactosides, respectively.<br>
Significantly, however, it has been found that Aeromonas spp., which<br>
are closely related to coliforms, and give an almost identical biochemical test<br>
pattern, are β-galactosidase positive and a-galactosidase negative. That is,<br>
Aeromonas spp. will not hydrolize the α-galactoside substrate. Therefore,<br>
Aeromonas colonies present in the test medium will show as colonies having<br>
the pink-red color produced by the β-galactoside substrate.<br>
Further, it has been found that members of the genus Salmonella are<br>
positive for a-galactosidase, but negative for p-galactosidase. That is,<br>
Salmonella will not hydrolize the β-galactosidase substrate. Therefore,<br>
colonies of Salmonella present in the test medium will appear as a teal, or<br>
blue-green color produced by the a-galactoside substrate.<br>
Examination of the Test Medium and Enumeration of Microorganisms<br>
The substrates selected for the above example produce three distinct<br>
colors, and general coliforms are indicated by a fourth color which is a<br>
combination of two of the three colors. That is, E. coli colonies show as<br>
substantially black, general coliform colonies show as blue-violet, Aeromonas<br>
colonies show as red-pink, and Salmonella colonies show as teal-green. While<br>
the individual shades of these colors may vary somewhat in the test medium<br>
due to factors such as varying enzyme production of the biological entities, it<br>
has been found that these four colors are distinct enough so that confusion<br>
amongst them is unlikely.<br>
The colonies of each type of microorganism may be enumerated by<br>
counting the colonies or by other methods known in the art for enumerating<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
27<br>
microorganisms on a test plate. The number of colonies of each type generally<br>
indicates the number of microorganisms of each type originally present in the<br>
sample before incubation.<br>
Optional Ingredients<br>
Inhibitors<br>
The method of the present invention does not require inhibitors.<br>
However, the medium may be made more selective for general coliforms and<br>
E. coli if desired by the addition of various compounds that are inhibitory to<br>
the general microbial population, but have little or no effect on coliforms.<br>
Following are some compounds which may be used: a) bile salts, about 0.3<br>
g/liter, b) sodium lauryl sulfate, about 0.2 g/liter, c) sodium desoxycholate,<br>
about 0.2 g/liter, d) Tergitol 7, about 0.1 ml/liter. The use of one or more of<br>
these compounds reduces the background (non-coliform) microorganism<br>
presence and makes a less cluttered plate and eliminates the possibility of<br>
inhibition or interference by the non-coliform organisms in the sample. The<br>
use of certain antibiotics may accomplish the same result.<br>
Cefsulodin is commonly used in currently available test media to<br>
inhibit Aeromonas spp. However, the use of cefsulodin as an inhibitor<br>
requires an extra step in the process, viz., sterile addition of filter sterilized<br>
antibiotic. This step is difficult to control. Further, the presence of cefsulodin<br>
significantly reduces the effective shelf life of the medium. It has been found<br>
that Nalidixic acid can be used instead of Cefsulodin to inhibit Aeromonas<br>
spp. with about the same efficacy. Nalidixic acid is preferable because it can<br>
survive the approximately 120 °C temperature reached in autoclaving the test<br>
media. Therefore, unlike cefsulodin, nalidixic acid can be added to the test<br>
media as part of the initial media formulation prior to sterilization {see,<br>
preparation of test medium, above). It also follows that the resistance of the<br>
nalidixic acid to unfavorable environmental conditions will result in a longer<br>
shelf life for a medium containing it as compared to cefsulodin.<br>
Inducers<br>
It is possible that the enzyme production of the general coliforms may<br>
be enhanced by the addition to the medium formulations of very small<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
28<br>
amounts of substances known as enzyme inducers. One specific inducer for β-<br>
galactosidase is available and is known chemically as isopropyl-β-<br>
thiogalactopyranoside. Adding approximately 100 mg/liter of medium has a<br>
positive and noticeable effect on the speed of enzyme production for some<br>
species of coliforms. Other enzyme inducers are available and may be added<br>
to media formulations if enhanced enzyme production is deemed helpful.<br>
Examples<br>
Listed below are broad examples of test media enzyme substrate<br>
combinations to be used in combination with the nutrient formula discussed<br>
above or other suitable nutrient formulas which may be prepared in practicing<br>
the present invention.<br>
Table III illustrates the flexibility of the preferred embodiments<br>
incorporating the present invention. Table III is a matrix of some of the<br>
possible four-color combinations available for the preferred biological entities<br>
E. coli, general coliforms, and at least one of the genera Aeromonas or<br>
Salmonella to be detected by using the teachings of this disclosure. Other<br>
color combinations are possible. In many cases, a plurality of different<br>
substrates will achieve a desired result, the only difference being the colors<br>
detected for a specific enzyme. The preferred color choice for the detection of<br>
E. coli is denoted with an asterisk in Table III, depending on the colors chosen<br>
to detect other microorganisms. As discussed above, other chromogenic<br>
substrates do not interfere with the substantially black color, and the<br>
substantially black color is easy to distinguish from the other colors.<br>
As discussed above, the use of Table III requires taking into account<br>
the combined color effect discussed above which is produced by the inclusion<br>
of multiple chromogenic substrates in a single medium. For example, with<br>
reference to the first entry in Table III, it can be understood that general<br>
coliforms will appear as a combination of (1) red-pink (magenta) and (2) teal,<br>
the resulting color being blue-violet. This is the case because general<br>
coliforms are responsive to two chromogenic substrates. Similarly, general<br>
coliforms will show in a test medium in accordance with the second entry of<br>
Table III as a combination of (1) red-pink (magenta) and (2) yellow.<br><br>

Table IV is a partial list of enzyme patterns for biological entities<br>
preferred to be to be detected in accordance with the teachings of this<br>
disclosure. It is to be understood that one of ordinary skill in the art would<br>
readily recognized that other enzymes which are known and have been<br>
produced, and enzymes which are known only on a theoretically level, would<br>
also perform satisfactorily.<br>
Table IV<br><br>
Table V is a matrix which teaches a wide variety of substrates and their<br>
associated colors for use in test media in accordance with the teachings of this<br>
disclosure. The left hand side of Table V indicates the color that will result<br>
when the listed chromogenic component is cleaved from its corresponding<br>
substrate by the specific enzyme for that substrate. In the case of the<br>
nonchromogenic components, the color is substantially black and the reaction<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
31<br>
mechanism requires the presence of ions of a salt upon cleavage of the<br>
substrate, as explained above.<br>
Test enzymes which are produced by certain biological entities {see<br>
Table IV) are found at the right hand side of table V. "Substrate components"<br>
are shown to the left of the specific test enzymes. Each of the substrate<br>
components listed on the right hand side of table V can be combined with any<br>
of the chromogenic or nonchromogenic components listed on the left hand<br>
side of table V to identify a specific substrate for use in a test medium. It can<br>
therefore be understood that Table V teaches a large quantity of substrates<br>
possible for use in accordance with the present invention. Many of the<br>
substrates identified by the above-described use of table V are commercially<br>
available, whereas the method for producing other identified substrates is<br>
described in the literature. Still other substrates identified by using table V are<br>
only theoretically possible.<br>
Nonchromogenic components are included at the bottom left hand side<br>
of Table V, and are different from the chromogenic components because they<br>
do not form specific colors upon cleavage. Instead, the quinoline or esculetin<br>
components combine with ions of a salt {e.g., ferric salt) which must be<br>
present in the medium when the substrate is cleaved by the specific enzyme.<br>
The substantially black precipitate formed by the nonchromogenic<br>
components is a combination of the quinoline or esculetin - iron complex<br>
rather than a dimer which is formed by the chromogenic components.<br>
Unlike nonchromogenic components, the chromogenic components<br>
should be selected in view of all other chromogenic components selected for<br>
the medium and in view of the enzyme patterns of the entities to be detected.<br>
The selection and concentration of chromogenic components should maximize<br>
the distinction among the respective colors produced.<br>
While many various chromogenic component and substrate<br>
component/enzyme possibilities are taught by Table V, other possibilities<br>
within the scope of the appended claims would be possible by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. For example, as shown in Table V, one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art could combine an N-acetyl group with many of the sugars of the substrate<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
32<br>
components listed in Table V. For example, an N-acetyl group could be<br>
combined with P-D-mannopyranoside to form N-acetyl- β-D-mannosaminide,<br>
the corresponding enzyme being N-acetyl-β-D-mannosaminidase. Any of the<br>
chromogenic components or nonchromogenic components listed on the left<br>
hand side of Table V could then be combined with the substrate component to<br>
identify a substrate. If the substrate is commercially available or the method<br>
of making it is known, the substrate could be used in a test medium. Upon<br>
cleavage of the substrate by the corresponding enzyme in the test medium, the<br>
color listed will appear.<br>
Generally, the teachings of this disclosure can be used as follows to<br>
make a test medium for detecting various microorganisms or cell types. First,<br>
the microorganisms desired to be detected and differentiated are selected. The<br>
preferred organisms to be detected are E. coli, general coliforms, and at least<br>
one of the genera Aeromonas or Salmonella. Enzymes produced by the<br>
selected organisms can be identified with reference to Table IV. Equipped<br>
with knowledge of specific enzymes produced by each microorganism, one<br>
can then identify corresponding substrates components from the right hand<br>
side of Table V. Depending upon the color desired, one can select a<br>
chromogenic or nonchromogenic component from Table V to be combined<br>
with the substrate component to identify a substrate for inclusion in the test<br>
medium. If the substrate thereby identified is commercially available or the<br>
method of its synthesis is known, the substrate can be used in the test medium.<br><br>

Example I<br>
The microorganisms chosen to be identified, quantified and<br>
differentiated are E. coli, general coliforms, Aeromonas and/or Salmonella.<br>
With reference to Table IV, E. coli produces the enzyme Bgluc, and<br>
 Bgluc is not produced by any of the other microorganisms desired to be<br>
detected. With reference to the right hand side of Table V, it can be seen that<br>
the test enzyme Bgluc has a corresponding substrate component of β-D-<br>
glucuronide. Thus, a chromogenic or nonchromogenic component which<br>
produces a distinct color upon cleavage of Bgluc should be chosen from the<br>
left hand side of Table V. 8-hydroxyquinoline is chosen for its preferred<br>
substantially black color. The first identified substrate is therefore 8-<br>
hydroxyquinoline-β-D-glucuronide, the availability of which is described<br>
above. A metallic salt such as ferric ammonium citrate is also required and is<br>
added to the test medium so that, upon cleavage of the substrate by Bgluc, a<br>
substantially black water-insoluble complex forms in the medium. The<br>
substantially black precipitate consists of the ferric ions and the aglycone<br>
released when the substrate is hydrolyzed by the glucuronidase from E. coli.<br>
With further reference to Table IV, Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are common<br>
to Aeromonas and general coliforms. However, as indicated in Table IV,<br>
Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are not produced generally by Salmonella. Therefore, a<br>
substrate component corresponding to one of Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu can be<br>
selected form the right hand side of Table V. Bgal and the associated<br>
substrate component β-D-galactopyranoside are chosen. The 6-chloro-3-<br>
indolyl- chromogenic component produces a red-pink color upon cleavage<br>
from its substrate in the presence of Bgal and is selected as the chromogenic<br>
component. The second substrate is therefore 6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
39<br>
Again referring to Table IV, Bman, Aara and Agal are common to<br>
Salmonella and general coliforms. However, as indicated in Table IV, Bman,<br>
Aara and Agal are not produced by Aeromonas. Thus, one of Bman, Aara and<br>
Agal can be chosen and its associated substrate component identified with<br>
reference to Table V. The test enzyme Agal and the respective substrate<br>
component α-D-galactopyranoside are chosen. Next, a chromogenic<br>
component must be selected from Table V. As shown on the left hand side of<br>
Table V, the cliromogenic component 5-bromo-4-chloro~3-indolyl produces a<br>
teal color upon cleavage from its associated substrate and is therefore selected.<br>
The third substrate is therefore 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside.<br>
General coliforms have a wide enzyme pattern which is responsive to<br>
both the 6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside substrate and the 5-bromo-<br>
4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside substrate. Therefore, general<br>
coliforms will show as a fourth distinct color which is a combination of the<br>
colors produced by the two aforementioned substrates, respectively. In this<br>
case the fourth color will be violet-blue, which is a combination of red-pink<br>
and teal.<br>
Finally, as seen in Table IV, E. coli also exhibits a wide enzyme<br>
pattern and responsive to all three of the substrates chosen in this example,<br>
viz., 8-hydroxyquinoline-P-D-glucuronide,	6-chloro-3-indolyl-[i-D-<br>
galactopyranoside, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-oc-D-galactopyranoside.<br>
Nonetheless, E. coli colonies present in the test medium will show as a<br>
substantially black color because, as discussed above, the chromogenic<br>
substrates do not interfere with the substantially black color. Advantageously,<br>
this substantially black color provides a superior means for distinguishing the<br>
E. coli, as well as allows four separate microorganisms to be detected,<br>
quantified, differentiated and identified in a single test medium. See Table VI.<br>
Example II<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified, differentiated<br>
and identified are E. coli as a first color; general coliforms and Salmonella as a<br>
second color; and Aeromonas as a third color.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
40<br>
With reference to Table IV, E. coli produces the enzyme Bglue, and<br>
Bgluc is not produced by any of the other microorganisms desired to be<br>
detected. With reference to the right hand side of Table V, it can be seen that<br>
the test enzyme Bgluc has a corresponding substrate component of P-D-<br>
glucuronide. Thus, a chromogenic or nonchromogenic component which<br>
produces a distinct color upon cleavage of Bgluc should be chosen from the<br>
left hand side of Table V. 8-hydroxyquinoline is chosen for its preferred<br>
substantially black color. The first identified substrate is therefore 8-<br>
hydroxyquinoline-p-D-glucuronide, the availability of which is described<br>
above. A metallic salt such as ferric ammonium citrate is also required and is<br>
added to the test medium so that, upon cleavage of the substrate by Bgluc, a<br>
substantially black water-insoluble complex forms in the medium. The<br>
substantially black precipitate consists of the ferric ions and the aglycone<br>
released when the substrate is hydrolized by the glucuronidase from E. coli.<br>
With further reference to Table IV, Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are common<br>
to Aeromonas and general coliforms. However, as indicated in Table IV,<br>
Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are not produced by Salmonella. Using Table V in the<br>
fashion described above, 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside is<br>
selected as the second substrate, which will produce a red-pink color upon<br>
cleavage as indicated by the chromogenic component list of Table V.<br>
As seen in Table IV, the enzyme Bman is common to Salmonella but<br>
not Aeromonas. From table V, the substrate component associated with Bman<br>
is β-D-mannopyranoside. In this example, it is desired to also produce the<br>
second distinct color (red-pink) with Salmonella so that, ultimately,<br>
Salmonella colonies present in the test medium will show as the same color as<br>
general coliforms present in the test medium. Thus, the chromogenic<br>
component is 6-Chloro-3-indolyl- and the third substrate is therefore 6-<br>
Chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-mannopyranoside.<br>
In this example, again using Table V, a fourth substrate is identified<br>
that will be cleaved by one of the enzymes Bman, Aara, Agal common to<br>
Salmonella to produce a third distinct color. Using table V in the fashion<br>
described above, the fourth substrate selected is 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
41<br>
a-D-galactopyranoside, which produces a teal-green color in the presence of<br>
Agal common to Salmonella.<br>
The resulting colors of colonies present in the test medium can be<br>
predicted as follows. E. coli exhibits a wide enzyme pattern that is positive for<br>
all four of the substrates chosen in this example, including the 8-hydroxy-<br>
glucuronide substrate which produces a substantially black color upon<br>
cleavage in the presence of the ions of the ferric salt. E. coli colonies show as<br>
substantially black. Aeromonas has an enzyme pattern which reacts with only<br>
the 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside substrate chosen in this<br>
example and therefore colonies of Aeromonas show as red-pink. Salmonella<br>
has an enzyme pattern which cleaves both the third and fourth substrates<br>
selected in this example and therefore colonies of Salmonella show as purple-<br>
blue (a combination of teal and red-pink). Finally, general coliforms are<br>
positive for each of the second, third and fourth substrates selected and<br>
colonies thereof show as purple-blue, indistinguishable from the Salmonella<br>
colonies. As discussed above, different strains of all species of the various<br>
genera will not all produce the same amounts of the various enzymes, so there<br>
may be slight variations in shades of purple-blue, for example.<br>
Example IIIA<br>
The selected microorganisms to be quantified and differentiated in this<br>
example are E. coli as a first color, general coliforms and Aeromonas as a<br>
second color, and Salmonella as a third color.<br>
With reference to Table IV, E. coli produces the enzyme Bgluc, and<br>
Bgluc is not produced by any of the other microorganisms desired to be<br>
detected. With reference to the right hand side of Table V, it can be seen that<br>
the test enzyme Bgluc has a corresponding substrate component of β-D-<br>
glucuronide. Thus, a chromogenic or nonchromogenic component which<br>
produces a distinct color upon cleavage of Bgluc should be chosen from the<br>
left hand side of Table V. 8-hydroxyquinoline is chosen for its preferred<br>
substantially black color. The first identified substrate is therefore 8-<br>
hydroxyquinoline-β-D-glucuronide, the availability of which is described<br>
above. A metallic salt such as ferric ammonium citrate is also required and is<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
42<br>
added to the test medium so that, upon cleavage of the substrate by Bgluc, a<br>
substantially black water-insoluble complex forms in the medium. The<br>
substantially black precipitate consists of the ferric ions and the aglycone<br>
released when the substrate is hydrolized by the glucuronidase from E. coli.<br>
Using tables IV and V in a fashion similar to that described above with<br>
reference to Examples I and II, 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside is<br>
selected as a second substrate to combine with one of the enzymes Bgal, Bfuc<br>
and Bglu common to coliforms and Aeromonas, but negative for Salmonella to<br>
produce a second distinct color, in this case substantially red-pink.<br>
Similarly, 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside is selected as a<br>
third substrate to combine with Agal, which is common to coliforms and<br>
Salmonella, but negative for Aeromonas. Upon reaction with the enzyme, this<br>
substrate will also produce the same distinct second color, namely red-pink.<br>
5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside is selected as a<br>
fourth substrate to combine with the enzyme Bgal, which is common to<br>
coliforms and Aeromonas, but negative for Salmonella. This fourth substrate<br>
produces a teal-green color upon reaction with Bgal.<br>
The resulting colors of colonies present in the test medium can be<br>
predicted as follows. E. coli exhibits a wide enzyme pattern and is positive for<br>
all four of the substrates chosen in this example. Therefore, E. coli colonies<br>
will show as substantially black. General coliform colonies have an enzyme<br>
pattern which is positive for the second, third and fourth substrates, so that<br>
general coliforms colonies show as purple-blue. Aeromonas colonies have an<br>
enzyme pattern which is positive for the second and fourth substrates chosen<br>
so that Aeromonas colonies also show as purple-blue. Finally, the enzymes<br>
common to Salmonella are only positive for the third of the four substrates, so<br>
that Salmonella colonies show as red-pink.<br>
Example IIIB<br>
As a variation, the test medium of Example IIIA can be prepared such<br>
that colonies of Salmonella will show as teal instead of pink-red, all of the<br>
other colony colors being the same as Example IIIA. With reference to Table<br>
VI, such can be accomplished by replacing the 6-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
43<br>
galactopyranoside of Example IIIA with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside.<br>
Example HIC<br>
A second, independent method for producing the same three colors as<br>
Example IIIA for the same four components can be achieved by adding<br>
nalidixic acid or other antibiotics or inhibitors of Aeromonas to the<br>
components listed in Example 1. In so doing, the cefsulodin or nalidixic acid<br>
or other substance acts as an inhibitor for Aeromonas so Aeromonas colonies<br>
do not grow. If Aeromonas is eliminated, then the purple-blue colonies are all<br>
true coliforms. If not eliminated, any A eromonas will be counted as part of<br>
the coliforms which some persons may prefer since Aeromonas is an<br>
important indicator organism.<br>
Example IV<br>
In this example, the selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified<br>
and differentiated are E. coli, coliforms and Salmonella as a first distinct color<br>
and Aeromonas as a second distinct color. One test medium which achieves<br>
this result is the test medium described in Example II, except that the first<br>
substrate and metallic salt are omitted. Thus, because the enzyme pattern of E.<br>
coli reacts with the same substrates as the enzyme pattern for general<br>
coliforms, E. coli and general coliforms will be the same color in this test<br>
medium. Specifically, E. coli, coliforms and Salmonella colonies will show as<br>
a purple-blue color, whereas Aeromonas colonies will show as a substantially<br>
red-pink color.<br>
Example V<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated are E. coli, general coliforms and Aeromonas as a first distinct<br>
color, and Salmonella as a second distinct color. One test medium which<br>
achieves this result is the test medium of Example 3 with the first substrate<br>
and metallic salt being omitted. In this test medium, E. coli, general coliforms<br>
and Aeromonas colonies will show as a generally purple-blue color, whereas<br>
Salmonella colonies will show as a generally teal-green color or as a red-pink<br>
color.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
44<br>
Optionally, the 6-chloro-S-indolyl-α-D-galactoside can be replaced<br>
with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside so that Salmonella colonies<br>
show as teal, rather than pink.<br>
A third way to achieve the same result is with an antibiotic, preferably<br>
nalidixic acid, to inhibit the growth of Aeromonas colonies. If Aeromonas is<br>
eliminated, then the purple-blue colonies are all true coliforms. If not<br>
eliminated, any Aeromonas will be counted as part of the coliforms which<br>
some persons may prefer since Aeromonas is an important indicator organism.<br>
Example VI<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated are E. coli and coliforms as a first distinct color, Aeromonas as a<br>
second distinct color and Salmonella as a third distinct color. A test medium<br>
which achieves this result is the test medium of Example I with the first<br>
substrate and metallic salt being omitted. In such a test medium, E. coli and<br>
general coliform colonies will show as purple-blue, Aeromonas colonies will<br>
show as generally red-pink, and Salmonella colonies will show as generally<br>
teal-green.<br>
Example VII<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated are E. coli as a first distinct color which is substantially black;<br>
general coliforms as a second distinct color which is substantially purple-blue;<br>
Aeromonas/Vibrio/Plesiomonas as a third distinct color which is substantially<br>
red-pink; and Salmonella as a fourth distinct color which is substantially teal-<br>
green.<br>
With reference to Table IV, E. coli produces the enzyme Bgluc, and<br>
Bgluc is not produced by any of the other microorganisms desired to be<br>
detected. Therefore, a substrate which produces a distinct color upon cleavage<br>
of Bgluc should be chosen from Table V. 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-<br>
glucuronide produces a substantially black color in the presence of Bgluc and<br>
would be the preferred choice of substrate, as explained below. A metallic salt<br>
such as ferric ammonium citrate is also added to form a substantially black<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
45<br>
water insoluble complex consisting of the ferric ions and the aglycone released<br>
when the substrate is hydrolyzed by the glucuronidase from E. coli.<br>
With further reference to Table IV, it can be seen that the enzyme Ngal<br>
and Naglu are common to the microorganisms Aeromonas, Plesiomonas , and<br>
Vibrios. Therefore, a suitable substrate for testing all of these microorganisms<br>
as a single distinct color is 6-chloro-S-indolyl-N-acetyl-β-D-galactosaminide,<br>
which produces a substantially red-pink color in the presence of these<br>
enzymes.<br>
Again referring to Table IV, Bman, Aara and Agal are common to<br>
Salmonella and general coliforms. However, as indicated in Table IV, Bman,<br>
Aara and Agal are not produced by Aeromonas. Therefore, a substrate can be<br>
selected from Table V which reacts with one of Bman, Aara and Agal to<br>
produce a third distinct color. As shown in Table V, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-<br>
indolyl-α-D-galactoside produces a teal-green color in the presence of Agal<br>
and is therefore selected as a substrate.<br>
In this test medium E. coli colonies will show as substantially black,<br>
general coliform colonies will show as substantially purple-blue, Aeromonas,<br>
Vibrio and Plesiomonas colonies will show as substantially red-pink, and<br>
Salmonella colonies will show as substantially teal.<br>
Example VIII<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated are E. coli as a first distinct color; coliforms and Salmonella as a<br>
second distinct color; and Aeromonas, Vibrio and Plesiomonas as a third<br>
distinct color. One test medium for achieving this result is the test medium of<br>
Example 2, except that the fourth substrate chosen is 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-N-<br>
acetyl-α-D-galactosaminide, to which each of the microorganisms<br>
Plesiomonas, Vibrios and Aeromonas are responsive so that each of these<br>
colonies shows as a generally red-pink color.<br>
Example IX<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are E. coli and general coliforms as a first<br>
distinct color which is purple-blue; Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, and Vibrios as a<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
46<br>
second distinct color which is red-pink; and Salmonella as a third distinct<br>
color which is teal-green. This result can be achieved with the test medium as<br>
described in Example 6 with the addition of 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-N-acetyl- β-D-<br>
galactosaminide, to which each of the microorganisms Plesiomonas, Vibrio<br>
and Aeromonas is responsive.<br>
Example X<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are E. coli and general coliforms as a first color;<br>
Aeromonas, Vibrio and Plesiomonas as a second distinct color; and<br>
Salmonella as a third distinct color. A suitable test medium that achieves this<br>
result is the test medium disclosed in Example 7 except that the first substrate<br>
for detecting E. coli colonies is omitted. In this example, E. coli and general<br>
coliform colonies show as generally purple-blue, Aeromonas, Vibrio and<br>
Plesiomonas show as generally red-pink, and Salmonella show as generally<br>
teal-green. The addition of 6-Chloro-3-indolyl-P-D-galactopyranoside is<br>
necessary to yield the purple-blue color for E. coli colonies.<br>
Example XI<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are E. coli as a substantially black color and<br>
general coliforms as a red-pink color. With reference to Table IV, E.<br>
coli produces the enzyme Bgluc, and Bgluc is not produced by any of the<br>
other microorganisms desired to be detected. Therefore, a substrate which<br>
produces a distinct color upon cleavage of Bgluc should be chosen from Table<br>
V. 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-glucuronide produces a dark color in the presence<br>
of Bgluc and would be the preferred choice of substrate. A metallic salt such<br>
as ferric ammonium citrate is also added to form a black water insoluble<br>
complex consisting of ferric ions and the aglycone released when the substrate<br>
is hydrolized by glucuronidase from E. coli.<br>
With further reference to Table IV, Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are common<br>
to Aeromonas and general coliforms. However, as indicated in Table IV,<br>
Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are not generally produced by Salmonella. Therefore, a<br>
substrate can be selected from Table V which reacts with one of Bgal, Bfuc<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
47<br>
and Bglu to produce a second distinct color. 6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside produces a pink color in the presence of Bgal and is<br>
selected as the second substrate.<br>
Optionally, the 6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside can be<br>
replaced with S-bromo-β-chloro-S-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside so that<br>
Aeromonas and general coliform colonies show as teal instead of pink.<br>
As noted, the second substrate selected will result in colonies of<br>
Aeromonas also showing as a generally red-pink color. To avoid growth of<br>
Aeromonas colonies, an inhibitor, preferably nalidixic acid, is added. Thus,<br>
colonies of E. coli will show as substantially black, whereas colonies of<br>
general coliforms will show as a red-pink color.<br>
Example XII<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are E. coli, general coliforms and Aeromonas<br>
spp. as a substantially black color and Salmonella spp. as a second distinct<br>
color. The first substrate selected is 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-galactoside,<br>
which results in colonies of E. coli, general coliforms and Aeromonas showing<br>
as substantially black. The second substrate chosen can be either 5-Bromo-4-<br>
chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside or 6-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside. If the former of these two substrates is chosen, colonies of<br>
Salmonella will show as a teal color, whereas if the latter of the two<br>
aforementioned substrates is chosen, colonies of Salmonella will show as a<br>
red-pink color.<br>
Optionally, in this example, Aeromonas may be eliminated by adding<br>
an inhibitor, preferably nalidixic acid, as discussed in detail above.<br>
Example XIII<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are the same as in Example 1, except that this<br>
example illustrates a correction for false positives. That is, it is possible that<br>
certain unusual Enterobacter and Klebsiella spp. will show as black colonies<br>
along with E. coli in the test medium disclosed in Example 1. Thus, the count<br>
of E. coli could be inaccurately high.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
48<br>
In this example, 4-methyl-umbrelliferyl-β-D-xylopyranoside is added<br>
to the test medium described in Example 1. In so doing, Enterobacter and<br>
Klebsiella spp. showing as black colonies will also fluoresce, thereby allowing<br>
reduction in the false positive count of E. coli. This example illustrates the<br>
flexibility of embodiments incorporating the present invention. The<br>
fluoroescent component does not interfere with the substantially black color so<br>
that the black colonies are easily distinguished with the naked eye. Yet, under<br>
ultraviolet light, false positives can be detected and substantially reduced by<br>
examining the black colonies for fluorescence.<br>
Example XIV<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified, differentiated<br>
and identified are E. coli as a substantially black color and Salmonella spp. as<br>
pink-red. General coliforms are colorless in this example.<br>
With reference to Example I, E.Coli is responsive to 8-hydroxy-<br>
quinoline- β-D-glucuronide. General coliforms, Salmonella and Aeromonas<br>
are not responsive to 8-hydroxy-quinoline- β-D-glucuronide. Thus, the first<br>
substrate chosen is 8-hydroxy-quinoline- β-D-glucuronide.<br>
With reference to table IV, esterase enzyme is positive for Salmonella<br>
spp., but not any of the other preferred microorganisms to be detected. With<br>
reference to table V, the substrate 6-chloro-3-indolyl-caprylate can be<br>
identified, and will produce a pink-red color upon cleavage, and is therefore<br>
chosen as the second substrate.<br>
In this test medium, colonies of E. coli will show as substantially<br>
black and colonies of Salmonella will show as pink-red.<br>
Example XV<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified, differentiated<br>
and identified are E. coli as a substantially black color, Salmonella spp. as<br>
dark blue-purple, and general coliforms as red-pink.<br>
With reference to Example I, E. coli is responsive to 8-hydroxy-<br>
quinoline- β-D-glucuronide. General coliforms, Salmonella and Aeromonas<br>
are not responsive to 8-hydroxy-quinoline-β-D-glucuronide. Thus, the first<br>
substrate chosen is 8-hydroxy-quinoline- β-D-glucuronide.<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
49<br>
With reference to tables IV and V, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-<br>
caprylate can be identified as the second substrate to which Salmonella will be<br>
responsive. With further reference to Table V, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-<br>
caprylate forms a teal color upon cleavage.<br>
6-chloro-S-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside, which produces a pink-red<br>
color upon cleavage, is chosen as the third substrate to which E.coli general<br>
coliforms and Salmonella are responsive.<br>
In this example, E. coli colonies show as substantially black, general<br>
coliform colonies show as red-pink, and Salmonella show as blue-violet (=<br>
red-pink + teal).<br>
Example XVI<br>
The selected microorganisms to be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are E. coli as a substantially black color and<br>
general coliforms as a second distinct color.<br>
With reference to Table IV, E. coli produces the enzyme Bgluc, and<br>
Bgluc is not produced by any of the other microorganisms desired to be<br>
detected. Therefore, a substrate which produces a distinct color upon cleavage<br>
of Bgluc should be chosen from Table V. 8-hydroxyquinoline-β-D-<br>
glucuronide produces a dark color in the presence of Bgluc and would be the<br>
preferred choice of substrate. A metallic salt such as ferric ammonium citrate<br>
is also added to form a black water insoluble complex consisting of ferric ions<br>
and the aglycone released when the substrate is hydrolized by glucuronidase<br>
from E. coli.<br>
With further reference to Table IV, Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are common<br>
to Aeromonas and general coliforms. However, as indicated in Table IV,<br>
Bgal, Bfuc and Bglu are not generally produced by Salmonella. Therefore, a<br>
substrate can be selected from Table V which reacts with one of Bgal, Bfuc<br>
and Bglu to produce a second distinct color. 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside can be chosen as the second substrate, in which event<br>
colonies of E. coli will appear as substantially black and general colifom<br>
colonies will appear as teal. Optionally, 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl-<br>
galactopyranoside can be chosen as the second substrate, in which event<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
50<br>
colonies of E. coli will appear as substantially black and general colifom<br>
colonies will appear magenta. To avoid growth of Aeromonas colonies, an<br>
inhibitor, preferably nalidixic acid, is added. Thus, colonies of E. coli will<br>
show as substantially black, whereas colonies of general coliforms will show<br>
as a magenta color.<br>
Example XVII<br>
Some selected micro-organisms that can be detected, quantified and<br>
differentiated in this example are E. coli, general coliforms, Aeromonas,<br>
and/or Salmonella. The substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- β-D-<br>
glucuronide, 6-chloro-3-indolyl- β-D-galactopyranoside, and 5-bromo-4-<br>
chloro-3-indolyl- α-D-galactopyranoside are added in quantities of<br>
approximately 125 mg/1 medium; 200 mg/1 medium; and 65 mg/1 medium,<br>
respectively. The remaining preparation and inoculation of the test medium in<br>
this example is similar to that discussed above, except that ions of salt are not<br>
required when the medium does not have a nonchromogenic substrate. In this<br>
medium, E.coli, which reacts with all of the substrates, will appear as a very<br>
dark blue and/or purple color because the high concentration of the P-D-<br>
glucuronide will predominate. The general coliforms, which react to both the<br>
α- and β-D-galactopyranoside appear as a light blue-gray color. Salmonella,<br>
which reacts with the a-D-galactopyranoside will have a teal color and<br>
Aeromonas, which reacts with β-D-galactopyranoside will have a pink-red<br>
color. It can be beneficial if the concentration/amount used of the β-D-<br>
glucuronide is greater than the β-D-galactopyranoside to increase the<br>
difference in coloration/darkness between the E. coli and general coliforms,<br>
since these substrates utilize the same color compound in this example.<br>
However, even if the same amounts of β-D-glucuronide and β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside are used, the E. coli may still be darker and distinguishable<br>
from general coliforms since it reacts to both of these substrates whereas the<br>
general coliforms do not react with the β-D-glucuronide.<br>
Example XVIII<br>
An alternate β-D-glucuronide substrate that may be utilized is 5-iodo-<br>
3-indolyl- β-D-glucuronide, which is commonly known as Iodo-Gluc. Selected<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
51<br>
micro-organisms to be detected, quantified and differentiated in this example<br>
are E. coli, general coliforms, Aeromonas, and Salmonella. The concentration<br>
of the β-D-glucuronide must be sufficient to provide a very dark purple color<br>
that can be readily distinguished from the blue-gray color of the general<br>
coliforms.<br>
Example XIX<br>
Another alternate β-D-glucuronide substrate that may be used is<br>
indoxyl-β-D-glucuronide, which is commonly known as IBDG. With a<br>
sufficient concentration of IBDG, E. coli will appear darker than the other<br>
colonies as a dark blue-purple color. General coliforms, Salmonella, and<br>
Aeromonas will appear as light blue-gray, teal and red-pink, respectively.<br>
Example XX<br>
In this example, 4-methylumbelliferyl- β-D-glucuronide, commonly<br>
known as MUGluc, is used instead of a chromogenic or nonchromogenic β-D-<br>
glucuronide. With this medium, E. coli will be light blue-gray and fluoresce<br>
 under ultraviolet light, and general coliforms will be light blue-gray,<br>
Salmonella will be teal, and Aeromonas will be pink-red in ambient light. An<br>
advantage of the MUGluc is that the incubation times required for detection of<br>
the colonies may be substantially less than that required with the other<br>
chromogenic or nonchromogenic substrates. An incubation time of about 14<br>
hours should be sufficient to detect E. coli with this substrate. A disadvantage<br>
is that the fluorescent products are more readily diffusible than the other<br>
compounds and may make it more difficult to quantify the E. coli. However,<br>
even if the E. coli can not be quantified in a given test, it will still certainly be<br>
suitable for a presence/absence test for E. coli.<br>
Example XXI<br>
In this medium, a 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide (MUGluc) is<br>
combined with one of the other previously mentioned chromogenic or<br>
nonchromogenic glucuronide substrates as well as with chromogenic α- and β-<br>
D-galactopyranosides. This medium offers the advantage that a<br>
presence/absence test for E. coli may be performed with shorter incubation<br>
times than required for the chromogenic and nonchromogenic substrates. In<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
52<br>
addition, if for any reason, it is uncertain whether colonies of detected<br>
organisms are E. coli or general coliforms, the medium can be examined under<br>
ultraviolet light so that colonies of E. coli can be confirmed by fluorescence.<br>
This provides a double check on the accuracy of the identity of the colonies.<br>
Example XXII<br>
In this example, one of the previously mentioned chromogenic or<br>
nonchromogenic β-D-glucuronide substrates is combined with a chromogenic<br>
β-D-galactopyranoside and a chromogenic β-D-galactopyranoside. In<br>
addition, the medium includes a 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-galactopyranoside.<br>
The glucuronide substrate in one example is a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-<br>
D chromogenic glucuronide. The medium also includes a 6-chloro-3-indolyl-<br>
β-D-galactopyranoside and a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside. This medium offers the advantage that any organisms that<br>
react with an α-D-galactopyranoside will fluoresce under ultraviolet light.<br>
Additionally, the fluorescent results tend to show up faster than any results<br>
having a positive reaction to the chromogenic or nonchromogenic substrates.<br>
Accordingly, E. coli, general coliforms, and Salmonella, which all react to α-<br>
D-galactopyranoside, will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. In addition, when<br>
the reactions with the chromogenic substrates have had sufficient time, that E.<br>
coli will be a very dark blue due to a reaction to both the glucuronide and α-D-<br>
galactoside teal substrates and the pink β-D-galactoside substrate. Coliforms<br>
will show as a lighter blue than E. coli due to a combination of the teal α-D-<br>
galactoside substrate and pink β-D-galactoside substrate. Aeromonas will be a<br>
pink color in response to the reaction with the β-D-galactoside substrate and<br>
Salmonella will be a teal color in response to the reaction with the α-D-<br>
galactoside substrate.<br>
Example XXIII<br>
This example uses chromogenic substrates of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-<br>
indolyl-β-D-glucuronide; 6-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside; and 5-<br>
bromo-4-chloro-3- indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside. However, instead of 4-<br>
methylumbelliferyl-α-D-galactopyranoside, a 4-methylumbelliferyl- β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside is used. Under ambient light, E. coli, general coliforms,<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
53<br>
Aeromonas and Salmonella will have the same colors as in Example XXII. In<br>
addition, E. coli and general coliforms will still fluoresce, as both will react to<br>
the β-D-galactoside substrate; however, in this instance, Aeromonas will also<br>
fluoresce under ultraviolet light because of the presence of the β-D-<br>
galactosidase activity. Salmonella, however, will not fluoresce as it is<br>
negative for β-D-galactopyranoside.<br>
In Examples XXII and XXIII, the same chromogenic color component<br>
is used in the β-D-glucuronide and the α-D-galactopyranoside. The same<br>
amount of color component may be used in each substrate, and the E. coli will<br>
still appear as a darker blue than general coliforms as the products formed in<br>
the presence of E. coli result from both the β-D-glucuronide and the α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside, which both produce a teal color, as well as the β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside, which produces a pink color, while coliforms only react<br>
with the a- and β-D-galactopyranosides. It is also possible to increase the<br>
amount of the color component in the β-D-glucuronide as compared to the α-<br>
D-galactopyranoside, so that the E. coli will appear even darker, making the E.<br>
coli more readily distinguishable from general coliforms. Furthermore, as<br>
another alternative, a nonchromogenic substrate such as 8-hydroxyquinolin<br>
plus ions may be used for the β-D-glucuronide instead of a chromogenic<br>
substrate as in other examples above.<br>
Example XXIV<br>
In this example, a 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide commonly<br>
known as MUGluc is used in combination with a chromogenic or<br>
nonchromogenic β-D- glucuronide substrate. For example, a 5-bromo-4-<br>
chloiO-3-indolyl-β-D-glucuronide substrate may be used. This medium<br>
provides the ability to perform a double validation of positive results for<br>
E. coli in a single test. In addition, the method provides a means of<br>
performing an initial check for E. coli under ultraviolet light as E. coli, which<br>
react with β-D-glucuronide will fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light. In<br>
addition, the E. coli will also react with the chromogenic substrate and be seen<br>
as a teal color under ambient light. The MUGluc results will likely be<br>
available before the results with a chromogenic substrate for an initial<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
54<br>
examination, and the follow-up examination of the medium for the presence of<br>
teal colonies will confirm the presence of E coli, and allow for quantifying the<br>
colonies. This method offers a significant advantage over other current<br>
verification tests for checking for E. coli, such as a test for checking for the<br>
presence of tryptophanase, which is also unique to E. coli and not generally<br>
present in other coliforms. However, there is no current way to incorporate<br>
the test for both tryptophanase and glucuronide in the same medium so that the<br>
check for tryptophanase requires a separate preparation and test.<br>
Example XXV<br>
In this medium, a fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside and chromogenic 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside are used. E. coli and general coliforms both react with α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside and β-D-galactopyranoside so that the total coliforms will<br>
appear as teal under ambient light and fluoresce under ultraviolet light. E. coli<br>
will be the same color as general coliforms in this particular medium.<br>
Aeromonas which reacts with β-D-galactopyranoside will appear as teal under<br>
ambient light and will not fluoresce, and Salmonella, which will not be<br>
colored in ambient light, will fluoresce under an ultraviolet light.<br>
Example XXVI<br>
This example uses a chromogenic 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoly-α-D-<br>
galactopyranoside and fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferyl- β-D-<br>
galactopyranoside. As with Example XXV, E. coli and general coliforms will<br>
appear the same so that the total coliforms will be teal under ambient light and<br>
will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Aeromonas will have no color under<br>
ambient light, but will fluoresce under an ultraviolet light, and Salmonella will<br>
show as teal in ambient light and will not fluoresce under ultraviolet light. It<br>
should be evident that other chromogenic and nonchromogenic or fluorogenic<br>
substrate components may be substituted for those specified in Examples<br>
XXV and XXVI.<br>
Although several broad examples which incorporate the present<br>
invention have been described above, it is to be understood that the present<br>
invention is not to be limited by the examples disclosed herein. Indeed, the<br><br>
WO 2006/107583	PCT/US2006/010177<br>
55<br>
disclosure and examples above teach one of ordinary skill a virtually limitless<br>
number of test media which would be within the scope of the claims appended<br>
hereto.<br>
Further, while this invention has been described as having a preferred<br>
design, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and<br>
scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any<br>
variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles.<br>
Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present<br>
disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this<br>
invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.<br><br>
