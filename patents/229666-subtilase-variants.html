SUBTILASE VARIANTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel subtilase variants exhibiting alterations relative to the parent subtilase in one or more properties including: Wash performance, thermal stability, storage stability or catalytic activity. The variants of the invention are suitable for use in e.g. cleaning or detergent compositions, such as laundry detergent compositions and dish wash compositions, including automatic dish wash compositions. The present invention also relates to isolated DNA sequences encoding the variants, expression vectors, host cells, and methods for producing and using the variants of the invention. Further, the present invention relates to cleaning and detergent compositions comprising the variants of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 3 0 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM* (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE* (Novo Nordisk A/S) , MAXAPEM*     (Gist-Brocades    N.V.),     PURAFECT®    (Genencor International, Inc.).<br>
Further, a number of protease variants are described in the art. A thorough list of prior art protease variants is given in WO 99/27082.<br>
However, even though a number of useful protease variants have been described, there is still a need for new improved proteases or protease variants for a number of industrial uses such as laundry or hard surface cleaning.<br><br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide improved subtilase variants for such purposes.<br>

NOMENCLATURE AND CONVENTIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF VARIANTS In describing the various subtilase enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to the invention, the following nomenclatures  and  conventions  have  been  adapted  for  ease  of reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent enzyme with subtilisin BPN' (BASBPN).<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 to number the variants using the following parameters: gap creation penalty = 8 and gap extension penalty =<br><br>
8 and all other parameters kept at their default values.<br>
Another method is to use known recognized alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Thereby a number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation to BASBPN (SEQ ID NO.3). In Fig. 1, subtilisin 309 (SEQ ID N0.4)has 6 deletions in positions 36, 58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN. These deletions are in Fig. 1 indicated by asterixes (*) .<br>
- The various modifications performed in a parent enzyme is indicated in general using three elements as follows:<br>
Original amino acid position substituted amino acid<br>
The notation G195E thus means a substitution of a glycine in position 195 with a glutamic acid,<br>
In the case where the original amino acid residue may be any amino acid residue, a short hand notation may at times be used indicating only the position and substituted amino acid:<br>
Position substituted amino acid<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous subtilases {vide infra).<br>
Similarly when the identity of the substituting amino acid residue(s) is immaterial;<br>
Original amino acid position<br>
When both the original amino acid(s) and substituted amino acid(s) may comprise any amino acid, then only the position is indicated, e.g.: 170.<br><br>
When the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), then the selected amino acids are indicated inside brackets:<br>
Original amino acid position {substituted amino acidi, . . . , substituted amino acid-n)<br>
For specific variants the specific three or one letter codes are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate any amino acid residue.<br>
SUBSTITUTIONS: - The substitution of glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Glu   or   G195E<br>
or the substitution of any amino acid residue acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Xaa   or  G195X or<br>
Glyl95      or  G195<br>
The substitution of serine for any amino acid residue in position 170 would thus be designated<br>
Xaal70Ser  or  X170S. or<br>
170Ser     or   170S<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous subtilases (vide infra). 170Ser is thus meant to comprise e.g. both a Lysl70Ser modification in BASBPN and Argl70Ser modification in BLSAVI (cf. Fig. 1) .<br>
For a modification where the original amino acid(s)  and/or<br><br>
substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s), the substitution of glycine, alanine, serine or threonine for arginine in position 170 would be indicated by<br><br>
to indicate the variants<br><br>
DELETIONS:<br>
A deletion of glycine in position 195 will be indicated by:<br><br>
Correspondingly the deletion of more than one amino acid residue, such as the deletion of glycine and leucine in positions 195 and 196 will be designated<br><br>
INSERTIONS:<br>
The insertion of an additional amino acid residue such as e.g.   a<br>
lysine after G195 is indicated by:<br><br>
or, when more than one amino acid residue is inserted, such as e.g. a Lys and Ala after G195 this will be indicated as:<br><br>
In such cases the inserted amino acid residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue(s). In the above example the sequences 194 to 196 would thus be:<br><br>
194	195	196<br>
BLSAVI      A -	G -	L<br>
194	195	195a 195b 196<br>
Variant    A -	G -	K -  A -  L    (SEQ ID NO.l)<br>
In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted it is clear that degeneracy in the nomenclature arises. If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G195GG. The same actual change could just as well be indicated as A194AG for the change from<br><br>
Such instances will be apparent to the skilled person, and the indication G195GG and corresponding indications for this type of insertions are thus meant to comprise such equivalent degenerate indications.<br>
FILLING A GAP:<br>
Where a deletion in an enzyme exists in the reference comparison with the subtil is in BPN' sequence used for the numbering, an insertion in such a position is indicated as:<br><br>
for the insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36<br>
MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS:<br>
Variants comprising multiple modifications are  separated by<br><br>
pluses, e.g. :<br>
Argl70Tyr+Glyl95Glu   or   R17 0Y+G195E<br>
representing modifications in positions 170 and 195 substituting tyrosine and glutamic acid for arginine and glycine, respectively.<br>
Thus, Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr} designates the following variants:<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Gly+Argl7 0Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ser,	Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Thr,<br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Gly,	Tyrl67Thr+Argl7 0Ala,<br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ser,   and Tyrl67Thr+Argl7 0Thr.<br>
This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to modifications aimed at substituting, replacing, inserting or deleting amino acid residues having specific common properties, such as residues of positive charge (K, R, H) , negative charge (D, E), or conservative amino acid modification(s) of e.g. Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}, which signifies substituting a small amino acid for another small amino acid. See section "Detailed description of the invention" for further details.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3).<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br><br>
If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to  that  of  the  subtilase  BPN'  (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN' sequence, see Fig. 1 or Siezen et al.,   Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handl er and Smith, 1973 "Principles of   Biochemistry, " Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272).<br>
- The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by diisopro-pylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological     Rev.   41 711-753).<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et al. , Protein Engng. 4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al. now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et al.(1997).<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases,  I-SI or utrue" subtilisins,<br><br>
comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168),  subtilisin  BPN',  subtilisin  Carlsberg  (ALCAIASE*, NOVOZYMES A/S), and subtilisin DY (BSSDY).<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognized by Siezen et al. (supra) . Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL , Gist-Brocades NV) , subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE®, NOVOZYMES A/S) , subtilisin 147 (BLS147) (ESPERASE*, NOVOZYMES A/S) , and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB).<br>
* "SAVINASE®"<br>
SAVINASE® is marketed by NOVOZYMES A/S. It is subtilisin 309 from B. Lentus    and differs from BAALKP only in one position<br>
(N87S,  see  Fig.  1  herein) .  SAVINASE® has  the  amino  acid sequence designated b) in Fig. 1.<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term "parent subtilase" describes a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al. (1991 and 1997) . For further details see description of "SUBTILASES" immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modifications have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Furthermore, a parent subtilase may also be a subtilase which has been prepared by the DNA shuffling technique, such as described by J.E. Ness et al.t Nature Biotechnology, 17, 893-896 (1999). Alternatively the term "parent subtilase" may be termed "wild type subtilase".<br>
For reference a table of the acronyms for various subtilases mentioned herein is provided, for further acronyms, see Siezen et al., Protein Engng. 4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science  6 (1997) 501-523.<br><br>

Modification(s) of a subtilase variant<br>
I	"     '	"   '	—I—	'	III!<br>
The term "modification(s)" used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding a subtilase. The modification (s) can be replacement (s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s), deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
The homology between two amino acid sequences is in this context<br>
described by the parameter "identity".<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subti-<br><br>
lases the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 can be ap-' plied (infra) using the same settings. The output from the routine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between the two sequences.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous subtilases, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Isolated polynucleotide<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a polynucleotide, denotes that the polynucleotide has been removed from its natural genetic - milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones. Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5' and 3' untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators. The identification of associated regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985) . The term "an isolated polynucleotide" may alternatively be termed na cloned polynucleotide".<br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that<br>
the protein has been removed from its native environment.<br>
In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)).<br>
An isolated protein is more than 10% pure, preferably more than 2 0% pure, more preferably more than 3 0% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Further it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., more than 40% pure, more than 60%<br><br>
pure, more than 80% pure, more preferably more than 95% pure, and most preferably more than 9 9% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The term "homologous impurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the subtilase of the invention), which originate from the homologous cell where the subtilase of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
Obtained from<br>
The term "obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or subtilase produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br>
Substrate<br>
The term "substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide (amide) bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Product<br>
.,	I	|        I   ■■■	Mil        I   ■ll.l —<br>
The term "product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should, in the context of the present invention, be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>
Wash Performance<br>
In the present context the term "wash performance" is used as an enzyme's ability to remove proteinaceous or organic stains present on the object to be cleaned during e.g. wash or hard surface cleaning. See also the "Model Detergent Wash Performance<br><br>
Test" in Example 3 herein.<br>
Performance Factor<br>
The term "Performance Factor" is defined with respect to the<br>
below formula <br>
wherein P is the Performance Factor, Rvariant is the reflectance (measured at 460 nm) of the test material after being treated with a subtilase variant as described in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test", and Rparent is the reflectance (measured at 460 nm) of the test material after being treated with the ^ corresponding parent subtilase as described in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test". For further details, see the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" in Example 3 herein.<br>

A subtilase variant of the first aspect of the invention may be a parent or wild-type subtilase identified and isolated from nature.<br>
Such a parent wildtype subtilase may be specifically screened for by standard techniques known in the art.<br><br>
One preferred way of doing this may be by specifically PCR amplify conserved DNA regions of interest from subtilases from numerous different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains.<br>
Subtilases are a group of conserved enzymes, in the sense that their DNA and amino acid sequences are homologous. Accordingly it is possible to construct relatively specific primers flanking the polynucleotide sequences of interest.<br>
Using such PCR primers to amplify DNA from a number of different microorganisms, preferably different Bacillus strains, followed , by DNA sequencing of said amplified PCR fragments, it will be possible to identify strains which produce subtilase variants of the invention. Having identified the strain and a partial DNA sequence of such a subtilase of interest, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to complete cloning, expression and purification of such a subtilase.<br>
However, it is envisaged that a subtilase variant of the invention is predominantly a variant of a parent subtilase.<br>
A subtilase variant suitable for the uses described herein, may be constructed by standard techniques known in the art such as by site-directed/random mutagenesis or by DNA shuffling of different subtilase sequences. See the "Material and Methods" section herein (vide infra)   for further details.<br>
As will be acknowledged by the skilled person, the variants described herein may comprise one or more further modifications, in particular one or more further substitutions.<br>
Moreover, the variants described herein may encompass mutation at more than just one position. For example the variant according to the invention may contain mutations at one position, two positions, or more than two positions, such as three, four or five positions.<br><br>
It is well known in the art that a so-called conservative substitution of one amino acid residue to a similar amino acid residue is expected to produce only a minor change in the characteristic of the enzyme.<br>
Table II below list groups of conservative amino acid substitutions.<br>

Y	= tyrosine<br>
Small                         G	= glycine<br>
A = alanine S = serine T = threonine<br>
According to this principle subtilase variants comprising conservative substitutions are expected to exhibit characteristics that are not drastically different from each other.<br>
Based on the disclosed and/or exemplified subtilase variants herein, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable conservative modification(s) to these variants<br><br>
in order to obtain other subtilase variants exhibiting similarly improved wash-performance.<br>
It is preferred that the parent subtilase belongs to the subgroups I-SI and I-S2, especially subgroup I-S2, both for enzymes from nature or from the artificial creation of diversity, and for designing and producing variants from a parent subtilase.<br>
In relation to variants from subgroup I-SI, it is preferred to select a parent subtilase from the group consisting of BSS168 (BSSAS, BSAPRJ, BSAPRN, BMSAMP), BASBPN, BSSDY, BLSCAR (BLKERA, BLSCA1, BLSCA2, BLSCA3), BSSPRC, and BSSPRD, or functional variants thereof having retained the characteristic of sub-group I-Sl.<br>
In relation to variants from subgroup I-S2 it is preferred to select a parent subtilase from the group consisting of BSAPRQ, BLS147 (BSAPRM, BAH101), BLSAVI (BSKSMK, BAALKP, BLSUBL), BYSYAB, BAPB92, TVTHER, and BSAPRS, or functional variants thereof having retained the characteristic of sub-group I-S2.<br>
In particular, the parent subtilase is BLSAVI (Savinase®, NOVOZYMES A/S), and a preferred subtilase variant of the invention is accordingly a variant of Savinase®.<br>
The present invention also encompasses any of the above mentioned subtilase variants in combination with any other modification to the amino acid sequence thereof. Especially combinations with other modifications known in the art to provide improved properties to the enzyme are envisaged. The art describes a number of subtilase variants with different improved properties and a number of those are mentioned in the "Background of the invention" section herein {vide supra). Those references are disclosed here as references to identify a subtilase variant, which advantageously can be combined with a subtilase variant described herein.<br><br>
Such combinations comprise the positions: 222 (improves oxidation stability), 218 (improves thermal stability), substitutions in the Ca2+-binding sites stabilizing the enzyme, e.g. position 76, and many other apparent from the prior art.<br>
In further embodiments a subtilase variant described herein may advantageously be combined with one or more modification (s) in any of the positions:<br>
27, 36, 56, 76, 87, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 12 0, 123, 159, 167, 170, 206, 218, 222, 224, 23 2, 23 5, 236, 245,<br>
248, 252 and 274.<br>
&gt;<br>
Specifically, the following BLSAVI, BLSUBL, BSKSMK, and BAALKP modifications are considered appropriate for combination:<br>

and T274A.<br>
Furthermore variants comprising any of the modifications S101G+V1G4N, S87N+S101G+V104N, K27R+V104Y+N123S+T274A, N76D+S103A+V104I or N76D+V104A, or other combinations of the modifications K27R, N76D, S101G, S103A, V104N, V104Y, V104I, V104A, N123S, G159D, A232V, Q236H, Q245R, N248D, N252K, T274A in combination with any one or more of the modification(s) mentioned above exhibit improved properties.<br>
A particular interesting variant is a variant, which, in addition to modifications according to the invention, contains the following substitutions: S101G+S103A+V104I+G159D+A232V+Q236H+Q245R+N24 8D+N252K.<br>
Moreover, subtilase variants of the main aspect(s) of the invention are preferably combined with one or more modification(s) in any of the positions 129, 131 and 194, preferably as 129K, 131H<br><br>
and 194P modifications, and most preferably as P129K, P131H and A194P modifications. Any of those modification(s) are expected to provide a higher expression level of the subtilase variant in the production thereof.<br>
Furthermore the following specific variants of the invention are considered interesting:<br>

The wash performance of a selected variant of the invention may be tested in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" disclosed in Example 3 herein. The "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" may be employed to assess the ability of a variant, when incorporated in a standard detergent composition, to remove proteinaceous stains from a standard textile as compared to a reference system, namely the parent subtilase (incorporated in the same model detergent system and tested under identical conditions). Using this test, the wash performance of a selected variant can be initially investigated, the rationale being that if a selected variant does not show a significant improvement in the test compared to the parent subtilase, it is normally not necessary to carry out further test experiments.<br><br>
Therefore, variants which are particular interesting for the purposes described herein, are such variants which, when tested in a model detergent composition comprising<br>
6.2%	LAS (Nansa 80S)<br>
2%	Sodium salt   of  Ci6-Ci8  fatty  acid<br>
4%	Non-ionic  surfactant   (Plurafax LF404)<br>
22%	Zeolite   P<br>
10.5%	Na2C03<br>
4%	Na2Si205<br>
2%	Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)<br>
6.8%	Acrylate liquid CP5 40%<br>
20%	Sodium perborate (empirical formula NaB02.H202)<br>
0.2%	EDTA<br>
21%	Na2S04<br>
Water (balance)<br>
as described in the "Model Detergent Wash Performance Test" herein, shows an improved wash performance as compared to the parent subtilase tested under identical conditions.<br>
The improvement in the wash performance may be quantified by employing the so-called "Performance Factor" defined in Example 3, herein.<br>
In a very interesting embodiment of the invention, the variant of the invention, when tested in the "Wash Performance Test" has a Performance Factor of at least 1, such as at least 1.5, e.g. at least 2, preferably at least 2,5, such as at least 3, e.g. at least 3.5, in particular at least 4, such as at least 4.5, e.g. at least 5.<br>
Evidently, it is preferred that the variant of the invention fulfils the above criteria on at least the stated lowest level, more preferably at the stated intermediate level and most preferably on the stated highest level.<br><br>
PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase and for introducing substitutions, deletions or insertions into genes (e.g. subtilase genes) are well known in the art.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and introducing mutations (random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention. For further description of suitable techniques reference is made to Examples herein (vide infra) and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Har-, bor lab. , Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990), and WO 96/34946.<br>
Further, a subtilase variant may be constructed by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity, such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes (WO 95/22625; Stemmer WPC, Nature 370:389-91 (1994)). DNA shuffling of e.g. the gene<br>
encoding Savinase® with one or more partial subtilase sequences identified in nature, will after subsequent screening for improved wash performance variants, provide subtilase variants suitable for the purposes described herein.<br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA construct<br>
encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector that may<br>
conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures.<br>
The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into<br>
which it is to be introduced. Thus,  the vector may be an<br>
autonpmously replicating vector, i.e. a vector that exists as an<br>
extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent<br>
of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid.<br><br>
Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. - transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus stea.ro thermophilics maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease gene, or the Bacillus pumilus xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda PR or PL promoters or the E. coli lac, trp or tac promoters.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin,<br><br>
chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.) .<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. I f homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br><br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell that is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus, such as strains of B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. lentus, B. brevis, B. stearo thermophilics, B. alkalophilus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. coagulans, B. circulans, B. lautus, B. megraterium or B. thuringiensis, or strains of Streptomyces, such as S. lividans or S. murinus, or gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli -<br>
The transformation of the bacteria	may be effected by protoplast<br>
transformation,  electroporation,	conjugation,  or  by  using<br>
competent cells in a manner known	per se (cf. Sambrook et al. ,<br>
supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies) , or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br><br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated<br>
enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell,<br>
which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the<br>
enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the production<br>
of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the<br>
culture.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the enzyme of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) , which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>

•  PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU) . The activity is<br>
determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASE ), and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein (DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50°C, pH 8.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novozymes A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity that, under standard conditions, during a 15 minutes'<br>
incubation at 4 0°C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NH2-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glycine.<br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitro-phenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith, L.A., (1988).<br>

In order to purify a subtilase variant of the invention, a B. subtilis pJS3 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the invention is transformed into a competent B. subtilis strain and fermented as described above.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 liter scale fermentation for the production of the subtilases of the invention in a Bacillus  host cell.<br>
Approximately 1.6 liter of fermentation broth is centrifuged at 5 0 00 rpm for 3 5 minutes in 1 liter beakers. The pH of the supernatants is adjusted to 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra S100 filter plates.<br>
The filtrates are concentrated to approximately 4 00 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon S1Y10 UF cartridge. The UF concentrate is centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin affinity column at pH 7. The protease is eluted from the Bacitracin column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step are combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex<br><br>
G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column are combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protease is eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147).<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column are combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
The following variants according to the invention were produced and purified according to the above procedure.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
The "MODEL DETERGENT WASH PERFORMANCE TEST":<br>
In order to asses the wash performance of selected subtilase variants in a standard detergent composition, standard washing experiments  may be  performed using  the below experimental<br>
conditions:<br>
Detergent:	Model detergent<br>
Detergent dosage	4.0 g/1<br>
■ pH	10.1<br>
Wash time	2 0 min<br>
Temperature:	3 0°C<br>
Water hardness:        15°dH<br>
Enzyme concentration:   10 nm (in the detergent solution)<br>
Test system:	10 ml beakers with a stirring rod<br>
Textile/volume:        5 textile pieces (0 2 .5 cm)/50 ml<br>
detergent solution<br>
Test material:	A  suitable  textile  swatch,  such  as<br>
WFK10N (egg stains)<br>
The composition of the model detergent is as follows:<br>
6.2%	LAS (Nansa 80S)<br>
2%	Sodium salt  of  Ci6-C18  fatty acid<br>
4%	Non-ionic  surfactant   (Plurafax LF404)<br>
22%	Zeolite  P<br>
10.5%	Na2C03<br>
4%	Na2Si205<br>
2%	Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)<br>
6.8%	Acrylate liquid CP5 40%<br>
20%	Sodium perborate (empirical formula NaB02.H202)<br>
0.2%	EDTA<br>
21%	Na2S04<br><br>
Water (balance)<br>
pH of the detergent solution is adjusted to 10.1 by addition of HC1 or NaOH. Water hardness is adjusted to 15°dH by addition of CaCl2 and MGC12 (Ca2+;Mg2+ = 4:1) to the test system. After washing the textile pieces are flushed in tap water and air-dried.<br>
Measurement of the reflectance (Rvariant) on the test material is<br>
performed at 46 0 nm using a Macbeth ColorEye 7000 photometer<br>
(Macbeth,  Division  of  Kollmorgen  Instruments  Corporation,<br>
Germany). The measurements are performed in accordance with the<br>
- manufacturer's protocol.<br>
In order to determine a blank value,	a similar wash experiment<br>
is  performed  without  addition  of	enzyme.  The  subsequent<br>
measurement of the reflectance (Rbiank)	is performed as described<br>
right above.<br>
A reference experiment is then performed as described above, wherein the wash performance of the parent enzyme is tested. The subsequent measurement of the reflectance (Rparent) is performed as described right above.<br>
The wash performance is evaluated by means of the Performance Factor (P) which is defined in accordance with the below formula:<br><br><br><br><br>
