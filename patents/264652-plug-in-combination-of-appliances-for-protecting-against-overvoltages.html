				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a plug-in combination of appliances for protection against overvoltages, comprising a socket-type lower part and one or several plug-in modules which accommodate the overvoltage protection elements, contact elements and contact counter elements which are respectively arranged in the lower part and in the plug-in module, as well as complementary guide rails or guide grooves for the controlled insertion or sliding-on and fixing of the respective plug-in module in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many cases, overvoltage protection devices according to the state of the art are constructed as plug-in combination of appliances, comprising a lower part and a plug-in module.<br>
Connecting terminals for contact-making of the electric conductors are disposed in the lower part, and corresponding receptacles for the plug-in modules to be inserted are provided therein. The lower part also houses elements which encompass one or several male contacts of the plug-in module, so that the desired mechanical and electrical contact as well as the appropriate seat of the plug-in module in the lower part is ensured.<br>
The overvoltage protection elements proper, such as e. g. spark gaps, varistors, gas dischargers, or the like are located within the plug-in module.<br>
The lower parts are often formed as U-shaped bodies, with the open legs of the U-shaped body laterally encompassing the plug-in module so that the plug-in module rests upon the connecting leg of the U-shaped parts. The lower part is further provided with receptacle elements at its installation side, which enable a so-called top-hat rail assembly.<br>
The advantage of the briefly described separated functions between lower part and plug-in module  is that the  plug-in  module may be  removed  for inspection  and<br><br>
maintenance work without the necessity to open the connecting terminal or to disconnect the respective system from the supply, respectively.<br>
The removed and separated plug-in module may then be examined remote from the electric system by means of special testing devices, and replaced or reassembled, as the case may be.<br>
With respect to the state of the art, reference is made e. g. to DE 36 39 533 C2, DE 295 19 313 Ul, DE 100 01 667 CI, and DE 20 2004 006 227 Ul.<br>
As a special problem attention should be paid to the fact that in the course of designing the male contact arrangement between lower part and plug-in module, this contact is to be designed for the surge current flowing through said contact in the discharge case with wave forms 10/350 \is and 8/20 \is or the mains frequency short circuit current, respectively.<br>
In particular in overvoltage lightning current arresters as they are demanded in the market, partly considerable surge currents of up to 100 kA have to be carried several times via these contacts in such a manner that nearly no contact erosion or wear occurs. The relevant tests are specified in the product standards for overvoltage protection devices.<br>
In order to reliably control surge currents of such magnitude, a very high contact force between the individual contact elements has to be selected. The consequence is that the plug-in modules according to the state of the art can be removed with considerable force applied and in most cases with the aid of a special tool only. Thus, an additional tool is required which means a considerable drawback for the use of the devices. There is also an additional potential hazard in that when handling the tool, an arcing fault may be caused unintentionally within the arrester with the resulting danger for humans and systems.<br>
In cases where the contact force between the contact elements is designed lower, the removal of the plug-in modules may be facilitated, but there is a risk that under the<br><br>
influence of the effects of electrodynamic forces during the surge current, the plug-in module may unintentionally come free from the lower part so that a proper overall function of the device without providing for additional protective means is no longer ensured.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an advanced plug-in combination of appliances for protection against overvoltages, comprising a socket-type lower part and one or several plug-in modules, with the combination of appliances being capable of carrying considerable surge currents in a manner with is free from erosion and wear, on the one hand, while the plug-in module which is located in the socket-type lower part enabling its disconnection and removal without any problems, i. e. without auxiliary means or special tools, on the other hand.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for a plug-in combination of appliances for protection against overvoltages, comprising a socket-type lower part and one or several plug-in modules which accommodate the overvoltage protection elements, contact elements and contact counter elements which are respectively arranged in the lower part and in the plug-in module, as well as complementary guide rails or guide grooves for the controlled insertion or sliding-on and fixing of the respective plug-in module, characterised in that functionally separated mechanical catch or snap-in elements are provided which act between the respective plug-in module und the socket-type lower part, regardless of the forces which keep the contact elements and counter contact elements positively and/or non-positively connected with the plug-in module inserted, with the catch or snap-in function may be cancelled without any mechanical auxiliary means when a replacement of the respective plug-in module is desired.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the primary embodiment of the present invention is a plug-in combination of appliances for protection against overvoltages, comprising a socket-type lower part and one or several plug-in modules which accommodate the overvoltage protection elements, contact elements and contact counter elements which are respectively arranged in the lower part and in the plug-in module, as well as complementary guide rails or guide grooves for the controlled insertion or sliding-on and fixing of the respective plug-in module, wherein functionally separated mechanical catch or snap-in elements are provided which act between the respective plug-in module und the socket-type lower part, regardless of the forces which keep the contact elements and counter contact elements positively and/or non-positively connected with the plug-in module inserted, with the catch or snap-in function may be cancelled without any mechanical auxiliary means when a replacement of the respective plug-in module is desired.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the plug-in module comprises a carrier unit with a bottom group, with several large-area contact elements being arranged on the bottom group, the bottom group further comprising a trough-type lower side from which stop edges, stop faces, and/or stop pins extend downwards in the direction of the socket-type lower part, the carrier unit is enclosed by a hood, the hood having a hinge face at two opposite sides, which continues into a pressure plate at the end of which catch projections or catch cams are provided which in the inserted condition fulfill the catch or snap-in function with respect to the lower part, and further a spring-type mechanical energy store is provided between the lower part and the plug-<br><br>
in module, which upon insertion of the respective plug-in module is biased and upon cancelling the catch or snap-in function releases mechanical energy for removing the plug-in module from the socket-type lower part.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the carrier unit accommodates the overvoltage protection elements and a face or edge which limits the movement of the pressure plate is formed at the carrier unit below the pressure plate of the hood.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, catch projections are provided in the area of the bottom group of the carrier unit, which engage complementary recesses in the hood locking it.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the hood comprises two each opposite wide sides and narrow sides.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the pressure plate is provided at at least one of the narrow sides.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the recesses in the hood are arranged in the lower portion of the wide sides.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the outer surface of the pressure plate is patterned.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the catch projections or catch cams of the pressure plate have a wedge-shaped sliding surface, with the respective wedge tips being oriented in the direction of insertion.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention a coding pin and/or an element which triggers a telecommunication contact is provided at the bottom group.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the hood comprises a wedge shape in its lower portion, which extends over its width.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the hood is spherically or arc-shaped at its top.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the lower part has a U-shape, with catch or snap-in elements being arranged in the open legs of the lower part, and with recesses being provided in the connecting leg for the spring-type mechanical energy store(s) and their actuation.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the open legs comprise longitudinally extending guide rails to facilitate the insertion of the respective plug-in module.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the connecting leg comprises a shape which is complementary to the lower side of the bottom group, with receptacles being provided for one spring unit each below the connecting leg, which provide an upward access for the stop edges, stop pins, or stop faces of the bottom group.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the respective spring units bear against the bottom of the socket-type lower part.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention at least one recess for a coding pin or an access to a telecommunication contact is provided in the connecting leg.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the catch or snap-in elements as well as the mechanical energy stores are multiple-provided and are preferably arranged symmetrically.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the connecting leg comprises one integrally formed web each at both sides, which stabilises the opposite open leg portions.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the plug-in module with the upper hood part and the pressure plates disposed thereon remains freely accessible in the inserted condition.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the contact elements and the counter contact elements are designed as male contacts with a high contact holding force, which are capable of carrying surge currents.<br><br>
Thus, the basic idea of the invention is to separate the functions between the assemblies of the electric male contact system, a locking unit, and disengagement elements in such a manner that the plug-in module biases one or several mechanic energy stores, e. g. in the form of leaf or helical springs, upon the insertion into the socket-type lower part.<br>
The locking unit locks the plug-in module in the desired end position.<br>
If the plug-in module has to be removed, the locking at the locking unit is cancelled by simply applying a manual force. Due to the effect of the mechanical force, the plug-in module may then be moved out of the lower part, with negligible tensile forces applied.<br>
The design of the above mentioned functional groups may be varied and thus optimised over a wide range. It is therefore principally conceivable to design the disengagement forces in such a manner that the plug-in module is automatically urged out of the male contacts. The mechanical adjustment may likewise be made in such a manner that the plug-in modules can be pulled out with considerable force only.<br>
An essential advantage of the invention is that the contact system proper, i. e. the structural design of the contact elements and counter contact elements can optimally be designed for the function as a surge current discharge.<br>
In the realisation of the inventive basic idea, a functionally separated arrangement of mechanical catch or snap-in elements is therefore provided which act between the respective plug-in module und the socket-type lower part, regardless of the forces which keep the contact elements and counter contact elements positively and/or non-positively connected with the plug-in module inserted.<br>
The catch or snap-in function may be cancelled without any mechanical auxiliary means when a replacement or inspection of the respective plug-in module is desired.<br>
Furthermore, a spring-type mechanical energy store is provided in an embodiment between the lower part and the plug-in module, which upon inserting the respective<br><br>
plug-in module is biased and upon cancelling the catch or snap-in function releases mechanical energy for disengaging the plug-in module from the socket-type lower part.<br>
The plug-in module comprises a carrier unit with a bottom group, with several large-area contact elements being arranged at the bottom group.<br>
The bottom group further includes a trough-type lower side from which stop edges, stop faces, and/or stop pins extend downwards in the direction of the socket-type lower part.<br>
The carrier unit is enclosed in a hood, with the hood comprising a hinge face at opposite sides, which continues into a pressure plate at whose ends catch projections or catch cams are provided which in the inserted condition fulfil the catch or snap-in function with respect to the lower part.<br>
The hood may be formed as a plastic mould part, wherein the hinge face may be a so-called foil hinge joint. The hinge face with the pressure plate is normally biased in such a manner that the catch projections or catch cams assume a maximally outer position. By subjecting the pressure plate to a small force, the catch projections or catch cams may be moved towards each other, i. e. in the direction of the hood inner side, and exit and clear complementary recesses which are located in the socket-type lower part.<br>
The above mentioned carrier unit accommodates the overvoltage protection elements proper. A face or edge which limits the movement of the pressure plate is arranged below the pressure plate of the hood.<br>
In the area of the bottom assembly of the carrier unit catch projections are provided which engage the complementary recesses in the hood, locking it.<br>
The hood comprises two opposite wide sides and two opposite narrow sides, with the pressure plates being located at the narrow sides.<br>
The recesses in the hood are preferably arranged in the lower portion of the wide sides.<br>
For an easier actuation of the pressure plates and for pulling out the plug-in module from the lower part, the outer surface of the pressure plate is patterned.<br><br>
The catch projections or catch cams of the pressure plate may comprise a wedge-shaped sliding surface with the respective wedge tips being oriented in the direction of insertion. During the insertion process, the wedge-shaped sliding surfaces slide along the surface of the socket-type lower part and then engage the recesses provided therein, with the pressure plate being relieved.<br>
At the bottom group, coding pins and/or an element which triggers a telecommunication contact may be provided.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the hood has a wedge shape in its lower portion, which extends over the hood's width. In this embodiment, the hood is further spherically or arc-shaped at its upper portion.<br>
The lower part of the combination of appliances has a U-shape, with catch or snap-in elements being arranged in the open legs of the lower part, and with recesses being provided in the connecting leg for the spring-type mechanical energy store(s) and their actuation.<br>
The open legs may further comprise longitudinally extending guide rails for facilitating the insertion of the plug-in module. These guide rails may also have a coding function in order to enable a defined insertion, so that a wrong installation of the respective lower parts can be prevented.<br>
The connecting leg of the lower part comprises a shape which is complementary to the lower side of the bottom group, with receptacles being provided for one spring unit each below the connecting leg, which provide an upward access for the stop edges, stop pins, or stop faces of the bottom group.<br>
Preferably, the respective spring units bear against the bottom of the socket-type lower part. The springs of the spring unit are replaceable so that with a standardised structural concept of the lower part an adjustment to the respective application with respect to bias und disengagement forces can be easily effected.<br><br>
At least one recess for a coding pin or an access to a telecommunication contact is provided in the connecting leg.<br>
The catch or snap-in elements as well as the mechanical energy stores are multiple-provided and are preferably arranged symmetrically.<br>
The connecting leg of the lower part comprises one integrally formed web each at both sides, which stabilises the opposite open leg portions, so that there is not risk that these portions are driven apart upon the insertion of the plug-in module.<br>
The respective plug-in module with the hood upper part and the pressure plates located thereon protrudes in the inserted condition and thus remains accessible for the actuation of the pressure plates for the purpose of removing the plug-in module.<br>
The contact elements and the counter contact elements which are located in the plug-in module, on the one hand, and in the lower part, on the other hand, are made as male contacts which are capable of carrying surge currents and which have a high contact holding force, with the contact holding force, however, being not required to primarily or simultaneously provide a mechanical locking of the plug-in module in the lower part.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the plug-in module 1 consists of a carrier unit 4 and a hood<br>
5.<br>
Below the hood 5 or on the carrier unit 4, respectively, the active components proper of the overvoltage discharge device are arranged and in electric contact with the male contacts 2.<br>
The male contacts 2 are made as large-area metallic blocks which are preferably arranged symmetrically at the opposite sides.<br>
On both end faces of the hood 5, actuating faces 6' made as pressure plates 6 are arranged.<br>
These can be integrated into the construction of the hood element at reasonable costs because they are movably arranged at the top via a mechanically configured hinge face<br>
7.<br><br>
When subjecting the actuating faces 6' to a mechanical force, they are moved inwardly, with a stop plate 8 of the carrier unit 4 serving as a displacement limiter.<br>
The available displacement of the pressure plate 6 is so adjusted that the catch projections 9 arranged in the lower part exit their mating pieces 9' (see Fig. 2) so that the locking engagement is cancelled.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, a total of two catch projections 9 each are arranged at the end faces so that the plug-in module 1 comprises a total of four fixed points and is thereby correctly balanced and maintained free of distortion in the desired position.<br>
The surface of the actuating face 6' is provided with a pattern so that the removal of the plug-in module 1 is easy without requiring an excessive effort.<br>
The lower side of the carrier unit 4 which is formed as a trough-type bottom group may additionally comprise a coding pin or a telecommunication actuating contact 100.<br>
Stop edges, stop faces, or stop pins 10 extend from the lower side of the above mentioned bottom group, which act as pressure points with respect to said associated spring unit 11 (Fig. 2).<br>
The carrier unit 4 comprises catch projections 110 in the area of the bottom group, which engage complementary recesses 111 in the hood 5 locking it.<br>
The catch projections 9 of the pressure plate 6 have a wedge-shaped sliding surface 112, with the wedge tips being oriented in the direction of insertion.<br>
As can be seen from the illustration, the hood 5 is designed wedge-shaped in its lower portion, with the top of the hood 5 having a spherical or arc-shaped configuration.<br>
Each plug-in module 1 is preferably provided with two or four symmetrically arranged male contact elements 2. By forming the male contact elements 2 as a movable or stationary part, respectively, it is possible to carry relatively high surge currents in a nearly wear-free manner via the large-area contact elements. The uniformly distributed arrangement   of  individual   male   contacts   at  the   lower  side  ensures  a  uniform<br><br>
homogeneous force distribution so that even with high electrodynamic forces, no deformation or tilt of the plug-in module within the lower part will occur.<br>
According to the illustration in figures 2 and 3, the lower part of the combination of appliances has a U-shape. The lower part 12 comprises two open U-shaped legs 120 and a connecting leg 121.<br>
The above mentioned recesses 9' for the catch projections 9 of the plug-in module 1 are formed in the open legs 120 of the lower part 12.<br>
The connecting leg 121 comprises recesses 122 for the spring-type mechanical energy store(s) and their actuation.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the open legs 120 are provided with guide rails 13 for an easier and correct insertion of the respective plug-in module 1.<br>
The connecting leg 121 further comprises at its top a shape which is complementary to the lower side of the bottom group of the plug-in module 1, with receptacles 123 being provided for one spring unit 11 each below the connecting leg, which comprise an upward access for the stop edges 10 of the bottom group of the plug-in module 1.<br>
As can be seen from figures 2 and 3, the respective spring units 1 each of which comprises at least one helical spring, bear against the bottom of the socket-type lower part.<br>
In the connecting leg 121 there is also provided at least one recess 124 for a coding pin or as an access to a telecommunication contact.<br>
At both sides of the connecting leg 121 an integrally formed web 125 is provided for reinforcing and stabilising the entire arrangement of the lower part.<br>
In the inserted condition (see Fig. 3) the plug-in module 1 with the hood upper part and the pressure plates disposed thereon remains accessible.<br>
During the insertion of the plug-in module 1 into the lower part 12, which is guided by the guide rails and making the desired electric contact between the respective male<br><br>
contact 2 and the counter pieces in the lower part, the mechanical force applied is utilised to bias the mechanical energy stores 3 and 11, respectively, which are disposed in the lower part 12.<br>
This is effected by the respective stop edges, stop pins, or stop faces with the pressure points provided thereon.<br>
In each lower part 12 there are preferably integrated e. g. four spring units 11. The<br>
number and the symmetrical positioning ensure an optimum homogeneity of the force<br>
application.<br>
The disengagement force to be set and the associated disengagement travel may be<br>
varied over a wide range via the actual structural design of the mechanical energy store<br>
3, in particular the selection of a suitable spring element and its spring characteristic.<br>
Upon disengaging the catch projections 9 from the recesses 9' by subjecting the pressure plate 6 or the actuating face 6', respectively, to a compressive force, the catch projections 9 are disengaged from the recesses 9'. As a result, the plug-in module 1 may be removed easily under utilisation of the stored mechanical energy in the spring units without further mechanical auxiliary means or tools.<br><br>
