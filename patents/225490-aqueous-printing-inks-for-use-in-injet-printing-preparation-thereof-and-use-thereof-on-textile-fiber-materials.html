Description<br>
Aqueous printing inks for use in inkjet printing, preparation thereof and use thereof<br>
on textile fiber materials<br>
Digital printing techniques will become increasingly important in the future in the<br>
textile area as well as in the nontextile area.<br>
Changed market expectations in conventional textile printing demand more flexibility<br>
in design, color and delivery time. Digital inkjet technology is the answer. By making<br>
it possible to print directly from the computer via printing nozzles without the need to<br>
prepare printing screens, the new technology improves printing process flexibility,<br>
efficiency and environmental performance. It provides substantially integrated<br>
operations, shortens printing times and meets the demand for rapid reaction to<br>
market developments and for fewer intermediate stages in the production process.<br>
The inkjet printing process is usually carried out using aqueous inks, which are<br>
sprayed as small droplets directly onto the substrate. There is a continuous form of<br>
the process, in which the ink is pressed piezoelectrically through a nozzle at a<br>
uniform rate and deflected onto the substrate by an electric field, depending on the<br>
pattern to be produced, and there is an uninterrupted inkjet or drop-on-demand<br>
process, in which the ink is expelled only where a colored dot is to appear. The latter<br>
form of the process employs either a piezoelectric crystal or a heated cannula<br>
(bubble or thermal jet process) to exert pressure on the ink system and so eject an<br>
ink droplet. These techniques are described in Text. Chem.Color, volume 19 (8),<br>
pages 23 ff and volume 21 pages 27 ff.<br>
This highly sensitive microtechnology requires the development of tailored dye<br>
preparations (inks) meeting, for example, high requirements with regard to purity,<br>
particle size, viscosity, surface tension, conductivity, physico-chemical stability,<br>
thermophysical properties, the pH, the absence of foam, color strength, fastness<br>
level and stability in storage. Commercially available reactive dyes in the form of<br>
their powder, granular or liquid formulations of the kind used for conventional, analog<br>
textile printing contain significant electrolyte quantities, dustproofing agents and<br>
standarizers which lead to massive problems in inkjet printing. On the other hand,<br>
dye inks as used for nontextile materials, for example paper, wood, plastics,<br>
ceramics, etc. provide only unsatisfactory results with regard to ease of application<br>
and print color yield and fastnesses on textile material.<br>
The European patent applications EP-A 0 886 000 and EP-A 0 885 998,<br>
EP 0 620 116, EP-A 0 606 777, DE-A 4417718, DE-A 4417719 describe dye inks<br>
containing fiber-reactive dyes. These dye inks have some application weaknesses,<br>
for example unsatisfactory dye ink stability or low dye yield owing to insufficient<br>
interaction of the dyes from the ink with the fiber. The European patent specification<br>
EP-A 0 602 885 describes sulfolane-containing dye inks for the nontextile area<br>
which are not suitable for textile application. Consequently, there is a demand for<br>
novel printing inks for the inkjet process with fiber-reactive dyes that have improved<br>
properties, especially application properties.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide printing inks that do not have the<br>
abovementioned disadvantages.<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, aqueous printing inks containing sulfolane,<br>
which does not impair the reactivity of reactive dyes and at the same time<br>
substantially prevents nozzle cloggage, one or more reactive dyes and a buffer<br>
system ensuring the functionality of the reactive groups provide excellent results.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides aqueous textile inkjet printing inks<br>
including one or more reactive dyes, sulfolane and a buffer system and having a pH<br>
of not more than 7.0 when one or more of said reactive dyes have reactive systems<br>
of the vinyl sulfone series.<br>
Useful dyes include all reactive dyes recited for example in European patent<br>
specifications EP-B 590397, EP-A 886000 and EP-A 613975.<br>

The printing inks of the invention may further include customary additives, for<br>
example viscosity moderators to set viscosities in the range from 1.5 to 40.0 mPa*s<br>
in a temperature range from 20 to 50°C. Preferred inks have a viscosity of 1.5 to<br>
20 mPa*s and particularly preferred inks have a viscosity of 1.5 to 15 mPa*s.<br>
Useful viscosity moderators include rheological additives, for example:<br>

associative thickeners, polyurea, polyurethane, sodium alginates, modified<br>
galactomannans, polyetherurea, polyurethane, nonionic cellulose ethers.<br>
As further additives the inks of the invention may include surface-active substances<br>
to set surface tensions of 20 to 65 mN/m, which are adapted if necessary as a<br>
function of the process used (thermal or piezotechnology).<br>
Useful surface-active substances include for example:<br>
nonionic surfactants, butyldiglycol, 1,2-hexanediol.<br>
The inks may further include customary additives, for example substances to inhibit<br>
fungal and bacterial growth in amounts of 0.01 to 1% by weight based on the total<br>
weight of the ink.<br>
The inks may be prepared in a conventional manner by mixing the components in<br>
water.<br>
The dye inks of the invention are useful in inkjet printing processes for printing a<br>
wide variety of pretreated materials, such as silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibers and<br>
polyurethanes, and especially cellulosic fiber materials of any kind. Such fiber<br>
materials are for example in the natural fiber cellulose fibers, such as cotton, linen<br>
and hemp, and also pulp and regenerated cellulose. The printing inks of the<br>
invention are also useful for printing pretreated hydroxyl- or amino-containing fibers<br>
present in blend fabrics, for example blends of cotton, silk, wool with polyester fibers<br>
or polyamide fibers.<br>
In contrast to conventional textile printing, where the printing ink already contains all<br>
the fixing chemicals and thickeners for a reactive dye, in inkjet printing the auxiliaries<br>
have to be applied to the textile substrate in a separate pretreatment step.<br>
The pretreatment of the textile substrate, for example cellulose and regenerated<br>
cellulose fibers and also silk and wool, is effected with an aqueous alkaline liquor<br>
prior to printing. To fix reactive dyes there is a need for alkali, for example sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium acetate, trisodium phosphate, sodium<br>
silicate, sodium hydroxide, alkali donors such as, for example, sodium<br>
trichloroacetate, sodium formate, hydrotropic substances such as, for example,<br>
urea, reduction inhibitors, for example sodium nitrobenzenesulfonates, and also<br>
thickeners to prevent flowing of the motives when the printing ink is applied, for<br>
example sodium alginates, modified polyacrylates or highly etherified<br>
galactomannans.<br>
These pretreatment reagents are uniformly applied to the textile substrate in a<br>
defined amount using suitable applicators, for example using a 2- or 3-roll pad,<br>
contactless spraying technologies, by means of foam application or using<br>
appropriately adapted inkjet technologies, and subsequently dried.<br>
After printing, the textile fiber material is dried at 120 to 150°C and subsequently<br>
fixed.<br>
The fixing of the inkjet prints prepared with reactive dyes may be effected at room<br>
temperature or with saturated steam, with superheated steam, with hot air, with<br>
microwaves, with infrared radiation, with laser or electron beams or with other<br>
suitable energy transfer techniques.<br>
A distinction is made between one- and two-phase fixing processes:<br>
In one-phase fixing, the necessary fixing chemicals are already on the textile<br>
substrate.<br>
In two-phase fixing, this pretreatment is unnecessary. Fixing only requires alkali,<br>
which, following inkjet printing, is applied prior to the fixing process, without<br>
intermediate drying. There is no need for further additives such as urea or thickener.<br>
Fixing is followed by the print after treatment, which is the prerequisite for good<br>
fastnesses, high brilliance and an impeccable white ground.<br>
The prints prepared with the dye inks of the invention, especially on cellulose fiber<br>
materials, have high color strength and a high fiber-dye bond stability not only in the<br>
acidic but also in the alkaline range, good lightfastness and very good wetfastness<br>
properties, such as wash, water, seawater, cross-dyeing and perspiration<br>
fastnesses, and also good fastness to heat setting and plating and crockfastness.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages are by<br>
weight, unless otherwise stated. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume as the<br>
kilogram relates to the liter.<br>
