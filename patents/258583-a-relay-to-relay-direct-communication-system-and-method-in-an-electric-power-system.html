				<td>A RELAY-TO-RELAY DIRECT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD IN<br>
AN ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No.<br>
09/900,098 entitled "RELAY-TO-RELAY DIRECT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN<br>
AN ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM", filed July. 6, 2001, and is related to U. S.<br>
Patent No 5,793,750 entitled "SYSTEM OF COMMUNICATING OUTPUT<br>
FUNCTION STATUS INDICATIONS BETWEEN TWO OR MORE POWER<br>
SYSTEM PROTECTIVE RELAYS", issued August 11, 1998.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001]	This invention relates generally to communication systems in an<br>
electric power system, and more specifically to a relay-to-relay direct<br>
communication system and method in an electric power system.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[002]	In U.S. Pat. No. 5,793,750, the contents of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference, a communication system between two<br>
microprocessor-based protective relays for an electric power system is<br>
1<br><br>
disclosed. Each of the two relays in that system has both transmit and receive<br>
modules, for directly transmitting indication status bits indicative of the result of<br>
selected protective functions of one relay from that one relay to the other, and<br>
vice versa.<br>
[003]	The output status indication bits are sometimes used to identify the<br>
existence and location of a fault on the power line portion served by the two<br>
relays. One or both of the relays might initiate a circuit breaker trip action on<br>
the basis of the exchange of such information. The output status indication bits<br>
may be the result of processing functions in one of the relays involving the<br>
voltages and/or currents on the power line. The output status indication bits<br>
may be used for various control, status, indication and protection functions.<br>
Examples of protection functions include permissive overreaching transfer trip<br>
(POTT) actions, permissive under-reaching transfer trip (PUTT) actions,<br>
directional comparison unblocking (DCUB) and direct transfer trip (DTT)<br>
actions. Other relay-to-relay operations are possible using particular output<br>
status indication bits.<br>
[004]	"1 he advantage of the communication system described in the 750<br>
application is that it is fast and secure. Protective relays typically accomplish<br>
their monitoring functions several times each power system cycle. The 750<br>
communication system provides the results of these monitoring functions of one<br>
relay, to the other relay. The information is transmitted directly over a<br>
communications link from an originating relay which may or may not trip its<br>
associated circuit breaker based on its operational results, to another relay.<br>
2<br><br>
The receiving relay then uses the transmitted information, in the form of digital<br>
bits, to perform its own on-going calculations, producing various protection<br>
actions such as tripping and closing a circuit breaker when appropriate. The<br>
communication between the two relays may be bi-directional, allowing the two<br>
relays to exchange information concerning the results of their own calculations<br>
both quickly and securely, with a minimum amount of expense.<br>
[005]	In the 750 application, the output status indication capability is eight bits.<br>
In many cases, however, eight channels are not necessary. For example, two<br>
or three bits are usually sufficient to accomplish the desired relay-to-relay<br>
protection, control, and monitoring scheme. A substantial number of bits<br>
therefore may go unused. The present invention makes use of those otherwise<br>
unused bits. It forms a serial data stream or channel from each unused bit, and<br>
utilizes those serial data channels to significantly increase the amount of<br>
information that can be communicated between the two relays. This invention<br>
may utilize none, some or all of the eight channels to transfer output status<br>
indication bits. If less than all eight channels are used for output status<br>
indication bits, the otherwise unused channels may be used to transfer other<br>
selected information.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

receipt of the channel data by the first receive module is adjustable based on an<br>
assignment of the channel data as a plurality of serial messages to the plurality<br>
of data channels of the first transmit module.<br>
[007]	In another embodiment, provided is a relay-to-relay direct communication<br>
system in a power system. The relay-to-relay direct communication system<br>

transmit module includes a first microcontroller adapted to provide a plurality of<br>

microcontroller adapted to provide the plurality of data channels. The<br>
communication link is adapted to transmit a plurality of serial messages at a<br>
predicable rate where each of the plurality of serial messages is formed using<br>

communication system in a power system. The relay-to-relay direct<br>
communication system includes a first protective relay having a first transmit<br>
module where the first transmit module includes a first microcontroller adapted<br>

using channel data bits corresponding to the channel data. A speed of receipt<br>
of the channel data by the first receive module is adjustable based on an<br>
assignment of the channel data to the plurality of data channels of the first<br>
transmit module. Each of the first and second microcontrollers is further<br>
adapted to provide communication link monitoring capability via detection of<br>
corrupted serial messages and missing serial messages of the plurality of serial<br>
5<br><br>
messages, and to calculate communication link availability based on a number<br>

plurality of data channels and has a second protective relay directly coupled to<br>
the first protective relay via a communication link. The second protective relay<br>
includes a second microcontroller that is adapted to provide the plurality of data<br>
channels where each of the plurality of data channels is associated with<br>
channel data having a variety of bit-lengths. The method includes converting<br>
the channel data into a plurality of serial messages, transmitting, via the<br>
communication link, each of the plurality of serial messages at a predictable<br>
rate, determining an aggregate number of received uncorrupted serial<br>
messages, and dividing the aggregate number of serial messages received<br>
during a time period by a number serial messages expected to be received<br>
during the time period.<br>

be utilized in a typical wide area.<br>

invention.<br>
[0012]	FIGURE 3 is an exemplary received frame of the relay-to-relay direct<br>
communication system of FIG. 2, according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]	As indicated above, the present invention is based on and is an<br>
improvement of the communication system of U.S. Pat. No. 5,793,750, which<br>
includes a direct communication link between two protective relays serving an<br>
electric power apparatus, the system supporting a communication arrangement<br>
or protocol involving eight data channels for exchange of output status<br>
indication bits between the two relays both quickly and securely. The channel<br>
data bits TMB1-TMB8 identify eight transmit bits, on eight data channels.<br>
[0014]	! hose bits, when received by the other relay, are identified as received<br>
channel data bits RMB1-RMB8, wherein RMB1-RMB8 are the "mirror" or replica<br>
of the transmit channel data bits. The eight data channels can accommodate at<br>
least eight output status indication bits. As indicated above, however, in many<br>
iwo-relay arrangements, only two or perhaps three channels are necessary to<br>
communicate the output status indication bits. Utilizing the present invention,<br>
the otherwise vacant channel space may now be used by selected additional<br>
data (discussed below) and an associated synchronization channel to<br>
synchronize the additional data.<br>
7<br><br>
[0015]	I he additional data may be digitized analog quantities, such as metering<br>
data, or may be "virtual terminal" data. In a virtual terminal arrangement, a<br>
human user or another application utilizes the direct communication link to<br>
communicate with the other relay. For example, the human user could utilize<br>
the direct communications link to control or query the other relay. An<br>
application such as, for example, an integration protocol like as DNP3, could<br>
also utilize the communications link in the virtual terminal arrangement.<br>
[0016]	FIGURE 1 is a single line schematic diagram of a power system 10 that<br>
may be utilized in a typical wide area. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the power system<br>
10 includes, among other things, two generators 12 configured to generate<br>
three-phase sinusoidal waveforms, for example, three-phase 12 kV sinusoidal<br>
waveforms, two step-up power transformers 14 configured to increase the 12kV<br>
sinusoidal waveforms to a higher voltage such as 138 kV and a number of<br>
circuit breakers 18. The step-up power transformers 14 provide the higher<br>
voltage sinusoidal waveforms to a number of long distance transmission lines<br>
such as the transmission lines 20. In an embodiment, a first substation 16 may<br>
be defined to include the generators 12, the step-up transformers 14 and the<br>
circuit breakers 18, all interconnected via a first bus 19. At the end of the long<br>
distance transmission lines 20, a second substation 22 includes step-down<br>
power transformers 24 to transform the higher voltage sinusoidal waveforms to<br>
lower voltage sinusoidal waveforms (e.g., 15 kV) suitable for distribution via a<br>
distribution line to various end users 26 and loads 30.<br>
8<br><br>
[0017]	As previously mentioned, the power system 10 includes protective<br>
devices and procedures to protect the power system elements from faults or<br>
other abnormal conditions The protective devices and procedures utilize a<br>
variety of protective logic schemes to determine whether a fault or other<br>
problem exists in the power system 10. For example, some types of protective<br>
relays utilize a current differential comparison to determine whether a fault<br>
exists in the protection zone. Other types of protective relays compare the<br>
magnitudes of calculated phasors, representative of the power system<br>
sinusoidal waveforms, to determine whether a fault exists in the protection<br>
zone. I requency sensing techniques and harmonic content detection is also<br>
incorporated in protective relays to detect fault conditions. Similarly, thermal<br>
model schemes are utilized by protective relays to determine whether a thermal<br>
problem exists in the protection zone.<br>
[0018]	Referring again to FIG. 1, also included are a first and a second<br>
protective relay 100 and 102 adapted to provide for example, overcurrent<br>
protection for the transmission line 21. As described below, the first and<br>
second protective relays 100, 102 are also adapted to communicate via a<br>
communication link 34 that may be configured using one of a number of<br>
suitable media. Additional protective relays such as a protective relay 104,<br>
adapted to communicate with the first protective relay 100 and/or the second<br>
protective relay 102, may also be included in the power system 10.<br>
[0019]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a relay-to-relay direct communication system<br>
40 of the power system 10, according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
9<br><br>
Although illustrated using the first and second protective relays 100, 102, it<br>
should be understood that the relay-to-relay direct communication system 40<br>
may include additional protective relays operatively coupled to the first and/or<br>
second relay 100, 102 and adapted to operate as described below. Further,<br>
although illustrated using the first and second protective relays 100, 102, it<br>
should be understood that the apparatus and method described herein is<br>
applicable communication between to any intelligent electronic device (IED) of<br>
the power system 10.<br>
[0020]	For ease of discussion, the first protective relay 100 is shown as the<br>
transmitting relay and includes, inter alia, a "transmit" module 41, having a<br>
microcontroller 42 operatively coupled to a receive and transmit interface<br>
means; in this example, a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART)<br>
43. The (transmitting) UART 43 is configured to convert bytes of channel data<br>
bits (corresponding to the channel data) resulting from first protective relay<br>
operation into a single serial message stream for outbound transmission via the<br>
communication link 34 to the second protective relay 102, and to convert an<br>
inbound serial message stream (from the second protective relay 102) into<br>
bytes of channel data suitable for use by the first protective relay 100.<br>
[0021]	Similarly, the second protective relay 102 is shown as the receiving relay<br>
and includes, inter alia, a "receive" module 44 having a second microcontroller<br>
45 operatively coupled to another UART 46, operational and configured as<br>
described above. Although not separately illustrated, each of the first and<br>
second protective relays 100, 102 include both transmit and receive capability<br>
10<br><br>
to enable bi-directional communication. While illustrated as transmit and<br>
receive modules 41, 44, in a functional block diagram format, the relay-to-relay<br>
direct communication system and method described herein may be enabled via<br>
a microprocessor or field programmable gate array (FPGA) executing a<br>
computer program, protection algorithm or relay logic scheme. Further,<br>
although illustrated as a UART 43 operatively coupled to the first microcontroller<br>
42, and a UART 46 operatively coupled to the second microcontroller 45, one of<br>
any suitable transmit and receive interface means may be utilized to convert<br>
bytes of channel data bits into a serial message stream for transmission via the<br>
communication link 34.<br>
[0022]	1 he transmit module 41 and the receive module 44 are operatively<br>
connected via the communication link 34. As noted above, the communication<br>
link 34 may be enabled as an RF link, a microwave link, an audio link, a fiber<br>
optic link, or another other type of suitable link adapted to carry serial data. As<br>
illustrated, in addition to output status indication bits, each of the transmit and<br>
receive modules 41, 44 is capable of transmitting/receiving other types of<br>
channel data in the form of serial messages. For example, the channel data<br>
may include digitized analog values, derived from analog quantities, that require<br>
more than a single bit such as metering information, breaker failure system<br>
security enhancement information, reclose enable information, instrument<br>
transfotmer checking and multi-terminal fault location information, to name a<br>
tew.<br>
11<br><br>
[0023]	Referring to the transmit module 41, an eight data channel arrangement<br>
is configured such that two data channels, a data channel 47 and a data<br>
channel 48, correspond to the conventional output status indication bits 57<br>
transmitted as channel data bit 1 (TMB1) and TMB2, respectively, from the<br>
transmit module 41 of the first protective relay 100 to the receive module 44 of<br>
the second protective relay 102. Three data channels, a data channel 49, a<br>
data channel 50 and a data channel 51, are dedicated to digitized analog<br>
values 59, 60 and 61 transmitted as channel data bits TMB3, TMB4 and TMB5,<br>
respectively, from the transmit module 41 of the first protective relay 100 to the<br>
receive module 44 of the second protective relay 102.<br>
[0024]	I ach of the digitized analog values 59, 60, 61 are formed by, for<br>
example, converting a 32-bit floating point number representing an analog<br>
quantity (e.g., system impedances, currents, voltages)) into an 18-bit floating<br>
point number. The 18-bit floating point number is then serialized such that one<br>
bit from each of the digitized analog values 59, 60, 61 is included as channel<br>
data bits TMB3, TMB4 and TMB5, respectively, in sequential transmitted<br>
messages until all of the bits associated with the digitized analog values 59, 60,<br>
61 are transmitted. For example, if each of the digitized analog values 59, 60,<br>
61 is expressed in 18 bits, eighteen sequential serial messages are transmitted<br>
where the first serial message includes the first bit of the digitized analog value<br>
59 transmitted as channel data bit TMB3, the first bit of the digitized analog<br>
value 60 transmitted as channel data bit TMB4, and the first bit of the digitized<br>
analog value 61 transmitted as channel data bit TMB5. Similarly, the second<br>
12<br><br>
serial message includes the second bit of the digitized analog value 59<br>
transmuted as channel data bit TMB3, the second bit of the digitized analog<br>
value 6U transmitted as channel data bit TMB4, and the second bit of the<br>
digitized analog value 61 transmitted as channel data bit TMB5, and so on.<br>
[0025]	It should be noted that while compromising some precision, the<br>
conversion scheme that converts a 32-bit floating point number (representing<br>
the analog quantity) into a corresponding 18-bit floating point number, enables<br>
quicker transmission to the second protective relay 102. It should also be noted<br>
that other conversion schemes may be utilized depending on the analog<br>
quantity measured, the precision required, and the speed of transmission<br>
desired<br>
[0026]	I wo additional data channels, a data channel 52 and a data channel 53<br>
facilitate virtual terminal data transmitted as channel data bits TMB6 and<br>
TMB7, respectively, from the transmit module 41 of the first protective relay 100<br>
to the receive module 44 of the second protective relay 102. As noted above,<br>
virtual terminal data refers to data provided by a user located at a local relay<br>
(e.g., the first relay 100), to a remote relay (e.g., the second relay 102) via the<br>
communication link 34. In such a configuration, the local relay operates as a<br>
virtual terminal to allow the user to query and/or control the remote relay with<br>
the familiar serial port user interface passing data on otherwise unused<br>
channels. The virtual terminal scheme also adds fast meter/operate capability.<br>
Like the digitized analog values described above, the virtual terminal data is<br>
serialized bit-by-bit such that, for example, 18-bit virtual terminal data is<br>
13<br><br>
transmitted bit-by-bit in 18 sequential serial messages where the first two bits<br>
are payload flags and the last sixteen bits are two 8-bit data bytes. For<br>
example, the 18-bit virtual terminal data may be expressed as:<br>
l)l!&gt;,dU)ddltdv.drdndU)di)dHd.ldbddid,d2d]\Nhere p indicates that 
payload byte, p,- indicates that d9 d]6 is a payload byte (see, FIG. 3).<br>
[0027]	I he eighth data channel 54 is dedicated to synchronization information<br>
transmitted as channel data bit TMB8 from the transmit module 41 of the first<br>
protective relay 100 to the receive module 44 of the second protective relay<br>
102. I he synchronization information enables synchronization of the data<br>
channels associated with the analog values 59, 60, 61 and the virtual terminal<br>
data 62 Thus, when any of the data channels 47-53 are used for anything<br>
other than the output status indication bits, a dedicated synchronous channel is<br>
allocated for synchronization information transmitted as channel data bit TMB8.<br>
[0028]	Although illustrated utilizing an eight data channel arrangement, it should<br>
be understood that a different number or arrangement and/or assignment of<br>
data channels may be used by the first and second protective relays 100, 102<br>
of the communication system 40. Accordingly, the two data channels of output<br>
status indication bits in combination with the three data channels of analog<br>
values and the two data channels of virtual terminal data illustrated in FIG. 2 is<br>
arbitrary. The output status indication bits could occupy more or less or no data<br>
channels, the analog values could occupy more or less or no data channels,<br>
and the virtual terminal data could occupy more or less or no data channels. In<br>
addition, one analog value may occupy more than one data channel for<br>
14<br><br>
speedier transmission. Similarly, virtual terminal data may occupy more than<br>
one data channel for speedier transmission.<br>
[0029]	i urther, in an embodiment, the arrangement and/or assignment of the<br>
data channels may be fixed, while in another embodiment, the arrangement<br>
and/or assignment of the data channels may be dynamically changed during<br>
relay operation, depending on the desired configuration of the protective<br>
relay(s) 100, 102. As a result, speed of receipt of the channel data by the<br>
receive module 44 is adjustable based on the assignment of the channel data to<br>
the number of data channels.<br>
[0030]	I or example, if 18-bit virtual terminal data is dynamically assigned to one<br>
data channel during a high activity period of relay operation, it is transmitted bit-<br>
by-bit in 18 sequential serial messages, and then reassembled for use by the<br>
receiving relay. If one message is transmitted every 1 millisecond via the<br>
communication link 34, 18 milliseconds are required for receipt of the entire 18-<br>
bit virtual terminal data. In contrast, if the same 18-bit virtual terminal data is<br>
dynamically assigned to three data channels during a lower activity period of<br>
relay operation, it is transmitted bit-by-bit in 6 sequential serial messages,<br>
requiring six milliseconds.<br>
[0031]	Prior to transmission, each of the eight channel data bits TMB1-TMB8<br>
are encoded by an encoder 65 to form an encoded message 66 using one of<br>
any number of suitable techniques. The encoded message 66 may therefore<br>
have one of any number of suitable formats, depending on the encoding<br>
scheme selected. For example, in one encoding scheme, the encoded<br>
15<br><br>
message 66 may include 36 or 40 bits, divided into four 9-bit (for 36 bit length)<br>
or 10-bit (for 40 bit length) characters plus a number of idle bits. The number of<br>
idle bits may vary depending upon the selected transmission speed.<br>
[0032]	Continuing with the example, the bits may be assembled such that the<br>
first 9 10 bit character includes a single start bit followed by the six channel data<br>
bits TMB1-TMB6, followed by an odd parity bit and one or two stop bits, as<br>
selected by the user. The second character may include a second single start<br>
bit, followed by the six channel data bits TMB5, TMB6, TMB7, TMB8, TMB1<br>
and TMB2, followed by an odd parity bit and one or two stop bits. The third<br>
character may include a start bit followed by the six channel data bits TMB7,<br>
TMB8, TMB1, TMB2, TMB3 and TMB4, followed by an odd parity bit and one or<br>
two stop bits. The fourth and final character in the message may include a<br>
single start bit followed by the six channel data bits TMB3-TMB8, followed by an<br>
odd panty bit and one or two stop bits. The remaining bits, if any, are a variable<br>
number of idle bits, depending upon transmission speed of the data.<br>
[0033]	Using such an encoding scheme, each of the channel data bits TMB1-<br>
TMB8 are repeated three times in the four character portions of one encoded<br>
message 66 with single stop and parity bits and one or two stop bits inserted<br>
between each character portion of the encoded message 66. This encoding<br>
scheme allows the receiving, or second protective relay 102, to check for errors<br>
that may have occurred during transmission.<br>
[0034]	In addition to assembling the bits into messages, each of the first and<br>
second protective relays 100, 102 may be adapted to further encode and<br>
16<br><br>
decode using an identifier pattern selected during system configuration. For<br>
example, if preprogrammed to include one particular identifier pattern, the<br>
transmit encoder 65 logically inverts one of the four characters in each of the<br>
messages as a means of encoding the identifier pattern into the message. As<br>
described below, the receiving, or second, relay 102 then ensures that the<br>
received message has been encoded with the correct identifier pattern.<br>
Although described as assembling messages where one character is logically<br>
inverted, it should be understood that other suitable formats and encoding<br>
schemes may be utilized by the encoder 65 to generate the encoded message<br>
66.<br>
[0035]	i he encoded message 66 is then applied to the UART 43, adapted to<br>
satisfy several operating parameters for the system. In general, the UART 43<br>
converts the encoded message 66 into a serial message 67 for transmission as<br>
part of a serial message stream via the communication link 34. Accordingly, the<br>
receiving UART 46 must also be capable of checking the received serial<br>
message 67 for proper framing (the presence of one stop bit per byte) and<br>
proper parity, and detecting overrun errors.<br>
[0036]	The UART 43 may be programmed for various baud rates. For example,<br>
it might be programmed for baud rates ranging from 300 through 115,000. The<br>
UART 43 is additionally adapted to synchronize both transmit and receive<br>
serial messages using transmit and receive clocks externally supplied. As will<br>
be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the method of bit synchronization, using<br>
17<br><br>
start and stop bits or using synchronizing clocks, is one of any number of<br>
suitable methods for synchronization.<br>
[0037]	Subsequent to being prepared for transmission by the UART 43, the<br>
serial message 67 is transmitted over the communication link 34 to the receive<br>
module 44. In one example, when the first, or transmitting, relay 100 samples<br>
and performs its monitoring functions every {fraction (1/16)}th of a power<br>
system cycle, each serial message 67 is sent at a 1 millisecond interval,<br>
reflecting the sampling rate of the transmitting relay. The sampling and<br>
transmission rates can be varied depending on the desired operation of the<br>
transmitting relay.<br>
[0038]	Referring now to the receive module 44, the receiving UART 46 provides<br>
the counterpart functions of the transmitting UART 43. When the serial<br>
message 67 is received by the receive module 44 of the second relay 102,, the<br>
UART 46 performs several data checks on each character of the serial<br>
message 67. It also checks each character of the serial messages 67 for<br>
proper framing, parity and overrun errors.<br>
[0039]	From UART 46, the characters of the serial message 67 are passed to a<br>
decoder 68. In general, the decoder 68 reassembles groups of four characters<br>
in order to reconstruct the four character message. Next, the decoder 68<br>
checks each message for errors, and also examines the results of the UART<br>
checks described above. If any of the checks fail, the decoder 68 discards the<br>
message and de-asserts a DOK (data OK) flag 94 for that message in a register<br>
95 {see, FIG. 3).<br>
18<br><br>
[0040]	More specifically, in the illustrated example, the decoder 68 ensures that<br>
there are the three copies of the eight channel data bits TMB1-TMB8 included<br>
in the transmitted four-character encoded message 66. If an identifier pattern<br>
was used to encode the encoded message 66, the decoder 68 also checks to<br>
ensure that the encoded message 66 includes the identifier pattern. It should<br>
be noted that the encoding/decoding scheme described above is one of any<br>
number of suitable encoding/decoding schemes to enable error detection that<br>
may be utilized in the method and apparatus of the invention.<br>
[0041]	As a result of operation of the decoder 68, the DOK flag 94 and the<br>
channel data bits RMB1-RMB8 are provided. The received channel data bits<br>
RMB1-RMB8 are the mirror or replica of transmitted channel data bits TMB1-<br>
TMB8. The data OK (DOK) flag 94 provides an indication of whether errors<br>
were detected in the received message.<br>
[0042]	I ike the transmit module 41 of the first relay 102, the receive module 44<br>
of the second relay 102 includes an eight data channel arrangement where two<br>
data channels are dedicated to the output status indication bits, three data<br>
channels are dedicated to three digitized analog values, two data channels are<br>
dedicated to virtual terminal data and one data channel is dedicated to<br>
synchronization information Accordingly, the output status indication bits 57<br>
are received as channel data bits RMB1 and RMB2 via data channels 70 and<br>
71, respectively, and are applied to one or more security counters 69. The<br>
security counters 69 operate to ensure that the state of the received channel<br>
data bits RMB1 and RMB2 remain constant for a pre-selected number of<br>
19<br><br>
received serial messages 67 before the output status indication bits are utilized<br>
by downstream processes. Ensuring that the state of the output status<br>
indication bits remain constant increases the reliability and security associated<br>
with the output status indication bits 57.<br>
[0043]	Because the two channel data bits RMB1 and RMB2 are transmitted bit<br>
by bit, no synchronization of those bits is required. The channel data bits RMB1<br>
and RMB2 are used by the second relay 102 to make determinations<br>
concerning operation of the power system 10 (as detected by the first protective<br>
relay 100) including possible circuit breaker trip action when appropriate. In the<br>
illustrated example, the digitized analog values 59, 60 and 61 are received as<br>
channel data bits RMB3, RMB4, and RMB5 via a data channel 72, a channel 73<br>
and a channel 74, respectively. Each of the three digitized analog values 59,<br>
60, 61 are received serially one bit per message per data channel, and are then<br>
parallelized in a parallelize element 78. The parallelize element 78 re-<br>
assembles each of the three digitized analog values from received successive<br>
decoded messages 58. As noted above, in the illustrated example, each of the<br>
digitized analog values 59, 60, 61 includes eighteen bits. In an embodiment,<br>
sixteen bits are used for information while the remaining two bits are unused.<br>
Therefore, for every 18 messages, a complete original analog value is received<br>
on eachi corresponding data channel.<br>
[0044]	Similarly, the virtual terminal data 62 is received as channel data bits<br>
RMB6 and RMB7 via data channels 75 and 76, respectively. Like the analog<br>
values 59, 60, 61, the virtual terminal data 62 is received serially one bit per<br>
20<br><br>
message per data channel, and is also parallelized in the parallelize element<br>
78. In the illustrated embodiment, the virtual terminal data 62 includes eighteen<br>
bits. Sixteen bits of the eighteen bits are utilized for virtual terminal data, where<br>
the sixteen bits are divided into two eight-bit bytes. The two remaining bits are<br>
used to indicate which of the two eight-bit byte fields actually contain virtual<br>
terminal data, and which, if any, are idle, (e.g., waiting for user input). Thus, for<br>
every 18 decoded messages 58, two virtual terminal bytes are received on each<br>
corresponding data channel 75, 76. After parallelization via the parallelize<br>
element 78, the analog values and the virtual terminal data are provided to the<br>
second protective relay 102<br>
[0045]	Again, the particular arrangement of the eight data channel bits TMB1 -<br>
TMB8 is established in accordance with the user's communication<br>
requirements. Different numbers of output status indication bits, analog values<br>
and virtual terminal data can be utilized to form seven bits of the eight channel<br>
data bits TMB1-TMB8.<br>
[0046]	A data channel 77, or synchronization channel, is dedicated to the<br>
remaining channel data bit, RMB8. The channel data bits RMB8 of the<br>
synchronization channel enable the receiving decoder 68 and parallelize<br>
element 78 to find the start and stop boundaries serial messages that include<br>
the digitized analog values and virtual terminal data. The synchronization<br>
channel is necessary when any of the other channel data bits include the<br>
digitized analog values or the virtual terminal data. If all of the channel data bits<br>
21<br><br>
are used for output status indication bits only, no synchronization is necessary<br>
and the data channel 77 may be used for output status indication bits.<br>
[0047]	In order to determine that a complete (four character) bit message has<br>
been received, the second relay 102 identifies the first byte of each of the bit<br>
messages via message synchronization. In an embodiment, message<br>
synchronization is maintained by counting modulo 4 from the first received byte<br>
after byte synchronization is achieved. Accordingly, each time the counter rolls<br>
over, the first byte is received.<br>
[0048]	FIG. 3 is an exemplary received frame 80 of the relay-to-relay direct<br>
communication system 40, according to an embodiment of the invention. As<br>
illustrated, the received frame 80 includes 18 messages where a series of the<br>
"bottom" channel data bit (TMB8) provides the 18-bit synchronization<br>
information after encoding, transmission and decoding. In addition, the analog<br>
values and virtual terminal data are received as channel data bits RMB3-RMB7<br>
via data channels 72-76.<br>
[0049]	Referring to the data channel 77, or the synchronization channel, a<br>
special frame synchronization pattern, for example 000001, is utilized to<br>
indicate that all other data channels (e.g., data channels 70-76) are at the<br>
beginning of a frame. In the illustrated example, when the last six bits received<br>
on the synchronization channel are 000001 (the 1 being most recent), then the<br>
other data channels are determined to be at a frame boundary. For example,<br>
the synchronization channel may be expressed as ddddddxlj I/;/()()()()() I<br>
where,  = virtual terminal data, 1 = binary one, 0 = binary zero, /; = 1 indicates<br>
22<br><br>
that the virtual terminal data is valid, vis a virtual terminal flag byte; it is<br>
normally 1, but is set to 0 to indicate a special flag byte is in the virtual terminal<br>
data, and /= time sync bit.<br>
[0050]	A comparator 91 in Fig. 3 is adapted to enable detection of the special<br>
frame synchronization pattern in the six most recently received channel data<br>
bits (from the six most recently received messages). Upon detecting the<br>
special frame synchronization pattern via operation of the comparator 91, a<br>
modulo 18 counter 92 is interrogated. If the modulo 18 counter 92 is not zero, it<br>
is reset io zero and the data on the synchronization, virtual terminal data and<br>
analog value channels {i.e., channels 72-77) since the last valid frame sync<br>
(FS) signal 97 is discarded. Therefore, if the modulo 18 counter 92 is at zero, if<br>
all of the 18 most recent data OK (DOK) flags in register 95 are valid (e.g., a<br>
binary 1 value) and if the comparator 91 is asserted indicating detection of the<br>
special frame synchronization pattern, then an AND-gate 96 asserts the FS<br>
signal 97, resulting in the analog values and virtual terminal data being utilized<br>
by the receiving, or second relay 102.<br>
[0051]	I he synchronization channel, dedicated to the channel data bit RMB8,<br>
includes an additional virtual terminal character separated into two four-bit<br>
segments 80 and 82. Further, a bit 84 has a binary 1 value if the additional<br>
virtual terminal character contains valid data, and has binary 0 value if the<br>
additional virtual terminal character is idle (such as might be the case if the<br>
virtual terminal session is waiting for input from the user). A bit 85 of the<br>
synchronization channel 77 has a binary 1 value, and a bit 86 typically has a<br>
23<br><br>
binary 1 value, except under special conditions described below. When both of<br>
the bits 84 and 85 have a binary 1 value, five consecutive zeros in the<br>
synchronization channel are not possible. This ensures that the frame<br>
synchronization pattern 000001 detected by comparator 91 can only occur at<br>
frame boundaries.<br>
[0052]	1 he additional terminal character contained in half-bytes 80 and 82 can<br>
also include control characters, intended to indicate from one relay<br>
(transmitting) to the other (receiving) when virtual terminal communication<br>
should be established, terminated, paused, etc. When one of these control<br>
characters is included in the additional virtual terminal character, bit 86 is forced<br>
to a binary 0 value. The special control characters are chosen carefully by the<br>
system designer such that, even with bit 86 at the binary 0 value, the frame<br>
synchronization pattern 000001 can only occur at a frame boundary.<br>
[0053]	In addition, a bit T 98 in the synchronization channel comprises a<br>
separate serial data stream, transmitted at the rate of one bit per 18 messages<br>
(frame) This separate serial data stream contains date and time information.<br>
Each time the FS signal 97 asserts, a time synchronization device 88 accepts<br>
the bit I 98. An additional frame synchronization system, similar to the frame<br>
synchronization system described above, allows the time synchronization<br>
device 88 to recognize the boundaries between successive time<br>
synchronization messages. Namely, a specific frame synchronization pattern is<br>
placed in the serial data stream formed by the bit t 98 {i.e., a bit t serial data<br>
stream) A comparator detects the specific frame synchronization pattern, and<br>
24<br><br>
signals that the time-of-day and calendar day information, contained in the bit T<br>
serial data stream may be used. The data included in the bit T serial data<br>
stream is formatted such that the frame synchronization pattern can only occur<br>
at frame boundaries. The time synchronization device 88 then updates the<br>
time-of-day clock and the calendar day with the time-of-day and calendar day<br>
information contained in the bit T serial data stream.<br>
[0054]	Unlike control inputs of typical protective relays, the relay-to-relay direct<br>
communication system disclosed herein includes communication link monitoring<br>
capability via detection of corrupted serial messages when they occur. That is,<br>
when a corrupted serial message is received by the receive module 44, it may<br>
be concluded by the receive module that the corrupted serial message is the<br>
result of faulty operation or degradation of the communication link 34 and/or<br>
associated transmission equipment. Suitable alarming may be utilized to notify<br>
the user of the condition where the communication link 34 and/or associated<br>
equipment remains faulty for a predetermined duration.<br>
[0055]	The relay-to-relay direct communication system disclosed herein also<br>
includes communication link monitoring via detection of missing serial<br>
messages. Because, the serial messages 67 are transmitted via the<br>
communication link 34 at pre-determined periodic intervals, or at a predictable<br>
rate, it can be concluded by the receive module that the missing serial<br>
message(s) 67 is/(are) the result of faulty operation or degradation of the<br>
communication link 34 and/or associated transmission equipment. For<br>
example, if the transmit module 41 is transmitting 250 serial messages every<br>
25<br><br>
second (a rate of one message every 4 milliseconds), and the receive module<br>
44 does not receive a serial message in an 8 millisecond period, a problem with<br>
the communication link and/or associated equipment may be concluded. In<br>
both instances, the DOK flag 94 indicates the problem with the communication<br>
link 34 and/or associated equipment, and the received analog values and/or<br>
virtual terminal data is not utilized by the receiving relay (see, FIG. 3).<br>
[0056]	The relay-to-relay direct communication system disclosed herein further<br>
includes an ability to determine communication link availability, or channel<br>
availability, defined as that portion of time the communication link 34 and/or<br>
associated equipment is capable of properly delivering uncorrupted serial<br>
messages 67. Communication link availability may be calculated by dividing<br>
the aggregate number of all of the received uncorrupted serial messages by the<br>
total expected serial messages in a recording period. For example, for a<br>
recording period of 24 hours, at 250 serial messages per second the<br>
transmitting module 41 transmits 21,600,000 messages and the receive module<br>
44 receives 21,590,000 serial messages 67 because 9000 of the serial<br>
messages were corrupted and 1000 of the serial messages were missing. The<br>
channel availability would therefore be 21,590,000/21,600,000 = 99.9537%.<br>
Suitable alarming may be utilized to notify the user when the channel availability<br>
falls below a predetermined threshold.<br>
[0057]	As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, variations of availability<br>
calculations are possible such as, for example, counting received frames 80 to<br>
determine availability of the digitized analog values and/or virtual terminal data.<br>
26<br><br>
For example, because18 received frames are needed to reconstruct an 18-bit<br>
digitized analog value, receipt of only 17 of the 18 frames would indicate an<br>
analog value availability of 94.44%.<br>
[0058]	Accordingly, the relay-to-relay direct communication system disclosed<br>
herein is adapted to (1) directly communicate output status indication bits which<br>
represent the result of protection functions by one of the relays, (2) directly<br>
communicate selected analog values representing one or more functions of the<br>
relay, (3) directly communicate virtual terminal data provided by a user to one of<br>
the relays via the other relay, (4) monitor the communication link between the<br>
two relays, (5) determine communication link availability and (6) provide time<br>
synchronization. The analog values and the virtual terminal data are processed<br>
in serial fashion in successive messages on channels not used by the output<br>
status indication bits. The time synchronization data is processed in serial<br>
fashion in successive frames (18 messages) of data.<br>
[0059]	As noted above, the number of and assignment of data channels for the<br>
output status indication bits and the additional data (analog values and virtual<br>
terminal data) may be pre-selected by an operator or may be dynamically<br>
selected during relay operation. The additional data may include analog values<br>
only, virtual terminal data only or a combination of analog values and virtual<br>
terminal data. The synchronization channel is dedicated for purposes of<br>
synchronizing the additional data, to transmit/receive additional virtual terminal<br>
data, time information and calendar (date) information. This results in the<br>
channel capability of the basic transmission arrangement disclosed in the 750<br>
27<br><br>
patent being used to its maximum extent, while providing the benefits of the<br>
existing fast and highly secure transmission of output status indication bits.<br>
[0060]	Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed<br>
here for purposes of illustration, it should be understood that various changes,<br>
modifications and substitutions may be incorporated in the embodiment without<br>
departing from the spirit of the invention, which is defined by the claims which<br>
