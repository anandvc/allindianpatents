				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DIAMOND DISC<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a diamond disc mounted to a disc<br>
grinder or the like which is a hand-held rotating tool (hand-held rotating<br>
device) to, for example, grind (herein and in the claims, "grind" is meant<br>
to include "cut" except for a specified case) materials to be ground such<br>
as concrete or stone.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Various diamond discs constructed such that a plurality of<br>
diamond grains are bound, except for a center region, on a disc front<br>
surface of a circular base formed of a steel plate or the like to be arranged<br>
at appropriate intervals by brazing, laser welding, or an adhesive (binder)<br>
have been put into practical use (see Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. Hei. 6 -210571 and Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 2000-167774).<br>
Such a diamond disc is mounted to a rotating shaft of a hand-held<br>
rotating device such as a disc grinder by a mounting hole formed at the<br>
center region of the base and is rotated at a predetermined speed, to<br>
thereby cause the disc surface to grind materials to be ground (polished),<br>
for example, concrete, stone, tile, or coatings applied to their surfaces.<br>
The diamond discs vary sizes (diameters) or configurations of discs, sizes<br><br>
or arrangement densities of the diamond grains bound on the disc<br>
surfaces, according to uses.<br>
The conventional diamond discs have technical problems as<br>
described below.<br>
First, diamond grains having a relatively large size are bound with<br>
a small distance and uniform density on the same rotational track, a<br>
rearward diamond is positioned behind a forward diamond on a common<br>
rotational track in actual grinding. In such a case, the rearward<br>
diamond tends not to serve to perform grinding efficiently, which reduces<br>
entire grinding efficiency. In particular, such a tendency is noticeable<br>
in grinding relatively adhesive materials, which are represented by<br>
peeling or the like of, for example, elastic coatings.<br>
In the above mentioned construction, the diamond grains on the<br>
disc surface wear unevenly according to a degree to which they have<br>
performed grinding after a long-time use. As a result, grinding<br>
efficiency thereafter decreases and a lifetime of the diamond disc<br>
decreases.<br>
If the diamond grains are arranged on the disc surface at random<br>
without non-uniform density, ground chips which are going to be<br>
discharged from the center region side toward a peripheral edge region<br>
during grinding are likely to clog between the diamond grains, which may<br>
undesirably affect grinding efficiency.<br>
Second, numerous diamond grains may be bound on the disc<br>
surface so as to be arranged to individually draw rotational tracks to<br>
enhance grinding ability. But, if the diamond grains thus increase and<br><br>
are arranged as described above, arrangement and fixing of the diamond<br>
grains which are performed in a manufacturing process become<br>
burdensome and significantly reduces productivity.<br>
Third, if the diamond grains arranged on a peripheral region of the<br>
disc surface wear while the diamond grains arranged in a center region of<br>
the disc surface and a region in the vicinity thereof do not substantially<br>
wear after grinding, such a diamond disc may be undesirably discarded<br>
without efficient use of resources.<br>
Fourth, the conventional diamond discs are used exclusively for<br>
grinding, including chamfering or the like by the disc surface, and are<br>
not configured for other uses.<br>
The present invention has been made under the circumstances,<br>
and a first object of the present invention is to provide a grinding<br>
diamond disc which is used as in conventional commercially available<br>
diamond discs, which enables all diamond grains to perform grinding<br>
efficiently and uniformly, which is less likely to unevenly wear the<br>
diamond grains after a long-time use, and which is capable of efficiently<br>
discharging ground chips from a center region to an outer peripheral<br>
region of a disc surface thereof.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide a grinding<br>
diamond disc which is easily positioning diamond grains on the disc<br>
surface regardless of the number of and arrangement of diamond grains<br>
bound on the disc surface.<br>
A third object of the present invention is to provide a grinding<br>
diamond disc which allows a manufacture or the like of the diamond disc<br><br>
to be easily identified by its external appearance using diamond grains<br>
whose grinding amount (load) is smaller, among the diamond grains<br>
bound on the disc surface, and which is novel and superior in design.<br>
A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a grinding<br>
diamond disc which can be configured for uses other than grinding in a<br>
limited sense on the disc surface.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
In order to achieve the first object, a grinding diamond disc of a<br>
first invention comprises: a plurality of diamond grains bound on a<br>
grinding surface of the disc, wherein a distance between diamond grains<br>
which are located forward and rearward in a rotational direction on a<br>
common rotational track is set longer than a distance between diamond<br>
grains which are located on adjacent rotational tracks in a radial<br>
direction of the disc so as to be close to each other.<br>
In such a construction, since the distance between diamond<br>
grains located forward and rearward on the common rotational track is<br>
set longer than the distance between diamond grains which are located<br>
on adjacent rotational tracks so as to be close to each other, a sufficient<br>
gap is ensured between the diamond grains located forward and<br>
rearward on the common rotational track of the diamond disc in grinding<br>
concrete, stone, etc. As a result, uneven wear which would be caused<br>
by the fact that the diamond located rearward in the rotational direction<br>
is located behind the diamond located forward in the rotational direction,<br>
does not occur, and hence individual diamond grains efficiently perform<br><br>
grinding. In addition, since the gap is formed efficiently between the<br>
adjacent diamond grains in the rotational direction, ground chips are<br>
efficiently discharged. This increases grinding efficiency.<br>
Since the individual diamond grains wear substantially evenly,<br>
the diamond disc exhibits stable grinding performance for a long time<br>
period, and hence a lifetime of the diamond disc can be extended.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the plurality of diamond grains may<br>
be arranged regularly. Thereby, the ground chips are discharged<br>
smoothly and the diamond disc can be manufactured with higher yield.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the plurality of diamond grains may<br>
be arranged regularly in such a manner that a gap formed between<br>
diamond grains which are located on the adjacent rotational tracks and<br>
are located forward and rearward so as to be close to each other in the<br>
rotational direction is configured to extend continuously from an outer<br>
periphery of a center region to a peripheral edge region, and the gap<br>
extends continuously in such a manner that an outer diameter end<br>
thereof deviates from an inner diameter end thereof such that the inner<br>
diameter end is located forward in the rotational direction and the outer<br>
diameter end is located rearward in the rotational direction. Thereby,<br>
the ground chips are discharged more smoothly from the gap between<br>
the diamond grains by the rotation of the diamond disc.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the gap may be configured to extend<br>
in a swirl shape such that the outer diameter end of the gap deviates<br>
from the inner diameter end by 20 degrees or more. This enables the<br>
ground chips to be discharged more smoothly by the rotation of the<br><br>
grinding diamond disc.<br>
In order to achieve the second object, a grinding diamond disc of a<br>
second invention comprises a plurality of diamond grains bound on a<br>
grinding portion of the disc, wherein the plurality of diamond grains are<br>
bound on the grinding portion in such a manner that a plurality of<br>
adjacent diamond grains are patterned in a predetermined configuration<br>
to form diamond group units which are arranged regularly on the<br>
grinding portion.<br>
In accordance with such a construction, the diamond group units<br>
in one or plural patterns may be arranged as units on the grinding<br>
portion such as the disc surface, considering only the arrangement of the<br>
diamond units. This makes it possible that the diamond grains are<br>
positioned or bound on the grinding portion such as the disc surface<br>
quickly and easily. Since the plurality of diamond grains belonging to<br>
the same diamond group unit are arranged to be close to each other and<br>
to extend in a plane, and perform grinding as a unit, one diamond group<br>
unit may be substantially assumed as one large diamond.<br>
In addition, since the grinding diamond disc exhibits grinding<br>
performance substantially as high as that of the conventional diamond<br>
disc constructed such that the individual diamond grains are positioned<br>
with respect to the grinding portion such as the disc surface. The<br>
diamond grains are not intended to be arranged in one pattern but may<br>
be arranged in various patterns.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the diamond group units may be<br>
oriented in different directions according to grinding loads (loads) of the<br><br>
diamond grains. This changes rotational tracks of the individual<br>
diamond grains belonging to the same diamond group unit. In other<br>
words, the width of the rotational tracks of the diamond group units can<br>
be changed by orienting the diamond group units in different diamond<br>
grains. With this construction, the grinding load of the diamond grains<br>
can be adjusted. If the diamond group units are displaced from each<br>
other in the radial direction to cause the rotational tracks partially<br>
overlap with each other, the diamond group units which overlap with<br>
each other are oriented in opposite directions. Thereby, grinding<br>
uneveness is avoided, and hence difference (variation) in the grinding<br>
amount which would be caused by the difference in arrangement of the<br>
diamond grains, will not occur. As a result, the diamond grains<br>
efficiently function, and hence entire grinding efficiency increases.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the grinding portion may be formed<br>
by a substantially flat or round face, and the diamond group units may<br>
be arranged continuously in a swirl shape from an inner diameter end<br>
side of the grinding portion to an outer diameter end side thereof.<br>
Thereby, the diamond group units are easily arranged entirely in a<br>
well-balanced manner on the surface of the grinding portion (e.g., disc<br>
surface) for the purpose of practicability. In addition, the diamond disc<br>
which is easily used according to uses is easily obtained. The diamond<br>
group units may be arranged in the shape of one or more swirls.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the grinding portion may be formed<br>
by a substantially flat or round face, and the diamond group units may<br>
be arranged to have a gap which gradually decreases toward the outer<br><br>
diameter end of the grinding portion. Thereby, the diamond group units<br>
are arranged entirely in a well-balanced manner on the disc surface<br>
which is the grinding portion for the purpose of practicability (grinding).<br>
Typically, a circumferential speed of the disc increases as it is close to<br>
the outer peripheral region in the grinding portion such as the disc<br>
surface, and hence the diamond group units arranged there perform<br>
grinding with a higher degree, and bear a higher grinding load. With the<br>
above mentioned construction, this is properly performed with higher<br>
efficiency. In addition, the ground chips are discharged relatively easily<br>
from the outer peripheral region.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the diamond group units may be<br>
each formed by three diamond grains arranged in a triangle shape.<br>
Thereby, the diamond grains configured in one pattern are desirably<br>
arranged to have various orientations.<br>
In order to achieve the third object, a grinding diamond disc of a<br>
third invention comprises a plurality of diamond grains which are bound<br>
on a region of a disc surface from an outer diameter side of a center<br>
region to a peripheral edge region, and are not bound on the center<br>
region, wherein a plurality of diamond grains are arranged to form a<br>
character or a graphic drawn in a pointillist manner in at least a part of<br>
the disc surface.<br>
In accordance with the grinding diamond disc, the character or<br>
graphic drawn in the pointillist manner on the disc surface which is<br>
easily noticed during grinding can display a use, performance, a<br>
manufacture or the like of the diamond disc, and its design and its<br><br>
commercial value are improved. Further, by arranging the character or<br>
the like at a proper position, the diamond disc thus constructed exhibits<br>
grinding performance substantially as high as that of the conventional<br>
diamond disc.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the disc surface to which the<br>
plurality of diamond grains are bound may include a center side region<br>
and a peripheral side region located on an outer periphery of the center<br>
side region, and the diamond grains are arranged to form the character<br>
or the graphic drawn in the pointillist manner in the center side region.<br>
In this construction, the diamond grains are arranged to draw the<br>
character or the graphic in the pointillist manner in the center side<br>
region which is low in grinding function to improve design of the disc,<br>
and the peripheral region which is high in grinding function mainly<br>
perform grinding. As a result, thus constructed diamond disc exhibits<br>
grinding performance substantially as high as that of the conventional<br>
diamond disc. In addition, desirably, the diamond disc can be identified<br>
and its design and commercial value are improved.<br>
In order to achieve the fourth object, a grinding diamond disc of a<br>
fourth invention having a mounting hole formed in a center region<br>
recessed backward to have a predetermined depth to thereby allow the<br>
grinding diamond disc to be mounted to a rotation device (drive shaft),<br>
comprises a plurality of diamond grains bound on a region of the disc<br>
surface which is located radially outward relative to the recessed region,<br>
wherein the diamond grains are bound from an outer peripheral edge<br>
region of the disc surface to an outer peripheral edge region of a back<br><br>
surface of the disc.<br>
The diamond disc thus constructed exhibits grinding performance<br>
substantially as high as that of the conventional diamond disc, in general<br>
grinding materials to be ground such as concrete or stone using the disc<br>
surface. In addition, the outer peripheral region of the disc performs<br>
cutting in a limited sense or forms a groove with respect to the materials<br>
to be ground such as concrete or stone.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the outer peripheral region of the<br>
back surface of the disc may form a rounded surface which protrudes<br>
backward. Such a diamond disc efficiently performs cutting in a limited<br>
sense.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the diamond grains may be bound<br>
from the outer peripheral edge region of the disc surface to the outer<br>
peripheral edge region of the back surface with a uniform density over an<br>
entire circumference. Such a diamond disc exhibits high cutting<br>
performance in a limited sense.<br>
In order to achieve the fourth object, a grinding diamond disc of a<br>
fifth invention, which is circular in a front view, the grinding diamond<br>
disc having a mounting hole formed in a center region of a disc surface,<br>
comprises a protruding portion formed at a peripheral edge of the<br>
grinding diamond disc and configured to protrude forward and backward,<br>
wherein the diamond grains are bound on the protruding portion.<br>
In accordance with the diamond disc, the protruding portion<br>
efficiently performs cutting in a limited sense or forms the groove with<br>
respect to the materials to be ground such as concrete or stone. And, a<br><br>
region located radially inward relative to the protruding portion does not interfere with cutting<br>
performed by the protruding portion.<br>
In the grinding diamond disc, the diamond grains may be bound on the protruding portion<br>
intermittently. Thereby, the ground chips are efficiently discharged in cutting or forming the groove<br>
using the protruding portion<br>
Preferably, an outer peripheral edge of the protruding portion may be curved to protrude<br>
forward. Thereby, the protruding portion performs cutting or forms the groove with respect to the<br>
materials to be grounded such as concrete or stone.<br>
A base of the grinding diamond disc may be made of a material such as steel, resin, a<br>
composite material containing resin and reinforcement, or ceramic.<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, a diamond disc according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br><br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Hereinafter, a first embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, diamond grains 2 of a relatively large<br>
size for use with a diamond disc are bound in a limited range of the disc<br>
surface (grinding surface or grinding portion) 1A formed on one side<br>
surface of a circular base 1 formed of a steel plate. The diamond grains<br>
2 are of a size of #30 to #35. The diamond grains 2 are bound on the<br>
disc surface 1A to be fitted into brazing filler metal to a substantially half<br>
depth thereof.<br>
A mounting hole 3 is formed in a disc center region of the disc<br>
surface 1A to allow the disc 1 to be mounted to a disc grinder (not shown)<br>
which is a hand-held rotating device. The disc center region in which<br>
the mounting hole 3 is formed at the center is flat-plate shaped (flat) and<br>
is recessed backward (downward in Fig. 2) to have a predetermined depth,<br>
thereby forming a recessed portion 4. A region (outer peripheral region)<br>
located radially outward relative to the recessed portion 4 is rounded and<br>
protrudes forward in Fig. 2 in such a manner that the region of the disc<br>
surface 1A from an outer periphery 5 of the outer peripheral region<br>
toward the disc outer peripheral edge 6 forms a curved surface which is<br>
curved with a curvature which gradually increases toward the disc outer<br>
peripheral edge 6. The diamond grains 2 are bound on the region of the<br>
disc surface 1A which extends in a range from a location slightly radially<br>
inward of the outer periphery 5 to the disc outer peripheral edge 6 by the<br>
above mentioned method.<br><br>
As arrangement of the diamond grains 2 according to the<br>
embodiment, three adjacent rotational tracks a, b, and c among a<br>
number of rotational tracks which are formed in a radial direction, will be<br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the diamond grains 2 are positioned on the<br>
three adjacent rotational tracks a, b, and c which are formed in the radial<br>
direction as described below. A distance ml between forward and<br>
rearward diamond grains 2a which are adjacent in a rotational direction<br>
(see arrow R of Fig. 1) on the rotational track a (or rotational track b or c)<br>
is set longer than a distance m2 between the diamond 2a and diamond<br>
2b and 2c which are located on the rotational tracks b and c adjacent on<br>
both sides of the rotational track 2a.<br>
The diamond grains 2 are arranged regularly. In this<br>
embodiment, as seen in a local region, the diamond grains 2 are arranged<br>
in such a manner that the forward and rearward diamond grains 2 (2a)<br>
adjacent on each rotational track and the diamond grains 2 (2b and 2c)<br>
which are on rotational tracks adjacent on both sides thereof and are<br>
closest to the diamond grains 2a form a substantially diamond shape as<br>
seen in a front view. The diamond shape is continuously formed at<br>
plural positions to be spaced apart from one another. A plurality of gaps<br>
7 which are formed between the diamond grains 2 (2a and 2b or 2a and<br>
2c) which are located on adjacent rotational tracks and are located<br>
forward and rearward to be close to each other in a rotational direction<br>
extend in a swirl from slightly radially inward relative to the outer<br>
periphery 5 to the disc outer peripheral edge 6. The gaps 7 extending<br><br>
continuously are, as shown by gaps indicated by adjacent broken lines<br>
(imaginary reference lines) in Fig. 3, such that inner diameter ends 7a<br>
are located forward and outer diameter ends 7b are located backward in<br>
the rotational direction and extend obliquely and are curved to be<br>
rounded from the inner diameter ends 7a to the outer diameter ends 7b<br>
as seen in a front view. The gap 7 extends continuously in a swirl shape<br>
in such a manner that an outer diameter end portion of the gap 7<br>
deviates from an inner diameter end portion of the gap 7 by a<br>
predetermined angle α in the rotational direction (see Fig. 3,<br>
approximately 20 degrees in this embodiment). The predetermined<br>
angle α may alternatively be 20 degrees or larger.<br>
The grinding diamond disc of the present invention constructed<br>
as described above can be mounted to the rotating shaft of the<br>
commercially available disc grinder (not shown) or the like by the<br>
mounting hole 3 formed at the center region of the diamond disc, and the<br>
individual diamond grains perform grinding efficiently in grinding of the<br>
concrete or stone.<br>
Since the plurality of gaps 7 extend continuously from slightly<br>
radially inward from the outer periphery 5 of the disc surface 1A to the<br>
disc outer peripheral edge 6, the ground chips generated on the disc<br>
surface 1A are discharged smoothly from the gaps 7 toward the outer<br>
periphery of the disc and do not clog. As a result, the grinding diamond<br>
disc of the present invention exhibits stable grinding performance and<br>
increases grinding efficiency.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br><br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the second invention of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the diamond grains 2 are bound in a<br>
limited range on the disc surface (grinding surface or grinding portion)<br>
1A formed on one surface of the circular base 1 made of the steel plate.<br>
The mounting hole 3 is formed at the disc center region of the disc<br>
surface 1A to thereby allow the diamond disc to be mounted to a disc<br>
grinder (not shown). The disc center region having the mounting hole 3<br>
at the center thereof is flat-plate shaped (flat) and is entirely recessed<br>
backward (downward in Fig. 5) to have a predetermined depth to thereby<br>
form the recessed portion 4. The region (outer peripheral region) located<br>
radially outward relative to the recessed portion 4 is rounded and<br>
protrudes forward, and the region of the disc surface 1A from the outer<br>
periphery 5 to the disc outer peripheral edge 6 forms a curved surface<br>
which is curved backward with a curvature which gradually increases<br>
toward the disc outer peripheral edge 6. The diamond grains 2 are<br>
bound on the region of the disc surface 1A which extends in a range from<br>
a location slightly radially inward relative to the outer periphery 5 to the<br>
disc outer peripheral edge 5 by the above mentioned method.<br>
In the embodiment of the second invention, the diamond grains 2<br>
are bound on the disc surface 1A in such a manner that a plurality of<br>
diamond grains 2 are patterned in a predetermined configuration to form<br>
one diamond group unit A, and a plurality of diamond group units A are<br>
arranged. In this embodiment, the plurality of diamond grains 2 are<br>
patterned according to one pattern.<br><br>
The diamond group unit A of this embodiment forms a pattern in<br>
which three adjacent diamond grains 2 are located at apexes of an<br>
equilateral triangle.<br>
In this embodiment, as indicated by an imaginary reference line<br>
17 of Fig. 4, the diamond group units A are arranged on the disc surface<br>
1A along the swirl-shaped reference line 17 which swirls from an inner<br>
diameter side to an outer diameter side in an opposite direction to the<br>
rotational direction (see arrow R of Fig. 4) of the diamond disc. In<br>
addition, the gap between the diamond group units A (gap between<br>
adjacent diamond group units A which are located forward and rearward<br>
on the swirl reference line 17) gradually decreases as it is closer to the<br>
disc outer peripheral edge 6 to increase density of the diamond grains 2<br>
in the vicinity of the disc outer peripheral edge 6.<br>
In order to avoid unevenness of grinding, the diamond group units<br>
A arranged in swirl shape substantially partially overlap with each other<br>
on the rotational track in the radial direction. Also, the diamond group<br>
units A which are located forward and rearward on the swirl-shaped<br>
reference line 17 are oriented in opposite directions in the radial<br>
direction. The diamond group units A are not intended to be limited to<br>
arrangement in opposite directions, but may be oriented in the same<br>
direction, or otherwise, they may be oriented to be shifted by a<br>
predetermined angle, for example, 30 degrees.<br>
In accordance with the grinding diamond disc of the present<br>
invention constructed as described above, a plurality of diamond grains<br>
which are arranged effectively for grinding are patterned to form the<br><br>
diamond group units A which are arranged on the disc surface 1A,<br>
positioning of the diamond grains onto the disc surface 1A is achieved<br>
easily and quickly. As a result, the diamond disc can be easily obtained<br>
regardless of an increase in the number of diamond grains bound on the<br>
disc surface.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of a third invention will be described<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the diamond grains 2 are bound in a<br>
limited range on the disc surface 1A (grinding surface or grinding<br>
portion) formed on one surface of the circular base 1 made of the steel<br>
plate.<br>
The mounting hole 3 is formed at the disc center region of the disc<br>
surface 1A to thereby allow the diamond disc to be mounted to a disc<br>
grinder which is commercially available (not shown). The center region<br>
having the mounting hole 3 at the center thereof is flat-plate shaped (flat)<br>
and is entirely recessed backward (downward in Fig. 7) to have a<br>
predetermined depth to thereby form the recessed portion 4. The region<br>
(outer peripheral region) located radially outward relative to the recessed<br>
portion 4 is rounded to protrude forward, and the region from the outer<br>
periphery 5 to the disc outer peripheral edge 6 forms a curved surface<br>
which is curved backward with a curvature which gradually increases<br>
toward the disc outer peripheral edge 6.<br>
In the diamond disc of this embodiment, the region of the disc<br>
surface 1A to which the diamond grains 2 are bound is conceptually<br><br>
divided into a peripheral edge side region la and a center side region<br>
(region closer to the center) lb. The center side section lb which is<br>
contact with the outer periphery 5 of the recessed portion 4 is formed by<br>
a substantially flat surface (to be precise a surface having a large radius<br>
curvature) as seen in a side view, and the peripheral edge side region 1a<br>
extending from this to the outer peripheral edge 6 is formed by a round<br>
surface which is rounded to retreat backward (downward in Fig. 7)<br>
toward the outer peripheral edge 6. The substantially flat surface and<br>
the round surface are continuous.<br>
The diamond grains 2 are arranged on the peripheral edge side<br>
region 1a as described below, giving importance to the grinding function.<br>
A plurality of diamond grains 2 are bound on the peripheral edge side<br>
region la in a predetermined pattern (fixed pattern) to form a plurality of<br>
diamond group units A which are arranged regularly (in a swirl shape) on<br>
the disc surface 1A.<br>
In this embodiment, the diamond group unit A forms a pattern in<br>
which adjacent three diamond grains 2 are located on apexes of an<br>
equilateral triangle. The diamond grains 2 are, for example, temporarily<br>
bound on an adhesive sheet.<br>
The diamond group units A are arranged on the peripheral edge<br>
side region la along a swirl-shaped reference line which swirls in a<br>
direction from an inner diameter side to an outer diameter side in an<br>
opposite direction to the rotational direction (see arrow R of Fig. 6) of the<br>
diamond disc. In addition, the gap between the diamond group units A<br>
gradually decreases as it is closer to the disc outer peripheral edge 6 to<br><br>
increase density of the diamond grains 2.<br>
In order to avoid unevenness of grinding, the diamond group units<br>
A arranged in swirl shape substantially partially overlap with each other<br>
on the rotational track. Also, the diamond group units A which are<br>
arranged in the swirl shape and are located forward and rearward in<br>
such a manner that the diamond group units A are oriented in opposite<br>
directions in the radial direction.<br>
Meanwhile, the diamond grains 2 bound on the center side region<br>
lb are positioned considering an external appearance. The diamond<br>
grains 2 are arranged on the center side region lb to draw characters 27<br>
(or graphics) in a pointillist manner as seen in a front view, except for a<br>
part of the center side region lb (region closer to the center) in the radial<br>
direction, while the diamond units A are arranged in a part of the center<br>
side region lb (region closer to the center)) in which the characters 27 are<br>
not drawn, in the swirl shape as in the peripheral edge side region la.<br>
Since the diamond disc 1 is thus structured, the diamond grains 2<br>
bound on the peripheral edge side region la exhibit grinding<br>
performance as in those of the conventional diamond disc.<br>
The center side section lb including the region in which the<br>
characters 27 are drawn in the pointillist manner in the circumferential<br>
direction, and the peripheral edge side region la including the region in<br>
which the diamond group units A are functionally arranged, exist in a<br>
well-balanced manner. The diamond grains 2 are the same in the<br>
peripheral edge side region la and the center side region lb. But, the<br>
diamond grains 2 bound on the center side region lb are fewer than<br><br>
those bound on the peripheral edge side region 1a. This is because the<br>
diamond grains in the center side region 1b perform grinding in a lower<br>
degree and in an auxiliary manner in normal grinding.<br>
On the other hand, the diamond units A on the center side region<br>
lb has a density lower than those on the peripheral edge side portion la.<br>
For this reason, the characters (or graphics) 27 drawn in the pointillist<br>
manner are easily noticed.<br>
The grinding diamond disc 1 of the present invention thus<br>
constructed is preferable to a user, because it is not only useful in<br>
grinding but also a manufacture or a type thereof is capable of being<br>
recognized based on the characters or the graphics drawn in a pointillist<br>
manner. In addition, since the region in which the characters or the<br>
graphics are drawn is located at a region closer to an inner diameter<br>
which is less likely to wear with an elapse of time, they do not wear out<br>
and therefore can be recognized when the diamond disc itself is<br>
discarded. Furthermore, since the diamond grains are fewer in the<br>
region in which the characters or the graphics are drawn, wasteful<br>
consumption of resource is inhibited.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of a fourth invention will be<br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 8 through 10, the diamond grains 2 are bound<br>
in a limited range on the disc surface 1A which corresponds to one<br>
grinding portion formed on one surface of the circular base 1 made of the<br>
steel plate, and the disc outer peripheral edge 6 and an outer peripheral<br><br>
region of a back surface 8 which correspond to the other grinding<br>
function.<br>
In this embodiment, the mounting hole 3 is formed at the disc<br>
center region to thereby allow the diamond disc to be mounted to the disc<br>
grinder (not shown). The center region of the disc surface 1A having the<br>
mounting hole 3 at the center thereof is flat-plate shaped (flat) and is<br>
entirely recessed backward (downward in Fig. 9) to have a predetermined<br>
depth to thereby form the recessed portion 4. The region located<br>
radially outward relative to the recessed portion 4 is configured such that<br>
the region of the disc surface 1A which extends from the outer periphery<br>
5 of the recessed portion 4 to the disc outer peripheral edge 6 is flat-plate<br>
shaped (flat and ring-shaped).<br>
In the diamond disc of this embodiment, the region of the disc<br>
surface 1A to which the diamond grains 2 are bound is conceptually<br>
divided into the peripheral edge side region la and the center side region<br>
(region closer to the center) lb.<br>
The diamond grains 2 are arranged on the peripheral edge side<br>
region 1a, giving attention to grinding performance. Specifically, the<br>
diamond grains 2 are arranged on the peripheral edge side region 1a in<br>
such a manner that a plurality of adjacent diamond grains 2 are<br>
patterned in a predetermined (fixed) configuration to form diamond<br>
group units A which are arranged regularly (in a swirl shape) on the disc<br>
surface 1A. The diamond grains 2 are patterned by, for example, a<br>
method in which the diamond grains 2 are temporarily secured on the<br>
adhesive sheet.<br><br>
The diamond group unit A of this embodiment forms a pattern in<br>
which three adjacent diamond grains 2 are located at apexes of an<br>
equilateral triangle.<br>
The diamond grains 2 are patterned in the configuration by, for<br>
example, a method in which the diamond grains 2 are temporarily<br>
secured on a sheet.<br>
The diamond group units A are arranged on the peripheral edge<br>
side region la in such a manner that a gap between the diamond group<br>
units A gradually decreases as it is closer to the disc outer peripheral<br>
edge 6 to increase a density of the diamond grains 2 in the vicinity of the<br>
disc outer peripheral edge 6, and to provide a uniform density over the<br>
entire periphery.<br>
In order to avoid unevenness of grinding, the diamond group units<br>
A arranged in swirl shape to swirl from an inner peripheral side to an<br>
outer peripheral side in an opposite direction to the rotational direction<br>
(see arrow R of Fig. 8) of the diamond disc and are located forward and<br>
rearward substantially partially overlap with each other on the rotational<br>
track. Also, the diamond group units A which are located forward and<br>
rearward on the swirl-shaped line are oriented in opposite directions in<br>
the radial direction.<br>
The diamond grains 2 are continuously arranged in the form of<br>
the diamond group units A in a range from the peripheral edge portion la<br>
to the outer peripheral region of the back surface 8.<br>
Meanwhile, the diamond grains 2 are positioned on the center<br>
side region lb considering an external appearance. The plurality of<br><br>
diamond grains 2 are bound on the center side region lb to draw<br>
characters 27 (or graphics) in a pointillist manner as seen in the front<br>
view except for a part (region closer to the center in this embodiment) of<br>
the center side region lb in the radial direction, and the diamond group<br>
units A are arranged as in the peripheral edge side region 1a in a part of<br>
the center side region lb in which the characters 27 (region closer to the<br>
center) are not drawn.<br>
Since the diamond grains 2 are bound on the region ranging from<br>
the disc outer peripheral edge 6 to the outer peripheral region of the back<br>
surface 8 in the flat and ring-shaped disc surface 1A functions as one<br>
type of a rotating edge having a predetermined thickness. For this<br>
reason, if cutting in a limited sense is performed by cutting the disc outer<br>
peripheral edge 6 of the disc surface 1A into the surface to be ground,<br>
grinding a groove or cutting in a limited sense are easily performed. In<br>
normal cutting using only the disc surface 1A, the diamond disc of this<br>
embodiment exhibits grinding performance substantially as high as the<br>
conventional diamond disc.<br>
The center side region 1b including the region in which the<br>
characters 27 are drawn in a pointillist manner in the circumferential<br>
direction, and the peripheral edge side region 1a including the region in<br>
which the diamond group units A are functionally arranged, exist in a<br>
well-balanced manner. The diamond grains 2 are the same in the<br>
peripheral edge side region la and the center side region lb. But, the<br>
diamond grains 2 bound on the center side region lb are fewer than<br>
those bound on the peripheral edge side region la. This is because the<br><br>
center side region lb performs grinding in a lower degree and in an<br>
auxiliary manner in normal grinding.<br>
Meanwhile, the diamond units A on the center side region 1b has<br>
a density lower than those on the peripheral edge side portion la. For<br>
this reason, the characters (or graphics) 27 drawn in a pointillist manner<br>
are easily noticed.<br>
The grinding diamond disc of the present invention constructed<br>
as described above is not only useful in grinding but also functions as<br>
one type of a rotating cutting edge, thus improving generality of the<br>
grinding diamond disc. In addition, the diamond disc of the present<br>
invention is preferable to the user, since the manufacture or the type of<br>
the diamond disc is recognized by the characters or the graphics drawn<br>
in a pointillist manner. Further, the region in which the characters or<br>
the graphics are less likely to wear with an elapse of time, and therefore<br>
can be recognized when the diamond disc itself is discarded.<br>
Furthermore, since the diamond grains are fewer in the region in which<br>
the characters or the graphics are drawn, wasteful resource<br>
consumption is inhibited.<br>
As an alternative to the above mentioned embodiments, as shown<br>
in Figs. 11 and 12, an outer edge region of the base 1 of the diamond disc<br>
may be flat and an extending portion 1D may be formed in the outer edge<br>
region to be rounded and to protrude only backward. And, the diamond<br>
grains 2 may be arranged on the outer peripheral region of the base 1<br>
including the extending portion 1D. The diamond grains 2 may be<br>
arranged to the extending portion 1D continuously or intermittently as<br><br>
shown in Fig. 11. With such a structure, the diamond disc is capable of<br>
performing cutting as well as grinding. In Fig. 11, an arrow R indicates<br>
the rotational direction of the diamond disc.<br>
As a another alternative, as shown in Figs. 13 and 14, the<br>
diamond grains 2 may be omitted in the disc surface 1A and an extending<br>
portion 1D protruding forward and backward may be formed. Such a<br>
diamond disc is configured exclusively for cutting in a limited sense or<br>
groove forming.<br>
As a further alternative, as shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the diamond<br>
disc configured exclusively for cutting in a limited sense or groove<br>
forming may be constructed such that the base 1 is entirely formed by a<br>
flat circular plate. In Figs. 13 and 15, an arrow R represents the<br>
rotational direction of the diamond disc.<br>
In Figs. 11 through 16, the same reference numerals as those in<br>
Figs. 1 through 10 denote the same or corresponding parts.<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
