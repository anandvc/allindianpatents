The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell component, especially for use at high<br>
temperatures and in corrosive environments. The fuel cell component consists of a<br>
metallic substrate, such as stainless steel, and a coating, which in turn comprises at least<br>
one metallic layer and one reactive layer. The fuel cell component is produced by<br>
depositing the different layers and thereafter oxidising the coating to accomplish a<br>
conductive surface layer comprising at least one complex metal oxide such as a perovskite<br>
and/or a spinel.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
One example of a fuel cell component, which is used at high temperatures and in a<br>
corrosive environment, is an interconnect for fuel cells, especially for Solid Oxide Fuel<br>
Cells (SOFC). The interconnect material used in fuel cells should work as both separator<br>
plate between the fuel side and the oxygen/air side, and current collector of the fuel cell.<br>
For an interconnect material to be a good separator plate the material has to be dense to<br>
avoid gas diffusion through the material and in order to be a good current collector the<br>
interconnect material has to be electrically conducting and should not form insulating<br>
oxide scales on its surfaces.<br>
Interconnects can be made of for example graphite, ceramics or metals, often stainless<br>
steel. For instance, ferritic chromium steels are used as interconnect material in SOFC,<br>
which the two following articles are examples of: "Evaluation of Ferrite Stainless Steels as<br>
Interconnects in SOFC Stacks" by P.B. Friehling and S. Linderoth in the Proceedings Fifth<br>
European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum, Lucerne, Switzerland, edited by J. Huijsmans<br>
(2002) p. 855; "Development of Ferritic Fe-Cr Alloy for SOFC separator" by T. Uehara,<br>
T. Ohno &amp; A. Toji in the Proceedings Fifth European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum,<br>
Lucerne, Switzerland, edited by J. Huijsmans (2002) p. 281.<br>
In a SOFC application the thermal expansion of the interconnect material must not deviate<br>
greatly from the thermal expansion of the electro-active ceramic materials used as anode,<br>
electrolyte and cathode in the fuel cell stack. Ferritic chromium steels are highly suitable<br><br>
materials for this application, since the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of ferritic<br>
steels are close to the TECs of the electro-active ceramic materials used in the fuel cell.<br>
An interconnect in a fuel cell will be exposed to oxidation during operation. Especially in<br>
the case of SOFC, this oxidation may be detrimental for the fuel cell efficiency and the<br>
lifetime of the fuel cell. For example, the oxide scale formed on the surface of the<br>
interconnect material may grow thick and may even flake off or crack due to thermal<br>
cycling. Therefore, the oxide scale should have a good adhesion to the interconnect<br>
material. Furthermore, the formed oxide scale should also have good electrical<br>
conductivity and not grow too thick, since thicker oxide scales will lead to an increased<br>
internal resistance. The formed oxide scale should also be chemically resistant to the gases<br>
used as fuels in a SOFC, i.e., no volatile metal-containing species such as chromium<br>
oxyhydroxides should be formed. Volatile compounds such as chromium oxyhydroxide<br>
will contaminate the electro-active ceramic materials in a SOFC stack, which in turn will<br>
lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the fuel cell. Furthermore, in the case the<br>
interconnect is made out of stainless steel, there is a risk for chromium depletion of the<br>
steel during the lifetime of the fuel cell due to diffusion of chromium from the centre of<br>
the steel to the formed chromium oxide scale at the surface.<br>
One disadvantage with the use of commercial ferritic chromium steel as interconnect in<br>
SOFC is that they usually are alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and/or silicon,<br>
which will form Al2O3 and SiO2, respectively, at the working temperature of the SOFC.<br>
These oxides are insulating, thereby leading to an increase of electrical resistance of the<br>
cell, and as a consequence thereof decreasing the efficiency of the fuel cell.<br>
One solution to the problems that arise when using ferritic steels as interconnect material<br>
for SOFC is the use of ferritic steels with very low amounts of Si and Al in order to avoid<br>
the formation of insulating oxide layers. These steels are usually also alloyed with<br>
manganese and rare earth metals such as La. This has for instance been done in patent<br>
application US 2003/0059335, where the steel is alloyed (by weight) with Mn 0.2 - 1.0%,<br>
La 0.01 - 0.4%, Al less than 0.2% and Si less than 0.2%. Another example is in patent<br>
application EP 1 298 228 A2 where the steel is alloyed (by weight) with Mn less 1.0%, Si<br><br>
less 1.0%, Al less 1.0%, along with Y less 0.5%, and/or rare earth metals (REM) less<br>
0.2%.<br>
In patent application US 6 054231 a super alloy, defined as an austenitic stainless steel, an<br>
alloy of nickel and chromium, a nickel based alloy or a cobalt based alloy, is first coated<br>
with either Mn, Mg or Zn and then with a thick layer, 25 to 125 µm of an additional metal<br>
from the group Cu, Fe, Ni, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Ir or Rh. The coating of a thick second layer of<br>
an expensive metal such as Ni, Ag or Au is not a cost productive way of protecting already<br>
relatively expensive base materials such as super alloys.<br>
US2004/0058205 describes metal alloys, used as electrical contacts, which when oxidised<br>
forms a highly conductive surface. These alloys can be applied onto a substrate, such as<br>
steel. The conducting surface is accomplished by doping of one metal, such as Ti, with<br>
another metal, such as Nb or Ta. Furthermore, the alloys according to US2004/0058205<br>
are applied onto the surface in one step and thereafter oxidised.<br>
Moreover, a bipolar plate is disclosed in DE 195 47 699 Al having a part of the surface<br>
coated with metal or metal oxide which forms a mixed oxide layer of high conductivity<br>
with Cr from the substrate. The invention in DE 195 47 699 Al also relates to a plate<br>
consisting of a chromium oxide forming alloy with cobalt, nickel or iron enrichment layers<br>
in the region of the electrode contact surface. Furthermore, in DE 103 06 649 Al is<br>
disclosed a Cr-oxide forming substrate, to be used as interconnect in a SOFC, having a<br>
layer comprising an element which may form a spinel.<br>
None of the cited prior art provides a satisfactory fuel cell component material for use in<br>
corrosive environments and/or at high temperatures which is produced in a cost-effective<br>
manner and with a high possibility of controlling the quality of the conductive surface.<br>
Therefore, it is a primary object to provide a fuel cell component material with a low<br>
surface resistance and high corrosion resistance.<br>
Another object is to provide a fuel cell component material, which will maintain its<br>
properties during operation for long service lives.<br><br><br>
A further object is to provide fuel cell component material that has a good mechanical<br>
strength even at high temperatures.<br>
Another object is to provide a cost-effective material for fuel cell components.<br>
Summary<br>
A strip substrate of a metallic material, preferably stainless steel, more preferably a ferritic<br>
chromium steel, is provided with a coating comprising at least one layer of a metallic<br>
material and at least one reactive layer. In this context a reactive layer is considered to<br>
mean a layer, which consists of at least one element or compound which forms at least one<br>
complex metal oxide, such as a spinel and/or a perovskite, with the metallic material of the<br>
first layer when oxidised.<br>
The strip substrate may be provided with a coating by any method resulting in a dense and<br>
adherent coating. One preferred example of a coating method is vapour deposition, such as<br>
PVD, in a continuous roll-to-roll process. Thereafter, fuel cell components are formed of<br>
the coated strip by any conventional forming method, such as punching, stamping or the<br>
like. The fuel cell component, consisting of a coated strip, may be oxidised before<br>
assembling the fuel cell or fuel cell stack, or may be oxidised during operation.<br>

Detailed description<br>
In the present disclosure the words "providing" and "provided" are to be considered<br>
meaning an intentional act and the result of an intentional act, respectively. Consequently,<br>
in this context a surface provided with a layer is intended to be a result of an active action.<br><br>
It has now been discovered that a complex metal oxide structure can be formed on the<br>
surface instead of a "traditional" oxide on metal substrates used as fuel cell components.<br>
The purpose of the complex oxide is to accomplish a surface with high electrical<br>
conductivity in order to have a surface with a low contact resistance.<br>
In this context a complex metal oxide is any metal oxide consisting of, but not limited to,<br>
include at least two different metal ions in the structure. Examples of such oxide structures<br>
are spinel and perovskite type structures.<br>
A coated strip material is produced by providing a metallic substrate, such as stainless<br>
steel, preferably a ferritic chromium steel with a chromium content of 15-30 % by weight.<br>
The strip material substrate is thereafter provided with a coating consisting of at least two<br>
separate layers. One layer is a metallic layer based on a metal or metal alloy selected from<br>
the group consisting of Al, Cr, Co, Mo, Ni, Ta, W, Zr or an alloy based on any one of<br>
these elements, preferably Cr, Co, Mo or alloys based on any one of these elements. In this<br>
context "based on" means that the element/alloy constitutes the main component of the<br>
composition, preferably constitutes at least 50 % by weight of the composition. The other<br>
layer is a reactive layer consisting of at least one element or compound, which forms a<br>
complex metal oxide structure with the element/elements of the metallic layer when<br>
oxidised. The precise composition of the coating can be tailor-made to achieve the<br>
formation of the wanted complex metal oxide structure which could be a spinel, perovskite<br>
and/or any other ternary or quartery metal oxide upon oxidisation with the desired<br>
properties, for example good conductivity and good corrosion resistance.<br>
One reason for providing the surface with a coating comprising two separate layers, one<br>
being the metallic layer and the other being the reactive layer, is that a much more<br>
simplified production of the fuel cell component is accomplished. However, the main<br>
reason for by providing a coating with two separate layers is that it is easier to control the<br>
amount of the different elements in the mixed oxide, i.e. tailor make the desired<br>
composition in order to achieve the desired result. Furthermore, an excellent adhesion of<br>
the coating to the substrate can be accomplished, thereby improving the properties of fuel<br><br><br>
cell component and improving the efficiency and prolonging life time of the fuel cell and<br>
the fuel cell stack.<br>
The reactive layer may be located on either side of the layer of a metallic material; i.e.<br>
sandwiched between the substrate and the metallic layer or, on top of the first deposited<br>
metallic layer.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, the metallic material consists of essentially pure<br>
Cr or a Cr-based alloy. In this case, when the coating is oxidised a compound with a<br>
formula of MCrO3 and/or MCr2O4 is formed, wherein M is any of the previously<br>
mentioned elements/compounds from the reactive layer. The reactive layer may contain<br>
elements from Group 2A or 3A of the periodic system, REM or transition metals. In this<br>
embodiment the element M of the reactive layer preferably consists of any of the<br>
following elements: La, Y, Ce, Bi, Sr, Ba, Ca, Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Fe or mixtures thereof,<br>
more preferably La, Y, Sr, Mn, Co and or mixtures thereof. One specific example of this<br>
embodiment is one layer of Cr and the other layer being Co.<br>
The reactive layer is obtained by preoxidation of the surface of the metallic base material<br>
according to another preferred embodiment. In the case the metallic base material is a<br>
stainless steel, a chromium oxide will be formed. Thereafter a layer of Ni or Co is<br>
deposited on the formed oxide according to this preferred embodiment.<br>
The coating may also comprise further layers. For example, the coating may comprise a<br>
first metallic layer, thereafter a reactive layer and finally another metallic layer. This<br>
embodiment will further ensure a good conductivity of the surface of the fuel cell<br>
component. However, due to economical reasons the coating does not comprise more than<br>
separate 10 layers, preferably not more than 5 separate layers.<br>
The thickness of the different layers are usually less than 20 µm, preferably less than 10<br>
urn, more preferably less than 5 µm, most preferably less than 1 µm. According to one<br>
embodiment the thickness of the reactive layer is less than that of the metallic layer. This<br>
is especially important when the reactive layer comprises elements or compounds that<br>
upon oxidation themselves form non-conducting oxides. In this case it is important that<br><br>
essentially the whole reactive layer/layers are allowed to react and/or diffuse into the<br>
metallic layer at least during operation of the fuel cell, so that the conductivity of the<br>
component during operation is not affected negatively.<br>
The coated strip may be produced in a batch like process. However, for economical<br>
reasons, the strip may be produced-in a continuous roll-to-roll process. The coating may be<br>
provided onto the substrate by coating with the metallic layer and the reactive layer.<br>
However, according to an alternative embodiment of the invention the coating may also be<br>
provided by pre-oxidation of the substrate to an oxide thickness of at least 50 nm and<br>
thereafter coating with the additional layer. The coating is thereafter oxidised further as to<br>
achieve the complex metal oxide structure. This alternative embodiment of providing the<br>
coating onto the base material is especially applicable when the base material is a ferritic<br>
chromium steel, such as the oxide formed on the surface is a chromium based oxide.<br>
The coating may be performed with any coating process that generates a thin dense<br>
coating with good adhesion to the underlying material, i.e. the substrate or an underlying<br>
coating layer. Naturally, the surface of the strip has to be cleaned in a proper way before<br>
coating, for example to remove oil residues and/or the native oxide layer of the substrate.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, the coating is performed by the usage of PVD<br>
technique in a continuous roll-to-roll process, preferably electron beam evaporation which<br>
might be reactive of plasma activated if needed.<br>
Furthermore, the strip may be provided with a coating on one side or on both sides. In the<br>
case the coating is provided on both surfaces of the strip, the composition of the different<br>
layers on each side of the strip may be the same but may also differ. The strip may be<br>
coated on both sides simultaneously or one side at a time.<br>
Optionally, the coated strip is exposed to an intermediate homogenisation step as to mix<br>
the separate layers and accomplish a homogenous coating. The homogenisation can be<br>
achieved by any conventional heat treatment under appropriate atmosphere, which could<br>
be vacuum or a reducing atmosphere, such as hydrogen or mixtures of hydrogen gas and<br>
inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon or helium.<br><br>
The coated strip is thereafter oxidised at a temperature above room temperature, preferably<br>
above 100°C, more preferably above 300°C, so that a complex metal oxide is formed on<br>
the surface of the strip. Naturally, the coating thickness will increase when the coating is<br>
oxidised due to the complex metal oxide formation. The oxidation may result in a total<br>
oxidation of the coating or a partially oxidation of the coating, depending on for example<br>
the thickness of the layers, if the coating is homogenised, and time and temperature of the<br>
oxidation. In either case, the different layers of the coating are allowed to at least partially<br>
react and/or diffuse into each other, if this is not done by an intermediate homogenisation<br>
step. The oxidation may be performed directly after coating, i.e. before the formation of<br>
the fuel cell component final shape, after formation to the shape of the final component,<br>
i.e. the manufacturing of the fuel cell component from the coated strip, or after the fuel<br>
cell or fuel cell assembly, has been assembled, i.e. during operation.<br>
The purpose of accomplishing a complex metal oxide structure on the surface of the strip<br>
is that the formed structure has a much lower electrical resistance compared to traditional<br>
oxides of the elements of the metallic layer. This will in turn lead to a lower contact<br>
resistance of the fuel cell component and therefore also a better efficiency of fuel cell. For<br>
example, the resistivity of Cr2O3 at 800°C is about 7800 Ω•cm while the resistivity of for<br>
example La0.85Sr0.15CrO3 is several orders of magnitude lower, namely about 0,01 Ω•cm.<br>
Also, in the case of complex chromium containing ternary oxides such as spinel and<br>
perovskites it is believe that these oxides are much less volatile than pure Cr2O3 at high<br>
temperatures.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a complex metal oxide structure, such as perovskite and/or<br><br>
spinel, on the surface of a substrate such as stainless steel the fuel cell component will<br>
have good mechanical strength and is less expensive to manufacture than for example fuel<br>
cell components made entirely from a complex metal oxide material.<br>
Also, in the case where the substrate is a stainless steel the chromium depletion of the<br>
substrate is inhibited since the metallic layer will oxidise long before chromium of the<br>
substrate, this is especially pronounced when the metallic layer is Cr or a Cr-based alloy.<br>
Therefore, the corrosion resistance of the substrate will not be reduced during operation.<br><br>
As an alternative to the above-described invention, one might apply the coating by other<br>
processes, for example co-evaporation of the different components of the coating.<br>
Examples of the invention will now be described. These should not be seen as limiting of<br>
the invention but merely of illustrative nature.<br>
Example 1<br>
A stainless steel substrate is coated with a coating consisting of a metallic layer and a<br>
reactive layer. The metallic layer is a Cr or a Cr-based alloy. The reactive layer in this case<br>
includes transition metals, such as Ni, Co, Mn and/or Fe, if the oxide should receive a<br>
spinel structure. If a perovskite structure is desired, the reactive layer contains elements<br>
from Group 2A or 3A of the periodic system, or REM. Preferably, the reactive layer<br>
contains Ba, Sr, Ca, Y, La and/or Ce. If a mixed structure including both a spinel and a<br>
perovskite structure, the reactive layer may contain elements from Group 2A or 3 A of the<br>
periodic system, or REM along with transition metals. Alternatively, Mn and/or REM are<br>
allowed to diffuse from the substrate.<br>
The coating is optionally homogenised and thereafter oxidised so as to form the desired<br>
structure on the surface. This results in a very low surface resistance of the strip substrate.<br>
Also, the Cr-oxides MCrO3 and/or MCr2O4 formed during oxidation are less volatile than<br>
pure Cr2O3 at high temperatures. This results in a coated strip that is highly suitable to be<br>
used as interconnects in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.<br>
Example 2<br>
A 0.2 mm thick strip substrate of a ferritic chromium stainless steel was coated. The<br>
coating was homogenised so as to achieve a CrM layer wherein M is a mixture of La and<br>
Mn. The concentration of Cr in the coating is approximately 35-55 wt%, while the<br>
concentration of Mn is approximately 30-60 wt% and the concentration of La is 3-4 wt%.<br><br><br>
The surface was analysed by Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES).<br>
Using this technique, it is possible to study the chemical composition of the surface layer<br>
as a function of the distance from the surface. The method is very sensitive for small<br>
differences in concentration and has a depth resolution of a few nanometres. The result of<br>
the GDOES analysis of a 1.5 µm thick CrM surface alloying layer is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Two samples of a ferritic chromium steel with the nominal composition, by weight max<br>
0.050 % C; max 0.25 % Si; max 0.35 % Mn; 21-23% Cr; max 0,40 % Ni; 0.80-1.2 % Mo;<br>
max 0.01 % Al; 0.60 - 0.90% Nb; small additions of V, Ti and Zr and natural occurring<br>
impurities were manufactured. One of the samples was coated with a 0.1 Dm thick cobalt<br>
layer and a 0.3 Dm thick chromium layer. The samples were oxidised in air at 850 °C for<br>
168 hours prior to the analysis. The samples were analysed by Grazing Incidence X-Ray<br>
Diffraction (GIXRD) with an incidence angel of 0.5 °, see figure 2. It should be pointed<br>
out that GIXRD is a surface sensitive diffraction method and only the crystalline phase of<br>
the top layer on the oxidised steel is analysed. Any crystalline phase present under the top<br>
layer which is not reached by the grazing X-rays will not be seen in the diffractogram. The<br>
amount of spinel vs. chromium oxide formed in the top layer of the oxide scale of each<br>
sample were compared by measuring the peak to bottom intensity of the Cr2O3 (Eskolaite)<br>
reflection at 2 theta = 36.7 ° (3) and diving it by the intensity of the spinel reflection at 2<br>
theta « 45 ° (4). The ratio of Eskolaite /spinel for the uncoated oxidised samples was 9.9<br>
while for the coated sample the ratio was 1.0. This could be interpreted as a ten-fold<br>
increase of spinel structure in the surface oxide scale formed. In figure 2 the (1)<br>
diffractogram is the uncoated sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C and the (2)<br>
diffractogram is the coated sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C.<br>
Example 4<br>
Three samples of a ferritic chromium steel with the nominal composition, by weight max<br>
0.050 % C; max 0.25 % Si; max .35 % Mn; 21-23% Cr; max 0,40 % Ni; 0.80-1.2 % Mo;<br>
max 0.01 % Al; 0.60 - 0.90 % Nb; small addition of V, Ti and Zr and normally occurring<br>
impurities were manufactured. Two of the samples were pre-oxidised in air to get a 100<br><br><br>
nm thick oxide scale. The pre-oxidised samples were thereafter coated with a metallic<br>
layer. The metallic layer on sample 2 was a 300 nm thick Ni layer and on sample 3 a 300<br>
nm thick Co layer. All three samples were then further oxidised in air at 850 °C for 168<br>
hours prior to the analysis. The samples were analysed by Grazing Incidence X-Ray<br>
Diffraction (GIXRD) with an incidence angel of 0.5 °, see figure 3. It should be pointed<br>
out that GIXRD is a surface sensitive diffraction method and only the crystalline phase of<br>
the top layer on the oxidised steel is analysed. Any crystalline phase present under the top<br>
layer which is not reached by the grazing X-rays will not be seen in the diffractogram. The<br>
amount of spinel vs. chromium oxide formed in the top layer of the oxide scale of each<br>
sample were compared by measuring the peak to bottom intensity of the Cr2O3 (Eskolaite)<br>
reflection at 2 theta = 36.7 ° (4) and diving it by the intensity of the spinel MCr2O4<br>
reflection at 2 theta =45° (5). The ratio of Cr2O3 /MCr2O4 for the uncoated oxidised<br>
samples was 9.9 while for the pre-oxidised sample with the Ni layer the ratio was 1.26 and<br>
for the pre-oxidised sample with the Co layer the ratio was 0.98. This indicating an 8.5,<br>
respective 10 folded increase of spinel structure in the formed oxide scale. Interesting to<br>
note here is that the nickel layer does not only form more spinel oxide in the scale but also<br>
NiO is formed when the sample has been oxidised (6). In figure 3 the (1) diffractogram is<br>
the uncoated sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C, the (2) diffractogram is the<br>
pre-oxidised sample with a Ni layer sample oxidised in air for 168 hours at 850 °C and the<br>
(3) diffractogram is the pre-oxidised sample with a Co layer sample oxidised in air for 168<br>
hours at 850°C.<br><br>
