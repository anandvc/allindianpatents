				<td>FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to applying a chemical treatment to fibers which are<br>
suitable for processing into a composite. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
applying a chemical treatment to fibers where the chemical treatment has a low viscosity<br>
and is substantially free of an unreactable solvent Even more particularly, the invention<br>
relates to using heat energy to lower the viscosity and improve the wetting ability of a<br>
chemical treatment after being applied to the fibers and/or to increase the molecular weight<br>
of or cure the applied chemical treatment with very little, if any, generation of volatile<br>
organic carbon (VOC).<br>
The present invention also generally relates to the manufacture of fiber-<br>
reinforced composite articles, in particular, to wire-coated fiber/polymer composite strands<br>
used in molding fiber-reinforced composite articles. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to thermoplastic encased fiber/polymer composite threads and pellets moldable into<br>
fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composite articles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fibers or fibrous materials are often used as reinforcements in composite<br>
materials. Glass and other ceramic fibers are commonly manufactured by supplying the<br>
ceramic in molten form to a bushing, drawing fibers from the bushing, applying a chemical<br>
treatment, such as a size, to the drawn ceramic fibers and then gathering the sized fibers<br>
into a tow or strand. There are basically three known general types of chemical treatraents-<br>
-solvent-based systems, melt-based systems and radiation cure-based systems.<br>
In a broad sense, the solvent-based chemical treatments include organic<br>
materials that are in aqueous solutions (i.e., dissolved, suspended, or otherwise dispersed in<br>
water), as well as those that are dissolved in organic solvents. U.S. Patents Nos. 5,055,119,<br>
5,034,276 and 3,473,950 disclose examples of such chemical treatments. The solvent (i.e.,<br>
water, organic solvent, or other suitable solvent) is used to lower the viscosity of the<br>
chemical treatment to facilitate wetting of the glass fibers. The solvent is substantially<br>
unreactable with the other constituents of the chemical treatment and is driven out of the<br><br>
cnemical treatment after the wetting of the glass fibers. In each process for applying<br>
solvent-based chemical treatments, an external source of heat or some other device external<br>
to the fibers is used to evaporate or otherwise remove the water or other solvent from the<br>
applied chemical treatment, leaving a coating of organic material on the glass fibers. One<br>
drawback to a solvent-based process is mat the added step of removing the solvent<br>
increases production costs. In addition, some organic solvents ate very flammable in vapor<br>
form and pose a fire hazard. Another problem with solvent-based systems is that it is very<br>
difficult, if not impossible, to remove all of the solvent from the applied chemical<br>
treatment Therefore, solvent-based chemical treatments are limited, as a practical matter,<br>
to those systems where any residual solvent left behind in the coating of organic material<br>
remaining on the fibers will not have a significantly adverse affect.<br>
With prior melt-based chemical treatments, thermoplastic-type organic<br>
solids are melted and applied to the glass fibers. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,567,102,4,537,610,<br>
3,783,001 and 3,473,950 disclose examples of such chemical treatments. One disadvantage<br>
of prior melt-based processes is the energy costs associated with melting the chemical<br>
treatments. The organic solids used with prior melt-based systems are melted at relatively<br>
high temperatures in order for the melted organic solids to be applied to the glass fibers.<br>
The high temperatures are needed because the organic solids used in the past have relatively<br>
high molecular weights. Such high melt temperatures also pose the risk to workers of being<br>
burned by the equipment used to melt the plastic material and by the molten plastic material<br>
itself. In addition, specialized equipment is typically needed to apply and otherwise handle<br>
the high-temperature molten plastic material.<br>
The radiation cure-based chemical treatments are typically acrylate-based<br>
organic chemicals, either with or without a solvent, which are cured with ultraviolet<br>
radiation via a photoinitiator. U.S. Patents Nos. 5,171,634 and 5,011,523 disclose<br>
examples of such chemical treatments. A major disadvantage to processes using such<br>
chemical treatments is that the radiation used, such as ultraviolet radiation, and the<br>
chemical treatment used, such as acrylates, are relatively hazardous, often requiring special<br>
handling and safety precautions. Some of these processes, such as that disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,171,634, require the radiation curing to be repeated a number of times to<br>
obtain the maximum benefit. Each additional radiation-curing step increases the risks<br>
involved and adds additional cost to the process. Furthermore, radiation-curable thcrmoset<br><br>
plastics, and their requisite photoinitiators, represent a highly specialized area of thermoset<br>
chemistry. As a consequence, such radiation-cured chemical treatments are expensive and<br>
not generally compatible with various classes of matrix resins.<br>
In order to fabricate composite parts, the strands of glass fibers are often<br>
further chemically treated in an off-line impregnation process with a polymeric resin. The<br>
resin can be a thermoset, either one- or two-part, or a thermoplastic. In one example,<br>
previously formed and sized continuous glass fibers are impregnated with a thermosetting<br>
resin and then pulled through a heated pultrusion die to cure the resin and make the<br>
composite article, such as ladder rails. In such an off-line process, the continuous glass<br>
fibers must be separated in some manner to allow impregnation of the resin between the<br>
fibers and then recombined. This requirement almost always results in the use of additional<br>
hardware such as spreader bars, impregnation baths, and drying or curing ovens. These<br>
types of processes have the disadvantage that they add cost and complexity to the process.<br>
In addition, the resultant extra handling of the glass fibers can cause breakage of the<br>
individual glass filaments, and thereby a degradation in the properties of the composite<br>
article. Therefore, while such off-line processes may be effective, they are time-consuming<br>
and inefficient (e.g., requiring additional process steps) and, thus, expensive.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a safer, more efficient and more<br>
cost-effective process for applying a chemical treatment to glass fibers, where the viscosity<br>
of the chemical treatment is low enough to sufficiently wet the glass fibers without the need<br>
for a solvent, where the chemical treatment does not require radiation curing and the<br>
viscosity of the applied chemical treatment increases with very little, if any, generation of<br>
water, volatile organic carbon (VOC) or other solvent vapor, and where the resulting<br>
chemically treated glass fibers are. suitable for subsequent processing into a composite<br>
article. There is also a need for an in-line process for forming a preimpregnated glass<br>
composite strand from a plurality of continuously formed glass fibers which are chemically<br>
treated in this manner, where the resulting prepreg strand is suitable for subsequent in-line<br>
or off-line processing into a composite article.<br>
The use of composites having fiber-reinforced polymeric matrices is<br>
widespread. Fiber-reinforced polymeric composite products have been manufactured using<br>
a variety of processes and materials. As referred to above, one such process involves<br>
impregnating one or more strands or bundles of reinforcing fibers (e.g., glass fibers,<br><br>
synthetic fibers or some other reinforcing fibers) with a thermoplastic material, and using<br>
the resulting composite strands to mold a composite article. These composite strands have<br>
been used in the form of continuous threads (i.e., long lengths of strand) and discrete pellets<br>
(i.e.; short lengths of strand). The fibers from the composite strands provide the<br>
reinforcement and the thermoplastic material forms at least part of the matrix for the<br>
composite article.<br>
It is desirable for each fiber strand to be fully impregnated with the<br>
thermoplastic matrix material, that is, for the thermoplastic material essentially to be evenly<br>
distributed throughout each bundle of fibers and between the fibers. Because all of the<br>
fibers start out surrounded by matrix material, the fully impregnated fiber strands can be<br>
molded less expensively and more efficiently and the corresponding composite article can<br>
exhibit improved properties. However, it is difficult and time-consuming to fully<br>
impregnate fiber strands with typical thermoplastic matrix materials (e.g., engineering<br>
thermoplastics). Fully impregnating strands at high throughput rates has been particularly<br>
difficult, especially at the throughput rates typically experienced during the production of<br>
continuously formed glass reinforcing fibers.<br>
In an effort to fully impregnate continuously formed glass fiber strands, the<br>
number of fibers used to form each strand (i.e., fiber density) has been reduced from a<br>
typical density of about 2000 fibers/strand to 1200 fibers/strand or less, to reduce the time it<br>
takes to impregnate each fiber strand. However, by reducing the number of fibers in each<br>
strand being processed at a given time, the production output and cost efficiency of the<br>
process can be adversely impacted. In addition, fully impregnating even such lower density<br>
strands is still sufficiently time-consuming to prevent even the lower density strands from<br>
being fully impregnated and processed at the higher throughput rates typically approached<br>
in the production of continuous glass reinforcing fibers.<br>
In an effort to obtain higher throughputs, one prior process only partially<br>
impregnates the fiber strand and coats the strand in a uniform layer of thermoplastic matrix<br>
material, leaving a central core of fibers not impregnated with the thermoplastic. This<br>
coating and partial impregnation of the strand is accomplished by pulling the strand through<br>
what has been referred to as a "wire-coating" device. Wire-coating devices, such as that<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,451,355, typically include an extruder for supplying molten<br>
thermoplastic matrix material and a die having an entrance orifice, an exit orifice and a<br><br>
coating chamber disposed therebetween. The extruder supplies molten thermoplastic<br>
material to the coating chamber. The strand is coated and partially impregnated with the<br>
thermoplastic matrix material as it passes through the coating chamber, and the coating is<br>
formed into a uniform layer when the coated strand passes through the exit orifice of the<br>
die. The resulting coated strand is either used in the form of a thread (e.g., in compression-<br>
molding applications) or cut into discrete pellets (e.g., in injection-molding applications).<br>
Because the strand is only partially impregnated with the thermoplastic matrix material, the<br>
strand can be processed at relatively high throughputs.<br>
However, these partially impregnated wire-coated strands also exhibit a<br>
number of problems because of their central core of unimpregnated fibers. When in pellet<br>
form, the fibers in the central unimpregnated core tend to fall out of the thermoplastic<br>
coating. When the strand is in the form of a thread, the core fibers are less likely to fall out,<br>
but the core of these wire-coated threads must still be impregnated at some point to<br>
optimize the properties of the resulting composite article. Impregnating the central core of<br>
such wire-coated threads during the molding operation can be difficult and time-consuming,<br>
if not impossible as a practical matter. Thus, molding with such wire-coated threads can<br>
cause a reduction in the overall production rates, rather than an increase as desired.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a way to produce fully impregnated fiber<br>
strands at throushput rates, even when each strand has a relatively high fiber density,<br>
where the resulting composite strands, either in thread or pellet form, are suitable for<br>
molding fiber-reinforced thermoplastic articles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND<br>
SOVENT-FREE-CHEMICAL TREATMENTS<br>
One general aspect of the invention relates to essentially solvent-free<br>
chemical treatments for applying to fibers to be processed into composite articles. One or<br>
more-chemical treatments can be applied to the fibers, such as with one or more<br>
conventional applicators, so as to size and/or preimpregnate a sufficient number of the<br>
reinforcing fibers to obtain the composite properties desired.<br>
More particularly, fibers or filaments are sized and/or preimpregnated with a<br>
chemical treatment The chemical treatment has a low viscosity, is substantially free of an<br>
unreactable solvent, and is not cured by actinic radiation. The low viscosity may be<br>
obtained by choosing relatively low molecular weight constituents for the chemical<br>
treatment<br>
Heat energy may be used to lower the viscosity and improve the wetting<br>
ability of the chemical treatment after the treatment is applied to the fibers. Additionally or<br>
alternatively, heat energy may be used to increase the molecular weight of, or otherwise<br>
cure (i.e., crosslink or otherwise increase the molecular weight of), the applied chemical<br>
treatment Alternatively, no heat energy may be supplied to the applied chemical treatment<br>
Regardless of whether heating is employed, there is little, if any, generation of water vapor,<br>
volatile organic carbon (VOC) vapor, or other solvent vapor.<br>
The resulting chemically treated fibers are suitable for forming a composite<br>
strand, e.g., a preimpregnated strand ("prepreg"). The composite strand may be<br>
subsequently processed in-line or off-line into a composite article having reinforcing fibers<br>
disposed in a polymeric matrix material.<br>
An apparatus suitable for making one or more composite strands in thread or<br>
pellet form suitable for being molded into a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composite article<br>
includes a source of reinforcing fibers and, optionally, a source of one or more other types<br>
of fibers. One such source is a bushing of molten reinforcing material (e.g., glass) from<br>
which continuous reinforcing fibers can be drawn in sufficient numbers to form at least a<br>
portion, if not all, of the strand. It may also be desirable for the source of reinforcing fibers<br>
to be one or more spools or other packages of preformed reinforcing fibers. A source of<br>
preformed reinforcing fibers may be used in combination with a source of continuously<br><br>
formed reinforcing fibers. The source of fibers can also include matrix fibers that are<br>
continuously produced, tot example, from a bushing or spinner and/or are preformed and<br>
provided in suitable packaging, such as spools.<br>
Where glass reinforcing fibers are being formed, the fiber-forming<br>
mechanism forms the fibers from a source of molten glass fiber material, such as a<br>
conventional glass fiber-forming bushing. The fiber-forming operation may be conducted<br>
off-lirie-from or in-line with the balance of the apparatus. When the fibers being formed are<br>
glass reinforcing fibers, the fiber-forming mechanism forms the fibers from a source of<br>
molten glass reinforcing fiber material. In one embodiment, the fiber-forming mechanism<br>
forms the fibers such that they emanate heat energy for a time after being formed.<br>
An applicator is used for applying the chemical treatment to substantially all<br>
of the fibers. The applicator can be of a conventional or any other construction suitable for<br>
applying the desired type and amount of chemical treatment. The applicator may be<br>
disposed in-line with the fiber-forming mechanism for applying a chemical treatment to the<br>
fibers to form a plurality of coated fibers. The applicator applies the chemical treatment,<br>
which is substantially free of solvent and substantially non-photosetting.<br>
One embodiment of the apparatus includes an applicator system that applies<br>
the chemical treatment when the fibers are at a higher temperature than that of the applied<br>
chemical treatment. When the chemical treatment is applied, the fibers are at a sufficiently<br>
higher temperature to provide enough heat energy to cause the applied chemical treatment<br>
to lower its viscosity or heat cure at least partially (e.g., if the chemical treatment is a<br>
thenhoset), or both. The temperature of the fibers when the chemical treatment is applied,<br>
however, is not sufficient to cause significant decomposition of the applied chemical<br>
treatment. The difference in the temperatures of the applied chemical treatment and the<br>
fibers on which the treatment is being applied may be obtained by including a heat retainer<br>
as part of the applicator system. This difference in temperatures may also be obtained by<br>
disposing the applicator close enough (e.g., adjacent) to the fiber-forming mechanism so<br>
that the fibers are at a sufficiently higher temperature than the chemical treatment when it is<br>
applied. Such an applicator system may include a heat retainer disposed so as to help<br>
maintain the temperature of the fibers, or at least reduce the rate of temperature drop, during<br>
and/or after the chemical treatment is applied.<br><br>
A gathering shoe or some other gatherer or bundler is used to gather the<br>
treated fibers together into at least one strand. The strand may then be coated or encased<br>
with a suitable polymeric material, preferably a thermoplastic, and formed into the desired<br>
composite article.<br>
The material used to coat or encase the chemically treated strand can be<br>
provided from a source of molten thermoplastic material, such as from an extruder. To coat<br>
the treated strand and form an encased composite strand, the treated strand may be pulled or<br>
otherwise passed through a suitable coating device. For example, encased composite<br>
strands can be formed by pulling or otherwise passing a number of the strands through a<br>
corresponding number of dies, with each die having at least one exit orifice sized to form<br>
the coating into a thermoplastic sheath of the desired thickness (e.g., that yielding a<br>
thermoplastic-to-glass weight ratio of from about 30:70 to about 70:30),<br>
Preferably, a wire coater is used to encase the strands. A wire coater is a<br>
device or group of devices capable of coating one or more strands with a plastic material so<br>
as to form a sheath of relatively uniform thickness on each strand. Preferably, the wire<br>
coater includes some form of a die that shapes the sheath to the desired uniform thickness<br>
and/or cross-section.<br>
The strand is fed or passed through the coating device using a suitable<br>
device. For example, a puller may be used to pull the strand through the wire coater. This<br>
puller can be separate from or part of the wire coater. A chopper may be adapted to also<br>
function as a puller or aid the puller in pulling the strand through the wire coater.<br>
The resulting coated or encased composite strand can be cut or otherwise<br>
separated into discrete lengths to form a plurality of encased composite pellets, or wound or<br>
otherwise packaged to form an encased composite thread. The chemical treatment helps<br>
keep the fibers together in each polymer-encased composite pellet or thread.<br>
A composite article can be made by molding one or more of the encased<br>
composite strands form at least part, and may form all, of the matrix of the composite<br>
article to be molded. Exemplary molding processes used to form the composite article<br>
include injection molding, compression molding, and other suitable molding teclmiques.<br><br>
Figs. 1-3 illustrate a preferred embodiment for chemically treating a plurality<br>
of fibers 10 suitable for making a composite article. A typical composite article comprises<br>
a plurality of reinforcing fibers 12 disposed in a matrix of polymeric material.<br>
In addition to reinforcing fiben.12, the fibers 10 may also include other<br>
types of fibers suitable for making a composite article, such as matrix fibers 13. The matrix<br>
fibers 13 are preferably made from a polymeric matrix material and form at least part of the<br>
matrix. The reinforcing fibers 12 may be glass, which may be continuously drawn from a<br>
source of molten glass reinforcing material (e.g., a conventional glass fiber-forming<br>
bushing as shown in Figs. 1 and 2). Continuously formed glass reinforcing fibers are<br>
especially advantageous since heat energy remaining in the glass fibers from the forming<br>
process may be employed to efficiently provide heat to the applied chemical treatment. In<br>
addition to or instead of using continuously formed glass fibers, the reinforcing fibers 12<br>
may include preformed reinforcing fibers made from glass and/or synthetic reinforcing<br>
materials.<br>
The term "preformed" refers to fibers that arc formed off-line before being<br>
supplied, or provided with a chemical treatment in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The term "glass" means an inorganic product of fusion that solidifies to a rigid,<br>
noncrystalline condition upon cooling, and is intended to include common silicate glasses<br>
as well as glassy mineral materials suitable for making reinforcing fibers, such as<br>
borosilicate glass, glass wool, rock wool, slag wool, and mineral wool. Contrastingly,<br>
"synthetic" reinforcing materials are non-glass materials, such as Kevlar®, carbon or<br>
graphite, silicon carbide (SiC), and other non-glass materials having suitable reinforcing<br>
characteristics. When fibers made from different materials are used, it is contemplated that<br>
the same or a different chemical treatment can be used for each type of fiber.<br>
In one embodiment, the chemical treatment is applied according to methods<br>
and using apparatus which use heat energy to effect at least one of two changes in the<br>
applied chemical. Heat energy may be used to lower the viscosity, which improves the<br>
wetting ability of a chemical treatment that has been applied to the fibers. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, heat energy may be used to increase the molecular weight of, or otherwise<br>
cure, the applied chemical treatment. Figs. 1 and 2 depict exemplary embodiments of<br>
apparatus and methods for applying the chemical treatments.<br><br>
The chemical treatment used to coat fibers 10 has a relatively low molecular<br>
weight and viscosity compared to the matrix material, and is also substantially free of an<br>
unreadable solvent. An "unreactable solvent" (e.g., water and certain organic solvents) is a<br>
solvent that evaporates out of the chemical treatment in the presence of heat energy rather<br>
than reacts with a constituent of the chemical treatment or the matrix material. The<br>
chemical treatment is substantially "solvent-free"-i.e., essentially free of such a<br>
substantially unreactable solvent Thus, there may be traces of an unreactable solvent in the<br>
chemical treatment, but the amount of the solvent present is not enough, by itself, to<br>
significantly lower the viscosity of the chemical treatment (i.e., affect the ability of the<br>
chemical treatment to wet the fibers). In addition, the applied chemical treatment is<br>
sufficiently free of any unreactable solvents such that no substantial amount of water vapor,<br>
VOC vapor, or other solvent vapor is generated when the chemical treatment is heated,<br>
including during molding of the composite article. By being solvent-free, the present<br>
chemical treatment can have its viscosity reduced and/or be heat-cured without<br>
experiencing a substantial drop in mass. Thus, most of the chemical treatment that is<br>
applied to the fibers 10 remains on the fibers.<br>
That the chemical treatment is solvent-free, however, does not preclude the<br>
use of one or more additives in the chemical treatment that are soluble or compatible with<br>
the other ingredients (e.g., the coupling agent). For example, a compatible viscosity<br>
modifier, such as a HELOXY® (epoxy functional modifier) product available from Shell<br>
Chemical Company, e.g., a digtycidyl ether of 1,4-butanediol (HELOXY Modifier 67) or a<br>
polyglycidyl ether of castor oil (HELOXY Modifier 505), can be used in a film-former<br>
system to interact or react one or more other ingredients to lower the viscosity of the<br>
chemical treatment, instead of being driven off in the form of a vapor when in the presence<br>
of heatenergy.-<br>
The chemical treatment is also not curable by actinic radiation (i.e., is non-<br>
photosetting) to any substantial degree. That is, the chemical treatment does not<br>
photochemically react to cure or significantly increase in viscosity due to the effect of<br>
actinic radiation.<br>
The chemical treatment, which may be thermosetting or thermoplastic in<br>
nature, is used for sizing and/or preimpregnating the number of reinforcing fibers 12 needed<br>
to obtain the composite properties desired. The chemical treatment may also be used for<br><br>
sizing and/or preimpregnating other types of fibers 10, such as fibers 13 made from a<br>
polymeric matrix material.<br>
Matrix fibers may be either continuously formed in-line or preformed, and<br>
are subsequently used to form part or all of the matrix of the composite article. Where<br>
matrix fibers are used, the step of applying the chemical treatment can include sizing and/or<br>
preimpregnating the matrix fibers with the same or a different chemical treatment than that<br>
applied to the reinforcing fibers.<br>
In most cases preimpregnation as well as sizing is desired, and therefore it is<br>
preferable for the same chemical treatment to be used for both sizing and preimpregnating<br>
the fibers 10. Optionally, however, one chemical treatment may be used to size the<br>
reinforcing and/or matrix fibers, and another chemical treatment may be used to<br>
preimpregnate the reinforcing and/or matrix fibers. If different types of matrix fibers are<br>
used, it may be preferable for a different chemical treatment to be applied to each type of<br>
matrix fiber.<br>
Sizing fibers involves applying at least a monolayer of the chemical<br>
treatment onto the surface of each fiber. Glass reinforcing fibers 12 are generally<br>
considered sized when a chemical treatment content of from 0.1% to 1%, e.g., on the order<br>
of about 0.5%, by weight based on the total weight of the treated fibers, is applied onto the<br>
fibers 12. Preimpregnating involves coating or otherwise applying a sufficient amount of<br>
the chemical treatment to a plurality of fibers to substantially fill in the spaces between the<br>
fibers when the fibers 10 are formed into a bundle or strand 14. A bundle or strand 14 of<br>
glass reinforcing fibers 12 is generally considered preimpregnated when the strand 14 has a<br>
chemical treatment content of from about 2% to about 25% by weight.<br>
The fibers may be sized without being preimpregnated at the same time, for<br>
example, when the chemical treatment is applied in a low quantity and/or when it has a<br>
sufficiently low viscosity. The viscosity of a chemical treatment may be adjusted by<br>
adjusting its temperature. For example, the viscosity of the treatment may be suitably<br>
adjusted after it is applied by employing the heat present in the fiber.<br>
Preferably at least the reinforcing fibers 12 of the strand fibers 10 are coated<br>
with a chemical treatment in an amount of from about 2% to about 15% by weight, more<br>
preferably from about 5% to about 15% by weight, and even more preferably with about<br>
8% by weight (based on the weight of the treated fibers). A conventional loss on ignition<br><br>
(LOI) method can be used to determine how much of the applied chemical treatment is on<br>
the fibers 12, which ate preferably glass.<br>
A preferred LOI range or value is the one that gives the desired composite<br>
strand properties at the lowest cost At an LOI value of 8%, sample strands 14 have been<br>
found to be well impregnated but not wet to the touch. LOI values that are too low may<br>
cause fuzzing of the strand 14 (i.e., breakage of a number of individual glass fibers in the<br>
strand) in subsequent in-line or off-line processing and handling. But the more chemical<br>
treatment added, the more the final product will cost. Higher LOI values may also bleed<br>
low viscosity components but of the strand 14. In any event, an LOI value of from about<br>
25% to about 40% by weight is preferred for making a composite article with all the matrix<br>
polymer being provided by the composite strand 14.<br>
Thus, fibers 10 can be chemically treated in accordance with the present<br>
invention to form aprepreg (preimpregnated composite strand) 14, or a composite strand 14<br>
that contains only sized fibers 10. One or more of the composite strands 14 can be<br>
subsequently processed, in-line or off-line, into a variety of composite articles. For<br>
example, the step of forming the composite strand may be accomplished in-line with a<br>
gathering step. Exemplary composite articles into which a strand 14 may be formed<br>
include a mat, fabric, sheet, panel, filament-wound pipe, pultruded article (pultrusion), or<br>
spray-up article (gun roving). The strands 14 may also be chopped into lengths or pellets<br>
suitable for use in injection or other molding processes to form composite articles.<br>
Generally, a chemical treatment according to the present invention<br>
comprises a film former and a coupling agent. The film former forms a layer of polymeric<br>
material around each fiber coated with the chemical treatment. The coupling agent helps<br>
bond or otherwise couple the film former to at least the reinforcing fiber. The coupling<br>
agent, if appropriate, can also be chosen to help the film former react or interact with the<br>
polymeric matrix material.<br>
The applied chemical treatment behaves as a thcrmosct or a thermoplastic.<br>
Also, the treatment can have both thermosetting and thermoplastic components--e.g., the<br>
treatment may contain a substantially thermoplastic polymer with reactive end groups that<br>
can participate in a thermosetting/curing reaction. The film former used in either type of<br>
chemical treatment may be the same polymeric material as that used for the composite<br>
matrix.<br><br>
A thermosetting-type chemical treatment is partially or fully heat-curable<br>
and substantially non-photosetting, and may be used with a polymeric matrix material that<br>
is either a thcrmoset or is thermoplastic. If the chemical treatment behaves as a thermoset,<br>
applied heat energy may at least partially cure and cause an increase in the viscosity of at<br>
least the portion of the applied chemical treatment being cured. A preferred chemical<br>
treatment is heat-curable at temperatures of about 350°C (66"2°F) and below.<br>
"In-exemplary thermosetdng-type chemical treatments, the film former<br>
preferably comprises eitherone or more relatively low molecular weight mono-functional<br>
monomers, one or more relatively low or high molecular weight multi-functional<br>
monomers, or a combination thereof. A mono-functional monomer has one reaction site<br>
per molecule, while a multi-functional monomer has two or more reaction sites per<br>
molecule. The monomer is heat-curable without generating a substantial amount of water<br>
vapor, volatile organic carbon vapor, or other solvent vapor. For example, the film former<br>
used in a thermosetting-type chemical treatment may include at least one low molecular<br>
weight functional monomer from the group including, e.g.. a polyester alkyd, an epoxy<br>
resin, and a combination of glycidyl ether functional groups sufficient to form a film on<br>
each fiber yet not constitute an epoxy resin. Other suitable functional monomers for use as<br>
all or part of a film former include urethane, vinyl ester, amic acid, Diels Alder reactive<br>
species (such as dienes or dieneophiles), and molecules that can undergo Cope<br>
rearrangement. The molecular weight of the functional monomers is suitably low<br>
compared to the matrix material to obtain a chemical treatment having a low viscosity.<br>
In exemplary thermoplastic-type chemical treatments, the film former<br>
preferably comprises at least one low molecular weight thermoplastic polymeric material<br>
which has a relatively low viscosity at elevated temperatures. Thermoplastics usually have<br>
relativelyhigh molecular weights, and thus high viscosities, compared to typical uncured<br>
thermosets. However, such high molecular weight thermoplastics may still be used in the<br>
film former of a thermoplastic-type chemical treatment if cracked or otherwise processed to<br>
a sufficiently low molecular weight High molecular weight thermoplastics, for example,<br>
polyethylene terephthalatc (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), other polyesters, and<br>
polyamides such as nylon may be adequately cracked for this purpose.<br>
Some thermoplastics even when cracked may have an undesirably high<br>
viscosity. In such cases, a processing aid or a viscosity modifier may be used in the film-<br><br>
former system. For instance, a monomer equivalent of the thermoplastic material, or a<br>
mixture of a monomer equivalent and an oligomer (e.g., a cracked thermoplastic material),<br>
may be used as a processing aid with a high molecular weight thermoplastic. Exemplary<br>
thermoplastic monomer equivalents include di-n-butyl terephthalate and the di-benzoate<br>
ester of 1,4-butanediol for PBTs; diethyl terephthalate and the dibenzoate ester of ethylene<br>
glycol for PETs; and caprolactone, the adduct of adipoylchloride and n-aminohexane, and<br>
the adduct of 1,6-hexanediamine and hexanoylchloride for nylons. In these examples, the<br>
monomer equivalent molecules may act as processing aids to allow high molecular weight<br>
thermoplastics such as PBT, PET, and nylon to form at least part of the film former in the<br>
chemical treatment.<br>
The above exemplary monomer-equivalent processing aids may be used<br>
with other thermoplastics, and/or they may be made reactive and used with thermosets or<br>
thermoplastics. Satisfactory results have been obtained using butoxyethylstearate (BES) as<br>
a processing aid in the BES-containing chemical treatments described in the examples<br>
below for thermoset matrices. Preferably, such processing aids contain the same kinds of<br>
functional groups as the matrix polymer. There may be myriad molecules and/or<br>
combinations of molecules that may be useful as monomer equivalent processing aids.<br>
If the chemical treatment behaves as a thermoset, a step of heating is<br>
preferably used to at least partially cure the applied chemical treatment and cause an<br>
increase in the viscosity of at least the portion of the applied chemical treatment being<br>
cured (i.e., the part most directly exposed to the heat). This increase in viscosity can be<br>
caused by an increase in molecular weight as the thermoset-type chemical treatment cures.<br>
The thcrmosctting-type film former is heat-curable without generating a substantial amount<br>
of solvent vapor when heated. Preferably, the functional monomers used for the film<br>
former are heat-curable at temperatures of about 350°C (662°F) and below, because the risk v<br>
of permanent degradation increases to an undesirable degree for many chemical treatments<br>
at temperatures of above about 350°C (662°F).<br>
If the applied chemical treatment behaves as a thermoplastic, the heating can<br>
cause a decrease in the viscosity of at least the portion of the applied chemical treatment<br>
most directly exposed to the heat (e.g., adjacent to a hot fiber). If the viscosity is lowered<br>
during the heating step, preferably there is enough of a drop in viscosity to improve as<br>
desired the ability of the applied thermoplastic-type chemical treatment to wet the fibers 10<br><br>
(to coat the fibers and interact with the fiber surface). The wetting of the applied chemical<br>
treatment on the fibers 10 is more likely to improve when a drop in viscosity occurs for at<br>
least the portion of the applied chemical treatment located adjacent to the fiber surface. To<br>
reduce the chance of permanent degradation while being heated, it is also preferable for the<br>
thermoplastic-type film former in particular, and for the thermoplastic-type chemical<br>
treatment as a whole, to exhibit a sufficiently low viscosity at temperatures of about 3 50°C<br>
(662°F) and below.<br>
The viscosity of either type of chemical treatment is low enough to at least<br>
partially, if not fully, wet the fibers 10 when the chemical treatment is initially applied. To<br>
be able to apply the chemical treatment using conventional equipment (e.g., with a standard<br>
single- or dual-roll applicator 26) without causing the fibers 10, in particular glass fibers, to<br>
break in oignifionntly high numbow, tho chemical treatment preferably has a viscosity of<br>
about 1000 cps or less before being applied. The lower me viscosity of the chemical<br>
treatment being applied, the faster the fibers 10 can be processed without causing<br>
significant fiber breakage. Thus, more preferably the chemical treatment before being<br>
applied has a viscosity of about 300 cps or less. In a preferred embodiment for<br>
advantageous processing of the fibers 10, the chemical treatment as it is applied has a<br>
viscosity on the order of about 50 cps, more preferably of about 10 cps, as measured by a<br>
conventional viscometer (e.g., a Brookfield or ICI viscometer).<br>
The following are specific examples of film formers divided into two main<br>
categories: liquid and meltable. In the "liquid" category, there are three examples of<br>
maleate-based film formers that have been synthesized. In addition, there are twelve<br>
epoxy-based film formers prepared from commercially available ingredients. There is<br>
another liquid film former (allyl propoxylate urethane) which can be used in either a<br>
-type or a thermoplastic-type chemical treatment. In the "meltable" category<br>
the-two film-former systems, each prepared from a commercially available<br>
polycploectone and one of the liquid film formers. The exemplary polycaprolactone<br>
system is a..solid polymer at room temperature. These exemplary film formers are all<br>
processable in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Examples 1- 6: Liquid Film Formers<br>
Example 1--Propyleneglycal-Fumarate;<br><br>
A conventional ten-gallon (38 L) stainless steel reactor was charged with<br>
17.02 kg of propylene glycol (available from Ashland Chemical Company of Columbus,<br>
Ohio) and 12.98 kg of fumaric acid (available from Huntsman Specialty Chemical of Salt<br>
Lake City, Utah). For stability, 3.62 g (120 ppm) of toluhydroquinone (THQ) (available<br>
from Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was added into the reactor.<br>
The molar ratio of the charge was 2:1 propylene glycol (PG) to fumaric acid (FA). The<br>
mixture was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 380°F (193°C) for five hours. The<br>
cndpoiut of the reaction was determined by the viscosity of the PG-FA product, which was<br>
360 to 450 cps at 120°F (49°C) as determined by a cone-and-plate viscometer, such as that<br>
made by ICI of Wilmington, Delaware. The acid value at the reaction endpoint is typically<br>
observed to be 10 to 36 Meq KOH/g of alkyd (milliequivalcnt of potassium hydroxide per<br>
gram of alkyd). This material may be used directly as a film former.<br>
Example 2--Propoxylated Bisphenol-A-Maleate:<br>
A 50-gallon (189 L) stainless steel reactor was charged with 159.68 kg of<br>
propoxylated bisphenol-A (available from Milliken Chemical oflnman, South Carolina)<br>
and 20.33 kg of maleic anhydride (available from Huntsman Specialty Chemical). For<br>
stability, 18 g (100 ppm) of hydroquinone (HQ) (available from Aldrich Chemical<br>
Company) was added to the reactor. The mixture was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere<br>
at 175°F (79°C) for 2.5 hours, then at 275°F (135°C) for 3.5 hours. The endpoint of this<br>
reaction was determined by acid value-the reaction was considered to be complete when<br>
the acid value reached a level of 63.6 Meq KOH/g of alkyd and no more maleic anhydride<br>
was observed by infrared spectroscopy. The viscosity of this product ranges from 100 to<br>
130 cps at a temperature of 200oF (93°C) as measured by an ICI cone-and-plate viscometer.<br>
This material may be used directly as a film former.<br>
Example 3-Propoxlated AHyl Alcohol-Maleate:<br>
A 15-gallon (57 L) stainless steel reactor was charged with 15.49 kg of<br>
propoxylated allyl alcohol (available from Arco Chemical Company of New Town Square,<br>
Pennsylvania) and 9.88 kg of maleic anhydride (available from Huntsman Specialty<br>
Chemical). For stability, 2.53 g (100 ppm) of HQ was added to the reactor. The mixture<br>
was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 250-300cF (121 -149°C) for four hours. The<br>
reaction endpoint was when the acid value reached a level of 263.4 Meq KOH/g of alkyd<br>
ind no more maleic anhydride was observed by infrared spectroscopy. The viscosity of this<br><br>
product ranges from 100-130 cps at a temperature of 200°F (9.1 °C) as measured by an ICl<br>
cone-and-plate viscometer. This material may be used directly as a film former.<br>
Examples 4A-K--Low-Viscosity Epoxy Systems:<br>

(diglycidyl ether of 1,4-butanediol), and HELOXY Modifier 505 (polyglycidyl ether of<br>
castor oil). All of the epoxy-based film-former systems listed below have a viscosity below<br>

Example 5--High-Viscositv Epoxy:<br>
In addition to the above-noted epoxy systems, an exemplary higher<br>
temperature, higher viscosity epoxy film-former system is a one-to-one mixture of DER<br>
337 epoxy resin (available from Dow Chemical) and Araldite GT7031 (available from<br>
Ciba Gcigy Corp. of Switzerland). This film former has a viscosity of 350-450 cps at<br>
?00°F (93°C) as determined using a Brookfield viscometer.<br>
Example 6-Allyl Propoxylate Urethane:<br>
A 12-Hter three-neck, round-bottom glass reactor equipped with a heating<br>
mujitic, a Freidrieh condenser, a 1-liter addition fiuuiei, an electric overhead stirrer, and a<br>
thermocouple temperature probe was charged with 3.63 kg (21.6 mol) of Desmodur H<br><br>
(hexamethylenediisocyanate, available from Bayer Chemical of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).<br>
To this was added 0.5 g (50 pprh) of dibutyl tin dilaurate (available from Aldrich Chemical<br>
Company). Next, 6.37 kg (43.6 mol) of ARCAL Allyl Proproxylate 1375 (propoxylated<br>
allyl alcohol, available from Arco Chemical Company) was added via the addition funnel,<br>
the allyl propoxylate was added dropwise and the temperature was maintained at 80°C by<br>
varying the addition rate and the temperature of the healing mantle. When the addition was<br>
complete, the temperature of the reactor contents was maintained at 80°C for three (3) hours<br>
or for a time until the 2200 wave number peak in the infrared spectrum of the reaction<br>
mixture, corresponding to the isocyanate groups of the Desmodur H, disappeared. This<br>
film former may be used directly without any purification or further manipulation.<br>

Example 7--Propoxlated Bisphenol-A Maleate/TONE 0260<br>
The propoxylated bisphenol-A maleate from Example 2 was mixed with<br>
TONE 0260 (a polycaprolactone polymer available from Union Carbide) in a weight ratio<br>
of one-to-one. This mixture is a solid at room temperature, but has a viscosity of 50-250<br>
cps at a temperature of200-230°F (93 - 110°C).<br>
Example 8-Propoxlated Allyl Alcohol Maleate/TONE 0260<br>
The propoxylated allyl alcohol maleate from Example 3 was mixed with<br>
TONE 0260 in a weight ratio of 1:1. This mixture is a solid at room temperature, but has a<br>
viscosity of 50-250 cps at a temperature of 200-230°F (93-110°C).<br>
Optional Ingredients<br>
In addition to or instead of other viscosity modifiers such as those mentioned<br>
above, n-butyl amic acid may also be used as a modifier where it is suitably reaclive with<br>
either thermoplastic or thermosetting materials to lower the viscosity of the film former and<br>
the overall chemical treatment. A preferred amic-acid reactive modifier was prepared as<br>
follows:<br>
A 2-liter three-neck, round-bottom glass reactor equipped with a heating<br>
mantle, a Freidrich condenser, a 1-liter addition funnel, an electric overhead stirrer, and a<br>
thermocouple temperature probe was charged with 150 g (1.53 mol) of mnleic anhydride<br>
(available from Huntsman Specialty Chemical) and 0.02 g of hydroquinone (available from<br>
Aldrich Chemical Co.). These solids were dissolved by the addition of 350 ml of acetone<br>
(high-purity grade available from Aldrich Chemical). The solution of maleic anhydride and<br><br>
hydroquinone was stirred in the reactor. A solution of 111 g (1.51 mol) of n-butyl amine<br>
(available from Aldrich Chemical) in 150 ml of acetone was added to the reactor. The n-<br>
butyl amine solution was added dropwise, and the (temperature was maintained at 55 °C by<br>
varying the addition rate and the temperature of the heating mantle. Once the addition was<br>
complete, the temperature of the reactor and contents was maintained at 60°C for three<br>
hours. The acetone was then removed at reduced pressure and 60°C by rotary evaporation.<br>
The solid n-butyl amic acid product was removed from the reactor as a liquid at 90°C,<br>
which may be used directly without further purificttion or manipulation. A small portion<br>
of the n-butyl amic acid produced was recrystallizad from acetone. The melting point of<br>
the recrystallized material was 74.9°C by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Coupling Agents<br>
For either a thermosetting or thermoplastic chemical treatment, the coupling<br>
agent comprises a functionalized organic substrate (i.e., at least one organic functional<br>
group bonded to an organic substrate). Exemplary types of functionalized organic<br>
substrates include alcohols, amines, esters, ethers, hydrocarbons, siloxaucs, silazaiies,<br>
silar.es, lactams, lactones, anhydrides, cavbenes. nitrenes, orthoestcrs, imides, diamines,<br>
imines, amides, imides, and olefins. The functionalized organic substrate is capable of<br>
interacting and/or reacting with the surface of the fibers at elevated temperatures<br>
(preferably, of from about 100°C (2I2°F) to about 350°C (662°F)) so as to produce<br>
sufficient coupling or bonding between the reinforcing fibers and matrix material to achieve<br>
the desired properties. Interaction involves bonding resulting from an attracting force, such<br>
as hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals bonding. Reacting involves chemical bonding,<br>
which is typically covalent bonding. The functionalized organic substrate can also be<br>
interactive or reactive with the matrix material. Exemplary coupling agents include silanes<br>
such as gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (A-l 100), gamma-methacryloxy-<br>
propyltrimclhoxysilane (A-174), and gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (A-187),<br>
which are all available from Witco Chemical Company of Chicago, Illinois. Non-silane<br>
coupling agents may also be used. By choosing one or more suitable functionalized organic<br>
substrates for the coupling-agent system, the desired mechnnicnl properties between the<br>
reinforcing fibers and the matrix material in the composite article can be obtained.<br>
While not intending to be limited to any theory regarding the chemical<br>
treatments, a possible explanation of how the treatments may operate is provided below.<br><br>
Silane-type coupling agents are typically found in aqueous-based chemical treatments.<br>
Under a current view, with a conventional silane-type coupling agent the alkoxysilnne<br>
portion of the molecule undergoes hydrolysis to become a hydroxysilane or si land to<br>
water-solubilize the coupling agent. One end of the molecule reacts or interacts with the<br>
glass surface and the other end of the molecule reacts or interacts with the matrix material.<br>
More particularly, coupling agents that have typically been used in the glass industry are<br>
organosilanes, which have an organic portion thought to react or interact with the matrix<br>
polymer and a silane portion, or more specifically a silanol portion, thought to react or<br>
interact wiUi the glass surface. Also, in some cases, it is generally accepted that the organic<br>
portion of an organosilane is capable of reacting (e.g., covalent or ionic bonding) or<br>
interacting (e.g., hydrogen or Van der Waals bonding) with the glass surface. In general,<br>
hydrogen bonding and other associations arc thought to be thermodynamic (reversible<br>
under mild reaction conditions) processes. In some cases, such as when silanols bond to a<br>
glass surface, chemical bonding is considered a thermodynamic process. Thus, with<br>
previous coupling-agent technology, the bonding of aqueous-based chemical treatments to<br>
the glass occurs as a thermodynamic process. This is because conventional processes are<br>
usually conducted under relatively mild conditions and are usually reversible to a<br>
substantial degree. In a conventional process, after the glass fibers are coaled with an<br>
aqueous-based chemical treatment, the coated fibers are packaged and dried in an oven.<br>
While in the oven there is a potential for some of the organic functional groups of the<br>
coupling agent to react irreversibly with some of the organic functional groups in the film<br>
former. This does not happen to any great extent, however, because the oven temperatures<br>
typically being used, about 150-190°F (66-88°C), are not high enough.<br>
Contrastingly, with the solvent-free chemical treatments according to the<br>
present invention, the bonding or coupling process becomes more kinetic in nature. That is,<br>
the bonding may occur under relatively harsh conditions (e.g., at higher temperatures) and<br>
may involve a substantially irreversible reaction. Moreover, in addition to a coupling agent<br>
bonding to the fiber surface, an interphase region can now be formed between the<br>
reinforcing fibers and the matrix material of the composite article. The inteiphase region is<br>
formed, at least in part, by the applied chemical treatment. The interphase region may also<br>
include, in whole or in part, a region around the fiber where the chemical treatment and the<br><br>
matrix material have interacted and/or reacted with one another. The chemical treatment<br>
may also become completely dispersed or dissolved in the surrounding matrix material.<br>
Although conventional silane coupling agents may be used in the present<br>
chemical treatments, it is believed that the mechanism of their interaction or reaction with<br>
the glass surface differs from that which occurs in prior processes. Since there is essentially<br>
no water present during the present processing, the alkoxysilanes react directly with the<br>
glass surface to give a siloxane linkage and liberate alcohol. Indeed, there is experimental<br>
evidence (proton NMR data) that suggests that the alkoxysilanes do not hydrolyze in the<br>
present chemical treatments under the conditions to which they are exposed when processed<br>
in accordance with the invention. It is believed that the alkoxysilane group of the coupling<br>
agent used in the present chemical treatments is reacting or interacting with the glass<br>
surface in a kinetic fashion to form a siloxane linkage and liberate alcohol. Thus, the<br>
present process is kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, as evidenced by the observation that<br>
good composite properties have been obtained for both thermoset and thermoplastic<br>
composites when alkoxysilane coupling agents were present in the chemical treatments<br>
according to the invention, whereas less desirable composite properties have been obtained<br>
for both thermoset and thermoplastic composites when alkoxysilane coupling agents were<br>
not present in the chemical treatments.<br>
If an alkoxysilane coupling agent in a present chemical treatment reacts or<br>
interacts with a newly formed glass or other reinforcing fiber surface via some kinetic<br>
process, then other types of molecules containing sufficiently reactive functional groups,<br>
such as those noted above, will also react or interact with a glass or other reinforcing fiber<br>
surface via a kinetic process. Further, these same functional groups that react or interact<br>
with the glass or other fiber surface via a kinetic process may react or interact with the rest<br>
of the organic material in the chemical treatment and/or the matrix material via a kinetic<br>
process as well. This may then serve to build an interphase region at or very near the glass<br>
or other fiber surface, and may also serve to increase the average molecular weight of the<br>
chemical treatment, thereby imparting desirable physical characteristics to the resulting<br>
glass strand product. Thus, advantages of the present invention include the flexibility to<br>
use a wider variety of coupling agents and to build an interphase region between the fiber<br>
and the matrix.<br><br>
For the composite article to exhibit desirable mechanical properties between<br>
the reinforcing fibers and the matrix material, the chemical treatment is preferably<br>
compatible with the matrix material of the composite article. In general, a chemical<br>
treatment is considered compatible with the matrix material if it is capable of interacting<br>
with and/or reacting with the matrix material. The film former of cither type of applied<br>
chemical treatment may comprise the same polymeric material as the matrix material and<br>
be provided in an amount sufficient to form part or all of the matrix of the composite<br>
article.<br>
The chemical treatments may be misciblc in the matrix material, in whole or<br>
in part, and/or may form a separate phase from the matrix material. If a separate phase, the<br>
chemical treatment disposed around each fiber may form a plurality of separate phase<br>
regions dispersed in the matrix material and/or a single, separate phase region surrounding<br>
its corresponding fiber.<br>
When it is desirable for the composite article to be made with one type of<br>
chemical treatment and a different type of matrix material, a thcrmoselling-typc chemical<br>
treatment is preferably used with a thermoplastic matrix. A low molecular weight<br>
thermosetting-type chemical treatment can cure during thermoplastic processing and/or<br>
may react with the chain ends of the thermoplastic matrix material. Consequently, such<br>
types of molecules will not readily plasticize the thermoplastic matrix material. In<br>
choosing an appropriate chemical treatment, one should note that some low molecular<br>
weight thermoplastic materials can plasticize thermoplastic matrix resins when the chemical<br>
structure of the thermoplastic matrix resin and the low molecular weight thermoplastic<br>
material arc very different. An example of such different thermoplastic materials is<br>
dibutylterephthalate as part of the chemical treatment and polypropylene as the matrix<br>
material.<br>
Optionally, the chemical treatment may further comprise a compatibilizer for<br>
improving the interaction and/or reaction between the chemical treatment and the matrix<br>
material, thereby making otherwise non-compatible or less compatible polymeric<br>
components or ingredients of the treatment more compatible (e.g., more miscible) in the<br>
matrix material. When a thermosetting or thermoplastic chemical treatment is used with a<br>
thermoplastic matrix material, exemplary compatibilizers include the PBT monomer<br>
equivalents di-n-butyl terephthalate and dibenzoate ester of 1,4-butanediol; the PET<br><br>
monomer equivalents diethyl terephthalate and dibenzoate ester of ethylene glycol; and the<br>
nylon monomer equivalents caprolactone, the adduct of adipoylchloride and n-<br>
aminohexane, and the adduct of 1,6-hexanediarnine and hexanoylchloridc.<br>
When either type of chemical treatment is used with a thermosetting matrix<br>
material, it is preferable to use a more reactive campatibilizer. For example, for a polyester<br>
or vinylester thermoset, a suitable compatibiliaer is glycidyl methacrylate end-capped<br>
diacids and esters of the trimellitlc anhydride system. Specific examples of suitable<br>
compatibilizers for polyester and vinylester thennosets include diallylphthalate (DAP,<br>
which is commercially available), glycidylmetbacrylate-capped isophthalic acid, trimellitic-<br>
anhydride-dodecinate, bis-allylalcohol adduct of terephthalic acid and<br>
CH3CH2(OCH2CH2)n(CH2)mCO2H, where n is an integer from 3 to 7 and m is 16 (e.g.,<br>
CBA-60, available from Witco Chemical of Chicago, Illinois). For epoxy-based<br>
thermosets, esters based on glycidol may be suitable compatibilizers, such as<br>
glycidylmethacrylate by itself, diglycidylcster of adipic acid, and triglycidylisocyanurate<br>
(TGIC).<br>
The chemical treatment may also include one or more processing aids to<br>
facilitate the use of the chemical treatment at some point during the manufacturing process<br>
and/or to optimize the properties of the resulting composite article. For a thermosetting-<br>
type chemical treatment, the processing aid can Include, e.g., a viscosity reducer for<br>
reducing the viscosity of the thermosetting-type chemical treatment before it is applied to<br>
the fibers. The viscosity reducer is substantially solvent-free and preferably aids the curing<br>
of a thermosetting film former. The processing aids used in the thermosetting-type<br>
chemical treatment can include, e.g., styrene and peroxide. Styrenes are preferably used to<br>
thin the film former and participate in the thermoset reaction. Peroxides preferably function<br>
as a catalyst or curing agent<br>
Optionally, non-aqueous versions of other types of additives typically used<br>
to size glass fibers may also be employed as processing aids in the present chemical<br>
treatments. For example, processing aids or additives may be employed to help control the<br>
lubricity of the glass tow or strand, control the relative amount of static generated, or<br>
control the handleability of the glass strand or tow product. Lubricity may be modified by<br>
adding processing aids or lubricating agents, for example, a polyethylencglycol ester<br>
emulsion in mineral oil (e.g., Emeriube 7440, available from Henkel Textile Technologies<br><br>
of Charlotte, North Carolina); polyethyleooglycols, e.g., PEG-400-MO (polyethylene glycol<br>
monooleate) and PEG-400-monoisoatoarale (available from the Henkcl Corporation); and<br>
butoxyethylstearate (BES). These lubricating agents serve to enhance the runability of the<br>
glass by acting as lubricants, and when used judiciously should have little, if any, adverse<br>
affect on the properties of the finished composite article. Static generation may be<br>
controlled by adding processing aids such as polyethyleneimines, for example Emery 6760-<br>
0 and Emery 6760-U (available from Henkel Corporation). Handleability may be<br>
enhanced with processing aids such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (e.g., PVP K90, available<br>
from GAF Corporation of Wayne, New Jersey), which can provide good strand integrity<br>
and cohesiveness, and wetting agents or surfactants such as Pluronic Li01 and Pluronic<br>
PI 05 (both available from BASF Corporation), which can improve the ability of the matrix<br>
material to wet the fibers. Any ingredient present, however, has a formulation and is added<br>
in an amount such that the chemical treatment remains solvent-free.<br>
Preferred embodiments of methods and apparatus for applying the inventive<br>
chemical treatments will now be further described in reference to the drawings. Fig. 1<br>
illustrates one embodiment of an apparatus 20 for applying a chemical treatment to fibers<br>
10 used in making a composite article, and includes a fiber-forming mechanism 22, such as<br>
a conventional glass fiber-forming bushing 24, which is operatively adapted according to<br>
well known practice for continuously forming a plurality of glass reinforcing fibers 12 from<br>
a source of molten glass material in a melter above the bushing 24. In this exemplary<br>
process, die glass reinforcing fibers 12 emanate heat energy for a time after being formed.<br>
One or more applicators 26, such as a standard single- or dual-roll style applicator 28 and<br>
pan 30, can be used to apply one of the above-described exemplary chemical treatments to<br>
the reinforcing fibers 12 in order to form a plurality of coated fibers 32. For the process to<br>
continue to run after the chemical treatment is applied, i.e., without having a substantial<br>
number of the. fibers 10 break, the viscosity of the chemical treatment is made to be<br>
sufficiently low before being applied or to drop a sufficient amount after being applied as<br>
discussed above.<br>
Two alternative processes for applying chemical treatment to newly formed<br>
glass fibers 12 are described below. Exemplary Process 1 is used when the viscosity of the<br>
chemical treatment is relatively low at relatively low temperatures (e.g., viscosities of 150<br>
cps or less at temperatures of 150°F (66°C) or less). Exemplary Process 2 is employed with<br><br>
higher-viscosity chemical treatments. Chemical treatments which include one of the film<br>
formers from the above Examples M(K) and 6 may be used in Process 1. Chemical<br>
' treatments which include one of the film formers from Examples 5,7 and 8 may be used<br>
witty Process 2. Any chemical treatment used in Process 1 can also be used in Process 2.<br>
Any chemical treatment that can be used in either Process 1 or Process 2 may also be used<br>
in Process 3, which is another exemplary system.<br>
Process 1:<br>
This process for applying a chemical treatment employs conventional glass<br>
reinforcing fiber-forming equipment modified in the area around applicator 26 such that the<br>
position of the applicator 26 is adjustable in a plane perpendicular to the stream of the glass<br>
fibers 12 (i.e., the flow of fibers 10) as well as the plane containing the fibers 10. The<br>
applicator 26 is fixed to a wheeled cart by means of a cantilever arm. The cart is on rails so<br>
that it may be easily positioned along the axis perpendicular to the direction of flow of the<br>
fibers. The top of the cart is connected to the main body of the cart by a scissors jack and<br>
worm gear arrangement This allows the applicator 26 to be raised or lowered relative to<br>
the bushing 24. The position of the applicator 26 can be adjusted along both axes while the<br>
process is running. The chemical treatment is stored in a metal pail, such as a 5-gallon<br>
(19 L) bucket<br>
Heating of the chemical treatment is optional. To heat the chemical<br>
treatment, the bucket may be placed on a hot plate and/or wrapped with a bucket heater,<br>
such as a Model 5 available from OHMTEMP Corporation of Oarden City, Michigan. The<br>
temperature of the chemical treatment is maintained at the desired level by means of a<br>
variable AC thermocouple-based heating controller, such as those which are available from<br>
major scientific supply houses such as Fisher Scientific or VWR Scientific. The chemical<br>
treatment is pumped to and from the applicator pan 30 by means of a peristaltic pump, such<br>
as a Masterflex model # 7529-8 equipped with a Masterflex pump controller model #7549-<br>
50 and Masterflex tubing part #6402-73, all available from Barnant Company (a division of<br>
Cole-Parmer, in Barrington, Illinois). The applicator 26 is of a standard design for a glass<br>
fiber-forming process, and consists of a metal pan 30 supporting a single graphite roller 28<br>
that is 3.0 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter and driven by an electric motor at speeds ranging<br>
Tom 3 to 20 feet (0.9 to 6.1 m) per minute. An alternative pump can be used to replace the<br>
)eristaltic pump, such as a Zenith pump model #60-20000-0939-4, available from Parker<br><br>
Hannifin Corporation, Zenith Pump Division, Sanford, NC. This alternative pump is a<br>
gear-type pump equipped with a heated feed and return hose assembly, and generally has<br>
the following features: Teflon-lined, high-pressure, 0.222" (0.564 cm) inside diameter x<br>
72" (183 cm) long, 12,000 psi (83 MPs) burst, 3000 psi (21 MPa) operating pressure,<br>
stainless steel, 7/16-20 thread JIC female swivel fittings, 120 volts, 300 watts, 100 ohm<br>
platinum RTD, 72" (183 cm) long cord with Amphenol #3106A-14S-06P plug, available<br>
from The Conrad Company, Inc., of Columbus, Ohio (the heated hose assembly is a<br>
difference between the two alternative (peristaltic vs. gear-type) pumping systems).<br>
Process 2:<br>
In another exemplary process, a dual-roll applicator is used for applying<br>
high-viscosity, elevated-temperature chemical treatments in non-aqueous form. The dual-<br>
roll applicator is fixed in position relative to the glass-forming apparatus. The position of<br>
the dual-roll applicator is essentially the same as that found in a standard glass fiber-<br>
forming process, which is approximately 50 inches (127 cm) from the bushing. The heating<br>
system and pumping system used for the chemical treatment in this process ore the same as<br>
described above for Process 1.<br>
The dual-roll applicator includes a secondary applicator roll, which is the<br>
larger of the two rolls, for transferring and metering the chemical treatment to a smaller,<br>
primary applicator roll. The primary roll is used to directly apply the chemical treatment to<br>
the fibers. The relatively small diameter of the primary roll reduces the drag between the<br>
roll and the fibers by providing a reduced contact area therebetween. Tension in the fibers<br>
is also reduced due to the reduction in drag. The thickness of the applied chemical<br>
treatment may be metered by controlling the gap between the primary and secondary rolls<br>
and by providing a doctor blade on the smaller roll. Such a dual-roll applicator is disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 3,817,728 to Petersen and U.S. Patent No. 3,506,419 to Smith et al., the<br>
disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Process 3:<br>
In this preferred embodiment, a dual-roll applicator of Process 2 and the<br>
positional adjustment capability of Process 1 are used together, along with the above-<br>
described heating and pumping systems for the chemical treatment. The coated fibers 32<br>
are gathered together into a strand 14 using a gathering mechanism 34, such as a<br>
conventional gathering shoe. A pulling mechanism 36, such as a conventional pair of<br><br>
opposing pull wheels, is used to continuously draw the fibers 12 from the bushing 24 in a<br>
manner well known in the art. The strand 14 can be wound on a package (not shown) or<br>
chopped into segments of desired length and stored for subsequent processing off-line into<br>
a composite article. Alternatively, the composite strand 14 can be processed directly into a<br>
composite article in-line with the gathering step.<br>
In addition to the continuously formed reinforcing fibers 12, the fibers 10<br>
can further compose a plurality of matrix fibers 13 made from a suitable matrix material. If<br>
matrix fibers 15 are used, the step of applying the chemical treatment can include sizing<br>
and/or preimpregnatingthe matrix fibers 13 with the same or a different chemical treatment<br>
than that applied to the reinforcing fibers 12. If different types of matrix fibers 13 are used,<br>
it may also be preferable for a different chemical treatment to be applied to each type of<br>
matrix fiber 13. Likewise, if different types of reinforcing fibers 12 are used, it may be<br>
preferable for a different chemical treatment to be applied to each type of reinforcing fiber<br>
12. The same techniques and equipment may be used to chemically treat each type of<br>
reinforcing fiber and matrix fiber, whether they are continuously formed or preformed.<br>
Chemical Treatment Examples<br>
Provided below arc examples of chemical treatments for applying to glass<br>
reinforcing fibers and various matrix fibers, and suitable for use with PBT, nylon, and<br>
polypropylene matrix resins. The various matrix fibers are made from the same material as<br>
the corresponding matrix resin. The designations "HEAT" and "NO HEAT" indicate that<br>
the listed chemical treatments are heated to a significant degree or not, respectively, after<br>
being applied to their corresponding fibers. The chemical treatments below for<br>
reinforcement fibers with "NO HEAT" may also be used on matrix fibers made from the<br>
corresponding matrix resin. When continuously formed glass fibers reach the applicator at<br>
a conventional location (e.g., the applicator being a significant distance from the source of<br>
molten glass), the glass fibers are still giving off some residual heat. At this distance from<br>
the bushing, however, the amount of heat emanating from the fibers may not be enough to<br>
have any significant affect on some of the applied chemical treatments. The designation<br>
"NO HEAT" therefore covers such a situation.<br>

The chemical treatment of 99% allylpropoxylate-urethane and 1% Al 100<br>
was applied to glass fibers, the coated fibers were formed into a composite strand, the<br>
composite strand was wire coated or encased with a sheath of nylon thermoplastic matrix<br>
material, the encased composite strand was chopped into pellets, and the pellets were<br>
injection molded into composite test specimens. The encased composite pellets were<br>
formed using the inventive wire-coating process described further below. The glass fibers<br>
in these composite test specimens were not completely dispersed in the matrix material.<br>
This lack of complete dispersion of the glass fibers from individual strands in the finished<br><br>
composite article indicates that at least a portion of the chemical treatment reacted enough,<br>
at some point during the manufacturing process, to prevent the fibers from separating and<br>
dispersing into the molten matrix material during die molding of the composite article (i.e.,<br>
to maintain strand cohesion). To reduce its reactivity (i.e., to reduce fiber cohesion in each<br>
composite strand during the composite-article molding process) and thereby obtain more<br>
dispersion of the reinforcing fibers In the matrix material, the aUylpropoxylate-urethane<br>
may be diluted with another film fonner-e.g., for a nylon system, TONE 0260 (a<br>
polycaprolactone, available from Union Carbide Corp.) may be used.<br>
The following are further examples of thermoset-type and thermoplastic-<br>
type chemical treatments according to the present invention.<br>
Nylon-Based Chemical Treatment:<br>
An especially preferred nylon-based thermoplastic-type chemical treatment<br>
was prepared by depositing about 9 kg of a polycaprolactone, specifically TONE 0260<br>
(available from Union Carbide Corporation), and about 9 kg of a polyester alkyd,<br>
specifically propoxylated bisphenol-A-maleate, into separate 5-gallon (19 L) metal cans.<br>
Upon the complete melting or liquefying of these two materials, they were combined in a<br>
heated five-gallon (19 L) can and stirred until the mixture became homogeneous. The<br>
temperature was maintained at or above 200°F (93°C) with constant stirring until complete<br>
mixing was achieved (about 30 minutes). The heating was then discontinued and the<br>
mixture was allowed to cool to 190°F (88°C). While the temperature was maintained at<br>
190°F,(88°C), about 360 g of the amine silanc coupling agent A-l 100 (gamma-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane) was added to the mixture with constant stirring. The resulting<br>
chemical treatment contained, by weight, 49-49.5% TONE 0260,49-49.5% propoxylated<br>
bisphenol-A-maleate, and 1-2% A-l 100. This chemical treatment was solid at about 25CC<br>
and had a viscosity of 660 cps at 75°C, 260 cps at 100°C, 120 cps at 125°C, and 60 cps at<br>
150°C.<br>
The chemical treatment was then transferred with its container to a bucket<br>
heater described in Process 2 above, and pumped to a suitable applicator. Glass fibers 12<br>
were attenuated and allowed to contact the applicator roll 28. The chemical treatment, at a<br>
temperature of about 115°C, was then transferred onto the glass fibers 12. The fibers 12<br>
were gathered at a conventional shoe 34 and wound onto a collet, making a square-edged<br>
package, and allowed to cool.<br><br>
The resulting package is stable and shippable, and the roving runs out well.<br>
The resulting composite strand 14 may be wire coated and chopped into pellets for eventual<br>
use in injection-molding applications.<br>
PBT-Based Chemical T-Based Chamical Treatment:<br>
An especially preferred PBT-based thermoplastic-type chemical treatment<br>
was prepared by depositing 17.28 kg of diglycidyl ether of 1,4-butanediol (HELOXY 67)<br>
into a five-gallon (19 L) metal can. To this was added 540 g of polyglycidyl ether of castor<br>
oil (HELOXY 505). To this mixture was added 180 g of A-l 100 (gamma-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysllane) as a coupling agent. The resulting chemical treatment<br>
contained, by weight, 96% HELOXY 67,3% HELOXY 505, and 1% A-l 100. This<br>
mixture was stirred until it became homogeneous. Then it was transferred with its<br>
container to a bucket heater, such as that of Process 1 (although it is not necessary to heat<br>
this chemical treatment to process it). For applying this chemical treatment, the applicator<br>
26 is raised to within 8-10 inches (20.32-25.4 cm) from the bushing 24.<br>
Polyester- or VinvlesteT-Based Chemical Treatment:<br>
An especially preferred polyester- or vinylestcr-based thermoset-type<br>
chemical treatments is prepared by depositing 6.75 kg of DER 337 epoxy (a bisphenol-A<br>
epoxy resin, available from Dow Chemical Company) into a five-gallon (19 L) metal can.<br>
This material is heated to 220°F (104°C) and stirred until all of the solids completely<br>
liquefy. To this liquid is added 6.75 kg of Araldite GT7013 epoxy (a bisphcnol A epoxy<br>
resin, available from Ciba Oeigy Corporation). The Araldite is added slowly with a great<br>
deal of agitation over a period of two hours. Upon complete dissolution of the Araldite<br>
epoxy, the mixture is allowed to cool in air to 200QF (93°C), and 0.76 kg of Pluronic L101<br>
(an ethylene oxide/propylcne oxide copolymer surfactant, available from BASF) and 2.21<br>
kg of Pluronic P105 (an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer surfactant, also<br>
available from BASF) are added. Also added at this time is 1 kg of PEG 400 MO<br>
(polyethylene glycol monooleate, available from Henkcl Corporation) and 0.5 kg of<br>
butoxyethylstearate (BES) (available from Stepan Company of Northfield, Illinois). The<br>
mixture is allowed to cool further with continued stirring to a temperature of 160- 170°F<br>
(71-77°C), at which point 2 kg of A-l 74 (gamma-metnacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
available from Witco Chemical Corporation) is added. Finally, 20 g of Uvitex OB (a<br>
fluorescent brightening agent available from Ciba-Geigy of Hawthorne, New York) is<br><br>
added to the mixture with agitation to facilitate good dispersion. The resulting chemical<br>
treatment contains, by weight;33.78% DER 337 epoxy, 33.78% Araldite GT7013 cpoxy,<br>
3.79% Pluronic L101,11.05% Pluronic P105,5% PEG 400 MO, 2.5% BES, 0.10% Uvitex<br>
OB, and 10% A-174. The chemical treatment is then transferred with its container to a<br>
bucket heater as described in Process 2.<br>
Epoxv-Bascd Chemical Treatment;<br>
The formulation for this example of a thermoset-type chemical treatment is<br>
as described above for polyester- and vinylestcr-based thermoset-type chemical treatments,<br>
except that A-187 (gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, available from Witco<br>
Chemical Company) is used in place of A-174.<br>
Two-Silane. Polyester- or Vinylestcr-Based Chemical Treatment:<br>
The formulation for this example of a thermoset-type treatment, which lias<br>
multi-compatibility (compatibility with polyester, vinylester or epoxy), is as described for<br>
the polyester- or vinylester-based thermoset-type chemical treatment described above,<br>
except that the silane coupling system consists of 1.25 kg (5% by weight) A-187 and 1.25<br>
kg (5% by weight) A-174, in place of the A-174 alone.<br>
In the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 3, matrix fibers 13 are preformed<br>
and then commingled with the reinforcing fibers 12 before being gathered into a composite<br>
strand 14. Alternatively, the matrix fibers 13 may be continuously formed in-line with the<br>
reinforcing fibers 12. The matrix fibers 13 ultimately form part or all of the matrix of a<br>
resulting composite article. The fibers 10 may comprise both continuously formed and<br>
preformed reinforcing fibers 12 or only preformed reinforcing fibers. If preformed<br>
reinforcing fibers 12 are used, they can be processed directly into a strand 14 containing<br>
only the preformed reinforcing fibers 12. Such preformed reinforcing fibers 12 can also be<br>
commingled with any other types of fibers in the same, or a similar, manner as the<br>
preformed matrix fibers 13 shown in Fig. 3. While only two spools or.packages of<br>
preformed fibers are shown, it is understood that any suitable number of packages of<br>
preformed fibers can be supplied in the illustrated manner or another suitable manner.<br>
The same applicator 26 can be used to chemically treat both the preformed<br>
fibers (e.g., the preformed matrix fibers indicated by the phantom lines 13') and the<br>
continuously formed fibers (e.g., the continuously formed reinforcing fibers 12) before the<br>
fibers are gathered into a strand 14. Alternatively, a separate applicator 26' can be used to<br><br>
chemically treat the preformed fibers (e.g., the preformed matrix fibers 13). If a separate<br>
applicator 26' is used, the gathering mechanism 34 may include a bar or roller 39 to help<br>
commingle the fibers 12 and 13 together before being gathered into a strand 14. Preformed<br>
fibers and continuously formed fibers may be chemically treated either together using the<br>
same applicator or separately using different applicators, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 08/527,601, filed September 13, 1995, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated by reference. Alternatively, some of the fibers 10, e.g., matrix fibers 13, may<br>
be gathered together with the coated fibers 32 without a chemical treatment first being<br>
applied.<br>
The applied chemical treatment may be heated before, during, and/or after<br>
the step of gathering the fibers. If it behaves as a thermoset, the applied chemical treatment<br>
can be partially or fully heat cured at some point during the formation of the composite<br>
strand 14. How much and when an applied thermosetting-type chemical treatment is heat-<br>
cured depend on the type of composite article being made from the strand 14. For example,<br>
a composite strand 14, with full, partial, or no heat-curing of the applied chemical<br>
treatment, can be chopped into a plurality of short discrete lengths, mixed into a molding<br>
compound, and injection molded into a composite article.<br>
For chopped lengths of strand 14, an applied chemical treatment is cured<br>
enough, if at all, to ensure that the short lengths of the composite strand 14 remain cohesive<br>
(i.e., that fibers 10 stay together) during subsequent processing. Where it behaves as a<br>
thermoset or is otherwise heat-curable, the applied chemical treatment on the coated fibers<br>
is preferably only partially cured during the forming of the composite strand 14. Curing of<br>
the applied chemical treatment is preferably completed in subsequent in-line or off-line<br>
processing (e.g., pultrusion, filament winding, transfer injection molding, compression<br>
molding, etc.) of the composite strand 14 into a composite article. A thermosetting-type<br>
chemical treatment preferably remains only partially cured until the forming of the<br>
composite article, because if the molecular weight of the chemical treatment approaches<br>
infinity (i.e., is maximized) during the forming of the composite strand 14, then the strand<br>
14 may not be further processable in downstream composite-forming applications. Such<br>
partial curing may be accomplished by choosing ingredients which will not fully react with<br>
one another under the conditions present during me composite strand-forming process. It<br>
may also be accomplished by choosing the relative amounts of the reactive ingredients of<br><br>
the chemical treatment so that at least one of the thermosetting constituents in the chemical<br>
treatment (e.g., a resin) remains only partially reacted or cured until the forming of the<br>
composite article (e.g., by controlling the stoichiometry of the chemical treatment). An<br>
exemplary chemical treatment having at least one reactive constituent that can remain only<br>
partially reacted or curjed during the strand-forming process comprises about 85% by<br>
weight PG-fumarate, about 10% by weight styrene, and about 5% by weight t-butylperoxy-<br>
benzoate.<br>
In the chemical treatments listed in Examples A-C above, there are several<br>
reactive species represented. While in most cases it is preferable for some unreacted<br>
chemical species to remain on the strand 14 at the end of the strand-forming process, it may<br>
be preferable in some cases, for example, in the above-listed chemical treatments that<br>
contain isocyanates or amic acids, for the chemical species to be fully reacted when in the<br>
strand form. With the isocyanates, if there is a diol present and in sufficient quantity (e.g.,<br>
about 20 times the number of isocyanate groups) and if the chemical treatment is applied at<br>
a high enough fiber surface temperature, the isocyanate groups will be fully reacted in the<br>
composite strand 14. Likewise, if the reaction conditions are right (e.g., high temperature<br>
and relatively low concentration), the amic acid in a chemical treatment will likely be<br>
completely converted to imide.<br>
A chemical treatment can be prepared that comprises about 45% by weight<br>
PG-tumarate, about 50% by weight styrene, and about 5% by weight t-butylpcroxy-<br>
benzoatc. This represents a polyester resin formulation that may be applied to glass fibers<br>
using applicator equipment as described above in Processes 1-3 and that may cure to a hard<br>
mass on a glass fiber strand 14 upon the addition of heat emanating from newly formed<br>
glass fibers. By removing about 90% of the styrene, this polyester resin chemical treatment<br>
may be rendered only partially curable when applied to the fibers. An additional chemical<br>
treatment can be prepared that comprises about 35% by weight of the. epoxy resin Epon<br>
828, available from Shell Chemical Company, about 35% by weight of the reactive epoxy<br>
modifier HELOXY 505, about 28% by weight maleic anhydride, and about 2% by weight<br>
Al 100. This epoxy resin formulation may be applied to glass fibers using any of the<br>
applicator equipment described above, and cures to a hard mass on a glass fiber strand 14<br>
upon the addition of heat emanating from newly formed glass fibers. By removing about<br><br>
90% to all of the maleic anhydride, this epoxy-resin chemical treatment may be rendered<br>
only partially curable when applied to the fibers.<br>
By raising the applicator 26 to a position closer to the heat emanating from<br>
the molten glass (e.g., bushing 24), the viscosity of a thermoplastic-type chemical treatment<br>
on the surface of the applicator roll 28 (Let* where the roll 28 comes in contact with the<br>
glass fibers 10) has been observed to drop, as well as that on the surface of the glass fibers<br>
12. A thermosetting-type chemical treatment which behaves like a thermoplastic at this<br>
stage of the process will also experience such a lowering of its viscosity. Gradients in the<br>
viscosity of the chemical treatment have been observed along the surface of the applicator<br>
roll 28. The viscosity has been found to be the lowest behind the fan of glass fibers 10, and<br>
appears to increase toward either end of the roller 28.<br>
For the Fig. 1 embodiment of apparatus 20, the applicator 26 is positioned<br>
adjacent or otherwise close enough to the bushing 24 that the chemical treatment is applied<br>
when the fibers 12 are at a high enough temperature (i.e., the fibers 12 emanate enough heat<br>
energy) to cause the desired drop in the viscosity and/or the desired degree of heat curing<br>
by crosslinking or otherwise increasing the molecular weight of the applied chemical<br>
treatment. At the same time, the applicator 26 is proforably positioned far enough away<br>
from the bushing 24 so that the chemical treatment is applied while the fibers 12 are at a<br>
temperature which will not cause significant damage to the chemical treatment (e.g.,<br>
decomposition of any organic chemicals or compounds). In this way, the resulting strand<br>
14 can be provided with the properties desired for subsequent processing into a composite<br>
article.<br>
Exemplary fiber temperatures for applying the chemical treatments are<br>
temperatures of up to about 350°C (662°F), with it possible to apply some treatments at<br>
even higher temperatures, without being significantly degraded or otherwise damaged.<br>
Fiber temperatures as low as about 150oC (302°F), or even lower, may be used. To protect<br>
the applied chemical treatment and cause at least one of the above two desired changes to<br>
occur in the applied chemical treatment, preferably the fibers 12 are at a temperature of<br>
from about 200°C (392°F) to about 300°C (572°F). Satisfactory results have been obtained<br>
when the viscosity of the chemical treatment of either type drops down to from about 200<br>
cps to about.400 cps at a temperature of from about 200°C to about 300°C.<br><br>
For glass reinforcing fibers 12 drawn from a conventional bushing 24 having<br>
a normal throughput, the applicator 28 is preferably disposed so that the-chemical treatment<br>
is applied to the glass fibers 12 at a minimum of at least about 3 inches (7.62 cm), and<br>
typically about 6 inches (15.24 cm), or more from the bushing 24 (i.e., from where the<br>
fibers 12 exit the bushing). The chemical treatment may be applied to the glass reinforcing<br>
fibers 12 at a distance of from about 8 inches to about 10 inches (20.32 cm to 25.4 cm)<br>
from the bushing 24. The exact location of the applicator 26 relative to the bushing 24<br>
depends, for example, on the type of bushing 24 used (e.g., the number of fibers being<br>
drawn from the bushing), the temperature of the molten glass material, the type of chemical<br>
treatment being applied, the desired properties of the interphase region around the<br>
reinforcing fibers 12, and the properties desired for the resulting strand 14 and ultimately<br>
for the composite article.<br>
Referring to the alternate embodiment depicted in Fig. 2, an apparatus 38<br>
includes the components of the previously described apparatus 20 and a heat retainer 40.<br>
Accordingly, components of apparatus 38 the same or similar to those of apparatus 20 have<br>
been designated with the same reference numerals. The heat retainer 40 is disposed,<br>
partially or completely, at least around the fibers 12 and is adapted using conventional<br>
techniques to maintain the heat energy emanating from the surface of the fibers 12 for a<br>
longer period of time and a farther distance from the fiber-forming mechanism 22.<br>
Satisfactory results have been obtained with a low-throughput glass fiber bushing 24 using<br>
an exemplary heat retainer 40 made from sheet metal formed into an open-ended<br>
rectangular box shape having a length of about 15 inches (38.1 cm), a width of about 3<br>
inches (7.62 cm), and a height of about 16 inches (40.64 cm). A low-tliroughput glass fiber<br>
bushing 24 typically forms glass reinforcing fibers 12 at a rate of less than or equal to about<br>
30-40 lbs./hr (13.62-18.16 kg/hr). The box-shaped heat retainer 40 is disposed between the<br>
fiber-forming mechanism 22 and the applicator 26 So that at least the fibers 12 are drawn<br>
through its open ends 42 and 44. Preferably the heat retainer 40 is sufficiently insulative to<br>
keep the surface of each fiber 12 at a temperature of from about 150°C (302°F) to about<br>
350°C (662°F) by the time the applicator 26 applies the chemical treatment to the fibers 12.<br>
The use of such a heat retainer 40 is particularly advantageous when a low-<br>
throughput continuous glass fiber forming bushing 24 is being used. The amount of heat<br>
energy being stored by the fibers 12 formed using a low-throughput bushing 24 is less than<br><br>
that stored by fibers 12 formed using a normal- or high-throughput bushing. Thus, the heat<br>
retainer 40 allows fibers 12 formed using a low-throughput bushing to be maintained at the<br>
temperature needed to cause the desired reaction (drop in viscosity and/or at least partial<br>
heat curing) in the applied chemical tmttnent. The heat retainer 40 may be modified to be<br>
disposed up to or even farther downline beyond the applicator 26 in order to maintain the<br>
fibers 12 at a desired elevated surface temperature at a point up to or downline from the<br>
applicator 26. For example, another heat retainer similar in structure to heat retainer 40<br>
could be disposed, partially or completely, around the coated fibers 32 and between the<br>
applicator 26 and the gathering mcchaniam 34. The use of such an additional heat retainer<br>
may be desirable when additional curing of the chemical treatment is needed before the<br>
strand 14 is collected, for example on a spool, or otherwise subsequently processed. An<br>
example of a means that may be useful as such a heat retainer in the present invention, in<br>
particular, after the chemical treatment is applied to the fibers, is described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,055,119, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The energy used in heating the applied chemical treatment can be at least<br>
partially, if not completely, provided by heat energy emanating from the coated fibers 32.<br>
For example, residual heat emanating from, or remaining in, the continuously formed glass<br>
fibers can provide a substantial amount of the heat energy. Residual heat emanating from<br>
continuously formed polymeric matrix fibers 13 may similarly be used to effect desired<br>
changes in an applied chemical treatment.<br>
If residual heat from the fiber-forming process is not available or is<br>
insufficient, such as when the fibers 10 are preformed, have cooled off, or otherwise are not<br>
at the desired temperature, the fibers 10 can be pre-heated to impart the heat energy desired<br>
for the applied the chemical treatment. Such pre-heating can be accomplished by the use of<br>
a conventional heating system. For example, referring to Fig. 2, a conventional open-ended<br>
furnace (not shown) can be used in place of the heat retainer 40 to pre-heat at least the<br>
fibers 12 to the desired temperature before the chemical treatment is applied.<br>
By using heat energy emanating from the fibers 32 to supply at least part of<br>
the necessary heat energy, the applied chemical treatment has its viscosity reduced and/or is<br>
at least partially heat-cured from the surface of the coated fibers 32 outwardly through at<br>
least part of the applied chemical treatment. Heating from the fiber surface outwardly is<br>
especially preferred and efficient way to heat the applied chemical treatment and to help<br><br>
optimize bonding between, the chemical treatment and the surface of the coated fibers 32.<br>
In addition, heating from the surface of the coated fibers 32 outwardly allows for greater<br>
versatility in engineering the interphase region formed by the applied chemical treatment,<br>
between each of the coated fibers 32 and the matrix material of the composite article.<br>
For example, heating an applied thermoplastic-type chemical treatment from<br>
the inside out helps to insure that its viscosity at the surface of the fibers will be low enough<br>
to obtain adequate wetting of the fiber surface. In addition, heating an applied heat-curable<br>
chemical treatment in this manner allows for the applied chemical treatment to be fully<br>
cured only at its interface with the fiber surface, thereby retaining an outer region of only<br>
partially cured or uncured chemical treatment, which can be fully cured when and where it<br>
is desired during subsequent processing. For instance, it may be desirable for this outer<br>
region to be partially cured or uncured to facilitate bonding between the chemical treatment<br>
and a subsequently applied matrix material or between the contacting layers of the applied<br>
chemical treatment on adjoining fibers.<br>
Preferably, heat emanating from the fibers 12 is used to heat the applied<br>
chemical treatment. Optionally, the energy used to heat the applied chemical treatment<br>
may be partially, substantially, or completely provided by heat energy emanating from a<br>
source external to the coated fibers. For example, after the chemical treatment is applied,<br>
the coated fibers 32 can be passed through a conventional open-ended furnace (not shown)<br>
either before, during, or after the coated fibers 32 are gathered into the strand 14. The<br>
applied treatment can also be heated externally during the forming of the strand 14 into a<br>
composite article. By heating it externally, the applied treatment has its viscosity reduced<br>
and/or is at least partially heat cured from its outer surface into the applied chemical<br>
treatment toward the surface of the coated fibers 32. Thus, it is also contemplated that the<br>
energy used to heat the applied chemical treatment may be provided by a combination of<br>
heat emanating from the coated fibers 32 and one or more external heat sources disposed so<br>
as to heat at least the reinforcing fibers 12 before and/or after the chemical treatment is<br>
applied.<br>
The chemical treatment may be kept cool before it is applied to the fibers 12<br>
to permit the use of very reactive ingredients and to help reduce the risk of heat-caused<br>
degradation of the chemical treatment. The temperature of the chemical treatment before<br>
being applied may be kept at less than or equal to about room temperature for the same<br><br>
means. For example, a cooling coil (not shown) can be submerged within the chemical<br>
treatment. When continuously formed glass fibers are being formed, the apparatus may<br>
also be adapted so as to surround the glass fibers 12 with an inert atmosphere before the<br>
chemical treatment is applied. The inert atmosphere should help prevent moisture from<br>
accumulating on the surface of the fibers 12, thereby inhibiting moisture-induced cracking<br>
and moisture-caused passivation of potential reactive species on the glass fiber surface. An<br>
inert atmosphere may not be desired when a high-output bushing is used or any other time<br>
the temperature of the glass fibers is sufficiently high. The glass fibers 12 can be<br>
surrounded with an inert atmosphere by using the heat retainer 40 (see Fig. 2) or similar<br>
structure to surround the glass fibers, with piping of the inert atmosphere into the heat<br>
retainer 40 as the fibers 12 pass therethrough. Suitable inert atmospheres include, for<br>
example, one or a combination of nitrogen and argon gases.<br>
An advantage of the inventive chemical treatments is that they may be<br>
processed using known fiber, strand, and composite-article forming equipment. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the solvent-free chemical treatments are advantageously employed<br>
in a wire-coating system described below.<br>
PREPARATION OF ENCASED STRANDS<br>
Another general aspect of the invention relates to a method and apparatus for<br>
making one or more plastic-encased composite strands that are moldable into a composite<br>
article having a polymeric or resinous matrix reinforced with fibers made from a suitable<br>
reinforcing material, such as a glass material, a synthetic or polymeric material, or another<br>
suitable non-glass material. The encased composite strands may be in thread form (i.e.,<br>
long lengths) or pellet form (i.e., short lengths).<br>
More particularly, each encased composite strand has a plurality of fibers,<br>
including at least reinforcing fibers and optionally fibers made of the thermoplastic matrix<br>
material to be used in the composite article. The fibers are processed into a strand or<br>
bundle, with each strand preferably containing from about 1,500 to about 10,000 fibers,<br>
more preferably from about 2000 to about 4,000 fibers. The strand is preimpregnated with<br>
a chemical treatment before the strand is formed.<br>
The preimpregnated composite strand is encased in a sheath of thermoplastic<br>
material. When the encased composite strand is to be formed into pellets, the chemical<br><br>
treatment is applied in a sufficient amount and between enough of the fibers to keep the<br>
fibers from falling out of the pallet When the encased composite strand is to be formed<br>
into thread, the chemical treatment is disposed between substantially all of the fibers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the chemical treatment is a thermoplastic-type<br>
polymeric material. Alternatively, the chemical treatment impregnating the composite<br>
strand may be a thermoset-typc polymeric material that is in a fully cured, partially cured,<br>
or uncured state. The strand of fibers optionally may be fully impregnated with an<br>
engineering thermoplastic matrix material, such as that used to encase or coat the composite<br>
strand. Although some engineering thermoplastic materials have relatively high melting<br>
points and high viscosities that can make it very difficult or impractical to apply the<br>
engineering thermoplastic to the fibers using conventional applicators, the artisan may<br>
appropriately modify such engineering thermoplastics for use as a chemical treatment in the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably, the sheath encasing the composite strand is made from the same<br>
thermoplastic material as that used to form the matrix of the composite article. The<br>
thermoplastic sheath material may form a portion or all of the matrix of the composite<br>
article, depending on the thickness of the sheath. Preferably the chemical treatment<br>
sufficiently bonds.or otherwise helps the sheath keep the fibers together in the<br>
preimpregnated strand, at least until the molding of the composite article. In addition, the<br>
chemical treatment is at least compatible with the thermoplastic matrix material of the<br>
composite article.<br>
According to a preferred process for making one or more of the<br>
thermoplastic-encased composite strands, a wire-coating or extrusion-coating process is<br>
used. The process comprises the steps of: providing a plurality of fibers comprising at<br>
least reinforcing fibers; applying a chemical treatment so as to coat substantially all of the<br>
fibers and thereby form preimpregnated fibers; gathering or otherwise combining the coated<br>
fibers together into at least one preimpregnated strand having the chemical treatment<br>
disposed between substantially all of the fibers forming the preimpregnated strand; coating<br>
at least the outside of the preimpregnated strand with a thermoplastic material to form at<br>
least one coated strand; and forming the coated strand into at least one wire-coated or<br>
otherwise, encased composite strand.<br><br>
The fibers can be provided using an in-line process that includes<br>
continuously forming the reinforcing fibers from a source of molten reinforcing material,<br>
such as glass. In addition to continuously formed reinforcing fibers, the fibers being<br>
provided may include preformed reinforcing fibers, preformed matrix fibers, continuously<br>
formed matrix fibers, or combinations thereof. When it is an aqueous system, the applied<br>
chemical treatment on the fibers is1 heated to evaporate a substantial amount of the moisture<br>
therein before the coated fibers are gathered together into a preimpregnated strand. When it<br>
is a thermoset-type, the chemical treatment is applied to the fibers either in an uncured or<br>
partially cured state. The uncured or partially cured chemical treatment that ends up<br>
impregnating the encased composite strand may be processed (e.g., by heating) to induce<br>
additional partial or full curing, depending on the desired condition of the encased<br>
composite strand during the molding of the composite article. In a preferred embodiment, a<br>
solvent-free chemical treatment as described above is used. Alternatively, a two-part non-<br>
aqueous chemical treatment may be used as set out in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
08/487,948, filed June 7,1995, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Exemplary systems for forming polymer-encased strands are illustrated in<br>
the drawings, particularly in Figs. 4-6. Fig. 4 shows one embodiment of an apparatus 110,<br>
including a source 112 of fibers 113, which in this embodiment consist of reinforcing fibers<br>
114, One exemplary source 112 is a conventional bushing 115 of molten reinforcing<br>
material (e.g., glass) from which the continuous reinforcing fibers 114 are drawn.<br>
An applicator 116 applies a chemical treatment onto substantially all of the<br>
fibers 114. In an exemplary embodiment, the chemical treatment being applied is aqueous,<br>
and the applicator 116 is a conventional type suitable for applying aqueous-based chemical<br>
treatments. The exemplary applicator 116 includes a rear-facing applicator roller 118,<br>
which applies the chemical treatment to the reinforcing fibers 114, thereby forming<br>
preimpregnated or coated fibers 120. The chemical treatment is applied as the fibers 114<br>
come in contact with the roller 118 when passing thereover. A trough 122 containing the<br>
chemical treatment is positioned below the roller 118. The roller 118 extends into the<br>
trough 122, and transfers the chemical treatment from the trough 122 to the fibers 114 as<br>
the roller 118 is rotated by a conventional drive device, such as a motor (not shown). Other<br>
suitable devices or techniques used for applying si2e or other chemical treatments may be<br><br>
used in place of the applicator roll assembly 116 to apply the chemical treatment to the<br>
reinforcing fibers 114.<br>
The aqueous-based chemical treatment applied on the preimpregnated or<br>
coated fibers 120 is heated to evaporate a substantial amount of the moisture therein, and<br>
then the coated fibers 120 are gathered together into a preimpregnated composite strand<br>
124. The moisture can be driven out of the applied aqueous-based chemical treatment<br>
using any suitable heating device 125. For example, the coated fibers 120 can be passed<br>
over and brought into contact with a heating device 125 substantially similar to either of the<br>
heating plates described in U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. 08/291,801, filed August<br>
17,1994, and 08/311,817, filed September 26,1994, the disclosures of which arc<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
A conventional gathering shoe or some other form of gatherer 127 can be<br>
used to gather together the dried fibers 120 into at least one preimpregnated strand 124.<br>
The preimpregnated strand 124 is coated or encased with a layer of polymer materia! and<br>
thereby formed into an encased composite strand 126 by pulling or otherwise passing the<br>
preimpregnated strand 124 through a wire coater 128. A wire coater is a device or devices<br>
capable of, or means for, coating one or more preimpregnated fiber strands with a polymer<br>
material so as to form a polymeric sheath on each preimpregnated strand 124. Preferably,<br>
each strand contains from about 1,500 to about 10,000 fibers, more preferably, from about<br>
2,000 to about 4,000 fibers.<br>
The fibers 113 used in forming an encased composite strand 126 can be<br>
made using an in-line process, like the one shown in Fig. 4, where reinforcing fibers 114<br>
are continuously drawn from a bushing 115 of molten reinforcing material, such as glass.<br>
In addition to or instead of continuously formed reinforcing fibers 114, the fibers 113 may<br>
comprise preformed reinforcing fibers. Also, the fibers 113 may include preformed matrix<br>
fibers, and even continuously formed matrix fibers; or combinations thereof. An exemplary<br>
system for applying an aqueous chemical treatment to continuous and preformed fibers to<br>
form a preimpregnated strand is disclosed in the above-incorporated U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 08/311,817.<br>
The matrix fibers ultimately form part or all of the matrix of the resulting<br>
composite article or product, such as pellets 132. Examples of suitable polymeric materials<br>
for the matrix fibers include polyesters, polyamides, polypropylenes, and polyphenylene<br><br>
sulfides. The continuous and preformed reinforcing fibers may be glass fibers, synthetic<br>
fibers, and/or any other suitable reinforcing fibers, e.g., fibers of traditional silicate glass,<br>
rock wool, slag wool, carbon, etc. When various fibers made from different materials are<br>
used, the same or a different chemical treatment may be used for each type of fiber.<br>
Preferably, the wire coater 128 includes a source of molten polymeric<br>
material, such as a conventional extruder, for providing the material used to encase the<br>
preimpreghated strand 124. The wire coater 128 also preferably includes a die or other<br>
suitable means having at4east one outlet or exit opening for shaping the sheath into a<br>
desired thickness and/or cross-section, preferably into a thickness and cross-section that are<br>
maintained relatively uniformly along its length. An exemplary wire coater 128 is<br>
manufactured by Killion of Cedar Grove, New Jersey, which includes a KN200 2-inch<br>
(5 cm) extruder equipped with a cross-head coating die. One or more encased composite<br>
strands 126 can be formed by pulling or otherwise passing one or more of the coated<br>
strands 124 through one or more such dies. The sheath material is preferably thermoplastic<br>
and may form a portion or all of the matrix of the composite article, e.g., depending on the<br>
thickness of the sheath. In a preferred embodiment, the sheath encasing the composite<br>
strand 124 is made from the same thermoplastic material as that used to form the matrix of<br>
the composite article.<br>
When it is desired for the encased composite strand 126 to be in short<br>
lengths, the apparatus 110 can include means such as a chopper 130 for cutting or otherwise<br>
separating the encased composite strand 126 into a plurality of encased composite pellets<br>
132. An exemplary chopper 130 is the model 204T Chopper manufactured by Conair-Jettro<br>
of Bay City, Michigan. When pellets 132 are being formed, the chemical treatment helps<br>
keep together the fibers 114 in each encased composite pellet 132 (helps keep a significant<br>
number of the fibers 114 from falling out of a pellet 132).<br>
The encased composite pellets preferably have lengths of from about 3/16<br>
inch (0.476 cm) to about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm), although they can be longer or shorter as<br>
appropriate. In an exemplary embodiment, the pellets have lengths of approximately 0.5<br>
inches (1.27 cm). Of course, the length of a pellet may vary from one application to<br>
another. Moreover, the form of the encased composite strand may vary to suit the particular<br>
application.<br><br>
which functions, e.g., to draw the reinforcing fibers 114 from the bushing 115 and pull the<br>
preimpregnated strand 124 through the wire coater 128. An exemplary puller 134 which<br>
has been used successfully in-line with the above-described Killion wire coater 128 is a<br>
4/24 High Speed Puller, also manufactured by Killion. Alternatively, the wire coater 128<br>
and/or the chopper 130 may be adapted to perform the function of the puller or to aid the<br>
puller in pulling the preimpregnated strand 124 through the wire coater 128.<br>
When it is desired for the encased composite strand product to be in thread<br>
form, the chopper 130 may be replaced by a winder device 136 for drawing the reinforcing<br>
fibers 114 from the bushing 115, pulling the preimpregnated strand 124 through the wire<br>
coater 128, and winding the encased composite strand 126 into a spool or other package<br>
138 of encased composite thread 140. When in thread form, the strand 124 is at least<br>
substantially, if not fully, impregnated with the applied chemical treatment. That is, the<br>
strand 24 is impregnated enough to produce satisfactory properties in the composite article<br>
formed thereby.<br>
Optionally, the winder device 136 may include a puller to help draw the<br>
fibers 114 and/or pull the strand 124. The exemplary winder device 136 illustrated in Fig. 5<br>
comprises a rotatable member or a collet 142, upon which is provided a removable large-<br>
diameter spool 144. The winder device 136 also includes a traversing mechanism 146 to<br>
distribute the continuous composite strand 126 along the length of the spool 144 to form a<br>
package 138. An air supply device (not shown) may be provided for supplying streams of<br>
air which impinge upon the strand 126 to cool it before winding.<br>
Exemplary winding means 136 which may be used in conjunction with an<br>
off-line wire coating operation combines a Hall Capstan Machine #634 (a puller) and a Hall<br>
Winder Machine #633, both of which are manufactured by Hall Industries of Branford,<br>
Connecticut. In such an off-line wire coating operation, the preimpregnated strand 124 is<br>
first formed andpackaged, then the packaged strand 124 is subsequently unwound off-line<br>
and pulled through the wire coater 128, and the resulting encased composite strand 126 is<br>
rewound into a package. If appropriate, the above-mentioned Hall wire-winding device can<br>
be adapted using techniques known in the wire- and cable-handling industry to handle the<br>
high processing speeds associated with an in-line wire coating process. For example, die<br><br>
spool 144 on which the encased composite thread 140 is wound can be made with a larger<br>
diameter.<br>
An exemplary setup procedure for the apparatus 110, and generally for a<br>
wire coater 128, includes threading or otherwise passing the free end of the preimpregnated<br>
strand 124 through the wire coater 128 and pulling enough of the strand 124 therethrough to<br>
allow the process to proceed on its own (e.g., to allow the strand to be pulled<br>
automatically). Such a setup procedure may include temporarily pulling a free end of the<br>
preimpregnated strand 124 (indicated by phantom line \2A% such as with a pair of<br>
conventional pull wheels 137 positioned apart from the wire coater 128, until a sufficient<br>
length of the preimpregnated strand 124 is available for passing through the wire coater<br>
128. This length of the preimpregnated strand 124 is then passed through the wire coater<br>
128 and pulled therethrough by the puller 134, chopper 130, winder 136, or a combination<br>
thereof. With the above-described wire coater 128 a feeder line is preferably used to thread<br>
the free end of the preimpregnated strand 124 through the wire coating die. Such a feeder<br>
line has an end capable of being secured to the free end of the strand 124. For example, a<br>
length of wire with a hook at one end can be used as the feeder line. The feeder line can be<br>
pre-positioned through the wire-coater die and the free end of the strand 124 doubled over,<br>
hooked by the feeder line, and then drawn through the wire coater 128. It is preferable to<br>
break-out (i.e., a strand of fibers breaking).<br>
Preferably, the die used in the wire coater 128 has an openablc or "clam-<br>
shell" configuration that allows the preimpregnated strand 124 to be laid into the die from<br>
one end to the other, rather than requiring threading longitudinally through the die. Such an<br>
openable die can eliminate the need for the above-described feeder line. An exemplary<br>
clam-shell die comprises two die halves which can be mated using guide posts or pins<br>
disposed through matching holes formed through opposing faces of the die halves.<br>
Alternatively, the two die halves can be hinged along adjoining edges and adapted to be<br>
fastened together along the opposite edges when the halves are hinged closed. The face of<br>
each die half defines half of the die cavity through which the preimpregnuted strand is<br>
pulled. With the die halves mated together, the die cavity has and entrance opening and an<br>
exit opening. It is preferable for the entrance to be oversized to minimize fiber abrasion and<br><br>
for the exit to be sized so as to define the desired final diameter, and sheath thickness, of the<br>
encased composite strand 126.<br>
With the die halves separated, the strand 124 can be quickly disposed<br>
between the die halves and the strand 124 trapped therebetween in the die cavity by closing<br>
the dio halves. A high-temperature gasket may be disposed between the opposing faces of<br>
the two die halves along the length of the die cavity. Each die half has one or more gates<br>
(i.e., through-holes) through which one or more streams of the molten thermoplastic<br>
encasing material, for example, from the extruder, are delivered into the die cavity so as to<br>
encase the preimpregnated strand 124 as it is pulled therethrough. Each die half can be<br>
adapted to accept a variety of inserts tailored widi different die cavities to vary the cross-<br>
sectional profile (e.g., round, rectangular, oval, irregular, etc.) of the encased strand 126.<br>
With such replaceable inserts, the same die can handle a variety of fiber diameters with less<br>
down-time caused by having to replace the entire die.<br>
Preferably, the chemical treatment is selected to bond or otherwise help die<br>
sheath keep the fibers 113 together in the encased composite strand 126, at least until the<br>
molding of the composite article. To help ensure that the composite article exhibits optimal<br>
mechanical properties between its reinforcing fibers and its matrix, the chemical treatment<br>
should be compatible with the thermoplastic matrix material of the composite article. A<br>
chemical treatment is considered compatible with the matrix material if it does not cause<br>
important properties, such as tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, or flexural<br>
modulus, of the resulting composite article to be inadequate. Such compatibility may be<br>
accomplished by formulating the chemical treatment so as to be capable of interacting with<br>
and/or reacting with the thermoplastic matrix material. The interaction and/or reaction<br>
between the chemical treatment (e.g., thermoplastic- or thermoset-type) and the matrix<br>
material may occur during the making of the encased composite strand, during the molding<br>
of the composite article, or during both processes.<br>
The chemical treatments may be miscible in me matrix material, in whole or<br>
in part, and/or may form a separate phase from the matrix material. Where a separate phase<br>
is formed, the chemical treatment disposed around each fiber may form a plurality of<br>
separate phase regions dispersed in the matrix material and/or a single separate phase region<br>
surrounding its corresponding fiber. A chemical treatment, such as one of those discussed<br>
below, may be selected to enhance the properties of the composite article.<br><br>
Aqueous Chemical Treatments<br>
The aqueous chemical treatment applied, e.g., using the apparatus 110, may<br>
comprise one or more polymeric film formers in the form of a solid powder or other<br>
particles dispersed in a water medium. The particulate Him former may be a thermoplastic-<br>
type polymer, a thermoset-type polymer, or a combination of both. Low and/or high<br>
molecular weight solid thermoplastic and thermoset polymers may be used to form a<br>
particulate film former. The aqueous chemical treatment may also include one or more<br>
binders dispersed in the water medium along with the particles of me film former. The<br>
binder may include a thermoplastic and/or thermoset liquid, low melting point<br>
thermoplastic particles, or a combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, the binder prevents the solid particles of the film former from<br>
falling out of the encased composite strand, as well as prevents the fibers from falling out of<br>
the composite strand, even when the strand is in the form of a pellet. To accomplish this,<br>
the thermoplastic binder particles are at least partially molten or fusible by the heat energy<br>
used to evaporate the water out of the chemical treatment. In addition, the liquid binder has<br>
the necessary degree of tackiness or adhesiveness to sufficiently maintain the cohesiveness<br>
of the film former particles and the fibers. Preferably, a higher melting point thermoplastic<br>
film former powder is modified or combined with a lower melting point thermoplastic<br>
binder powder, such as particles of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), aqueous urethane, etc.<br>
The aqueous chemical treatment may also contain a liquid film former<br>
dispersed in the water medium (e.g., as an emulsion). The liquid film former may comprise<br>
one or more low molecular weight thermoplastic polymers, one or more thermoset<br>
polymers, or a combination thereof. Preferably, with an aqueous chemical treatment<br>
emulsion, a liquid film former also functions as the binder. The aqueous chemical<br>
treatment may also be a combination of a liquid-solid dispersion and a liquid-liquid<br>
emulsion.<br>
The thermoset-type film formers and binders used in the aqueous chemical<br>
treatments are preferably applied to the fibers in an uncured state, although they may also<br>
be applied in a partially cured state. The amount of set or cure of a thermoset-type<br>
chemical treatment may be controlled by choosing a thermosetting material, with an<br>
appropriate curing temperature, that will cure to the degree desired at the temperatures seen<br>
during processing according to the present invention. The uncured or partially cured<br><br>
thennoset-typc chemical treatment impregnating the encased composite strand may be<br>
processed (e.g., by heating) to induce additional curing or full curing, depending on the<br>
desired condition of the encased composite strand during the chopping operation, the<br>
winding operation, or the molding of the composite article. The degree to which an applied<br>
thermoset-type chemical treatment is cured, regardless of whether it is aqueous or not, may<br>
be controlled by using a heating device (e.g., heater 125).<br>
Therefore, the thermoset-type chemical treatment may be tailored to allow<br>
only enough curing, if any, to maintain the cohesivencss and/or degree of impregnation of<br>
the encased composite strand until the molding of the composite article. The individual<br>
fibers forming the strand do not have to separate in the thermoplastic matrix material to<br>
form a desired composite article. The thermoset-type chemical treatment may then be<br>
adapted to fully cure so that the fibers essentially remain permanently together, even during<br>
the molding of the composite article.<br>
The aqueous solution treatment contains an amount of one or more chemical<br>
treatment polymers or other organic compounds or materials (e.g., film formers, binders) to<br>
sufficiently preimpregnate the fibers. For example, the aqueous chemical treatment<br>
contains enough of the film former and, if present, binder polymers to impregnate the fibers<br>
to the degree desired. It is preferable for the aqueous chemical treatment to contain one or<br>
more film formers, binder polymers, and/or other organic material in sufficient<br>
concentrations to provide the preimpregnated strand with an organic material content of up<br>
to about 25% by weight, more preferably of up to about 15% by weight, and even more<br>
preferably of approximately 6-7% by weight, based on the total weight of the chemical<br>
treatment plus fibers, after the desired amount of moisture has been removed from the<br>
applied chemical treatment. This degree of organic material loading may also be useful for<br>
non-aqueous chemical treatments discussed herein. A loss on ignition (LOI) method can be<br>
used to determine the amount of applied chemical treatment loaded onto the fibers.<br>
Satisfactory results have been obtained with a chemical treatment solution having an<br>
organic material content of about 30% by weight. Such an organic material concentration<br>
attains strands preimpregnated with 5-15% by weight of die organic compounds present in<br>
the chemical treatment.<br>
A suitable organic material concentration of the aqueous chemical treatment<br>
can generally be selected independently of the form of the chemical treatment (i.e.,<br><br>
dispersion, emulsion, or the like). In addition, the concentration of organic materials in the<br>
preimpregnated strand, for a given concentration, can vary depending on a number of<br>
factors, such as how fast the fibers are moving, the temperature of the heating device, the<br>
temperature of the chemical treatment when applied, the tendency of the chemical treatment<br>
to remain impregnated in the strand (e.g., its viscosity), the speed (rpm's) of the applicator<br>
roller, and whether prepad water sprays are used.<br>
The following are specific examples of aqueous chemical treatments which<br>
may be applied, e.g., using the apparatus 110, to preimpregnate fibers.<br>
Example I<br>
Six thousand grams (6000 g) of chemical treatment was formed by the<br>
following procedure. Fifteen g (0.25 % weight percent as received) of amine silane<br>
coupling agent A-1100 was added to 2345 g of deionized water. This was stirred for<br>
several minutes. Then 1875 g (31.25%) of film former Covinax 201 and 1500 g (25.0%) of<br>
film former Covinax 225 were combined in a two-gallon pail. The silane solution was then<br>
mixed with the mixture of film formers using moderate agitation. Next, 480 g (fi.0%) of<br>
Maldene 286 was added to the mixture of silane and film formers. Finally, 200 g (3.3%) of<br>
BES homogenate (the fatty acid ester KESSCO BES that has been emulsified into a<br>
homogenate) was added under continuous stirring. The organic compound concentration of<br>
the resulting chemical treatment solution was 30% by weight The resulting chemical<br>
treatment is appropriate for applying to polyamide fibers as well as glass fibers.<br>
Example II<br>
Six thousand grams (6000 g) of chemical treatment was formed as follows.<br>
Fifteen g (0.25%) of A-l 100 silane was added to 1870 g of deionized water. This was<br>
stirred for several minutes. Then 3450 g (57.5%) of film former Synthemul 97903-00 was<br>
poured into a two-gallon pail (7.6 L). The silane solution was then mixed with the film<br>
former using moderate agitation. Next, 480 g (8.0%) of Maldene 286 was added to the<br>
mixture of silane and film former. Finally, 200 g (3.3%) of BES homogenate was added<br>
under continuous stirring. The organic compound concentration of the resulting chemical<br>
treatment solution was 30%. The resulting chemical treatment is suitable for applying to<br>
polyamide fibers as well as glass fibers.<br><br>
Six thousand grams (6000 g) of chemical treatment was formed by the<br>
following procedure. Fifteen g (0.25%) of A-l 100 was added to 2325 g of deionized water.<br>
This was allowed to stir for several minutes. Then 1875 g (31.25%) of Covinax 201 and<br>
1500 g (25.0%) of Covinax 225 were combined in a two-gallon pail (7.6 L). The silane<br>
solution was then mixed with the mixture of Covinax film formers using moderate<br>
agitation. A terephthalic acid solution was prepared by dissolving 30 g (0.5%) of<br>
terephthalic acid in 30 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The terephthalic acid<br>
solution was added to the mixture of silane and film formers. Then, 300 g (5.0%) of<br>
Polyemulsion 43N40 was added to the mixture. Finally, 200 g (3.3%) of BES homogenate<br>
was added under continuous stirring. The organic compound concentration of the resulting<br>
chemical treatment solution was 30%. The resulting chemical treatment is suitable for<br>
applying to polypropylene libers as well as glass fibers.<br>
Example IV<br>
Six thousand grams (6000 g) of chemical treatment was formed by the<br>
following procedure. Fifteen g (0.25%) of A-l 100 (silane) was added to 2020 g of<br>
deionized water. This was stirred for several minutes. Next, 3450 g (57.5%) of Synthemul<br>
97903-00 (film former) was poured into a two-gallon pail (7.6 L). The silane solution was<br>
then mixed with the film former using moderate agitation. A terephthalic acid solution was<br>
prepared by dissolving 30 g (0.5%) of terephthalic acid in 30 ml of concentrated<br>
ammonium hydroxide. The terephthalic acid solution was added to the mixture of silane<br>
and film former. Then, 300 g (5.0%) of Polyemulsion 43N40 was added to the mixture.<br>
Finally, 200 g (3.3%) of BES homogenate was added under continuous stirring. The<br>
organic compound concentration of the resulting chemical treatment solution was 30%.<br>
The resulting chemical treatment may be applied to polypropylene fibers as well as glass<br>
fibers.<br>
Example V<br>
Six thousand grams (6000 g) of chemical treatment was formed by the<br>
following procedure. Fifteen g (0.25%) of A-l 100 was added to 1870 g of deionized water.<br>
This was stirred for several minutes. Next, 3450 g (57.5%) of Synthemul 97903-00 was<br>
poured into a two-gallon pail (7.6 L). The silane solution was then mixed with the film<br>
former using moderate agitation. Finally, 200 g (3.3%) of BES homogenate was added<br>
under continuous stirring. The organic compound concentration of the resulting chemical<br><br>
treatment solution was 30%. The resulting chemical treatment may be applied to fibers<br>
made from a wide variety of materials, including polyphenylene sulfide and inorganic<br>
fibers.<br>
Example VI<br>

name K12. Polyemulsion 43N40 is a maleic anhydride modified polypropylene wax<br>
dispersed in water, which is commercially available from the Chemical Corporation of<br>
America, of East Rutherford, New Jersey. Polyemulsion 43N40 functions as an interphase<br>
modifier to improve the interphase region (adhesion) between glass fibers and a<br>
polypropylene matrix material by chemically reacting with the coupling agent. The<br>
terephthalic acid is commercially available from the Aldrich Chemical Company of<br>
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and also functions as an interphase modifier to improve adhesion<br>
between glass and the polypropylene matrix material by inducing the polypropylene to<br>
crystallize close to the glass surface. Maidenc 286 is a partial ammonium salt of butadiene-<br><br>
maleic acid copolymer commercially available from Lindau Chemical Inc., of Columbia,<br>
South Carolina. Maldene 286 functions as an interphase modifier to improve adhesion<br>
between glass fibers and nylon matrix material.<br>
Solvent-Free Chemical Treatments<br>
Solvent-free chemical treatments, such as those described above, may also<br>
be used to prepare encased strands. The use of such chemical treatments has advantages,<br>
e.g., no substantial amounts of water vapor, volatile organic carbon, or other solvent vapor<br>
are generated when processed (e.g., heated) according to the above-described wire-coating<br>
method, including during the molding of the composite article. By being substantially<br>
solvent-free, the chemical treatment may have its viscosity reduced and/or be heat-cured<br>
without experiencing a substantial drop in mass, thereby allowing for most of the chemical<br>
treatment that is applied to the fibers to remain on the fibers. Such chemical treatment is<br>
preferably also substantially non-photosetting.<br>
Illustrated in Fig. 6 is an embodiment of an apparatus 150 which is capable<br>
of making one or more polymer-encased composite strands 126 using solvent-free chemical<br>
treatments. The resulting encased composite strands 126, which may be formed into pellets<br>
or threads, are also suitable for molding into a fiber-reinforced composite articles.<br>
Structural elements and components of the apparatus 150 which are identical or similar to<br>
those of the previously described apparatus 110 are indicated by the same reference<br>
numerals used above. The exemplary apparatus 150 includes an applicator 116 having a<br>
front-facing applicator roller 118 which applies the chemical treatment to the reinforcing<br>
fibers 114, thereby forming coated fibers 120. A conventional dual-roller applicator may<br>
also be used in place of the single-roller 118.<br>
When it is desired for the applied chemical treatment on the fibers to be<br>
heated before the gathering of the fibers 113, an exemplary apparatus 150 has applicator<br>
116 positioned adjacent to the underside of the bushing 115. The applicator 116 is<br>
positioned such that the chemical treatment is applied when the fibers 114 are at a high<br>
enough temperature (e.g., the fibers 114 emanate enough heat energy) to cause the desired<br>
drop in viscosity and/or a desired degree of heat-curing (crosslinking or otherwise<br>
increasing the molecular weight) of the applied chemical treatment, depending on the type<br>
being applied. At the same time, the applicator 116 is positioned far enough away from the<br>
bushing 115 so that the chemical treatment is applied while the fibers 114 are at a<br><br>
temperature which will not cause significant damage to the chemical treatment (e.g.,<br>
decomposition of any organic chemicals or compounds). In this way, the resulting strand<br>
126 can be provided with the properties desired for subsequent processing into a composite<br>
article.<br>
For glass reinforcing fibers 114 drawn from a conventional bushing 115<br>
having a normal throughput, the applicator 116 is preferably disposed so that the chemical<br>
treatment is applied to the glass fibers 114 at a minimum of about 3 inches (7.62 cm),<br>
preferably, about 6 inches (15.24 cm), from the bushing 115 (from where the fibers exit the<br>
bushing). Satisfactory results may be obtained when the chemical treatment is applied to<br>
the glass reinforcing fibers 114 in the range from about 8 inches to about 10 inches (20.32<br>
cm to 25.4 cm) from the bushing 115. The optimal location of the applicator 116 relative to<br>
the bushing 115 depends, for example, on the type of bushing used (e.g., the number of<br>
fibers being drawn from the bushing 115), the temperature of the molten glass material, the<br>
type of chemical treatment being applied, the desired properties of the interphase region<br>
around at least the reinforcing fibers 14 and the properties desired for the resulting strand<br>
124 and the ultimate composite article.<br>
It may be desirable for the chemical treatment to be kept cool before it is<br>
applied to the fibers 14 to allow very reactive ingredients to be used in the chemical<br>
treatment and to help reduce the risk of heat-caused degradation of the chemical treatment.<br>
It may also be desirable for the temperature of the chemical treatment, before it is applied,<br>
to be kept at less than or equal to about room temperature for the same reasons. The<br>
chemical treatment can be kept at the desired temperature by suitable means. For example,<br>
a cooling coil may be submerged within the chemical treatment. When continuously<br>
formed glass fibers are being formed, it may also be desirable for the apparatus to be<br>
adapted so as to surround the glass fibers 114 with an inert atmosphere before the chemical<br>
treatment is applied. The inert atmosphere should help prevent moisture from accumulating<br>
on the surface of the fibers 114, thereby inhibiting moisture-induced cracking and moisture-<br>
caused passivation of potential reactive species on the fiber surface, as discussed above. An<br>
inert atmosphere is preferably not employed, however, when a high-output bushing is used<br>
or any other time the temperature of the glass fibers is sufficiently high.<br>
As with the aqueous-based system depicted in Fig. 4, the fibers 113 being<br>
coated with the solvent-free chemical treatment may include fibers other than the<br><br>
continuously drawn reinforcing fibers 114. The fibers 113 may include preformed<br>
reinforcing and/or matrix fibers 152. As shown in Fig. 6, the preformed fibers 152 are<br>
pulled from spools or other packages and then commingled with the continuously formed<br>
reinforcing fibers 114 before all the fibers 113 are gathered into a composite strand 124.<br>
The fibers 113 may also include matrix fibers that are continuously produced, for example,<br>
from a bushing or spinner, and commingled in-line with the reinforcing fibers 114. Before<br>
being commingled, the preformed fibers 152 may be coated with the same or a different<br>
chemical treatment than that applied to the reinforcing fibers 114. Depending on the type<br>
of fibers 152, a chemical treatment may not be applied to the fibers 152 before the fibers<br>
113 are commingled. The same techniques and equipment may be used to chemically treat<br>
each type of reinforcing fiber and matrix fiber, whether they are continuously formed or<br>
preformed.<br>
The same applicator 116 can be used to chemically treat both the preformed<br>
fibers 152 and the continuously formed fibers 114 before the fibers 113 are gathered into a<br>
strand 124. Alternatively, a separate applicator 116' can be used to chemically treat the<br>
preformed fibers 152 (as indicated by phantom lines 152'). If a separate applicator 116' is<br>
used, the gathering mechanism 127 may include a bar or roller 154 to help commingle the<br>
fibers 114 and 152 together before being gathered into the strand 124. The above-<br>
incorporated U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/527,601 describes other methods, and<br>
apparatus for chemically treating preformed fibers and continuously formed fibers together<br>
using the same applicator or separately using different applicators. Alternatively, some of<br>
the fibers 113, such as matrix fibers 152, may be gathered with the coated fibers 120<br>
without a chemical treatment first being applied.<br>
A composite article may then be made using conventional techniques, such<br>
as by molding one or more encased composite strands 126, in the form of pellets 132,<br>
threads 140, or both. The resulting composite article may be formed by using injection<br>
molding, compression molding, transfer molding, or any other suitable molding technique.<br>
The encased composite threads 140 may be formed into a fabric, for example, by an<br>
intennediate weaving or knitting process, and then compression- or transfer-molded into the<br>
desired composite article. An example of such a fabric-forming method and apparatus is<br>
described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/527,601, filed September 13, 1995, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
