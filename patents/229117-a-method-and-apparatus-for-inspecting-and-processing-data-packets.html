INTELLIGENT INTEGRATED NETWORK SECURITY DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling computer network security.<br>
Firewalls and intrusion detection systems are devices that are used to protect a computer network from unauthorized or disruptive users. A firewall can be used to secure a local area network from users outside the local area network. A firewall checks, routes, and frequently labels all messages sent to or from users outside the local area network. An intrusion detection system (IDS) can be used to examine information being communicated within a network to recognize suspicious patterns of behavior. Information obtained by the IDS can be used to block unauthorized or disruptive users from accessing the network. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an in-line version of an IDS. An IPS can be used to examine information as it is being communicated within a network to recognize suspicious patterns of behavior.<br>
A flow-based router (FBR) can allow network administrators to implement packet forwarding and routing according to network policies defined by a network administrator. FBRs can allow network administrators to implement policies that selectively cause packets to be routed through specific paths in the network. FBRs can also be used to ensure that certain types of packets receive differentiated, preferential service as they are routed. Conventional routers can forward packets to their destination address based on available routing information. Instead of routing solely based on the destination address, FBRs can enable a network administrator to implement routing policies to allow or deny packets based on several other criteria including the application, the protocol, the packet size and the identity of the end system.<br>
A packet filter can operate on the data in the network layer, to defend a trusted network from attack by an untrusted network. Packet filters can operate at the network layer to inspect fields of the TCP/IP header including, the protocol type, the source and destination P address, and the source and destination port numbers. Disadvantages of packet filters include, speed (i.e., slow) and management in large networks with complex security policies. Packet filters alone may not provide robust protection because packet filters are not aware of the context of the given communication. In addition, packet filters do not inspect the data at the application layer making packet filters vulnerable to attempted security intrusions using the application layer.<br><br>
A proxy server can operate on values carried in the application layer to insulate a trusted network from an untrusted network. In an application proxy server, two TOP connections are established: one between the packet source and the proxy server, another between the proxy server and the packet destination. The application proxy server can receive the arriving packets on behalf of the destination server. The application data can be assembled and examined by the proxy server, and a second TCP connection can be opened between the proxy server and the destination server to relay permitted packets to the destination server. Proxy servers can be slow because of the additional protocol stack overhead required to inspect packets at the application layer. Furthermore, because a unique proxy can be required for each application, proxy servers can be complex to implement and difficult to modify for supporting new applications. In addition, because proxy servers only examine application packets proxy servers may not detect an attempted network security intrusion at the TCP or network layers.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides methods and apparatus, including computer program products, for processing data packets and for implementing computer network security.<br>
Advantages of the invention may include one or more of the following features. The technique disclosed can be used to detect an attempted network security intrusion and potentially block the current packet associated with the security intrusion. The disclosed technique can provide robust and efficient network security and includes plural security devices but only one flow table. Network security information is obtained from other network security devices and stored in a single flow record in the flow table. The use of a single flow record to determine whether a packet should be allowed can result in faster response time.<br>
The details of one or more implementations of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG 1 shows a network topology including a local area network (LAN) (100), including a server (102), several workstations (W/S) (104), and a security device 124. The security system 124 can include a session module 122 and a plurality of other security devices. In the implementation shown, the security system 124 includes two security devices, a first security device 106 and a second security device 108. The LAN 100 is connected to an external network e.g., the Internet (114), through the security system 124. The LAN 100 is also connected to a second LAN (116) through a router (118), and satellite (120). Second LAN 116 includes a web server (110), an email server (112), a server 102, several workstations 104 and a security system 124. The computers, servers and other devices in the LAN are interconnected using a number of data transmission media such as wire, fiber optics, and radio waves. The session module 122 monitors packets being communicated within the network. In one implementation, the first security device 106 can be a firewall and the second security device 108 can be an IPS. The session module 122 can act in conjunction with the first security device 106 and the second security device 108 to facilitate the blocking of packets associated with an attempted network security intrusion.<br>
FIG 2 shows a block diagram of a session module 122. The session module 122 includes an incoming packet interface 205 for receiving packets. The received packets are analyzed by a flow processing engine (FPE) 202 to determine if an attempted network security intrusion is in progress. The session module 122 also includes a flow table 215. The flow table 215 is used to store information regarding flows associated with received<br><br>
packets. The session module 122 also includes interfaces to other security devices on the network. In one implementation, the session module 122 includes a firewall interface 220, an IPS interface 225, and a flow router interface 230. The security device interfaces 220 are used by the session module to obtain infonnation regarding the received packet, and information regarding the flow associated with the packet, in order to determine if the received packet should be allowed or modified. The security device interfaces 218 are also used by the session module 122 to communicate flow information required by the security devices to facilitate processing of the packet.<br>
FIG 3 illustrates a structure of a flow table 300. The flow table 300 includes flow records 302 associated with current TCP/IP flows. A TCP/IP flow includes a sequence of data packets communicating information between a source and a destination in one direction- The flow records are indexed using an indexing key 305. The indexing key 305 is used to store and retrieve the appropriate flow record associated with a received packet. In one implementation, the indexing key 305 can be a hash key and the flow table 300 can be implemented as a hash table. The session module 122 (FIG 2) stores instructions for two or more security devices on the network in the same flow record. In one implementation of the session module 122, instructions for three security devices (i.e. devices 310, 315, and 320) are stored in the flow record 302, The flow record 302 can store policy information (firewall policy, PS policy etc., to apply to the flow) as well as other information that is used by the security devices such as encryption parameters, address translation parameters, bookkeeping information, and statistics. The flow record 302 can also include flow information 325 required by the session module 122 in order to decide whether the packet should be allowed. Such information can include information required to implement network policies regarding, for example connection time out, time billing, and bandwidth usage. Flows, sessions and flow tables are described in greater detail in co-pending and commonly owned patent application entitled "Multi-Method Gateway-Based Network Security Systems and Methods," and assigned serial number 10/072,683, the contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIG 4 is a flow diagram describing the operation of the FPE 202 (FIG 2). Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 4, incoming packets are received by the session module (step 400).  IP packets are de-fragmented (step 402) and the IP header is validated for each IP packet (step 403).   In the validation step, the IP header associated with a given packet is extracted and the extracted IP header is inspected for fundamental flaws. Thereafter FPE 202 determines if the session is to be allowed (step 415).<br><br>
If the packet is a TCP packet (step 404), the TCP header is validated (step 405) and the TCP packets are reassembled (step 410). The validation process includes extracting TCP header data and evaluating the header for fundamental flaws. The quasi-reassembly information developed in step 410 can be communicated by the session module 122 to other security devices to facilitate processing of the packet by the other security devices. Reassembly is described in greater detail below and in "Multi-Method Gateway-Based Network Security Systems and Methods."<br>
In step 415, FPE 202 performs session classification using the TCP/IP header data associated with a given received packet The session module 122 can determine if the packet should be allowed based on information obtained regarding the TCP/IP flow associated with the received packet and retrieved from the flow table 420. In addition, the session module 122 can use information returned from one of the other security devices e.g., the firewall 425, the PS 430, and the flow based router 435. Further, the session module 122 can also facilitate the operation of the security devices by communicating flow information to a respective device as required by the device to process a given packet. Finally, FPE 202 forwards the packet if the packet should be allowed (step 440).  Otherwise, the packet is otherwise processed at step 445. Other processing can include logging particular information regarding the packet, holding the packet, modifying and/or dropping the packet This completes the description of the operation of FPE 202.<br>
FIG 5 is a flow diagram showing the steps included in session classification (step 415). The session classification step receives a packet (step 500) and extracts infoimation required to determine whether the packet should be allowed. The extracted information can include the source and destination IP addresses, the source and destination port numbers, and the protocol (step 505). The extracted information can be used to search the flow table (step 510) in order to determine if the packet is associated with a known session flow. For a known session flow, step 510 will produce a matching flow record in the flow table (step 515). If a matching flow record is found, the FPE 202 (FIG 2) can extract TCP/IP session information for the received packet (step 520) from the matching flow record. The FPE 202 determines if the received packet should be allowed using the TCP/IP session information obtained during step 520, More specifically, the FPE 202 extracts information from the matching flow record, and passes the information to the security devices (e.g., communicating the session ID and the TCP/IP session information other security device specific information from the flow record) (step 525).<br><br>
Depending on the returned results from the security devices, the FPE 202 can forward, drop, log, store, modify or otherwise process the given packet (step 530).<br>
If a matching flow record is not found in the flow table during step 515, the received packet can be associated with a new TCP/IP session (step 532). For a new TCP/IP session, the FPE 202 can assign a session ID to the new session and the FPE 202 can communicate with the other security devices (e.g. firewall, IPS, flow router) to determine a security policy for packets associated with the new session. For example, the FPE 202 can obtain information from the firewall 540 in order to determine if received packets associated with the new session should be allowed. The FPE 202 can communicate with the PS 545 in order to determine if the received packet should be blocked because it matches known attack signatures for attempted network security intrusions. The FPE 202 can obtain any network policy associated with the new session from the flow router 550. The FPE 202 can act as an arbiter between the different security devices and use the information obtained from the security devices either individually or in combination to determine if the packets associated with the new TCP/IP session should be allowed. The FPE 202 can use the information obtained from the security devices to create a new flow record and store the new flow record in the flow table (step 555). The new flow record includes the TCP/IP session information for the new session associated with the received packet and any other specific security device information. Thereafter, the FPE 202 can facilitate the processing of received packets associated with a given TCP/IP session as described above in association with FIG 4 including communicating the session ID,TCP/IP session information and security device specific information to the security devices from a corresponding flow record.<br>
In addition to determining if a received packet is associated with an attempted network security intrusion using the varied security devices, the session module can also perform quasi-reassembly of the received TCP/IP packets as described above in association with FIG 4. FIG 6 shows the quasi-reassembly information that can be generated by the session module. The quasi-reassembly information can include a pointer to a location of a given packet 600 in memory and a pointer to information containing the relative position of the packet in a flow 605. In one implementation, an IPS can perform passive TCP/IP reassembly and the pointer to the location of the packet can be used to locate the packet within the IPS. In another implementation, the pointer to information containing the relative position of the packet in the flow can be used to obtain the TCP/IP number included in the TCP/IP header associated with the packet. The quasi-<br><br>
reassembly information can be communicated to the security devices connected to the session module 122 (FIG 2) as required. The security devices can use the quasi-reassembly information to process the received packet<br>
The session module can be used in a number of different network topologies. FIG 7 shows a network topology where a session module 710 is integrated into a firewall 705. The firewall 705 can include an interface to a router 720 and an IPS 715. The firewall 705 receives packets from the external network interface 700. The firewall 705 communicates with the IPS 715 to determine whether the received packet should be blocked based on known attack signatures. If the firewall 705 and IPS 715 determine that the packet should be allowed to pass, the firewall 705 sends the received packet to the router 720. The router 720 forwards the outgoing packet to its intended destination, using the internal network interface 725, based on the network policies stored in the router.<br>
FIG 8 shows an alternate arrangement for implementing computer network security using a session module. In this arrangement, the session module 820 operates in series with a firewall 805, an IPS 810, and a router 815. Packets received using the external network interface 800 are screened by the firewall 805 before being communicated to the router 815. The firewall 805 also sends information regarding the received packet to the IPS 810. The IPS 810 examines the received packet and informs the session module 820 if the received packet should be blocked based on known attack signatures. The router 815 sends the packet to the session module 820 for further processing.   If the session module 820 determines that the received packet should be allowed it forwards the received packet to its intended destination using the internal network interface 825.<br>
