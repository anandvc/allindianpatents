The invention relates to crystalline cephem acid addition salts which are distinguisnea by particularly low solubility, processes for Their preparation and their use as pharmaceuticals.<br><br>
German Patent Applications DE 3 248 281 (US 4 609 653) (for n = !) and DE 3 706 020 (US 4 845 087) (for n = 2) propose crystallized acid addition salts of the formula A which are used for the treatmenl of bacterial infections. Their active compound levels in the plasma, however, are not adequately long, in particular for use in the veterinary sector.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to find salts having a half-life which is distinctly prolonged in comparison with the known salts and thus longer active compound levels in the plasma and dssues. This object is surprisingly achieved by salts of the formula 1<br><br><br><br><br>
where R and R' Independently of one another are hydrogen, carboxyl, hydroxyl, halogen, a straight-chain or branched saturated or unsaturated aliphatic C1-C5-alkyl radical or C1-C5-alkoxy radical and where X can also be X/2 in the case of a diprotic acid.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula I contain the carboxylic acids of the formulae II-V, in which R and R' are hydrogen, carboxyl, hydroxyl, methyl or methoxy and in which in is 0.5 - 2.<br>
The following acids,  for example,  are particularly<br>
preferred:<br>
dlhydroxybenzolc acids, such as 2,4-, 2,5- or 3,5-di-<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid,<br>
trihydroxybenzoic acids, such as gallic acid,<br>
hydroxydicarboxylic acids, such as 4-hydroxyisophthalic<br>
acid,<br>
hydroxynaphthalenecarboxylic acids, such as 2-hydroxy-<br>
naphthalene-1-carboxylic acid or 6-hydroxynaphthalene-<br>
1-carboxylic acid,<br>
methylenebishydroxybenzoic acids, such as 5,5'-methylene-<br><br>
bls-4-hydroxybenzoic acid,<br>
methyleneblshydroxynaphtholc acids, such as embonlc acid, hydroxyclimamic aclda such as ferulic acid, hydroxyhippuric acids such as salicyluric acid.<br><br>
The representation is a simplification because the actual structure in the salt and especially an exact localization of the charge are undetermined. The compounds where m is about 1 are particularly preferred'<br>
The term XH in the abovementioned formula I can of course also Include the anion of a diprotic acid, from which it follows that the term strictly speaking would then have to be X1/2H.<br>
The invention furthermore includes processes for the preparation of the salts of the formula X, which comprise<br>
1. reacting a water-soluble salt of the formula I, for example a dihydrochloride, dihydroiodide or a sulfate, with salts of the carboxylic acids of the formula II, III, IV or V, or<br><br><br>
in which n has the meaning mentioned for formula I, with the carboxylic acids of the formula II, III, IV or V.<br>
The preparation of the water-soluble salts of the formula I is described in the patent applications cited above, and that of the betaine of the formula VI in European Patent EP 64740 (US 5 071 979}.<br>
According to process 1, a water-soluble salt of the carboxylic acid II, III, IV or V, for example a sodium, potassium or magnesium salt, is added to a solution of one of these salts I in water, the underlying anion forming a poorly water-soluble acid addition salt of the formula I. These salts can be added in solid form or in aqueous solution or in mixtures of water and water-miscible organic solvents, e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran and DMSO.<br>
The formation of the salts of the formula I is carried out at temperatures between -10° and +60"C, preferably between +5° and +30°C. The crystallization of the salts takes place spontaneously during the addition of the salts of the carboxylic acids II - V, which are used in equimolar amounts up to an about 2.6-fold excess.<br>
The process can also be carried out by initially introducing the salts of the carboxylic acids II - V and adding the acid addition salt I dissolved in water.<br><br>
The salts of the formula I according to the invention are Isolated by filtration or centri£ugation and dried in a customary manner, for example by freeze-dryingS or with the aid of a dehydrating agent, e.g. potassium hydroxide or phosphorus pantoxide. Admixtures, e.g. of excess carboxyllc acids II - V, can optionally be removed by stirring with a water-misclble orgeuiic solvent, such as acetone, ethanol or Isopropanol.<br>
Of course, by appropriate choice of the starting components poorly aoluble salts can be obtained which contain a stoichiometric excess or deficit of the carboxyllc acid, o.g. 0.4 mol to 2.6 mol of acid per mole of betaine of the formula VI, For example, the acid content in the Salt of Example 1 can be reduced by treating with organic solvents, e.g. acetone or ethanol.<br>
According to process 2, a solution of the compound VI in water is treated with carboxyllc acids of the formulae II-V. These acids can be added In solid form or in solution, e.g. In water-mlsclble organic solvents such as acetone, ethanol or isopropanol. The reaction and crystallization are carried out as described in process 1.<br>
The compounds of the formula I obtained according to the invention have very good antibacterial activity both against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, as well as against penicillinase- and cephalosporinase-forming microorganisms. Since they moreover have favorable toxicologlcal and pharmacological properties, they are useful chemotherapeutlcs.<br>
The invention thus also relates to pharmaceuticals for the treatment of microbial infections in mammals, both in humans and in animals, and also In birds and in aquaculture, which contain the physiologically tolerable acid addition salts according to the Invention. They can also be used in combination with other active compounds, for example from the penicillin, cephalosporin or amino-<br><br>
glycoside series.<br>
The compounds of the general formula I can be administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and in animals also intratracheally or locally, e.g. in the udder of animals giving milk.<br>
In comparison with the more readily watar-soluble salts already known, the acid addition salts according to the invention in thle case have remarkable advantages which are based on their low solubility and pharmacokinetics In animals. They are absorbed slowly, e.g. in cattle, after Intramuscular (l.m.) administration, and the terminal half-lives (Table 1) and the active compound levels in plasma are distinctly prolonged coaqpared with the known salts. The terminal half-lives (t1/2) after single Injection (i,m,&gt; of 5 mg of betaine VX (n = 2) per kg of body weight for cattle are summarized In Table 1 for compounds according to the invention. The plasma concentration-time curves of cattle after single administration of various cefquinome salts I (n = 2) are shown in Figure 1 (l.m., 5 mg of betalne/kg of body weight). The known salts sulfate and dihydrclodlde from DE 3 706 020 are used as a standard. Of the acid addition salts according to the invention, the 6-hydroxy-l-naphthoate (Example 1), the cefquinome-2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (Example 11), and the salicylurate (Example 23) were shown as Examples.<br>
The salts described above which deviate from the ratio 1:1 can also be employed as depot forms and allow the pharmacokinetics in animals to be adjusted.<br><br>
Table 1: Terminal half-lives (t1/2) of cefquinome salts according to the Invention in cattle after single l.m. administration of 5 mg of betalne/kg of body weight<br><br>
Pharmaceuticals which contain one or xnore compounds of the formula I as active compound and likewise belong to the subject matter o£ the present invention can be prepared by mixing the compounds of the formula I with one or more physiologically tolerable excipients, diluents or buffer substances, and bringing them into a preparation form suitable for parenteral or local administration.<br>
Diluents which may be mentioned are, for example, poly-glycols, dimethyl sulfoxide, H-methylpyrrolidone, H,N-dlmethylacetamide, ethanol and water. Buffer substances are, for example, organic compounds, e.g. N',N'-dibenzyl-ethylenediamine, diethanolamine, athylsmlne, tris-(hydroxymethyl) aunlnomethane, or inorganic compounds, e.g. phosphate buffer, sodium dicarbonate and sodium carbonate. Suspensions or solutions in water with or without buffer substances are preferably suitable for parenteral adminis tration.<br>
For administration to humans, suitable doses of the compounds of the general formula X are approximately 0.4 to 20 g/day, preferably 0.5 to 4 g/day for an adult of<br><br>
approximately 60 kg body weight.<br>
Individual or, in general, multiple doses can be administered, it being possible for the individual dose to contain the active compound in an amount from approximately 50 to 1000 mg, preferably from approximately 120 to 500 mg.<br>
nhen administered to animals, in principle all and also birds and fish are suitable, in view of their importance in particular domestic and productive animals. The dosage varies in the individual animal species and can be, for example, between approximately 1.8 and 150, preferably between approximately 5 and 50, mg/kg of body weight of the animal.<br>
