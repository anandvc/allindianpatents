Dynamically Variable Warping Characteristic<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to audio processing using<br>
warped filters and, particularly, to multi-purpose audio<br>
coding.<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
In the context of low bitrate audio and speech coding tech-<br>
nology, several different coding techniques have tradition-<br>
ally been employed in order to achieve low bitrate coding<br>
of such signals with best possible subjective quality at a<br>
given bitrate. Coders for general music / sound signals aim<br>
at optimizing the subjective quality by shaping spectral<br>
(and temporal) shape of the quantization error according to<br>
a masking threshold curve which is estimated from the input<br>
signal by means of a perceptual model ("perceptual audio<br>
coding"). On the other hand, coding of speech at very low<br>
bit rates has been shown to work very efficiently when it<br>
is based on a production model of human speech, i.e. em-<br>
ploying Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to model the reso-<br>
nant effects of the human vocal tract together with an ef-<br>
ficient coding of the residual excitation signal.<br>
As a consequence of these two different approaches, general<br>
audio coders (like MPEG-1 Layer 3, or MPEG-2/4 Advanced Au-<br>
dio Coding, AAC) usually do not perform as well for speech<br>
signals at very low data rates as dedicated LPC-based<br>
speech coders due to the lack of exploitation of a speech<br>
source model. Conversely, LPC-based speech coders usually<br>
do not achieve convincing results when applied to general<br>
music signals because of their inability to flexibly shape<br>
the spectral envelope of the coding distortion according to<br><br>
a masking threshold curve. It is the object of the present<br>
invention to provide a concept that combines the advantages<br>
of both LPC-based coding and perceptual audio coding into a<br>
single framework and thus describes unified audio coding<br>
that is efficient for both general audio and speech sig-<br>
nals.<br>
The following section describes a set of relevant technolo-<br>
gies which have been proposed for efficient coding of audio<br>
and speech signals.<br>
Perceptual audio coding (Fig. 9)<br>
Traditionally, perceptual audio coders use a filterbank-<br>
based approach to efficiently code audio signals and shape<br>
the quantization distortion according to an estimate of the<br>
masking curve.<br>
Figure 9 shows the basic block diagram of a monophonic per-<br>
ceptual coding system. An analysis filterbank is used to<br>
map the time domain samples into sub sampled spectral com-<br>
ponents .<br>
Dependent on the number of spectral components, the system<br>
is also referred to as a subband coder (small number of<br>
subbands, e.g. 32) or a filterbank-based coder (large num-<br>
ber of frequency lines, e.g. 512). A perceptual ("psycho-<br>
acoustic") model is used to estimate the actual time de-<br>
pendent masking threshold. The spectral ("subband" or "fre-<br>
quency domain") components are quantized and coded in such<br>
a way that the quantization noise is hidden under the ac-<br>
tual transmitted signal and is not perceptible after decod-<br>
ing. This is achieved by varying the granularity of quanti-<br>
zation of the spectral values over time and frequency.<br>
As an alternative to the entirely filterbank-based-based<br>
perceptual coding concept, coding based on the pre-/ post-<br><br>
filtering approach has been proposed much more recently as<br>
shown in Fig. 10.<br>
In [Ed100], a perceptual audio coder has been proposed<br>
which separates the aspects of irrelevance reduction (i.e.<br>
noise shaping according to perceptual criteria) and redun-<br>
dancy reduction (i.e. obtaining a mathematically more com-<br>
pact representation of information) by using a so-called<br>
pre-filter rather than a variable quantization of the spec-<br>
tral coefficients over frequency. The principle is illus-<br>
trated in the following figure. The input signal is ana-<br>
lyzed by a perceptual model to compute an estimate of the<br>
masking threshold curve over frequency. The masking thresh-<br>
old is converted into a set of pre-filter coefficients such<br>
that the magnitude of its frequency response is inversely<br>
proportional to the masking threshold. The pre-filter op-<br>
eration applies this set of coefficients to the input sig-<br>
nal which produces an output signal wherein all frequency<br>
components are represented according to their perceptual<br>
importance ("perceptual whitening"). This signal is subse-<br>
quently coded by any kind of audio coder which produces a<br>
"white" quantization distortion, i.e. does not apply any<br>
perceptual noise shaping. Thus, the transmission / storage<br>
of the audio signal includes both the coder's bit-stream<br>
and a coded version of the pre-filtering coefficients. In<br>
the decoder, the coder bit-stream is decoded into an inter-<br>
mediate audio signal which is then subjected to a post-<br>
filtering operation according to the transmitted filter co-<br>
efficients. Since the post-filter performs the inverse fil-<br>
tering process relative to the pre-filter, it applies a<br>
spectral weighting to its input signal according to the<br>
masking curve. In this way, the spectrally flat ("white")<br>
coding noise appears perceptually shaped at the decoder<br>
output, as intended.<br>
Since in such a scheme perceptual noise shaping is achieved<br>
via the pre-/post-filtering step rather than frequency de-<br>
pendent quantization of spectral coefficients, the concept<br><br>
can be generalized to include non-filterbank-based coding<br>
mechanism for representing the pre-filtered audio signal<br>
rather than a filterbank-based audio coder. In [Sch02] this<br>
is shown for time domain coding kernel using predictive and<br>
entropy coding stages.<br>

ceptual Audio Coding using Adaptive Pre- and Post-<br>
Filters and Lossless Compression", IEEE Transac-<br>

In order to enable appropriate spectral noise shaping by<br>
using pre-/post-filtering techniques, it is important to<br>
adapt the frequency resolution of the pre-/post-filter to<br>
that of the human auditory system. Ideally, the frequency<br>
resolution would follow well-known perceptual frequency<br>
scales, such as the BARK or ERB frequency scale [Zwi]. This<br>
is especially desirable in order to minimize the order of<br>
the pre-/post-filter model and thus the associated computa-<br>
tional complexity and side information transmission rate.<br>
The adaptation of the pre-/post-filter frequency resolution<br>
can be achieved by the well-known frequency warping concept<br>
[KHL97]. Essentially, the unit delays within a filter<br>
structure are replaced by (first or higher order) allpass<br>
filters which leads to a non-uniform deformation ("warp-<br>
ing") of the frequency response of the filter. It has been<br>
shown that even by using a first-order allpass filter (e.g.<br>
a quite accurate approximation of perceptual fre-<br>
quency scales is possible by an appropriate choice of the<br>
allpass coefficients [SA99]. Thus, most known systems do<br><br>
not make use of higher-order allpass filters for frequency<br>
warping. Since a first-order allpass filter is fully deter-<br>
mined by a single scalar parameter (which will be referred<br>
to as the "warping factor" -1
deformation of the frequency scale. For example, for a<br>
warping factor of λ=0, no deformation is effective, i.e.<br>
the filter operates on the regular frequency scale. The<br>
higher the warping factor is chosen, the more frequency re-<br>
solution is focused on the lower frequency part of the<br>
spectrum (as it is necessary to approximate a perceptual<br>
frequency scale), and taken away from the higher frequency<br>
part of the spectrum) . This is shown in Fig. 5 for both<br>
positive and negative warping coefficients:<br>
Using a warped pre-/post-filter, audio coders typically use<br>
a filter order between 8 and 20 at common sampling rates<br>
like 48kHz or 44.1kHz [WSKH05].<br>
Several other applications of warped filtering have been<br>
described, e.g. modeling of room impulse responses [HKS00]<br>
and parametric modeling of a noise component in the audio<br>
signal (under the equivalent name Laguerre / Kauz filter-<br>
ing) [SOB03]<br>

LPC-Based Speech Coding<br>
Traditionally, efficient speech coding has been based on<br>
Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to model the resonant ef-<br>
fects of the human vocal tract together with an efficient<br>
coding of the residual excitation signal [VM06]. Both LPC<br>
and excitation parameters are transmitted from the encoder<br>
to the decoder. This principle is illustrated in the fol-<br>
lowing figure (encoder and decoder).<br>
Over time, many methods have been proposed with respect to<br>
an efficient and perceptually convincing representation of<br>
the residual (excitation) signal, such as Multi-Pulse Exci-<br>
tation (MPE), Regular Pulse Excitation (RPE), and Code-<br>
Excited Linear Prediction (CELP).<br>
Linear Predictive Coding attempts to produce an estimate of<br>
the current sample value of a sequence based on the obser-<br>
vation of a certain number of past values as a linear com-<br>
bination of the past observations. In order to reduce re-<br>
dundancy in the input signal, the encoder LPC filter "whit-<br>
ens" the input signal in its spectral envelope, i.e. its<br>
frequency response is a model of the inverse of the sig-<br>
nal's spectral envelope. Conversely, the frequency response<br><br>
of the decoder LPC filter is a model of the signal's spec-<br>
tral envelope. Specifically, the well-known auto-regressive<br>
(AR) linear predictive analysis is known to model the sig-<br>
nal's spectral envelope by means of an all-pole approxima-<br>
tion.<br>
Typically, narrow band speech coders (i.e. speech coders<br>
with a sampling rate of 8kHz) employ an LPC filter with an<br>
order between 8 and 12. Due to the nature of the LPC fil-<br>
ter, a uniform frequency resolution is effective across the<br>
full frequency range. This does not correspond to a percep-<br>
tual frequency scale.<br>
Warped LPC Coding<br>
Noticing that a non-uniform frequency sensitivity, as it is<br>
offered by warping techniques, may offer advantages also<br>
for speech coding, there have been proposals to substitute<br>
the regular LPC analysis by warped predictive analysis.<br>
Specifically, [TML94] proposes a speech coder that models<br>
the speech spectral envelope by cepstral coefficients c(m)<br>
which are updated sample by sample according to the time-<br>
varying input signal. The frequency scale of the model is<br>
adapted to approximate the perceptual MEL scale [Zwi] by<br>
using a first order all-pass filter instead of the usual<br>
unit delay. A fixed value of 0.31 for the warping coeffi-<br>
cient is used at the coder sampling rate of 8kHz. The ap-<br>
proach has been developed further to include a CELP coding<br>
core for representing the excitation signal in [KTK95],<br>
again using a fixed value of 0.31 for the warping coeffi-<br>
cient at the coder sampling rate of 8kHz.<br>
Even though the authors claim good performance of the pro-<br>
posed scheme, state-of-the-art speech coding did not adopt<br>
the warped predictive coding techniques.<br><br>
Other combinations of warped LPC and CELP coding are known,<br>
e.g. [HLM99] for which a warping factor of 0.723 is used at<br>
a sampling rate of 44.1kHz.<br>

Generalized Warped LPC Coding<br>
The idea of performing speech coding on a warped frequency<br>
scale was developed further over the following years. Spe-<br>
cifically, it was noticed that a full conventional warping<br>
of the spectral analysis according to a perceptual fre-<br>
quency scale may not be appropriate to achieve best possi-<br>
ble quality for coding speech signals. Therefore, a Mel-<br>
generalized cepstral analysis was proposed in [KTK96] which<br>
allows to fade the characteristics of the spectral model<br><br>
between that of the previously proposed mel-cepstral analy-<br>
sis (with a fully warped frequency scale and a cepstral<br>
analysis), and the characteristics of a traditional LPC mo-<br>
del (with a uniform frequency scale and an all-pole model<br>
of the signal's spectral envelope). Specifically, the pro-<br>
posed generalized analysis has two parameters that control<br>
these characteristics:<br>
•	The parameter γ ,-1≤γ≤0 continuously fades between a<br>
cepstral-type and an LPC-type of analysis, where γ=0<br>
corresponds to a cepstral-type analysis and γ=-1 cor-<br>
responds to an LPC-type analysis.<br>
•	The parameter α, |α|
of α=0 corresponds to a fully uniform frequency scale<br>
(like in standard LPC), and a value of α=0.31 corre-<br>
sponds to a full perceptual frequency warping.<br>
The same concept was applied to coding of wideband speech<br>
(at a sampling rate of 16kHz) in [KHT98] . It should be<br>
noted that the operating point (γ; α) for such a general-<br>
ized analysis is chosen a priori and not varied over time.<br>

IEEE ICASSP'98, pp. 161 - 164, 1998.<br>
A structure comprising both an encoding filter and two al-<br>
ternate coding kernels has been described previously in the<br>
literature ("WB-AMR+ Coder" [BLS05]). There does not exist<br><br>
any notion of using a warped filter, or even a filter with<br>
time-varying warping characteristics.<br>
[BLS05J B. Bessette, R. Lefebvre, R. Salami, "UNIVERSAL<br>
SPEECH/AUDIO CODING USING HYBRID ACELP/TCX TECH-<br>
NIQUES," Proc. IEEE ICASSP 2005, pp. 301 - 304,<br>
2005.<br>
The disadvantage of all those prior art techniques is that<br>
they all are dedicated to a specific audio coding algo-<br>
rithm. Any speech coder using warping filters is optimally<br>
adapted for speech signals, but commits compromises when it<br>
comes to encoding of general audio signals such as music<br>
signals.<br>
On the other hand, general audio coders are optimized to<br>
perfectly hide the quantization noise below the masking<br>
threshold, i.e., are optimally adapted to perform an ir-<br>
relevance reduction. To this end, they have a functionality<br>
for accounting for the non-uniform frequency resolution of<br>
the human hearing mechanism. However, due to the fact that<br>
they are general audio encoders, they cannot specifically<br>
make use of any a-priori knowledge on a specific kind of<br>
signal patterns which are the reason for obtaining the very<br>
low bitrates known from e.g. speech coders.<br>
Furthermore, many speech coders are time-domain encoders<br>
using fixed and variable codebooks, while most general au-<br>
dio coders are, due to the masking threshold issue, which<br>
is a frequency measure, filterbank-based encoders so that<br>
it is highly problematic to introduce both coders into a<br>
single encoding/decoding frame in an efficient manner, al-<br>
though there also exist time-domain based general audio en-<br>
coders.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an im-<br>
proved general purpose coding concept providing high qual-<br>
ity and low bitrate not only for specific signal patterns<br>
but even for general audio signals.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by an audio encoder for en-<br>
coding an audio signal, comprising a pre-filter for gener-<br>
ating a pre-filtered audio signal, the pre- filter having a<br>
variable warping characteristic, the warping characteristic<br>
being controllable in response to a time-varying control<br>
signal, the control signal indicating a small or no warping<br>
characteristic or a comparatively high warping character-<br>
istic; a controller for providing the time-varying control<br>
signal, the time-varying control signal depending on the<br>
audio signal; and a controllable encoding processor for<br>
processing the pre-filtered audio signal to obtain an en-<br>
coded audio signal, wherein the encoding processor is<br>
adapted to process the pre-filtered audio signal in accor-<br>
dance with a first coding algorithm adapted to a specific<br>
signal pattern, or in accordance with a second different<br>
encoding algorithm suitable for encoding a general audio<br>
signal.<br>
Preferably, the encoding processor is adapted to be con-<br>
trolled by the controller so that an audio signal portion<br>
being filtered using the comparatively high warping charac-<br>
teristic is processed using the second encoding algorithm<br>
to obtain the encoded signal and an audio signal being fil-<br>
tered using the small or no warping characteristic is proc-<br>
essed using the first encoding algorithm.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by an audio decoder for de-<br>
coding an encoded audio signal, the encoded audio signal<br>
having a first portion encoded in accordance with a first<br>
coding algorithm adapted to a specific signal pattern, and<br>
having a second portion encoded in accordance with a dif-<br><br>
ferent second coding algorithm suitable for encoding a gen-<br>
eral audio signal, comprising: a detector for detecting a<br>
coding algorithm underlying the first portion or the second<br>
portion; a decoding processor for decoding, in response to<br>
the detector, the first portion using the first coding al-<br>
gorithm to obtain a first decoded time portion and for de-<br>
coding the second portion using the second coding algorithm<br>
to obtain a second decoded time portion; and a post-filter<br>
having a variable warping characteristic being controllable<br>
between a first state having a small or no warping charac-<br>
teristic and a second state having a comparatively high<br>
warping characteristic.<br>
Preferably, the post-filter is controlled such that the<br>
first decoded time portion is filtered using the small or<br>
no warping characteristic and the second decoded time por-<br>
tion is filtered using a comparatively high warping charac-<br>
teristic.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by an audio processor for<br>
processing an audio signal, comprising: a filter for gener-<br>
ating a filtered audio signal, the filter having a variable<br>
warping characteristic, the warping characteristic being<br>
controllable in response to a time-varying control signal,<br>
the control signal indicating a small or no warping charac-<br>
teristic or a comparatively high warping characteristic;<br>
and a controller for providing the time-varying control<br>
signal, the time-varying control signal depending on the<br>
audio signal.<br>
Further aspects of the present invention relate to corre-<br>
sponding methods of encoding, decoding and audio processing<br>
as well as associated computer programs and the encoded au-<br>
dio signal.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a pre-<br>
filter having a variable warping characteristic on the au-<br><br>
dio encoder side is the key feature for integrating differ-<br>
ent coding algorithms to a single encoder frame. These two<br>
different coding algorithms are different from each other.<br>
The first coding algorithm is adapted to a specific signal<br>
pattern such as speech signals, but also any other specifi-<br>
cally harmonic patterns, pitched patterns or transient pat-<br>
terns are an option, while the second coding algorithm is<br>
suitable for encoding a general audio signal. The pre-<br>
filter on the encoder-side or the post-filter on the de-<br>
coder-side make it possible to integrate the signal spe-<br>
cific coding module and the general coding module within a<br>
single encoder/decoder framework.<br>
Generally, the input for the general audio encoder module<br>
or the signal specific encoder module can be warped to a<br>
higher or lower or no degree. This depends on the specific<br>
signal and the implementation of the encoder modules. Thus,<br>
the interrelation of which warp filter characteristic be-<br>
longs to which coding module can be signaled. In several<br>
cases the result might be that the stronger warping charac-<br>
teristic belongs to the general audio coder and the lighter<br>
or no warping characteristic belongs to the signal specific<br>
module. This situation can - in some embodiments - fixedly<br>
set or can be the result of dynamically signaling the en-<br>
coder module for a certain signal portion.<br>
While the coding algorithm adapted for specific signal pat-<br>
terns normally does not heavily rely on using the masking<br>
threshold for irrelevance reduction, this coding algorithm<br>
does not necessarily need any warping pre-processing or<br>
only a "soft" warping pre-processing. This means that the<br>
first coding algorithm adapted for a specific signal pat-<br>
tern advantageously uses a-priori knowledge on the specific<br>
signal pattern but does not rely that much on the masking<br>
threshold and, therefore, does not need to approach the<br>
non-uniform frequency resolution of the human listening<br>
mechanism. The non-uniform frequency resolution of the hu-<br>
man listening mechanism is reflected by scale factor bands<br><br>
having different bandwidths along the frequency scale. This<br>
non-uniform frequency scale is also known as the BARK or<br>
ERB scale.<br>
Processing and noise shaping using a non-uniform frequency<br>
resolution is only necessary, when the coding algorithm<br>
heavily relies on irrelevance reduction by utilizing the<br>
concept of a masking threshold, but is not required for a<br>
specific coding algorithm which is adapted to a specific<br>
signal pattern and uses a-priori knowledge to highly effi-<br>
ciently process such a specific signal pattern. In fact,<br>
any non-uniform frequency warping processing might be harm-<br>
ful for the efficiency of such a specific signal pattern<br>
adapted coding algorithm, since such warping will influence<br>
the specific signal pattern which, due to the fact that the<br>
first coding algorithm is heavily optimized for a specific<br>
signal pattern, may strongly degrade coding efficiency of<br>
the first coding algorithm.<br>
Contrary thereto, the second coding algorithm can only pro-<br>
duce an acceptable output bitrate together with an accept-<br>
able audio quality, when any measure is taken which ac-<br>
counts for the non-uniform frequency resolution of the hu-<br>
man listening mechanism so that optimum benefit can be<br>
drawn from the masking threshold.<br>
Since the audio signal may include specific signal patterns<br>
followed by general audio, i.e., a signal not having this<br>
specific signal pattern or only having this specific signal<br>
pattern to a small extent, the inventive pre-filter only<br>
warps to a strong degree, when there is a signal portion<br>
not having the specific signal pattern, while for a signal<br>
not having the specific signal pattern, no warping at all<br>
or only a small warping characteristic is applied.<br>
Particularly for the case, where the first coding algorithm<br>
is any coding algorithm relying on linear predictive cod-<br>
ing, and where the second coding algorithm is a general au-<br><br>
dio coder based on a per-filter/post-filter architecture,<br>
the pre-filter can perform different tasks using the same<br>
filter. When the audio signal has the specific signal pat-<br>
tern, the pre-filter works as an LPC analysis filter so<br>
that the first encoding algorithm is only related to the<br>
encoding of the residual signal or the LPC excitation sig-<br>
nal.<br>
When there is a signal portion which does not have the spe-<br>
cific signal pattern, the pre-filter is controlled to have<br>
a strong warping characteristic and, preferably, to perform<br>
LPC filtering based on the psycho-acoustic masking thresh-<br>
old so that the pre-filtered output signal is filtered by<br>
the frequency-warped filter and is such that psychoacousti-<br>
cally more important spectral portions are amplified with<br>
respect to psychoacoustically less important spectral por-<br>
tions. Then, a straight-forward quantizer can be used, or,<br>
generally stated, quantization during encoding can take<br>
place without having to distribute the coding noise non-<br>
uniformly over the frequency range in the output of the<br>
warped filter. The noise shaping of the quantization noise<br>
will automatically take place by the post-filtering action<br>
obtained by the time-varying warped filter on the decoder-<br>
side, which is - with respect to the warping characteristic<br>
- identical to the encoder-side pre-filter and, due to the<br>
fact that this filter is inverse to the pre-filter on the<br>
decoder side, automatically produces the noise shaping to<br>
obtain a maximum irrelevance reduction while maintaining a<br>
high audio quality.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a<br>
uniform method that allows coding of both general audio<br>
signals and speech signals with a coding performance that -<br>
at least - matches the performance of the best known coding<br>
schemes for both types of signals. It is based on the fol-<br>
lowing considerations:<br>
•	For coding of general audio signals, it is essential<br>
to shape the coding noise spectral envelope according<br>
to a masking threshold curve (according to the idea of<br>
"perceptual audio coding"), and thus a perceptually<br>
warped frequency scale is desirable. Nonetheless, the-<br>
re may be certain (e.g. harmonic) audio signals where<br>
a uniform frequency resolution would perform better<br>
that a perceptually warped one because the former can<br>
better resolve their individual spectral fine struc-<br>
ture.<br>
•	For the coding of speech signals, the state of the art<br>
coding performance can be achieved by means of regular<br>
(non-warped) linear prediction. There may be certain<br>
speech signals for which some amount of warping im-<br>
proves the coding performance.<br>
In accordance with the inventive idea, this dilemma is sol-<br>
ved by a coding system that includes an encoder filter that<br>
can smoothly fade in its characteristics between a fully<br>
warped operation, as it is generally preferable for coding<br>
of music signals, and a non-warped operation, as it is gen-<br>
erally preferable for coding of speech signals. Specifi-<br>
cally, the proposed inventive approach includes a linear<br>
filter with a time-varying warping factor. This filter is<br>
controlled by an extra input that receives the desired<br>
warping factor and modifies the filter operation accord-<br>
ingly.<br><br>
An operation of such a filter permits the filter to act<br>
both as a model of the masking curve (post-filter for cod-<br>
ing of music, with warping on, λ = λ0) , and as a model of<br>
the signal's spectral envelope (Inverse LPC filter for cod-<br>
ing of speech, with warping off, λ=0) , depending on the<br>
control input. If the inventive filter is equipped to han-<br>
dle also a continuum of intermediate warping factors<br>
0≤λ≤λ0 then furthermore also soft in-between characteris-<br>
tics are possible.<br>
Naturally, the inverse decoder filtering mechanism is simi-<br>
larly equipped, i.e. a linear decoder filter with a time-<br>
varying warping factor and can act as a perceptual pre-<br>
filter as well as an LPC filter.<br>
In order to generate a well-behaved filtered signal to be<br>
coded subsequently, it is desirable to not switch instanta-<br>
neously between two different values of the warping factor,<br>
but to apply a soft transition of the warping factor over<br>
time. As an example, a transition of 128 samples between<br>
unwarped and fully perceptually warped operation avoids un-<br>
desirable discontinuities in the output signal.<br>
Using such a filter with variable warping, it is possible<br>
to build a combined speech / audio coder which achieves<br>
both optimum speech and audio coding quality in the follow-<br>
ing way (see Fig. 7 or 8):<br>
• The decision about the coding mode to be used ("Speech<br>
mode" or "Music mode") is performed in a separate mod-<br>
ule by carrying out an analysis of the input signal<br>
and can be based on known techniques for discriminat-<br>
ing speech signals from music. As a result, the deci-<br>
sion module produces a decision about the coding mode<br>
/ and an associated optimum warping factor for the<br>
filter. Furthermore, depending on the this decision,<br>
it determines a set of suitable filter coefficients<br>
which are appropriate for the input signal at the cho-<br><br>
sen coding mode, i.e. for coding of speech, an LPC<br>
analysis is performed (with no warping, or a low warp-<br>
ing factor) whereas for coding of music, a masking<br>
curve is estimated and its inverse is converted into<br>
warped spectral coefficients.<br>
•	The filter with the time varying warping characteris-<br>
tics is used as a common encoder / decoder filter and<br>
is applied to the signal depending on the coding mode<br>
decision / warping factor and the set of filter coef-<br>
ficients produced by the decision module.<br>
•	The output signal of the filtering stage is coded by<br>
either a speech coding kernel (e.g. CELP coder) or a<br>
generic audio coder kernel (e.g. a filterbank/subband<br>
coder, or a predictive audio coder), or both, depend-<br>
ing on the coding mode.<br>
•	The information to the transmitted / stored comprises<br>
the coding mode decision (or an indication of the<br>
warping factor), the filter coefficients in some coded<br>
form, and the information delivered by the speech /<br>
excitation and the generic audio coder.<br>
The corresponding decoder works accordingly: It receives<br>
the transmitted information, decodes the speech and generic<br>
audio parts according to the coding mode information, com-<br>
bines them into a single intermediate signal (e.g. by add-<br>
ing them), and filters this intermediate signal using the<br>
coding mode / warping factor and filter coefficients to<br>
form the final output signal.<br>
Subsequently, a preferred embodiment of the inventive audio<br>
encoder will be discussed in connection with Fig. 1. The<br>
Fig. 1 audio encoder is operative for encoding an audio<br>
signal input at line 10. The audio signal is input into a<br>
pre-filter 12 for generating a pre-filtered audio signal<br>
appearing at line 14. The pre-filter has a variable warping<br><br>
characteristic, the warping characteristic being controlla-<br>
ble in response to a time-varying control signal on<br>
line 16. The control signal indicates a small or no warping<br>
characteristic or a comparatively high warping characteris-<br>
tic. Thus, the time-varying warp control signal can be a<br>
signal having two different states such as "1" for a strong<br>
warp or a "0" for no warping. The intended goal for apply-<br>
ing warping is to obtain a frequency resolution of the pre-<br>
filter similar to the BARK scale. However, also different<br>
states of the signal / warping characteristic setting are<br>
possible.<br>
Furthermore, the inventive audio encoder includes a con-<br>
troller 18 for providing the time-varying control signal,<br>
wherein the time varying control signal depends on the au-<br>
dio signal as shown by line 20 in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the<br>
inventive audio encoder includes a controllable encoding<br>
processor 22 for processing the pre-filtered audio signal<br>
to obtain an encoded audio signal output at line 24.. Par-<br>
ticularly, the encoding processor 22 is adapted to process<br>
the pre-filtered audio signal in accordance with a first<br>
coding algorithm adapted to a specific signal pattern, or<br>
in accordance with a second, different encoding algorithm<br>
suitable for encoding a general audio signal. Particularly,<br>
the encoding processor 22 is adapted to be controlled by<br>
the controller 18 preferably via a separate encoder control<br>
signal on line 26 so that an audio signal portion being<br>
filtered using the comparatively high warping factor is<br>
processed using the second encoding algorithm to obtain the<br>
encoded signal for this audio signal portion, so that an<br>
audio signal portion being filtered using no or only a<br>
small warping characteristic is processed using the first<br>
encoding algorithm.<br>
Thus, as it is shown in the control table 28 for the signal<br>
on control line 26, in some situations when processing an<br>
audio signal, no or only a small warp is performed by the<br>
filter for a signal being filtered in accordance with the<br><br>
first coding algorithm, while, when a strong and preferably<br>
perceptually full-scale warp is applied by the pre-filter,<br>
the time portion is processed using the second coding algo-<br>
rithm for general audio signals, which is preferably based<br>
on hiding quantization noise below a psycho-acoustic mask-<br>
ing threshold. Naturally, the invention also covers the<br>
case that for a further portion of the audio signal, which<br>
has the signal-specific pattern, a high warping character-<br>
istic is applied while for an even further portion not hav-<br>
ing the specific signal pattern, a low or no warping char-<br>
acteristic is used. This can be for example determined by<br>
an analysis by synthesis encoder decision or by any other<br>
algorithms know in the art. However, the encoder module<br>
control can also be fixedly set depending on the transmit-<br>
ted warping factor or the warping factor can be derived<br>
from a transmitted coder module indication. Furthermore,<br>
both information items can be transmitted as side informa-<br>
tion, i.e., the coder module and the warping factor.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an inventive decoder for decoding an en-<br>
coded audio signal input at line 30. The encoded audio sig-<br>
nal has a first portion encoded in accordance with a first<br>
coding algorithm adapted to a specific signal pattern, and<br>
has a second portion encoded in accordance with a different<br>
second coding algorithm suitable for encoding a general au-<br>
dio signal. Particularly, the inventive decoder comprises a<br>
detector 32 for detecting a coding algorithm underlying the<br>
first or the second portion. This detection can take place<br>
by extracting side information from the encoded audio sig-<br>
nal as illustrated by broken line 34, and/or can take place<br>
by examining the bit-stream coming into a decoding proces-<br>
sor 36 as illustrated by broken line 38. The decoding proc-<br>
essor 36 is for decoding in response to the detector as il-<br>
lustrated by control line 40 so that for both the first and<br>
second portions the correct coding algorithm is selected.<br>
Preferably, the decoding processor is operative to use the<br>
first coding algorithm for decoding the first time portion<br><br>
and to use the second coding algorithm for decoding the<br>
second time portion so that the first and the second de-<br>
coded time portions are output on line 42. Line 42 carries<br>
the input into a post-filter 44 having a variable warping<br>
characteristic. Particularly, the post-filter 44 is con-<br>
trollable using a time-varying warp control signal on<br>
line 46 so that this post-filter has only small or no warp-<br>
ing characteristic in a first state and has a high warping<br>
characteristic in a second state.<br>
Preferably, the post-filter 44 is controlled such that the<br>
first time portion decoded using the first coding algorithm<br>
is filtered using the small or no warping characteristic<br>
and the second time portion of the decoded audio signal is<br>
filtered using the comparatively strong warping character-<br>
istic so that an audio decoder output signal is obtained at<br>
line 48.<br>
When looking at Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the first coding algo-<br>
rithm determines the encoder-related steps to be taken in<br>
the encoding processor 22 and the corresponding decoder-<br>
related steps to be implemented in decoding processor 36.<br>
Furthermore, the second coding algorithm determines the en-<br>
coder-related second coding algorithm steps to be used in<br>
the encoding processor and corresponding second coding al-<br>
gorithm-related decoding steps to be used in decoding proc-<br>
essor 36.<br>
Furthermore, the pre-filter 12 and the post-filter 44 are,<br>
in general, inverse to each other. The warping characteris-<br>
tics of those filters are controlled such that the post-<br>
filter has the same warping characteristic as the pre-<br>
filter or at least a similar warping characteristic within<br>
a 10 percent tolerance range.<br>
Naturally, when the pre-filter is not warped due to the<br>
fact that there is e.g. a signal having the specific signal<br><br>
pattern, then the post-filter also does not have to be a<br>
warped filter.<br>
Nevertheless, the pre-filter 12 as well as the post-<br>
filter 44 can implement any other pre-filter or post-filter<br>
operations required in connection with the first coding al-<br>
gorithm or the second coding algorithm as will be outlined<br>
later on.<br>
Fig. 3a illustrates an example of an encoded audio signal<br>
as obtained on line 24 of Fig. 1 and as can be found on<br>
line 30 of Fig. 2. Particularly, the encoded audio signal<br>
includes a first time portion in encoded form, which has<br>
been generated by the first coding algorithm as outlined<br>
at 50 and corresponding side information 52 for the first<br>
portion. Furthermore, the bit-stream includes a second time<br>
portion in encoded form as shown at 54 and side information<br>
56 for the second time portion. It is to be noted here that<br>
the order of the items in Fig. 3a may vary. Furthermore,<br>
the side information does not necessarily have to be multi-<br>
plexed between the main information 50 and 54. Those sig-<br>
nals can even come from separate sources as dictated by ex-<br>
ternal requirements or implementations.<br>
Fig. 3b illustrates side information for the explicit sig-<br>
naling embodiment of the present invention for explicitly<br>
signaling the warping factor and encoder mode, which can be<br>
used in 52 and 56 of Fig. 3a. This is indicated below the<br>
Fig. 3b side information stream. Hence, the side informa-<br>
tion may include a coding mode indication explicitly sig-<br>
naling the first or the second coding algorithm underlying<br>
this portion to which the side information belongs to.<br>
Furthermore, a warping factor can be signaled. Signaling of<br>
the warping factor is not necessary, when the whole system<br>
can only use two different warping characteristics, i.e.,<br>
no warping characteristic as the first possibility and a<br>
perceptually full-scale warping characteristic as the sec-<br><br>
ond possibility. In this case, a warping factor can be<br>
fixed and does not necessarily have to be transmitted.<br>
Nevertheless, in preferred embodiments, the warping factor<br>
can have more than these two extreme values so that an ex-<br>
plicit signaling of the warping factor such as by absolute<br>
values or differentially coded values is used.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the pre-filter not only<br>
implements is warped but also implements tasks dictated by<br>
the first coding algorithm and the second coding algorithm,<br>
which leads to a more efficient functionality of the first<br>
and the second coding algorithms.<br>
When the first coding algorithm is an LPC-based coding al-<br>
gorithm, then the pre-filter also performs the functional-<br>
ity of the LPC analysis filter and the post-filter on the<br>
decoder-side performs the functionality of an LPC synthesis<br>
filter.<br>
When the second coding algorithm is a general audio encoder<br>
not having a specific noise shaping functionality, the pre-<br>
filter is preferably an LPC filter, which pre-filters the<br>
audio signal so that, after pre-filtering, psychoacousti-<br>
cally more important portions are amplified with respect to<br>
psychoacoustically less important portions. On the decoder-<br>
side, the post-filter is implemented as a filter for re-<br>
generating a situation similar to a situation before pre-<br>
filtering, i.e. an inverse filter which amplifies less im-<br>
portant portions with respect to more important portions so<br>
that the signal after post-filtering is - apart from coding<br>
errors - similar to the original audio signal input into<br>
the encoder.<br>
The filter coefficients for the above described pre-filter<br>
are preferably also transmitted via side information from<br>
the encoder to the decoder.<br><br>
Typically, the pre-filter as well as the post-filter will<br>
be implemented as a warped FIR filter, a structure of which<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 4, or as a warped IIR digital fil-<br>
ter. The Fig. 4 filter is described in detail in [KHL 97] .<br>
Examples for warped IIR filters are also shown in [KHL 97].<br>
All those digital filters have in common that they have<br>
warped delay elements 60 and weighting coefficients or<br>
weighting elements indicated by β0, . β1, β2. ,.... A filter<br>
structure is transformed to a warped filter, when a delay<br>
element in an unwarped filter structure (not shown here) is<br>
replaced by an all-pass filter, such as a first-order all-<br>
pass filter D(z), as illustrated in on both sides of the<br>
filter structures in Fig. 4. A computationally efficient<br>
implementation of the left structure is shown in the right<br>
of Fig. 4, where the explicit usage of the warping factor λ<br>
and the implementation thereof is shown.<br>
Thus, the filter structure to the right of Fig. 4 can eas-<br>
ily be implemented within the pre-filter as well as within<br>
the post-filter, wherein the warping factor is controlled<br>
by the parameter λ, while the filter characteristic, i.e.,<br>
the filter coefficients of the LPC analysis/synthesis or<br>
pre-filtering or post-filtering for amplifying/damping psy-<br>
cho-acoustically more important portions is controlled by<br>
setting the weighting parameters β0, β1, Β2,.... to appropriate<br>
values.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the dependence of the frequency-warping<br>
characteristic on the warping factor λ for λs between -0.8<br>
and +0.8. No warping at all will be obtained, when λ is set<br>
to 0.0. A psycho-acoustically full-scale warp is obtained<br>
by setting λ between 0.3 and 0.4. Generally, the optimum<br>
warping factor depends on the chosen sampling rate and has<br>
a value of between about 0.3 and 0.4 for sampling rates be-<br>
tween 32 and 48 kHz. The then obtained non-uniform fre-<br>
quency resolution by using the warped filter is similar to<br>
the BARK or ERB scale. Substantially stronger warping char-<br>
acteristics can be implemented, but those are only useful<br><br>
in certain situations, which can happen when the controller<br>
determines that those higher warping factors are useful.<br>
Thus, the pre-filter on the encoder-side will preferably<br>
have positive warping factors λ to increase the frequency<br>
resolution in the low frequency range and to decrease the<br>
frequency resolution in the high frequency range. Hence,<br>
the post-filter on the decoder-side will also have the<br>
positive warping factors. Thus, a preferred inventive time-<br>
varying warping filter is shown in Fig. 6 at 70 as a part<br>
of the audio processor. The inventive filter is, prefera-<br>
bly, a linear filter, which is implemented as a pre-filter<br>
or a post-filter for filtering to amplify or damp psycho-<br>
acoustically more/less important portions or which is im-<br>
plemented as an LPC analysis/synthesis filter depending on<br>
the control signal of the system. It is to note at this<br>
point that the warped filter is a linear filter and does<br>
not change the frequency of a component such as a sine wave<br>
input into the filter. However, when it is assumed that the<br>
filter before warping is a low pass filter, the Fig. 5 dia-<br>
gram has to be interpreted as set out below.<br>
When the example sine wave has a normalized original fre-<br>
quency of 0.6, then the filter would apply - for a warping<br>
factor equal to 0.0 - the phase and amplitude weighting de-<br>
fined by the filter impulse response of this unwarped fil-<br>
ter.<br>
When a warping factor of 0.8 is set for this lowpass filter<br>
(now the filter becomes a warped filter) , the sine wave<br>
having a normalized frequency of 0.6 will be filtered such<br>
that the output is weighted by the phase and amplitude<br>
weighting which the unwarped filter has for a normalized<br>
frequency of 0.97 in Fig. 5. Since this filter is a linear<br>
filter, the frequency of the sine wave is not changed.<br>
Depending on the situation, when the filter 70 is only<br>
warped, then a warping factor or, generally, the warping<br><br>
control 16, or 46, has to be applied. The filter coeffi-<br>
cients βi are derived from the masking threshold. These<br>
filter coefficients can be pre- or post-filter coeffi-<br>
cients, or LPC analysis/synthesis filter coefficients, or<br>
any other filter coefficients useful in connection with any<br>
first or second coding algorithms.<br>
Thus, an audio processor in accordance with the present in-<br>
vention includes, in addition to the filter having variable<br>
warping characteristics, the controller 18 of Fig. 1 or the<br>
controller implemented as the coding algorithm detector 32<br>
of Fig. 2 or a general audio input signal analyzer looking<br>
for a specific signal pattern in the audio input 10/42 so<br>
that a certain warping characteristic can be set, which<br>
fits to the specific signal pattern so that a time-adapted<br>
variable warping of the audio input be it an encoded or a<br>
decoded audio input can be obtained. Preferably, the pre-<br>
filter coefficients and the post-filter coefficients are<br>
identical.<br>
The output of the audio processor illustrated in Fig. 6<br>
which consists of the filter 70 and the controller 74 can<br>
then be stored for any purposes or can be processed by en-<br>
coding processor 22, or by an audio reproduction device<br>
when the audio processor is on the decoder-side, or can be<br>
processed by any other signal processing algorithms.<br>
Subsequently, Figs. 7 and 8 will be discussed, which show<br>
preferred embodiments of the inventive encoder (Fig. 7) and<br>
the inventive decoder (Fig. 8). The functionalities of the<br>
devices are similar to the Fig. 1, Fig. 2 devices. Particu-<br>
larly, Fig. 7 illustrates the embodiment, wherein the first<br>
coding algorithm is a speech-coder like coding algorithm,<br>
wherein the specific signal pattern is a speech pattern in<br>
the audio input 10. The second coding algorithm 22b is a<br>
generic audio coder such as the straight-forward filter-<br>
bank-based audio coder as illustrated and discussed in con-<br><br>
nection with Fig. 9, or the pre-filter/post-filter audio<br>
coding algorithm as illustrated in Fig. 10.<br>
The first coding algorithm corresponds to the Fig. 11<br>
speech coding system, which, in addition to an LPC analy-<br>
sis/synthesis filter 1100 and 1102 also includes a resid-<br>
ual/excitation coder 1104 and a corresponding excitation<br>
decoder 1106. In this embodiment, the time-varying warped<br>
filter 12 in Fig. 7 has the same functionality as the LPC<br>
filter 1100, and the LPC analysis implemented in block 1108<br>
in Fig. 11 is implemented in controller 18.<br>
The residual/excitation coder 1104 corresponds to the re-<br>
sidual/excitation coder kernel 22a in Fig. 7. Similarly,<br>
the excitation decoder 1106 corresponds to the resid-<br>
ual/excitation decoder 36a in Fig. 8, and the time-varying<br>
warped filter 44 has the functionality of the inverse LPC<br>
filter 1102 for a first time portion being coded in accor-<br>
dance with the first coding algorithm.<br>
The LPC filter coefficients generated by LPC analysis<br>
block 1108 correspond to the filter coefficients shown at<br>
90 in Fig. 7 for the first time portion and the LPC filter<br>
coefficients input into block 1102 in Fig. 11 correspond to<br>
the filter coefficients on line 92 of Fig. 8. Furthermore,<br>
the Fig. 7 encoder includes an encoder output interface 94,<br>
which can be implemented as a bit-stream multiplexer, but<br>
which can also be implemented as any other device producing<br>
a data stream suitable for transmission and/or storage.<br>
Correspondingly, the Fig. 8 decoder includes an input in-<br>
terface 96, which can be implemented as a bit-stream de-<br>
multiplexer for de-multiplexing the specific time portion<br>
information as discussed in connection with Fig. 3a and for<br>
also extracting the required side-information as illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 3b.<br>
In the Fig. 7 embodiment, both encoding kernels 22a, 22b,<br>
have a common input 96, and are controlled by the control-<br><br>
ler 18 via lines 97a and 97b. This control makes sure that,<br>
at a certain time instant, only one of both encoder ker-<br>
nels 22a, 22b outputs main and side information to the out-<br>
put interface. Alternatively, both encoding kernels could<br>
work fully parallel, and the encoder controller 18 would<br>
make sure that only the output of the encoding kernel is<br>
input into the bit-stream, which is indicated by the coding<br>
mode information while the output of the other encoder is<br>
discarded.<br>
Again alternatively, both decoders can operate in parallel<br>
and outputs thereof can be added. In this situation, it is<br>
preferred to use a medium warping characteristic for the<br>
encoder-side pre-filter and for the decoder-side post-<br>
filter. Furthermore, this embodiment processes e.g. a<br>
speech portion of a signal such as a certain frequency<br>
range or - generally - signal portion by the first coding<br>
algorithm and the remainder of the signal by the second<br>
general coding algorithm. Then outputs of both coders are<br>
transmitted from the encoder to the decoder side. The de-<br>
coder-side combination makes sure that the signal is re-<br>
joined before being post-filtered.<br>
Any kind of specific controls can be implemented as long as<br>
they make sure that the output encoded audio signal 24 has<br>
a sequence of first and second portions as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3 or a correct combination of signal portions such as<br>
a speech portion and a general audio portion.<br>
On the decoder-side, the coding mode information is used<br>
for decoding the time portion using the correct decoding<br>
algorithm so that a time-staggered pattern of first por-<br>
tions and second portions obtain at the outputs of decoder<br>
kernels 36a, and 36b, which are, then, multiplexed into a<br>
single time domain signal, which is illustrated schemati-<br>
cally using the adder symbol 36c. Then, at the output of<br>
element 36c, there is a time-domain audio signal, which<br><br>
only has to be post-filtered so that the decoded audio sig-<br>
nal is obtained.<br>
As discussed earlier in the summary after the Brief De-<br>
scription of the Drawings section, both the encoder in<br>
Fig. 7 as well as the decoder in Fig. 8 may include an in-<br>
terpolator 100 or 102 so that a smooth transition via a<br>
certain time portion, which at least includes two samples,<br>
but which preferably includes more than 50 samples and even<br>
more than 100 samples, is implementable. This makes sure<br>
that coding artifacts are avoided, which might be caused by<br>
rapid changes of the warping factor and the filter coeffi-<br>
cients. Since, however, the post-filter as well as the pre-<br>
filter fully operate in the time domain, there are no prob-<br>
lems related to block-based specific implementations. Thus,<br>
one can change, when Fig. 4 is again considered, the values<br>
for β0, β1, β2, ...and λ from sample to sample so that a fade<br>
over from a, for example, fully warped state to another<br>
state having no warp at all is possible. Although one could<br>
transmit interpolated parameters, which would save the in-<br>
terpolator on the decoder-side, it is preferred to not<br>
transmit the interpolated values but to transmit the values<br>
before interpolation since less side-information bits are<br>
required for the latter option.<br>
Furthermore, as already indicated above, the generic audio<br>
coder kernel 22b as illustrated in Fig. 7 may be identical<br>
to the coder 1000 in Fig. 10. In this context, the pre-<br>
filter 12 will also perform the functionality of the pre-<br>
filter 1002 in Fig. 10. The perceptual model 1004 in<br>
Fig. 10 will then be implemented within controller 18 of<br>
Fig. 7. The filter coefficients generated by the perceptual<br>
model 1004 correspond to the filter coefficients on line 90<br>
in Fig. 7 for a time portion, for which the second coding<br>
algorithm is on.<br>
Analogously, the decoder 1006 in Fig. 10 is implemented by<br>
the generic audio decoder kernel 36b in Fig. 8, and the<br><br>
post-filter 1008 is implemented by the time-varying warped<br>
filter 44 in Fig. 8. The preferably coded filter coeffi-<br>
cients generated by the perceptual model are received, on<br>
the decoder-side, on line 92, so that a line titled "filter<br>
coefficients" entering post-filter 1008 in Fig. 10 corre-<br>
sponds to line 92 in Fig. 8 for the second coding algorithm<br>
time portion.<br>
However, compared to two parallel working encoders in ac-<br>
cordance with Figs. 10 and 11, which are both not perfect<br>
due to audio quality and bit rate, the inventive encoder<br>
devices and the inventive decoder devices only use a sin-<br>
gle, but controllable filter and perform a discrimination<br>
on the input audio signal to find out whether the time por-<br>
tion of the audio signal has the specific pattern or is<br>
just a general audio signal.<br>
Regarding the audio analyzer within controller 18, a vari-<br>
ety of different implementations can be used for determin-<br>
ing, whether a portion of an audio signal is a portion hav-<br>
ing the specific signal pattern or whether this portion<br>
does not have this specific signal pattern, and, therefore,<br>
has to be processed using the general audio encoding algo-<br>
rithm. Although preferred embodiments have been discussed,<br>
wherein the specific signal pattern is a speech signal,<br>
other signal-specific patterns can be determined and can be<br>
encoded using such signal-specific first encoding algo-<br>
rithms such as encoding algorithm for harmonic signals, for<br>
noise signals, for tonal signals, for pulse-train-like sig-<br>
nals, etc.<br>
Straightforward detectors are analysis by synthesis detec-<br>
tors, which, for example, try different encoding algo-<br>
rithms, together with different warping detectors to find<br>
out the best warping factor together with the best filter<br>
coefficients and the best coding algorithm. Such analysis<br>
by synthesis detectors are in some cases quite computation-<br>
ally expensive. This does not matter in a situation,<br><br>
wherein there is a small number of encoders and a high num-<br>
ber of decoders, since the decoder can be very simple in<br>
that case. This is due to the fact that only the encoder<br>
performs this complex computational task, while the decoder<br>
can simply use the transmitted side-information.<br>
Other signal detectors are based on straightforward pattern<br>
analyzing algorithms, which look for a specific signal pat-<br>
tern within the audio signal and signal a positive result,<br>
when a matching degree exceeds a certain threshold. More<br>
information on such detectors is given in [BLS05].<br>
Moreover, depending on certain implementation requirements<br>
of the inventive methods, the inventive methods can be im-<br>
plemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
can be performed using a digital storage medium, in par-<br>
ticular a disk or a CD having electronically readable con-<br>
trol signals stored thereon, which can cooperate with a<br>
programmable computer system such that the inventive meth-<br>
ods are performed. Generally, the present invention is,<br>
therefore, a computer program product with a program code<br>
stored on a machine-readable carrier, the program code be-<br>
ing configured for performing at least one of the inventive<br>
methods, when the computer program products runs on a com-<br>
puter. In other words, the inventive methods are, there-<br>
fore, a computer program having a program code for perform-<br>
ing the inventive methods, when the computer program runs<br>
on a computer.<br>

indicating a small or no warping characteristic or a<br>
comparatively high warping characteristic; and<br>
providing the time-varying control signal, the time-<br>
varying control signal depending on the audio signal.<br>
49. Computer program having a program code for performing<br>
the method of claim 45, 46 or 48, when running on a<br>
computer.<br><br>
An audio encoder, an audio decoder or an audio processor includes a filter(12) for generating a filtered audio signal, the filter having a variable warping characteristic, the characteristic being controllable in response to a time-varying control signal(16), the control signal indicating a small or no warping characteristic or a comparatively high warping characteristic. Furthermore, a controller<br>
(18) is connected for providing the time-varying control signal, which depends on the audio signal. The filtered audio signal can be introduced to an encoding processor(22)<br>
having different encoding algorithms, one of which is a coding algorithm adapted to a specific signal pattern. Alternatively, the filter is a post-filter receiving a decoded<br>
audio signal.</td>
