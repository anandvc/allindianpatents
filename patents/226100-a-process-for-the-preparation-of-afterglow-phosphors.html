This invention relates to a process for the preparation of afterglow phosphors.<br>
More particularly, this invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkaline earth aluminate phosphors exhibiting a range of colours depending on the choice of the starting materials. The intensity and duration of the glow are higher than those of phosphors known to the art. The process can be carried out economically.<br>
Basically, the process proposed herein has three steps: (i) the first step involves the homogenization of metal salts in a solution medium (ii) the second step involves the combustion or flame pyrolysis or spray pyrolysis of the aforesaid mixture (this step yields an atomic level homogeneous precursor) and (iii) the third step involves a reduction step yielding the final product.<br>
The final product is superior in glow quality at lower dopant levels and is also cost effective.<br>
Copper doped ZnS is a well known phosphor exhibiting green emission which peaks at 530 nm (nano metres) in the visible region. However, the phosphor is not bright enough for many applications and the glow does not last more than 1-2 hours. In the last few years a new rare earth doped aluminate (oxide) phosphor has been developed which emits at 520 nm (green). The brightness and afterglow of the new phosphor are more than 10 times the best known ZnS based phosphors.<br>
Such phosphor materials are synthesized by conventional ceramic route. This method involves the reaction of two or more solids in the required atmosphere at high temperatures (1300 - 1600 °C) for several hours. The reactions are very slow and require repeated grindings in order to obtain homogeneous end products. In addition, other major disadvantages are the secondary phase formation as well as inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant ions in the crystal lattice of the product.<br><br>
The above inadequacies can be overcome by employing the process proposed herein involving self-propagating high-temperature synthesis or "combustion synthesis". The combustion synthesis process when applied to the preparation of oxide materials typically involves mixing of fuel and solution of metal salts of reactants and combusting the mixture. Since the reactants are mixed in solution at molecular level, this process can yield oxide phosphorescent products with high homogeneity in a short period of time. Alternatively, the solution can be flame pyrolyzed or spray pyrolyzed at high temperatures to obtain the product.<br>
The aluminate compositions synthesized by the process proposed herein are stable. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of single phase crystalline aluminates. Samples exhibit long after-glow lasting for 6-12 hours depending upon the colour and the property is uniform throughout the product. The luminescence intensity of the samples is substantially more than samples synthesized by conventional solid state reaction method.<br>
The process proposed herein has the advantage of shorter cycle time thus increasing throughput and reducing the cost. Due to the uniform distribution of the dopant the process proposed herein calls for lower level of otherwise costly dopant, that is , rare earths, for a comparable after-glow.<br>
The phosphor has the general formula Ax.aMy.bOzR aR b where A is the alkaline earth metal ion (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba or a mixture of them), M is the metal ion chosen from the group consisting of Al, B, Y, Si, Ga or a mixture of them and R1 is the rare earth metal ion, Eu which acts as the activator and R is the rare earth metal ion chosen from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y or a mixture of them which acts as the co-activator.<br>
The starting materials for the preparation of the said afterglow phosphor are selected from the following groups:<br>
Group A:        A group of alkaline earth metal ions consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba or a<br>
mixture of them constituting 2-45% of the weight of the final product.<br><br>
These metal ions are in the form of oxides, hydroxides, oxalates, citrates, nitrates, oxynitrates, tartarates, acetates, carbonates, bicarbonates, a mixture of them or any other soluble salts which do not interfere with the phosphorescent property.<br>
Group B:	A group of rare earth metal ions with Eu as activator which constitutes<br>
0.001-10% of the weight of the final product and another metal ion chosen from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y or a mixture of them as co-activator, constituting 0.001-10% of the weight of the final product. These are in the form of oxides hydroxides, oxalates, citrates, nitrates, oxynitrates, tartarates, acetates, carbonates, bicarbonates, a mixture of them or, any other soluble salts which do not interfere with the phosphorescent property.<br>
Group C:	A group of metal ions consisting of Al, B, Y, Si, Ga or a mixture of<br>
them constituting 2-45% of the weight of the final product. These metal ions can be taken in the form of oxides, hydroxides, oxalates, citrates, nitrates, oxynitrates, tartarates, acetates, carbonates, bicarbonates, a mixture of them or any other soluble salts which do not interfere with the phosphorescent property.<br>
Group D:        The solvent can be water, mineral acid which includes nitric acid and<br>
perchloric acid or a base which includes NH3/NF4OH, glycine or a mixture of them. The weight ratio of the reaction mixture to solvent ranges from 1:0.2 to 1:50.<br>
