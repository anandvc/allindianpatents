The  present   invention  relate    to a  process  for preparing  an  allyl  derivative   of   an   active  hydrogen   containing compound.<br>
Allyl   ether,   throatier  and  amine   compounds   are known  to  be  useful  as  reactive  diluents,   as  unsaturated monomers  or  resins,   and  as   intermediates   for  making epoxy  resins  and  other  downstream  products.     For instance,   EPO  Publication  0  368  421A2   (16-May-90)   has proposed  to  make  epoxy  resins  by:<br>
(1)	reacting  allyl  halide  with  a  polyhydric  phenol   to make  the  poly(allyl   ether)   of   the  polyhydric  phenol; and<br>
(2)	oxidizing  the  allyl   groups   in  the  poly(allyl   ether) to  make  the  poly(glycidyl  ether)   of   the  polyhydric phenol.<br>
Commonly  known  processes   to  make   allyl   ethers are  undesirable  because   they  suffer  from  low  yields  or because  they  produce  halogenated  waste  products  or because  they  need  reagents  which  are  not  readily available.     For  example:<br>
(1)   Japanese  Koki  Heir  5-306246   (published  19-Nov-93)<br>
teaches   to  react  an  allyl  alcohol  with  a  polyhydric phenol   in  the  presence  of  a  palladium  or  platinum catalyst  and  an  organophosphorus   compound.     This process  uses  no  halogenated  materials,   but   suffers from  very  poor  yields  and  poor  catalyst  efficiency.<br><br>
(2)	Great  Britain  Patent  Specification  1,200,730 (published  29-Jul-70)   teaches   the  reaction  of  a nucleophilic  reagent  with  a  vinyl-  or  allyl--carboxylate  in  the  presence  of  a  Group  VIII  metal catalyst.     The  reference  suggests  that  phenols, thiophenols  and  polyamines  may  be  nucleophilic reagents,   but  the  only  actual   examples  use  inorganic and  organic  acids.<br>
(3)	Woo,  U.S.   Patent  4,507,492   (March  26,   1985)   teaches to  react  phenols,   thiophenols  and  arylamines  with allyl  carbonates  in  the  presence  of  a  molybdenum, tungsten  or  Group  VIII  metal  and  triphenyl  phosphine to  make  allyl  ethers.     This  process  uses  allyl carbonates,  which  are  not  readily  available.<br>
(4)	Takahashi  et  al.,   "Palladium-Catalyzed  Exchange  of Allylic  Groups  of  Ethers  and  Esters  With  Active Hydrogen  Compounds  II,"  Vol.   45  J.   Chem.   Soc.   -Japan  230,   234  (1972)   (Table  5)  reports  that  allyl acetate  reacts  with  phenol  in  the  presence  of palladium  dichloride,   triphenylphosphine  and  a catalytic  amount  of  sodium  phenate  at  85Â°C  for<br>
24  hours  to  yield  14  percent  phenyl  allyl  ether.<br>
(5)	J.   Muzart  et  al.,   "'Palladium  Complexes-KF/Alumina'<br>
Catalyzed  Exchange  of  Allylic  Groups  of  Esters  With<br>
Phenol"  Vol.   326  J.   Organometallic  Chem.   C23,   C24<br>
(Table  1)   (1987)  reports  that  allyl  acetate  reacts<br>
with  phenol  in  the  presence  of  palladium  complex  and<br>
an  alumina/KF  support  at  room  temperature  over<br>
24  hours  to  yield  84  percent  phenyl  allyl  ether. The  catalyst   turnover  rate  of   the  reaction  was   1.<br><br>
None  of  these  reactions  produced  a  polyCallyl  ether)   in yields  or  catalyst  efficiencies  high  enough  to   form  a desirable   step  for  commercially-manufacturing  epoxy resins  or  other  downstream  intermediates.<br>
What  is  needed  is  a  practical,   high-yield process  to  make  polyCallyl  ether)   compounds  without  use of  halogenated  intermediates.<br>
The  present  invention  is  a  process   to  make  an allyl  ether,   allyl  thioether  or  allyl  amine  comprising the  step  of  reacting  an  active-hydrogen-containing compound  containing  at  least  one  hydroxyl,   thiol  or primary  or  secondary  amine  group  with  a  compound containing  an  allyl  carboxylate  group  in  the  presence  of a  transition  metal  catalyst,   a  complexing  agent  and  a base;   characterized  in  that  the  quantity  of  base  is  at least  0.8  equivalents  per  equivalent  of  active-hydrogen--containing  compound.<br>
Using  the  present  invention,   the  production  of the  epoxy-containing  compounds  can  be  accomplished efficiently  in  high  yields  in  three  steps  starting  from the  basic  raw  material,   propylene;  whereas  the  prior  art process  involves  four  or  five  steps  starting  from  the basic  raw  material  propylene.     The  three-step  process   is summarized  as  follows:<br>
1)	Propylene  +  oxygen  +  acetic  acid  +  catalyst  	&gt;<br>
allyl  acetate;<br>
2)	Allyl  acetate  +  active-hydrogen-containing  compound<br>
such  as  a  bisphenol  	&gt;  diallyl  derivative  of<br>
active-hydrogen-containing  compound;   and<br><br>
3)     Diallyl  derivative  of  active-hydrogen-containing<br>
compound  +  peroxy  oxidant  	&gt;  diglycidyl  derivative<br>
of  active-hydrogen-containing  compound.<br>
Although  acetic  acid  is   illustrated  above  to  prepare allyl  acetate  which  is  employed  as  the  allylating  agent, it   is  understood  that  other  acids  and  allylating  agents as  enumerated  elsewhere  herein  can  be  employed   in  the process  of  the  present   invention.<br>
The  term  "hydrocarbyl"  as  employed  herein  means any  aliphatic,   cycloaliphatic,   aromatic,   aryl substituted  aliphatic  or  cycloaliphatic,   or  aliphatic  or cycloaliphatic  substituted  aromatic  group.     Likewise, the  term  "hydrocarbyloxy"  means  a  hydrocarbyl  group having  an  oxygen  linkage  between  it  and  the  carbon  atom to  which  it  is  attached.     The  term  "divalent  hydrocarbyl group"  refers  to  the  aforementioned  hydrocarbyl  groups minus  an  additional  hydrogen  atom.<br>
The  term  "catalyst  efficiency"  or  "turnover rate"  is  defined  by  the  following  equation:<br><br>
Catalyst  Efficiency  or Turnover  Rate<br><br>
(Equivalents  of  Active  Hydrogen Converted  Formed)<br>
(Mole  of  Catalyst)/Hour<br><br>
Allyl  Reagent<br>
The  allyl  reagent   is  an  allyl  carboxylate  and most  preferably  is  allyl  acetate.<br>
The  allyl  reagent   is  preferably  employed  in amounts   such  that  the  equivalent  ratio  of  allyl  reagent to  active-hydrogen  atom  contained  in  the  active--hydrogen-containing  compound  is  from  0.1:1   to  500:1,<br><br>
preferably  from  0.5:1   to  50:1  and  more  preferably  from 1:1   to  5:1.     At  ratios   significantly  above   1:1,   the allyl  reagent  performs  as  a  solvent  and  as  a  reactant.<br>
At  ratios  below  0.1:1,   the  conversion  to  the desired  product   is  very  low  and  the  excess  active--hydrogen-containing  reactant  must  be  recovered  and recycled  in  the  process.<br>
The  allyl  carboxylates  from  which  the  allyl derivatives  of  active-hydrogen-containing  compounds  can be  prepared  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,   for example,   those  represented  by  the  following  Formula  I  or any  combination  of  any  two  or  more  such  allyl carboxylates:<br>
Formula  I<br>
0<br>
II R3-4~C-0-CRl2-CRl=CRl2) i<br>
wherein  each  Râ  is  preferably  hydrogen  or  an  alkyl  group having  from  1   to  12  carbon  atoms  which  may  optionally  be linked  to  another  Rl  group  to  form  a  ring  structure, Râ  is  hydrogen  or  an  alkyl,   cycloalkyl  or  aryl   group having  from  1   to  10  carbon  atoms  and  "i"  equals  on average  1   to  3.     Preferably,   the  allyl  carboxylate  is allyl  formate,   allyl  acetate,   allyl  propionate,   allyl benzoate,   and  diallyl  carboxylates  such  as  oxalate, glutarate,   succinate,   or  any  combination  thereof.     Most preferred  as   the  allyl   carboxylate  is  allyl   acetate.<br><br>
Preparation  of  Allyl  Carboxylates<br>
Certain  useful  allyl  carboxylates,   such  as allyl  acetate,   are  commercially  available.     Allyl carboxylates  can  be  prepared  by  the  oxidation  of propylene   in  the  presence  of  oxygen,   a  carboxylic  acid (such  as  formic  acid,   acetic  acid  or  propionic  acid)   and a  palladium  catalyst  as  described  in  U.S.   Patent 3,970,713  which  is  incorporated  herein  by  reference. The  reaction  is  preferably  conducted  at  temperatures  of from  50Â°C  to  250Â°C.     In  the  reaction,   from  5  to  20  moles of  water  per  mole  of  acid,   from  1   to  5  moles  of  oxygen per  mole  of  acid  and  from  4  to  40  moles  of  propylene  per mole  of  oxygen  are  preferably  employed.     This  reaction proceeds  readily  in  one   step  from  the  propylene  to  the allyl  carboxylate  without  the  use  or  production  of halogenated  materials.<br>
Preparation  of  the  Allyl  Derivative  of  Active-Hydrogen--Containing  Compounds<br>
The  allyl  ether,   thioether  or  amine  is  prepared by  reacting  the  allyl  carboxylate  compound  with  an active-hydrogen-containing  compound  in  the  presence  of  a catalyst,   at  least  one  complexing  agent  for  the  catalyst and  at  least  one  base  compound,   and  optionally  but preferably  in  the  presence  of  one  or  more  suitable solvents.<br>
The  reaction  is  preferably  conducted  at  a temperature  of  from  0Â°C  to  200Â°C,  more  preferably  from 25Â°C  to  150Â°C,  more  highly  preferably  from  50Â°C  to 110Â°C,   and  most  preferably  more  than  60Â°C  at  a  pressure sufficient  to  keep  the  reaction  mixture   in  liquid  form. The  reaction  time  to  completion  is  preferably  from<br><br>
).l   to  72  hours,  more  preferably  from  0.1   to  48  hours, mad  most  preferably  from  0.1   to  24  hours.     Optimum :temperature  and  times  for  particular  reactants  will  vary depending  upon  the  reactivity  of  the  particular reactants,   solvents  and  catalysts  employed;   however, such  optimum  temperatures  and  times  can  readily  be letermined  in  the  laboratory  with  minimum  effort.<br>
At  temperatures  below  0Â°C,   the  reaction proceeds  at  a  slower  rate  and  costs  for  cooling  are incurred.<br>
At  temperatures  above  200Â°C,   costs  for iroviding  the  increased  temperature  are  incurred.<br>
Particular  pressures  are  not  deemed  to  be [determinative  of  any  appreciative  effects  on  the â¢recess;  however,   pressures  should  be  employed  which preferably  will  keep  the  reaction  in  the  liquid  phase.<br>
Suitable  allyl  ethers,   thioethers  or  amines 'hatch  can  be  prepared  in  the  process  of  the  present invention  include  but  are  not  limited  to,   for  example, hose  represented  by  any  one  of  the  following ormulas  II  to  IX:<br>

i.  Preparation  of  Bisphenol  A  Diallyl  Ether  From âisphenol  A  and  Allyl  Acetate  Using  a  Heterogeneous i'alladium  Catalyst.<br>
To  a  mixture  of   11.4  g  (0.05  mole)   of jisphenol  A,   0.1   g  of  5  percent  palladium  (0.0469  ramole) )n  charcoal,   0.1  g  (0.38  mmole)   of  triphenyl  phosphine, md  14.5  g  (0.105  mole)   of  potassium  carbonate  in 10  mL  of  isopropanol  under  a  nitrogen  atmosphere  was idded  11.0  g   (1.1  equiv.)   of  allyl  acetate  and  the lixture  stirred  at  85Â°C.     After  4  hours,   both  thin  layer â .hromatography  and  high  performance  liquid chromatography  showed  that  the  reaction  was   practically completed  and  showed  only  one  product  peak.     The catalyst  turnover  rate  was  calculated  to  be )33  equivalent  of  active  hydrogen/mole  of  catalyst/hour.<br><br>
To  the  mixture  prepared  above,   30  mL  of  water and  100  mL  of  ethyl  acetate  were  added.     The  mixture  was shaken  well.     The  mixture  was  filtered  and  the  organic layer  was   separated,   dried  and  concentrated  in  vacuo  at 2  mm  Hg  and  50Â°C  to  yield   15.3  g  of  a  colorless  oil representing  a  yield  of   99.4  percent  based  on bisphenol  A.     Both  infrared  (IR;   with  no  OH  absorption) and  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR;   appearance  of  an appropriate  quantity  of  corresponding  allylic  protons) spectra  were  consistent  with  the  desired  product  of bisphenol  A  diallyl  ether  and  identical   to  a  known sample  of  diallyl  ether  of  bisphenol  A  which  was  derived from  bisphenol  A  and  allyl   chloride.<br>
B.   Epoxidation  of  Bisphenol  A  Diallyl  Ether.<br>
To  a  solution  of  12.5  g  of  diallyl  ether  of bisphenol  A  (40.6  mmole)  and  3.2  g  (7.6  mmole)   of trioctylmethylammonium  nitrate  in  30  mL  of  toluene  was added  an  aqueous   solution  of  2.6  g  of  sodium  tungstate (8.8  mmole),   1.6  g  of  phosphoric  acid  (16.3  mmole)   and 16  g  (about  0.15  mole)   of  30  percent  hydrogen  peroxide in  32  mL  of  water  (final  pH  of  2.05).     The  mixture  was stirred  at  40Â°C  and  high  performance  liquid chromatography  was  used  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the reaction.     After  4  days,   the  reaction  was  stopped  when total  disappearance  of   the  allyl  ether  and  the  formation of  a  new  product  peak  were  observed.     The  aqueous   layer was   separated  and  extracted  twice  with  20  mL  portions   of toluene.     The  organic  reaction  mixture  was   combined  with the  extracts,  washed  twice  with  30  mL  portions  of  water, and  dried  over  magnesium  sulfate  and  then  concentrated in  vacuo  resulting  in  17.0  g  of  a  brown  oil.<br><br>
This   crude  brown  oil  was  passed   through  a column  of  250  g  of  silica  gel  packed  in  20  percent  of acetone  in  hexane.     Elution  of  this  column  with  a gradient  of  20  to  50  percent  acetone  in  hexane  yielded 9.5  g  of  a  light  yellow  oil.     Spectral  data   (IR  and  NMR; NMR:   absence  of  olefinic  protons  and  appearance  of epoxide  protons)  were  consistent  with  the  desired product   (the  diglycidyl  ether  of  bisphenol  A). Furthermore,   both  thin  layer  chromatography  and  high performance  liquid  chromatography  showed  identical retention  times  with  a  known  sample  of  diglycidyl  ether of  bisphenol  A.     Analysis  showed  that  the  product obtained  contained  26  ppm  of  total  chloride  and  had  an epoxy  equivalent  weight  of   182.<br>

Preparation  of  Bisphenol  A  Diallyl  Ether  From  Bisphenol A  and  Allyl  Acetate  Using  Homogeneous  Palladium  Catalyst<br>
To  a  glass  reactor  equipped  with  glass  baffles under  a  nitrogen  atmosphere  was  added  a  solution  of 35.0  g  (0.875  mol)  of  sodium  hydroxide  in  300  mL  of water.     Then  40  g  of  dry  ice  was  gradually  added  until  a pH  of  10.5  was  obtained.     Then  45.6  g  (0.2  mole)  of bisphenol  A  was  added.     After  stirring  for  20  minutes, the  mixture  was  heated  to  85Â°C  and  80.0  g  (0.8  mole)   of allyl  acetate,   0.028  g   (0.125  mmole)  of  palladium acetate  and  0.162  g  (0.617  mmole)   of  triphenyl  phosphine were  added.     After  stirring  rapidly  (about  600  rpra)   for 15  minutes,   the  reaction  was  &gt;99  percent  complete  and the  high  performance  liquid  chromatogram  showed  cleanly one  product  peak.     The   stirring  was   stopped  and  the organic  layer  was   separated  and  concentrated  in  vacuo  to yield  58.61   g  of  desired  product.     The  yield  was<br><br>
95.2  percent.     The  catalyst  turnover  rate  was   calculated to  be  12,800/hour.<br>
Repeating  the  above  example  using  a  stirring rate  of  60  rpm  instead  of  600  rpm  the  conversion  was only  14.4  percent  after   15  minutes.<br>

A.   Preparation  of  Allyl  Phenolic  Novolac<br>
To  a  mixture  of  6.2  g  (20  mmole)   of  cresol novolac  (average  molecular  weight  =  310,   hydroxy equivalent  weight  =  124,   average  functionality  =  2.5), 8.0  g  (57.9  mmole)  of  potassium  carbonate,   50  mg  of 5  percent  palladium  (0.024  mmole)   on  charcoal,   and  20  mg (0.08  mmole)  of  triphenyl  phosphine  in  25  mL  of isopropanol,  was   slowly  added  6.0  g  (60  mmole)   of  allyl acetate.     After  the  resultant  mixture  was  stirred  at 85Â°C  for  8  hours,  high  performance  liquid  chromatography showed  that  the  reaction  was  complete.     Water  (30  mL) and  toluene  (30  mL)  were  added  to  the  mixture.     After extracting,   the  toluene  layer  was  separated  and  the aqueous  layer  was  again  extracted  with  another  30  mL  of toluene.     After  separation,   the  toluene  extracts  were combined,   dried  over  magnesium  sulfate  and  concentrated in  vacuo  to  a  viscous  pale  yellow  oil   (7.8  g,   95  percent yield).     Spectral  data  of  this  material  were  consistent with  the  desired  allylated  product.     The  NMR  spectrum showed  the  presence  of  the  vinylic-H  and  the  allylic--hydrogens  while  the  IR  spectrum  showed  the  absence  of OH  absorption.<br><br>
B.   Epoxidation  of  Allyl  Phenol  Novolac<br>
An  aqueous  solution  containing  2.65  g   (8  mmole) of  sodium  tungstate  dihydrate,   1.6  g  (16  mmole)   of phosphoric  acid  and  8.0  g  (0.165  mole)   of  70  percent hydrogen  peroxide  in  28  mL  of  water   (mixture  pH  =  2.05) was  added  to  a  24  mL  toluene  solution  containing  12.6  g (0.1  equiv.)   of  allylated  cresol  novolac  prepared  in  A above  and  1.6  g  (4.5  mmole)  of  trioctylmethylammonium nitrate.     The  mixture  was   stirred  at  45Â°C  for  28  hours and  was  stopped  when  almost  all  starting  material  had disappeared.     The  mixture  was  cooled  and  the  organic layer  separated  and  washed  3  times  with  50  mL  of  water. It  was  then  dried  over  magnesium  sulfate,   filtered  and concentrated  in  vacuo  to  give  13.6  g  of  a  viscous  amber liquid.<br>
To  remove  the  ammonium  nitrate  from  the  crude product,   the  material  was  extracted  with  5  mL  of methanol  by  warming  up  with  stirring,   cooling  to  room temperature  and  decanting  the  extracting  methanol.     The process  was  repeated  four  times.     The  product  was   then concentrated  with  roto-evaporator  (

A  mixture  of  benzyl  alcohol   (10.8  g,   0.1  mole), allyl  acetate   (10.5  g,   0.105  mole)  and  potassium carbonate   (15  g,   0.109  mole)   in  15  mL  of  water  was stirred  under  nitrogen  for   15  minutes.     Then  10  mg (0.045  mmole)   of  palladium  acetate  and  30  mg<br><br>
(0.115  mmole)   of  triphenyl   phosphine  were  added  and  the mixture  was  stirred  at  85Â°C.     After  48  hours,   the reaction  was  65  percent  completed,   and  the  reaction  rate became  quite  sluggish.     After  cooling,   50  mL  of  water and  50  mL  of  toluene  were  added  for  extraction.     The organic  extract  was   separated  and  washed  twice  with 30  mL  of  water,   dried  over  magnesium  sulfate  and concentrated  in  vacuo  yielding  14.2  g.     This   light  brown liquid  was  distilled  and  collected  at  71Â°C  to  74Â°C/13  ram Hg,   yielding  8.5  g  of  a  colorless  liquid  (NMR  and IR  spectra  were  consistent  with  the  desired  benzyl  allyl ether).<br>

The  mixture  was  stirred  at  45Â°C  for  36  hours and  was  stopped  when  almost  all   starting  material  had disappeared.     The  mixture  was  cooled  and  the  organic layer  was  separated  and  washed  three  times  with  50  mL  of water.     It  was  then  dried  over  magnesium  sulfate, filtered  and  concentrated  in  vacuo  to  give   12.2  g  of  a viscous  amber  liquid.<br>
To  remove  the  ammonium  nitrate  from  the  crude product,   the  material  was  chromatographed  over  200  g  of silica  gel  packed  in  10  percent  acetone  in  hexane. Elution  of  this  column  with  a  gradient  of   10  to 20  percent  acetone/hexane  yielded  8.2  g  of  material<br><br>
