Device for checking the end positions of movable parts of a<br>
railway switch<br>
The invention relates to a device for checking the end positions<br>
of movable parts of a railway switch, in which at least one<br>
separate end-position checking device is assigned to each<br>
movable switch part, wherein the end-position checking device<br>
includes a rod and a checker housing in which the rod is<br>
inserted and in which at least one limit switch is arranged to<br>
detect the two end positions of the movable switch part.<br>
Operating devices for movable switch parts such as, in<br>
particular, tongue rails or movable frogs, which are provided<br>
with end position checking devices are generally known as<br>
belonging to the prior art. In those known switch setting<br>
devices, the mechanical setting of a movable switch part is<br>
effected by the aid of an electric or hydraulic switch actuator,<br>
wherein a separate locking device, or a locking device<br>
integrated in the switch actuator, as well as, in any event, a<br>
separate end-position checking device are provided besides the<br>
switch actuator. Such end-position checking devices serve to<br>
mechanically scan in railway switches the current state of a<br>
switch, and to generate a check signal to reliably determine<br>
whether the switch has been set correctly and whether the closed<br>
tongue and the open tongue are in their respectively correct end<br>
positions. The end-position checking device comprises a check<br>
rod assembly extending substantially transverse to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the rails and which is displaced in<br>
the longitudinal direction of the rod assembly at a change-over<br>
of the switch. The positions of the checker rods are detected by<br>
the aid of electromechanical transducers formed, for instance,<br>
by limit switches or tongue checking pads, which are arranged in<br>
housings usually mounted (laterally) on a sleeper of the railway<br>
switch.<br><br>
2<br>
In addition to the configuration as a separate device, an end<br>
position checker also has already been integrated in a common<br>
housing with the switching drive. Another embodiment has become<br>
known from DE 29917829 U1, in which a throughgoing checker rod<br>
is provided, the two rod sections of which are telescopically<br>
guided within each other with a spring element being interposed.<br>
The end-position contact switches in that case are designed as<br>
switching fingers rigidly connected with the checker rod and<br>
cooperating with proximity switches. Alternatively, solutions<br>
are known, where grooves are provided in the checker rod for the<br>
engagement of switch levers, which will thereby enable the<br>
triggering of the limit switch. An example in this context is US<br>
5,669,587.<br>
In the above-described end-position checking devices, a common<br>
checker rod is assigned to both tongue rails of a switch such<br>
that the end positions of both tongue rails can be checked by a<br>
single device. However, end-position checking devices in which<br>
each tongue rail is associated with a separate end-position<br>
checking device have already been known too, so that an<br>
increased mechanical safety is reached by the complete<br>
mechanical decoupling of the two checking devices each assigned<br>
to a single tongue rail. In this respect, it is, for instance,<br>
referred to DE 1963464 U. In that device, a separate switch rod<br>
each abuts on one switch tongue under the action of a pressure<br>
spring, with a limit switch arranged within a housing being<br>
actuated as a function of the switch position. By the rod being<br>
resiliently pressed at the switch tongue, a play-free<br>
transmission of the movement of the switch tongue to the<br>
checking device is ensured so as to enable the precise detection<br>
of the respective end positions. However, such a device involves<br>
the disadvantage that an adaptation of the end-position checking<br>
device to different setting strokes is feasible only with<br><br>
3<br>
considerable difficulties, i.e., only by opening the checker<br>
housing and changing the position of the actuating members for<br>
the limit switches relative to the limit switches.<br>
With modern railway switches, it is necessary to arrange a<br>
plurality of end-position checking devices along the<br>
longitudinal direction of the switch in order to be able to<br>
check the correct assumption of the respective end positions on<br>
a plurality of points. In this manner, a break of the railway<br>
switch or bulging of the same or any other malfunctioning will<br>
be more readily detected. If a plurality of end-position<br>
checking devices is to be arranged along a railway switch, each<br>
of the checking devices has to be adapted to a different setting<br>
stroke, wherein near the point of fixation of the tongue rail a<br>
setting stroke is observed that is smaller than on the free end<br>
of the tongue rail, where the maximum setting stroke occurs.<br>
The present invention aims to provide an end-position checking<br>
device which renders feasible in a simple manner the adaptation<br>
to the different displacement paths, of movable switch parts<br>
without involving complex modification operations and, in<br>
particular, having to open the checker housing. The adaptation<br>
to different displacement paths is to be feasible even in the<br>
installed state of the end-position checking device, for<br>
instance, in order to enable a subsequent adaptation to changes<br>
in the setting stroke due to operation-inherent wear phenomena.<br>
To solve this object, the device according to the invention is<br>
substantially configured in a manner that the rod in its portion<br>
reaching into the housing, or the housing, comprises at least<br>
two axially spaced-apart switching flanks for the actuation of<br>
said at least one limit switch, wherein at least one of said<br>
switching flanks is arranged to be axially displaceable relative<br>
to the other of said switching flanks and fixable in the<br><br>
4<br>
respective position. By providing at least two axially spaced-<br>
apart switching flanks for the actuation of the limit<br>
switch(es), it is rendered feasible to carry out an adaptation<br>
to different displacement paths of the tongue rail by changing<br>
the axial distance between the two switching flanks. To this<br>
end, at least one of the switching flanks is arranged to be<br>
displaceable in the axial direction relative to the other<br>
switching flank and fixable in the respective position. This<br>
will, in particular, be of advantage if a separate end-position<br>
checking device is assigned to every tongue rail, so that the<br>
adaptation to different displacement paths can be separately<br>
effected for every tongue rail. On account of the possibility to<br>
precisely adjust the checking device, already slight deviations<br>
from the end position will prevent the actuation of the limit<br>
switch such that the respective malfunctioning will be<br>
immediately apparent at the control point.<br>
The reliable functioning of the end-position checking device<br>
will only be safeguarded, if the perfect guidance of the checker<br>
rod within the housing is ensured. The end-position checking<br>
device, however, is mostly subjected to mechanical loads, for<br>
instance by the effect of vibrations transmitted from the tongue<br>
rail to the checking device, by thermal stresses or by bending<br>
or torsional moments. It is, therefore, provided in a preferred<br>
manner that the housing is configured as a tube having a<br>
circular cross section, into which the rod is sealingly<br>
inserted. On account of the circular cross section of the<br>
housing, the functionability of the end-position checking device<br>
will not be impaired even under torsional loads or at a torsion<br>
of the checker rod assembly and, in particular, checker rod,<br>
whereby the tight closure of the checker housing will in any<br>
event be maintained in the region of insertion of the checker<br>
rod in the checker housing on account of the circular<br>
configuration. Such a configuration, moreover, ensures a<br><br>
5<br>
particularly compact mode of construction so as to be able to<br>
take into account, in the optimum manner, the limited space<br>
conditions available in the region of a switch tongue.<br>
As a rule, the rod-shaped structural part in end-position<br>
checking devices is designed as a checker rod coupled with the<br>
movable switch part and inserted in a stationary housing,<br>
wherein the limit switches are rigidly connected with the<br>
stationary housing. As a variation, it is provided according to<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention that the rod is<br>
connected with a stationary part of the switch and the tube is<br>
coupled to the movable part, which will be of particular<br>
advantage, if, as in correspondence with a further preferred<br>
embodiment, the at least one limit switch is connected with the<br>
rod and capable of being actuated by the switching flanks<br>
arranged on the inner jacket of the tube. Hence, a particularly<br>
compact mode of construction will be obtained. The switching<br>
flanks for the actuation of the limit switches in this<br>
embodiment are, thus, arranged on the movable housing so as to<br>
cooperate with the limit switches arranged on the rod connected<br>
with a stationary part of the railway switch. With such a<br>
configuration, the axial displacement of the switching flanks<br>
provided in the tube, for the adjustment of the distance between<br>
the two switching flanks and, hence, the adaptation to the<br>
respective setting stroke is substantially facilitated, wherein<br>
it is provided in a preferred manner that switching grooves<br>
defined by the switching flanks are formed on the inner jacket<br>
of the tube. The limit switches are, thus, able to engage in<br>
such switching grooves as the respective end position is<br>
reached, wherein it is preferably provided for the adjustment of<br>
the distance between the switching grooves that at least one of<br>
the switching flanks is formed on a structural component that is<br>
axially displaceable relative to the tube. The displaceable<br>
structural component in this case may be designed as an inner<br><br>
6<br>
tube capable of being screwed into the tube so as to enable a<br>
displacement of the switching flank in the axial direction by<br>
rotating the inner tube relative to the housing tube. With such<br>
a configuration, the adjustment of the switching flanks and,<br>
hence, the adaptation to the respective setting stroke can also<br>
be effected with an already installed end-position checking<br>
device without having to open the housing, since only the<br>
housing tube, which is accessible from outside, need be rotated<br>
relative to the inner tube.<br>
In a preferred manner, the at least one limit switch comprises a<br>
spring-loaded tappet, or cooperates with a spring-loaded<br>
actuating member, which, with the movable switch part assuming<br>
the correct end position, engages in the switching groove<br>
defined by the switching flank. Due to the spring-loaded tappet,<br>
or the spring-loaded actuating member, it is ensured that the<br>
tappet or actuating member, respectively, acts against the<br>
enveloping tube in a manner that a compulsive actuation of the<br>
change-over switch will always occur, if the tongue rail has not<br>
yet reached the required end position. It is only when reaching<br>
the end position, that the spring-loaded tappet, or the spring-<br>
loaded actuating member, will engage in the respective switching<br>
groove arranged on the inner circumference of the enveloping<br>
tube. To increase the safety, at least two limit switches are<br>
preferably provided, each of the limit switches being actuatable<br>
by an associated switching flank. With the appropriate<br>
connection of the two limit switches, the reliable control of<br>
the correct assumption of the respective end position will be<br>
ensured.<br>
The coupling of the end-position checking device to the movable<br>
railway switch part in a preferred manner is effected in that<br>
the tube, or the inner tube, comprises a connection site for a<br>
connection piece for coupling to the movable switch part. In<br><br>
7<br>
order to ensure that merely the forces acting in the direction<br>
of the switching movement are transmitted to the end-position<br>
checking device and the end-position checking device is kept<br>
free of any other forces caused, for instance, by longitudinal<br>
displacements, thermal expansions or tilting of the tongue rail,<br>
it is preferably provided that the tube is connected with the<br>
movable switch part so as to be displaceable in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the rail. It may, moreover, be provided that the<br>
tube is connected to the movable switch part so as to be<br>
pivotable about an axis extending parallel with the longitudinal<br>
axis of the rail. The pivotal mounting may be realized using<br>
elastic connecting members and/or spherical bearings such that<br>
vibrations of the tongue rails will be balanced rather than<br>
transmitted to the checking device. Actuations of the limit<br>
switches exclusively on grounds of such vibrations are, thus,<br>
excluded, so that the reliability of the checking device will be<br>
enhanced. Tilting moments or the like acting on the movable<br>
switch parts when running over a switch are likewise taken up by<br>
the joint or elastic connecting member due to the pivotability<br>
of the checking device.<br>
In order to further enhance the usability of the end-position<br>
checking device on various points along a railway switch, the<br>
configuration is advantageously further developed in a manner<br>
that the rod is connected with a sliding block which is capable<br>
of being displaced in the axial direction relative to a<br>
stationary bearing pedestal. It is thereby feasible to displace<br>
the entire end-position checking device in a direction<br>
transverse to the longitudinal direction of the rail so as to<br>
ensure the improved adaptation to various setting strokes. In<br>
particular, it is thereby feasible to arrange one and the same<br>
end-position checking device on different points along a switch,<br>
with the effective length of the checker rod assembly being<br>
adjustable on account of the axial displaceability of the end-<br><br>
8<br>
position checking device. The displaceability may readily be<br>
obtained in that the stationary bearing pedestal carries a<br>
spindle extending transverse to the longitudinal direction of<br>
the rail and cooperating with an internal thread of the sliding<br>
block. By rotating the spindle, an accordingly infinitely<br>
variable axial displacement of the checker rod assembly is,<br>
thus, feasible.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in more detail<br>
by way of an exemplary embodiment schematically illustrated in<br>
the drawing. Therein:<br>

device along line VI-VI of Fig. 4;<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view along line VII-VII of Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 8 is an illustration analogous to Fig. 7, of a modified<br>
configuration.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a section of a railway switch including stock<br>
rails 1 and 2 as well as tongue rails 3 and 4. The tongue rail 3<br>
in this case abuts on the stock rail 1, tongue rail 4 is in a<br>
position not abuting on the stock rail 2. The tongue rails 3 and<br>
4 are each assigned a separate end-position checking device 5<br>
and 6, respectively, so as to ensure the complete mechanical<br><br>
9<br>
decoupling of the tongue rails 3 and 4. The end-position<br>
checking devices 5 and 6 are each fixed to a sleeper 15 via a<br>
bearing pedestal 7. The end position checking devices are each<br>
comprised of a rod 8 which is sealingly inserted in a tubular<br>
housing 9, the tube 9 being coupled to the tongue rail 3 and 4,<br>
respectively, via an articulated fork head 10. When operating a<br>
switch along double arrow 11, the tube 9, which is coupled to<br>
the tongue rail, is carried along and displaced relative to the<br>
rod 8, whereby, as will be explained below, limit switches are<br>
actuated as a function of the relative displacement position of<br>
the tube 9 in respect to the rod 8. In the detailed illustration<br>
according to Fig. 2, the connection of the end-position checking<br>
device with the sleeper 15 is shown. A bearing pedestal 7<br>
carrying a spindle 12 is connected with the sleeper 15. The<br>
spindle 12 is provided with an external thread which cooperates<br>
with an internal thread provided in a bore of the sliding block<br>
13 so as to enable a displacement of the sliding block 13 in the<br>
sense of double arrow 14 by rotating the spindle 12. The end<br>
piece 16 connected with the rod 8 is articulately connected with<br>
the sliding block 13 about an axis 17 so as to prevent possible<br>
tilting moments from being transmitted to the end-position<br>
checking device.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts in detail the coupling of the end-position<br>
checking device to the movable tongue rail. As is also apparent<br>
from the illustration according to Fig. 4, an articulated fork<br>
head 10 carrying a pin 18 is provided in a manner that the tube<br>
9 is coupled to the tongue rail so as to be pivotable about an<br>
axis 19. The fork head 10 embraces the foot of the tongue rail<br>
and is fixed to the rail web by a screw connection. A holding<br>
plate 20 serves to fix the position of the end-position checking<br>
device in the longitudinal direction of the rail by being<br>
laterally supported on the sliding chair 38. This configuration<br>
prevents any longitudinal expansion of the rail from being<br><br>
10<br>
transmitted to the checking device. The holding plate 20 further<br>
includes a vertically oriented longhole, which is not visible in<br>
the Figure and by which the fork head 10 is relieved of vertical<br>
forces.<br>
The mode of functioning of the end-position checking device will<br>
now be explained in more detail by way of the sectional<br>
illustration according to Fig. 6. The rod 8, which is rigidly<br>
connected with the end piece 16, carries two limit switches 21<br>
and 22 on its end that is inserted in the tube. The actuating<br>
mechanism for the limit switches is comprised of two switching<br>
tappets 23 which are arranged symmetrically to the central axis,<br>
resiliently biased relative to each other and outwardly pressed<br>
against the inner jacket 24 of the tube 9. On their mutually<br>
facing sides, the switching tappets 23 cooperate with a<br>
switching cone 25 which acts directly on the actuating tappet 26<br>
of the limit switch. The limit switch is actuated as long as the<br>
switching tappet 23 is in the radially inwardly maintained<br>
position, which is the case with the limit switch 21 in the<br>
situation represented in the Figure. In the event of the limit<br>
switch 22, the switching tappets 27 are, by contrast,<br>
illustrated in the radially outwardly shifted position, engaging<br>
in a switching groove 28 and, hence, preventing the limit switch<br>
22 from being further actuated. On the inner circumference of<br>
the tube 9, beside the switching groove 28, is provided a<br>
further switching groove 29 into which the switching tappets 23<br>
of the limit switch 21 can engage at a respective setting of the<br>
switch.<br>
During the setting procedure of the switch, the tube 9 and inner<br>
tube 31 coupled to the tongue rail are displaced in the sense of<br>
arrow 30, departing from the position illustrated in the<br>
drawing, thus causing a displacement of the switching grooves<br>
relative to the limit switches. In doing so, the switching<br><br>
11<br>
tappets 27 are pressed radially inwardly against the force of<br>
springs 37, emerging from the switching groove 28. During the<br>
setting procedure, both the actuating tappets 23 of the limit<br>
switch 21 and the actuating tappets 27 of the limit switch 22<br>
are, therefore, in the radially inwardly pressed position such<br>
that both of the limit switches 21 and 22 are actuated. At the<br>
end of the setting procedure, the actuating tappets 23 engage in<br>
the switching groove 29, which indicates that the correct end<br>
position has been reached. An adaptation to the respective<br>
setting stroke is then effected by a change of the distance<br>
between the switching grooves 28 and 29. The smaller the setting<br>
stroke, the larger the distance between the switching grooves 28<br>
and 29 has to be chosen. To enable the axial displacement of the<br>
switching groove 28, the latter is formed on a separate<br>
structural component, namely the inner tube 31, which is screwed<br>
into the tube 9. By rotating the tube 9 relative to the inner<br>
tube 31, an infinitely variable adjustment of the distance<br>
between the switching grooves 28 and 29 occurs. The respectively<br>
selected rotated position is fixed by the aid of a securing nut<br>
33. The inner tube 31 comprises a projecting end section 32 into<br>
whose annular groove the holding plate 20 engages.<br>
From Fig. 7 it is apparent that the tight mounting of the rod 8<br>
within the tube 9 is ensured by an overlapping part 34 which is<br>
screwed on the tube end facing the rod and carries appropriate<br>
seals 35 for the tight guidance of the rod 8. The rod 8 is<br>
further connected with a support element 36 to which the end-<br>
position contact switches 21 and 22 are fixed. The illustration<br>
according to Fig. 8 depicts a modified configuration, in which a<br>
total of four end-position contact switches are connected with<br>
the support-like structural part 36. In this case, two switches<br>
are provided for each end position, which are each switched by a<br>
common actuating mechanism. This allows for the achievement of<br>
an enhanced checking security.<br><br>
