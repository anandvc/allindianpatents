				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to Multi Function Peripheral devices (MFP). MFP is the device &gt;vhich can perform multiple functions such as copy, fax, printing and Network related operations like Email, Network Scan etc. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for sending a copy of a fax from an MFP device to a computer connected through a network for continuous monitoring.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In one of the US Patent No. 5,528,385 titled "Fax modem with Scanning Capability* describes a method for interfacing a facsimile machine with a host computer. This patent provides for scanning documents into the host computer. Here a document is scanned into the host computer through the facsimile machine and transmitted through a common telephone line that is shared between the host computer and the facsimile machine. It also provides for normal fax operations to and from remote locations, in addition to scanning of the documents into the computer. However, it does not describe any means for reducing PSTN charges, and scanning the document to a computer connected through a network.<br>
Another US Patent No. 6157464 titled "Facsimile Store and Forward System with Local Interface" provides for various services and a method to communicate with a remotely located facsimile facility. However, this does not provide any means for reducing PSTN charges.<br>
In another US Patent No. 6,075,849 titled "Method of Monitoring a Data Transmission" describes a method of monitoring data transmitted by a facsimile machine through a telephone line and maintaining the statistics of the data transmission. However, the patent publication does not mention that a copy of the data is sent to a computer connected to the facsimile machine.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for sending a copy of a fax from a Multi- Functional Peripheral (MFP) device to a computer connected through a network for monitoring purposes. The invention intends to reduce the additional telephone charges incurred during this data transmission by using Local Area Network instead of PSTN. The invention thus provides a means for continuous monitoring of the MFP usage through the network. The system comprises a fax-to-network scan handler and a fax-to-network scan configuration module. After receiving fax data, the fax-to-network scan handler sends the fax data to a pre-configured network computer, which is defined by the fax-to-network scan configuration module. The facsimile machine performs a required action only if the fax data is received by the network computer. The invention also describes a method in which the MFP transmits data, only after the data has been successfully sent to the network computer.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention explains a method for sending a copy of a fax from a Multi-Functional Peripheral (MFP) device to a computer connected through a network for continuous monitoring of the said MFP usage comprising the steps of:<br>
checking the operation mode of the device whether it is in transmission mode(TX operation) or in the receiving mode(RX operation), where the TX operation involves:<br>
(i)	dialing the destination fax number;<br>
(ii)	scanning the required document;<br>
(iii)	sending the scanned data to a pre-configured network PC where a program is running to receive the data; <br>
ir<br>
(iv)	sending the fax to the dialed number if the scanned data is send successfully to the networked PC; and<br>
(v)	discarding the fax if data is not sent successfully to network PC, wherein the RX operation involves:<br>
(a)	receiving the fax from the sending machine;<br>
(b)	storing the fax in the memory of the MFP;<br>
(c)	sending the stored data to a pre-configured network PC where a program is running to receive the data;<br>
(d)	printing the fax if data is sent successfully to the PC; and<br>
(e)	discarding the fax if data is not sent successfully to network PC.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of an embodiment of the invention given as a non- restrictive example only and represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>

However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the prior art. First the status of operation is checked to confirm whether it is in transmitting mode or in receiving mode. In the TX operation the document is loaded in the scanner first. Then the fax number of destination machine is dialed and after that the scanning of the document starts. After this the scanned data is send to the configured fax number. This is exclusively done through the PSTN line. If the configured number is correct the fax is send to dialed number. If the configured number is incorrect then the Fax is discarded, in the RX mode first the fax is received from another machine. The received fax data is send to a configured fax number which is intended to receive the data. Printing of the fax is done if data is sent successfully to the configured fax and if data could not be sent successfully to the fax then it is discarded.<br>
Figure 2 shows the flow chart of the present invention. First the status of operation is checked to confirm whether it is in transmitting mode or in receiving mode. In the TX operation the document is loaded in the scanner first Then the fax number of destination machine is dialed and after that the scanning of the document starts. After this the scanned data is send to a pre-configured network PC where a program is running to receive the data. If data is sent successfully to the PC then the fax is send to dialed number. If data is not sent successfully to network PC then the Fax is discarded. In the RX mode first the fax is received from another machine. Then the fax data is stored into the memory of the MFP. The received fax data is send to a pre-configured network PC where a program is running to receive the data. Printing of the fax is done (Printing may be optional and can be configured) if data is sent successfully to the PC and if data could not be sent successfully to network PC the fax is discarded.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
There are two scenarios for current invention functions as given below: Fax Transmission (Fax TX):<br>
First the document is loaded in the scanner. Then the fax number of destination machine is dialed and after that the scanning of the document starts. After this the scanned data is send to a pre-configured network PC where a program is running to receive the data. If data is sent successfully to the PC then the fax is sent to dialed number. If data is not sent successfully to network PC then the Fax is discarded.<br>
Fax Reception (Fax RX):<br>
First the fax is received from another machine. Then the fox data is stored into the memory of the MFP. The received fax data is send to a pre-configured network PC where a program is running to receive the data. Printing of the fax is done (Printing may be optional and can be configured) if data is sent successfully to the PC and if data could not be sent successfully to network PC the fox is discarded.<br>
