				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A THREE - DIMENSIONAL BATTERY WITH AN ELECTRODE<br>
STRUCTURE, AND A METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to an electrode structure of a three-dimensional<br>
battery constructed by the filling of an active material in powder, particle, plate and<br>
the like form and to its producing method. The present invention further relates to a<br>
high power type three-dimensional battery which is based on a bellows-shaped unit<br>
and which is capable of increasing its size easily.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The present invention relates to a three-dimensional battery. The<br>
problems to be solved by the present invention is classified into the following<br>
problems in view of prior arts.<br>
A first problem is to provide a three-dimensional battery which requires a<br>
less number of component parts than conventional and which reduces assembly<br>
time and assembly cost. Additionally, the first problem is to provide an electrode<br>
structure of the three-dimensional battery and a method for producing an electrode<br>
material of the three-dimensional battery. Furthermore, the first problem is to<br>
provide, at low cost, a three-dimensional battery which has a large current collecting<br>
area and which is capable of charging and discharging at high rate.<br>
A second problem is to provide a high power type three-dimensional<br>
battery capable of increasing its size easily and generating high output power<br>
without undergoing a drop in performance due to the increase in size.<br>
Hereinafter, the first and second probelems will be discussed in order by<br>
comparison with prior arts.'<br>
1. PRIOR ART AND FIRST PROBLEM<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 3051401 discloses a so-called<br>
three-dimensional battery comprising an active material in powder or particle form.<br><br>
Additionally, International Publication WO 00/59062 discloses a layered<br>
three-dimensional battery. Furthermore, a three-dimensional battery in which a<br>
particulate active material is filled as a fixed layer is disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Provisional Publication No 2002-141101 and Japanese Patent Provisional<br>
Publication No. 2002-141104. When producing such three-dimensional battery, a<br>
separator and a current collector have been preassembled in a given order to<br>
complete a cell and, then, the cell has been filled with an active material in powder,<br>
particle or the like form.<br>
However, when producing a three-dimensional battery by the use of a<br>
method in which a cell, into which a separator and a current collector have been<br>
preassembled, is filled with an active material, there is a possibility that it becomes<br>
difficult to carry out the filling of a cell with an active material. Besides, when<br>
assembling component parts necessary for the assembly of a battery in order, the<br>
number of component parts, such as a current collector, a cell, an active material, a<br>
separator and the like, increases, therefore making the work of assembly extremely<br>
complicated. Accordingly, assembly time and assembly cost will increase.<br>
In addition to the above, the current collecting area of a three-dimensional<br>
battery that employs only a planar current collector is relatively narrow, therefore<br>
presenting the problem that there occurs a drop in battery performance when<br>
carrying out charging and discharging at high rate (high current charging and<br>
discharging).<br>
In view of the above-described drawbacks, the present invention has been<br>
devised. Accordingly, the first problem to be solved by the present invention is to<br>
provide a three-dimensional battery, an electrode structue of the three-dimensional<br>
battery, and a method for producing an electrode material of the three-dimensional<br>
battery. More specifically, by virtue of the present invention, the number of<br>
component parts required at the time of battery assembly, the assembly time, and<br>
the assembly costs are all reduced by simultaneous formation by combination of an<br>
active material with at least one of a separator, a dividing wall, and a current<br>
collector when producing the electrode of the three-dimensional battery.<br>
Additionally, the first problem to be solved by the present invention is to<br>
provide an electrdoe structure of the three-dimensional battery and a method for<br><br>
producing an electrode material of the three-dimensional battery. More specifically,<br>
by virtue of the present invention, is achieved the increase in current collecting area<br>
by forming projected portions in needle, plate, wave, particle, or the like form on the<br>
constituent components of the three-dimensional battery such as a dividing wall and<br>
a current collector, thereby making it possible to carry out charging and discharging<br>
at high rate (high current charging and discharging).<br>
Finally, the first problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide<br>
an electrode structue of the three-dimensional battery and a method for producing<br>
an electrode material of the three-dimensional battery. More specifically, by virtue<br>
of the present invention, it becomes possible to provide an increased current<br>
collecting area by the use of an ion permeable current collector having therein<br>
voids, thereby making it possible to carry out charging and discharging at high rate<br>
(high current charging and discharging).<br>
2. PRIOR ART AND SECOND PROBLEM<br>
As described above, Japanese Patent Publication No. 3052401 discloses<br>
a so-called three-dimensional battery comprising a powdered or particulate active<br>
material. International Publication WO 00/59062 discloses a layered<br>
three-dimensional battery. A three-dimensional battery in which a particulate active<br>
material is filled for formation of a fixed layer is disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Provisional Publication No.2002-141101 and Japanese Patent Provisional<br>
Publication No. 2002-141104.<br>
In a nickel-hydrogen secondary battery of the conventional structure, nickel<br>
hydroxide which serves as a cathode of the nickel-hydrogen secondary battery does<br>
not have electrical conductivity. To cope with this, the surface of the nickel<br>
hydroxide is coated with a cobalt compound which is electrically conductivity. This<br>
is filled into a foamed nickel sheet for the purpose of shape support and electrical<br>
conduction. Since it is impossible to achieve adhesive joining of the foamed nickel<br>
sheet and the nickel hydroxide in an alkali electrolytic solution, separation is<br>
prevented by application of physical pressure from the outside. Additionally, in<br>
order to reduce the degree of electrical resistance between the foamed nickel sheet<br>
and the nickel hydroxide, it is required that the foamed nickel sheet be reduced in<br>
thickness. To this end, a foamed nickel sheet having a thickness of about 1.1 mm,<br><br>
into which paste -like nickel hydroxide has been filled, is so compacted as to have a<br>
thickness of about 0.6 mm. Additionally, in order to obtain smooth ion diffusion, the<br>
distance between the cathode and the anode should be as small as possible.<br>
Therefore, the thickness of battery structure comprising the cathode, the separator<br>
and the anode does not exceed 2 mm.<br>
For the case of nickel-hydrogen secondary batteries of the conventional<br>
structure, there is no other way, indeed, in order to achieve the increase in size<br>
while meeting the above-described requirements, than to increase the area of the<br>
cathode and the anode without changing the thickness of the foamed nickel sheet.<br>
However, there is the limit of increasing the area per sheet. To cope with such<br>
limitation, the number of foamed nickel sheets is increased and multiple foamed<br>
nickel sheets are connected. In this case, welding connection of conducting wires<br>
(nickel plates or the like) is employed as a connecting technique, which, however,<br>
results in the increase in electrical resistance. Accordingly, the performance of the<br>
large-scale battery falls.<br>
Furthermore, in the structure of a conventional dry battery, a<br>
thinly-compacted planar active material sheet, sandwiched in between separators, is<br>
rolled up into a cylindrical form. The rolled-up sheet is filled into a battery cell. For<br>
example, in a nickel-hydrogen secondary battery, a planar active material (a sheet<br>
into which hydrogen-occuluding alloy as an anode has been filled, for the case of<br>
nickel-hydrogen battery) which is in direct contact with a battery cell and which is<br>
the outermost surface, has a large contact area with a current collector (the battery<br>
cell is shared with an anode current collector), and a sheet, into which a cathode<br>
active material (nickel hydroxide) has been filled, is connected by welding to a fine<br>
conducting wire (a nickel plate or the like). Further, it is connected by welding to an<br>
external terminal. The problem arising here is that there are two welds and the<br>
cross sectional area of the conducting wire (nickel plate or the like) establishing<br>
connection between the active material and the external terminal is narrow.<br>
That is, the existence of welds increases electrical resistance, production<br>
cost and manufacturing time. Additionally, since the cross sectional area of the<br>
conducting wire (nickel plate or the like) establishing connection between the active<br>
material and the external terminal is narrow, it is inevitable that both electrical<br><br>
resistance and heat release value increase when a heavy current flows.<br>
Additionally, in the structure of a conventional industrial battery, for<br>
example, in the case of NiCd secondary battery, thinly-compacted, planar active<br>
material sheets are layered one upon the other so that the cathode, the separator,<br>
the anode, the separator, the cathode	in such order, and a fine<br>
conducting wire (nickel plate or the like) is connected to each planar active material<br>
sheet, and a group of the cathodes are connected by welding to an external<br>
terminal while a group of the anodes are connected by welding to an external<br>
terminal. The problem arising here is that electrical resistance, production cost,<br>
and manufacturing time increase because the plural planar active material sheets<br>
are connected by welding to the external terminal.<br>
The performance of single dry battery is satisfactory. However, if plural<br>
dry batteries are connected together in series or parallel when a large capacity<br>
battery is required, the output voltage drops due to the resistance of contact with<br>
external terminals. As a result, the battery becomes poor in performance. On the<br>
other hand, for the case of industrial batteries being originally large in size, they<br>
have problems with their basic structure, in other words there are many welding<br>
points. Accordingly, high-performance batteries are not obtained.<br>
In view of the above-described drawbacks, the present invention has been<br>
devised. Accordingly, the second problem to be solved by the present invention is<br>
to provide a high power type three-dimensional battery capable of increasing its size<br>
easily and generating high output power without undergoing a drop in performance<br>
due to the increase in size, and reducing production cost and manufacturing time.<br>

three-dimensional battery comprising a battery constitution unit having two vessels<br>
connected with a separator interposed therebetween that permits passage of ions<br>
but does not permit passage of electron, a forming product in powder, particle or<br>
plate shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in one of the vessels to<br>
discharge the electron, and a forming product in powder, particle or plate shape of<br><br>

electron,<br>
the three-dimensional battery having either a configuration which consists<br>

an active material cured by adding an electrically conductive filler and a resin to a<br>
material capable of causing a cell reaction, is so produced as to be formed<br>
integrally with at least any one of the separator, the dividing wall, and the current<br>
collector.<br>
The present invention provides a three-dimensional battery with an<br>
electrode structure comprising a battery constitution unit having two vessels<br>
connected with a separator interposed therebetween, a forming product in powder,<br>
particle or plate shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in one of the<br>
vessels to discharge the electron, and a forming product in powder, particle or plate<br>
shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in the other vessel to absorb<br>
the electron,<br>
the three-dimensional battery having either a configuration which consists<br>
of a single battery unit in which a current collector in contact with the active material<br>
is provided in each of the two vessels, or<br>
a configuration which consists of plural battery units layered one upon the<br>
other through respective dividing walls, in which vessels situated on both ends are<br>
each provided with a current collector in contact with the active material,<br>
wherein the active material cured by adding an electrically conductive filler<br>
and a resin to a material capable of causing a ceil reaction, is so produced as to be<br>
formed integrally with the separator.<br><br>
In the above-described constitution, the separator can be made of a<br>
material which undergoes no deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic<br>
solution, which has electrical insulation properties, and which permits passage of<br>
ions. For example, as the separator material, a textile or nonwoven cloth made of<br>
any one selected from the group consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene,<br>
nylon, polypropylene and the like, or membrane filter may be used.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a three-dimensional battery<br>
with an electrode structure comprising a battery unit having two vessels<br>
connected with a separator interposed therebetween, a forming product in powder,<br>
particle or plate shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in one of the<br>
vessels to discharge the electron, and a forming product in powder, particle or plate<br>
shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in the other vessel to absorb<br>

which vessels situated on both ends are each provided with a current collector in<br>
contact with the active material,<br>
wherein the active material cured by adding an electrically conductive filler<br>
and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction, is so produced as to be<br>
formed integrally with the dividing wall.<br>
In the above-described constitution, the dividing wall can be made of a<br>
material which undergoes no deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic<br>
solution, which does not permit passage of ions, and which has electrical conductive<br>
properties. For example, as the material of the dividing wall, any one selected from<br>
the group consisting of a nickel metal plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated<br>
iron, nickel-plated stainless steel, nickel-plated carbon and the like may be used.<br>
Additionally, either the dividing wall is planar, or the dividing wall has projected<br>
portions in needle, plate, wave, particle, or the like shape. Furthermore, the<br>
dividing wall provided with a cooling structure which has refrigerant flowing path<br>
inside may be used.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a three-dimensional battery<br>
with an electrode structure comprising a battery unit having two vessels<br><br>
connected with a separator interposed therebetween, a forming product in powder,<br>
particle or plate shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in one of the<br>
vessels to discharge the electron, and a forming product in powder, particle or plate<br>
shape of active material in an electrolytic solution filled in the other vessel to absorb<br>
the electron,<br>
the three-dimensional battery having either a configuration which consists<br>
of a single battery unit in which a current collector in contact with the active material<br>
is provided in each of the two vessels, or<br>
a configuration which consists of plural battery units layered one upon the<br>
other through respective dividing walls, in which vessels situated on both ends are<br>
each provided with a current collector in contact with the active material,<br>
wherein the active material cured by adding an electrically conductive filler<br>
and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction, is so produced as to be<br>
formed integrally with the current collector.<br>
In the above-described arrangement, the current collector can be made of<br>
a material which undergoes no deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali<br>
electrolytic solution, which does not permit passage of ions, and which has electrical<br>
conductive properties. For example, as the material of the current collector, any<br>
one selected from the group consisting of a nickel metal plate, a nickel metal foil,<br>
carbon, nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated stainless steel, nickel-plated carbon and the<br>
like may be used. Furthermore, it is preferable that the current collector in contact<br>
with the active material is provided with an additional ion permeable current<br>
collector which has voids therein, which permits passage of ions, and which has<br>
electrical conductive properties. In addition, the ion permeable current collector can<br>
be made of at least any one selected from the group consisting of a nickel metal<br>
mesh, carbon fibers, a mesh-like body made of nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated<br>
stainless steel and the like, foamed nickel metal, nickel-plated foamed resin,<br>
nickel-plated carbon fibers, nickel-plated inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and<br>
the like, nickel-plated organic fibers, nickel-plated felt, and nickel-plated foil made of<br>
an inorganic substance such as mica. Furthermore, either the current collector is<br>
planar or the current collector has projected portions in needle, plate, wave, particle,<br>
or the like shape. Additionally, the current collector provided with a cooling<br><br>
structure which has refrigerant flowing path inside may be employed.<br>
The present invention provides a three-dimensional battery with an<br>
electrode structure which is characterized in that an active material cured by<br>
adding an electrically conductive filler and a resin to a material capable of causing a<br>
cell reaction, is so produced as to be formed integrally with at least any two of a<br>
separator, a dividing wall, and a current collector. In this way, when producing an<br>
electrode for use in a three-dimensional battery, an active material and at least any<br>
two of a separator, a dividing wall, and a current collector are combined together<br>
and formed integrally with one another in one piece.<br>
In the above-described electrode structure, active material of all kinds may<br>
be used as an active material, regardless of the type of battery and regardless of<br>
cathode or anode. For example, as the active material, nickel hydroxide and<br>
hydrogen-occluding alloy which serve as a cathode active material and as an anode<br>
active material respectively in a nickel-hydrogen secondary battery may be used.<br>
In addition to these materials, battery active material known in the art, such as<br>
cadmium hydroxide, lead, lead dioxide, lithium and the like, may be used.<br>
Additionally, general solid substances, such as wood, black lead, carbon, iron ore,<br>
iron carbide, iron sulfide, ion hydroxide, iron oxide, coal, charcoal, sand, gravel,<br>
silica, slag, chaff and the like may be used.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-described electrode structure, an electrically<br>
conductive filler which is added to the active material can be made of either any one<br>
selected from the group consisting of carbon fibers, nickel-plated carbon fibers,<br>
nickel-plated inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and the like, nickel-plated<br>
organic fibers, nickel-plated foil made of an inorganic substance such as mica,<br>
carbon particles, nickel-plated carbon particles, nickel in fiber shape, nickel particles,<br>
and nickel foil or any combination thereof.<br>
Additionally, a resin which is added to the active material may be selected<br>
from the group consisting of a thermoplastic resin having the softening temperature<br>
of which is up to 120 °C, a resin having the curing temperature of which ranges<br>
from room temperature up to 120 °C, a resin dissolvable in a solvent having the<br>
evaporating temperature of which does not exceed 120 °C, a resin dissolvable in a<br>
water-soluble solvent, and a resin dissolvable in an alcohol-soluble solvent. For<br><br>
example, in the case where a nickel hydroxide as active material is used, its activity<br>
is lost at temperatures above 130 °C, therefore requiring that various processes be<br>
carried out at temperatures below 130 °C. In addition, since active materials are<br>
used in an alkali electrolyte solution, alkali resistance is needed for the active<br>
materials.<br>
As the thermoplastic resin having a softening temperature of up to 120 °C,<br>
any one selected from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, and<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer may be used. As the resin having a curing<br>
temperature ranging from room temperature up to 120 °C, reaction-curing resin<br>
(e.g., epoxy resin, urethane resin, unsaturated polyester resin and the like),<br>
thermosetting resin (e.g., phenol resin and the like), or the like may be used. As<br>
the resin dissolvable in a solvent having an evaporating temperature that does not<br>
exceed 120 °C, any one of the foregoing thermoplastic resins may be used. The<br>
solvent-soluble resin is dissolved in a solvent, and added to an active material<br>
substance, and the solvent is removed by evaporation, extraction, or the like.<br>
Additionally, as the resin dissolvable in a water-soluble and extractable solvent, any<br>
one selected from the group consisting of polyether sulfone resin (PES),<br>
polystyrene, polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyamide,<br>
polyimide and the like may be used. As the resin dissolvable in an alcohol-soluble<br>
and extractable solvent, any one of acetylcellulose, oxide phenylene ether (PPO), or<br>
the like may be used.<br>
In the above-described electrode structure, the active material may be in<br>
any one of powder, particle, plate, scale, cylindrical rod, polygonal cylindrical rod,<br>
sphere, dice, cube, amorphous particle shape and the like shape. Additionally, the<br>
surface of the active material is coated either with a nickel-plated layer or with at<br>
least any one selected from the group consisting of carbon fibers, nickel-plated<br>
carbon fibers, nickel-plated organic fibers, nickel-plated inorganic fibers made of<br>
silica, alumina and the like, nickel-plated foil made of inorganic substance such as<br>
mica, carbon powder, nickel-plated carbon powder, nickel in fiber form, and nickel<br>
particle and nickel foil.<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing a three-dimensional<br>
battery with an electrode structure which is characterized in that, when<br><br>
producing an electrode for use in a three-dimensional battery having the<br>
above-described constitution, an active material cured by adding an electrically<br>
conductive filler and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction, and a<br>
separator are combined together and formed integrally with each other in one piece.<br>
In such a method, the separator can be made of a material which undergoes no<br>
deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic solution, which has electrical<br>
insulation properties, and which permits passage of ions and wherein the separator<br>
material is a textile or nonwoven cloth made of any one selected from the group<br>
consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon and the<br>
like, or membrane filter.<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing a three-dimensional<br>

above-described constitution, an active material cured by adding an electrically<br>
conductive filler and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction, and a<br>

piece. In such a method, the dividing wall can be made of a material which<br>
undergoes no deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic solution, which<br>
does not permit passage of ions, and which has electrical conductive properties.<br>
The dividing wall material is selected from the group consisting of a nickel metal<br>
plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated stainless steel,<br>
nickel-plated carbon and the like. Additionally, preferably the dividing wall is<br>
provided with projected portions in needle, plate, wave, particle or the like shape in<br>
order to obtain a greater current collecting area.<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing a three-dimensional<br>
battery with an electrode structure which is characterized in that, when<br>
producing an electrode for use in a three-dimensional battery having the<br>
above-described constitution, an active material cured by adding an electrically<br>
conductive filler and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction, and a<br>
current collector are combined together and formed integrally with each other in one<br>
piece. In such a method, the current collector can be made of a material which<br>
undergoes no deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic solution, which<br><br>
does not permit passage of ions, and which has electrical conductive properties.<br>
The current collector material is selected from the group consisting of a nickel metal<br>
plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated stainless steel,<br>
nickel-plated carbon and the like. Preferably the current collector in contact with<br>
the active material is provided with an additional ion permeable current collector<br>
which has voids therein, which permits passage of ions, and which has electrical<br>
conductive properties, in order to obtain a greater current collecting area. The ion<br>
permeable current collector can be made of any one of a nickel metal mesh, carbon<br>
fibers, a mesh-like body made of nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated stainless steel and<br>
the like, foamed nickel metal, nickel-plated foamed resin, nickel-plated carbon fibers,<br>

organic fibers, nickel-plated felt, and nickel-plated foil made of an inorganic<br>
substance such as mica. Additionally, preferably the current collector is provided<br>
with projected portions in needle, plate, wave, particle or the like shape in order to<br>
obtain a greater current collecting area.<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing a three-dimensional<br>
battery with an electrode structure which is characterized in that, when<br>
producing an electrode for use in a three-dimensional battery having the<br>
above-described constitution, an active material cured by adding an electrically<br>
conductive filler and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction, and at<br>
least any two of a separator, a dividing wall, and a current collector are combined<br>
together and formed integrally with one another in one piece.<br>
At the time when combining an active material with a separator, a dividing<br>
wall, and a current collector to form them into one piece, pressurized forming and/or<br>
forming by a resin mixed with an electrically conductive filler may be carried out.<br>
2. INVENTIONS FOR SOLVING THE SECOND PROBLEM<br>
In order to solve the second problem, the present invention provides a<br>
high power type three-dimensional battery wherein:<br>
a bellows-shaped separator is so located between a cathode current<br>
collector and an anode current collector which are disposed face to face with each<br>
other as to come close to the current collectors alternately,<br>
either powder or a forming product of a cathode active material is filled,<br><br>
together with an electrolytic solution, in a space defined by the bellows-shaped<br>
separator and the cathode current collector,<br>
either powder or a forming product of an anode active material is filled,<br>
together with an electrolytic solution, in a space defined by the bellows-shaped<br>
separator and the anode current collector, and<br>
the cathode active materials and the anode active materials are filled<br>
alternately, facing each other across the separator.<br>
In the above-described constitution, a plurality of units, each comprising at<br>
least one cathode active material and at least one anode active material which are<br>
filled alternately facing each other across a bellows-shaped separator, are mounted<br>
in parallel in a vessel defined between the cathode current collector and the anode<br>
current collector, for providing high output powers.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to provide high voltages by layering in series<br>
batteries, in each of which cathode active materials and anode active materials are<br>
so mounted into being bellows-shaped as to face each other across a separator,<br>
one upon the other through respective dividing walls.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to provide high voltages by layering in series<br>
batteries, in each of which a plurality of units described above are mounted in<br>
parallel, one upon the other through respective dividing walls.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-described constitution, a shape of the cathode<br>
active materials and anode active materials to be filled is any one of powders, a<br>
forming product in particle, plate, block or rod form, secondary formed particles in<br>
block or plate form, or pasty powders or particles. When used in pasty form,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or the like may be used as a solvent for the dispersion of<br>
powders and the like.<br>
Additionally, in the above-described constitution, preferably an ion<br>
permeable current collector is mounted in given parts (a surface portion and an<br>
inner portion) of each of the active materials which are so mounted as to face each<br>
other across the bellows-shaped separator.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-described constitution, preferably a given<br>
surface of each of the active materials which are so mounted as to face each other<br>
across the bellows-shaped separator is coated with an ion permeable current<br><br>
collector. In this case, one prepared by coating an active material surface with an<br>
ion permeable current collector so that they are formed integrally in one piece may<br>
be used.<br>
The ion permeable current collector can be made of a material which has<br>
voids therein, which permits passage of ions, and which has electrical conductive<br>
properties. For example, the ion permeable current collector material is selected<br>
from the group consisting of foamed nickel metal, a nickel metal mesh, nickel-plated<br>
punching metal, metal such as expanded metal and the like, nickel-plated foamed<br>
resin such as urethane and the like, nickel-plated porous material made of<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, cotton, carbon fibers and the like, nickel-plated<br>
inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and the like, nickel-plated organic fibers,<br>
nickel-plated felt, and nickel-plated foil made of an inorganic substance such as<br>
mica.<br>
The separator can be made of a material which undergoes no<br>
deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic solution, which has electrical<br>
insulation properties, and which permits passage of ions. For example, as the<br>
separator material, a textile or nonwoven cloth made of any one selected from the<br>
group consisting of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon and<br>
the like or membrane filter may be used.<br>
The cathode current collectors and anode current collectors are each<br>
made of a material which undergoes no deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali<br>
electrolytic solution, which does not permit passage of ions, and which has<br>
electrical conductive properties. For example, as each material of the cathode<br>
current collectors and anode current collectors, any one selected from the group<br>
consisting of a nickel metal plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron,<br>
nickel-plated stainless steel, nickel-plated carbon and the like may be used.<br>
The dividing wall can be made of a material which undergoes no<br>
deterioration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolytic solution, which does not<br>
permit passage of ions, and which has electrical conductive properties. For<br>
example, as the dividing wall material, any one selected from the group consisting<br>
of a nickel metal plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated<br>
stainless steel, nickel-plated carbon and the like may be used.<br><br>
As the active material, one cured by addition of an electrically conductive<br>
filler and a resin to a material capable of causing a cell reaction may be used.<br>
As the active material, active material of all kinds may be used, regardless<br>
of the type of battery and regardless of cathode or anode. For example, nickel<br>
hydroxide and hydrogen-occluding alloy which serve as a cathode active material<br>
and as an anode active material respectively in a nickel-hydrogen secondary battery<br>
may be used.<br>
As the electrically conductive filler, either any one selected from the group<br>
consisting of carbon fibers, nickel-plated carbon fibers, carbon particles,<br>
nickel-plated carbon particles, nickel-plated organic fibers, nickel-plated inorganic<br>
fibers made of silica, alumina and the like, nickel-plated foil made of an inorganic<br>
substance such as mica, nickel in fiber form, nickel particles, and nickel foil or any<br>
combination thereof may be used.<br>
Additionally, the resin which is added to the active material may be<br>
selected from the group consisting of a thermoplastic resin having the softening<br>
temperature of which is up to 120 °C, a resin having the curing temperature of<br>
which ranges from room temperature up to 120 °C, a resin dissolvable in a solvent<br>
having the evaporating temperature of which does not exceed 120 °C, a resin<br>
dissolvable in a water-soluble solvent, and a resin dissolvable in an alcohol-soluble<br>
solvent. For example, in the case where a nickel hydroxide as active material is<br>
used, its activity is lost at temperatures above 130 °C, therefore requiring that<br>
various processes be carried out at temperatures below 130 °C. In addition, since<br>
active materials are used in an alkali electrolyte solution, alkali resistance is needed<br>
for the active materials.<br>
As the thermoplastic resin having a softening temperature of up to 120 °C,<br>
any one selected from the group consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, and<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) may be used. As the resin having a curing<br>
temperature ranging from room temperature up to 120 °C, reaction-curing resin<br>
(e.g., epoxy resin, urethane resin, unsaturated polyester resin and the like),<br>
thermosetting resin (e.g., phenol resin and the like), or the like may be used. As<br>
the resin dissolvable in a solvent having an evaporating temperature that does not<br>
exceed 120 °C, any one of the foregoing thermoplastic resins may be used. The<br><br>
solvent-soluble resin is dissolved in a solvent, and added to an active material<br>
substance, and the solvent is removed by evaporation, extraction, or other<br>
technique. Additionally, as the resin dissolvable in a water-soluble and extractable<br>
solvent, any one selected from the group consisting of polyether sulfone resin<br>
(PES), polystyrene, polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyamide,<br>
polyimide and the like may be used. As the resin dissolvable in an alcohol-soluble<br>
and extractable solvent, acetylcellulose, oxide phenylene ether (PPO), or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
By virtue of the above-described construction, the present invention<br>
provides the following advantages.<br>
1)	The inventions for solving the first problem provide the following excellent<br>
effects.<br>
(1)	When producing an electrode of a three-dimensional battery, it<br>
becomes possible to reduce the number of component parts required at the time of<br>
battery assembly, the time required for assembly, and the cost of assembly because<br>
of formation by combination of an active material with at least one of a separator, a<br>
dividing wall, and a current collector.<br>
(2)	By providing a dividing wall and a current collector with projected<br>
portions in needle, plate, wave, particle, or the like form, the current collecting area<br>
is increased. This makes charging and discharging at high rate (high current<br>
charging and discharging) possible, thereby achieving improvements in battery<br>
performance.<br>
(3)	By the use of an ion permeable current collector having therein voids,<br>
the current collecting area is increased. This makes charging and discharging at<br>
high rate (high current charging and discharging) possible, thereby achieving<br>
improvements in battery performance,<br>
(4)	Because of the arrangement that a dividing wall and a current<br>
collector are provided with a cooling structure, it becomes possible to suppress the<br>
increase in temperature caused by a cell reaction, thereby achieving improvements<br>
in battery performance.<br>
2)	The inventions for solving the second problem provide the following excellent<br>
effects.<br><br>
(1)	Because of the arrangement that cathode active materials and anode<br>
active materials are disposed into being bellows-shaped and facing each other<br>
across a separator, the distance between these active materials is reduced, and the<br>
distance for which electrons move is reduced, thereby achieving high output<br>
powers. In addition, the length for which ions diffuse is reduced, thereby achieving<br>
excellent diffusion of ions. Besides, when gas is generated from the active material<br>
because of overcharge or the like, the gas flows to the opposite electrode and is<br>
likely to be consumed easily, and sealing can be established easily.<br>
(2)	Because of the use of cathode and anode active materials each of<br>
which is coated with an ion permeable current collector made of porous nickel or<br>
the like, the distance between the active materials and the current collector is<br>
reduced, and not only the distance for which electrons move is reduced, but also<br>
the current collecting area is increased, thereby providing a high performance<br>
battery whose electrical resistance is small.<br>
(3)	By the arrangement that a battery ceil is loaded with a plurality of<br>
bellows-shaped units, the increase in size (magnification of scale) can be achieved<br>
easily and, in addition, since there are no welds causing electrical resistance to<br>
increase, the drop in performance due to the increase in size will not take place.<br>
Additionally, the production cost and the production time can be reduced.<br>
(4)	Since the separator and the ion permeable current collector exist<br>
relatively plentifully in the inside of the battery cell, the filling amount of each of<br>
cathode and anode active materials per unit volume is small, thereby making it<br>
possible to hold a plenty of electrolytic solution within the cell. Accordingly, the dry<br>
out phenomenon, in which a solid-liquid reaction (a cell reaction) will no longer<br>
occur due to electrolytic solution depletion, is unlikely to occur.<br><br>
(5)	If the thickness of active material is reduced because high power<br>
battery performance is required, this relatively increases the ratio of separator and<br>
ion permeable current collector. As a result, despite the drop in volume energy<br>
density it becomes possible to obtain a high power battery.<br>
(6)	On the other hand, if the thickness of active material is increased<br>
because high power battery performance is not required, this relatively reduces the<br>
ratio of separator and ion permeable current collector. As a result, it becomes<br><br>
possible to obtain a battery having a high volume energy density.<br>
(7) Finally, any changes to the battery specification can be made just by<br>
increasing or decreasing the thickness of active material, and desired battery<br>
specifications can be obtained easily.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described. It is<br>
to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the following<br>
embodiments at all. Adequate modifications of the present invention are possible to<br>
make.<br>
In the first place, the details of the cell reaction of a three-dimensional<br>
battery will be explained with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a battery having a cathode active material in<br>
the form of particles and an anode active material in the form of particles. As<br><br>
shown in Figure 1, an anode vessel 2 and a cathode vessel 3 are so defined as to<br>
face each other across an ion permeable filter (separator) 1. An anode active<br>
material 4 in particle form is filled into the anode vessel 2, together with an<br>
electrolyte solution. On the other hand, a cathode active material 5 in particle<br>
form is filled into the cathode vessel 3, together with an electrolyte solution. These<br>
active materials are present as fixed layers in the respective electrolyte solutions.<br>
In Figure 1, each active material particle is shown such that it has the same size as<br>
the other. In fact, these active material particles naturally differ in size from one<br>
another.<br>
The separator 1 is a filter which has electrical insulation properties and<br>
which permits passage of ions therethrough, and is a membrane which does not<br>
permit passage of powdered and particulate material. As the material of the<br>
separator 1, for example, unglazed pottery, ion exchange resin membrane or high<br>
polymer fabric may be used.<br>
Furthermore, an anode current collector 6 which is an electrical conductor<br>
is disposed in the inside of the anode vessel 2, while a cathode current collector 7<br>
which is an electrical conductor is disposed in the inside of the cathode vessel 3.<br>
The current collectors 6 and 7 are connected to a load means 8 (in the case of<br>
discharging) or to a power generating means 8 (in the case of charging).<br>
Reference numeral 9 denotes an electrolyte solution interface.<br>
Next, with respect to the battery of the present embodiment, charging and<br>
discharging mechanisms will be described below.<br>
CHARGING<br>
Electrons are supplied from the anode current collector 6 by application of<br>
voltage to the battery. An electron released from the anode current collector 6<br>
moves directly or through a powdered and particulate active material to the<br>
powdered and particulate active material of the anode and reacts. An ion<br>
generated by the reaction passes through the separator 1 and moves into the<br>
cathode vessel 3. In the cathode vessel 3, the ion reacts with the powdered and<br>
particulate active material of the cathode and discharges an electron. The electron<br>
moves directly or through the powdered and particulate material to the cathode<br>
current collector 7, and is delivered to the power generating means 8.<br><br>
DISCHARGING<br>
Electrons are supplied from the anode current collector 6 by application of<br>
load to the battery. An active material positive-ionized in the inside of the anode<br>
vessel 2 discharges electrons. An electron moves directly or through a powdered<br>
and particulate material to the anode current collector 6. An ion generated by the<br>
reaction passes through the separator 1 and moves into the cathode vessel 3. In<br>
the cathoe vessel 3, the ion reacts with the powdered and particulate active material<br>
of the cathode and with an electron. An electron moves directly or through the<br>
powdered and particulate material to the cathode current collector 7, and is supplied<br>
to the load means 8.<br>
1) EMBODIMENTS FOR SOLVING THE FIRST PROBLEM<br>
Referring next to Figure 2, is shown diagrammatically an example of a<br>
vessel structure of a three-dimensional battery of the layered type. Figure 2 shows<br>
a three-layered type three-dimensional battery. Cathode and anode vessels are<br>
formed through a separator 10 which undergoes no degeneration such as corrosion<br>
in an alkali electrolyte solution and which is capable of providing electrical insulation<br>
and of permitting passage of ions therethrough. A cathode active material 12 is<br>
loaded into the cathode vessel cell, together with an electrolyte (KOH, NaOH, LiOH<br>
and the like) solution, while an anode active material 14 is loaded into the anode<br>
vessel, together with an electrolyte (KOH, NaOH, LiOH and thelike) solution. Each<br>
unit battery consisting of a cathode vessel and an anode vessel, is layered one<br>
upon the other in series through a respective dividing wall 16 made of a material<br>
which undergoes no degeneration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolyte solution,<br>
which does not permit passage of ions, and which has electrical conductive<br>
properties, and a cathode current collector 18 in contact with the cathode active<br>
material 12 is disposed in a vessel at one end while an anode current collector 20<br>
in contact with the anode active material 14 is disposed in a vessel at the other end.<br>
The cathode current collector 18 and the anode current collector 20 are each<br>
made of a material which undergoes no degeneration such as corrosion in an alkali<br>
electrolyte solution, which does not permit passage of ions, and which has electrical<br>
conductive properties, and electricity is taken outside through these current<br>
collectors.<br><br>
As the material of the separator 10, a textile or nonwoven cloth made of<br>
any one of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon and the like<br>
or membrane filter may be used. As the material of each of the dividing wall 16,<br>
the cathode current collector 18, and the anode current collector 20, a nickel metal<br>
plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated stainless steel,<br>
nickel-plated carbon and the like may be used. Additionally, the dividing wall 16,<br>
the cathode current collector 18, and the anode current collector 20 may be shaped<br>
like a flat plate. More preferably, these components are provided with projected<br>
portions in needle, plate, wave, particle, or the like form for the purpose of providing<br>
an increased current collecting area. For example, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, it<br>
is possible to provide a current collector (or a dividing wall) 24 with projected<br>
portions 26. Additionally, by the arrangement that refrigerant is made to flow in the<br>
inside of each of the dividing wall 16, the cathode current collector 18, and the<br>
anode current collector 20, it becomes possible to provide them with a cooling<br>
structure. For example, Figure 5 shows an example cooling structure in which a<br>
bellows-shaped heat transfer tube 30, through which refrigerant flows, is disposed in<br>
the inside of a plate-like current collector (or a dividing wall) 28. Reference numeral<br>
32 indicates a refrigerant inlet port. Reference numeral 34 indicates a refrigerant<br>
outlet port.<br>
In addition to the above, preferably an ion permeable current collector,<br>
which has voids therein, which permits passage of ions therethrough, and which is<br>
electrically conductive, is added as a current collector for bypass, for providing an<br>
increased current collecting area by increasing the area of contact with the active<br>
material. As the material of such a current collector, a nickel metal mesh, a<br>
mesh-like body made of nickel-plated iron or nickel-plated stainless steel (for<br>
example, punching metal, expanded metal and the like), foamed nickel metal,<br>
nickel-plated foamed resin, nickel-plated carbon fibers, nickel-plated organic fibers,<br>
nickel-plated felt, nickel-plated inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and the like,<br>
or nickel-plated foil made of inorganic substancesuch as mica may be used.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, is shown an arrangement by way of example in which an ion<br>
permeable current collector 22 is interposed between the separator 10 and the<br>
cathode active material 12 and the ion permeable current collector 22 is connected<br><br>
to the cathode current collector 18 to form a single current collector. Such an ion<br>
permeable current collector may be disposed on the separator side so that larger<br>
areas are brought into contact with the active material thereby increasing the current<br>
collecting area.<br>
In the above-described three-dimensional battery, active material<br>
substances of all kinds may be used as an active material which causes a cell<br>
reaction, regardless of the type of battery and regardless of cathode or anode. For<br>
example, for the case of nickel-hydrogen batteries, the cathode active material 12<br>
comprises nickel hydroxide and the anode active material 14 comprises a<br>
hydrogen-occluding alloy. Additionally, for the case of NiCd batteries, the cathode<br>
active material 12 comprises nickel hydroxide and the anode active material 14<br>
comprises cadmium.<br>
The active material may be in the form of powders. Alternatively, the<br>
active material may made of a particulate or plate-shaped material with an<br>
electrically conductive filler and a resin. The active material is combined with at<br>
least two of a separator, a dividing wall, and a current collector (including ion<br>
permeable current collector). And such a mixture is subjected to being formed<br>
integrally with one another in one piece, and the resultant formation is used as an<br>
electrode material. The way of producing such an electrode material will be<br>
described later.<br>
The electrically conductive filler comprises carbon fibers, nickel-plated<br>
carbon fibers, carbon particles, nickel-plated carbon particles, nickel-plated organic<br>
fibers, nickel-plated inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and the like,<br>
nickel-plated foil made of inorganic substance such as mica, nickel in fiber form,<br>
nickel particles, nickel foil and the like.<br>
As the resin that is added when shaping an active material into particle or<br>
plate form, thermoplastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymer and the like may be used. In this case, it may be arranged such<br>
that a thermoplastic resin is melted by application of heat and is mixed with an<br>
active material to uniformly disperse the active material. Alternatively, it may be<br>
arranged such that a resin dissolved by a solvent is added. For example,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer are all soluble in<br><br>
solvents such as heated benzene, heated toluene, heated xylene and the like.<br>
A resin dissolved in such a solvent is mixed with an active material, and<br>
with an electrically conductive filler if necessary. Thereafter, the solvent is removed<br>
by evaporation, thereby making it possible to produce an active material forming<br>
product cured by the resin.<br>
Additionally, as a reaction-curing resin, epoxy resin, urethane resin,<br>
unsaturated polyester resin or the like may be used, and a thermosetting resin, e.g.,<br>
phenol resin, may be used as a binder.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where a resin dissolved in a water-soluble solvent<br>
is added when shaping an active material into particle, plate, or the like form, an<br>
active material forming product cured by the resin is prepared by extraction and<br>
removal of the solvent by the use of water. For example, polyether sulfone (PES)<br>
resin is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Additionally, polystyrene is soluble in<br>
acetone. Polysulfone is soluble in dimethylformamide (DMF) and DMSO.<br>
Polyacrylonitrile is soluble in DMF, DMSO, and ethylene carbonate. Polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride is soluble in DMF, DMSO, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Polyamide<br>
is soluble in DMF and NMP. Polyimide is soluble in DMF and NMP.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where a resin dissolved in an alcohol-soluble<br>
solvent is added when shaping an active material into particle, plate, or the like<br>
form, an active material forming product cured by the resin is prepared by extraction<br>
and removal of the solvent by the use of alcohol. For example, acetyl cellulose is<br>
soluble in methylene chloride. Oxide phenylene ether (PPO) is soluble in<br>
methylene chloride.<br>
Additionally, the surface of an active material shaped into particle, plate, or<br>
the like form may be coated with electrical conductive materials such as carbon<br>
fibers, nickel-plated carbon fibers, nickel-plated organic fibers, nickel-plated<br>
inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and the like, nickel-plated foil made of<br>
inorganic substance such as mica, carbon powder, nickel-plated carbon powder,<br>
nickel in fiber form, nickel powders, nickel foil and the like. Such coating is carried<br>
out as follows. Before the active material formed substance is cured, a coating<br>
material such as any one of the above-described metal powders, metal fibers,<br>
metal-plated fibers and the like is added. By rolling, stirring or the like, the coating<br><br>
material is adhered to the outer surface of the forming product in a soft state. For<br>
the case of a forming product cured by resin, for the case of a forming product<br>
employing a thermosoftening resin, or for the case of a forming product employing a<br>
solvent-soluble resin, each of the forming products is placed in the uncured state by<br>
increasing the temperature of the forming product for softening by application of<br>
heat or by swelling and softening by addition of a solvent, and an impregnated<br>
metal is added to the forming product for impregnation. Additionally, a surface of<br>
the active material in particle, plate, or the like form may be plated with nickel.<br>
A method of producing an electrode material of the three-dimensional<br>
battery in accordance with the present invention will be described. When producing<br>
an electrode of a three-dimensional battery, an active material of the<br>
above-described composition is combined with any one or at least two of a<br>
separator, a dividing wall, and a current collector (including an ion permeable<br>
current collector) so that they are formed integrally with one another in one piece.<br>
Such formation is carried out as follows. A mixture of a powdered active<br>
material with an electrically conducive filler and a resin is stirred. The mixture is<br>
integrally combined with a separator, a dividing wall and/or a current collector.<br>
Then, pressurized forming is carried out while applying heat. In this case, the<br>
formation can be achieved by the use of a resin mixed with an electrically<br>
conductive filler without application of pressure. As the resin, thermoplastic resins<br>
such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and the like<br>
may be used.<br>
Additionally, a thermoplastic resin dissolved in a solvent such as heated<br>
toluene, heated xylene and the like is mixed with a powdered active material and an<br>
electrically conductive filler to uniformly disperse the active material and the filler.<br>
Then, the mixture is stirred and granulated to form granulated particles. These<br>
granulated particles are integrally combined with a separator, a dividing wall and/or<br>
a current collector. Then, pressurizede forming is carried out while applying heat.<br>
At this time, it is possible to cure the resin by evaporating the solvent contained in<br>
the forming product. Also in this case, the formation can be achieved by the use of<br>
a resin mixed with an electrically conductive filler without application of pressure.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where an active material shaped into particle,<br><br>
plate, or the like form is integrally formed in one piece with a separator, a dividing<br>
wall and/or a current collector, such formation can be carried out by re-dissolving<br>
the resin contained in the forming product without addition of a new resin.<br>
Additionally, it is possible to provide integral formation in one piece by the<br>
use of a reaction-curing resin (such as epoxy resin, urethane resin, unsaturated<br>
polyester resin and the like) or a thermosetting resin such as phenol resin.<br>
The aforesaid integral formation in one piece may be achieved by using, as<br>
a resin dissolved in a water-soluble solvent, a PES resin dissolved in DMSO,<br>
polystyrene dissolved in acetone, polysulfone dissolved in DMF or DMSO,<br>
polyacrylonitrile dissolved in DMF, DMSO, or ethylene carbonate, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride dissolved in DMF, DMSO, or NMP, polyamide dissolved in DMF or NMP, or<br>
polyimide dissolved in DMF or NMP, in this case the solvent is extracted and<br>
removed from the forming product by the use of water. Additionally, the integral<br>
formation in one piece may be achieved by using, as a resin dissolved in an<br>
alcohol-soluble solvent, acetyl cellulose dissolved in methylene chloride, oxide<br>
phenylene ether (PPO) dissolved in methylene chloride or the like, in this case the<br>
solvent is extracted and removed from the forming product by the use of alcohol.<br>
In the structure of an electrode produced in accordance with the method of<br>
the present invention, an active material is combined with at least two of a<br>
separator, a dividing wall, and a current collector, thereby reducing the number of<br>
component parts required at the time of three-dimensional battery assembly, the<br>
time required for assembly, and the costs of assembly.<br>
Hereinafter, embodiment examples of the present invention will be<br>

mixing operation at 1000 rpm for about three minutes. Separately, 150 g of<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was added to 1000 g of xylene heated to a<br>
temperature of 60 °C for dissolution therein. The resin dissolved in the heated<br>
xylene was added to a mixture of the slag and electrically conductive filler, heated<br>
to a temperature of 60 °C. While maintaining temperature at 60 °C, by application<br>
of heat, the content of the Henschel mixer was stirred. Then, the Henschel mixer<br>
was cooled while still continuing stirring, and the mixed and kneaded substance was<br>
cooled and ground to powders. The powders were put in a high speed mixer and<br>
were entirely stirred by an agitator while at the same time controlling the size of<br>
granulated particles by means of a chopper. The internal volume of the high speed<br>
mixer used was 2 litters. The speed of rotation of the agitator used was 600 rpm.<br>
The speed of rotation of the chopper used was 1500 rpm. Under these conditions,<br>
the temperature of the powders was increased from room temperature to 50 °C with<br>
stirring. After generation of granulated particles, stirring was stopped while still<br>
continuing cooling. The particles contained therein xylene. Accordingly, the<br>
particles were placed in a reduced pressure dryer and were heated to 50 °C for<br>
removal of the xylene therefrom. After being cooled, the particles were sieved with<br>
a sieve having a mesh size of 2.88 mm and with a sieve having a mesh size of 1<br>
mm. As a result, granulated particles ranging in size between 1 mm and 2.88 mm<br>
were obtained.<br>
A current collector (a nickel plate) was previously spread over the bottom<br>
of a mold frame having a cross section of 100 mm x 100 mm. Then, the<br>
granulated particles were poured, from above, onto the current collector. While<br>
applying heat from above, a pressure of 0.1 MPa was applied for achieving<br>
pressurized forming, and in such a state the temperature was reduced to cause the<br>
resin to cure. A forming product thus formed was removed from the mold frame.<br>
In this way, an electrode material comprising an integral formation in one piece of<br>
the active material with the current collector was obtained.<br>

150 g of particulate graphite (acetylene black) was put into a Henschel<br>
mixer having an internal volume of 10 litters. The graphite particles were stirred at<br>
1000 rpm for about three minutes to obtain thorough dispersion thereof. Then, 500<br>
g of carbon (prepared by calcining carbon fibers at 1100 °C) was added to the<br>
content of the mixer. Then, the mixer was operated for performing mixing operation<br>
at 1000 rpm for about three minutes. Separately, 150 g of ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer was added to 1000 g of xylene heated to a temperature of 60 °C for<br>
dissolution therein. The resin dissolved in the heated xylene was added to a<br>
mixture of the carbon and electrically conductive filler, heated to a temperature of 60<br>
°C. While maintaining temperature at 60 °C by application of heat, the content of<br>
the Henschel mixer was stirred. Then, the Henschel mixer was cooled while still<br>
continuing stirring, and the mixed and kneaded substance was cooled and ground<br>
to powders. The powders were put in a high speed mixer and were entirely stirred<br>
by an agitator while at the same time controlling the size of granulated particles by<br>

litters. The speed of rotation of the agitator used was 600 rpm. The speed of<br>
rotation of the chopper used was 1500 rpm. Under these conditions, the<br>
temperature of the powders was increased from room temperature up to 50 °C with<br>
stirring. After generation of granulated particles, stirring was stopped while still<br>
continuing cooling. The particles contained therein xylene. Accordingly, the<br>
particles were placed in a reduced pressure dryer and were heated to 50 °C for<br>

A current collector (a nickel plate) was previously spread over the bottom<br>

2) EMBODIMENTS FOR SOLVING THE SECOND PROBLEM<br><br>
Referring to Figure 6, is shown an example of a first embodiment of a high<br>
power type three-dimensional battery in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The present embodiment is a battery that is constructed of a single basic unit alone.<br>
A resin and an electrically conductive filler are added to an active material<br>
substance which causes a cell reaction, and the mixture is formed and cured to<br>
prepare an active material forming product in particle, plate, block, rod, or the like<br>
form. In this case, an active material substance in the form of powders may be<br>
used as it is. Alternatively, a secondarily formed active material in the form of<br>
particles may be used. Additionally, a powdered or particulate active material like<br>
paste by the use of PVA or the like may be used. Active material substances of all<br>
kinds may be used to form an active material capable of causing a cell reaction,<br>
regardless of the type of battery and regardless of cathode or anode. For the case<br>
of nickel-hydrogen secondary batteries, for example, 2000 g of nickel hydroxide<br>
powders, 200 g of EVA resin, and 300 g of electrically conductive filler (carbon<br>
black and carbon fibers) are mixed together and, thereafter, the mixture is subjected<br>
to pressurized forming by application of a pressure of 0.1 MPa to form a plate-like<br>
cathode active material 40 (100 mm x 30 mm x 3 mm (thickness)). Likewise, for<br>
the case of nickel-hydrogen secondary batteries, for example, 6000 g of<br>
hydrogen-occluding alloy powders, 200 g of EVA resin, and 300 g of electrically<br>
conductive filler (carbon black and carbon fibers) are mixed together and, thereafter,<br>
the mixture is subjected to pressurized forming by application of a pressure of 0.1<br>
MPa to form a plate-like anode active material 42 (100 mm x 30 mm x 2 mm<br>
(thickness)).<br>
The cathode and anode active materials 40, 42 are each coated with an<br>
ion permeable current collector 44. For example, for the case of each plate-like<br>
active material, any surface(s) (from one to six surfaces) thereof may be coated with<br>
the ion permeable current collector 44. Additionally, in the active material forming<br>
step described above, the active material may be coated with an ion permeable<br>
current collector for integral formation. Furthermore, when using an active material<br>
in powder or paste form, it is advisable that the active material is filled in an ion<br>
permeable current collector in the form of a sack. In the present embodiment, for<br>
example, four of the surfaces of each of the plate-like cathode and anode active<br><br>
materials 40, 42 are coated with the ion permeable current collector 44 (a foamed<br>
nickel sheet). As the material of the ion permeable current collector that has voids<br>
therein, permits passage of ions therethrough, and is electrically conductive, a nickel<br>
metal mesh, a nickel-plated punching metal, a metal such as expanded metal, a<br>
nickel-plated foamed resin such as urethane, nickel-plated porous material such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, cotton, carbon fibers and the like, nickel-plated<br>
inorganic fibers made of silica, alumina and the like, nickel-plated organic fibers,<br>
nickel-plated felt, or nickel-plated foil made of inorganic substance such as mica,<br>
may be used in addition to the foamed nickel metal.<br>
A bellows-shaped separator 46 consisting of a material which undergoes<br>
no degeneration such as corrosion in an alkali electrolyte solution and which is<br>
capable of both providing electrical insulation and permitting passage of ions<br>
therethrough, is disposed. Cathode active materials 40 and anode active materials<br>
42, when loaded in the battery cell, are placed alternately on the contact side with a<br>
cathode current collector 48 and on the contact side with an anode current collector<br>
50, respectively, facing each other across the separator 46. A basic unit thus<br>
prepared is loaded, together with an electrolyte (KOH, NaOH, LiOH and the like)<br>
solution, between the cathode current collector 48 and the anode current collector<br>
50 in the battery cell to complete a battery. As the material of the separator 46, a<br>
textile or nonwoven cloth made of any one of polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, nylon and the like, or membrane filter may be used. As the material<br>
of each of the cathode current collector 48 and the anode current collector 50, a<br>
nickel metal plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron, nickel-plated<br>
stainless steel, nickel-plated carbon and the like may be used.<br>
The structure of the bellows-shaped unit, which is a basic unit, is not<br>
limited to the one made up of a pair of cathode active materials and a pair of anode<br>
active materials, as shown in Fig.6. The bellows-like unit may be produced by<br>
adequately selecting a structure. For example, the bellows-shaped unit may be<br>
formed using a minimum structure as shown in Figure 7 or a structure made up of<br>
any number of pairs of cathode and anode active materials.<br>
The details of the charging and discharging of the battery of the present<br>
invention will be describe below.<br><br>
CHARGING<br>
A voltage is applied to the battery for the supply of electrons from a power<br>
generating means (not shown) to the anode current collector 50. The electrons<br>
move from the anode current collector 50 to the anode active material 42 and react.<br>
Ions generated by the reaction pass through the separator 46, react with the<br>
cathode active material 40, and discharge electrons. These electrons move to the<br>
cathode current collector 48, and are delivered to the power generating means.<br>
DISCHARGING<br>
Electrons are supplied from a load to the cathode current collector 48.<br>
The electrons move from the cathode current collector 48 to the cathode active<br>
material 40 and react. Ions generated by the reaction pass through the separator<br>
46, react with the anode active material 42, and discharge electrons. These<br>
electrons move to the anode current collector 50, and are delivered to the load.<br>
In the battery in which the cathode active material 40 and the anode active<br>
material 42 are disposed facing each other across the bellows-shaped separator 46,<br>
the distance between the cathode active material 40 and the anode active material<br>
42 is short, and the distance for which electrons move becomes short, thereby<br>
achieving high output powers. In addition, the length for which ions diffuse<br>
becomes short, thereby achieving excellent diffusion of ions. Besides, when gas is<br>
generated from the active material because of overcharge or the like, the gas flows<br>
to its opposite electrode and is likely to be consumed easily, and sealing is<br>
established easily.<br>
In addition, if the cathode active material 40 and the anode active material<br>
44, both of which are covered with the ion permeable current collector 44 made of<br>
porous nickel, are used, this shortens the distance between the active material and<br>
the current collector, thereby making the moving distance of electrons shorter, and<br>
the current collecting area is increased. As a result, high performance batteries of<br>
small electrical resistance are obtained.<br>
Furthermore, since the separator 46 and the ion permeable current<br>
collector 44 exist relatively plentifully in the inside of the battery cell, the filling<br>
amount of the cathode and anode active materials 40, 42 per unit volume is small,<br>
thereby making it possible to hold a plenty of electrolytic solution within the cell.<br><br>
Accordingly, the dry out phenomenon, in which a solid-liquid reaction (a cell<br>
reaction) will no longer occur due to electrolytic solution depletion, is unlikely to<br>
occur.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, is shown an example of a second embodiment<br>
of the high power type three-dimensional battery in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In the present embodiment, a plurality of basic units (for example, four<br>
basic units in Fig. 8) are incorporated in parallel to constitute a battery. As a basic<br>
unit 52, a bellows-shaped basic unit as described in the first embodiment is<br>
produced. Four basic units 52 are loaded in parallel between the cathode current<br>
collector 48 and the anode current collector 50 for constitution of a battery.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, is shown an example of a third embodiment of the<br>
high power type three-dimensional battery in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In the present embodiment, a plurality of basic units (for example, four basic units<br>
in Fig. 9) are incorporated in parallel in the form of layers. A plurality of such layers<br>
(for example, four layers in Fig. 9) are placed one upon the other to constitute a<br>
battery. As the basic unit 52, a bellows-shaped basic unit as described in the first<br>
embodiment is produced. Four basic units 52 are loaded in parallel into a battery<br>
cell in the form of layers. Four such layers are placed one upon the other through<br>
respective dividing walls 54 to constitute a battery. If cells are placed in series one<br>
upon the other, this provides a high voltage battery. As the material of the dividing<br>
wall 54, a nickel metal plate, a nickel metal foil, carbon, nickel-plated iron,<br>
nickel-plated stainless steel, nickel-plated carbon, or the like may be used.<br>
As in the second and third embodiments, the arrangement that a plurality<br>
of bellows-shaped basic units are loaded in a battery cell makes it possible to easily<br>
achieve an increase in battery size and, in addition, since there are no welds<br>
causing the electrical resistance to increase, this prevents the drop in performance<br>
due to the increase in size. Additionally, it becomes possible to reduce production<br>
cost and production time.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, is shown an example of a fourth embodiment of the<br>
high power type three-dimensional battery in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In the present embodiment, a battery is constituted of a single basic unit and, in<br>
comparison with the first embodiment, the present embodiment employs a thicker<br><br>
active material in order to provide a battery with a great volume energy density.<br>
For example, for the case of nickel-hydrogen secondary batteries, 2000 g of nickel<br>
hydroxide powders, 200 g of EVA resin, and 300 g of electrically conductive filler<br>
(carbon black and carbon fibers) are mixed together. Thereafter, the mixture is<br>
subjected to pressurized forming by application of a pressure of 0.1 MPa to form a<br>
plate-like cathode active material 40 (100 mm x 30 mm x 12 mm (thickness)).<br>
Likewise, for example, 6000 g of hydrogen-occluding alloy powder, 200 g of EVA<br>
resin, and 300 g of electrically conductive filler (carbon black and carbon fibers) are<br>
mixed together. Thereafter, the mixture is subjected to pressurized forming by<br>
application of a pressure of 0.1 MPa to form a plate-like anode active material 42<br>
(100 mm x 30 mm x 8 mm (thickness)). As in the first embodiment, any surface(s)<br>
(for example, four surfaces) of each of the cathode and anode active materials 40,<br>
42 are coated with the ion permeable current collector 44, after which<br>
bellows-shaped cathode active materials 40 and anode active materials 42 are<br>
incorporated so that they face each other across the separator 46. The basic unit<br>
thus prepared is loaded, together with an electrolytic solution, between the cathode<br>
current collector 48 and the anode current collector 50 in the battery cell for<br>
constitution of a battery.<br>
If, as described above, the thickness of active material is increased, this<br>
relatively reduces the ratio of the separator 46 and the ion permeable current<br>
collector 44. As a result, despite the drop in output power per volume it becomes<br>
possible to obtain a battery having a high volume energy density. On the other<br>
hand, if the thickness of active material is reduced because high power battery<br>
performance is required in the aforesaid embodiments, this relatively increases the<br>
ratio of the separator 46 and the ion permeable type current collector 44. As a<br>
result, despite the drop in volume energy density it becomes possible to obtain a<br>
high power battery. As described above, any changes to the battery specification<br>
can be made just by increasing or decreasing the thickness of active material and<br>
the like, and desired battery specifications are obtained easily.<br>
Referring to Figures 11 and 12, is shown an example of a fifth embodiment<br>
of the high power type three-dimensional battery in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In a bellows-shaped unit (a basic unit) of the present embodiment<br><br>
comprising cathode and anode active materials which are so incorporated as to face<br>
each other across a separator, the number of cathode active materials is greater<br>
than the number of anode active materials by one, or vice versa, and either the<br>
cathode active materials or the anode active materials, whichever are greater in<br>
number, are disposed at each end of the basic unit.<br>
Referring to Figure 11, is shown a basic unit by way of example in which<br>
anode active materials 42 are disposed on both sides of a cathode active material<br>
40, with a bellow-shaped separator 46 sandwiched between the cathode active<br>
material 40 and each anode active material 42. Other structures and operations<br>
are the same as the first embodiment. In addition, the bellows-shaped basic unit of<br>
the present embodiment may be produced by adequately selecting a structure<br>
ranging from a minimum structure shown in Figure 11 to a structure provided with<br>
any arbitrary number of basic units.<br>
When achieving an increase in size by loading bellows-shaped basic units<br>
(as shown in Fig. 11) in parallel, it is necessary to load them in the way as shown in<br>
Figure 12.<br>
Referring to Figures 13 to 17, is shown examples of a sixth embodiment of<br>
the high power type three-dimensional battery in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In the sixth embodiment, an ion permeable current collector is disposed<br>
at a certain position in cathode active material and anode active material. Figure<br>
13 shows an example in which three surfaces of a plate-like anode active material<br>
42 are covered with an ion permeable current collector 44, indicating that any<br>
surface(s) of the cathode active material 40 and anode active material 42 can be<br>
coated with the ion permeable current collector 44. Figures 14-17 each show an<br>
example in which an ion permeable current collector 44 is disposed on a surface of<br>
the anode active material 42 and inside thereof, indicating that that the ion<br>
permeable current collectors 44 can be disposed at any place(s) of the cathode<br>
active material 40 and anode active material 42. Even in the case where an ion<br>
permeable current collector is disposed inside the cathode and anode active<br>
materials, the distance between the active material and the current collector is<br>
reduced and the moving distance of electrons is reduced. The current collector<br>
area increases and a high performance battery having a small electric resistance is<br><br>
obtained.<br>
Other structures and operations are the same as the first to fifth<br>
embodiments.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

and less assembly cost. The present invention further provides a three-dimensional<br>
