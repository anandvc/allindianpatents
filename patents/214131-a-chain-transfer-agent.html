"A CHAIN TRANSFER AGENT"<br>
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of America, and COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION of Limestone Avenue, Campbell, Act 2602, Australia<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
TITLE<br>
POLYMERIZATION PROCESS WITH LIVING CHARACTERISTICS<br>
AND POLYMERS MADE THEREFROM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a free radical polymerization process and particularly relates to a free radical polymerization process utilizing chain transfer agents (CTAs) and to polymers made therefrom.<br>
There is increasing interest in developing polymerization processes that can be predictably controlled to produce polymers having specifically desired structures. One of the means for achieving such results is through a process of living polymerization. Such a process provides a higher degree of control during the synthesis of polymers having predictably well defined structures and properties as compared to polymers made by conventional polymerization processes.<br>
Certain xanthate and dithiocarbamate derivatives of the following formula 1: <br>
where Q=0(alkyl) or N(alkyl)2, respectively have been shown to confer some of the characteristics of living polymerization when used as photoinitiators in polymerization processes (see for example Otsu et al., U.S. 5,314,962). Such a process where radicals are generated by direct photolysis of the xanthate or dithiocarbamate derivative do not form part of this invention. See also Niwa et al. (Makromol. Chem., 189, 2187 (1988)) and Otsu et al. (Macromolecules 19, 287 (1986)).<br>
Free radical polymerizations in the presence of chain transfer agents (CTAs) represented by formula 1 (where Q=Z" and R are as defined herein) have been disclosed by Le et al. in Int. Patent Application WO 98/01478, which discloses, that since dithiocarbamate and xanthate derivatives disclosed therein have very low transfer constants they are therefore ineffective in conferring living characteristics on a free radical polymerization. However, we have surprisingly found that by appropriate selection of substituents (Q) or the monomer these agents have high chain transfer constants and are effective in conferring living characteristics to a free radical polymerization. The CTAs of the present invention can also advantageously introduce novel end group functionalities into the resulting polymers.<br><br>

"Conjugating gioup" is one which provides orbital overlap between the C=S double bond and the lone pair of the S-R group, in the case of compounds of formula 2 described below, where D=D1, or to the nitrogen lone pair in the case of compounds of the formula 2, where D=D2, E=E1 thereby providing for delocalization of the associated electrons. Examples of such conjugating groups are provided in the subsequent text.<br>
"Substituted" means that a group may be substituted with one or more groups that are independently selected from the group that consisting of alkyl, aryl, epoxy, hydroxy, alkoxy, oxo, acyl, acyloxy, carboxy, carboxylate, sulfonic acid, sulfonate, alkoxy- or aryloxy-carbonyl, isocyanato, cyano, silyl, halo, dialkylamino, and amido. All substituents are chosen such that there is no substantial adverse interaction under the conditions of the experiment.<br>
We have discovered a novel free radical polymerization process and novel polymers produced therefrom. The process is directed to polymerizing a monomer mix in the presence of a source of free radicals and at least one of certain sulfur based CTAs chosen so as to confer living characteristics. By utilizing these CTAs, polymers of controlled molecular weight and low polydispersity can be obtained.<br>
The sulfur based CTAs suitable for use in the present invention have a chain transfer constants in the range of from 0.1 to 5000, preferably in the range of from 1 to 2000 and more preferably in the range of from 10 to 500. If the chain transfer constant of the CTA exceeds the upper limit of the range substantially no polymerization occurs, if it falls below the lower limit it is not possible to produce polymers having low polydispersity. The CTAs of the present invention generally<br><br>
should not copolymerize with monomers during the polymerization process. As a result, low polydispersity polymers based on monosubstituted monomers (e.g., acrylic monomers, styrene) can be made under a wide range of reaction conditions.<br>

E4 is of the following formula 14:<br><br>
wherein p"" is between 2 and 200 and G" * is Z". The foregoing CTAs are prepared by the following processes: Vinylogous dithioesters may be prepared in several ways. For example, 3-benzylthio-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-ene-l-thione is made by a multi-step process. First, piperidine is condensed with 5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-l,3-dione in the presence of a strong acid to form enaminoketone, which is then converted to a thione derivative. After the addition of benzyl chloride and hydrogen sulfide work-up, the 3-benzylthio-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-ene-l-thione is isolated as a purple oil.<br><br>
The preparation of benzyl 3,3-di(benzylthio)prop-2-enedithioate, another vinylogous dithioester, starts with addition of two moles of carbon disulfide to one mole of the Grignard reagent, such as, methyl magnesium chloride. Treatment with strong base at low temperature followed by addition of benzyl chloride results in the dithioate, which is an orange solid.<br>
The thiocarbonylthio compounds with alpha- nitrogen atoms are synthesized from the corresponding nitrogen compounds. For example, benzyl 1 -pyrrolecarbodithioate is prepared by adding pyrrole to sodium hydride suspension in dimethyl sulfoxide followed by the addition of carbon disulfide. Benzyl chloride is added and the product, benzyl 1-pyrrolecarbodithioate, is isolated by extraction with diethyl ether.<br>
The corresponding 2-pyrrolidineone derivative is prepared in a similar manner by starting with pyrrolidone instead of pyrrole.<br>

In the context of the present invention, low polydispersity polymers are  those with polydispersities that are significantly less than those produced by conventional free radical polymerization. In conventional free radical polymerization, polydispersities of the polymers formed are typically in the range 1.5 to 2.0 at low monomer conversions in the range of from 0.1 % to 10% and are substantially greater in the range of from 2 to 10 at higher monomer conversions<br><br>
in the range of from 10 % to 100%. Polymers having low polydispersity in the range of from 1.05 to 1.5 are preferred. Those having the polydispersity in the range of 1.05 to 1.3 are more preferred. Moreover, one of the significant advantages of the process of the preset invention is that the foregoing low polydispersity can be maintained even at high monomer conversions of in the range of from 10% to 100%.<br>
However, it should be understood, it is also possible, if desired, to produce polymers with broad, yet controlled, polydispersity or multimodal molecular weight distribution by controlled addition of the CTA over the course of the polymerization process of the present invention.<br>
The invention can be used to narrow the polydispersity of polymers formed in polymerizations that would otherwise produce polymers of broad or very broad polydispersities. In this circumstance a preferred polydispersity is one which is less than that formed in the absence of the CTA .<br>
While not wishing to be limited to any particular mechanism, it is believed that the mechanism of the process is as summarized in Scheme 1 below. Propagating radicals Pn* are produced by radical polymerization. These can react reversibly with the chain transfer agent RA to form an intermediate radical PnA(*)R which fragments to give a radical R (which adds monomer to reinitiate polymerization) and a new transfer agent PnA. This new transfer agent PnA has similar characteristics to the original transfer agent RA in that it reacts with another propagating radical Pm* to form an intermediate radical PnA(*)Pm which fragments to regenerate Pn* and form a new transfer agent PmA which has similar characteristics to RA. This process provides a mechanism for chain equilibration and accounts for the polymerization having living characteristics.<br><br>
Pn* and Pm# are propagating radicals of chain length n and m respectively. R9 is a chain transfer agent derived radical which can initiate polymerization to produce a new propagating radical. RA, PnA and PmA are<br>
CTAs.<br>
The molecular weight and the polydispersity of the polymer made by the process of the present invention are controlled by one or more of the following:<br><br>
The polymerization conditions are selected to minimize the number of chains formed from initiator-derived radicals to an extent consistent with obtaining an acceptable rate of polymerization. Termination of polymerization by idical-radical reaction will lead to chains.which contair no active group and tnerefore cannot be reactivated. The rate of radical-radical termination is proportional to the square of the radical concentration. Furthermore, in the synthesis of block, star or branched polymers, chains formed from initiator-derived radicals will constitute a linear homopolymer impurity in the final product. These reaction conditions therefore require careful choice of the initiator concentration and, where appropriate, the rate of the initiator feed.<br>
It is also desirable to choose other components of the polymerization<br>
medium (for example, the solvents, surfactants, additives, and initiator) such that<br>
they have a low transfer constant towards the propagating radical. Chain transfer<br>
to these species will lead to the formation of chains which do not contain the<br>
active group.	<br>
As a general guide in chposing conditions for the polymerization of narrow polydispersity polymers, the concentration of initiator(s) and other reaction conditions [solvent(s) if any, reaction temperature, reaction pressure, surfactants if any, other additives] should be chosen such that the molecular weight of polymer formed in the absence of the CTA is at least twice that formed in its presence. In polymerizations where radical-radical termination is solely by disproportionation, this equates to choosing an initiator concentration such that the total moles of initiating radicals formed during the polymerization is in the range of 0.000001 times to 0.5 times that of the total moles of CTA. More preferably, conditions should be chosen such that the molecular weight of polymer formed in the absence of the,CTA is at least 5-fold that formed in its presence ([initiating radicals]/[CTA] 
Thus, by varying the ratio of the total number of moles of the CTA to me total number of moles of the free radical initiator added to a polymerization medium, the polydispersity of the resulting polymer is controlled. Thus, by decreasing the foregoing ratio, a polymer of lower polydispersity is obtained and by increasing the ratio, a polymer of higher polydispersity is obtained.<br>
With these provisos, the polymerization process according to the present invention is performed under the conditions typical of conventional free-radical polymerization. Polymerization employing the CTAs of the present invention is suitably carried out with temperatures during the reaction in the range -20 °C to 200 °C, preferably in the range 40 to 160 °C.<br><br>
Unlike, a conventional free radical polymerization process, the molecular weight of the resulting polymer by the process of the present invention generally increases in a predictable and linear fashion, and may be estimated in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br>
where MWprod is the number average molecular weight of the isolated polymer, MWmon is  the molecular weight of the monomer and MWcta is the molecular weight of the CTA. The foregoing expression applies under reaction conditions where the number of initiator-derived chains is less than 10 percent with respect to total chains and when the added CTA is completely reacted. More complex expressions may be derived to enable prediction of the molecular weight in other circumstances.<br>
By way of illustration, consider the data provided in Examples 19 and 20. A close correspondence is seen between molecular weights calculated according to the above equation and those found experimentally.<br><br>
The process of this invention can be carried out in emulsion, solution or suspension in either a batch, semi-batch, continuous, or feed mode. Otherwise-conventional procedures can be used to produce narrow polydispersity polymers. For lowest polydispersity polymers, the CTA is added before polymerization is commenced. For example, when carried out in batch mode in solution, the reactor is typically charged with CTA and monomer or medium plus monomer. To the mixture is then added the desired amount of initiator and the mixture is heated for a time which is dictated by the desired conversion and molecular weight.<br><br>
Polymers with broad, yet controlled, polydispersity or with multimodal molecular weight distribution can be produced by controlled addition of the CTA over the course of the polymerization process.<br>
In the case of emulsion or suspension polymerization the polymerization medium will often be pred6minantly water and the conventional stabilizers, dispersants and other additives can be present.<br>
For solution polymerization, the polymerization medium can be chosen from a wide range of media to suit the monomer(s) being used. For example, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, petroleum naphtha or xylenes; ketones, such as, methyl amyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone or acetone; esters, such as, butyl acetate or hexyl acetate; and glycol ether esters, such as, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate.<br>
As has already been stated, the use of feed polymerization conditions allows the use of CTAs with lower transfer constants and allows the synthesis of polymers that are not readily achieved using batch polymerization processes. If the polymerization is carried out as a feed system the reaction can be carried out as follows. The reactor is charged with the chosen polymerization medium, the CTA and optionally a portion of the monomer mixture. Into a separate vessel is placed the remaining monomer mixture. The free radical initiator is dissolved or suspended in polymerization medium in another separate vessel. The medium in the reactor is heated and stirred while the monomer mixture + medium and initiator + medium are introduced, for example by a syringe pump or other pumping device. The rate and duration of feed is determined largely by the quantity of solution, the desired monomer/CTA/initiator ratio and the rate of the polymerization. When the feed is complete, heating may be continued for an additional period. Sequential addition of different monomers will give a block or gradient copolymer.<br>
Following completion of the polymerization, the polymer can be isolated by stripping off the medium and unreacted monomer(s) or by precipitation with a non-solvent. Alternatively, the polymer solution/emulsion can be used as such, if appropriate to its application.<br>
The process of the present invention is compatible with a wide variety of monomers and can be used under varied reaction conditions to produce polymers having low polydispersity. By varying the rate of monomer(s) addition or by varying the sequence in which the monomer(s) may be added to the polymerization medium, the process present invention may be used to produce block and multi-block and gradient polymers. By selecting the functionalities<br><br>
desired, an end-functional polymer of specific end functionalities can be readily produced.<br>
when in the formula 32, p = n and R is of the following formula 43:<br>
Examples of CTAs of the formula 6 which are precursors to graft polymers of formula 32, which include copolymers and/or xanthate or dithiocarbamate derivative of the following formula -<br><br><br>
Examples of CTAs containing functionality attached to a common nucleus are described below.<br>
When in the formula 6 p=2, R= p-xylylene, the CTA is of the formula 44 below: <br>
and when in the formula 10, p""= 2, E=E4, G"" = p-phenylene then the CTA is of the formula 45 below:<br><br>
The compound of the following formula (46) will provide a star polymer, as shown below:<br><br><br>
When in the formula 6, p=4 and R is of the following formula 47 below:<br><br>
The polydispersity obtained under a given set of reaction conditions is sensitive to the value of the transfer constant (Ctr). Lower polydispersities will result from the use of CTAs with higher transfer constants. According to the above mechanism, the chain transfer activities of the reagents (RA, PnA and pmA) will be determined by the reactivity of the C=S double bond and by the rate of fragmentation and the partitioning of the intermediate radicals between starting materials and products.<br>
Miiller et al. have derived relationships which enable polydispersities to be estimated for polymerizations which involve chain equilibration by reversible chain transfer (Miiller, A.H.E.; Zhuang, R.; Yan, D.; Lkvenko, G. Macromolecules, 28, 4326 (1995))<br><br>
Where Ctr is the chain transfer constant.<br>
This above relationship should apply to batch polymerizations carried to full conversion in the situation where the number of initiator-radical derived chains is small with respect to total chains and there are no side reactions. This relationship suggests that the transfer constant should be greater than 2 to obtain a polydispersity 
For a feed polymerization in which the monomer concentration is kept constant by continual replenishment, Miiller et al. suggest that the following relationship should hold (Miiller, A. H. E.; Litvenko, G., Macromolecules 30, 1253 (1997)):<br><br><br>
Where Ctr is the chain transfer constant and DPn is the degree of polymerization of the product.<br>
A possible mechanism of the addition-fragmeraation step, without reliance thereon, for the case of compounds of the formula 2 where D is D1 is as follows: <br>
The foregoing proposed mechanism is in accord with experimental observations. According to this mechanism, the X group may in principle be any group which maintains conjugation between the C=S and the S-R groups. Some possible structures are included in the following formulas 48-50:<br><br><br>
Structures containing multiple alkylthio groups allow the synthesis of polymers of more complex architecture. For example the following compound can give rise to a three arm star 54 as follows:<br><br>
Sequential addition of monomers will give rise to block copolymers.<br>
It will be clear to those skilled in the art that to be effective as a CTA in the present invention, the group R of the CTA must be both a free radical leaving group and a species that initiates free radical polymerization. Leaving group ability is determined both by steric factors and by radical stability. Examples of preferred R groups for the CTA are benzyl derivatives (-CR""2Ph) and cyanoalkyl derivatives (-CR""2CN) and other moieties known to the art as free radical leaving groups. "<br>
The leaving group ability of R will also be determined by the nature of the propagating species formed in the polymerization. For example, in styrene polymerization, R is preferably selected from the group consisting of benzyl, 1-phenylethyl, 2-phenylpropyl, 2-(alkoxycarbonyI)prop-2-yl, 2-cyanoprop-2-yl, 2-cyanobut-2-yl, and l-cyanocyclohexyl. In methyl methacrylate polymerization R is preferrably selected from the group consisting of 2-phenylpropyl, 2-cyanoprop-2-yI, 2-cyanobut-2-yl, and 1-cyanocyclohexyl. In vinyl acetate polymerization R is preferrably selected from the group consisting of 2-(alkoxycarbonyl)prop-2-yl, cyanomethyl, 2-cyanoprop-2-yl, 2-cyanobut-2-yl, and l-cyanocyclohexyl.<br>
To avoid retardation the R"", substituents should be chosen such that R gives facile addition to the monomer. In this context, the preferred R"" groups are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and substituted alkyl. The ability of R to initiate polymerization will be determined by the nature of the monomers used in the polymerization. In polymerization of styrene and methacrylates benzyl derivatives (-CR""2Ph) and cyanoalkyl derivatives (-CR""2CN) are effective. However, in vinyl acetate polymerization benzyl derivatives (-CR""2Ph) are slow to initiate polymerization, and retardation may be observed, but cyanoalkyl derivatives (-CR""2CN) and the corresponding esters (-CR""2CO2Alkyl) are effective.<br>
In polymerizations of (meth)acrylates and styrene, we have discovered that dithiocarbamate CTAs (formula 2, D=D2, E=E1) with conjugating or electron withdrawing substituents at the dithiocarbamate nitrogen are substantially more effective than dithiocarbamate derivatives with simple alkyl substituents.<br><br>
Thus, the preferred groups in E1 for this application are aromatic nitrogen heterpcycles where G-N-J forms part of aromatic cyclic group, such as those of the following formulas 55 and 56 below:<br><br>
and groups in E1 such as cyclic amides where G-N-J forms part of a non-aromatic cyclic group with substituent such as oxo conjugated to nitrogen as in the following formulas 57-59 below:<br><br>
One possible explanation for the greater activity of the above dithiocarbamates is in terms of a higher reactivity of the C=S double bond towards free radical addition. This is attributed to the effect of the conjugating or electron withdrawing substituents giving greater double bond character to the C=S double bond.<br>
In carbamates and amides the N-CO link has partial double bond character as a result of the delocalisation of the non-bonded nitrogen lone pair with the p electrons of carbonyl group (Deslongchamps, P. Stereoelectronic effects in organic chemistry, Pergamon Press, NY, 1983). As a result, the oxygen of the carbonyl group has a partial negative charge. Since sulfur has a higher electron affinity than oxygen, this effect would be expected to be more pronounced in dithiocarbamates.<br>
If the nitrogen lone pair participates in an alternate π-system (e.g. the aromatic pyrrole ring) the lone pair will be less available for delocalization into the thiocarbonyl bond resulting in a greater double bond character for the C=S double bond and hence a greater reactivity of the CTA towards radicals.<br>
Similar considerations apply in the case of xanthate esters. We have found that effectiveness of xanthate ester CTAs (formula 2, D=D2, E=E2) in providing low polydispersity polymers in acrylate polymerization increases in the series where G" is <br><br>
The transfer constants of dithiocarbamate and xanthate derivatives (compounds of formula 2 D=D2, E= E1 or E2 repectively) are strongly dependent on the monomer used. Thus dithiocarbamate and xanthate derivatives of formula 2 with D=D2 and E=E1 or E2 wherein G, J, and G" are independently selected from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkylene, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl have relatively low transfer constants in polymerization of methacrylate or styrene monomers and are not effective in giving narrow polydispersity polymers in batch polymerization of such monomers.<br>
However in polymerization of vinyl acetate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, vinyl fluoride, N-vinylpyrolidone, N-vinylcarbazole and similar vinyl monomers these dithiocarbamate and xanthate derivatives (compounds of formula 2, D=D2, E= El or E2) have higher transfer constants enabling low polydispersity polymers to be achieved. Preferred CTAs for use with these vinyl monomers include compounds of formula 2 with D=D2 and E=E1 or E2 wherein G, J, and G" are independently selected from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstituted alkyl,substituted or unsubstituted alkylene, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl, or when E=E1, G-N-J forms part of a non-aromatic cyclic group.<br>
The invention has wide applicability in the field of free radical polymerization and can be used to produce polymers that are suitable for use in compositions for coatings, including automotive OEM and refinishes, as primers, basecoats, undercoats, overcoats and clear coats. The polymers are also suitable for use in compositions for maintenance finishes for a wide variety of substrates, such as steel, copper, brass and aluminum or non-metallic substrates, such as, wood, leather and concrete.<br>
A coating composition containing the polymer prepared by the process of the present invention may also contain conventional additives, such as, pigments, stabilizers, flow agents, toughening agents, fillers, durability agents, corrosion and oxidation inhibitors, rheology control agents, metallic flakes and other additives. Such additional additives will, of course, depend on the intended use of the coating composition.
