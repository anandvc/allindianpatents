METHOD OF PEER-TO-PEER CONNECTING DEVICES IN DYNAMIC HOME NETWORKING<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a computer network technique, more particularly, to a method of peer-to-peer connecting devices when  implementing dynamic networking and resource sharing in a home network. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
With the rapid development of computer and network technologies and individual requirements to digitalization and informatization of lives, Home Network (such as Smart Home, Electronic Home, e-Home, Digital Family, Network Home, and Intelligent Home) has been developed as a hot technique. The home network technique is a key one for implementing digitalization of home devices. With this technique, all electrical devices in a home can be connected as a whole so as to achieve device interconnection and information transmission at anytime and anywhere. The requirements to the home network are completely different from those to a commercial network, such as it does not need any additional wiring, and should be easy to use, low cost and so on. The existing network techniques suitable to home device interconnection such as HomePNA can implement interconnections of digital devices by means of existing telephone line of each home, and easy to use without influencing normal reception of a call. The automatic control of home electrical appliances can be conveniently implemented by networking with a power line equipped in the home in which signals and data are transmitted.<br>
Fig.l shows a topological structure of digital home network architecture, hierarchically including a backbone network and a control subnet. The networking forms of a home backbone network includes two parts of a wired access (a wired backbone network) and a wireless access (a wireless backbone network) (in order to implement interconnections of some wireless devices and make users enjoy information access without limitation of time and location, the wireless backbone network is an indispensable part of the home backbone network). Generally, in the backbone network, there is one home network server 101 which is a processing center and a storing center of the digital home and can be one PC device or a dedicated server. A home gateway 102 in the backbone network is used to effect the interconnections among an internal device 104 of the home network and a mobile device 103 and a broadband access of the<br><br>
home such that the devices 103 and 104 in the home backbone network can share the information from Internet 105. The home backbone network constitutes a home information/multimedia network and implements the interconnections and resource sharing among information devices, communication devices, entertainment devices and the like. The preliminary data transmitted by the home backbone network are text, picture, audio and video etc.<br>
The control subnet is used to effect the interconnections among devices (108) such as home electrical appliances, automatic devices and security (monitoring) apparatuses; its constitution is an important premise for achieving home automation. The data transmitted in the control subnet are mainly various control instructions to devices and status data of devices. A control gateway 106 in the control subnet, on one hand, implements the interconnections among various home devices 108, and on the other hand, implements the interconnections between the control subnet and the backbone network, and also provides external interfaces for a remote telephone alarm and a telephone remote control (implemented with Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 107).<br>
The interactions between the home backbone network and the Internet 105 have two hierarchical meanings: (1) a user may invoke services on the home backbone network remotely through the Internet; and (2) the user may access services on the Internet through the home backbone network.<br>
The interactions between the home backbone network and the home control subnet are implemented by the control gateway 106. The control gateway 106 is responsible for performing protocol conversion between the backbone network and the control subnet such that the services in the control subnet are represented as services in the home backbone network. The operations to devices and services in the control subnet are converted into the operations to the corresponding services on the control gateway 106. In control subnet protocols, the descriptions about services are all described based on XML language. With respect to services in the control subnet, the control gateway 106 generates corresponding XML descriptions and these services are registered as backbone network services onto the control gateway 106.<br>
In order to make users enjoy entertainments freely and lives comfortable, those various and complex electrical devices in home must be interconnected organically and cooperated. Therefore, in the backbone network of the home network architecture, the<br><br>
objects of high-rates transmission, high-quality services, dynamic networking and effective resource sharing of the home backbone network will be achieved by designing a reasonable and effective method (backbone network protocols) for dynamic networking and sharing resources among the devices.<br>
In the present invention, supporting dynamic networking among various devices in home refers to that without performing network parameters configuration in a manual manner in advance, a device in the network can dynamically select relevant devices from the network so as to form a home network, which is used to implement a function that cannot be fulfilled with any single device, or to improve the performance of an original function of any single device. Resource sharing means that a device in the network can issue resources provided by itself, and can also retrieve and utilize resources provided by other devices. A direct communication and resource sharing between any two devices are implemented to extent the functions of single device. A method for implementing dynamic networking and resource sharing among devices in a home backbone network may include the steps of:<br>
A.	connecting a home backbone network device to a local area network or a wireless<br>
local area network;<br>
B.	announcing its device information from the device by issuing announcement<br>
message in a multicasting manner;<br>
C.	acquiring existence messages of other devices, by the device, in an intercepting or<br>
searching manner;<br>
D.	constituting a home network, by a service utilizing device or a service providing<br>
device, together with a resource management device through registering to the resource<br>
management device; or constituting a home network, by more than one service utilizing<br>
devices or service providing devices, in a peer-to-peer connecting manner;<br>
E.	acquiring service information of service providing devices within the home network,<br>
by the service utilizing device which joins into the home network, through initiating a<br>
service searching request to the resource management device, and acquiring a service<br>
utilizing right for utilizing a found service providing device and the provided service<br>
through initiating a service renting request and a service invoking request to the service<br>
providing device; or acquiring, by the service utilizing device, service information and<br>
a service utilizing right for utilizing service of a service providing device which has<br>
established a peer-to-peer connection relation with the service utilizing device through<br><br>
initiating a service searching request, a service renting request and a service invoking<br>
request to the service providing device, and whereby acquiring utilization of the service<br>
provided by the service providing device.<br>
Actually, the implementing procedure of service utilizing devices or service providing<br>
devices constituting a home network in a peer-to-peer connecting manner in step D of<br>
the above solution is the method of peer-to-peer connecting the devices during dynamic<br>
networking to be solved by the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The key idea of a home network is to implement interconnection and communication as<br>
well as resource sharing among devices dynamically. When there is a master control<br>
device,   that   is,   a  resource   management   device,   in   the   network,   a  centralized<br>
management to devices can be achieved by registration and cancellation procedures of<br>
the master control device to various devices in the network. However, not in all home<br>
network  environments,  there  will  be  a  stationary  resource  management  device.<br>
Therefore, the method according to the present invention is adapted to a home network<br>
environment without a resource management device. A simple device management is<br>
achieved by a peer-to-peer connecting mechanism among peer-to-peer devices so as to<br>
achieve the interconnection and communication as well as resource sharing among<br>
devices.<br>
For the convenience of describing the inventive device peer-to-peer connecting method,<br>
the home network structure of Fig. 1 can be simplified as the structure as shown in Fig.<br>
2.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a plurality of information devices are included in the composition<br>
of home electrical appliances, for example, a peer-to-peer device 1 (21), a peer-to-peer<br>
device 2 (22), a peer-to-peer device 3 (23) and a peer-to-peer device 4 (24). A<br>
peer-to-peer device can refer to either a service providing device or a service utilizing<br>
device. There is no resource management device in a peer-to-peer connected home<br>
network.<br>
In the method according to the invention, when a peer-to-peer device connection is<br>
performed, there is one connection initiating device and one connection target device.<br>
In which, the connection target device is designated by the connection initiating device.<br>
A  piece   of software   is   necessarily   added   into   the   both   devices   to   perform<br>
communications therebetween so as to implement a peer-to-peer connection.<br>
A device discovering procedure is prior to the connection of devices, and is performed<br>
between  the  connection  initiating device  and the connection target device.  The<br><br>
connection initiating device firstly discovers the connection target device through the device discovering procedure, and whereby can start a device connecting procedure. As described in the Background of The Invention, in the implementing method of dynamic networking and resource sharing, steps B and C are the device discovering procedure, and include two procedures of device announcing and device searching. When the devices in the home network are powered on, the software running thereon announces its own existence information and relevant security requirement information into the network in a multicasting manner according to the device announcing method. The devices in the network can acquire the existence information of other devices by intercepting such device announcement information (including type of device, IP address of device and service information provided by the device). The devices in the network can send device searching information in a multicasting manner. When a device receiving the multicast searching information finds that its own conditions is consistent with the searching conditions in the searching request, it returns announcement information of itself in a unicasting manner. By means of such device announcing and device searching steps, all devices in the home network can discover each other.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the steps as shown represent a connecting procedure of peer-to-peer devices. The connecting procedure starts with sending a device connecting request, by a connection initiating device, to a connection target device.<br>
If the security property of a service providing device is set as that authentication is needless (which is set in the device announcement), then the service providing device allows connection creating request of anyone of service utilizing devices, and sends a connection creating response message to the service utilizing device. If the security property of a service providing device is set as that authentication is needed (which is set in the device announcement), the service providing device and the service utilizing device apply a connection creation process in accordance with the steps shown in the drawing. An entire device connecting procedure includes 8 steps of key configuration and connection request sending, connection request processing, connection challenge value sending, connection challenge value processing, connection reply value sending, connection reply value processing, connection response value sending, and connection response value processing.<br><br>
Before performing Step 1, a device information setting and a key configuration are necessarily performed. The administrator of the home network performs connection setting for all devices (connection initiating devices and connection target devices) desiring to support peer-to-peer connections, which includes configuring account information allowing to connect which comprises user name and password for all devices, in which when the devices themselves have a human-machine interface, the configuration is performed through the human-machine interface, whereas for those devices without a human-machine interface, a remote setting to them can be performed through a device with a human-machine interface; and further configuring an allowed maximum parallel connection number for each device.<br>
In Step 1, key configuration and connection request sending, a connection initiating device (such as a service utilizing device) sends it to a connection target device (such as a service providing device), the device connecting procedure starts. The device connecting request information sent from the connection initiating device to the connection target device includes four fields of type of message, serial number of message, user name and serial number of connection request. The names, content and value ranges of respective fields are as shown in the following table.<br><br>
In Step 2, connection request processing, the connection target device conducts processing. When the connection target device receives the connection request from the connection initiating device, it firstly judges whether the number of connection initiating devices currently connected with the present connection target device has reached the upper limit of the allowed connection number. If so, it returns a connection response message whose connecting result is overload (OVERLOAD) in a subsequent step, and this device connecting procedure is ended. Otherwise, it further judges<br><br>
whether the user information of the connection initiating device is in the present connection target device according to the user information indicated in the device connecting request. If not so, then it returns a connection response message whose connecting result is denial of access (ACCESSDENIED). Otherwise, a challenge value whose length is 32 bits are randomly generated, and based on which, a connection challenge value message is generated in order to be sent to the connection initiating device, and the challenge value is also saved for later usages (such as waiting for the arrival of a response value so as to make a comparison).<br>
In Step 3, connection challenge value sending, the connection target device sends it to the connection initiating device.<br>
The procedure of sending the connection challenge value is also the procedure of the service providing device sending the connection creating response message to the service utilizing device. The connecting result is included in the response message in order to notify the service utilizing device of carrying out corresponding process according to the result. The response message also includes an identity authenticating algorithm identifier ID used by the service providing device and the challenge value Challenge Value randomly selected by the service utilizing device. The names, contents and value ranges of respective fields of the connection creating response message are as shown in the following table.<br><br>
In Step 4, connection challenge value processing, it is carried out by the connection initiating device. After receiving the connection challenge value message, the connection   initiating   device   should   retrieve  whether  there   is   key   information<br><br>
corresponding to the challenge value in the device itself. If there isn't, then the present connection is failed, and the present connecting procedure is ended. Otherwise, a reply value (a response value, Response) should be generated in accordance with the security mechanism according to the challenge value and the key (after receiving the identity authenticating algorithm identifier ID and the challenge value, the connection initiating device encrypts the challenge value with its own key), and is sent to the connection target device.<br>
In Step 5, connection reply value sending, after generating the connection reply value, the connection initiating device sends it to the connection target device. This connection reply message includes four fields of type of message, serial number of message, serial number of connection request and reply value. The names, contents and value ranges of respective fields are as shown in the following table.<br><br>
In Step 6, connection reply value processing, it is carried out by the connection target device. After receiving the connection reply value sent from the connection initiating device, the connection target device should judge whether this reply value is valid according to the saved challenge value and its corresponding key. If it is valid, the connection target device sends a connection response message containing success of connection to the connection initiating device; otherwise, a connection response message containing information about wrong key is sent. Specifically, the connection target device decrypts the challenge value with a shared key KeylD corresponding to the ID announced by the connection initiating device. If Response = Encrypt (KeylD, Challenge Value), then the connection is allowed to be created, and also a response of connection success is sent to the connection initiating device, and the environment of connection is prepared. If Response o Encrypt (KeylD, Challenge Value), then the connection is not allowed to be created, and also a response of creation failure is sent to the service utilizing device, and the information corresponding to the device is deleted.<br><br>
If the connection target device regards that the present connection is successful, then<br>
the connection numbers of both devices connected should be increased.<br>
In which, the judgment whether the configuration of the key and the reply value is valid<br>
or not should be carried out in accordance with the security mechanism.<br>
In Step 7, connection response message sending, the connection target device sends it<br>
to the connection initiating device. The connection target device sends a connection<br>
response message according to the result of reply value processing. The connection<br>
response message includes four fields of type of message, serial number of message,<br>
serial number of connection response message and connecting result. The names,<br>
contents and value ranges of respective fields are as shown in the following table.<br><br>
In Step 8, connection response message processing, it is carried out by the connection initiating device. After receiving the connection response message, the connection initiating device can immediately judge the present connection is successful or not. After the connection relation is established between two devices, a connection disconnection can be performed at anytime. The connection disconnection includes two steps of connection disconnecting request and connection disconnecting request message processing.<br>
During the connection disconnecting request, any one of the devices (the initiating connection device or the target connection device) can both initiate a connection disconnecting request to the other device at any time to disconnect the established connection. The sent connection disconnecting request message includes three fields of type of message, serial number of message and reason for disconnecting connection (normal or protoerror). The names, contents and value ranges of respective fields are as shown in the following table.<br><br><br>
In order to ensure that no fraudulent device connection disconnecting request occurs, the sending of the device connection disconnecting request should be transmitted according to the encrypting method defined in the security mechanism. During the connection disconnecting message processing, when any one of the devices with an established connection relation receives the connection disconnecting request from the other device, it regards that the present connection is disconnected, and at the same time, the both devices should decrease the connection numbers thereof. In the inventive method, the devices in the network are managed, connection and disconnection among various devices are implemented and the dynamic networking and resource sharing in the extent of home network when there is not resource management device are achieved by means of a peer-to-peer connection mechanism cooperating with the home backbone network protocol.<br><br><br><br><br>
