				<td>Method of Producing Bristles for Applying Media,<br>
Bristles Produced in Accordance with the Method<br>
and Brushes Comprising such Bristles<br>
The invention concerns a method of producing bristles for<br>
applying media through extrusion of a filament which can be<br>
cut into bristles and provided with recesses for receiving<br>
the medium and from which the medium is discharged during<br>
proper use of the bristles, as well as a bristle and brushes<br>
comprising such bristles produced in accordance with this<br>
method.<br>
Brushes comprising bristles for applying liquid, viscous or<br>
powdery media are used mainly for body, hair and mouth cara<br>
but also in the household and for technical applications. The<br>
invention is described below mainly in connection with tooth<br>
brushes, one of the main fields of application.<br>
Tooth brushes are known which highlight film on the teeth<br>
through application of a suitable indicating color to allow<br>
the user of the tooth brush to increase brushing of such<br>
indicated tooth locations (DE 195 45 644). Towards this end,<br>
the brushes are coated with the indicating color or with<br>
microcapsules containing the color and the coating is<br>
optionally sealed. A hollow brush with inserted indicating<br>
medium is also described in this connection. This document<br>
does not explain in detail how these hollow brushes are<br>
filled. It is further known (CA 549 168) to jacket the<br>
brushes of a single-use tooth brush with a tooth care medium.<br>
Bristles are also known (US 5,678,275) whose circumference is<br>
provided with irregularly shaped grooves. They do not<br>
accommodate media but are supposed to accept soilage<br>
particles to remove them from the mouth during brushing of<br>
the teeth.<br>
It is furthermore known (WO 98/24341) to accommodate<br>
therapeutically effective or other media having dental<br>
medical effects in a hollow brush which are released at the<br>
free open end of the brush during use. The hollow brush is<br>
optionally reinforced by radial walls such that it comprises<br>
three or four chambers with parallel axes. The desired media<br>
are introduced in liquid form. Towards this end, filaments<br>
having the cross-sectional shape of the finished bristles are<br>
extruded and several filaments are combined into multi-veined<br>
strands having a diameter up to 5.5 cm and a length up to 1.2<br>
m. One end of the strand is dipped into the liquid medium and<br>
suction is applied to the opposite open ends of the<br>
filaments. Since a high suction pressure is required due to<br>
the capillary cavities and the large strand length and since<br>
collapsing of the walls due to the elasticity of a suitable<br>
plastic must be prevented, the wall must be quite thick and<br>
complete filling of the hollow bristles is not possible.<br>
Viscous or dispersed media cannot be introduced into the<br>
capillary cavities due to the high pressure drop. During use<br>
of the bristle, the medium is only discharged via the open<br>
end of the bristles and is therefore fully undefined and<br>
incomplete.<br>
It is the underlying purpose of the invention to propose a<br>
method for economical introduction of media of arbitrary<br>
consistency and effect into a bristle and for discharge<br>
thereof in a desired dosage during the useful life of the<br>
bristle.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in<br>
that the filament is extruded having a core which also<br>
determines the mechanical properties of the bristle, wherein<br>
recesses are formed at a separation from the center of the<br>
core which open towards the circumference of the filament and<br>
which can be filled with medium from the outside, wherein the<br>
circumferential openings of the recesses are formed such that<br>
the medium is discharged only when the bristle is<br>
appropriately used.<br>
In the inventive method, the media is externally introduced<br>
into the recesses which are open to the outside, i.e. they<br>
must not be suctioned via a pressure drop over a relatively<br>
large distance, which would entail corresponding pressure<br>
losses. The recesses may therefore be advantageously filled<br>
at constant medium density. The consistency of the medium is<br>
not important for introduction. It can be liquid, viscous or<br>
disperse. Discharge occurs directly through the<br>
circumferential openings during use: they are sufficiently<br>
narrow to retain the medium and are discharged only during<br>
use, e.g. via the forces applied during brushing or through<br>
media present at the location of use which interact with the<br>
medium in the brush and rinse or dissolve same, i.e. saliva<br>
or a tooth care medium for tooth brushes and, in the simplest<br>
case, water or moisture for cleaning brushes.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the method proposes<br>
extrusion of the filament with a core which also determines<br>
the mechanical properties of the bristle, with formation of<br>
the recesses at a separation from the center of the core, the<br>
recesses opening towards the circumference of the filament<br>
and being filled with the medium from the outside, wherein<br>
the filament is subsequently provided, at least in parts,<br>
with a layer which at least partially covers the openings and<br>
controls discharge of the medium under normal conditions of<br>
brush use. In this method, the shape of the circumferential<br>
opening and the opening width are less decisive. The<br>
selection of the material of the layer, its thickness and the<br>
extent to which the recesses containing the medium are<br>
covered can control discharge of the medium over time and in<br>
dependence on how long brushes having such bristles are used.<br>
If the recesses are preferably closed by a jacket, the medium<br>
can be discharged via the open bristle end or through the<br>
openings in the recesses exposed during slow wear of the<br>
jacket or also by diffusion through the jacket, wherein the<br>
jacket may have a thinner wall than the bristle in accordance<br>
with WO 98/24341, since it is not subjected to pressure<br>
during filling.<br>
It is particularly economical when the recesses are formed<br>
during extrusion of the filament. Therein, the recesses are<br>
preferably formed with substantially parallel axes,<br>
optionally at a separation from one another.<br>
Another variant consists in that the recesses are formed<br>
after extrusion of the filament which would permit a<br>
substantially radial formation of recesses having arbitrary<br>
contour and arrangement.<br>
Both above-mentioned method variants may provide that the<br>
recesses are formed as capillary gaps extending from the<br>
center of the core towards the outside or that the recesses<br>
are formed as channels with openings which narrow into a gap<br>
at the circumference. The capillary gaps produce a retaining<br>
effect for the medium and same is discharged only under<br>
conditions of use, e.g. bristle pressure, added external<br>
media, or the like.<br>
The shape and/or width of the gaps is preferably adjusted to<br>
the consistency of the medium. It is furthermore advantageous<br>
to form the gaps such that they are completely closed in the<br>
unloaded state and open only under pressure.<br>
In a particularly economic fashion, the recesses which open<br>
to the outside can be filled in continuous operation on an<br>
endless filament, wherein the filament is guided through an<br>
optionally pressurized medium bath or through a cross-<br>
section, tapering like a nozzle, with the medium being<br>
supplied about the circumference. If the opening width of the<br>
recesses is large enough and the consistency of the medium<br>
sufficiently viscous, filling may also be effected without<br>
pressure during continuous operation. In this case, it is<br>
advisable to subsequently close the recesses with a jacket<br>
disposed on the filament.<br>
The jacket preferably consists of a synthetic thermoplastic<br>
material which is extruded onto the filament, filled with the<br>
medium. It is preferably extruded with excess size and shrunk<br>
onto the filament through cooling to thereby particularly<br>
protect temperature sensitive media. Liquid components can<br>
not evaporate and temperature reactant components do not<br>
decompose. If a jacket made from a plastic material<br>
permitting diffusion of the medium is applied, it may<br>
optionally be covered in parts by a diffusion-tight material<br>
to control diffusion locally and/or the diffusion rate.<br>
If the jacket is made from transparent plastic, medium<br>
consumption can be visually monitored, e.g. through<br>
corresponding coloration of the medium. The type of media may<br>
thereby also be observed.<br>
In addition or instead of displaying the medium and/or its<br>
consumption it is possible to provide an effectivity display<br>
for the bristle function to guarantee that the bristle is<br>
used only as long as it has the properties required for its<br>
intended use. The bristle may also be technically designed<br>
such that it is used only as long as it is effective, by<br>
applying a jacket to the filaments which is made from a<br>
thermoplastic material comprising filling agents which<br>
determine its wear factor, wherein the plastic and the added<br>
filling agents are adjusted to the admissible degree of wear<br>
of the bristle during appropriate use. This method can be<br>
used to provide any type of bristle, optionally consisting of<br>
only a core and a jacket, with an effectivity display.<br>
Filling agents which determine the wear factor can, in<br>
particular, be solids which reduce the intermolecular bonding<br>
in the polymer of the jacket and control the wear factor<br>
through their type, size and amount. The solids of an<br>
application bristle can be selected such that they<br>
simultaneously fulfil a function during application, e.g.<br>
calcium carbonate or chloride as mineral agents in tooth<br>
brushes. The addition of waxes, in particular ionomer wax,<br>
has also proved favorable since they are distributed more<br>
uniformly in the polymer matrix and thus provide a uniform<br>
wear factor. The sliding behavior of the bristle is also<br>
improved. This also permits fine adjustment of an effectivity<br>
display.<br>
In accordance with a further method variant, for application,<br>
different media having different functions may be disposed in<br>
layers or with localized separation and can be discharged at<br>
separate locations. In the same fashion, it is possible to<br>
locally separate components of an agent, having an affinity<br>
to one another, which should be effective only at the<br>
location of use. An example thereof is the desired formation<br>
or regeneration of calcium fluoride layers on teeth which can<br>
be effected in ionising media with Ca(+) and F(-) ions which can<br>
be produced from locally separated Ca and F compounds in the<br>
moist atmosphere of the mouth and throat area.<br>
The media or active components can also be separately<br>
disposed through layered accommodation in the recesses and<br>
combined only when dispensed. The diffusion rate of the media<br>
or active components can be controlled through the formation<br>
of layers.<br>
Furthermore, active components and/or filling agents can be<br>
accommodated in the core or in the jacket or in both.<br>
Finally, the core may be extruded as a monofilament or<br>
multifilament. The core and/or jacket may optionally be<br>
foamed during extrusion or afterwards.<br>
The invention finally concerns a bristle which is obtained<br>
from the filament produced in accordance with the invention<br>
through cutting to the desired length and a brush having a<br>
bristle support for mounting bristles of the above-mentioned<br>
type thereby forming a bristle field or part thereof.<br>
In some applications, it is recommended to close the bristles<br>
at least at their useful end e.g. using thermal methods such<br>
as welding, friction welding, laser welding or the like.<br>

Fig. 1 shows, in illustrations a) through f), different<br>
method steps of producing a filament from which bristles are<br>
obtained by cutting to a desired length. The filament 1 is<br>
extruded in a conventional fashion from a plastic melt in the<br>
form of a core 2, which substantially determines the<br>
mechanical properties of the bristle. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the core 2 consists of a solid center 3 comprising<br>
recesses 4 starting at that location and opening towards the<br>
outside, which are obtained in this embodiment through a<br>
crossed profile of the extruded core (Fig. la). The filament<br>
is subsequently drawn in a conventional fashion (Fig. 1b) to<br>
obtain a longitudinal molecular orientation. The cross-<br>
section is correspondingly reduced through stretching during<br>
drawing of the core. Subsequently, the core 2 is preferably<br>
thermally stabilized (Fig. 1c).<br>
The filament 1 with recesses 4, extruded and pre-treated in<br>
this fashion, is subsequently filled with the medium 6. The<br>
filament 1 is drawn through a channel (indicated in Fig. 1d<br>
with a circular line 5) which optionally narrows like a<br>
nozzle from a larger cross-section to the cross-section of<br>
the core 2 and into which the medium is constantly supplied<br>
such that the medium 6 is accommodated within the recesses 4<br>
of the filament 1. The medium 6 may also be supplied under<br>
pressure, as shown in Fig. 1e which indicates a larger<br>
density of the medium 6. In the embodiment shown whose<br>
depressions have a very open cross-section, it is recommended<br>
to dispose a covering layer 7 onto the filament filled with<br>
the medium, which is formed like a film and which quickly<br>
wears during use of the bristle to discharge the medium 6.<br>
This covering layer 7 may also be a thin-walled jacket which<br>
consists of a diffusion-permitting polymer to allow either<br>
diffusion of the medium 6 at the location of use of the<br>
bristle or to achieve a required permeability only in<br>
connection with media at the location of use, e.g. saliva,<br>
water or the like. The jacket 7 is preferably extruded onto<br>
the previously filled filament 1 having a larger size than<br>
the core 2 and subsequently shrunk onto the core through<br>
cooling.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the section of a bristle 8 obtained from cutting<br>
a filament produced in accordance with Fig. 1. The bristle 8<br>
thereby consists of a core 2 comprising the medium 6 in the<br>
recesses and the jacket 7.<br>
Fig. 3 schematically shows a section of a brush 62, e.g. in<br>
the region of a tooth brush head, comprising a bristle<br>
support 9 to which the bristles 8 are mounted. During use of<br>
the tooth brush, pressure and bending forces act on the<br>
bristle 8 leading to the schematically shown temporary<br>
deformation of the bristle 8. Due to these forces, the medium<br>
6 is discharged at the free end of the bristle as indicated<br>
with directional markers. At the same time, if the medium has<br>
the corresponding composition, it diffuses through the walls<br>
of the jacket, optionally with the cooperation of media<br>
present at the location of use, e.g. saliva, water, tooth<br>
care means or the like. This is shown in Fig. 4 in an<br>
enlarged scale.<br>
Fig. 5 through 10 show cross-sections of filaments 1 which do<br>
not require separate coating or a jacket, depending on the<br>
consistency of the medium. Fig. 5 shows a filament which is<br>
extruded in the shape of a substantially circular core 2<br>
having a solid center 3. During extrusion, recesses in the<br>
form of capillary gaps 10 are formed, which are disposed<br>
regularly and radially in the embodiment shown. The capillary<br>
gaps 10 are filled with the medium in a manner described with<br>
reference to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a similar embodiment wherein the capillary gaps<br>
10 are additionally provided with a profile 11 in the<br>
extrusion direction, thereby achieving an improved retaining<br>
capacity for the medium.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 7, the filament 1 also consists of<br>
a solid core 2 and an external core part 12 which may be made<br>
from a different plastic material than the core 2. The core 2<br>
is e.g. formed of a polymer providing the subsequent bristle<br>
with the required mechanical properties, while the core part<br>
12 may consist of another polymer having properties suitable<br>
for use. The filament 1 has channel-like recesses 13 parallel<br>
to the axis of the core 2 which extend via gap-like openings<br>
14 at the circumference of the filament 1. Fig. 8 again shows<br>
a filament 1 in the shape of an extruded core 2 which only<br>
has a few uniformly distributed channels 15 with gap-like<br>
openings 16 proximate to the circumference.<br>
In the embodiment in accordance with Fig.. 9, the filament 1<br>
is again extruded as core 2 having a solid center 3 from<br>
which a plurality of capillary gaps 17 extend to the outside,<br>
like shovels. The capillary gaps 17 are almost closed at the<br>
circumference 18 of the filament 1. The bridges 20, limiting<br>
the capillary gaps 17 in a shovel-like manner, can be<br>
elastically deformed to facilitate filling of the capillary<br>
gaps 17 in that the filament is turned opposite to the<br>
curvature of the shovel to open the gaps. After filling, the.<br>
excessive medium is pressed out through turning in the<br>
opposite direction or by passing through a corresponding<br>
covering cross-section such that the capillary gaps 17 are<br>
almost closed at the circumference of the filament 1 or in<br>
the subsequent bristle. When brushes equipped with such<br>
bristles are used, the pressure forces effect deformation of<br>
the bristle such that the medium is discharged about the<br>
circumference.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a filament 1 having a rectangular cross-section<br>
into which axially parallel channels 21 are formed which open<br>
at the circumference of the filament 1 via narrow gap-like<br>
openings 22.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a filament 1 having sector-shaped recesses 23<br>
and a central core 3 which is penetrated by the transverse<br>
channels 24. The sector-shaped recesses 2 3 and the transverse<br>
channels 24 are filled with the medium. This filament 1 is<br>
preferably coated with a film or provided with an extruded<br>
jacket, as described with reference to Fig. 1 through 4.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a filament 1 in the shape of a coiled core 2,<br>
wherein the recesses 63 extend like screws. This embodiment<br>
of the filament 1 can also be easily filled with the medium,<br>
and a jacket is advantageously subsequently extruded thereon.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a filament 1 in the shape of a wavy core 2,<br>
wherein the recesses 64 are formed by wave troughs. Fig. 14<br>
shows a filament 1 in the shape of a core 2 comprising<br>
annular recesses 65. In both embodiments, a jacket is<br>
extruded, preferably after filling of the filament 1.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a filament 1 having an extruded core 2 of<br>
rectangular cross-section which is drawn e.g. through an<br>
annular channel, wherein the medium 6 accumulates at the side<br>
surfaces of the rectangular core 2. A jacket 7 is then<br>
extruded and optionally fixed through cooling and shrinking.<br>
Fig. 17 represents a core 2 with uniformly distributed<br>
depressions 26 which are filled with the medium 6 in the same<br>
fashion as described above. A jacket 7 is then once more<br>
extruded onto the core 2 having the medium 6. The embodiment<br>
in accordance with Fig. 18 differs from the one shown in Fig.<br>
17 only by the shape and number of depressions 26.<br>
The filament of the embodiment in accordance with Fig. 19<br>
also has the shape of a core 2 having a cross-shaped cross-<br>
section thereby forming recesses 27 which are open to the<br>
outside and filled with the medium. The core 2 has bead-like<br>
enlargements 29 at the free ends of its arms 28. After<br>
filling of the recesses 27 of the core 2, a jacket 30 is<br>
extruded to surround the bead-like enlargements thereby<br>
forming a kind of positive connection. The embodiment in<br>
accordance with Fig. 20 differs in that the arms 28 of the<br>
core 2 extend straight and that the jacket 31 is extruded and<br>
shrunk after filling of the recesses formed between the arms<br>
28.<br>
Fig. 21 shows a filament 1 having the shape of a core 2,<br>
wherein different embodiments of recesses are indicated. They<br>
may be groove-like, straight depressions 32 or groove-like<br>
curved depressions 33 or individual punched depressions 34.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 23, the filament 1 has a core 2<br>
comprising recesses in the shape of equidistantly disposed<br>
slots 35 which extend transverse to the filament axis and are<br>
formed e.g. after extrusion.<br>
Fig. 24 shows a filament 1 whose core 2 consists of a<br>
plurality of parallel monofilaments 36 wherein the recesses<br>
are formed by the gaps 37 between the monofilaments 36. After<br>
filling the gaps and optionally corresponding sizing of the<br>
monofilament strand, a jacket 38 is extruded.<br>
Fig. 24 shows the jacket 3 8 partially broken away. It is<br>
provided with filling agents 65 which determine the wear<br>
behavior of the plastic and thereby the wear of the jacket.<br>
Fig. 25 shows a filament 1 having the shape of a core 2 which<br>
is provided with one or more axially parallel channels 39<br>
(similar to the embodiment of Fig. 7) which extend to the<br>
outside via gap-like openings 40. It is possible to<br>
additionally provide spaced apart openings 41 having a<br>
somewhat larger cross-section.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 26 shows a filament 1 also having the<br>
shape of an extruded core 2 with recesses 42 disposed at the<br>
circumference which are all covered by a subsequently<br>
disposed layer 43 which either releases the medium in the<br>
recesses 42 due to wear during use or has a permeability<br>
which permits slow diffusion of the media, optionally with<br>
cooperation of the media at the location of use.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 27, the same filament as in Fig. 2 6<br>
comprising a core 2 with recesses, is covered by a jacket 44<br>
of a diffusion-permitting polymer which has e.g. the<br>
properties desired for the surface of the bristle. Additional<br>
partial coatings 45 in the region of the recesses 42 control<br>
the diffusion density and thereby discharge of the media.<br>
Fig. 28 shows a filament 1 with a core having a star-shaped<br>
cross-section, wherein the recesses 46 are formed between the<br>
prongs of the star, and onto which a jacket 47 is also<br>
extruded. The jacket 47 is additionally wrapped with a<br>
plastic or textile fiber.<br>
In the embodiment in accordance with Fig. 29, the filament i<br>
consists of a core 2 similar to the embodiment in accordance<br>
with Fig. 11, having sector-shaped recesses 23 and an<br>
extruded jacket 49 which is provided with a perforation 50 to<br>
permit controlled release of the medium and which also<br>
provides the surface of the finished bristle with a structure<br>
which increases the effect of the bristle.<br>
Fig. 30 shows a filament 1 having a cross-shaped core 2 and a<br>
jacket 7. Different media 51, 52 and 53 are accommodated in<br>
the -recesses 4 between the core 2 and the jacket 7 which are<br>
simultaneously released and either have different effects or<br>
consist of components which become effective only at the<br>
location of use. Alternatively, differing media can also be<br>
disposed in a recess 4, in a layered fashion.<br>
The filament 1 in accordance with Fig. 31 also consists of a<br>
core 2 which has irregularly disposed recesses 54, 55 and 56<br>
and which is surrounded by a jacket 7. These recesses can<br>
also accommodate different media, in dependence on their size<br>
and shape.<br>
Fig. 32 shows a section of a bristle 8 with similar<br>
construction to the one according to Fig. 2, i.e. having a<br>
core 2 comprising a medium 6 located in its recesses and a<br>
jacket 7. The bristle 8 is closed at its useful end 57 e.g.<br>
by corresponding thermal formation of the jacket 8.<br>
Fig. 33 and 34 show an embodiment of a bristle 8 having an<br>
open end 58 in the initial state (Fig. 33) and after a<br>
certain period of use (Fig. 34) during which the jacket 8 is<br>
worn off and the medium has been released. This makes the<br>
mechanical wear and release of the medium visible.<br>
Fig. 35 through 3 8 show another variant for indicating the<br>
media consumption and/or wear of the bristle. Towards this<br>
end, the core 2 optionally comprises several recesses having<br>
the shape of continuous grooves or the like which are<br>
disposed at a separation from one another and in which an<br>
indicating medium 59 is accommodated. During use, the wear of<br>
the jacket 7 starts in the region of the end 58 of the<br>
bristle 8 and only the core 2 remains. The markings 59<br>
disappear successively such that the user is optically<br>
informed of the discharge of the medium or wear of the<br>
bristle.<br>
Fig. 39 finally shows a bristle 8 whose end 59 forms a more<br>
or less regular tip 60 during regular wear. Also in this<br>
case, the core 2 has an annular groove 61 which may<br>
optionally be filled with an indicating medium such that when<br>
same has disappeared, termination of the (optimum) period of<br>
use is signalized.<br>
