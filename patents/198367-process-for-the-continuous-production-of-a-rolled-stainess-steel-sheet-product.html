The invention relates to a process for continuously producing on a production line a rolled stainless steel sheet strip having an improved surface state.     f ^ ». f v^<br>
Various processes are knovm for producing a stainless steel sheet strip from a hot rolled sheet strip, which processes have for purpose to obtain a sheet having an       ' improved surface state characterized, for example, by a roughness Ra lower than 0.25 micrometre.<br>
A process is known for producing a stainless steel sheet strip comprising operations for annealing the hot rolled sheet strip, and pickling said strip, said operations being carried out on a first production line. On a second line, the pickled sheet strip is subjected to a cold rolling operation on a reversing mill, the rolling operation being effected in five passes, and generally in seven or more passes, with a reduction which may vary between 50 and 80 %. Cold rolled in this way, the sheet strip is then put into a coil and conveyed on a line for undergoing an annealing followed by a pickling. Lastly, the pickled sheet strip is subjected to a cold rolling operation of the "skin pass" type which may be followed by a levelling and a shearing operation.<br>
The drawback of this process is due in particular to the large number of plants in which the hot rolled strip of<br><br>
sheet must be treated in succession with consequently the costs of the treatment, the maintenance and the personnel, many intermediate handlings with risks of damage to the sheet strip, losses of metal due to rejection, and treatment durations generally longer than a week and even two weeks or more due to the waiting periods before each of the plants, which waiting periods require corresponding stocks, stocking areas and stocking costs.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a continuous production of a stainless steel sheet strip having on the surface given characteristics of roughness and homogeneity of appearance, the sheet strip being obtained on a single production line, the production process ensuring a considerable reduction in the number of passes in the cold rolling operation and permitting carrying out economically all of the operations required to obtain a sheet strip having a predefined surface Quality.<br><br>

the sheet strip, after cold rolling and final annealing, is subjected to a cold rolling of the "skin pass" type, the cold rolling producing an elongation of the strip of between 0.5 and 2 %,<br>
the sheet strip is, after the final pickling and the rolling of the "skin pass" type, further subjected to a levelling,<br>

The following description and the acconpanying drawings, which are given merely by way of non-limitative examples, will explain the invention.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagram representing in a cold rolling operation the evolution of the surface state of a sheet strip as concerns roughness, as a function of the number of passes and of the reduction produced by the cold rolling.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a curve of the rolling forces as a function of the reduction of the cold rolling for two qualities of rolling oil employed.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of the rolling line according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another block diagram of the rolling line according to the invention.<br>
The invention relates to a process for the continuous production, on a production line, of a rolled stainless steel sheet strip having an improved surface state 2B,<br><br>
characterized by a roughness Ra lower than 0.25 micrometre, and even lower than 0.15 micrometre in the direction of the length and in the direction of the width, the process producing no change in the apparent colour, no halo and no trace of oxide.<br>
According to the process of the invention, a hot rolled sheet strip is subjected, first of all, to a stretcher levelling. The stretcher levelling has for purpose to cause, by the stretching which produces a residue elongation of 1 to 5 % of the sheet strip, a cracking of the layer of oxide on said strip. The stretcher levelling brings about, at this stage of the process, an improvement in the flatness of the sheet strip which has an influence on the following operations, such as the shot blasting. After the stretcher levelling operation, the sheet strip is subjected to a pickling which ensures an improved surface state of the sheet strip as compared with a conventional method for producing a sheet strip, as described in the prior art referred to hereinbefore.<br>
In Fig. 1, the curves A and B provide a diagram representing, in a cold rolling operation, the evolution of the surface state of a sheet strip as concerns roughness, as a function of the number of passes and the reduction in thickness. The evolution of the surface state in the conventional process is represented by the curve A and that of the invention by the cuirve B.<br><br>
As shown on the curves A and B of Fig. 1, the variation in the roughness of a sheet strip decreases as a function, on one hand, of the reduction of the strip in the course of the cold rolling and, on the other hand, of the number of passes in the cold rolling. The number of passes P is represented on the curves A and B of Fig. 1 by a number within a circle.<br>
The conventional process, in which the sheet strip had been subjected, before the cold rolling, to an annealing followed by a shot blasting and a pickling, permits obtaining a sheet strip having a roughness Rt of 25 to 40 micrometres and an Ra of 2.5 to 4 micrometres. In the process according to the invention, the strip has, before cold rolling, a roughness Rt of 10 to 20 micrometres and an Ra of 1 to 2 micrometres. The strip is moreover completely devoid of oxide.<br>
Preferably, and for the purpose of perfecting the surface state of the stretcher levelled sheet strip, the sheet strip is subjected to an abrasion, for example an abrasive brushing, the brushing being carried out before, after, or during the primary pickling operation.<br>
Also for perfecting the surface state of the sheet strip before the cold rolling operation and the pickling, the sheet strip may be subjected to a shot blasting operation which facilitates the removal of the scale without however disturbing in an excessive manner the surface of the sheet.  indeed, the hot rolled sheet strip<br><br>
which has not been annealed has high mechanical characteristics which, when associated with mild shot blasting conditions, permit a shot blasting without harmful disturbance of the surface of the sheet strip.<br>
While it has been acknowledged that the surface state of a sheet strip was in particular improved when the sheet strip is subjected to a large number of passes in the cold rolling operation, the Applicant has discovered that the quality of the surface state of the sheet strip as concerns roughness is due in a large part to the quality of the surface state of the sheet strip before the cold rolling operation. The cold rolling, notwithstanding a large number of passes, removes only very progressively the roughness which appeared in the course of the treatment of the sheet strip before the cold rolling.<br>
According to the invention, the associated stretcher levelling and pickling operations have for purpose to ensure on the surface of the sheet strip a state of roughness which is such that it permits considerably reducing the number of passes in the cold rolling operation. This is shown by the curve B in Fig. 1. According to the invention, the reduction in the number of passes in the cold rolling imposes rolling conditions which ensure a reduction in the roughness of the sheet strip.<br>
The total reduction in the thickness of the sheet strip is optimized to avoid exceeding a rolling force of 800 tons per metre of width exerted on the rolls of the<br><br>
rolling mills. Beyond this limit, there is formed a thick and rough transfer layer on the working rolls which print onto the rolled sheet strip and impart thereto a high roughness corresponding to an Ra of about 1 micrometre.<br>
The diameter of the rolling mill rolls is less than 180 mm, and preferably less than 150 mm, to permit high reductions in the thickness of the strip with rolling forces lower than 800 tons per metre of width.<br>
Such rolls ensure an improvement in the roughness in the course of the cold rolling. The rolls of the last stand must be polished so as to have very low roughness, preferably lower than 0.1 micrometre.<br>
In order to reach reductions in thickness of the sheet strip of less than 60 %, it is preferable to en^loy paraffinic rolling oils containing one or more friction reducing additives, the additives being preferably one or more esters of which the total concentration in the oil is higher than or equal to 10 %. The rolling oils employed permit achieving the aformentioned reductions in a number of passes which is still further reduced, for example two passes, without increasing the rolling forces. For example, the use of a paraffinic oil containing at least 10 % ester, permits, for a given rolling force, a reduction in the thickness of the sheet strip of 35 % as compared with the reduction of 25 % obtained with a conventional oil containing only 1 % ester.<br>
Fig. 2 shows two curves A and B corresponding to the<br><br>
allowed rolling forces as a function of the different rolling reductions for two ester concentrations of a rolling oil.<br>
In order to perfect the surface state of the stretcher levelled hot rolled sheet strip, said strip is subjected to a brushing which may be abrasive, the brushing being carried out before, after or during the chemical pickling operation.<br>
For the same purpose, the stretcher levelled hot rolled sheet strip may be, before pickling and/or brushing, subjected to a shot blasting which facillitates the separation of the scale.<br>
The sheet strip produced by the process according to the invention has a surface quality corresponding to a roughness Ra which is lower than 0.25 micrometre and may reach a roughness Ra lower than 0.15 micrometre.<br>
The invention also relates, as shown in Fig. 3, to a production line 1 for carrying out the process, this production line comprising in association a stretcher leveller 2 and a primary pickling station 3 ensuring a stoppage of the pickling operation on the line simultaneously with the stoppage of the cold rolling device.<br>
Further, a very large reduction in the duration of the pickling treatment of the steel is imposed to avoid an accumulation or gathering of the strip between the various devices of the line.  Such a continuous production line has<br><br>
the advantage of reducing the intermediate handling and the stocking.<br>
In the field of the cold rolling of stainless steel sheet strips, the treatment of the working rolls of the rolling mill must impart to said rolls a sufficient wear resistance to maintain the quality of their surface during the rolling of at least one coiled strip of 30 tons. The rolls employed are of high-speed steel, supercarburized with vanadium or sintered, and must be changed practically for each rolled coil. Consequently, the line must be stopped in a regular manner for each changing of the working rolls. The use of a pickling bath before the cold rolling device presents the problem of the frequent stoppages of the mill and of the control of the durations of the passage of the strip in the pickling bath. Indeed, the different stoppages of the sheet strip on a single production line requires an arrangement ensuring a reserve supply of strip by means of strip accumulators placed between the various stations and devices.<br>
According to the invention, the primary pickling station 3 is followed by a cold rolling device 4. The pickling station 3 comprises a tank containing an acid bath provided with a device for extracting the immersed sheet strip.<br>
Preferably, and for ensuring the frequent stoppages on the line without deteriorating the strip by an uncontrolled chemical attack, the pickling station 3 is of the spraying<br><br>
type. The station pickling by spraying permits an instantaneous stoppage of the pickling by the stoppage of the spraying simultaneously with the stoppage of the mill.<br>
In another embodiment, the primary pickling station 3 may be an eletrolytic pickling station comprising a tank for example of neutral salt, the stoppage of the station being achieved by stopping the electric power supply of the electrolytic tank.<br>
The pickling station 3, provided with means for stopping the pickling, permits reducing in volume or eliminating the strip accumulator 13 usually placed between the pickling station 3 and the cold rolling device 4.<br>
The line 1 comprises, following on the non-reversing cold rolling device 4 having at the most three stands 5, a device 6 for annealing the cold rolled strip, a final pickling station 7, and a cold rolling device of the "skin pass" type 8.<br>
The line 1 according to the invention may further comprise, placed after the stretcher levelling device, as shown in Fig. 4, a shot blasting station 9 and/or brushing means 10 which may be abrasive, contributing to the refining of the quality of the surface of the sheet strip before cold rolling so as to obtain an improved surface state of the sheet strip after said cold rolling, the number of passes of which is reduced..<br>
The production line may further comprise, following on the cold rolling device of the "skin pass" type,  a<br><br>
stretcher leveller device 11 associated with a shearing device 12. A second shearing device may be placed after the stretcher leveller 2.<br>
In one embodiment, a hot rolled austenitic steel sheet strip having a thickness of 2 mm is subjected to a stretcher levelling which produces a residual elongation of 3.5 %.<br>
The sheet strip is then pickled in two baths of sulphuric acid . At this stage of the process, the sheet strip has a roughness of lower than 1.5 micrometre.<br>
The sheet strip is then subjected to a cold rolling in three passes on a Sendzimir cold rolling train of type ZHi. The sheet strip is cold rolled with a reduction of 50 %. The sheet strip is annealed and then pickled. It then has, after these short cold rolling, annealing and pickling operations, a roughness Ra lower than 0.25 micrometre. The sheet strip is subjected, in one pass, to a cold rolling of the "skin pass" type producing an elongation of 0.8 %. The sheet strip then has a roughness Ra lower than 0.1 micrometre.<br>
In another embodiment, a hot rolled ferritic steel sheet strip stabilized with titanium and having a thickness of 3 mm is subjected to a stretcher levelling producing a residual elongation of 4 %.<br>
The sheet strip is then pickled in an H2SO4 acid bath, then in an HNO3 acid bath. At this stage of the process the sheet strip has a roughness Ra lower than 2 micrometres.<br><br>
The sheet strip is then subjected to a cold rolling in two passes with a reduction of 50 % on Sendzimir mills of type ZHi, annealed and pickled, It has, after the short cold rolling, annealing and pickling operations, a roughness Ra lower than 0.25 micrometre. The sheet strip is then subjected to a cold rolling operation in one pass of the "skin pass" type producing an elongation of the strip of 0.8 %. The sheet strip then has a roughness lower than 0.15 micrometre.<br>
On this production line, there is the problem of the pickling and in particular of a pickling within an imposed short period of time, in order to avoid imperatively an accumulation of the treated strip between the various devices arranged in succession on the continuous strip producing line.<br>
In another emodiment, the stainless steel sheet strip is pickled by an aqueous pickling solution containing hydrochloric acid and ferric and ferrous pickling ions in solutin, for a purpose of maintaining a constant pickling power of the aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and maintaining the concentration of Fe^* ions, by reoxidation of the Fe2+ ions generated in the course of the pickling, the REDOX potential being maintained at a value between 0 and 800 mV, this potential being measured between a platinum electrode and a reference Ag/AgCi electrode placed in the solution.<br>
The pickling operations before rolling in a continuous<br><br>
line ensure an optimum quality of the surface state of the strip. The effectiveness of the pickling may permit, depending on the quality of the sheet strip, the elimination of the mechanical treatments of the stretcher levelling type, shot blasting, brushing, thereby considerably reducing the steel sheet strip production line.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the reduction in the number of passes in the cold rolling permits providing a continuous line having a reduced cold rolling device, thereby reducing the investment cost for obtaining a sheet of quality and also greatly reducing the line maintenance and personnel costs. The continuous line thus results in a very considerable reduction in the duration of the treatment, and therefore in the stocks of semi-finished products, and the elimination of intermediate handlings which are the cause of defects and loss of metal.<br><br><br>
