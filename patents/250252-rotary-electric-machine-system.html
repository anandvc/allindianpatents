				<td>[Technical Field] [0001]<br>
This invention relates to a rotary electric machine system used for such an application as a vehicle-carried system, and particularly to a rotary electric machine system suitable for use both as a starter and a generator. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
As a principal rotary electric machine for a vehicle, a starter for starting an engine and a generator for generating power by engine rotation are available. Further, also an ACG starter capable of being used as both of a starter and a generator has been developed, and reduction of the cost and weight and effective utilization of the installation space are achieved. [0003]<br>
In such an ACG starter, required rotational driving force is set based on the size of an applied engine. On the other hand, a required power generation capacity is set based on a vehicle-carried load and a battery capacity. Therefore, it sometimes occurs that the<br>
rotational driving force and the power generation capacity do not coincide with each other.  Particularly, it sometimes occurs that, in a vehicle on which a large size engine is incorporated, the rotational driving force may be excessively high when compared with the required power generation capacity.  Thus, if power generation is performed in a connection configuration conforming to the rotation driving force, then there is the possibility that a disadvantage of excessive charging into a battery or the; like may occur. [0004]<br>
Therefore, in a starting generator disclosed in Patent; Document 1, relays provided for individual phases which are provided so that, upon starting of an engine, a crankshaft is rotated by four Y wire connection sections but; power generation is performed by one Y wire connection section after starting of the engine are operated to implement both of securing of a motor performance necessary for engine starting and prevention of excessive charging. [0005]<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-83209 [Disclosure- of the Invention]<br><br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0006]<br>
Incidentally, in the starting generator disclosed in Patent Document 1 mentioned above, individual relays correspondinq to at least two phases are required and must have contacts which are independent among the individual relays.  Therefore, the number of parts is great and the configuration is complicated. [0007]<br>
The present invention has been made taking such a subject as described above into consideration, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a rotary electric machine system of a simple and convenient configuration which is changed over such that the driving force when it is used as a motor and the power generation amount when it is used as a generator may individually be appropriate.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems] [0008]<br>
According to the present invention, a rotary electric machine system has a first characteristic that it includes a rotary electric machine having a rotor and a stator, a wire connection section provided on the stator and formed from a plurality of coils provided for<br><br>
each phase and each having one end connected as an inputting and outputting section, a relay configured to short-circuit, and disconnect some of the plurality of coils for the individual phases by opening and closing the coils, and a control section connected to the inputting and outputting sections and an operation section of the relay, and the control section short-circuits contacts of the relay and supplies power to the inputting and outputting section when the rotor is to be rotated, but: disconnects the contacts of the relay and supplies power obtained from the inputting and outputting sections to a predetermined load or a charging section when power generation is to be performed by rotation of the rotor. [0009]<br>
The rotary electric machine system has a second characteristic that the wire connection section has three phases; the relay includes a first switch section and a second switch section; the other end of a predetermined number of the coils of the first phase of the wire connection section is connected to one of contacts of the first switch section and the second switch section; the other end of the predetermined number of the coils of the second phase of the wire connection section is connected<br><br>
to the other contact of the first switch section; and the other end of the predetermined number of the coils of the third phase of the wire connection section is connected to the other contact of the second switch section. [0010]<br>
The rotary electric machine system has a third characteristic that the control section operates the first switch section and the second switch section so as to perform short-circuiting and disconnection actions in synchronism with each other.  The rotary electric machine system has a fourth characteristic that the control section measures voltages at the other ends of the coils connected to the relay and outputs a predetermined alarm signal based on a potential difference. [Effects of the Invention] [0011]<br>
According to the first characteristic of the present invention, when the rotary electric machine is to be used as a motor, magnetic power is generated by all of the coils to obtain high driving force.  Consequently, for example, the crankshaft of a large engine can be rotated to start the engine with certainty.  On the other hand, when the rotary electric machine is to be used as a generator, r:he predetermined number of coils of each<br><br>
phase is disconnected at the other ends thereof by the relay.  Therefore, the coils are not used for power generation and the power generation capacity is suppressed.  Accordingly, excessively high power can be prevented from being supplied to the load or the charging section. [0012]<br>
According to the second characteristic of the present invention, since the first switch section and the second switch section perform opening and closing operations, a switch section of the two contact type having versatility can be used. [00131<br>
According to the third characteristic of the present invention, since synchronism is established, the control procedure can be simplified and made convenient, and changeover between effective and ineffective states of the coils of the wire connection section can be carried out with certainty. [0014J<br>
According to the fourth characteristic of the present invention, the operator can perform a predetermined countermeasure process in response to the a 1 a rrni ng s igna 1.<br><br>

A step floor 30 for receiving the feet of the driver placed thereon is provided at an upper portion of the intermediate frame 20 between the seat 28 and down pipe 18, [0020]<br>
The vehicle 11 includes an engine automatic stopping and starting (stop and go) function for automatically stopping an engine 40 upon stopping and for automatically driving, if such a starting operation that a throttle grip is operated for opening or a starter switch is operated into an on state is performed, a starter motor to re-start the engine. [0021]<br><br>
The engine 40 of the single-cylinder four-cycle type is mounted at a front portion of the swing unit 24. A belt type variable speed transmission 44 is configured so as to extend rearwardly from the engine 40, and the rear wheel RW is supported for rotation on the belt type variable speed transmission 44 by a reduction gear 45 provided at a rear portion of the belt type variable speed transmission 44 through a centrifugal clutch.  A rear suspension 25 is interposed between an upper end of the reduction gear 45 and an upper curved portion of the rear frame 22.  A carburetor connected to an intake pipe extending from the engine 40 and an air cleaner connected to the carburetor are disposed at a front portion of the swing unit 24. [0022]<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional view showing the swing unit 24 taken along the crankshaft 52, and FIG. 3 is an enlarged partial sectional top plan view of the swing unit 24.  In FIGS. 2 and 3, like elements to those described hereinabove are denoted by same or like reference characters. [0023]<br>
The swing unit 24 is connected and supported for rocking motion to a hanger bracket 19a through a<br><br>
predetermined link member. The swing unit 24 is covered with a crankcase 54 formed by integrating left and right crankcases 54L and 54R, and the crankshaft 52 is supported for rotation by a bearing 56 fixed to the right crankcase 54R.

The relay 162 includes the operation section 162a<br><br>
which is excited by energization and the switch section 162b whose contacts are opened or closed by the operation section 162a.  The switching section 162b has the contacts 161a, 161b and 161c, which are short-circuited to each other when the operation section 162a is excited by energization but are disconnected from each other when the operation section 162a is not excited so that they are isolated from each other.  In particular, the relay 162 is of the normally open type. [0042.]<br>
The stator 74 has the wire connection section 160 of the three-phase Y-connection type.  The wire connection section 160 includes three stator coils 163a, 163b and 163c for each of the U, V and W phases, and each of the stator coils 163a, 163b and 163c of each phase is connected at one end thereof as inputting and outputting sections 164U, 164V or 164W.  (The suffices U, V and W indicate corresponding phases.  This similarly applies to the following description.)  The inputting and outputting sections 164U to 164W are connected to the full-wave rectification bridge circuit 102. [0043]<br>
The stator coils 163b of the phases are connected at the other end thereof to each other and form a first<br><br>
neutral point 01.  The stator coils 163a and 163c of the U phase are connected at the other end thereof to each other to form the neutral point forming line 165U and connected to the contact 161a of the relay 162.  The stator coils I63a and 163c of the V phase are connected at the other end thereof to each other to form the neutral point forming line 165V and connected to the contact 161b of the relay 162.  The stator coils 163a and 163c of the W phase are connected at the other end thereof to each other to form the neutral point forming line 165W and connected to the contact 161c of the relay 16 2 . [0044]<br>
Further, the neutral point forming lines 165U to 165W are connected also to the voltage monitoring section 116.  The voltage monitoring section 116 measures the voltages of the neutreil point forming lines 165U to 165W and outputs a predetermined alarm signal when the relay 162 is off and the AC potential difference becomes lower than a predetermined threshold value (for example, approximately 5 V). [0045]<br>
Now, action of the rotary electric machine system 10 of the vehicle 11 having the configuration described<br><br>
above is described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
[0046]<br>
First; at: step SI, when the vehicle 11 is to be driven, the driver would turn on the main switch 167 to start the ECU 100.  In this initial state, the relay control section 118 keeps the relay 162 in a non-excited state, and the contacts of the contact 161b are open.<br>
[0047J<br>
At step 32, the driver would operate the starter switch 108 to start the engine 40.  At this time, the relay control section 118 detects a signal in response to the operation of the starter switch 108 to excite the operation section 162a of the relay 162 to short-circuit the contacts of the switch section 162b.  Consequently, the other ends of the stator coils 163a and 163b of the individual phases are connected to each other thereby to form a neutral point of the Y connection.  In the following description, the neutral point is identified as second neutral point 02 from the first neutral point Ol.<br>
[0048]<br>
Meanwhile, the driver 102a of the full-wave rectification bridge circuit 102 receives power from the starter relay 144 which operates in response to the operation of the starter switch 108 and controls the<br><br>
semiconductor switching devices 102b between open and closed states to reform the power into and supplies AC power to the wire connection section 160.  Consequently, the ACG starter 70 can act as a starter motor to rotate the crankshaft 52. [0049]<br>
At this time, since the second neutral point 02 is formed, the stator coils 163a to 163c of the U to W phases are placed into a configuration wherein they are connected substantially in parallel to each other. Consequently, torque approximately equal to three times that generated by a Y connection in a state wherein the stator coils 163b are connected to each other only at the first neutral point Ol can be generated.  Since the ACG starter 70 can generate high torque in this manner, the crankshaft 52 can be rotated directly without intervention of 'a reduction gear. [0050]<br>
As the crankshaft 52 rotates, a spark is generated from the ignition plug 119 at a predetermined ignition timing based on a signal of the pulser sensor 90. Vaporized fuel in the combustion chamber is expanded by ignition and drives the crankshaft 52 through the connecting rod to start the engine 40.<br><br>
[0051]<br>
At step S3, the driver would recognize it from engine sound, the tachometer and so forth that the engine 40 is started, and open the starter switch 108.  The relay control section 118 detects that the starter switch 108 is opened, and places the operation section 162a of the relay 162 into a non-exited state to open the switch section 162b,  Consequently, the second neutral point O2 disappears and the stator coils 163a and 163c are deenergized while the first neutral point Ol remains and the stator coils 163b effectively keep the Y connection. It is to be noted that the opening and closing timings of the relay 162 need not necessarily be synchronized with the starter switch 108 only if they are timed with the starting of the engine 40, and for example, the relay 162 may be opened when it is detected by suitable means that the engine 40 is placed into a full explosion state.<br>
[0052]<br>
Since the relay 162 is of the normal open type and is excited basically only when the engine 40 is started, the period of time within which the relay 162 is energized with exciting current is short, and the power consumed by the relay 162 is very low.<br>
[0053]<br><br>
The driver 102a of the full-wave rectification bridge circuit 102 detects that the starter switch 108 is opened, and controls the semiconductor switching devices 102b to change over the energization direction of current so that alternating power generated by the stator coils 163b by rotation of the crankshaft 52 and the outer rotor 72 is converted into DC power.  The DC power is supplied to a load and is charged into the battery 97 through the main switch 167 and the fuse 166. [0054]<br>
In this manner, upon power generation by the ACG starter 70 (in short, except when the engine 40 is started), since the stator coils 163a and 163c of the wire connection section 160 are ineffective and only the stator coils 163b generate power, the power generation amount is suppressed and the battery 97 is not overcharged, [0055]<br>
At step S4, the voltage monitoring section 116 starts its action under the condition that the engine 40 is started to open the relay 162.  The voltage monitoring section 116 measures AC voltages (for example, effective values or maximum values) generated in the neutral point forming lines 165U to 165W and outputs an alarm signal<br><br>
when ":he potential difference between the terminals becomes lower than a predetermined threshold value.  Based on the output of the alarm signal, the alarm indicator 153 is lit and the alarm buzzer 142 is driven to emit sound to draw attention of the driver.<br>
[00561<br>
Although the switch section 162b is controlled so that, upon power generation, it is turned off in order to suppress the power generation amount of the wire connection section 160 as described above, even if the operation section 162a is placed into a non-excited state, if the switch section 162b remains short-circuited from an unexpected situation, then the potential differences between the neutral point forming lines 165U, 165V and 165W exhibit zero or a very low value.  Accordingly, by detecting such a state as just described under the action of the voltage monitoring section 116 and outputting an alarm signal, attention of the driver can be drawn.<br>
[0057]<br>
Or, the alarm signal may be supplied to the ignition suppression control section 114 so that the rotational speed N of the engine 40 is restricted stepwise in an interlocking relationship with a predetermined timer.  For example, the ignition<br><br>
suppression control section 114 restricts the rotational speed N to 6,500 rpm until a predetermined period of time elapses after the alarm signal is supplied, arid then restricts the rotational speed N to 4,500 rptn after another predetermined period of time elapses after then. Thereafter, when a further predetermined period of time elapses, the ignition suppression control section 114 stops the engine 40. [0058]<br>
Consequently, the driver can recognize it from a drop of the rotational speed N that some fault occurs, and since sufficient time is available before the engine 40 stops, the driver can perform such a suitable countermeasure process as to stop the vehicle 11 at a suitable place or drive the vehicle 11 to a predetermined maintenance workshop. [0059;<br>
It is to be noced that the relay 162 may be replaced by a relay pair 200 or a relay 210 according to a modification as shown in FIG. 7 or 8. [00601<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the relay pair 200 according to the first modification includes a first relay (first switch section) 202 and a second relay (second switch<br><br>
section) 204.  The first relay 202 and the second relay 204 have the same structure and have a pair of contacts 206a and 2065, a switch section 208 for short-circuiting and disconnecting the contacts 206a and 206b, and an operation section 209 for operating the switch section 208 . [0061]<br>
The contacts 206a of the first relay 202 and the second relay 204 are connected to the neutral point forming line 165U.  The contact 206b of the first relay 202 is connected to the neutral point forming line 165V, and the contact. 206b of the second relay 204 is connected to the neutral point forming line 165W.  Further, the operation sections 209 are connected in parallel to the relay control section 118, and the first relay 202 and the second relay 204 operate in synchronism with each other while the relay pair 200 functions substantially as a single relay and acts similarly to the relay 162 described hereinabove.  The first relay 202 and the second relay 204 may be incorporated in one package. [0062]<br>
Since the switch sections 208 of the first relay 202 and the second relay 204 operate in synchronism with each other, they can be controlled through a single<br><br>
signal line simply and conveniently in that there is no necessity to distinguish a control procedure for each relay..  Further, since the first relay 202 and the second relay 204 operate in synchronism with each other, the energization state of the stator coils 163a and 163c of each phase is changed over simultaneously and with certainty. [0063]<br>
As shown iri FIG. 8, the relay 210 according to the second modification includes two pairs of contacts 212a, 212b and 214a, 214b, a first switch section 216 for short circuiting and disconnecting the contacts 212a and 212b, a second switch section 218 for short-circuiting and disconnecting the contacts 214a and 214b, and a single operation section 220 for causing the first switch section 216 and the second switch section 218 to operate in synchronism with each other.  The operation section 220 is energized and controlled by the relay control section 118 . [0064]<br>
The contacts 212a and 214a are connected to the neutral point forming line 165U.  The contact 212b is connected to the neutral point forming line 165V while the contact 214b is connected to the neutral point<br><br>
forming line 165W.  By such connection, the relay 210 exhibits action similar to that of the relay 162 described hereinabove.<br>
[0065]<br>
Further, the relay 210, first relay 202 and second relay 204 are more universal than the relay 162 described hereinabove and are used widely and besides are less expensive.<br>
[0066]<br>
As described above, with the rotary electric machine; system 10 according to the present embodiment, when the ACG starter 70 is used as a motor, all of the stator coils 163a to 163c generate magnetic power to obtain high driving force, and the crankshaft 52 of the engine 40 can be started with certainty.  On the other hand, when the ACG starter 70 is used as a generator, the other ends of the two stator coils 163a and 163c for each phase are opened by the relay 162, and consequently, the stator coils 163a and 163c are not used for power generation and the power generation capacity is suppressed. Accordingly, excessively high power can be prevented from being supplied to the load or the battery 97.<br>
[0067]<br><br>
Further, since the relay 162 short-circuits and disconnects the place serving as the second neutral point 02 of the wire connection section 160, relays independent of each other for the individual phases are not required but substantially one relay can be used for the relay 162 Therefore, the configuration is simple and convenient.<br>
[0068]<br>
It is to be noted that, while, in the example described hereinabove, the stator coils 163a to 163c are connected to the relay 162 such that the stator coils 163b from among the stator coils 163a to 163c are connected to the first neutral point Ol and the stator coils 163a and 163c form the second neutral point 02, the ratio between the numbers of coils which are to be connected to the first neutral point 01 and the second neutral point 02 may be suitably set depending upon design conditions.<br>
[0069]<br>
Further, while, in the present embodiment described above, a relay is used as a contact opening and closing section for a coil, the contact opening and closing section is not limited to this.<br>
[0070]<br>
The rotary electric system according to the present<br><br>
invention is riot limited to the embodiment described<br>
hereiriabove but can naturally take various configurations<br>
without departing from the subject matter of the present<br>
invention.<br>
