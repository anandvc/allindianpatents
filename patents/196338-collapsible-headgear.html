				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a Collapsible Head Qear which designed to open in operative position and to fold in in-operative position. The said Collapsible Head Qear comprises of a plurality of fan-shaped segments which can be super imposed one on the other. The said seven segments arrangement which made up of high density polyethylene fibre glass are hinged at two points. Each segment has a spherical internal radius to form a normal size of the skull and also includes a spring-loaded plunger mechanism on the sides to achieve the Lock-in position. Two ends of each of the said segments are fixed to each one of the two circular plates. The said circular plates are connected in a super imposed position by means of a pivot. The said spring disposed in a sleeve of pivot comprises of two ends - one end fixed to hold-on member and its other end to an adjustable-member extending into said sleeve, whereby the tension of the said spring can be adjusted. The successive position of the said segments from collapsed position can be obtained by means of aperture portion of said circular plates and a complementary hook member. Thus the Collapsible Head Qear as per the invention prevents the two wheelers from skull injuries and provide safe travel, comfortable and easy to carry.</td>

				<td>BACKGROUND OF THEINVENTION :-<br>
Tremendous increase in two wheelers on the road has resulted in ever growing number of accident often fatal. Of the fatalities  more ate the result of skull injuries which are caused in the absence of crash HeadGears. Ironically the victims though aware of the advantages of wearing The HeadGear are reluctant to use them. The most common reason as the survey painted out, was that the HeadGear is too cumbersome to carry and cannot be left with the two wheeler for the fear of theft.  For this reason the opposition to the law which made wearing HeadGear mandatory was so overwhelming that the Tamil  Nadu Government has to withdraw it<br>
DESCSIPTION OF THE RELATED ARTS;-<br>
According to the US Patent no. 4091470, the collapsibie head indudes two segment helmet and the positioning mechanism by means of a hole and a projection between two segments ie the positioning device in the open position between the segments is by means of ahole and a project between two adjacent segment.  Whereas the positioning mechanism used in the present invention is by interlocking of hook members projected in each of segment such that the upward facing hook member locks with the downward facing hook member of the adjacent segment. In WO 96/21371, the collapsible  helmet includes three arched mexnber to form a elliptical shape in operative position and collapse with each other in inoperatis;^e position wheneas   the   present invention is  for  seven  piece   segments<br><br>
collapsible headgear with positioning means by interlocking of hook member projected in each of segment such that the segment are opened out to form fan pattern in operative position and then collapsed over one another in inoperative position.<br>
The most distinguishing feature of the present invention from the EP 08Q2745 is the capacity of the Helmet to be folded into 1/7th of the <br>
helmet when not in use.  The same se. Ihe same foldable helmet is openable to the full size with all the characteristic required for the purpose both mendatory and desired characteristic.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION :-<br>
lb overcome this apathy and reluctanoe, an alternative has to be introduced. This invention therefore is putting the concept of collapsible or folding HeadGear which will acceptable to all two wheel riders. This will go a long way tn prevent skull injuries.<br>
PRINCIPLE &amp; CONSTRUCTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thexe east seven segments in this collapsible HeadGear.<br>
The profile of the collapsible HeadGear is achieved by the seven segment arrangement hinged at two points.  If a person who uses this wants he can unfold it like a hand fen.    There is provision for letaining the<br><br>
HeadGear shape alter it iÂ« pulled from 7th segment to first segment and locking in position with the spring loaded plunger mechanism on thesides. This plunger mechanism automatically locks in position when unfolded. When collapsed, the pin is pulled on the sides and the segments are free to get slided over each other to get collapsed.<br>
All the seven segments of the collapsible HeadGear will be made of high density polyethylene fibre glass reinformed plastic material to shore hardness 120.  They will be of precision die cast quality. Each segment beats the spherical internal radius to suit the form. of skull. Also the enveloping of the segment are taken care by hook arrarngments. They slide one upon the other and get locked in position. Abo when required they will slip within each other and get collapsed to form a handy baggage.<br>
These segments are smoothly finished for having elegant look and colour. Suitable ribs arrangements wherever necessary will be provided to stand against impact. loads etc. Hardness, impact load test will be carried out on these segments during manufacture,<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :<br>
A collapsible  HeadGear adapter to collapse in in-operative position and to open in an operative comprising:-<br><br>
plurality of fan-shaped segments- adapted to be super imposed one on the other,<br>
two circular plates having an aligned aperture therein, one each fixed to the two ends of the each of the said segments,<br>
a pivot means for connecting the said circular plates in super imposed positioa, thus enabling the said segments to pivot between fold and open position,<br>
wherein the said piwot means comprising a sleeve extending through said aligned apertures in the circular plates, a spring disposed in said sleeve, a hold-on member disposed over said stacked circidar piates, said spring liaviug one end tibexeof fixed to said holdon member, an adjuatable-member extending into said sleeve, said spring having its other end asjustably secured ID said djustable member whereby the tension of the said s pring can be adjusted,<br>
a position means Ibr successively positioning said segments upon opening from collapsed  position, comprising hook member formed about a periphetel portion of the said circular plates and a complementary hock member such that said aperture portion and complementry hook member being so arranged whereby the upturned tip of hok member of one plate engages with the hook member of the next adjacent plate,<br>
a fastening means on the said segments such that each of the said segments is provide with with sets of fastening means, said first fastening means being aperture to restrict circumferential displacement of said segment  relative to one another and said second fastening means being operative to restrict outward displacement of the adjacent outward displacement of the adjacent segments in the open position of the said HeadGear       '<br><br>
whenin the said fastening means compising of an aperture disposed along one edge of the segment and a complementary projection oppositely disposed along the other longitudinal edge of the said segment, whereby the aperture of one segment is adapted to receive a complrmentary projection of the next adjacent segpment in the open position of the said segment and its complementary projection and aperture of said second fasteming means being relatively moveable to one another to and having complementry latching means to provide an interlock therein.<br>
a lock means comprising of a pin and spting loaded mechanism to retain the HeadGeat shape when the seven segments open out in an opeiatiue position and to allow the segtuents to collapse and slide ever one another when in an in-operative position, by a plunger,<br>
wherein the segments ate of high density polyethyleme fibre glass reinforced plastic to shore hardness 120 .and hare a spherical internal radius ganerally suited to fit a skuU.<br>
Interior will be smoothly finished and sponge material lined to avoid injury to the head when warn. protection from craked segment piercing the headhas also been taken care.<br>
Exterior of the collapsible HeadGear will be coveied by water proof polythene coated lesins smoothly fidniaect and fixed in both the sides of the segments, so that when unfolded they form smooth folded cover. Thus when the HeadGear is opened or dosed the interior or exterior cover will not hamper the sliding mechanism of the segment.<br><br>
The HeadGear is packed in a square carton of 275 x 100 mm thick and the same can be carried in any Dick box of any motor bike / scooter, moped etc.<br>
