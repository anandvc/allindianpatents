DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the accompanying di"awings, there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
FIG, 1 shows one embodiment of a display unit of the invention. As shown in FIG. 1, a display unit comprises a liquid crystal display section 111 of TFT (thin-film transistor) type divided into a first display area Ilia and a second display area 111b, a gate driver 113 and a source driver 115 for driving the liquid crystal display section 111, a controller 117 containing memory for supplying serial display data to the source driver 115, a power supply section 120 for supplying power to the gate driver 113, the source driver 115, and the controller 117, a control section 130 into which a display data control section<br><br>
131 for classifying display data to display on the liquid crystal display section Hi and a font generation section 133, one of display data processing sections, are integrated, and a display data processing section 140 for converting the display data classified by the control section 130 into a format fitted for liquid crystal display. The display data may be supplied from the controller 117 containing the memory to the gate driver 113 and the source driver 115, as shown in FIG. 2, depending on the configuration contents. In this case, both display data from the display data processing section A 140 and display data from the display data processing section B 133 are supplied to the controller. Different configuration contents are also possible; as shown in FIG. 3, the controller 117 may control the power supply section 120. In this case, a command specifying the display area to a data signal from the display data processing section can be suppKed to the controller 117. Further, in addition, image processing section may be integrated into the control section 130.<br>
The hquid crystal display section 111, the gate driver 113, the source driver 115, and the controller 117 make up a display section 110. The liquid crystal display section 111 may be a liquid crystal display capable of producing color display, such as a liquid crystal display of TN (twist nematic) type, etc., as well as the TFT type; it may be a liquid crystal display incorporating EL (electroluminescent) or LED (light emitting diode) or a flat-panel type display unit of PDP (plasma display), etc., rather than a liquid crystal display.<br>
The first display area 111a of the liquid crystal display section 111 is an area for displaying a monochrome still image and is statically driven to suppress power consumption. The first display area 111a is selected by the gate driver 113 in the standby mode and displays still images displayed at all times, such as a battery icon, a time icon, an out-of-range icon, a received electric field strength icon, and mail information registered in the terminal if the terminal is a portable telephone. The second display area 11 lb of the hquid crystal display section 111 is an area for displaying color images of about<br><br>
260000 colors and undergoes active matrix drive. The second display area 11 lb is selected together with the first display area 11 la by the gate driver 113 at the conversion time and the operation time (use time) and displays images displayed when required, such as a color pictograph registered in the terminal and an image distributed via a network.<br>
The power supply section 120 supplies power of voltages showTi in the figure to the gate driver 113, the source driver 115, and the controller 117 making up the display section 110, Further, the display data control section 131 supphes a selection signal for selecting the first display area 111a (CS_AREAl) and a selection signal for selecting the first and second display areas 111a and 111b (CS„ALL) to the power supply section 120 as selection signals for selecting the display areas of the liquid crystal display section 111. The selection signal of the display area may be input to the controller for controlling the power supply section (FIG. 2). In this case, a command is sent to the controller 117 with display area control signal as a part of data signal from the second display data processing section (font generation section) 133, and control signal is supplied from the controller 117 to the power supply section 120.<br>
The control section 130 classifies input display data according to the display contents determined by the display data control section 131 contained in the control section 130 and selects the path for displaying a display image on the liquid crystal display section 111. It supplies moving image data, still image data having a large number of gradation steps, and display data requiring a short transfer time to the first display data processing section 140 for converting the data into a synchronous signal fitted for moving image display. The second display data processing section (font generation section) 133 contained in the control section 130 converts a simple moving image, a low-gi-adation still image, and icon data into a data format fitted for small-scaled display (for example, SD:    Serial data) and supphes the serial data (SD)<br><br>
together with chip select (CS) and clock (CLK) to the memory in the controller 117 of the display section 110.<br>
The first display data processing section 140 decodes display data compressed, for example, in MPEG4 and converts the data into synchronous data fitted for moving image display for liquid crystal display in R, G, and B each consisting of six bits; the second display data processing section (font generation section) 133 defines color (display/non-display) of provided font data in two bits capable of representing monochrome and converts the font data into display data. The first display data processing section 140 can also convert input display data from a camera 150 into RGB each of six bits and output the display data via a data transfer path 160 to the display section 110 according to an instruction of the display data control section 131. The first display data processing section 140 converts display data into liquid crystal display data and supphes the data to the gate driver 113 and the source driver 115 forming the parts of the display section 110, for example, as a total of 30 control signals containing six bits of each of R, G, and B. The data from the first display data processing section 140 maybe supplied to the controller 117, as shown in FIG. 2. The display data fiom the first display data processing section 140 can also be retained in the memory in the controller 117 in response to the display state. On the other hand, the second display data processing section 133 converts data into fiquid crystal data for a partial display area, transfers the data in series, and supphes to the controller 117 forming a part of the display section 110, for example, with a total of three control signals.<br>
The operation in the configuration described above will be discussed by taking a portable telephone as an example.<br>
In the configuration, in the standby mode, the partial display area of the first display area 111a of the liquid crystal display section 111 is selected for displaying a monochrome still image and at the conversation time or the operation time (use time), a color image of about 260000 colors is displayed in<br><br>
the full display area consisting of the first display area 111a and the second display area 111b. The display area l11a may be a full screen depending on setting of the display areas. Further, in full screen display, it is also possible to display a monochrome still image only in the display ai"ea 111 depending on the element configuration of the display section.<br>
First, the case of displaying an image in the standby mode will be discussed. The control section 130 activates the selection signal (CS_AEEAl) supphed to the power supply section 120, whereby the gate driver 113 selects the first display area 111a and supplies power thereto. In the case in FIG. 3, a partial display control signal is sent to the controller 117 as a part of a data signal from the second display data processing section (font generation section) 133 and control signal is supplied from the controller 117 to the power supply section 120.<br>
Monochrome still image data output from the control section 130 is retained in the memory in the controller 117 forming a part of the display section 110. The monochrome still image data retained in the memory is controlled by the source driver 115 so that data is sent to the pixels corresponding to the addi-esses of the memory. To display the first display area, the data transfer period from the control section 130 to the display section<br>
110	is delayed (for example, once a second) and the transfer period of data read from the controller from the source driver to the liquid crystal display section<br>
111	(frame frequency) is lowered, whereby it is made possible to drive with low power consumption.<br>
The images displayed in the standby mode are not hmited to the above-mentioned monochrome still image and may be images consuming lower power or having a small data transfer amount as compared with a color moving image displayed at the conversation time or the operation time (use time). As such images, a monochrome still image, a color still image, a color image of eight colors, a simple moving image, a low frame frequency image, and the like can be<br><br>
named.<br>
Next, the case of displaying an image at the conversation time or operation time (use time) will be discussed. The control section 130 activates the selection signal (CS_ALL) supplied to the power supply section 120, whereby the gate driver 113 makes it possible to drive both the first and second display areas Ilia and 111b. In the case in FIG. 3, a full area display control signal is sent to the controller 117 as a part of a data signal from the second display data processing section (font generation section) 133 and control signal is supplied from the controller 117 to the power supply section 120.<br>
Color moving image data output from the display data processing section 140 is suppUed to the gate driver 113 and the source driver 115 of the display section 110. The color moving image data may be supphed to the controller 117 and supplied from the controller 117 to the gate driver 113 and the source driver 115, as shown in FIG. 2. The gate driver 113 supphes voltage complying with the display data to a gate electrode of the hquid crystal display section 111 and the source driver 115 supplies voltage complying with the display data to a source electrode of the Kquid crystal display section 111. The gradation of the hquid crystal display section 111 is controlled by the source driver 115.<br>
In the description of the operation, a monochrome still image is displayed in the first display area Ilia (partial display area) and a color still image is displayed in the first and second display areas Ilia and 111b (fuU display area); however, any combination of the images displayed in the partial display area and the fuU display area may be adopted if power consumption required when the image is displayed in the first display area Ilia (partial display area) is lower than that required when the image is displayed in the full display area or if the data transfer amount of the image displayed in the first display area Ilia is lower than that of the image displayed in the full display area. Combinations of a monochrome still image and a color moving image, a color stiU image and a color moving image, a half color image and a full color image, a<br><br>
low frame frequency image and a high frame frequency image, and the like are possible the combinations of the images displayed in the partial display area and the full display area.<br>
The liquid crystal display section 111 is divided into two parts in the gate direction as shown in FIG. 1 and in addition, it may be divided in gate direction X to provide display areas 111c and llle and divided in source direction Y to provide display areas llldand lllf, as shown in FIG. 4. Display data pieces c, d, e, and f to display in the display areas are supplied. The division positions of the hquid crystal display section 111 are fixed and in addition, the division positions may be changed over time to vary the display areas.<br>
To display images in the display areas 111c to lllf as shown in FIG. 2, a plurality of display data processing sections 140 shown in FIG. 1 are provided for supplying display data to the display areas provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the display data processing sections (see FIG.5). In this case, the display data processing sections 140a, 140b, 140c... can transfer data to the display section on different transfer periods via a plurality of data transfer paths 160a, 160b, 160c... corresponding to the display areas of the display section in response to the control signal of the control section 130 and can generate display data difi"erent in frame frequency and/or gradation.<br>
Further, the display areas may be driven on different power supply voltages and display data corresponding thereto may be generated.<br>
Specification may be made so as to display only an arbitrary display area of the display areas and not to display other display areas. That is, the power supply section 120 supplies power only to the arbitrary display area of the display section 110 and does not supply power to any other display area based on an instruction from the control section 130.<br>
Images different in format may be displayed on the whole liquid crystal display section 111 in order as shown in FIG. 6 without dividing the Liquid crystal display section 111.    In this case, as the display data supplied to the<br><br>
liquid crystal display section 111, if one display data processing section is provided (see FIG. 1), display data pieces 1 to 4 different in format are time-division multiplexed; if a plurality of display data processing sections are provided (see FIG. 5), they generate different display data pieces 1 to 4 in order.<br>
Further, the first display area 111a (partial display area) of the liquid crystal display section 111 and the first and second display areas 111a and 111b (full display area) (see FIG. 1) may be driven on different voltages. Likewise, the display areas 111c to 11 If (see FIG. 4) may be driven on different voltages and the fiquid crystal display section 111 (see FIG. 6) may be driven on different voltages in order. Thus, the drive voltage required in the standby mode can be lowered for suppressing power consumption.<br>
In the embodiment described above, the portable telephone is taken as an example, but the invention is not hmited to it and can also be applied to any other portable information terminal.<br><br><br>
