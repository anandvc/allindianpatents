Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a multipurpose, multifunctional composition for reducing the water absorption ability from concrete , more particularly a waterproofing and super plasticizer composition and preparation thereof, hereinafter called Protekta GL-5(M), which is very effective to imparts hydrophobicity to concrete and reduces the water absorption ability of the concrete by 80-90%.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Concrete admixtures are well known and are primarily used to reduce the water cement ratio and increasing its workability for eg salts of napthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensates (naphthalene derivatives), salts of melaminesulfonic acid / formaldehyde condensates (melamine, derivatives), salts of sulfanilic acid/phenol formaldehyde co-condensates (aminosulfonic acid derivatives), and salts of polycarboxylic acids (polycarboxylic acid derivatives) etc.<br>
The main disadvantage of these admixtures is to react with cement and give rise to undesirable side products and thus affecting the durability of the concrete. More over most of these admixtures are effective only for 30 minutes and after this period they are again added at the site tempering the concrete.<br>
The ready mixed concrete which is recommended to the customers has problem of slump retention, if they continue to use it with readily available admixtures in the market.<br><br><br>
However polycarboxyiate products are better since they work on steric hindrance. But they can not be used as admixtures as waterproofing because they are only useful in maintaining water cement ratio.<br>
Concrete is hydrophilic and therefore absorbs water, brings with it lot of toxic materials from the environment like chloride ions, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, resins and other materials. When this water finds an ingress point in the concrete id moves in the concrete and disturbs the alkaline passive protection to reinforcement, and causing corrosion.<br>
The only product which is well known as a waterproofing admixture is alkyl or alkaline salts of oleates &amp; stearates and sometimes acrylates.<br>
The main disadvantage of these products are not very effective and do not impart the hydrophobicity to the extent that it really requires and normally since their mechanism of action is based on enteric coating, they are vulnerable to outside factors like calcium hydroxide.<br>
Therefore there is a very critical and urgent requirement of developing a waterproofing admixture which can reduce water absorption of concrete by at least 80 - 90%. These compositions have problems, although each is useful in its own way. Some of the composition react with cement sometimes and give rise to undesirable side products and thus affecting the durability of the concrete.   More over most of these admixtures are<br><br>
effective only for 30 minutes and after this period they are again added at the site thus tempering the concrete.<br>
The ready mixed concrete which is recommended to the customers has problem of slump retention, if they continue to use it with readily available admixtures in the market.<br>
However polycarboxylate products are better since they work on steric hindrance. Any claims to call these compositions as waterproofing is wrong since they are only useful in maintaining water cement ratio. Therefore there is a very critical and urgent requirement of developing a waterproofing admixture which can reduce water absorption of concrete by at least 80 - 90%.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US patent no. 5911820 teaches a concrete admixture comprises a copolymer comprising, as structural units, units derived from an ethylenically unsaturated monomer (a) having 25 to 300 moles of C.sub.2 -C.sub.3 oxyalkylene groups and units derived from a monomer (b) of an alkyl, alkenyl or hydroxyalkyl ester of an ethylenically unsaturated mono- or di-carboxylic acid. Therefore, carboxyl groups which serves as an adsorbing group is gradually increased through hydrolysis of ester with an alkali to result in supplying a freshly formed dispersant, which may be the reason why the fluidity is not loared but maintained for a long period of time. When the copolymer has lengthened side chains by an increase in the mole number of oxyalkylene groups added, it exhibits an enhanced dispersing effect due to steric repulsion and therefore can impart fluidity even<br><br>
when a reduced amount is used. Therefore, the surface hydration of cement is little hindered to result in a slight retardation of the hardening property.<br>
US patent no. 7,048,793 teaches a compositions for modifying hydratable cementitious materials comprising (A) a lignosulfonic acid or salt thereof; an aldohexonic acid or salt thereof; an hexuronic acid or salt thereof; an hexaric acid or salt thereof; or mixture thereof; and (B) at least one aldopentonic acid or salt thereof.<br>
Patent WO/1995/022580 teaches an aqueous siloxane emulsion comprises: (i) hydrolysable alkylalkoxysiloxane, (ii) 0,1 % to 10 % by weight of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of an alkylamine alkoxylate, or, an acidified or partially acidified alkylamine alkoxylate, quaternary alkyl ammonium salts, acid alkylamine salts and imidazoline salts; and (iii) water. The invention also provides that up to 45 % by weight of the emulsion may be alkylalkoxysilane of the formula: R"n - Si - R"'4-n wherein R" is a hydrocarbyl group containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R"' is a hydrolysable group, and n is 1 or 2. These emulsions maintain high effective levels of the active silicone content on long term storage. The emulsions of the invention are useful in rendering permeable mineral substrates water repellent.<br>
US patent No. 5110684 teaches a method of rendering masonry architectural building materials water repellent by incorporating into the masonry architectural building material an additive comprising (i) a water soluble silane coupling agent and (ii) an emulsion which includes water, at least one surfactant, and a siloxane fluid. The siloxane fluid is one of a linear  <br><br>
methylalkyl siloxane copolymers, methylhydrogen cyclosiloxane polymers, or methylhydrogen-methylalkyl cyclosiloxane copolymers.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a multifunctional, multipurpose composition, which is very effective to impart hydrophobicity to concrete.<br>
Another object of the invention is to control water cement ratio, because if water is more than 0.3 -0.4, it reduces the compressive strength of the concrete and has adverse effects on the durability and sustainability of the concrete.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to increase the retention of slump for at the least 2 hrs.<br>

According to another embodiment of the invention a   waterproofing super plasticizer<br>
comprising  Component A and component  B  mixed  together with cellulose and<br>
aluminates.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention component A comprises oligomeric of<br>
mixture of alkyl triethoxy silane and siloxane and other oil soluble additives and<br>
surfactants.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention component B comprises aqueous<br>
polymer polycarboxylate mixture, wetting agent, aciticides, sugar and plasticizers.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention the component A and component B are mixed in a ratio of .5 to 5%.<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention a waterproofing and super plasticizer composition comprising component A comprising oligomeric mixture of silane- siloxane and other oil soluble additives in the presence a surfactant, component B having aqueous polymer polycarboxylate mixtures, wetting agents, acticides, sugar, small amount of other plasticizers such as Sodium Lignosulphonate, napthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensates and sodium gluconate ; cellulose , and aluminates.<br><br>
Component A<br>
Using oligomeric mixture of silane -siloxane and other oil soluble additives in the presence of a surfactant and this solution is stirred using homogenizer at a speed of 3000 -13500 RMP.<br>
Many organic silicones such as alkylalkoxysilanes, alkylalkoxysiloxanes, polysiloxanes can be used (but there are advantages and disadvantages with the choice of each component). While siloxane with large molecular weight achieve early water repellency but it has poor penetration ability due to the higher molecular weight. The advantages of using silanes either neat or dissolved in the solvents give high penetration ability but the volatility of silanes results in poor water repellency. Therefore the best combination is the oligomeric mixture of silanes and siloxanes. This emulsion needs a specific design of surfactant and several combination are tried like<br>
Emulsions or Impregnants<br>
Emulsion with anionic<br>
Emulsion with cationic<br>
Emulsion with mixed cationic &amp; nonionic<br>
Emulsion with acidified amine ethoxylate<br>

Different combination of surfactant systems are used, however the acidified alkylamine ethoxylate surfactants, Oleyl Amine low mole EO, Stearyl Amine low mole EO are found<br><br>
to be more suitable. These surfactants possess the properties of both cationic and nonionic surfactants and on neutralization with any weak acid preferably acetic acid and a resinous product is formed which is continuously stirred and to this surfactant mix, mixture of silane-siloxane is added drop wise and stirred for 2 hrs. This emulsion is passed through nanometer to achieve a smaller particle sized of the resultant aqueous emulsion.<br>
