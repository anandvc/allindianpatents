The present invention relates to an elevator and to a<br>
method for locking an elevator car in place.<br>
According to prior art, an elevator car can be locked<br>
in place by means of a separate locking device. In a<br>
prior-art solution, the elevator car is locked in<br>
place by means of a bolt, the elevator car being<br>
provided with an apparatus for pushing the bolt into a<br>
hole in a guide rail so as to lock the elevator car in<br>
place. Another prior-art solution is disclosed in spe-<br>
cification US 4,333,549, which describes a blocking<br>
apparatus for blocking an elevator car in place. The<br>
specification discloses a separate blocking apparatus<br>
by means of which the elevator car is blocked manually<br>
in place by using a separate blocking device. In this<br>
solution, the elevator car must always be blocked<br>
manually separately at each desired position and the<br>
aforesaid blocking device must always be locked and<br>
released manually by means of a tightening bolt. In<br>
these solutions, the problem is a slow and complicated<br>
arrangement for blocking the elevator car in place.<br>
Another problem is that the solutions proposed are not<br>
very well applicable for use e.g. in elevator solu-<br>
tions without counterweight.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the<br>
above-mentioned drawbacks and to achieve an easy and<br>
simple locking apparatus for locking an elevator car<br>
in place. The invention aims at achieving at least one<br>
of the following objectives. On the one hand, the in-<br>
vention aims at developing an elevator car without ma-<br>
chine room so as to allow more effective space utiliz-<br>
ation in the building and in the elevator shaft than<br>
before. This means that the elevator must be capable<br><br>
of being installed in a fairly narrow elevator shaft<br>
if necessary. On the other hand, the invention aims at<br>
permitting the use of the elevator's own safety equip-<br>
ment even during elevator installation and maintenance<br>
work without a need to add any separate additional<br>
safety devices or separate locking devices to the el-<br>
evator car. A further aim is to increase and ensure<br>
the safety of an elevator.<br>
The elevator, method and other embodiments of the in-<br>
vention are described hereinafter. Inventive embodi-<br>
ments are also presented in the description part of<br>
this application. The inventive content of the present<br>
application can also be defined in other ways. The in-<br>
ventive content may also consist of several separate<br>
inventions, especially if the invention is considered<br>
in the light of expressions or implicit sub-tasks or<br>
in view of advantages or sets of advantages achieved.<br>
In this case, some of the attributes contained in the<br>
claims below may be superfluous in respect of separate<br>
inventive concepts.<br>
By applying the invention, one or more of the follow-<br>
ing advantages, among others, can be achieved:<br>
-	the locking device locking the elevator in place by<br>
means of at least one safety gear can be easily used<br>
both during installation work and later during main-<br>
tenance work<br>
â€”	the locking of the elevator car in place is easy and<br>
cheap to implement<br><br>
-	the locking mechanism is simple as the locking of<br>
the elevator car in place is implemented using a<br>
safety gear provided in conjunction with the eleva-<br>
tor car, so there is no need for any separate addi-<br>
tional locking devices<br>
-	the invention enables the locking mechanism to be<br>
used all the time during the operation of the eleva-<br>
tor without having to make any separate installa-<br>
tions e.g. for the time of maintenance and/or in-<br>
stallation work<br>
-	the locking mechanism of the invention can also be<br>
implemented in a manner permitting the inclusion of<br>
a separate locking element for use during mainte-<br>
nance and/or installation work, which element pref-<br>
erably comprises a pedal for the transmission of a<br>
force to release the safety gear/safety gears and<br>
which can be taken along after maintenance work<br>
-	the locking element, preferably a pedal, included in<br>
the locking mechanism is easy to carry along and it<br>
is light in construction<br>
-	the locking mechanism provided with a separate lock-<br>
ing element can not be used incorrectly because, as<br>
pressing the pedal does not actuate the safety gear<br>
locking linkage to keep the safety gear released,<br>
the safety gear stops the elevator automatically<br>
-	the separate locking element can be quickly and<br>
easily installed in position in the elevator for<br>
the time of maintenance and/or installation work or<br>
in other situations where installation/maintenance<br>
personnel have to get onto the top of the elevator<br>
car.<br>
In the elevator of the invention, which preferably is<br>
an elevator without counterweight, wherein the eleva-<br><br>
tor car is suspended by hoisting ropes consisting of a<br>
single rope or a plurality of parallel ropes, and<br>
which elevator comprises a traction sheave which moves<br>
the elevator car by means of the hoisting ropes. The<br>
elevator has rope portions of the hoisting ropes going<br>
upwards and downwards from the elevator car. In addi-<br>
tion, the elevator has at least one safety gear fitted<br>
in conjunction with the elevator car and engaging a<br>
guide rail. The elevator car of the invention is<br>
provided with a rope elongation compensating device<br>
for maintaining the rope force ratio between rope por-<br>
tions going upwards and downwards from the car con-<br><br>
stant, and in that the elevator comprises an overspeed<br>
governor by means of which the safety gear is activ-<br>
ated during normal elevator operation in a situation<br><br>
where a predetermined speed of the overspeed governor <br>
is exceeded, and in that the elevator is provided with <br>
a locking device fitted in conjunction with the elev- <br>
ator car for locking the elevator car in place, said<br>
device comprising means for activating and releasing<br>
the at least one safety gear fitted on the elevator<br>
car.<br>
The method of the invention relates to locking the el-<br>
evator car in place in an elevator. The elevator car<br>
is at least partially suspended by hoisting ropes,<br>
said hoisting ropes consisting of a single rope or a<br>
plurality of parallel ropes. The elevator has a trac-<br>
tion sheave which moves the elevator car by means of<br>
the hoisting ropes, and the hoisting ropes of the el-<br>
evator comprise rope portions going upwards and down-<br>
wards from the elevator car. In addition, the elevator<br>
is provided with at least one safety gear fitted in<br>
conjunction with the elevator car and engaging a guide<br>
rail. In the method of the invention, at least one<br>
safety gear fitted in conjunction with the elevator<br><br>
car is activated and released by means of a locking<br>
device fitted in conjunction with the elevator car.<br>
By increasing the contact angle by means of a rope<br>
pulley functioning as a diverting pulley, the grip<br>
between the traction sheave and the hoisting ropes can<br>
be improved. This allows the car to be made lighter as<br>
well as smaller, thus increasing the space saving po-<br>
tential of the elevator. A contact angle of over 180Â°<br>
between the traction sheave and the hoisting rope is<br><br>
achieved by utilizing a diverting pulley or diverting<br>
pulleys. The need to compensate the rope elongation is<br>
due to the friction requirements to ensure a grip be-<br>
tween the hoisting rope and the traction sheave that<br>
is sufficient in respect of operation and safety of<br>
the elevator. On the other hand, it is essential to<br>
elevator operation and safety that the rope portion<br>
below the elevator car in an elevator solution without<br>
counterweight be kept sufficiently tight. This can not<br>
necessarily be achieved by using a spring or a simple<br>
lever.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to a few embodiment examples and<br>
the attached drawings, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 presents a diagram representing a traction<br>
sheave elevator without counterweight and a<br>
locking mechanism according to the invention,<br>
and<br>
Fig. 2 presents a diagrammatic illustration of an<br>
elevator according to the invention and its<br>
locking mechanism, which locking mechanism<br>
has been fitted to the car frame of the ele-<br>
vator.<br>
Fig. 1 presents an elevator without counterweight ac-<br>
cording to the invention, in which elevator a roping<br>
arrangement with a 2:1 suspension ratio is used in the<br>
portions of the hoisting ropes 3 above and below the<br>
elevator car 1 and DW roping is used between the trac-<br>
tion sheave 5 and the diverting pulley 7. Compensation<br>
of rope elongations and constant rope forces are im-<br>
plemented using a rope elongation compensating device<br>
as presented in Fig. 1, which produces a rope force<br>
ratio of T1/T2 = 2/1. In the elevator it is also pos-<br>
sible to use a different type of hoisting rope compen-<br>
sator, such as e.g. a lever or a tensioning wheel set<br><br>
or some other compensating device applicable for the<br>
purpose. In Fig. 1, the hoisting ropes run as follows.<br>
One end of the hoisting ropes is secured to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 25 fitted to hang on the rope portion com-<br>
ing downwards from diverting pulley 14. Diverting pul-<br>
leys 14 and 25 together with the anchorage 26 of the<br>
second end of the hoisting rope form a rope force com-<br>
pensating system, which in the case of Fig. 1 is a<br>
compensating sheave system. This compensating device<br>
is fitted in place in the elevator shaft. From divert-<br>
ing pulley 25, the hoisting ropes 3 go upwards and<br>
meet diverting pulley 14, which is mounted above the<br>
elevator car in the elevator shaft, preferably in the<br>
upper part of the elevator shaft, passing around it<br>
along rope grooves provided in the diverting pulley<br>
14. These rope grooves may be coated or uncoated, the<br>
coating consisting of e.g. a friction increasing mate-<br>
rial, such as polyurethane or some other appropriate<br>
material. From diverting pulley 14, the ropes go fur-<br>
ther downwards to a diverting pulley 9 fitted in place<br>
on the elevator car, and having passed around this<br>
pulley, the ropes 3 go further upwards in tangential<br>
contact with diverting pulley 6 to the traction sheave<br>
5. Diverting pulley is preferably fitted in the vicin-<br>
ity and/or in conjunction with the hoisting machine 4 .<br>
Between diverting pulley 6 and the traction sheave 5<br>
of the hoisting machine 4, the figure shows DW (Double<br>
Wrap) roping, in which roping the hoisting ropes 3 run<br>
in tangential contact with diverting pulley 6 upwards<br>
to the traction sheave 5, and having passed around the<br>
traction sheave 5 the hoisting ropes return to divert-<br>
ing pulley 6, pass around it and return back to the<br>
traction sheave 5. In Double Wrap roping, when divert-<br>
ing pulley 6 is substantially of the same size with<br>
the traction sheave 5, the diverting pulley 6 can also<br>
function as a damping wheel. In this case, the ropes<br>
going from the traction sheave 5 to the elevator car 1<br><br>
run via the rope grooves of diverting pulley 6, and<br>
the rope deflection caused by the diverting pulley is<br>
very small. It could be said that the ropes going from<br>
the traction sheave 5 to the elevator car only run in<br>
"tangential contact" with the diverting pulley 6. Such<br>
"tangential contact" serves as a solution damping the<br>
vibrations of the outgoing ropes and it can be applied<br>
in other roping solutions as well. An example of other-<br>
roping solutions is Single Wrap (SW) roping where the<br>
diverting pulley is substantially of the same size<br>
with the traction sheave of the hoisting machine and.<br>
the use of a diverting pulley is applied as a "tangen-<br>
tial contact wheel" as described above. In SW roping<br>
according to the example, the ropes are passed around<br>
the traction sheave only once, the contact angle be-<br>
tween the rope and the traction sheave being about<br>
180Â°, the diverting pulley is utilized only for "tan-<br>
gential contact" of the rope as described above, the<br>
diverting pulley functioning as a rope guide and as a.<br>
damping wheel for damping rope vibrations. Diverting<br>
pulleys 14,9,6 together with the hoisting machine 4<br>
form the suspension arrangement above the elevator:<br>
car, where the suspension ratio is the same as in the<br>
suspension arrangement below the elevator car, this<br>
suspension ratio being 2:1 in Fig. 1. From the trac-<br>
tion sheave 5, the ropes run further in tangential<br>
contact with diverting pulley 6 to diverting pulley 8,<br>
which is preferably fitted in place in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft. Having passed around diverting<br>
pulley 8, the ropes 3 go further upwards to a divert-<br>
ing pulley 18 fitted in place on the elevator car,<br>
pass around this pulley and then go further downwards<br>
to a diverting pulley 23 in the lower part of the ele-<br>
vator shaft, and having passed around it the ropes go<br>
further upwards and return the diverting pulley 25<br>
comprised in the compensating device. Having passed<br>
around this pulley, the hoisting ropes go further up-<br><br>
wards to the anchorage 26 of their second end disposed<br>
in a suitable place in the elevator shaft. Diverting<br>
pulleys 8,18,23 form the hoisting rope suspension ar-<br>
rangement and the rope portion below the elevator car.<br>
The elevator hoisting machine 4 and the traction<br>
sheave 5 and/or the diverting pulleys 6,14 disposed in<br>
the upper part of the elevator shaft may be mounted in<br>
place on the frame structure formed by the guide rails<br>
2 or on a beam structure at the upper end of the ele-<br>
vator shaft or they may be secured separately in the<br>
elevator shaft or in some other appropriate mounting<br>
arrangement. The diverting pulleys in the lower part<br>
of the elevator shaft may be mounted in place on the<br>
frame structure formed by the guide rails 2 or on a<br>
beam structure located in the lower part of the eleva-<br>
tor shaft or on some other appropriate mounting ar-<br>
rangement. The diverting pulleys on the elevator car<br>
may be mounted in place on the frame structure of the<br>
elevator car 1 or on a beam structure or beam struc-<br>
tures comprised in the elevator car or they may be<br>
mounted separately on the elevator car or some other<br>
appropriate mounting arrangement. In Fig. 1, the ele-<br>
vator is provided with at least one, preferably two or<br>
more safety gears 27 fitted in conjunction with the<br>
elevator car, which safety gears can be activated and<br>
released by means of a locking mechanism 28. By oper-<br>
ating the actuating element 30 of the locking mecha-<br>
nism 28, the safety gear 27 can be released, allowing<br>
the elevator to be moved and operated e.g. in mainte-<br>
nance mode. In this case, however, the locking mecha-<br>
nism 28 of the elevator is in its service position, in<br>
which position the safety gear 27 is in an activated<br>
state when the actuating element 30 is not acted on.<br>
When the locking mechanism of the elevator is in a<br>
normal position, the elevator safety gear 27 is in a<br>
released state and the elevator works in the normal<br>
way.<br><br>
Fig. 2 presents a locking mechanism according to the<br>
invention arranged in conjunction with the car frame<br>
of an elevator car, by means of which mechanism the<br>
elevator car can be locked in place e.g. during in-<br>
stallation and/or maintenance work. In the figure, the<br>
safety gear 227 is fitted to the car frame so that it<br>
will engage the elevator guide rails so as to lock the<br>
elevator car in place on the elevator guide rails. The<br>
elevator car may have more than one safety gear, pref-<br>
erably two or more safety gears fitted on it, each one<br>
of which can be actuated by means of the locking<br>
mechanism of the invention. The mechanism presented in<br>
Fig. 2 is in the position of normal elevator opera-<br>
tion, in which position the safety gear is activated<br>
by means of an overspeed governor 231, normally in a<br>
situation where a predetermined speed of the overspeed<br>
governor 231 is exceeded. The overspeed governor acti-<br>
vates the safety gear by means of a linkage 228 ac-<br>
cording to prior art. In the operating position off the<br>
locking mechanism, the linkage 228 activates the<br>
safety gear 227 immediately when the locking mechanism<br>
is turned to the operating position. To do this, using<br>
an actuating element 230, of which there may be more<br>
than one and they may be located anywhere on the ele-<br>
vator car, yet preferably on the top of the elevator<br>
car or in some other location easily accessible to a<br>
person working on the top of the elevator car, the<br>
safety gear 227 is acted on via the linkage 228 so as<br>
to release the safety gear. It is then possible to<br>
drive and/or move the elevator car. The elevator lock-<br>
ing mechanism may be provided with a switching element<br>
for indicating the state of the locking mechanism. For<br>
example, the switching element or elements may indi-<br>
cate when the locking mechanism is in the operating<br>
position, thus informing the elevator system about the<br>
state of the mechanism, and in this situation e.g.<br>
only operation in maintenance mode is possible. The<br><br>
locking mechanism may also comprise a so-called "dead<br>
man's switch", which is used for monitoring to ensure<br>
that when the actuating element 230 of the locking<br>
mechanism is released, the safety gear is activated,<br>
i.e. grips the guide rail immediately. This arrange-<br>
ment can be easily implemented by using e.g. a gas<br>
spring or some other arrangement applicable for the<br>
purpose, in which arrangement the safety gear is<br>
caused to be activated immediately after the user ac-<br>
tion on the actuating element of the locking mechanism<br>
ceases while the elevator locking mechanism is in the<br>
operating position. An elevator without counterweight<br>
may start moving in an uncontrolled manner only down-<br>
wards during e.g. installation, maintenance or normal<br>
operation because it has no counterweight. In the ele-<br>
vator of the invention, it is possible to use as<br>
safety devices during installation and maintenance<br>
work only the safety gears which can be activated and<br>
released by means of the locking mechanism. In addi-<br>
tion, the safety gears used may be of a type function-<br>
ing in one direction only, in other words, in the case<br>
of an elevator without counterweight, preventing es-<br>
cape in the downward direction only.<br>
Fig. 3 presents a locking mechanism according to the<br>
invention which can be included as a part of the ele-<br>
vator if necessary. For example, a serviceman can add<br>
the locking mechanism to an elevator when he has to<br>
work on the top of the elevator car. Fig. 3 presents a<br>
detachable locking element 332 that can be taken<br>
along. In the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 3, the<br>
locking element is preferably a pedal which is fitted<br>
in place on the elevator car or the frame of the ele-<br>
vator car, on brackets 333 provided for it, and added<br>
as a part of the safety gear locking linkage 330. When<br>
the pedal is pressed down e.g. by foot, the elevator<br>
safety gears will be released in the manner described<br><br>
in connection with Fig. 1 and 2, whereupon it is pos-<br>
sible to move the elevator car e.g. when the elevator<br>
is to be operated in maintenance mode. The pedal also<br>
functions as a so-called dead man's switch, which<br>
means that when the resistance to the pedal disap-<br>
pears, the safety gears will be activated, i.e. they<br>
will grip, preferably the guide rails of the elevator<br>
car. The locking element 332 together with its actua-<br>
tor can be advantageously placed on either side of the<br>
elevator car and the locking linkage 330, in which<br>
case the elevator car or the car frame of the elevator<br>
car may be provided with at least two mounting points<br>
and/or mounting brackets or other equipment on which<br>
and by means of which the locking element is secured<br>
in place. A serviceman can easily carry the locking<br>
element 332 along due to its light construction. In<br>
addition, the locking element can be easily and<br>
quickly mounted in place as a part of an elevator, and<br>
the locking element is cheap. In respect of operation,<br>
the locking element 332 is simple to mount in place,<br>
and its practically impossible to use it incorrectly<br>
because, when the locking device is not pressing the<br>
locking linkage 330 downwards, the equipment provided<br>
in the safety gear, preferably a gas spring or equiva-<br>
lent, activates the safety gear into the gripping po-<br>
sition and the elevator is stopped.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the elevator of the inven-<br>
tion is an elevator without machine room with machine<br>
above and with a drive machine provided, with a coated<br>
traction sheave, said elevator having thin and hard<br>
hoisting ropes of substantially round cross-section.<br>
In the elevator, the hoisting ropes have a contact an-<br>
gle exceeding 180Â° on the traction sheave and are im-<br>
plemented as DW roping in the hoisting machine, which<br>
hoisting machine comprises a traction sheave and a di-<br>
verting pulley, and which machine comes with the trac-<br><br>
tion sheave and diverting pulley ready fitted at a<br>
correct angle relative to each other. The hoisting ma-<br>
chine is secured to the elevator guide rails. The ele-<br>
vator is implemented without counterweight with a sus-<br>
pension ratio of 8:1 in such manner that both the sus-<br>
pension ratio in the roping above the elevator car and<br>
the suspension ratio in the roping below the elevator<br>
car is 8:1, and that the elevator roping runs in the<br>
space between one of the walls of the elevator car and<br>
a wall of the elevator shaft. The elevator is provided<br>
with a compensating device which maintains the ratio<br>
between the forces T1 / T2 as a constant ratio of 2:1.<br>
With the compensating device used, the required com-<br>
pensating distance is half the magnitude of the rope<br>
elongation. The elevator has a locking mechanism for<br>
locking the elevator car in place on the guide rails.<br>
A second preferred embodiment of the elevator of the<br>
invention is an elevator without counterweight wherein<br>
the suspension ratio above and below the elevator car<br>
is 10:1. In this embodiment, conventional elevator<br>
ropes, preferably of a diameter of 8 mm, and a trac-<br>
tion sheave made of cast iron at least in the rope<br>
groove area are used. The traction sheave has undercut<br>
rope grooves and the contact on the traction sheave<br>
has been fitted by means of a diverting pulley to be<br>
180Â° or more. When conventional 8-mm ropes are used,<br>
the traction sheave diameter is preferably 340 mm. The<br>
diverting pulleys used are large rope wheels which,<br>
when a conventional 8-mm hoisting rope is used, have a<br>
diameter of 320, 330, 340 mm or even more.<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that<br>
different embodiments of the invention are not limited<br>
to the examples described above, but that they may be<br>
varied within the scope of the claims presented below.<br>
For instance, the number of times the hoisting ropes<br>
are passed between the upper part of the elevator<br><br>
shaft and the elevator car and. between the elevator<br>
car and the diverting pulleys below it is not a very<br>
decisive question as regards the basic advantages of<br>
the invention, although it is possible to achieve some<br>
additional advantages by using multiple rope passages.<br>
In general, applications are so implemented that the<br>
ropes go to the elevator car from above as many times<br>
as from below, so that the suspension ratios in the<br>
suspension arrangements above and below the elevator<br>
car are the same. It is obvious to the skilled person<br>
that the linkage and/or actuating equipment of the<br>
locking mechanism can be implemented in other ways<br>
than those presented in the examples, e.g. by using<br>
various wire rope arrangements.<br>
It is obvious to the skilled person that the elevator<br>
of the invention can be implemented using almost any<br>
type of flexible hoisting means as hoisting ropes,<br>
e.g. flexible rope of one or more strands, flat belt,<br>
cogged belt, trapezoidal belt or some other type of<br>
belt applicable to the purpose. It is further obvious<br>
to the skilled person that the hoisting machine used<br>
in the elevator may be any type of elevator hoisting<br>
machine applicable for the purpose.<br>
It is also obvious to the skilled person that, in the<br>
elevator of the invention, the elevator can also be<br>
provided with a counterweight, in which elevator for<br>
example the counterweight preferably has a weight be-<br>
low the weight of the car and is suspended by separate<br>
ropes.<br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1.	An elevator, which is an elevator without counterweight, wherein<br>
the elevator car is suspended by hoisting ropes consisting of a<br>
single rope or a plurality of parallel ropes, and which elevater<br>

position, the safety gear is in an activated state and releasable by<br>
means of an actuating element and in the event of the locking device<br>
being in the normal position, the safety gear is in a released state<br>
and activable by means of the actuating element.<br>
2.	An elevator as claimed in claim 1, wherein, the locking device<br>
of the elevator has at least a first position, which is the normal<br>
position of the locking device, in which position the elevator and<br>
the safety gears work normally, and a second position, which is the<br>
operating position of the locking device, in which operating position<br>
at least one safety gear fitted on the elevator car is activated and<br>
the elevator car is locked in place.<br>
3.	An elevator as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein, the locking<br>
device of the elevator is provided with a "dead man's" switch.<br><br>
4.	An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein, the- elevator is provided with a switching element for<br>
detecting and indicating the position of the locking device.<br>
5.	An elevator as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein, the locking devices comprise a separate locking element<br>
(332), by means of which the elevator safety gears are locked and<br>
