				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING HETEROAROMATIC ALDEHYDE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a<br>
heteroaromatic aldehyde by catalytic reaction of an alkyl-substituted<br>
heteroaromatic compound with molecular oxygen in a gaseous phase.<br>
The heteroaromatic aldehyde is a useful compound for various<br>
applications such as an raw material for pharmaceutical and<br>
agricultural chemicals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a process for preparing a heteroaromatic aldehyde by<br>
catalytic reaction of an alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic compound<br>
with molecular oxygen, for example German Patent Application DD<br>
298234 Specification discloses a process for preparing 4-<br>
pyridinecarbaldehyde by catalytic reaction of 4-methylpyridine with<br>
molecular oxygen in a gaseous phase with divanadyl pyrophosphate<br>
[(VO)2P2O7] as a catalyst.<br>
The present inventors found that, as shown in Comparative<br>
Examples, selectivity of 4-pyridinecarbaldehyde was maximum of<br>
60.9 % in case of the catalytic reaction of 4-methylpyridine with<br>
molecular oxygen in the presence of divanadyl pyrophosphate as the<br>
catalyst in a gaseous phase. It was also found that, employing 3-<br>
methylpyridine instead of 4-methylpyridine, the selectivity of 3-<br>
aldehyde pyridine was also low in case of preparation of 3-<br><br>
pyridinecarbaldehyde by catalytic reaction of 3-methylpyridine with<br>
molecular oxygen in a gaseous phase.<br>
Further, according to knowledge of the present inventors, in<br>
case of employing divanadyl pyrophosphate as a catalyst, yield of the<br>
desired compound (4-pyridinecarbaldehyde, 3-pyridinecarbaldehyde)<br>
became extremely low by decreasing an amount of molecular oxygen to<br>
increase a concentration of the substrate (4-methylpyridine, 3-<br>
methylpyridine) in the reaction materials in order to improve<br>
productivity.<br>
Therefore, the processes described above is not satisfactory<br>
as the industrial process for preparing a heteroaromatic aldehyde such<br>
as pyridinecarbaldehyde, and a process which may prepare a<br>
heteroaromatic aldehyde in improved selectivity is desired.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process<br>
for solving the problems of the processes in the prior art, namely a<br>
process for preparing a heteroaromatic aldehyde by catalytic reaction<br>
of an alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic compound with molecular<br>
oxygen in a gaseous phase, wherein the heteroaromatic aldehyde is<br><br><br><br>
wherein the catalyst is an oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus,<br>
aluminium and silicon, and a part or all of the oxide is diluted with a<br>
solid inert to the reaction.<br>
Name of the Catalyst ?<br>
Namely, the present invention relates to a process for<br>
preparing a heteroaromatic aldehyde by catalytic reaction of an alkyl-<br>
substituted heteroaromatic compound with molecular oxygen in a<br>
gaseous phase in the presence of a catalyst, which comprises<br>
employing an oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and<br>
silicon as a catalyst, and diluting a part or all of the oxide present as a<br>
catalyst layer in a reactor with a solid inert to the reaction.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
The alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic compound of the<br>
present invention is a compound having at least one alkyl group<br>
bonding to a carbon atom of a heteroaromatic ring. As the alkyl group,<br>
examples are straight or branched alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms. Preferably, the compound has one or two nitrogen atoms as a<br>
hetero atom of the heteroaromatic ring and at least one of the above<br>
alkyl group. More preferably, examples thereof are an alkyl-<br>
substituted pyridine, an alkyl-substituted pyrazine and an alkyl-<br>
substituted pyrimidine having at least one alkyl group selected from<br>
the group consisting of methyl group and ethyl group, concretely the<br>
alkyl-substituted pyridine such as 2-methylpyridine, 3-methylpyridine,<br>
4-methylpyridine, 2-ethylpyridine, 3-ethylpyridine, 4-ethylpyridine,<br>
2,3-dimethylpyridine, 2,4-dimethylpyridine, 2,5-dimethylpyridine,<br>
2,6-dimethylpyridine, 3,4-dimethylpyridine, 3,5-dimethylpyridine, 2-<br><br>
methyl-5-ethylpyridine,	2,4,6-trimethylpyridine,	2,3,4-<br>
trimethylpyridine, 2,3,5-trimethylpyridine or 2,3,6-trimethylpyridine,<br>
the alkyl-substituted pyradine such as methylpyradine, ethylpyradine,<br>
2,3-dimethylpyradine, 2,5-dimethylpyradine, 2,6-dimethylpyradine,<br>
2-methyl-5-ethylpyradine or 2-methyl-6-ethylpyradine, the alkyl-<br>
substituted pyrimidine such as 2-methylpyrimidine, 4-<br>
methylpyrimidine, 5-methylpyrimidine, 2-ethylpyrimidine, 2,4-<br>
dimethylpyrimidine, 2,5-dimethylpyrimidine, 4,5-dimethylpyrimidine<br>
or 4,6-dimethylprimidine. The alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic<br>
compound may have other groups inert to the reaction in the present<br>
invention in addition to the alkyl group, for example at least one group<br>
selected from the group consisting of an aryl group, a halogen atom, a<br>
hydroxyl group and a cyano group.<br>
According to the present invention, the heteroaromatic<br>
aldehydes are obtained by oxidizing at least one alkyl group of the<br>
alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic compound to form formyl group (-<br>
CHO),.<br>
In the present invention, the oxide containing vanadium,<br>
phosphorus, aluminium and silicon is employed as a catalyst,. The<br>
preferable catalyst is oxide having the formula (I):<br>
VaVbAlcSidOe	(I)<br>
wherein a, b, c, d and e represent atomic ratios of vanadium,<br>
phosphorus, aluminium, silicon and oxygen respectively, b is 0.3 to 3,<br>
c is 0 (zero) to 2 excepting 0 (zero), d is 0 (zero) to 6 excepting 0 (zero)<br>
when a is 1, and e is decided by atomic valence of oxygen and atomic<br>
valences and atomic ratios of the other elements, more preferably oxide<br>
having formula (I) wherein b is 0.4 to 2, c is 0.3 to 1.5 and d is 0.1 to 5.5<br><br>
when a is 1.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention may be prepared by the<br>
generally known process for preparing an oxide catalyst. For example,<br>
vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon compounds are heated<br>
in a solvent such as water, and stirred. Then, the obtained mixture is<br>
concentrated, dried and calcined in air to obtain an oxide containing<br>
vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon of the catalyst of the<br>
present invention.<br>
There is no particular limitation for vanadium, phosphorus,<br>
aluminium and silicon compounds employed for the preparation.<br>
Examples thereof are a vanadium compound such as ammonium<br>
metavanadate, vanadium pentoxide, vanadyl oxalate or vanadyl<br>
phosphate; a phosphorus compound such as phosphoric acid,<br>
metaphosphoric acid, phosphorous acid or phosphate (for example,<br>
ammonium phosphate and the like); an aluminium compound such as<br>
aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium sulfate or<br>
aluminium phosphate; a silicon compound such as silicon oxide, silicic<br>
acid (such as silica gel or silica sol), silicate (such as sodium silicate,<br>
potassium silicate or ammonium silicate) or an alkoxyl silane (such as<br>
tetramethoxysilane or tetraethoxysilane).<br>
In the present invention, in order to dilute a part or all of the<br>
oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon,<br>
which is present as a catalyst layer in a reactor, with a solid inert to the<br>
reaction, there are employed the oxide and the solid inert to the<br>
reaction. In case that all of the catalyst layer consists only of the<br>
oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon, the<br>
desired heteroaromatic aldehyde is prepared with low selectivity.<br><br>
The solid inert to the reaction is a solid which does not act<br>
as a catalyst for the reaction of the present invention by itself, and does<br>
not promote a side reaction such as decomposition of the alkyl-<br>
sufostituted heteroaromatic compound, and further does not change<br>
property thereof under condition of the reaction in the present<br>
invention. Any solids as described above can be employed for the<br>
present invention. Preferably, it may be a solid conventionally<br>
employed as a carrier of a catalyst, examples thereof are silica, alumina,<br>
silica-alumina, silicon carbide, titanium oxide, diatomaceous earth,<br>
zeolite and the like.<br>
As a process for diluting a part or all of the oxide containing<br>
vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon with the solid inert to<br>
the reaction, examples are a method employing a mixture of a part or<br>
all of the oxide introduced into the reactor and the solid inert to the<br>
reaction, a method employing the oxide carried on the solid inert to the<br>
reaction, and the like.<br>
As a process for making the oxide containing vanadium,<br>
phosphorus, aluminium and silicon carried on the solid inert to the<br>
reaction, examples are a process comprising heating and stirring<br>
vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon compounds and the<br>
solid inert to the reaction in a solvent such as water, concentrating the<br>
obtained mixture, drying and calcining it under air, a process<br>
comprising impregnating an solid inert to the reaction with a solution<br>
of vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon compounds, drying<br>
and calcining it, a process comprising mixing an oxide containing<br>
vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon and the solid inert to<br>
the reaction optionally by employing a solvent such as water or a<br><br>
process comprising coating the solid inert to the reaction with an oxide<br>
containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon. The oxide<br>
containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon carried on<br>
the solid inert to the reaction, thus obtained, may be further mixed<br>
with a solid inert to the reaction and introduced into the reactor.<br>
The oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium<br>
and silicon (including the oxide carried on the solid inert to the<br>
reaction) may be employed for the reaction in the present invention by<br>
molding it to the desired shape such as column, cylinder, sphere, grain<br>
or fine grain. In preparing the oxide containing vanadium,<br>
phosphorus, aluminium and silicon carried on the solid inert to the<br>
reaction, the desired oxide in the desired shape is obtained by<br>
employing the solid inert to the reaction previously molded to the<br>
desired shape.<br>
In diluting a part or all of the oxide containing vanadium,<br>
phosphorus, aluminium and silicon with the solid inert to the reaction,<br>
a ratio of the oxide to the solid inert to the reaction in the catalyst layer<br>
is not particularly limited and may be suitably determined depending<br>
on the desired reaction, manner of the reaction, condition of the<br>
reaction and the like. Usually, as the ratio of the oxide containing<br>
vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon to the solid inert to the<br>
reaction in all of the catalyst layer, the later is determined from 0.1 to<br>
60 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 30 parts by weight based on 1 part<br>
by weight of the former, The ratio can be easily determined by<br>
previously carrying out an experiment in small scale.<br>
The heteroaromatic aldehyde of the present invention may<br>
be prepared by the reaction comprising feeding the mixed gas<br><br>
containing the alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic compound and<br>
molecular oxygen through the catalyst layer prepared by diluting a part<br>
or all of the oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and<br>
silicon with the solid inert to the reaction. As a reactor, there may be<br>
employed either a fixed bed reactor or a fluidized bed reactor.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail by<br>
employing the case employing the fixed bed reactor as an example. A<br>
reactor tube is packed with a part of the oxide containing vanadium,<br>
phosphorus, aluminium and silicon diluted with the solid inert to the<br>
reaction following the remained oxide as it is, or with all of the oxide<br>
containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon diluted with<br>
the solid inert to the reaction. As the oxide diluted with a solid inert to<br>
the reaction, there may be employed at least two oxides having<br>
different ratios of the oxide and the solid inert to the reaction.<br>
Preferably, the packing is carried out in such a manner that a ratio of<br>
the employed oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and<br>
silicon and the inactive solid for the reaction is introduced by<br>
increasing a concentration of the oxide from inlet side of the raw<br>
material mixed gas to outlet side of the gas produced by the reaction, or<br>
in such a manner that the concentration of the oxide becomes almost<br>
uniform in all of the catalyst layer.<br>
A ratio of the employed alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic<br>
compound to molecular oxygen is usually 0.4 to 5.0 moles, preferably<br>
0.4 to 3.0 moles, more preferably 1.1 to 2.1 moles of the molecular<br>
oxygen based on 1 mole of the alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic<br>
compound. As the molecular oxygen, air may be usually employed,<br>
but pure oxygen or the mixture thereof with air may be employed. In<br><br>
the course of the reaction, the mixed gas containing the alkyl-<br>
substituted heteroaromatic compound and molecular oxygen may be<br>
diluted with the inert gas such as nitrogen or water vapor, particularly<br>
in case of the reaction employing the fixed bed reactor, the inert gas is<br>
preferably employed to inhibit forming explosive mixture by the mixed<br>
gas. Preferable inert gas is water vapor. In case of employing the<br>
inert gas, an amount thereof is usually 15 to 50 moles, preferably 20 to<br>
30 moles based on 1 mole of the alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic<br>
compound.<br>
The catalyst layer in the reactor tube is usually heated from<br>
250 to 500°C, preferably from 280 to 450°C, and the mixed gas<br>
containing the alkyl-substituted heteroaromatic compound, molecular<br>
oxygen and optionally the inert gas in the ratio is feeded through the<br>
catalyst layer in a space-velocity (hereinafter referred to as SV) of<br>
usually 700 to 11000 hr-1, preferably 1500 to 5000 hr-1 to prepare the<br>
heteroaromatic aldehyde in a high yield. The reaction can be carried<br>
out under normal pressure, reduced pressure or elevated pressure.<br>
The reacted gas obtained by the reaction in the present<br>
invention is cooled as it is and/or bubbled into a suitable solvent for<br>
condensation of the heteroaromatic aldehyde and/or dissolving it in<br>
the solvent, then concentrated, extracted and evaporated to isolate the<br>
heteroaromatic aldehyde from the condensate and/or the solution.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is further concretely<br>
explained by Examples, but not limited thereto.<br>
Conversion, yield and selectivity were calculated according<br>
to the following definitions.<br>
Conversion (%) = Reacted Methylpyridine (mole) / Supplied<br><br>
Methylpyridine for Reaction (mole) * 100<br>
Yield (%) = Produced Pyridinecarbaldehyde (mole) / Supplied<br>
Methylpyridine for Reaction (mole) * 100<br>
Selectivity (%) = Produced Pyridinecarbaldehyde (mole) / Reacted<br>
Methylpyridine (mole) * 100<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of a catalyst<br>
There were mixed with 500 g of ion-exchanged water and 45.6<br>
g of 85 % phosphoric acid with stirring and the mixture was heated to<br>
90°C . To the aqueous phosphoric acid solution were added 30.0 g of<br>
vanadium pentoxide, 84.1 g of 10 % by weight of alumina sol and 19.8 g<br>
of silica gel. The obtained mixture was stirred at 90° C for 20 minutes<br>
and concentrated. Then the concentrate was dried at 200° C overnight<br>
and calcined under air at 640° C for 4 hours. Thus the oxide having<br>
V1P1.8A1.0 Si1.0 in an atomic ratio without oxygen was obtained.<br>
Preparation of 4-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
4-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared with the oxide as a<br>
catalyst. Grain size of the oxide having V1P1.8Al1.0Si1.0 in an atomic ratio<br>
without oxygen was uniformed to from 1.0 to 1.7 mm (10 to 16 mesh). A<br>
Pyrex reactor tube having 18 mm of an inside diameter was packed with 5<br>
ml of oxide having the grain size uniformed, and further packed with 5 ml<br>
of the oxide having the uniformed grain size diluted with 5ml of silicon<br>
carbide having the same grain size thereon. A packing ratio in the<br>
reactor tube of the oxide to silicon carbide (ratio by weight) was 1 to 0.62.<br>
The catalyst-packed portion in the reactor tube was heated to 350°C.<br><br>
A mixed gas containing 4-methylpyridine, water and air (mixing molar<br>
ratio was 4-methylpyridine : water : air = 1 : 30 : 10) was feeded from<br>
upper side of the reactor tube at SV = 1940 hr-1 to carry out the<br>
reaction. Reacted gas exhausted from the reactor tube was bubbled<br>
into 100 ml of water for 10 minutes to collect the reaction product in<br>
the reacted gas. The collecting liquid obtained was analyzed by gas<br>
chromatography. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>

to 34.2 g and 9.9 g, respectively.<br>
Preparation of 4-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
4-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared in the same manner as<br>

without oxygen obtained as described above and a heating temperature of<br>
the catalyst-packed part of the reaction tube was changed to 360° C. A<br>

oxygen was replaced by the oxide having V1P0.5Al0.5Si1.0in atomic ratio but<br>
oxygen obtained as described above and a heating temperature of the<br>
catalyst-packed portion of the reaction tube was changed to 300°C. The<br>

Divanadyl pyrophosphate was prepared by the following<br>
process based on the description of Japanese Examined Patent<br>
Publication No. 1981-45815.<br>
There were mixed 450.0 g of ion-exchanged water, 34.6 g of<br>
85 % phosphoric acid and 20.9 g of hydroxyl amine hydrochloride were<br>

87.4 %, and the yield and the selectivity of 4-pyridinecarbaldehyde was<br>
64.3 % and 73.5 %, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Preparation of a catalyst<br>
A catalyst was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1<br>
to obtain a oxide having V1P1.2A10.5Si5.0 in atomic ratio without oxygen,<br>
except that the amount of silica gel was changed to 99.0 g.<br>
Preparation 3-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared in the same manner as<br>
in Example 1, except that the oxide having V1P1.2A10.5Si1.0 in atomic ratio<br>
without oxygen was replaced by the oxide having V1P1.2A10.5Si5.0in atomic<br>
ratio without oxygen obtained as described above, 4-methylpyridine was<br>
replaced by 3-methylpyridine and a heating temperature of the catalyst-<br>
packed portion of the reaction tube was changed to 380°C. The ratio of<br>
the oxide to silicon carbide (ratio by weight) was 1 to 1.3. As results,<br>
conversion of 3-methylpyridine was 47.1 %, and yield and selectivity of<br>
3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was 17.3 % and 36.7 %, respectively.<br><br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of 3-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared in the same manner as<br>
in Example 5, except that the reactor tube packed with the oxide having<br>
V1P1.2Al0.5Si5.0 in atomic ratio without oxygen was replaced by the reactor<br>
tube packed with divanadyl pyrophosphate in Comparative Example 1<br>
and a heating temperature of the catalyst-packed portion of the reaction<br>
tube was changed to 390°C. As results, conversion of 3-methylpyridine<br>
was 56.2 %, and yield and selectivity of 3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was<br>
16.6 % and 29.5 %, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Preparation of 3-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared in the same manner as<br>
in Example 4, except that 4-methylpyridine was replaced by 3-<br>
methylpyridine and a heating temperature of the catalyst-packed portion<br>
of the reaction tube was changed to 430°C. As results, conversion of 3-<br>
methylpyridine was 57.7 %, and yield and selectivity of 3-<br>
pyridinecarbaldehyde was 19.9 % and 34.6 %, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Preparation of 2-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared in the same manner as<br>
in Example 4, except that 4-methylpyridine was replaced by 3-<br>
methylpyridine, the mixed gas was feeded from upper side of the reactor<br>
tube at SV = 3550 hr-1 arid a heating temperature of the catalyst-packed<br>
portion of the reaction tube was changed to 430 °C . As results,<br><br>
conversion of 2-methylpyridine was 50.7 %, and yield and selectivity of<br>
3-pyridinecarbaldehyde was 39.2 % and 77.3 %, respectively.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5<br>
Preparation of 2-pyridinecarbaldehyde<br>
2-pyridinecarbaldehyde was prepared in the same manner as<br>
in Example 7, except that the reactor tube was replaced by a reactor<br>
tube packed with divanadyl pyrophosphate in Comparative Example 1<br>
and a heating temperature of the catalyst-packed portion of the reaction<br>
tube was changed to 39°C. As results, conversion of 2-methylpyridine<br>
was 48.2 %, and yield of 2-pyridinecarbaldehyde was 12.7 % (the<br>
selectivity 26.3 %). Pyridine was also prepared at 12.9 % in yield. In<br>
case of employing the oxide (divanadyl pyrophosphate) containing<br>
vanadium and phosphorus and not containing aluminium and silicon<br>
as the catalyst, by increase of the amount of employed molecular<br>
oxygen, the yield of the heteroaromatic aldehyde may be increased, but<br>
by decrease of the amount of employed molecular oxygen, the yield is<br>
extremely decreased. On the other hand, according to the present<br>
invention, yield of the heteroaromatic aldehyde is high by employing<br>
the oxide containing vanadium, phosphorus, aluminium and silicon as<br>
a catalyst, even when an amount of employed molecular oxygen is<br>
decreased,.<br>
