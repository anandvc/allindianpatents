				<td>COMPOSITE-STEEL HYBRID MAST FOR ROTORCRAFT<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to masts for rotorcraft.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Traditional rotorcraft masts are fabricated from a steel forging, which typically<br>
comprises 4340 steel, 9310 low-alloy steel, or nitriding steel, such as nitralloy steel.<br>
All interfacing features are machined on the outside surface of the mast. These<br>
include splines for engaging with a planetary carrier in the rotorcraft's gearbox and a<br>
trunion of the rotor hub, bearing raceways, spinner support, etc.<br>
For example, as shown in Figure 1, a conventional steel mast 101 for<br>
rotorcraft (not shown) comprises an elongated tubular structure having an external<br>
wall 103 made of steel. Mast 101 typically includes one or more end fittings 105 and<br>
107 that allow mast 101 to be connected to the transmission, the rotor hub, and<br>
other components of the rotorcraft (not shown).<br>
A major section of the mast is exposed to the environment with minimum<br>
protection outside of the gearbox. This section is critically loaded while beihg<br>
susceptible to various kinds of damaging elements, such as debris blasts, sand<br>
blasts, chemical corrosion, and handling damage. All of these damaging elements<br>
may result in dangerous cracking on the mast surface. Because conventional masts<br>
are mission critical parts with no redundant or "fail-safe" structures, the failure of a<br>
mast may very likely result in the loss of lives and property.<br>
Although great strides have been made in the area of rotorcraft masts,<br>
significant shortcomings remain.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The novel features believed characteristic of the invention are set forth in the<br>
appended claims. However, the invention itself, as well as a preferred mode of use,<br>
 <br>
and further objectives and advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference<br>
to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which the leftmost significant digit(s) in the reference numerals<br>
denote(s) the first figure in which the respective reference numerals appear, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal, cross-sectional view of a conventional steel mast for<br>
a rotorcraft;<br>
Figure 2 is a longitudinal, cross-sectional view of an illustrative embodiment of<br>
a composite-steel hybrid mast for a rotorcraft;<br>
Figures 3-7 depict one particular, illustrative embodiment of a method for<br>
making the composite-steel hybrid masts of Figure 2 or Figure 8; and<br>
Figure 8 is a longitudinal, cross-sectional view of an illustrative embodiment of<br>
a composite-steel hybrid mast for a rotorcraft, alternative to the embodiment of<br>
Figure 2.<br>
While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative<br>
forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the<br>
drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that<br>
the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to<br>
the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all<br>
modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest<br>
of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this<br>
specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such<br>
actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to<br>
achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and<br>
business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another.<br>
 <br>
Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex<br>
and time-consuming but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
A composite-steel hybrid mast for a rotorcraft includes a tubular, steel portion<br>
having an internal surface defining a space therein and a composite portion disposed<br>
within the space defined by the internal surface of the steel portion and affixed to the<br>
internal surface of the steel portion.<br>
A method for making a composite-steel hybrid mast for a rotorcraft includes<br>
providing a tubular, steel portion comprising an internal surface defining a space<br>
therein; preparing a composite portion comprising a fiber-reinforced, polymeric,<br>
composite material on an expandable mandrel; and placing the expandable mandrel,<br>
with the composite portion thereon, into the space defined by the internal surface of<br>
the steel portion. The method further includes expanding the expandable mandrel,<br>
curing the composite portion, unexpanding the expandable mandrel, and removing<br>
the expandable mandrel from the composite portion.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2 in the drawings, a preferred embodiment of a<br>
composite-steel hybrid mast 201 for a rotorcraft is illustrated. Mast 201 is an<br>
elongated coaxial, tubular structure having an external, steel portion 203. Steel<br>
portion 203 of mast 201 includes one or more end fittings 205 and 207 that allow<br>
mast 201 to be connected to the transmission, the rotor hub, and other components<br>
of a rotorcraft (not shown).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, steel portion 203 of mast 201 maintains the same<br>
external features, external shape, and external dimensions of a conventional steel<br>
mast, such as mast 101 (shown in Figure 1). However, mast 201 includes an interior<br>
composite portion 209 that is made of a fiber-reinforced, polymeric, composite<br>
material, such as a carbon-reinforced epoxy material, a fiberglass-reinforced, epoxy<br>
material, or the like. Composite portion 209 is disposed within a space 211 defined<br>
by steel portion 203 and affixed to an internal surface 213 of external wall 203.<br>
Preferably, composite portion 209 is adhesively bonded to internal surface 213 of<br>
 <br>
steel portion 203. Internal surface 213 may include features, such as grooves or<br>
slots, such as grooves 301 of Figure 3, and/or surface treatments, which improve<br>
adhesive bonding and load transfer between steel portion 203 and composite portion<br>
209, as is described in greater detail herein.<br>
Still referring to Figure 2, composite portion 209 allows the thickness of<br>
selected portions of steel portion 203 to be reduced over conventional, all-steel<br>
masts, such as mast 101, thereby reducing the overall weight of mast 201.<br>
Specifically, composite portion 209 allows a thickness of a wall 215 of steel portion<br>
203 to be reduced, as compared to corresponding portions of conventional, all-steel<br>
masts, such as mast 101, in areas adjacent composite portion 209. Mast 201<br>
supports torque, thrust, shear, and bending moments.<br>
Interior composite portion 209 may be formed of a fiber-reinforced, composite<br>
material fabricated with any process, including, for example, tape-placement; fiber-<br>
placement; filament-winding; braiding and resin transfer molding (RTM), hand layup,<br>
or the like.<br>
Figures 3-5 depict one particular, preferred embodiment of a method for<br>
making a composite-steel hybrid mast, such as mast 201. Referring in particular to<br>
Figure 3, a fiber preform 302 of interior composite portion 209 is formed by braiding<br>
dry reinforcing fibers around an unexpanded but expandable mandrel 303. In one<br>
embodiment, expandable mandrel 303 comprises an elastomeric material configured<br>
as a "balloon," such that the elastomeric material defines an internal cavity into which<br>
a fluid can be introduced under pressure to inflate expandable mandrel 303.<br>
Preferably, however, expandable mandrel 303 is a segmented, metallic, expandable<br>
mandrel. It is preferable, but not required, that mandrel 303 have controlled external<br>
dimensions. Resin, such as an epoxy resin, is dispersed in fiber preform 302, such<br>
as by soaking fiber preform 302 in the resin.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, expandable mandrel 303, with fiber preform 302<br>
disposed thereon, is then inserted into steel portion 203 of mast 201. As shown in<br>
Figure 5, expandable mandrel 303 is then expanded toward internal surface 213 of<br>
 <br>
steel portion 203. In one embodiment, expandable mandrel 303 is expanded by<br>
introducing a gas, such as air, nitrogen, or the like, into an internal cavity defined by<br>
expandable mandrel 303 via a port 305. In another embodiment, expandable<br>
mandrel 303 is expanded by mechanically actuating segments of expandable<br>
mandrel 303 toward internal surface 213 of steel portion 203. Steel portion 203, fiber<br>
preform 302, and mandrel 303 are placed in a resin transfer molding tool 501,<br>
represented by a phantom line in Figure 5, as is known in the art. Resin, such as<br>
epoxy resin, is introduced into fiber preform 302 while fiber preform is under vacuum<br>
to efficiently transfer resin into fiber preform 302 and to remove gases in fiber<br>
preform 302. Resin and fiber preform 302 forms interior composite portion 209.<br>
Steel portion 203 and composite portion 209 are then heated to cure the resin of<br>
composite portion 209 while composite portion 209 is in contact with internal surface<br>
213 of steel portion 201 to form a rigid composite portion 209 and adhesively bond<br>
composite portion 209 to internal surface 213 of steel portion 201. Preferably, the<br>
curing operation occurs under vacuum.<br>
It should be noted that the present invention contemplates forming composite<br>
portion 209 by methods other than resin transfer molding. For example, reinforcing<br>
fibers that are impregnated with resin, known as a composite "prepreg" material, may<br>
be placed or "laid-up" on expandable mandrel 303.<br>
It will be appreciated that specialized tools, such as an autoclave, an oven, a<br>
gas compressor, a vacuum pump, one or more material handling tools, or the like<br>
may be used to facilitate the operation and to complete the curing process. It should<br>
also be noted that thermal residual stresses due to the difference in the coefficients<br>
of thermal expansion between composite portion 209 and steel portion 203 at the<br>
interface between composite portion 209 and inner surface 213 of steel portion 203<br>
and caused by the curing process are always in compression, which inhibits or<br>
prevents composite portion 209 from inadvertently becoming dislodged from steel<br>
portion 203. Because composite portion 209 is cured at elevated temperatures and<br>
steel portion 203 has a larger coefficient of thermal expansion than composite<br>
portion 209, steel portion 203 is in compression about composite portion 209 when<br>
at operational temperatures, which are lower than the curing temperatures. In some<br>
 <br>
embodiments, the residual compressive stresses are sufficient to maintain a fixed<br>
spatial relationship between composite portion 209 and inner surface 213 of steel<br>
portion 203. In other embodiments, however, composite portion 209 is bonded to<br>
inner surface 213 of steel portion 203, for example, by bonding of the resin of<br>
composite portion 209 to inner surface 213 or by bonding via additional adhesive<br>
material, as is discussed in greater detail herein.<br>
In one particular embodiment, however, at least one ply of adhesive film is<br>
added to at least a portion of the interface 213 of composite portion 209 and steel<br>
portion 203 to enhance the synergy of these two elements of mast 201. Before<br>
interior composite portion 209 and mandrel 303 are inserted into steel portion 203,<br>
internal surface 213 of steel portion 203 may be selectively treated by suitable<br>
processes, such as chemical processes, mechanical processes, thermal processes,<br>
and/or combinations thereof, to improve the adhesive bonding and load transfer<br>
between interior composite portion 209 and exterior steel portion 203. One example<br>
of a chemical process is the preparation of surface 213 of steel portion 203 with a<br>
chemical agent, such as phosphate fluoride; the application of an adhesive primer;<br>
and the "tackification" of adhesive film onto surface 213. For the purposes of this<br>
disclosure, the term "tackification" means lightly sticking the adhesive film onto inner<br>
surface 213 of steel portion 203. One example of a mechanical process is the<br>
machining of shallow slots or grooves, such as grooves 301, 307, and/or 309 in<br>
internal surface 213 of steel portion 203, as shown in Figure 3. It should be noted<br>
that grooves 301, 307, and 309 are merely examples of such grooves that can be<br>
defined by internal surface 213 of steel portion 203 and that other groove shapes<br>
and geometries exist. Moreover, it should be noted that grooves or slots, such as<br>
grooves 301,307, and/or 309, of steel portion 203 are not required.<br>
After mast 201 is cured, mandrel 303 is unexpanded or collapsed, as shown<br>
in Figure 6 and removed, as shown in Figure 7. In one embodiment, mandrel 303 is<br>
unexpanded or collapsed by withdrawing the fluid, for example, a gas such as air or<br>
nitrogen, from within mandrel 303. Surfaces of mast 201 and/or mandrel 303 are<br>
cleaned, as desired.<br>
 <br>
Referring to the embodiment of Figure 2, end surfaces 217 and 219 of<br>
composite portion 209 are tapered. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 8, end surfaces<br>
217 and 219 are filleted, exhibiting a radius R1 or R2, respectively. If filleted or<br>
tapered surfaces 217 and 219 are not produced by expandable mandrel 303 and<br>
"molded in," filleted or tapered surfaces 217 and 219 are machined at ends of<br>
composite portion 209, if desired. Generally, filleted or tapered surfaces 217 and<br>
219 minimize the interface shear stress caused by torque transition from steel<br>
portion 203 into composite portion 209 and from composite portion 209 into steel<br>
portion 203 and provide a smooth torque transition. The interface shear stress<br>
outside the transition zones is zero, except in the area where the wall thickness of<br>
steel portion 303 or composite portion 209 changes, according to the linear theory of<br>
strength of materials. The optimal dimension of filleted or tapered surfaces 217 and<br>
219 is implementation specific and preferably tailored through stress analysis. It<br>
should be noted, however, that filleted or tapered surfaces, such as surfaces 217<br>
and 219, of composite portion 209 are not required in every embodiment.<br>
The thicknesses and diameters of steel portion 203 and composite portion<br>
209 can be tailored to have the torsional stiffnesses and bending stiffnesses to meet<br>
selected dynamics requirements. In one particular embodiment, both composite<br>
portion 209 and steel portion 203 carry at least one of lift, thrust, torsion, and<br>
bending loads, such that hybrid mast 201 as a whole meets the structural design<br>
criteria for static and fatigue. The load distribution among composite portion 209 and<br>
steel portion 203 is determined by the respective wall thicknesses and diameters.<br>
For example, mast 201 can be designed such that composite portion 209 alone is<br>
capable of carrying design limit load which is the maximum obtainable load under a<br>
normal operating condition. Therefore, an unexpected crack growth or propagation<br>
in steel portion 203 will not propagate into composite portion 209 immediately, thus<br>
preventing catastrophic failure. This is a 'fail-safe' feature of steel-composite hybrid<br>
mast. This makes mast 201 more reliable and durable than traditional steel masts.<br>
Because steel portion 203 is exposed to hostile environments and to most sources of<br>
damage, it is likely that any undesirable cracks or other damage will initiate in steel<br>
portion 203.<br>
 <br>
Composite-steel hybrid masts provide dual load paths for any type of<br>
rotorcraft, including helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft, both manned and unmanned.<br>
Composite-steel hybrid masts allow for optimization of the hybrid design for<br>
maximum structural integrity with minimum weight.<br>
The composite-steel hybrid mast has significant advantages, including: (1) the<br>
dual load paths, i.e., composite and steel, make the rotor mast more reliable and<br>
more durable as opposed to the single load path design of the traditional rotor mast;<br>
and (2) the weight of a rotor mast can be reduced depending upon the model of<br>
aircraft and the type of application, because of the lighter weight of the composite<br>
material.<br>
The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the<br>
invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein.<br>
Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design<br>
herein shown, other than as described in the claims below. It is therefore evident that<br>
the particular embodiments disclosed above may be altered or modified and all such<br>
variations are considered within the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly,<br>
the protection sought herein is as set forth in the claims below. It is apparent<br>
that an invention with significant advantages has been described and illustrated.<br>
Although the present invention is shown in a limited number of forms, it is not limited<br>
to just these forms, but is amenable to various changes and modifications without<br>
departing from the spirit thereof.<br>
