				<td>Novel enzymatic substrates derived from phenoxazinone and their use as<br>
developer in detection of microorganisms with peptidase activity<br>
The present invention relates to novel chromogenic enzymatic substrates for the<br>
detection of peptidase activity. These substrates can be used in applications comprising<br>
an enzymatic hydrolysis step that produces a physicochemical signal, in particular in<br>
microbiology, biochemistry, immunology, molecular biology, histology, etc. Compared<br>
with the existing substrates, most of which are only fluorigenic, the chromogenic<br>
substrates of the invention can be used in particular in a gelled medium for the<br>
detection of microorganisms since they produce a coloration that does not diffuse in the<br>
reaction medium and is therefore concentrated within the colonies.<br>
The invention also relates to reaction media containing such substrates, to the<br>
use of the substrates or the media for detecting Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive<br>
bacteria and yeasts expressing a peptidase activity, and to methods of use.<br>
An enzyme is generally called an aminopeptidase if it is capable of cleaving by<br>
hydrolysis the amide group formed between an acyl of an amino acid and a primary<br>
amine, and an enzyme is generally called a peptidase if it is capable of cleaving by<br>
hydrolysis the amide group formed between the acyl residue of a peptide and a primary<br>
amine. In the present application, the term "peptidase" can denote, as appropriate, both<br>
a peptidase and an aminopeptidase as defined above.<br>
Enzymatic chromogenic substrates for the detection of peptidase activity that do<br>
not diffuse are described and already known in the prior art. Thus, such substrates are<br>
covered by patent applications WO98/04735 and WO99/38995 filed by the applicant.<br>
However, these substrates have various drawbacks: they are difficult to synthesize, the<br>
purity is low and the yields are low. Furthermore, for use in culture media, a very<br>
precise medium composition must be defined in order to observe a color.<br>
The only existing substrates that can be used in solid media for the detection of<br>
microorganisms in mixed cultures are acridine-derived substrates and are described in<br>
PCT patent application WO2004/069804 filed by the applicant.<br>
Molecules derived from phenoxazinone are known for their ability to produce<br>
fluorescence. They can be used :<br>
-as acid-base indicators, as described, for example, in Stuzka, V. et al, 1963,<br>
Collection Czech. Chem. Commun., 28, 1399-1407, or else<br>
- as fluorescent labels, for example for following conformation of modifications of<br>
proteins, as described in Nakanishi J. et al., 2001, Analytical Chemistry, 73(13), 2920-<br>
2928, or else, for example, for the detection of microorganisms as described in US<br>
patent 5,336,600. In the latter case, the compounds described have the drawbacks that<br>
they can only be used in liquid media and that the detection of the microorganisms,<br>
which occurs via the demonstration of bacterial growth, is carried out by modification<br>
of the redox potential. There is therefore no specificity in relation to an enzymatic<br>
activity nor in relation to a bacterial genus or species.<br>
No aminophenoxazinone derivative currently described, and in particular no<br>
resorufamine derivative, has ever been used as a chromogenic enzymatic substrate that<br>
can be used in a gelled medium.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, novel chromogenic enzymatic<br>
substrates for detecting microorganisms expressing a peptidase activity are proposed.<br>
The invention also relates to reaction media containing such substrates, and also to the<br>
use of the substrates or of the media for detecting peptidase activities, and to methods<br>
of use.<br>
The applicant has found, surprisingly, that it is possible to detect<br>
microorganisms expressing a peptidase activity by using novel chromogenic<br>
phenoxazinone derivatives which produce a coloration that does not diffuse in the<br>
reaction medium and is therefore concentrated at the colonies, the peptidase activity<br>
being demonstrated by a modification of the coloration of the colonies in the culture<br>
medium.<br>
After inoculation of the reaction media containing the substrates of the<br>
invention, with the microorganisms to be tested, colonies which are colorless-to-white<br>
are observed when they are not capable of hydrolyzing the substrate. On the other hand,<br>
colored colonies are observed when they are capable of hydrolyzing the substrate of the<br>
invention.<br>
The phenoxazinone derivatives of the invention are both chromogenic and<br>
fluorigenic and have the advantage of having a good detection sensitivity. In addition,<br>
the excitation and the emission of the fluorescence take place in the visible spectrum,<br>
such that the fluorescence can be detected by the naked eye and under normal<br>
illumination.<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is chromogenic enzymatic substrates of<br>
formula (I):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which<br>
- RI represents a hydrogen atom, a C1-C12alkyl group, a C1-C12 aralkyl group, an aryl<br>
group, -COOH, -COOR' or-NR"R'",<br>
-Ra represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-C12 alkyl group, -COOH or<br>
-COOR',<br>
- RS represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-C12 alkyl group, -CN, -CONH2,<br>
-COOR1 or -COR,<br>
- R4, RS and Re each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, -COOR'<br>
or a C1-C12 alkyl group, it being understood that at least one of R4, RS and R&amp; is a<br>
hydrogen atom,<br>
- R' represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C12, alkyl group,<br>
- R" and R1" each independently represent a C1-C12 alkyl group, or else R" and R'",<br>
together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring<br>
containing one or more heteroatoms,<br>
- A represents at least one amino acid, and<br>
- X represents a blocking agent or nothing.<br>
According to the invention, the term "aryl" is in particular intended to mean a<br>
C1-C12aromatic ring, especially phenyl, benzyl, 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl. The same is<br>
true of the aryl part of the aralkyl groups. Thus, the alkyl group of theC1-C12 aralkyl<br>
PC<br>
group is C2-C8.<br>
The term C1-C12 alkyl group" is intended to mean a straight or branched alkyl<br>
having from x to y carbon atoms, in the present case from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, from 1<br>
to 6 carbon atoms, or from 1 to 3 carbon atoms or from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. By way of<br>
example, mention may be made of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tbutyl,<br>
pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl and dodecyl.<br>
The term "halogen atom" is intended to mean chlorine, bromine, iodine or<br>
fluorine.<br>
The term "heteroatom" is intended to mean an atom other than a carbon atom,<br>
for instance O, N or S.<br>
The heterocyclic rings that R" and R"' can form may be of any size, but they<br>
preferably contain from 5 to 7 ring members.<br>
Examples of a heterocyclic ring include the morpholine, piperazine, piperidine,<br>
pyrrolidine and imidazolidine rings.<br>
The blocking agents according to the invention include any blocking agent<br>
known to those skilled in the art which is capable of protecting amines. By way of<br>
example, mention may be made of t-butoxycarbonyl (N-tBOC), 9-<br>
fluorenyloxycarbonyl, a solubilizing agent such as succinyl, or else a nonmetabolizable,<br>
i.e. unnatural, amino acid such as pipecolic acid.<br>
The blocking agents are not systematically present in the compounds of the<br>
invention. In this case, i.e. when the compounds of the invention do not have a blocking<br>
agent (X is nothing), the compounds of the invention are in the form of a salt such as<br>
chloride, bromide or trifluoroacetate.<br>
The amino acids that are represented by A in formula (I) are any amino acid<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to a specific embodiment, a subject of the present invention is also<br>
chromogenic enzymatic substrates of formula (I):<br>
R<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which<br>
- RI represents a hydrogen atom, a C1-C12 alkyl group, a C1-C12 aralkyl group, an aryl<br>
group, -COOH, -COOR' or-NR"R"',<br>
- R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-C12 alkyl group, -COOH or<br>
-COOR',<br>
it being understood that at least one of RI and R2 is a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom,<br>
- R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, -CN, -CONH2, -COOR1 or -COR',<br>
- R4, RS and R$, each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-C12 alkyl group,<br>
it being understood that at least one of Rj, RS and R$ is a hydrogen atom,<br>
- R' represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C12 alkyl group,<br>
-R" and R'" each independently represent aC1-C12 alkyl group, or else R" and R'",<br>
together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring<br>
containing one or more heteroatoms,<br>
- A represents at least one amino acid, and<br>
- X represents a blocking agent or nothing.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, A represents an amino acid or a<br>
peptide having at most 10 amino acids, in which the amino acids are identical or<br>
different. Preferably, in the interests of cost of the substrate, A represents an amino acid<br>
or a peptide having at most 4 amino acids, in which the amino acids are identical or<br>
different.<br>
Among the amino acids suitable for the purposes of the invention, mention may,<br>
for example, be made of cc-alanine and p-alanine, leucine, proline and pyroglutamine.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the invention<br>
for which RI represents an alkyl group and R2 represents a hydrogen group are<br>
preferred. More preferably, RI represents a C1-C12, or even C1-C12 alkyl group, methyl<br>
and pentyl being particularly preferred.<br>
The compounds for which RI represents a hydrogen atom and R2 represents a<br>
C1-C12 alkyl group constitute another embodiment of the invention. The compounds for<br>
which RI represents an ethyl or hexyl group are preferred.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention are such<br>
that RS, RI, RS and R(6each represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
According to another embodiment, the compounds for which RI and R2<br>
represent an alkyl group or a halogen atom and R* represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group or -COOR, where R' is an alkyl group, are also preferred. Preferred alkyl groups<br>
are C1-C12 preferably C\, alkyl groups.<br>
According to another embodiment, the compounds for which RI, R2, RB and R4<br>
are alkyl groups or a hydrogen atom are also preferred. Alkyl groups that are preferred<br>
are C1-C12 preferably Ci, alkyl groups.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared according to the procedure<br>
represented in scheme 1 below :<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
According to scheme 1, the appropriate dichloroimine (3) is prepared by<br>
oxidative chlorination of appropriately substituted p-phenylenediamine (1) in the<br>
presence of compound (2) according to the Willstaetter and Mayer protocol (1904). The<br>
dichloroimine (3) thus obtained is then condensed in an ethanolic solution with<br>
appropriately substituted resorcinol (4) so as to give resorufamine (5). The<br>
resorufamine (5) is then reacted with one or more optionally protected amino acids (6)<br>
in a bath cooled to approximately -12°C, to give the compound of formula (I). It should<br>
be noted here that, of course, when A is a single amino acid, A' in compound (6)<br>
corresponds to A of compound (I), but containing an additional hydroxyl group. In<br>
other words, when A is a single amino acid, A' ends with -C(O)OH, whereas A is<br>
connected to -NH- via -C(O)-, losing -OH. When A is a chain of at least two amino<br>
acids, the last amino acid of A' is as described above, i.e. it contains, compared with the<br>
last amino acid of A, an additional hydroxyl group.<br>
This process can be used to prepare all the compounds of the invention.<br>
However, preferably, the compounds of formula (I) for which R\ or R2 is an alkyl group<br>
can be prepared according to the protocol described in scheme 2 below.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
In scheme 2 above, the nitroso compound (8) is prepared by reaction of an<br>
appropriately substituted 3-aminophenol (7) with an alkali metal nitrite, such as sodium<br>
nitrite, in the presence of phosphoric acid or of sulfuric acid, at a temperature of from 0<br>
to -3°C. The nitrosoacetamidophenol compound (8) thus obtained is then reacted with<br>
an appropriately substituted resorcinol (4) in a solvent such as propanol or butanol, in<br>
the presence of sulfuric acid as acid catalyst, and a cyclization agent. The<br>
acetamidophenoxazinone thus obtained is deacetylated by means of a brief period of<br>
heating in the presence of sulfuric acid at 90°C, which process is followed by cooling<br>
and by an aqueous precipitation. The resorufamine (5) thus obtained is then reacted<br>
with one or more optionally protected amino acids (6) as indicated in the protocol of<br>
scheme 1.<br>
The compounds can also be prepared according to the following protocol, as<br>
represented in scheme 3 :<br>
Scheme 3<br>
Synthesis of substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenols<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In scheme 3 above, the compounds of the invention are prepared in 4 stages.<br>
According to the first stage, the appropriately substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenol<br>
compound (12) is prepared from a hydroquinone compound (9), also appropriately<br>
substituted. This compound (9) is added in dimethylformamide (DMF) with NaH, and<br>
then with methyl iodide, which reaction is followed by stirring at 40°C, to give the<br>
appropriately substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl compound (10). This compound is then<br>
added in trifluoroacetate (TFA) with urotropin under reflux according to the Duff<br>
reaction (Smith WE, 1972, J Org. Chem., 37 : 3972), to give the appropriately<br>
substituted 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (11). Finally, compound (11) is added in<br>
methanol with magnesium monoperoxyphthalate at 0°C, and then DMF with NaOH<br>
according to the Bayer-Villiger reaction (Capecchi T., et al., 2000, J. Chem. Soc.,<br>
Perkin Trans. 1, 2681), to give the appropriately substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenol (12).<br>
According to the 2nd stage, the 2,5-dinitrofluorobenzene (17) is prepared from<br>
an appropriately substituted fluoroaniline (13). This compound (13) is added at 0°C in<br>
triethylamine and dichloromethane (DCM) with acetyl chloride, to give the<br>
appropriately substituted N-acetylfluoroaniline (14). This compound is then added with<br>
a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and of nitric acid in acetic acid, to give the<br>
appropriately substituted nitroaniline compound (15). This compound (15) is brought to<br>
reflux with hydrochloric acid, to give the nitroaniline compound (16) which is itself<br>
added in acetic acid with sodium perborate at 65°C, to give the compound (17).<br>
According to the 3rd stage, the resorufamine (5) is obtained by reaction of the<br>
2,5-dimethoxybenzene (12) obtained in the 1st stage and of the 2,5-dinitrofluorobenzene<br>
(17) obtained in the 2nd stage, as follows : compounds (12) and (17) are added in DMF<br>
with NaH at ambient temperature, to give the appropriately substituted diaryl ether (18).<br>
This compound (18) is then added in DCM with BBrs, to give the dihydroxydiaryl ether<br>
(19) which is itself added to methanol in the presence of the Pd/C catalyst, to give the<br>
resorufamine (5).<br>
Finally according to the last stage, the resorufamine (5) thus obtained is then<br>
mixed with one or more optionally protected amino acids (6), as indicated in the<br>
protocol of scheme 1.<br>
In the above protocols, the starting reactants (compounds (1), (2), (4), (6), (7),<br>
(9) and (13)) are commercially available, in particular from Sigma.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a reaction medium comprising at least one<br>
chromogenic enzymatic substrate of formula (I) as defined above, alone or in<br>
combination with at least one other enzymatic substrate specific for an enzymatic<br>
activity other than that detected by the substrate according to the invention.<br>
In fact, when microorganisms expressing a peptidase activity are inoculated into<br>
or onto a reaction medium containing the compounds of the invention, a coloration<br>
occurs which does not diffuse in or on the reaction medium and is therefore<br>
concentrated at the colonies.<br>
According to the invention, the term "reaction medium" is intended to mean a<br>
medium that allows the development of at least one enzymatic activity of at least one<br>
microorganism.<br>
This reaction medium can either be used only as a developing medium, or as a<br>
culture and developing medium. In the first case, the culturing of the microorganisms is<br>
carried out before inoculation, and, in the second case, the reaction medium also<br>
constitutes the culture medium, and this constitutes a specific embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
The reaction medium may be solid, semi-solid or liquid. The term "solid<br>
medium" is intended to mean, for example, a gelled medium.<br>
Agar is the conventional solid medium in microbiology for culturing<br>
microorganisms, but it is possible to use gelatin, agarose or another gelling agent. A<br>
certain number of preparations are commercially available, for instance Columbia agar,<br>
trypcase-soy agar, MacConkey agar, Sabouraud agar or, more generally, those described<br>
in the Handbook of Microbiological Media (CRC Press).<br>
Preferably, when the reaction medium is also a culture medium, it is in gel form.<br>
The amount of agar in the reaction medium is from 2 to 40g/l. For the solid<br>
media, the amount of agar is preferably from 9 to 25g/l, more preferably from 12 to<br>
14 g/1, and for the semi-solid media, the amount of agar is preferably from 2 to 6 g/1.<br>
The enzymatic substrates of the invention can be used in a wide pH range, in<br>
particular between pH 5.5 and 10.<br>
The concentration of enzymatic substrate of the invention in the reaction<br>
medium is between 0.01 and 1 g/1, preferably between 0.025 and 0.40g/1, and it is<br>
advantageously 0.05 g/1. This is because, at this substrate concentration, a better<br>
coloration contrast is obtained.<br>
The reaction medium may comprise at least one other substrate specific for an<br>
enzymatic activity other than that detected by the substrate according to the invention.<br>
The enzymatic hydrolysis of the other substrate(s) generates a detectable signal that is<br>
different than the signal detected by the substrate of the invention, for instance different<br>
colored or fluorescent products, so as to allow the demonstration, such as the detection<br>
and/or the identification and/or the quantification, of one or more microorganisms.<br>
By way of other specific substrates, mention may be made of substrates of<br>
indoxyl type, such as 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-(3-D-glucoside (BIOSYNTH) or 5-<br>
bromo-6-chloro-3-indoxyl-p-D-galactoside (BIOSYNTH), or any other substrate used<br>
in the detection of microorganisms.<br>
The concentration of the other specific enzymatic substrate is generally between<br>
0.01 and 2 g/1. Those skilled in the art will be able to readily determine such a<br>
concentration according to the substrate used.<br>
The reaction medium may also comprise one or more elements in combination,<br>
such as amino acids, peptones, carbohydrates, nucleotides, minerals, vitamins,<br>
antibiotics, surfactants, buffers, phosphate salts, ammonium salts, sodium salts or metal<br>
salts. Examples of media are described in the applicant's patent applications EP 656 421<br>
and WO99/09 207.<br>
The enzymatic substrates and reaction media of the invention can therefore be<br>
used in the diagnosis of microorganisms with peptidase activity.<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is also the use of a chromogenic<br>
enzymatic substrate of formula (I), or of a reaction medium as defined above, for<br>
detecting and/or identifying and/or quantifying, in vitro, microorganisms expressing at<br>
least one peptidase activity.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for detecting and/or identifying and/or<br>
quantifying microorganisms expressing at least one peptidase activity, characterized in<br>
that it consists in :<br>
• providing a reaction medium, as defined above,<br>
• inoculating the medium with a biological sample to be tested,<br>
• leaving this to incubate, and<br>
• revealing the presence of at least one peptidase activity alone or in combination with<br>
at least one other enzymatic activity other than this same peptidase activity.<br>
The inoculation and incubation steps are widely known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
For example the incubation temperature is generally between 20 and 55°C, most<br>
commonly between 25 and 45°C, temperatures of 30, 35 and 37°C being the incubation<br>
temperatures most commonly used. As regards the incubation atmosphere, it is<br>
anaerobic or aerobic without distinction.<br>
The developing is carried out by the naked eye by visualization of a change in<br>
coloration that does not diffuse in the reaction medium and is therefore concentrated at<br>
the colonies.<br>
By way of microorganisms that can be diagnosed by virtue of the enzymatic<br>

The substrates of the invention are particularly suitable for the detection of<br>
Gram-negative bacteria because both a microorganism growth and a clear coloration of<br>
the colonies are obtained.<br>
In particular, the chromogenic substrates of the invention in which A is Lalanine<br>
have the advantage that they make it possible to clearly differentiate Gramnegative<br>
bacteria from Gram-positive bacteria.<br>
Thus, another subject of the invention consists of a method for differentiating<br>
bacteria in terms of whether they belong to Gram-positive microorganisms or to Gramnegative<br>
microorganisms, characterized in that it consists in :<br>
• providing a reaction medium, as defined above and in which the substituent A of the<br>
chromogenic substrate is L-alanine,<br>
• inoculating the medium with a biological sample to be tested,<br>
• leaving this to incubate, and<br>
• revealing the presence of at least one color variation synonymous with the presence<br>
of Gram-negative microorganism(s).<br>
The chromogenic substrates of the invention in which A is p-alanine or<br>
pyroglutamine have the advantage that they make it possible to distinguish<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the other genera, and also from the other strains of<br>
Pseudomonas.<br>
Thus, another subject of the invention consists of a method for detecting<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, characterized in that it consists in :<br>
• providing a reaction medium, as defined above and in which the substituent A of the<br>
chromogenic substrate is p-alanine or pyroglutamine,<br>

of Pseudomonas aeruginosa microorganism(s).<br>
The biological samples to be analyzed are any clinical sample, such as a saliva,<br>
blood, urine or stool specimen or any other sample of which the analysis may aid a<br>
clinician in providing a diagnosis. The sample may also be a product derived from, or a<br>
base product of, the food and/or pharmaceutical industry, in which it is necessary either<br>
to guarantee the absence of pathogenic microorganisms, or to count a contaminating<br>
flora, or to detect specific microorganisms.<br>
The invention will be understood more fully from the following examples, given<br>
by way of nonlimiting illustration.<br>
Example 1 ; Synthesis of 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonvl-lj-a\any\)ammo-2-<br>
chloro-l-pentylphenoxazin-3-one and of 7-N-(N'-t-butoxvcarbonyl-Ij-a\an\l)-<br>
amino-1-pentvlphenoxazin -3-one<br>
1,4-Dichlorobenzoquinonediimine was prepared by chlorination of 1.76g<br>
(lOmmol) of p-phenylenediamine, and was dissolved by heating in the presence of<br>
anhydrous methanol (50ml) and 9 g of urea added to the stirred solution. 1.8 g<br>
(lOmmol) of 5-pentylresorcinol was subsequently added to the solution at 40-50°C<br>
and, after complete dissolution, the reaction mixture was brought to reflux carefully in<br>
order to avoid excessive exothermia. The heating was continued for 1.5 h, after which<br>
time the cooled reaction mixture was added slowly to a well-stirred ice/water mixture<br>
containing ammonia. The precipitate was recovered by suction filtration and was<br>
washed with water and then air dried so as to obtain 2.2 g of crude product consisting of<br>
a mixture of the title compounds, the non-chlorinated product being predominant.<br>
Acetic acid (30%, 200 cm3) from a 2-necked flask was added, dropwise, while<br>
stirring, to a solution consisting of approximately 5 g of sodium borohydride and<br>
200 mg of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 200 cm3 of water. Hydrogen gas was passed<br>
through a 3-necked flask in which the mixture of 7-amino-2-chloro-lpentylphenoxazin-<br>
3-one and 7-amino-l-pentylphenoxazin-3-one (0.564 g) was<br>
dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide (15 cm3 by heating and then cooling) and<br>
the solution was diluted with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (15 cm3). A Pd/C<br>
catalyst (5%, 200 mg) was added to the solution. The solution was sparged gently with<br>
hydrogen gas and this was continued for a long time after the apparent reduction<br>
(approximately 1 h). The reduction was demonstrated by the solution turning from a<br>
purple color to a grayish-green color. A solution of resorufamine was thus obtained.<br>
In a separate flask, 0.756 g (4.0 mmol) of N-t-Boc-L-a\anine and 0.408 g<br>
(4.0mmol) of N-methylmorpholine were dissolved in anhydrous THF (10 cm3), the<br>
solution was cooled to -20°C and 0.56 cm3 (4.0 mmol) of isobutyl chloroformate was<br>
added, with stirring. The mixture was stirred at -20°C for a further 30 min, after which<br>
time the mixture was introduced, at -10°C, into the solution of resorufamine with<br>
stirring, while at the same time sparging with hydrogen gas. After 15 min, the<br>
introduction of hydrogen was stopped, the system was sealed and the reaction mixture<br>
was stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered and the<br>
solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, the residual solid was dissolved in<br>
dichloromethane (DCM), the DCM solution was filtered and washed with NaHCCh<br>
(5%, twice 50 cm3) and water (50 cm3). The organic phase was dried with MgS04,<br>
filtered and concentrated so as to obtain a residue consisting of the two title products.<br>
They were purified by silica column chromatography, elution being carried out with a<br>
mixture of petrol and ethyl acetate (7:3). The first spot corresponds to 7-N-(N'-t-<br>
M/oxycar6o«.y/-L-alanyl)amino-2-chloro-l-pentyl-phenoxazin-3-one in the form of an<br>
orange solid and the second spot corresponds to 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycctrbonyl-L-a\ai\y\)-<br>
amino-l-pentylphenoxazin-3-one in the form of a brown solid.<br>

The protocol described in example 1 above was repeated, except that N-t-Boc-$-<br>
alanine was used in place of Nr-Ztoc-L-alanine.<br>
In order to recover the title compounds, silica column chromatography was<br>
performed, elution being carried out with a mixture of petrol/ethyl acetate (6:4). The<br>
first spot corresponds to 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl--a\any\)amino-2-ch\oro-lpentylphenoxazin-<br>
3-one in the form of an orange solid and the second spot corresponds<br>

To do this, the compounds obtained in examples 1 and 2 were dissolved in<br>
2 cm3 of TFA (trifluoroacetate) in the following proportions : 0.10 g (0.21 mmol) for<br>
the 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycctrbonyl-L-a\any\)amino-2-ch\oro-1 -pentylphenoxazin-3-one and<br>

3-one and 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-$-alany\)ammo-1 -pentylphenoxazin-<br>
3-one.<br>
The mixture was kept at ambient temperature for 15 min. The progression of the<br>
reaction was recorded by thin layer chromatography until no further starting material<br>
was demonstrated. The TFA was evacuated off under vacuum and the residue was<br>
completely washed with ether and dried so as to obtain the various compounds in the<br>
form of a trifluoroacetate salt (brown solid), according to the following yields : 0.095 g<br>
(92%) for the 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-L-a\anyl)ammo-2-ch\oroA-penty\phenoxazm-<br>

In order to recover the title compounds, silica column chromatography was<br>
performed, elution being carried out with a mixture of DCM/MeOH (95:5). The first<br>

1.3 mmol of dihydroxydiaryl ether were dissolved in 5 ml of methanol and Pd/C<br>
5% catalyst (10% weight/weight) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred at ambient temperature in the hydrogenation apparatus under a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere for 4 hours. Silica was added to the flask (in sufficient amount in view of<br>
the residue load to be introduced into the column chromatography) and the mixture was<br>
vigorously stirred for a further 4 hours with free access to the air. At the end of the<br>
oxidation, the solvent was removed and the residue was subjected to column<br>
chromatography using an eluent gradient, starting from a 50:50 mixture of light mineral<br>
spirit (60-80°C):ethyl acetate, then changing to a 25:75 mixture then a 0:100 mixture of<br>

DMF in a small round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirrer bar, and 0.010 g of<br>
Pd/C 5% catalyst was added to the solution. The flask was placed in a hydrogenation<br>
apparatus at ambient temperature and a hydrogen atmosphere was maintained while<br>
stirring the reaction mixture for 1 hour. It was possible to confirm complete reduction<br>
by virtue of the fact that the solution changed color from deep purple to grayish-green.<br>

content of the second flask was introduced into the first flask (which contained the<br>
reduced form of the 7-aminophenoxazin-3-one) by means of a syringe under an inert<br>
atmosphere. The presence of oxygen from the air was avoided due to the very rapid<br>
oxidation of the reactant. The mixture was stirred for a further 20 hours at ambient<br>
temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and the solvent was<br>
evaporated off. The residue was redissolved in 20 ml of ethyl acetate, and the organic<br>
layer was washed with 20 ml of 1M HC1, 20 ml of 10% Na2CO3 and 20 ml of water.<br>
The product was dried over MgSCO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure so<br>
as to obtain a residue that was purified by column chromatography using a 30:70<br>
mixture of light mineral spirit (60-80°C):ethyl acetate as eluent.<br>

dissolved in 3 ml of anhydrous DCM and 1 ml of TFA was added to the solution. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature until the end of the reaction<br>
(followed by thin layer chromatography). The solvent and the excess TFA were<br>
evaporated off under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by short column<br>
chromatography using an eluent gradient, starting from a 50:50 mixture of light mineral<br>
spirit (60-80°C):ethyl acetate, then changing to a 0:100 mixture of the same solvents.<br>
Finally, a 90:10 mixture of ethyl acetate:methanol was used as eluent.<br>

trimethylphenoxazin-3-one. The title product was obtained in the form of a red solid<br>
(0.080 g, 96%).<br>
Example 6 : Preparation of methyl 7-JV-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-P-alanyl)amino-lmethvl-<br>
2-chlorophenoxazin-3-one-4-carboxyIate<br>
1.76 g (10 mmol) of 1,4-dichlorobenzoquinoneimine were dissolved in 50 ml of<br>
absolute ethanol with gentle stirring. 1.82 g (10 mmol) of methyl 4-methyl-2,6-<br>
dihydroxybenzoate were added to this stirred solution. The stirred solution was gently<br>
refluxed until the point where a considerable exothermia became apparent, requiring the<br>
flask to be removed from the heat source. After the exothermia had decreased, the<br>
reaction mixture was brought to reflux for a further 30 minutes and allowed to cool to<br>
ambient temperature. After having left the reaction mixture at ambient temperature for<br>
a further 3 hours, the solid product was recovered by suction filtration and washed with<br>
a small amount of hot water followed by suctioning so as to obtain it in as dry a state as<br>
possible, before drying in a desiccator under vacuum. The residue was subjected to<br>
silica gel thin layer chromatography with ethyl acetate as the mobile phase. A<br>
considerable amount of dark-colored base product and also the fluorescent pink<br>
component were observed. The solid product was dissolved in ethyl acetate, filtered and<br>
passed through a silica gel cone. The filtrate is essentially devoid of base product. The<br>
solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the solid product was isolated.<br>
The solid product was subjected to an aminoacylation using f-50C-(3-alanine, as<br>

7.7. Synthesis of the title compound<br>
The title compound can be obtained as indicated in points 5.5. to 5.7. above.<br>
Example 8 ; Detection of the L-alanine peptidase activity of Gram-negative<br>
bacteria<br>
The compounds, chlorinated or nonchlorinated, prepared in example 1, i.e. 7-N-<br>
(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-L-a\any\)ammo-2-ch\oro-l-penly\phenoxazm-3-one (chlorinated<br>
L-alanyl compound) and 7-N-(N"-t-butoxycarbonyl-L-a\any\)amino-}-<br>
pentylphenoxazin-3-one (nonchlorinated L-alanyl compound), which were deprotected<br>
according to the protocol described in example 3, were used.<br>
10 mg of each of the L-alanyl compounds were dissolved in 1 ml of<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, and the mixture was added to 200 ml of molten Columbia agar at<br>
50°C. The medium thus constituted was dispensed into Petri dishes (final concentration<br>
of each substrate : 50.mg/l).<br>
Strains from international collections or derived from the applicant's collection<br>
were then inoculated, using a 10 ul calibrated loop, onto each medium, using calibrated<br>
suspensions of 0.5 McFarland. All the strains were also inoculated onto Columbia agar<br>
media without chromogenic substrate, as a growth control. All the cultures were<br>
incubated for 24 to 48 h at 37°C.<br>
The growth and coloration results obtained between 24 and 48 h of incubation<br>
are given in table 1, in which G signifies growth, C signifies color, I signifies colorless,<br>
the sign ++ signifies very good growth, the sign + signifies good growth of the strain,<br>
the sign +/- signifies average growth of the strain and the sign - signifies absence of<br>
growth of the strain.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results in table 1 above show that the enzymatic substrate of the invention<br>
makes it possible to detect all the bacterial strains since they all grow, but a<br>
modification of coloration is observed only for the Gram - strains (strains 1 to 4 and 6<br>
to 7), which also makes it possible to discriminate between the Gram- strains and the<br>
Gram+ strains.<br>
Example 9 ; Detection of the B-alanine peptidase activity of bacteria of the<br>
Pseudomonas aerueinosa genus<br>
To do this, the chlorinated or nonchlorinated p-alanine compounds prepared in<br>
example 2, i.e. 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-fi-a\anyl)amino-2-ch\oroA-pQntylphenoxazm-<br>
3-one (chlorinated beta-alanyl compound) and l-~N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-$-<br>
alanyl)amino-l-pentylphenoxazin-3-one (nonchlorinated beta-alanyl compound), which<br>
were deprotected according to the protocol described in example 5, were used.<br>
In addition, the Petri dishes were prepared and the strains were inoculated<br>
according to the protocol described in example 5.<br>
The coloration results between 24 and 48 h of incubation are indicated in table 2<br>
below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results in table 2 above demonstrate that the compounds of the invention<br>
make it possible to preferentially detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria<br>
(development of a pale purple to purple coloration).<br>
Example 10 ; Detection of pyroglutamvl peptidase activity<br>
To do this, the chlorinated or nonchlorinated pyroglutamyl compounds prepared<br>
in example 4, i.e. 7-N-(L-pyroglutamyl)amino-2-chloro-l-pentylphenoxazin-3-one<br>
(chlorinated L-pyroglutamyl compound) and 7-N-(L-pyroglutamyl)amino-lpentylphenoxazin-<br>
3-one (nonchlorinated L-pyroglutamyl compound), which were<br>
deprotected according to the protocol described in example 5, were used.<br>
In addition, the Petri dishes were prepared and the strains were inoculated<br>
according to the protocol described in example 5.<br>
The coloration results between 24 and 48 h of incubation are indicated in table 3<br>
below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results in table 3 above demonstrate that the compounds of the invention<br>
make it possible to preferentially detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria.<br>
Example 11 : Detection of the P-alanine peptidase activity of bacteria of the<br>
Pseudomonas aerusinosa genus<br>
To do this, the p-alanine compounds prepared in examples 5 and 6, i.e. 7-N-(N'-<br>
t-butoxycarbonyl-p-alanyl)amino-1,2-dimethylphenoxazin-3-one (b-ala-DMP), 7-A^-<br>
(7V'-6wtoxycar6o«'/-p-alanyl)amino-l,2,4-trimethylphenoxazin-3-one (b-ala-TMP)<br>
and 7-N-(N'-t-butoxycarbonyl-p-a\any\)ammo-1 -methyl-2-chloro-4-(oxo-1 -<br>
methyl)phenoxazin-3-one (b-ala-MCMP), which were deprotected as described in the<br>
previous examples, were used.<br>
In addition, the Petri dishes were prepared and the strains were inoculated<br>
according to the protocol described in example 7. The coloration results between 24<br>
and 48 h of incubation are indicated in table 4 below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results in table 4 above demonstrate<br>
make it possible to preferentially detect<br>
that the compounds of the invention<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria<br>
 (development of a pink-to-violet coloration). It may also be noted that the results can<br>
vary in terms of color and color strength, just as they can in terms of sensitivity and<br>
specificity in relation to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa species, according to the<br>
substituents used and their position on the main ring, such that the use of these various<br>
substrates can be envisioned in different specific applications depending on the<br>
intended objective.<br><br><br><br><br>
