				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of a multi-layer multi-wall sheet and a multi-layer wall sheet.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of gussetless multi-wall sheets coated by coextrusion, to special extrusion dies for the production of such sheets, to their use for the production of such sheets, to multi-layer coextruded multi-wall sheets comprising at least one layer containing a thermoplastic and at least one coating, without the triangle effect, and to other products containing this multi-layer multi-wall sheet.<br>
Multi-wall sheets are often provided on one or both of the outer sides with a coextruded layer capable of performing different functions. For example, it can be a UV protective layer for protecting the sheet from damage (e.g. yellowing) by UV radiation, but other functions, e.g. IR reflection, are also performed in this way.<br>
The state of the art relating to such multi-wall sheets is summarized below.<br>
EP-A 0 110 221 discloses sheets consisting of two layers of polycarbonate, one layer containing at least 3 wt.% of a UV absorber. These sheets can be produced by coextrusion according to EP-A 0 110 221.<br>
EP-A 0 320 632 discloses mouldings consisting of two layers of thermoplastic, preferably polycarbonate, one layer containing special substituted benzotriazoles as UV absorbers. EP-A 0 320 632 also discloses the production of these mouldings by coextrusion.<br>
EP-A 0 247 480 discloses multi-layer sheets in which there is a layer of branched polycarbonate as well as a layer of thermoplastic, the polycarbonate layer containing special substituted benzotriazoles as UV absorbers. The production of these sheets by coextrusion is also disclosed.<br>
EP-A 0 500 496 discloses polymer compositions stabilized against UV light with special triazines, and their use as the outer layer in multi-layer systems. The polymers mentioned are polycarbonate, polyester, polyamides, polyacetals, polyphenylene oxide and polyphenylene sulfide.<br>
However, all the coated multi-wall sheets known from the state of the art exhibit the problem of the so-called "triangle effect", i.e. the coextrusion process gives rise to gussets consisting of the material of the coextraded layer, coupled with a certain unevenness of the sheet surface.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram of a section through a multi-wall sheet, showing how these gussets are formed. The arrows show the flow of the polymer melt in the multi-wall mould of the multi-wall sheet (1) that causes gusset formation in the coextruded layer (2).<br>
Given the state of the art, the object is therefore to produce a multi-wall sheet optionally coated with several layers by coextrusion, which, in contrast to the state of the art, no longer exhibits the triangle effect.<br>
This object forms the basis of the present invention.<br>
In the case of sheets coated on one side, this problem could be solved with a modified feed of the coextrusion material by increasing the material feed from the uncoated side, making it possible to avoid gusset formation on the coated side.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram of a section through a multi-wall sheet, showing how this process could work:<br>
An increased polymer flow from the uncoated side allows a distribution of the melt in the direction of the coated side of the multi-wall sheet (3) such that the coextruded layer (4) remains gussetless.<br>
In the case of sheets coated on both sides, however, this process would no longer work. Here, for example, the increased feed from the bottom side would produce a thicker gusset on the bottom side, so the gain on one side would be offset by a loss on the other side.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram of a section through a multi-wall sheet, showing what this effect would look like (feed at (5)): While the top coextruded layer (6) remains gussetless, the bottom coextruded layer (7) has a thick gusset.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the gusset formation or triangle effect on each side can be virtually completely avoided by modifying the material flows during extrusion in such a way that a partial flow is tapped from the conventional material flow around the die comb, said partial flow being fed directly into the multi-wall mould of the die that forms the walls of the sheets. The material flow through the comb is normally divided into an upper and a lower stream which flow together at the multi-wall moulds, from above and below, to produce the walls. However, this flowing of material from the upper and lower streams creates a typical "draining funnel", which is filled on the coextrusion side with coextrusion material flowing in afterwards. A gusset is formed, as shown in Fig. 1. To enable part of the material to be fed directly into the multi-wall moulds, according to the invention, the material flow from the upper and lower streams is reduced or even prevented, as shown in Fig. 4, and the funnel formation and hence the gusset formation or triangle effect is minimized, or preferably even completely avoided, on both sides of the sheet. The process according to the invention is therefore suitable for the production of multi-wall sheets coated on one or both sides.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram of a section through a multi-wall sheet, showing how the process according to the invention works:<br>
Both coextruded layers (9) and (10) remain gussetless due to an additional feed of polymer melt at (8), for example through a channel into the multi-wall mould.<br>
It is totally surprising that a problem which had existed for so long could be solved so successfully by such a simple measure.<br>
The present invention thus provides a special process for the production of coatings on multi-wall sheets by coextrusion, and the gussetless sheets, or sheets free of the triangle effect, obtainable by this process. These sheets are distinguished by a particularly smooth surface and uniform, i.e. gussetless, coextruded layers. A multi-wall sheet coated on both sides is a preferred embodiment.<br>
This patent application therefore also provides a special extrusion die for carrying out the process according to the invention.<br>
hi addition to the conventional channels, sections and moulds required for various purposes, the die comb contains channels which feed part of the inflowing material directly into the multi-wall mould. In a preferred embodiment, the material is fed directly forwards into the multi-wall mould from a region at the back of the die.<br>
A diagram of a possible embodiment of the die according to the invention, at a multi-wall mould, is shown as a cross-section in Figure 5:<br>
The polymer melt flows in at (12). The melt is fed into the multi-wall mould (14) through the channels (13). (15) denotes the top side or bottom side mould. The sheet exits at (16).<br>
The present invention also provides a product containing said sheets. This product, which contains e.g. said multi-layer multi-wall sheet, is preferably selected from the group comprising glazing, greenhouses, winter gardens, verandas, car ports, bus shelters, canopies, partitions, cash kiosks and solar collectors.<br>
The process according to the invention has the substantial advantage of avoiding the triangle effect, which otherwise has noticeable adverse consequences due to gusset<br>
formation and the associated wastage of material, and by an uneven sheet surface. The coating material wasted in the gusset generally consists of valuable thermoplastic containing expensive additives. It can be of considerable financial advantage to save such material.<br>
The process according to the invention is suitable for the production of a very wide variety of coextruded layers and mainly for any conceivable functional layers, including in combination (UV protection and functional layer, e.g. IR reflection on the top and UV protection on the bottom), and is particularly suitable for the production of multi-wall sheets provided with UV protection on both sides.<br>
The multi-layer products according to the invention, such as multi-wall sheets, have further advantages over the state of the art. The multi-layer products according to the invention, such as the multi-wall sheet, can be produced by coextrusion, affording advantages over a product produced by lacquering. Thus, in contrast to lacquering, no solvents volatilize during coextrusion.<br>
Moreover, lacquers cannot be stored for long periods. Coextrusion does not have this disadvantage.<br>
Also, lacquers demand expensive technology. For example, they require explosion-proof machines and solvent recycling, i.e. high investment in plants. Coextrusion does not have this disadvantage.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is said multi-layer multi-wall sheet wherein the base layer and the coextruded layer can be made of identical or different thermoplastics. Preferably, both layers are based on the same material.<br>
Suitable thermoplastic moulding compounds are any moulding compounds containing e.g. polycarbonate and/or polyester and/or polyestercarbonates and/or polyesters and/or polymethyl methacrylates and/or polystyrenes and/or SAN and/or<br>
blends of polycarbonate and polyesters and/or polymethyl methacrylates and/or polystyrenes and/or SAN.<br>
Preferred moulding compounds are those containing transparent thermoplastics such as polycarbonate and/or polyester, as well as blends containing at least one of the two thermoplastics. It is particularly preferable to use polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylates and very particularly preferable to use polycarbonate.<br>
The preparation of these thermoplastics is well known to those skilled in the art and is carried out by the known processes.<br>
According to the invention, the preferred multi-layer products are those in which the coextruded layer additionally contains 1 to 20 wt.% of UV absorbers and has a thickness of 5 to 200 jam, preferably 30 to 100 µm.<br>
The multi-wall sheets can be twin-wall sheets, triple-wall sheets, quadruple-wall sheets, etc. The multi-wall sheets can also have different profiles, e.g. X profiles or XX profiles. The multi-wall sheets can also be corrugated.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a multi-wall sheet with coextruded layers on both sides, the base material and the two coextruded layers being made of polycarbonate.<br>
Depending on the type of thermoplastics used and the additives they contain, the multi-layer products according to the invention can be translucent, opaque or transparent.<br>
Li one particular embodiment, the multi-layer products are transparent.<br>
Both the base material and the coextruded layer(s) of the multi-layer multi-wall sheets according to the invention can contain additives.<br>
In particular, the coextruded layer can contain UV absorbers and demoulding agents.<br>
The UV absorbers or mixtures thereof are present in concentrations of 0-20 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 20 wt.%, particularly preferably 2 to 10 wt.% and very particularly preferably 3 to 8 wt.%. If two or more coextruded layers are present, the proportion of UV absorbers in these layers can differ.<br>

Examples of antistatic agents are cationic compounds, e.g. quaternary ammonium, phosphonium or sulfonium salts, anionic compounds, e.g. alkylsulfonates, alkylsulfates, alkylphosphates or carboxylates in the form of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, and non-ionic compounds, e.g. polyethylene glycol esters, polyethylene glycol ethers, fatty acid esters or ethoxylated fatty amines. Preferred antistatic agents are non-ionic compounds.<br>
These antistatic agents can be present both in the base layer and in the coextraded layer(s). Different additives or concentrations can be present in each layer. The antistatic agents are preferably used in the coextruded layer(s).<br>
The multi-wall sheets according to the invention can contain organic dyes, inorganic coloured pigments, fluorescent dyes and, particularly preferably, optical brighteners.<br>
These colorants can be present both in the base layer and in the coextruded layer(s). Different additives or concentrations can be present in each layer.<br>
All the moulding compounds and their additives and solvents used to produce the multi-wall sheet according to the invention can be contaminated with respective impurities as a result of their preparative processes and storage, the aim being to work with the cleanest possible starting materials.<br>
The individual constituents can be mixed in known manner, either successively or simultaneously, either at room temperature or at elevated temperature.<br>
The additives, especially the UV absorbers and other additives mentioned above, are preferably incorporated in known manner into the moulding compounds for the multi-wall sheets according to the invention, by mixing polymer granules with the additives at temperatures of about 200 to 330°C in conventional machines, such as internal kneaders, single-screw extruders and double-shaft extruders, for example by melt compounding or melt extrusion, or by mixing solutions of the polymer with solutions of the additives and subsequently vaporizing the solvents in known manner. The proportion of additives in the moulding compound can vary within wide limits and depends on the desired properties of the moulding compound. The total proportion of additives in the moulding compound is preferably up to about 20 wt.%, preferably 0.2 to 12 wt.%, based on the weight of the moulding compound.<br>
The UV absorbers can also be incorporated into the moulding compounds e.g. by mixing solutions of the UV absorbers, and optionally other additives mentioned above, with solutions of the plastics in suitable organic solvents such as CEbCk, halogenoalkanes, halogenoaromatics, chlorobenzene and xylenes. The mixtures of substances are then preferably homogenized in known manner via extrusion; the mixtures of solutions are preferably removed, for example compounded, in known manner by vaporization of the solvent followed by extrusion.<br>
It is possible to work the multi-wall sheets according to the invention e.g. by deep drawing or by means of surface treatments, such as the application of scratch resistant lacquers, water spreading layers, and the like, and the products produced by these processes are also provided by the present invention.<br>
Coextrusion as such is known in the literature (cf. for example EP-A 0 110 221 and EP-AO 110238). In the present case the procedure is preferably as follows: Extruders for producing the core layer and covering layer(s) are connected to a coextrusion adapter. The adapter is constructed so that the melt forming the covering layer(s) is applied as a thin layer adhering to the melt for the core layer. The multi-layer melt strand produced in this way is then converted to the desired shape (multi-wall sheet) in the die connected downstream. The melt is subsequently cooled under controlled conditions in known manner by means of vacuum sizing (multi-wall sheet) and then cut into lengths. Optionally, an annealing furnace can be used after sizing in order to remove stresses, hi place of the adapter arranged upstream from the die, it is also possible for the die itself to be designed so that the melts are brought together at that point.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the illustrated process is carried out using a die modified as described above, i.e. with a channel for feeding the material directly into the multi-wall mould. Accordingly, the present patent application also provides the use of a die according to the invention for the production of a gussetless coated multi-wall sheet.<br>
The invention is illustrated in greater detail by the following Examples, which do not imply a limitation. The Examples according to the invention merely represent preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The machines and equipment used for the production of multi-layer solid sheets are described below. They comprise:<br>
-	the main extruder with a screw of length 25 to 36 D and a diameter of 70 mm<br>
to 200 mm, with and without venting,<br>
-	one or more coextruders for applying the covering layers, with a screw of<br>
length 25 to 36 D, D being the diameter of the extruder, and a diameter D of<br>
25 mm to 70 mm, with and without venting,<br>
-	a coextrusion adapter,<br>
-	a special multi-wall sheet die,<br>
-	a sizer,<br>
-	a take-off device,<br>
-	a roller conveyor,<br>
-	a cutting device (saw),<br>
-	a delivery table.<br>
'he polycarbonate granules of the base material were fed into the hopper of the main xtruder and the coextrusion material was fed into the hopper of the coextruder. each material was melted and conveyed in its own cylinder/screw plasticizing ystem. Both material melts were brought together in the coextrusion adapter and ne multi-wall sheet die and formed a composite after leaving the die and cooling in ne sizer. The other devices served to transport the extruded sheets, cut them into engths and deliver them.<br>
he sheets obtained were then assessed visually.<br>
olycarbonate multi-wall sheets of the following dimensions were produced:<br>
vin-wall sheet 10 mm thick, 11 mm wall separation, 2100 mm wide, 1.7 kg/m2<br>
N2 10/11-2100 1.7 kg/m2<br>
vin-wall sheet 10 mm thick, 11 mm wall separation, 2100 mm wide, 2.0 kg/m2<br>
S2 10/11-2100 2.0 kg/m2<br>
vin-wall sheet 8 mm thick, 11 mm wall separation, 2100 mm wide, 1.5 kg/m2<br>
N2 8/11-2100 1.5 kg/m2<br>
twin-wall sheet 8 mm thick, 11 mm wall separation, 2100 mm wide, 1.7 kg/m2 SS2 8/11-2100 1.7 kg/m2<br>
They contained no obvious gussets and accordingly did not exhibit the triangle effect.<br>
The   following  polycarbonates   were   used   as   coextrusion  materials   in  these experiments:<br>
-	Makrolon® 1243, a branched bisphenol A polycarbonate containing 0.3 mol%<br>
of isatin biscresol as branching agent and having a Mw of 29,234 and a relative solution viscosity of 0.5 g/100 ml, and<br>
-	Makrolon® 3103, a linear bisphenol A polycarbonate having a Mw of 31,887<br>
and a relative solution viscosity of 0.5 g/100 ml,<br>
as base materials, and<br>
-	DP1-1816, another linear bisphenol A polycarbonate having a Mw of 33,560<br>
and containing UV stabilizing additives.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
