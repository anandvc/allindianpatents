				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a single step hydrolytic process for the conversion of lignocellulose into value added chemicals. More particularly, the present invention relates to a single step hydrolytic process for the conversion of a non-edible source such as hemicellulose to value added chemicals such as arabinose and xylose catalyzed by a heterogenous catalyst.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Lignocelluloses are available in plentiful and is a renewable resource made up of ca. 40-50% cellulose, 25-30% hemicellulose and 20-25% lignin. Technologies are in place to separate cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from each other and hence raw material, hemicellulose is readily available.<br>
Hemicellulose a carbohydrate is abundantly and cheaply available across the globe and is a main factor that many countries will be independent about their chemical needs. Hemicellulose, which is basically derived from the non-edible source, will have advantage over edible sources for their conversion into chemicals as it is independent of food-crisis and geo-political factors.<br>
Conversion of fossil feedstock (crude oil, natural gas, coal etc.) into chemicals and energy produces significant amount of carbon dioxide which causes global wanning. The recent exponential price rise of crude oil on the back-drop of mismatch in increasing demand and limited supply has pushed the world economy to a jinx. Moreover, geo-political factors and finite reserves available in only selective areas on the earth are also held responsible for the current situation. To maintain the prices of fuels and to keep carbon dioxide at constant levels, efforts are being made in the field of production of biomass based fuels (bio-ethanol and bio-diesel) and this in turn has made the whole situation more complex. As these fuels are mostly sought from the increasing uses of edible sources such as starch (corn, rice etc.) and vegetable oils (seed oils), it has attracted a lot of criticism across the globe on the note of increasing food prices. Thus, ways to overcome limitations arising from the use of fossil feedstock and edible sources for the synthesis of chemicals are being sought by way of the utilization of non-edible biomass resource under the bio-refinery title. Biomass during its growth captures light energy, water and carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates in a photosynthesis process. The integral part of fixing of C02 during carbohydrate synthesis makes the utilization of plant derived biomass a totally "carbon neutral" process. The net annual yield of photosynthesis is around 1.3 trillion tons, thus making it the largest renewable resource available and a part of this renewable, non-edible resources are lignocellulosic materials such as wood and agricultural wastes.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
While, the main component of wood is cellulose, which constitutes almost 40-50% of wood material, the other major constituent (ca. 25-30%) of wood and second largest renewable feedstock derived from plant is hemicellulose. Cellulose is made up of C6 (hexoses) glucose units and is a highly crystalline material. On the other hand hemicelluloses are complex heterogeneous polymers composed of largely C5 (D-pentoses) and C6 (D-hexoses) monosaccharides such as, Xylose, Mannose, Arabinose, Glucose, Galactose, Glucuronic Acid Uronic Acid etc. depending on the source, as disclosed in the figure herein below. The softwood hemicellulose mainly consists of Xylose, Arabinose, Mannose, Galactose, Glucuronic Acid etc. and hardwood hemicellulose are mainly made up of Xylose and Glucuronic Acid. Concluding from the above discussion, there are 4 major factors, namely food security, cost efficiency, climate change and localized industry independent of geopolitical scenarios, which are driving the global research community to work on non-edible renewable sources for chemical and fuel production.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
structure of hemicellulose<br>
To convert lignocellulosic material (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) into chemicals and fuels, these polysaccharides must be selectively decomposed into corresponding monosaccharides. Currently, lot of research is devoted to the hydrolysis (or decomposition) of the lignocellulosic materials into value-added chemicals. The known technologies for biomass hydrolysis include, dilute acid hydrolysis, concentrated acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis. In the hydrolysis process, in the presence of excess water, the ketal function of the polysccharides can be hydrolyzed to form hemi-acetals and this could liberate monomer form of sugars via oligomer formation. Being water insoluble, hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose is a difficult task and hence requires specific reaction conditions.<br>
Acid hydrolysis (either dilute or concentrated HCl, H2S04) of hemicellulose is known for quite a long time but due to difficulty in inhibition of xylose degradation, corrosion hazard, problems in handling and, storage of acids and generation of neutralization waste, its industrial use is hampered. In the older times, concentrated inorganic acids (H2S04) under milder conditions (100-l50°C) were used, but the recovery of acids was very difficult and was expensive. To overcome this, later dilute acid pathway was established, but required severe conditions such as 150-200°C and positive pressure.<br><br>
The other widely studied method for hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials is enzyme catalyzed reactions. For hydrolysis of hemicellulose, mixture of endo-, exo-Xylanase and 0-Xylosidase is used additionally with a-Arabinofuranosidase and some other enzymes. The enzymatic hydrolysis which is very specific towards product formation is normally done at lower temperatures (50-80°C) but at definite pH (acidic). The known drawbacks of this method are low activity, use of buffers to maintain a specific pH at which enzymes work and make the system corrosive and high cost of enzymes that hampers cost efficiency and also, product-enzyme separation is difficult as both product and catalyst are water soluble.<br>
Thermochemically (&gt;700°C) also, degradation of ligoncellulosic materials is possible. In the gasification process, lignocellulosic material is decomposed at high temperatures under restricted oxygen to give valuable syngas (CO + H2). Several such processes are known. In the pyrolysis method, without oxygen lignocellulosic material is heated at high temperatures to yield mixture of oils, tar and char. In these processes it is difficult to obtain high selectivity for any one compound due to very high temperatures employed under which normal sugars are unstable and undergo further decompositions. The other drawback is formation of char, tar and oils. These compounds don't have much market value due to their complex structures and thus might be considered as a waste. Lastly these methods require very high energy input and so are not cost-effective.<br>
Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials using hot-compressed water (sub and supercritical waters) is also reported. In this technique in the absence of catalyst at 200-3 80°C and about 22 MPa, lignocellulosic material is subjected to critical water condition for short period of time to form hydrolysis products. Lack of high selectivity for any product due to further reaction (towards decomposition) and requirement of high energy input restricts its use. Additionally, under these conditions, water becomes super acidic and hence can corrode the reactor material which increases the capital cost of the whole process.<br>
A research paper published in Energy and Fuels 2005, titled, "Plug-Flow reactor for continuous hydrolysis of Glucans and Xylans from pretreated corn fiber" by Young Mi Kim, Nathan Mosier, Rick Hendrickson and Michael R. Ladisch; Vol. 19, pages 2189-2200 discloses the use of solid strong acid catalyst in the form of solid ion-exchange resins (Amberlyst 35W resin micro reticular type; Dowex 50WX2, SK104, SKI 10 gel type) packed in fixed-beds at 130°C for continuous hydrolysis of soluble Glucans and Xylans. It is also disclosed that first insoluble hemicelluloses is under 160°C, and pH 4-7 is converted into soluble form (oligosaccharides) and then these disslolved oligosaccharides are separated out by centrifugation and are further exposed to ion-exchange resins. The reaction is a two step process.<br>

Further, EP0329923 discloses production of polyhydric alcohol from polysaccharide (starch) using metal supported over silica-alumina or solid acidic catalyst from the group of acidic zeolite (Faujasite type zeolite, HZSM-5, H-Beta, H-Modernite).<br>
US4075406 titled "Process for making Xylose" describes a method for recovering xylose from pentosan, preferably Xylan-containing raw materials including the steps of sulfuric acid hydrolysis of the raw material, purifying the hydrolysate by ion exclusion and color removal and then subjecting the purified solution to chromatographic fractionation on an ion exchange resin column to provide a solution containing a high level of Xylose.<br>
Taking clue from the above discussed technologies and their limitations, study on hemicellulose hydrolysis catalyzed by solid acids was taken up. The major advantages of using solid acids being, ease of separation of catalyst (solid) and product (water soluble) by simple filtration and working under neutral conditions without any corrosion (as acid sites are bound to solid and are not liberated out in the reaction media) in a totally green environment (as no neutralization waste would be generated and water is used as a reaction media). None of the prior art disclosed above teaches or explains a cost-effective, anti-corrosive, one-pot reaction of hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Objects of the invention:<br>

Besides xylose formation, oligomers such as, xylopentaose (5 units of xylose linked with each other), xylotriose (3 units of xylose linked with each other) and xylobiose (2 units of xylose linked with each other) are also obtained with yields of 6, 10 and 14%, respectively. Without catalyst only 50% xylopentaose and 10% xylotetraose (4 units of xylose linked with each other) yield is observed and no xylose formation was possible. This clearly emphasize the fact that the hemicellulose hydrolysis reaction is a catalytic reaction i.e. reaction requires acid catalyst. The formation of glucose is not observed because of overlapping of glucose and xylose peaks in the analysis. However, calculations for xylose formation are based on combined area (glucose+xylose) and total xylose and glucose present in the substrate (i.e. in model substrate of oat spelt, &gt;70% xylose and 
As seen in Figure 2, it is observed that during the course of the reaction, first hemicellulose is thermally decomposed to oligomers, which in turn are converted further into<br><br>
monomer (xylose). It is also interesting to note that, after activation of the HUSY (Si/Al=15) catalyst, xylose yield (40%) increases compared with non-activated catalyst (26%). Arabinose formation was also seen with yield of ca. 70%. Formation of furaldehyde derived from the dehydrocyclization of xylose and/or arabinose was also observed with yield of 14% on S042" /Zr02 catalyst.<br>
The effect of temperature on the catalytic reaction of instant invention is seen in Figure 3. It is clearly seen that the reaction is very much dependent on temperature. At 100°C, about no xylose formation is observed but as temperature increases from 100 to 200°C, formation of xylose increases with decrease in time. At 120°C, 13% of xylose formation is observed after 72 h reaction time, whereas at 130 and 140°C, 40 and 47% of Xylose formation is observed after 48 and 22 h reaction time, respectively. If temperature is further increased to 150°C, 160°C and 170°C, xylose formation is at, 45, 41, 43% after 10, 6 and 2.5 h time, respectively. Further increase in temperature to 200°C, gave 45% xylose within 30 min of reaction time. It is observed from figure 4 that at 1 atm pressure, after 24 h reaction with HUSY (Si/Al=15) catalyst, 18% xylose is formed. As pressure increased to 5 bar and above, xylose formation almost remains constant (ca. 30-40%).<br>
It is well known that softwood and hardwood derived hemicelluloses have different morphology and that the Degree of Polymerization (DP) i.e. total Xylose units linked with each other to form a polymer are different. In case of softwood hemicellulose, it is reported that DP is approximately 100 while for hardwood hemicellulose it is around 200. This makes the hardwood hemicellulose difficult to degrade or may be the rate of reaction is lower. Considering this, study on hemicellulose source was carried out and results are presented in figure 5. It is observed that almost same xylose formation is possible with any hemicelluloses substrate.<br>
It is observed that with solid acid catalysts hemicellulose is hydrolyzed to monosaccharides such as xylose, glucose, arabinose, mannose, oligomers such as xylopentaose, xylotetraose, xylotriose, xylobiose and is also being further converted into furaldehyde and 5-hydroxymethyl furfuraldehyde (HMF). The xylose derived can be widely used as a raw material for the synthesis of variety of chemicals either chemically or biochemically, xylitol production after hydrogenation of-CHO group from xylose is well reported. Further, xylitol is extensively used in food, pharmaceutical and thin coating applications. The more important use of xylitol is as a sweetener and is used in sugar-free sweets; that can be consumed by diabetic patients. Xylose can also be converted into glycols (ethylene, propylene etc.) and can also act as hydrogen source as shown for sorbitol substrate. The xylose can also be converted into ethanol, 2,3-butanediol, lactic acid and many other chemicals.<br>
The process of the invention has the following advantages over conventional mineral acid (HC1, H2S04) catalyzed and enzyme catalyzed processes:<br><br>
1.	It is a non-corrosive system.<br>
2.	The process does not generate any neutralization waste as system operates at neutral pH due to solid acid catalyst and water is used as a reaction media.<br>
3.	Separation of catalyst and product is easy, as the catalyst is solid and insoluble in reaction media while products (xylose arabinose, glucose, furaldehyde, oligomers etc.) formed are soluble in water. Hence the overall costly process of separation of catalyst from reaction media/product is avoided and just simple filtration step can be employed.<br>
4.	Handling of catalyst is very easy and does not need any special precaution as required for handling mineral acids.<br>
5.	The reaction is industrially applicable.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below with reference to the following examples, which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
