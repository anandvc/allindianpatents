				<td>Description:-<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	The present invention is concerned about the technical sector of vehicles provided for wheels and tyres mounted on them. Vehicles throughout the present application, means all types of vehicles including light vehicles (LVs), such as cars, motor-bikes, scooters, and utility vehicles or heavy vehicles such as lorries, trucks, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), their trailers, civil engineering machinery, forestry vehicles, military vehicles, emergency vehicles and other such vehicles.<br>
2.	The general problem faced by many vehicles is that of accidental pressure loss amounting of running flat after some time due to escape of air and sharp decrease in pressure inside the internal cavity from the designed pressure to zero, resulting in collapsing of the side walls of the tyre in vehicles equipped with tyres.<br>
3.	The causes of such accidental pressure loss are many such as running over a sharp object like nails, hit by bullet, impact on a shape of the "pothole" or the edge of a pavement, deterioration of the valve, damage to the rim etc.<br>
4.	Amongst many methods of combating the above problem of accidental pressure loss one of the solution is using tubeless tyre.<br>
5.	In a tubeless tyre nail puncturing the tyre does not expose any valve hole as though is mostly seen in tyre-tube arrangement. Air escapes only through the actual space punctured by the nail, thus only giving some more time to drive to the workshop.<br>
6.	The unique the Zero Pressure™ tire system is designed to fit on expensive cars like Mercedes, BMW, and Honda Accord. The Zero Pressure™ tire will allow one to drive up to 50 miles at 55 mph even after being punctured.<br>
7.	The devices for sealing the puncture are based on so-called "sealing products" whose function is to block the hole giving rise to perforation of the tire. These products can be effective for holes of limited size, but these efficacy decreases rapidly over time and the presence of these products in the tires greatly complicates<br>
their mounting and removal. Again the presence of these products does not eliminate the risk of a user having to stop in the event of puncture.<br>
8.	Another type of sealing product is contained in an aerosol van and is introduced into the internal cavity through the inflation valve and applied against the internal surface of the tire by virtue of the action of a compressed gas present in the aerosol can only after a puncture. The aerosol cans are used by the users themselves hence requires the stoppage of the vehicle, which is an extremely serious drawback for the user. Again these are not effective in particular in certain cases of rapid puncture that is to say in case where a large perforation has occurred.<br>
9.	Now pressure monitoring system are available in the market which inform the user that one or more of his tires has encountered puncture. Again many devices also measure the temperature of the in the internal air so that the pressure can be corrected according to the law perfect gases.<br>
OlO.Some tyres or mounted wheel assemblies comprise a support disposed around the rim in the internal cavity of the tire. Such a support consists for example of a vulcanized rubber material which are usually reinforced by textile or metallic cable reinforcement. At abnormally low pressure, the interior of the tyre comes into contact with this support and slides over it, so gives rise to heating and mechanical damage due to friction.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example of "PANDA SUPER WHEEL" according to this invention featuring small sacs referred by no.4 and 5, unfeigned integrated supplying system referred by no.2 and 3, tyre referred by no. I, internal cavity of tyre, tube and wheel rim referred by no.6.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
001.Whenever a sharp object such as nail or bullet comes across pneumatic tyre it goes through the tread of the tyre may be it biased or bias chained or radial and punctures the tube, it causes a hole in the tube. Due to high stress the hole opens and starting the loss of air through it. This causes the entire tyre to collapse and tyre runs flat in a very small duration of time.<br>
002.In a tubeless tyre though the tyre does not expose any valve hole and air escapes through the actual space punctured by the nail. That does not mean that running flat is completely avoided; it only gives to air to escape in a longer interval.<br>
3.	The invention "PANDA SUPER WHEEL" concerns in this concept of accidental pressure loss, which constitutes a specially conceptualized, designed and developed internal system;<br>
4.	mounted in the assemblage of tyre and wheel rim or tyre, tube and wheel rim as the case may be, so as to deal with phenomenon of loss of pressure and ultimately flat running.<br>
5.	Person having good knowledge in this field knows the mounted assemblage means the tire mounted on the rim or tyre and tube mounted in the rim and inflated to a certain pressure, known as the service pressure.<br>
6.	The invention proposes a system as described above which is capable of dealing effectively, without stopping the vehicle, and without any external means or aid, both slow (small perforations) and fast (large perforations) pressure loss situations,<br>
7.	for which no satisfactory system was known, with the possibility of preventing flat running, which is very important advantage. All these properties and capabilities are included in the present application and are included in the claims.<br>
8.	Such a combination of performance and advantages has never been achieved or approached in prior art.<br>
009.lt has also been seen that, even when the prior art afforded very partial, isolated and temporary solutions, the efficacy was reduced and was always accompanied by drawbacks which in practice was limited to prior art of impractical theoretical solutions. 0010. Compared to earlier work in this field, a person skilled the art will easily understand that present invention creates a large breakthrough in the wheel and tyre system, as big as the invention of tyre itself.<br>
11.	Specially conceptualized, developed and designed small sacks or theca fulfills the function of combating the menace of deflation of the tyre due accidental pressure loss.<br>
12.	Unfeigned integrated supplying system of compressed air inflates the tyre as shown in fig. 1 by number 1, by assistance of the air compressor<br>
13.	means performs the function of feeding or injecting compressed air into the internal cavity of the tyre and every part thereof<br>
14.	to the desired pressure better known as "service" pressure and does comparison with pressure reference (PR).<br>
15.	"PANDA SUPER WHEEL" technology as described can be implemented in present day technologies such as<br>
16.	in performance tires with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
17.	in snow tires with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
18.	in all season tires with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
19.	in all season performance tires with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
20.	in all two wheeler vehicles with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
21.	in all commercial vehicles with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
22.	in all passenger vehicles with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
23.	in all types of vehicles using tyre or tyre-tube arrangement with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
24.	with sealing objects with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
25.	with tire pressure monitoring (TPM) systems with required changes as may be the condition needed.<br>
26.	with very little difference in its present outer look.<br>
27.	"PANDA SUPER WHEEL" is an integrated system of tyre, internal cavity of tyre, tube (if tube-tyre arrangement is used in the vehicle) and wheel rim as shown in fig. 1 by number 6;<br>
28.	and seeks different design in the internal cavity of the tyre in tubeless tyre for the desired performance apart from other few changes in the integrated system as may be need of the condition.<br>

30.	means the internal part of the tyre in case of tubeless tyre and internal part of the tube in case of tyre and tube system.<br>
