				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing sildenafil.<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/534,527 filed on January 5,2004,60/547,232 filed on February 23,2004 and 60/549,268 filed on March 1,2004, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention encompasses processes for the preparation of sildenafil and the" citrate salt of sildenafil. The invention also encompasses sildenafil citrate water adduct and a method of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising combining the sildaiafil citrate and/or sildenafil citrate water adduct with at least one phaimaceutically-acceptable excipient<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sildenafil citrate is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-sp6cific phophodiesterase type 5 (PDB5), commercially developed by Pfizer, Inc. as VIAGRAÂ®. Sildenafil citrate is designated chemically as l-[[3-(6,7-clihydro-l-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-lH-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyiimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methlypipera2ine citrate, having a molecular weight of 666.7, and the following chemical structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Sildenafil citrate is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a solubility of 3.5 mg/ml in water. The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavemosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing the inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5, which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavemosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.<br>
The synthesis of pvrazolopyrimidinone compounds was described as the reaction of a chlorosulfonyl compound with a cyclic amine. As the reaction progresses, however, mineral acids are produced which may further react with the product or starting materials thereby reducing the overall yield. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,250,534 to Bell et al. generically describes the synthesis of various pyrazolopyrimidinone compounds. A sulfonyl chloride is allowed to react with an excess of cyclic amine at room temperature to yield the desired product. The process, however, uses an excess of the cyclic amine, which can be economically prohibitive depending on the cyclic amine used. Additionally, because the protonated amine compound is similar to the final product, purification is complicated by the difficulty in removing the side-product from the reaction mixture.<br>
The invention is directed to processes for synthesizing sildenafil citrate which reduce the undesired side-products commonly associated with known methods in the art.  The present also provides soluble or easily dissolved sildenafil citrate water adduct for use in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The terms "sildenafil base" and "sildenafil" are used interchangeably herein. The invention encompasses methods of preparing sildenafil base and sildenafil citrate in high yield with little or no purification required. The processes of the invention allow for economical synthesis, shorter reaction times, and higher yields. In addition, the synthesis of sildenafil citrate may be carried out in a one pot synthetic scheme, i.e., sildenafil is prepared and subsequently sildenafil citrate salt is prepared without changing reaction vessels.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention encompasses synthesizing sildenafil comprising combining benzene sulfonyl chloride-3-(4,7-dihydro-l-methyl-7-oxb-3-propyl-lH-pyrazolo(4,3-d)pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxvphenyl) with at most about 1 molar equivalent of N-methyl piperazine, at least one organic solvent, and at least one proton scavenger into a reaction mixture to form sildenafil. Preferably, the N-methyl piperazine is present in an amount of about 1 molar equivalent of the benzene sulfonyl chloride.<br>
In another embodiment, the process for synthesizing sildenafil comprises combining benzene sulfonyl chloride-3-(4,7-dihydro-l-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-lH-pyrazolo(4,3-d)pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl) with N-methyl piperazine, at least one organic solvent, and at least one inorganic proton scavenger into a reaction mixture to form sildenafil. The N-methyl piperazine used hi this process can be present in any amount sufficient for the reaction to proceed. The N-methyl piperazine can be in excess of the benzene sulfonyl chloride, or it can be present in an amount of at most about 1 mol of N-methyl piperazine per mole of the benzene sulfonyl chloride.<br>
When preparing the reaction mixture, the order by which the N-methyl piperazine, proton scavenger, and sulfonyl chloride are added should be taken into consideration. If addition of the N-methyl piperazine or proton scavenger is delayed after sulfonyl chloride is added to the mixture, potential hydrolysis of the chlorosulfonyl derivative to its corresponding acid may result in a poor impurity profile. In a preferred embodiment, the benzene sulfonyl chloride is added to the reaction mixture after the N-methyl piperazine and proton scavenger are added. Example 34 illustrates one preferred embodiment. The benzene sulfonyl chloride may be added all at once, or in separate portions. The benzene sulfonyl chloride can also be added as a solid in addition to acetone slurry form.<br>
Suitable organic solvents for the synthesis of sildenafil include, but are not limited to, at least one of acetone, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dichloromethane, or toluene. Preferably, the organic solvent is at least one of acetone, ethanol, or methanol. Sufficient organic solvent should be added to allow the reaction to proceed, for example, the solvent should be added in an amount of about 5 ml to about 40 ml per gram of sildenafil. Optionally, water may be added to the reaction mixture. If added, water is preferably present in a ratio of about 1:2 water to organic solvent by volume.<br>
The reaction temperature should be sufficient to effect condensation. Typically, the reaction temperature may be from about 0Â°C to about reflux temperature. Preferably, the reaction temperature is about room temperature (25Â°C) to about 40Â°C.<br>
The proton scavenger can be any compound that reacts with protons in solution in a manner to remove the protons from reacting with other chemicals or compounds within the reaction mixture. The proton scavenger can be an organic or inorganic base. Preferred organic proton scavengers include, but are not limited to, at least one of triethylamine, dimethylaminopyridine, or di-tertbutylanUine. Preferred inorganic proton scavengers include, but are not limited to, at least one of NaOH, KOH, NaHCO3, KHCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, or Ca(OH)2. The amount of proton scavenger can be from about 0.8 mol to about 1.5 mol per mol of sildenafil, preferably about 1 mol per mol of sildenafil.<br>
Sildenafil may be isolated by methods commonly known in the art. Generally, the reaction mixture maybe cooled to about 0Â°C, upon which a precipitate appears. The precipitate may then be collected to obtain the isolated product sildenafil. Optionally, sildenafil may be dried while heated and/or under vacuum. For example, sildenafil may be dried at a temperature of about 50Â°C under a vacuum of about 10 mmHg.<br>
The invention also encompasses processes for the synthesis sildenafil citrate comprising synthesizing sildenafil followed by reaction with citric acid to synthesize sildenafil citrate, hi this embodiment, sildenafil may be synthesized and immediately allowed to react with citric acid, i.e. without changing reaction vessels, or sildenafil may be synthesized and/or isolated and then allowed to react with citric acid to form sildenafil citrate. If isolated prior to the synthesis of sildenafil citrate, sildenafil may optionally be purified by any method known in the art.<br>
The synthesis of sildenafil citrate comprises combining into a reaction mixture citric acid with sildenafil. Preferably, the citric acid is present in an amount of about 1 mol equivalent to about 2 mol equivalents of sildenafil, more preferably from about 1 mol equivalent to about 1.5 mol equivalents of sildenafil.<br>
The reaction mixture to form sildenafil citrate may farther comprise at least one organic solvent. The citric acid may be combined with the organic solvent before being added to the sildenafil, or the citric acid maybe added directly into the reaction mixture comprising sildenafil and the organic solvent. Preferably, the organic solvent includes, but is not limited to, at least one of acetone, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl acetate, toluene, heptane, or methylene chloride. More preferably, the organic solvent is acetone. Preferably, the organic solvent is present in an amount of about 2 to about 40 times the volume of the reagents. Optionally, water may be added to the reaction mixture to form the citrate salt. A preferred solvent-water combination is acetone and water. The organic solvent used to form sildenafil citrate can be the same as the organic solvent used in the preparation of sildenafil, or they can be different.<br>
The reagents maybe added as solids and mixed with the solvents, such as a slurry reaction. Alternatively, each reagent may be dissolved in its selected solvent, and the two solutions are then combined. For example, citric acid may be first dissolved in a solution such as acetone, and then added to the sildenafil base solution.<br>
The preferred reaction temperature for sildenafil citrate formation is from about 0Â°C to about 130Â°C, more preferably at about reflux temperature, for example, about 56Â°C for acetone solvent. Depending upon reaction conditions, the reaction may be immediate or can take as long as 24 hours.<br>
The sildenafil citrate may be dried using methods commonly known to one skilled in the art. Typically, the drying methods include heat and/or vacuum. For example, sildenafil citrate may be dried by heating to a temperature of about 50Â°C to about 100Â°C under a vacuum of about 2 mm Hg. The time for drying may vary depending upon variables known to the skilled artisan such as product wetness, temperature, and vacuum.<br>
The sildenafil citrate obtained by'the above method maybe isolated as a wet crystal or as a hydrate wherein the water content is from about 1.2% to about 1.7% as measured by Karl Fischer method.<br>
The invention also encompasses sildenafil citrate water adduct, or sildenafil citl'ate complexed with water. Not to be limited by theory, it is believed that sildenafil citrate complexed with water has increased stability. The sildenafil citrate water adduct of the invention is suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations, having advantages such as good bulk properties and good mixing properties.<br>
Water may be present in the adduct in an amount of about 0.3% to about 2% by weight, preferably in an amount of about 0.5% to about 2% by weight of the sildenafil. More preferably, water is present in the sildenafil citrate adduct in an amount of about 1 % to about 2% by weight, and most preferably, in an amount of about 1.5% to about 1.7%. Alternatively, the water content maybe expressed as a molar ratio. For example, water may be present in a ratio of about 0.1 mol to about 0.8 mol of water per mole of sildenafil citrate. Preferably, the water is present in a ratio of about 0.2 mol to about 0.8 mol of water per mole of sildenafil citrate. The amount of water in sildenafil citrate is easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the skilled artisan can easily determine the amount of water using the standardized Karl Fisher method.<br>
The sildenafil citrate water adduct of the invention may be milled into particles of a particular size or shape to further increase dissolution and solubility. The formation of particles in sizes disclosed herein can be obtained by methods well known in the art (See U.S. Patents Nos. 4,151,273; 4,196,188; 4,302,446; 4,840,799; and 5,271,944). One common technique to decrease particle size is by micronization. Micronization is a mechanical process that involves the application of force  to a particle, thereby resulting hi the break-up of the particle. Such force may be applied by collision of particles at high speeds. Micronization may be carried out, for example, by grinding or by an air-jet micronizer.<br>
Typically, the sildenafil citrate water adduct of the invention has a particle size of less than about 100 microns. Preferably, the particle size is less than about 50 microns, more preferably less than about 20 microns. As used herein, the term "particle size" refers to the maximum size of particles in the sample. For example, a particle size of 100 microns means that all of the sildenafil citrate water adduct particles have a size below that value. The size of a particle is determined by the particle diameter, which may be measured by any of the methods commonly known in the art. The following methods, for example, may be used: sieves, sedimentation, electrozone sensing (coulter counter), microscopy, or Low Angle Laser Light<br>
Scattering (LALLS). The preferred methods for the present invention are the methods most commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry, such as laser diffraction or sieve analysis.<br>
The laser diffraction method used to characterize the particle size distribution<br>
of sildenafil citrate may be for instance Malvern Mastersizer S equipped, with a small<br>
cell dispersion unit with a digital dispersion unit controller. The measurement maybe<br>
done using lens 300RF (0.05-900 microns) and presentation 3OHD. In this case, the<br>
dilution medium used may be Silicon fluid F-10. The sample may be added as a<br>
powder into the measurement cell in small quantities. Generally, the measurement<br>
may be started after 3 minutes of recirculation at speed rate of approximately 3400<br>
Â±10 rpm. Following the accepted rules of Good Manufacture Procedures, the<br>
sildenafil citrate sample is preferably measured after performing a successful blank<br>
measurement (% obscuration no more than (NMT) 0.1 %). Although the laser<br>
diffraction method is exemplified, any other method to determine particle size<br>
distribution accepted in the pharmaceutical industry, like other instruments of laser<br>
dif&amp;action or sieve analysis, may be used with the provision that the re.sult obtained is reasonably accurate, i.e,, within widely accepted industrial standards.	<br>
The sildenafil citrate water adduct is useful for pharmaceutical purposes such as drug formulation. Sildenafil citrate dissolution properties may be further enhanced . by providing sildenafil citrate water adduct having a high surface area. In a preferred embodiment, the sildenafil citrate water adduct has a specific surface area of about 4 m2/g to about 6 m2/g, more preferably about 5 m2/g.<br>
The sildenafil citrate water adduct of the invention has a melting point in the range of about 185Â°C to about 193Â°C. Preferably, the melting point of the water adduct is from about 188Â°C to about 1920Q, more preferably from about 189Â°C to about 191Â°C. Most preferably, the melting point of the water adduct is from about 189Â°C to about 190Â°C. The melting point may be measured using the standard method of melting point described in the USP.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention encompasses sildenafil citrate having a melting point hi the range of from about 185Â°C to about 190Â°C.<br>
The invention further encompasses a method of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising combining the sildenafil citrate and/or the sildenafil citrate water adduct of the invention with at least one pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient.Any excipient commonly known and used widely in the art, such as carriers, fillers, bulking agents, binders, wetting agents, disintegrating agents, surface active agents, lubricants, or diluents can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. For example, carriers include, but are not limited to, lactose, white sugar, sodium chloride, glucose, urea, starch, calcium carbonate, kaolin, crystalline cellulose, and silicic acid. Binders include, but are not limited to, water, ethanol, propanol, simple syrup, glucose solutions, starch solutions, gelatin solutions, carboxymethyl cellulose, shelac, methyl cellulose, potassium phosphate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Disintegrating agents include, but are not limited to, dried starch, sodium alginate, agar powder, laminalia powder, sodium hydrogen carbonate, calcium carbonate, fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, sodium lauryl sulfate, monoglyceride of stearic acid, starch, or lactose.

Tablets can be further coated with commonly known coating materials such as sugar coated tablets, gelatin film coated tablets, tablets coated with enteric coatings, tablets coated with films, double layered tablets, or multi-layered tablets.<br>
Various types of dosage forms can be prepared from the pharmaceutical compositions comprising the sildenafil citrate water adduct, depending on the therapeutic purpose, for example tablets, pills, powders, liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, capsules, injection preparations (solutions and suspensions), or the like. The preferred dosage form is a tablet, preferably a 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet.<br>
When tableting the pharmaceutical composition, any commonly known excipient used in the art can be used. For example, carriers include, but are not limited to, lactose, starch, coconut butter, hardened vegetable oils, kaolin, or talc. Binders include, but are not limited to, gum arabic powder, tragacanth gum powder, gelatin, or ethanol. Disintegrating agents include, but are not limited to, agar, or laminalia.<br>
When preparing injectable pharmaceutical compositions, solutions and suspensions are sterilized and are preferably made isotonic to blood.

For example, carriers for injectable preparations include, but are not limited to, water, ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxylated isostearyl alcohol, or fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan. One of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine with little or no experimentation the amount of sodium chloride, glucose, or glycerin necessary to make the injectable preparation isotonic. Additional ingredients, such as dissolving agents, buffer agents, or analgesic agents may be added. If necessary, coloring agents, preservatives, perfumes, seasoning agents, sweetening agents, or other medicines may also be added.<br>
