				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of hyperbranched polymers and copolymers. More particularly the present "invention relates to a process for the production of hyperbranched polymers from divinylbenzene or 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene in presence or in absence of a co-monomer such as styrene, 1,1-diphenylethylene with broad molecular weight distribution using anionic initiator.<br>
Physical properties of polymers mainly depend on their chemical composition and architectural features. The physical properties can be tailored by manipulation of the polymer's main-chain topology (US Patent 5587441 (1996), Science, 263, 1710, 1994, ACS Symp. Scr. 285, 175, 1985 and J. Am. Chcm. Soc., 117, 6414, 1995). Branching in a linear polymer exerts tremendous influence on chemical, physical, mechanical and Theological properties.<br>
Regular, well-defined branching in a polymer synthesis produces a globular shape three-dimensional topology called dendrimers (J. Org. Chem., 50, 2003, 1985, Angew. Chem., 102, 119, 1990 and Macromolecules, 24, 5893, 1991). However, dendrimers are very difficult to produce as the synthesis involves multi-step reactions. It is also known that a less well-defined hyperbranched polymer can be obtained from condensation of<br><br>
AB2 type monomers (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 74, 2718, 1952). Recently, Frechet and co-workers demonstrated a novel method for the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers using vinyl monomer which has a dormant functional group with the potential of initiating vinyl groups when activated by an external stimulus (US Patent 5587446 (1996), 5635571 (1997), 5663260 (1997), Science, 269, 1080, 1995 and J. Am. Chem. Soc., 117, 10763, 1995). Upon activation of the dormant group in such a vinyl monomer, it initiates<br><br>
intermolecularly and produces hypcrbranched polymer. As the intermolecular reaction of vinyl monomer containing initiating group resembles polycondensation, the process is called as self-condensing vinyl polymerization (SCVP).<br>
Several vinyl monomers such as p-(chloromethyl)styrene (Science, 269, 1080, 1995), 2-((2-bromopropionyl)oxy)ethyl acrylate (US Patent 5763548 (1998), and Macromolecules, 30, 7034, 1995), are used for SCVP. Depending on the nature of monomer, suitable polymerization methods have been adopted for SCVP, i.e., cationic (Science, 269, 1080, 1995), radical (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 117, 10763, 1995), atom transfer radical (Macromolecules, 30, 7034, 1997), and group transfer polymerization (GTP) (Polym. Prepr. (Am. Chem. Soc., Div. Polym. Chem.), 38, 498, 1997 and Macrmol. Rapid Commun., 18, 865, 1997). However, anionic polymerization method has not been yet applied for SCVP. It is possible to synthesis hyperbranched polymer using anionic initiators and divinylbenzene monomers under appropriate condition. Hyperbranched polymers are expected to have non-Newtonian flow in melt as well as in solution viscosity and hence low viscosities can be achieved for a very high molecular weight. Hyperbranched polymeric materials will have important role to play in industry as they are cost effective compare to regular dendritic polymers.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of hyperbranched polymers and copolymers using divinylbenzene monomers with anionic initiators.<br>
Another objective is to produce hyperbranched copolymers using divinylbenzene monomers with other non-acrylic comonomers. Yet another objective is to enable the<br><br>
production of polymers and copolymers with a- wide range of molecular weight with broad molecular weight distribution with polydispersities in the range of 2 to 50.<br>
Still another objective is to enable the production of hyper-brached polymers or<br>
copolymers consisting of chain end functionality, which can be used for further post reactions.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of hyperbranched polymers and copolymers which comprises mixing an equimolar amount of initiator and diisopropenylbenzene or divinylbenzene monomer in less than 2 seconds at 30 °C to -40 °C in an organic solvent, cooling the said mixture to -40 °C to obtain a solution of hyperbranched polymer, optionally adding co-monomer equal to or higher than initiator moles periodically, terminating the said polymer with a small amount of degassed methanol and separating the hyperbranched polymer by conventional precipitation using a non-solvent.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention, the initiator used may be of general formula (I), in the drawing accompanying the specification, where R1 = linear or branched alkyl group having one to six carbon atoms, R2 = hydrogen atom or phenyl or alkyl group having one to six carbon atoms, R3 = hydrogen atom or phenyl or an ester group, and M+ is an alkali or alkaline earth metal such as n-, secondary, or tertiary-butyllithum and 1,1-diphenylhexyllithium.<br>
In another embodiment the monomer used may be such as 1,3-divinylbenzene, 1,4-divinylbenzene, commercial mixture of 1,3 and 1,4-divinylbenzene (with 35% ethylvinylbenzene) (DVB) and 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (DIPB).<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the mole ratio of initiator to monomer can vary from 1:1 to 1:0.4 preferrably 1:1.<br>
In still another embodiment the solvent used for the synthesis of hyper branched polymer may be selected from tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetrahydropyran (THP), or hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and cyclohexane preferably tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In yet another embodiment the non-solvent used for the precipitation may be such as methanol, methanol-water (8:2 v/v) mixture, n-hexane and petroleum ether.<br>
In still another embodiment the comonomer used may be such as styrene or alpha-methylstyrene, isoprene, butadiene, 1,1-diphenylethylene, alkyl (meth)acrylates, and other (alkyl) acrylates.<br>
