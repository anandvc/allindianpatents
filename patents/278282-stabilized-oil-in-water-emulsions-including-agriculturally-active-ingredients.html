FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to stable, agricultural oil-in-water emulsion compositions.<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61/070,743 filed on March 25, 2008, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
Concentrated oil-in water emulsions of liquid active ingredients or active ingredients dissolved in a solvent are commonly used in agricultural compositions due to certain advantages provided over other formulation types. Emulsions are water based, contain little or no solvent, allow mixtures of active ingredients to be combined into a single formulation and are compatible with a wide range of packaging material. However, there are also several disadvantages of such agricultural emulsions, namely that they are often complex formulations which require high amounts of surface-active agents for stabilization, are generally very viscous, have a tendency for Oswald ripening of the emulsion globules and separate over time. Therefore, improvements in such emulsion formulations are needed in the agricultural field.<br>
Several oil-in-water emulsion compositions for cosmetics and dermatological applications have been described in patents U.S. 5,658,575; U.S. 5,925,364; U.S. 5,753,241; U.S. 5,925,341; U.S. 6,066,328; U.S. 6,120,778; U.S.<br>
6,126,948; U.S. 6,689,371; U.S. 6,419,946; U.S. 6,541,018; U.S. 6,335,022; U.S. 6,274,150; U.S. 6,375,960; U.S. 6,464,990; U.S. 6,413,527; U.S. 6,461,625; and 6,902,737; all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. However, although these types of emulsions have found advantageous use in personal care products, these types of emulsions have not been used previously with agriculturally active compounds, which are typically present in emulsions at much higher levels than cosmetic active ingredients.<br>
One example of an agricultural oil-in-water emulsion composition that is suitable for agriculturally active ingredients that are liquid or soluble in suitable solvents at relevant storage temperatures is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/495,228, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The present invention is related to agricultural compositions comprising an oil-in-water emulsion, the oil-in-water emulsion composition having an oil phase and water phase, the oil-in-water emulsion composition comprising an oil adapted to form oily globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers, at least one agriculturally active compound, at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent, at least one ionic surface-active agent, at least one polymeric surface-active agent and water.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a novel oil-in-water emulsion composition having an oil phase and water phase, the oil-in-water emulsion composition comprising:<br>
an oil adapted to form oily globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers;<br>
at least one polymeric surface active agent;<br>
at least one agriculturally active compound;<br>
at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent,<br>
at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent;<br>

water.<br>
The oil phase of the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention utilizes either an agriculturally active compound which is in the form of an oil, or alternatively, an agriculturally active compound dissolved or mixed in an oil, to form the oily globules. An oil is by definition, a liquid which is not miscible with water. Any oil which is compatible with the agriculturally active compound may be used in the oil-in-water emulsions of the present invention. The term 'compatible' means that the oil will dissolve or mix uniformly with me agriculturally active compound and allow for the formation of the oily globules of the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention. Exemplary oils include, but are not limited to short-chain fatty acid triglycerides, silicone oils, petroleum fractions or hydrocarbons such as heavy aromatic naphtha solvents, light aromatic naphtha solvents, hydrotreated light petroleum distillates, paraffinic solvents, mineral oil, alkylbenzenes, paraffinic oils, and the like; vegetable oils such as soy oil, rape seed oil, coconut oil, cotton seed oil, palm oil, soybean oil, and the like; alkylated vegetable oils and alkyl esters of fatty acids such as methyloleate and the like.<br>
An agriculturally active compound is herein defined as any oil soluble compound, hydrophobic compound, or solid compound having a melting point of below about 95 degrees Celsius or less that shows some pesticidal or biocidal activity.

It is understood by those skilled in the art mat any combination of agriculturally active compounds may also be used in the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention as long as a stable and effective emulsion is still obtained.<br>
The amount of agriculturally active ingredient within the oil-in-water emulsion will vary depending upon the actual active ingredient, the application of the agriculturally active ingredient and the appropriate application levels which are well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the total amount of agriculturally active ingredient within the oil-in-water emulsion will be from about 1, generally from about 5, preferably from about 10, more preferably from about 15 and most preferably from about 20 to about 45, generally to about 40, preferably to about 35 and most preferably to about 30 weight percent based on the total weight of the oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
The polymeric surface active agent or a combination of polymeric surface active agents may be included in the aqueous phase to stabilize the formulation in the presence of electrolytes. The polymeric surface active agent is typically an<br>
amphipathic block or graft copolymer with molecular weight greater than 1500. These consist of at least two chemically bound homopolymer components, one of which is soluble in the aqueous phase (hydrophilic part) of the formulation, while the other is normally insoluble (hydrophobic part). The latter, termed the anchor polymer, serves to attach the soluble species to the oil droplets. The soluble chains, which project away from the oil droplet surface into the aqueous phase together with the lamellar liquid crystal coating (to prevent oil droplet coalesce), sterically prevent oil droplets from approaching together, therefore stabilize oil-in-water emulsions. The polymeric surface active agent typically has a Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance of greater than 12. Examples of suitable polymeric surface active agents may include Toximul 8323, Soprophor 796P, and Atlas G5000.<br>
Examples of such agriculturally active ingredients that may be used in the oil-in-water emulsion composition of the present disclosure include Fluroxpyr Meptyl, Chloropyrifos, Chlorpyrifos methyl, Trifluralin, Cyhalofop butyl, Euialfluralin, Benfluralin, Myclobutanil, Acequinocyl, Alpha-cypermethrin, Amitraz, Bensultap, Beta-cyfludirin, Beta-cypermethrin, Bifenox, Bifenthrin, Bioresmethrin, Bromoxynil Octanoate, Butralin, Cyflufenamid, Cyfluthrin, Cypermethrin, Diclofop-methyl, Dicofol, Esfenvalerate, Ethalfluralin, Etofenprox, Fenazaquin, Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, Fenpropathrin, Fenvalerate, Flumiclorac-pentyl, Fluoroglycofen-ethyl, Flurazole, Haloxyfop-etotyl, Indoxacarb, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Metamifop, Methoxychlor, Oxyfluorfen, Pendimethalin, Permethrin, Propaquizafop, Pyributicarb, Quizalofop-P-ethyl, Trifloxystrobin, Bromophos, Fenoxaprop-ethyl, Fluazolate, Nitrofen, and Profluralin.<br>
The components of the oil-in-water emulsion are combined using a process described below to produce oily globules having a lamellar liquid crystal coating. The lamellar liquid crystal coating is an extremely fine mono-or oligolamellar layer. Oligolamellar layer is understood to refer to a layer comprising from 2 to 5 lipid lamellae. This lamellar liquid crystal coating can be detected by<br>
Transmission Electronic Microscopy after cryofracture or negative stain, X-Ray diffraction or Optical Microscopy under polarized light. Terms and structure of lamellar crystal liquid phase are well defined in "The Colloidal Domain" second edition, by D. Fennell Evans and H. Wennerstrom, Wiley-VCH (1999), pages 295-296 and 306-307. The oligolamellar layer is comprised of the non-ionic lipophilic, non-ionic hydrophilic, and ionic surface-active agents, as stated previously. Preferably, the lipophilic surface-active agent and the hydrophilic surface-active agent each contain at least one optionally saturated and/or branched fatty hydrocarbon chain having more than 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 16 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>

As described above, the surface-active agents form the lamellar liquid crystal coating of the oily globules suspended within the aqueous phase of the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention. The amount of the three surface-active agents utilized in the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention is typically from about 20, preferably from about 35 to about 65, preferably to about 55 weight percent of non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, from about 15, preferably from about 25 to about 50, preferably to about 40 weight percent of non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent and from about 5, preferably from about 10 to about 45, preferably to about 35 weight percent of ionic surface-active agent, based on the total combined weight of surface active agents. The amount of the polymeric surface-active agents utilized in the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention is typically from about 0.1 to about 6 weight percent based on the total weight of oil-in-water emulsion. The coating of the oily globules comprises a total amount of hydrophilic surface-active agent, lipophilic surface-active agent and ionic surface-active agent to be between about 2 and about 20 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the oil-in-water emulsion. Preferably the total amount is from about 2.5, more preferably from about 3 to 10, more preferably to about 6 weight percent, based on the total weight of the oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
The ratio of the total weight of the surface-active compounds (excluding polymeric surface-active compounds) to the total weight of oil is typically from 1:2.5 to 1:25.<br>
The aqueous phase is typically water, for example, deionized water. The aqueous phase may also contain other additives such as compounds that lower the freezing point, for example alcohols, e.g. isopropyl alcohol and propylene glycol; pH buffering agents, for example alkali phosphates such as sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, sodium phosphate dibasic; biocides, for example Proxel GXL; and antifoams, for example octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (Antifoam A from Dow Corning).

The oil phase or the coated oily globules are from 5, preferably from 8 and more preferably from 10 to 50 percent, preferably to 45 and most preferably to 40 weight percent, based on the total weight of the oil-in-water emulsion composition. The oil/water ratio is typically less than or equal to 1.<br>
Other additives and/or adjuvants can also be present within the oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention, as long as the stability and activity of the oil-in-water emulsion is still obtained. The oil-in-water emulsions of the present invention may additionally contain adjuvant surface-active agents to enhance deposition, wetting and penetration of the agriculturally active ingredient onto the target site, e.g. crop, weed or organism.   These adjuvant surface-active agents may optionally be employed as a component of the emulsion in either the oil or water phase, or as a tank mix component; the use of and amount desired being well known by those skilled in me art. Suitable adjuvant surface-active agents include, but are not limited to ethoxylated nonyl phenols, ethoxylated synthetic or natural<br>

The oil-in-water emulsion of the present invention can be prepared according to the process described in U.S. 5,925,364, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The agriculturally active ingredient or a combination of agriculturally active ingredients is first melted or dissolved into the solvent if desired, after which the nonionic surface-active agent(s) is dissolved into the mixture. The then mixture with the aqueous phase including the polymeric surface active agent and the ionic surface active is homogenized by cavitation using a high pressure homogenizer, to provide the small particle sized oily globules. The mean size of the coated oily globules is typically less than 800 nanometers, preferably less than 500 nanometers and most preferably about 200 nanometers, as determined using laser diffraction particle size analysis and scanning electron microscopy.<br>
In one embodiment, the oil-in-water emulsion is prepared by:<br>
1)	melting or dissolving an agriculturally active ingredient(s) into an optional polymeric modifier and optionally a suitable solvent;<br>
2)	mixing an oil phase, comprising the lipophilic surfactant, the polymeric modifier (if used) containing the dissolved agriculturally active ingredient(s), the hydrophilic surfactant, an agriculturally active compound and optionally a suitable solvent and (B) an aqueous phase including the polymeric surface active agent and the ionic surface active agent to obtain a mixture; and<br>
3)	homogenizing the mixture by subjecting the mixture to cavitation.<br>
In the first step, the mixture can be formed by conventional stirring, for<br>
example, using a high shear homogenizer rotating at a rate of approximately<br>
between 2000 and 7000 rpm for a time approximately between 5 and 60 minutes and at a temperature between approximately 20°C and 95°C.<br>
The homogenization can be performed by using a high pressure homogenizer operating at pressures between approximately 200 and 1000 bar as is well known to those skilled in the art. The process is performed by successive passages, generally from 1 to 12 passages, at a selected pressure; the mixture being returned to normal pressure between each passage. The homogenization of the second step may also be carried out under the action of ultrasound or alternatively by the use of a homogenizer equipped with a rotor-stator type head.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the use of the oil-in-water emulsion in agricultural applications to control, prevent or eliminate unwanted living organisms, e.g. fungi, weeds, insects, bacteria or other microorganisms and other pests. This would include its' use for protection of a plant against attack by a phytopathogenic organism or the treatment of a plant already infested by a phytopathogenic organism, comprising applying the oil-in-water emulsion composition, to soil, a plant, a part of a plant, foliage, flowers, fruit, and/or seeds in a disease inhibiting and phytologically acceptable amount. The term "disease inhibiting and phytologically acceptable amount" refers to an amount of a compound that kills or inhibits the plant disease for which control is desired, but is not significantly toxic to the plant. The exact concentration of active compound required varies with the fungal disease to be controlled, the type of formulations employed, the method of application, the particular plant species, climate conditions, and me like, as is well known in the art.<br>
Additionally, the oil-in-water emulsions of the present invention are useful for the control of insects or other pests, e.g. rodents. Therefore, the present invention also is directed to a method for inhibiting an insect or pest which comprises applying to a locus of the insect or pest an oil-in-water emulsion comprising an insect-inhibiting amount of an agriculturally active compound for<br>
such use. The "locus" of insects or pests is a term used herein to refer to the environment in which the insects or pests live or where their eggs are present, including the air surrounding them, the food they eat, or objects which they contact. For example, insects which eat or contact edible or ornamental plants can be controlled by applying the active compound to plant parts such as the seed, seedling, or cutting which is planted, the leaves, stems, fruits, grain, or roots, or to the soil in which the roots are growing . It is contemplated that the agriculturally active compounds and oil-in-water emulsions containing such, might also be useful to protect textiles, paper, stored grain, seeds, domesticated animals, buildings or human beings by applying an active compound to or near such objects. The term "inhibiting an insect or pest" refers to a decrease in the numbers of living insects or pests, or a decrease in the number of viable insect eggs. The extent of reduction accomplished by a compound depends, of course, upon the application rate of the compound, the particular compound used, and the target insect or pest species. At least an inactivating amount should be used. The terms "insect or pest-inactivating amount" are used to describe the amount, which is sufficient to cause a measurable reduction in the treated insect or pest population, as is well known in the art.<br>
The locus to which a compound or composition is applied can be any locus inhabited by an insect, mite or pest, for example, vegetable crops, fruit and nut trees, grape vines, ornamental plants, domesticated animals, the interior or exterior surfaces of buildings, and the soil around buildings.<br>
Because of the unique ability of insect eggs to resist toxicant action, repeated applications may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae, as is true of other known insecticides and acaricides.<br>
Additionally, the present invention relates to the use of oil-in-water emulsions comprising agriculturally active compounds which are herbicides. The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient mat kills, controls or<br>
otherwise adversely modifies the growth of plants. An herbicidally effective or vegetation controlling amount is an amount of active ingredient which causes an adversely modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, desiccation, retardation, and the like. The terms plants and vegetation include emerging seedlings and established vegetation.<br>
Herbicidal activity is exhibited when they are applied directly to the locus of the undesirable plant thereof at any stage of growth or before emergence of the weeds. The effect observed depends upon the plant species to be controlled, the stage of growth of the plant, the particle size of solid components, the environmental conditions at the time of use, the specific adjuvants and carriers employed, the soil type, and the like, as well as the amount of chemical applied. These and other factors can be adjusted as is known in the art to promote selective herbicidal action. Generally, it is preferred to apply such herbicides post emergence to relatively immature undesirable vegetation to achieve the maximum control of weeds.<br>
Another specific aspect of the present invention is a method of preventing or controlling pests such as nematodes, mites, arthropods, rodents, termites, bacteria or other microorganisms, comprising applying to a locus where control or prevention is desired a composition of the present invention which comprises the appropriate active compound such as a nematocide, miticide, arthropodicide, rodenticide, termiticide or biocide.<br>
The actual amount of agriculturally active compound to be applied to loci of disease, insects and mites, weeds or other pests is well known in the art and can readily be determined by those skilled in the art in view of the teachings above.<br>
The composition of the present invention surprisingly offers stable agricultural oil-in-water emulsions having low viscosity and long term shelf life. Additionally, the stable agricultural oil-in-water emulsions of the present invention can offer other surprising improvements, e.g. efficacy.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention. The examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention and they should not be so interpreted. Amounts are in weight parts or weight percentages unless omerwise indicated.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
These examples are provided to further illustrate the invention and are not meant to be construed as limiting.<br>
As disclosed herein, all temperatures are given in degrees Celsius and all percentages are weight percentages unless omerwise stated.<br>
In these examples, the process is performed using the following procedure:<br>
The soybean oil modeling agriculturally active ingrethent is mixed with non-ionic surfactants (the oil phase A). The phase A is poured into the aqueous phase B including polymeric surface active agents, ionic surface agent and NaCl, with stirring of 4000 - 8000 rpm provided by a Silverson L4RT high shear homogenizer fitted with a square hole high shear screen. Stirring and temperature conditions are maintained for 10 minutes.<br>
The mixture is men introduced into a Niro Soavi high pressure 2-stage homogenizer of type Panda 2K, which is adjusted to a pressure of 1000 bar for 1 to 12 successive passages.<br>
A stabilized oil-in-water emulsion is thus obtained, the oily globules of which have a mean diameter of typically around 200 nm.<br>
Example 1: Effect of polymeric surface active agent on oil-in-water emulsion stability in salt environment.<br>
 <br>
In order to illustrate the effect of polymeric surface active agents on oil-in-water emulsion stability in a salt environment, a model emulsion including soybean oil was developed as shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: 30% soybean oil emulsion<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The developed model soybean oil emulsion was very stable. The emulsion did not experience any increase in particle size at Freeze/Thaw and 54 °C over a 2 week period.<br>
Next, a similar emulsion was made including 0.01 M sodium chloride. The formulation is listed in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: 30% soybean oil EcoZome with 0.01 M NaCl<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Water (balanced ingredient)   55.8<br>
The soybean oil emulsion with 0.01 M NaCl was unstable. Phase separation occurred after two weeks storage at 54°C.<br>
Two exemplary polymeric surfactants were chosen to add to the above formulation to improve stabilization at salt conditions. Table 3 and Table 4 show two exemplary formulations at salt conditions.<br>
Table 3: 30% soybean oil EcoZome with 4% Toximul 8223 and 0.4 M NaCl<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Table 4: 30% Soybean Oil EcoZome with 0.5% Soprophor 796/P and 0.2 M NaCl<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
<br>
Both samples were stable after 2 weeks storage at 54 °C and Freeze/Thaw (temperature cycled from 40 °C to -10 °C every 24 hours). The addition of an polymeric surface active agents improved the salt tolerant property of the emulsion by about 40 times.<br>
Example 2: Effect of salt concentration on emulsion stabilized by polymeric surfactant.<br>
The effect of salt concentration on an emulsion stabilized by a polymeric surfactant was investigated at a model formulation shown in Table 5. The salt concentration was varied at 0.4 M, 0.5M and 0.6M.<br>
Table 5: 30% soybean oil ecozome with 4% Toximul 8223 and 0.4 M, 0.5M &amp; 0.6M NaCl<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
It was found that at 0.4M NaCl concentration, the sample was stable after 2 weeks at 54 °C and Freeze/Thaw (temperature cycled from 40 °C to -10 °C every 24 hours), while at higher salt concentrations (0.5 M &amp; 0.6M), samples<br>
were stable after 2 weeks at 54 °C, but oil droplets started growing after 2 weeks at F/T.<br>
Example 3: Effect of polymeric surfactant concentration on the stability of emulsion at salt environment<br>
The effect of polymeric surfactant concentration on the stability of EcoZomes at salt environment was studied using a model system shown in Table 6.<br>
Table 6: 30% soybean oil ecozome with 0.4 M NaCl &amp; 0.5%, 2% &amp; 4% Soprophor 796/P<br>
 (Table Removed) <br>
In this example, the salt concentration was fixed at 0.4M, while the concentration of Soprophor 796/P was varied from 0.5% to 4%. It was found that there may exist an optimized polymer surface active agent concentration. At 2% of Soprophor 796/P concentration, the emulsion was relatively stable at both 54 °C and F/T conditions, while increasing or decreasing, polymeric surface active agent concentration showed less stable behavior including phase separation in both samples after two weeks in storage.<br>
