				<td>FILED OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to process and apparatus for production of metal matrix composite billets reinforced with silicon carbide (SiCp) particulate, through explosive compaction. Though the present invention is described in relation to explosive compaction process for 2124 aluminium alloy reinforced with silicon carbide (SiCp) particulate to produce metal matrix composite billets, however, it is not intended to imply any limitation as the apparatus and process of the present invention can be used for alloys of other metals and also for other grades of aluminium besides the grade 2124 of aluminium described in the present invention.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Silicon carbide particulate reinforced aluminium metal matrix composites have higher stiffness and resistance to fatigue, creep and wear compared to many wrought aluminium alloys. These materials are receiving &amp; great deal of attention for demanding applications in aerospace, electronic packaging and automobile industries.<br><br>
Conventional  powder metallurgy process  for production  of  2124 Al alloy-with upto 30  vol.%  SiCp) metal matrix composite billets involves cold  compaction followed  by hot  pressing  which  are cumbersome  and experts be.<br>
The above conventional process has the disadvantage that it involves high capital investments in equipment.<br>
Another disadvantage of above process is that it involves undesirable long processing time.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above process is that it requires prolonged exposure to high temperature which in turn has the disadvantage that it shortens the life of the composites.<br>
Further disadvantage of the above process is that the prolonged exposure to high temperature, required in these processes, leads to the formation of coarse intermetal1ic compounds which adversely affect the properties of the composites billets.<br>
Yet further disadvantage of the above process is that it degrades the microstructure of 2124 Al alloy powders.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an explosive compaction process and an apparatus thereof, for producing metal matrix composite billets of metals in general, particularly for explosive compaction of 2124 Al alloy reinforced with silicon carbide (SiCp) particulate to produce metal matrix composite billets.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process and an apparatus which produces metal matrix composite billets of 2124 Al with SiCp which have density comparable to that obtained by conventional hot pressing.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a single stage process for composite powder compaction, to produce metal matrix billets, directly from the raw material, thereby eliminating the need for secondary forming operations like forging and extrusion.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a process and an apparatus which provides a<br><br>
significantly economical process for producing metal matrix composite billets of 2124 Al with SiCp as it avoids the requirement of large presses and extrusion machinery.<br>
Still further objects of the present invention is to propose a process and an apparatus which produces metal matrix composite billets of 21 24 Al with SiCp in comparatively less time as compared to the conventional process.<br>
Yet further objects of the present invention is to propose a process and an apparatus which produces metal matrix composite billets of 2 124 Al with SiCp, wherein the original powder microstructure is retained even after the compaction process is completed.<br>
