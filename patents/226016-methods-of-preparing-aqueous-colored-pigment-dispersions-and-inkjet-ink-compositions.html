TITLE<br>
METHODS FOR PREPARING AQUEOUS  COLORED PIGMENT DISPERSIONS,   AND INKJET COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
1.[0001]	The present invention relates to methods for preparing aqueous colored<br>
pigment dispersions. Inkjet ink compositions are also disclosed.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art.<br>
[0002]	In general, pigments alone are not readily disperslble in liquid vehicles.<br>
A variety of techniques have been developed which can provide stable pigment dispersions. For example, dispersants can be added to the pigment to improve its dispersibility in a particular medium. Examples of dispersants for an aqueous medium include water-soluble polymers and surfactants.<br>
[0003]	Colored pigment dispersions have been prepared using dispersants<br>
having a structural unit similar if not identical to the chemical unit of the colored<br>
pigment. For example, GB2356866 discloses a bis-azo compound derived from<br>
diazotized (caiboxy/sulfo)-anilines and l,4-bis(acetoacetamido)phenylenes and their<br>
use in pigment and ink compositions. These materials were found to be particularly<br>
useful in combination with yellow or orange pigments having nearly the identical<br>
structure. GB2356634 describes very similar mono-azo compounds for the same use.<br>
GB2364322 describes N-sulfophenyl-alpha--methoxy-nitrophenylazo)<br>
acetacetamides for use with monoazo pigments, particularly yellow pigments.<br>
[0004]	These colored pigment dispersants are prepared by the addition of a<br>
diazonium salt (the diazo component) with a compoundCaPAble of reacting witha diazonium salt (the azo coupling component). Once prepared, the resulting dispersant<br><br>
is then added, under specified conditions, to the colored pigment in order to form a colored pigment dispersion.<br>
[0005]	Other methods of controlling the dispersibility of colored pigments are<br>
also known- For example, International Patent Application No. WO00/26304 discloses the preparation of a crystal growth inhibitor that controls the amount of crystallinity developed during the process of preparing a colored pigment and prevents recrystallization of dispersed pigments. The crystal growth inhibitor is prepared using a process similar to the known process for preparing the pigment (for example, by the reaction of a diazonium salt with an azo coupling agent), and can also be prepared in situ during the preparation of the colored pigment. Also, in U.S. Patent No. 6,451,103, water soluble pigment derivatives, which are pigments further substituted with an acidic functional group or salt, are used to prepare aqueous dispersions of that specific pigment Inkjet inks are also disclosed.<br>
[0006]	Modified colored pigments have also been developed which provide<br>
ink compositions with improved properties, such as dispersibility, For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,851,280 discloses methods for the attachment of organic groups onto pigments including, for example, attachment via a diazonium reaction wherein the organic group is part of the diazonium salt The resulting surface-modified pigments can be used in avarietyofapplications,suchasiiiks,inkjetinks,coatings, toners, plastics, rubbers, and the like.<br>
[0007J	PCT International Publication No. WO 01/51566 describes a method<br>
of making a modified pigment by reacting a first chemical group and a second chemical group to form a pigment having attached a third chemical group. The first chemical group includes at least one nucleophile and the second chemical group includes at least one electrophile, or vice versa. These pigments are used in ink compositions and, in particular, inkjet ink compositions.<br>
[0008]	While these  efforts provide modified pigments with improved<br>
properties and, in particular, improved dispersibility, there remains a need for methods of preparing aqueous colored pigment dispersions and inkjet ink compositions.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention relates to a method of preparing an aqueous<br>
colored pigment dispersion comprising the step of combining, in any order, a) a colored pigment, b) an azo coupler, c) an aromatic amine, d) a diazotizing agent, and e) an aqueous medium, wherein the aromatic amine comprises as least one ionic group, at least one ionizable group, or a mixture of at least one ionic group and at least one ionizable group. Specific combinations of steps as well as specific combinations of a)-e) are disclosed.<br>
[0010]	The present invention further relates to an Inkjet ink composition<br>
comprising a) a liquid vehicle, b) a colored pigment, and c) a dispersant having the formula; <br>
wherein AC is an azo coupling component and D is a diazo component comprising at least one ionic group, at least one ionizable "group, or a mixture of at least one ionic group or ionizable group. Preferably the inkjet ink composition is an aqueous inkjet ink composition.<br>
[0011]	It is to be understood lhat both the foregoing general description and<br>
the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the present invention, as claimed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]	The present invention relates to methods for preparing aqueous colored<br>
pigment dispersions and inkjet ink compositions.<br>
[0013]	The method of the present invention comprises the step of combining<br>
a) a colored pigment, b) an azo coupler, c) an aromatic amine, d) a diazotizing agent, and e) an aqueous medium. Each of these components will be described in more detail below. The components can be combined in any order and under any condition such that an aqueous colored pigment dispersion results. For example, the colored<br><br>
gment and azo coupler may be combined, either dry or in a liquid medium, to form a etreated colored pigment, which is subsequently combined with the aromatic amine  diazotizing agent, preferably in an aqueous medium. Also, the aromatic amine  diazotizing agent may be combined in a liquid medium, preferably an aqueous ledium, to form a diazonium salt. This can then be combined, in any order, with the olored pigment and/or azo coupler, or a combination of the colored pigment and azo oupler as described above, to form a colored pigment dispersion. Other ombinations are also possible.<br>
0014]	As discussed previously, prior art methods for preparing colored<br>
sigment dispersions have typically involved the formation of a dispersant, often taving structural characteristics similar to the colorant of the colored pigment. These lispersanta are formed by combining a diazonium salt, prepared from an aromatic imine and a diazotizing agent, with an azo coupler. The resulting material is then iddcd to the colored pigment to form the final dispersion. Thus, the dispersant for the colored pigment is formed independently of the colored pigment itself Contrary to the prior art methods, in a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, it has surprisingly been found that an azo coupler and diazonium salt, formed by the reaction of an aromatic amine and a diazotizing agent, can be combined in the presence of a colored pigment, resulting in the formation of a colored pigment dispersion. This may be considered to be an in situ method of forming a colored pigment dispersion. Surprisingly, there is no interference of the colored pigment with the reaction of these materials. For example the azo coupler would be expected to have a high affinity for the surface of the colored pigment and would therefore adsorb to the surface, making it unavailable for reaction with a diazonium salt. Alternatively, diazonium salts have been shown to react with colored pigments, and therefore the colored pigment might be expected to compete with the azo coupler, interfering with the reaction. Other potential problems could be anticipated, such as the formation of unwanted by-products, as well as solubility and pH effects. However, despite these potential problems, it has been found that the in situ method of the present invention can be used to successful prepare stable colored pigment dispersions.<br><br>
[0015]	When the colored pigment and azo coupler are combined to form <br>
pretreated colored pigment, the resulting pretreated colored pigment may be in either liquid or a dry form. Thus, for example, a pretreated colored pigment may be prepared by combining an azo coupler and a colored pigment in a liquid medium preferably an aqueous medium. The liquid form may then be dried to form \ pretreated colored pigment solid The pretreated colored pigment, either the liquic form, or the dry form, may then be combined with the aromatic amine and diazotizinj agent. The dry pretreated colored pigment may be in any form, such as, for example a powder, a pressed cake, a granule, or a pellet.<br>
[0016]	In addition, the colored pigment may comprise the azo coupler.  Fo<br>
example, if the azo coupler is a reagent used during the preparation of the colore<br>
pigment, and is used in excess, the resulting colored pigment would comprise coloran<br>
and azo coupler. This type of colored pigment, either in the liquid or dry form, ha<br>
been found to be particularly useful in the method of the present invention. In thi<br>
case, it has been found that the step of adding azo coupler may be optional.<br>
[0017]	As stated above, the components used in the method of the preset<br>
invention may be combined under any conditions which result in an aqueous colore pigment dispersion. Preferably, the components are combined at a temperatur between about -10 and about 50 degrees C, more preferably between about 0 an about 25 degrees C, and most preferably between about 0 and about 10 degrees C Combining the components within these temperature ranges has been found t produce aqueous colored pigment dispersions efficiently and with minimal sid products.<br>
[0018]	It is also preferred that the components are combined under mixic<br>
conditions in which shear or a grinding action is also applied to the mixture. Th applied shear or grinding action helps to ensure that the components are intimate; mixed. A variety of types of equipment known in the art may be used, including, b not limited to, horizontal media mills, vertical media mills such as attritors, ball mill hammer mills, pin disk mills, fluid energy mills, jet mills, fluid jet mills, impingeme jet mills, rotor-stators, pelletizers, homogenizers, sonicators, cavitators, and the lik The same vessel may also be used throughout the method of the present invention.<br><br>
[0019]	The colored pigment used in the method of the present invention may<br>
be chosen from a wide range of conventional colored pigments. The colored pigment<br>
can be blue, black, brown, cyan, green, white, violet, magenta, red, orange, or yellow,<br>
as well as mixtures thereof. Mixtures of pigments may also be used. Suitable classes<br>
of colored pigments include, for example, disazos, monoazos, and heterocyclic azo<br>
yellows (including diarylides and disazo condensation pigments), and naphthol-AS's.<br>
Representative examples of azo yellows include Pigment Yellow 1, Pigment Yellow<br>
3, Pigment Yellow 12, Pigment Yellow 13, Pigment Yellow 14, Pigment Yellow 17,<br>
Pigment Yellow 65, Pigment Yellow 73, Pigment Yellow 74, Pigment Yellow 151,<br>
and Pigment Yellow 128. Representative examples of naphthol-AS'a include Pigment<br>
Red 170, Pigment Red 185, Pigment Red 187, Pigment Red 238, Pigment Red 269,<br>
Pigment Orange 38, and Pigment Violet 25. Such pigments are commercially<br>
available in either powder or press cake form from a number of sources including,<br>
BASF Corporation, Engelhard Corporation and Sun Chemical Corporation. Examples<br>
of other suitable colored pigments are described in the Colour Index, 3rd edition (The<br>
"Society of Dyers and Colourists, 1982).<br>
[0020]	The colored pigment can have a wide range of BET surface areas, as<br>
measured by nitrogen adsorption, and therefore, a wide range of particle sizes. It iB preferred to have a colored pigment having a small particle size in order to prepare colored pigment dispersions having desirable overall properties, such as stability. If the preferred smaller particle size (and therefore higher surfece area) colored pigment is not readily available, it is well recognized by those skilled in the art that the colored pigment may be subjected to conventional size comminution or reduction techniques, such as ball or jet milling, to reduce the pigment to the desired particle size prior to use in the method described herein.<br>
[00211	The azo coupler used in the method of the present invention is a<br>
material capable of reacting to form an azo compound. The reaction of azo couplers are well known in the art. In general, an azo coupler reacts with a diazonium reagent to form an azo compound, which is a material having an -N-N- functionality. Examples of azo couplers that may be used in the method of the present invention include, but are not limited to, 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds such as acetoacetamides,<br><br>
including (acetoacetamido)ben2dmidazolones, and acetoacetic esters; electron rich aromatic compounds such as phenols and hydroxynaphthalenes; barbituric acid and derivatives of barbituric acid; and electron rich heteroaromatic compounds such as hydroxypyridones and pyrazolones.<br>
[0022]	It is preferred that the azo coupler be structurally similar to the colored<br>
pigment used. In particular, it is preferred that the azo coupler be structurally similar or identical to the azo coupler used to prepare the colored pigment, hi this way, the azo coupler, and any associated reaction products resulting from the method described herein, will have a high affinity for the colored pigment and may therefore interact more strongly with the colored pigment, to produce a colored pigment dispersion having desirable overall properties.<br>
[0023]	Thus, for example, the azo coupler may comprise an acetoacetamide<br>
group, such as acetoacet-o-anisidide. This type of azo coupler is preferably used with a disazo or monoazo pigment also comprising an acetoacetamide group. Examples include, but are not limited to, yellow pigments such as Pigment Yellow 74, Pigment Yellow 65, and Pigment Yellow 73.<br>
[0024]	The azo coupler may also comprise a hydroxypyridone group.   For<br>
example, the azo coupler may be a hydroxypyridone having the general structure:<br><br>
wherein R is a hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group. Preferably R is H, a methyl group, or an ethyl group. This type of azo coupler is preferably used with a disazo or monoazo pigment also comprising an hydroxypyridone group. Examples include, but are not limited to, yellow or orange pigments Pigment Yellow 201 and Disperse Yellow 241.<br><br>
[0025]	The azo coupler may also comprise a hydroxynaphthalene group. For<br>
example, the azo coupler may he a derivative of 2-hydroxynaphthalene-3-carboxylic acid. Examples include amides o f 2 -hydroxynaphthalene-3-caiboxylic a cid s uch a s naphthol AS, naphthol AS-PH, naphthol AS-OL, naphthol AS-KB, naphthol AS-LC, naphthol AS-BG, naphthol AS-BO, naphthol AS-BS, naphthol AS-CA, naphthol AS-D, and naphthol AS-TTR This type of azo coupler is preferably used with naphthol-AS pigments which also comprise a hydroxynaphthalene group. Examples include, but are not limited, to, red, magenta, or violet pigments such as Pigment Red 170, Pigment Red 185, Pigment Red 238, Pigment Red 269, Pigment Orange 38, and Pigment Violet 25.<br>
[0026]	An aromatic amine is also used in the method of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the aromatic amine comprises at least one ionic group, at least one<br>
ionizable group, or a mixture of at least one ionic group and at least one ionizable'<br>
group. An ionic group is either anionic or cationic and is associated with a counterion.<br>
of the opposite charge including inorganic or organic counterions such as Na+, K+,<br>
Li+, NH4+, NR'4+ acetate, NQf, S04'2, R'S03', R'OS03", OH', and Cl", where R*<br>
represents hydrogen or an organic group such as a substituted or unsubstituted aryl<br>
and/or alkyl group. An ionizable group is one that is capable of forming an ionic<br>
group in the medium of use. Anionizable groups form anions and cationizable groups<br>
form cations. Organic ionic groups include those described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,698,016, the description of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0027]	The ionic or ionizable group may be an anionic or anionizable group.<br>
Anionic groups are negatively charged ionic groups that may be generated from groups having ionizable substituents that can form anions (anionizable groups), such as acidic substituents. They may also be the anion in the salts of ionizable substituents.    Representative examples of anionic groups include -COO", -S03",<br>
-OS03", -HP03", -OPO-, and -P03"2. Representative examples of anionizable groups<br>
include -COOH, -S03H, -POjHy -R'SH, -R'OH, and -S02NHCOR, where R<br>
represents hydrogen or an organic group such as a substituted or unsubstituted aryl and/or alkyl group. Preferably the aromatic amine comprises at least one sulfonic acid group, carboxylic add group, or salts thereof.<br><br>
[0028]	The iorric or ionizable group may also be a cationic or cationizable<br>
group. Cationic groups are positively charged organic ionio groups that may be generated from ionizable substituents that can form cations (cationizable groups), such as protonated amines. For example, alkyl or aiyl amines may be protonated in acidic media to form ammonium groups -NR'2H+, where Rf represent an organic group such as<br>
a substituted or unsubstituted aryl and/or alkyl group. Cationic groups may also be positively charged organic ionic groups. Examples include quaternary ammonium groups (-NR34) and quaternary phosphonium groups (-FR34).   Here, R1 represents<br>
hydrogen or an organic group such as a substituted or unsubstituted aryl and/or alkyl group. P referably, the aromatic amine comprises at least one amine group or a salt thereof, or at least one quaternary ammonium group.<br>
[0029]	The aromatic amine may further be substituted with one or more<br>
functional groups. Examples of functional groups include, but are not limited to, R", OR", COR", COOR", OCOR", carboxylates, halogens, CN, NR"2, S03H, sulfonates,   .<br>
sulfates, NR"(COR")a CONR"2, N02&gt;. POJHJ, phosphonates, phosphates, N=NR",'<br>
SOR", NS02R", wherein R", which can be the same or different, is independently<br>
hydrogen, b ranched or unbranched C j-C20 substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaiyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkaryl, or substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl. Preferably the aromatic amine is p-aminobenzoic acid or sulfanilic acid.<br>
[0030]	A diazotizing agent is also combined in the method of the present<br>
invention. A diazotizing agent is any reagent that reacts with an amine group to form a diazonium salt. Examples include nitrous acid and nitrite salts. Preferably, the diazotizing agent is a salt having a nitrite counterfoil such as sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite, or calcium nitrite. The diazotizing agent may also be the aromatic amine comprising a cationic group, such as a quaternary ammonium group, in which the counterion of the quaternary ammonium group is a nitrite.<br>
[0031]	The aqueous medium used in the method of the present invention is<br>
any medium containing water. Thus, the aqueous medium can be; for example, water<br><br>
or mixtures of water with water miscible solvents such as alcohols. Preferably the aqueous vehicle is water. The aqueous medium may be any pH but is preferably acidic. Thus, acid may preferably be added to the aqueous medium in order to form a low pH aqueous medium.<br>
[0032]	The amounts of each component may be varied in order to obtain a<br>
colored pigment dispersion having desirable overall properties. Thus, the amount of azo coupler is preferably about 0.05-10%, more preferably about 0.1-5%, and most preferably about 1-5% based on the total weight of colored pigment The amount of aromatic amine is generally greater than or equal to one molar equivalent based on the amount of azo coupler. Preferably the aromatic amine is used up to about a 50% molar excess. The diazotizing agent is preferably used at the same molar amount as the aromatic amine. The amount of colored pigment is preferably about 0*5-50%, more preferably about 1-20%, and most preferably about 1-5% by weight based on the total weight of colored pigment dispersion.<br>
[0033]	In a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, the<br>
. azo coupler, aromatic amine, and diazotizing agent react to form a dispersant having the general formula: <br>
wherein AC is an azo coupling component and D is a diazo component comprising at<br>
least one ionic group, at least one ionizable group, or a mixture of at least one ionic<br>
group or ionizable group. The ionic or ionizable groups may be any of those<br>
described above for the aromatic amine. The group D may be further substituted with<br>
the same groups described for the aromatic amine above. The group AC may<br>
comprise the same groups as described above for the azo coupler. Thus, for example,<br>
the group AC may comprise an acetoacetamide group, an hydroxypyridone group, a<br>
pyrazolone group, or an hydroxynaphthalene group, as described above.<br>
[0034]	The colored pigment dispersions prepared by the method of the present<br>
invention may be purified by washing, such as by filtration, centrifugation, or a combination of the two methods, to remove unreacted raw materials, byproduct salts and other reaction impurities. The products may also be isolated, for example, by<br><br>
evaporation or it may be recovered by filtration and drying using known techniques to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0035]	The colored pigment dispersions may also be purified or classified to<br>
remove impurities and other undesirable free species which can co-exist in the<br>
dispersion as a result of the manufacturing process. For example, the dispersion can<br>
be purified to remove any undesired free species, such as unreacted azo coupler or<br>
aromatic amine. Known techniques of ultrafiltration/diafiltration using a membrane<br>
or ion exchange may be used to purify the dispersion and remove a substantial amount<br>
of free ionic and unwanted species. An optional exchange of counterions step may<br>
also occur in the purification process whereby the counterions that form a part of the<br>
modified pigment are exchanged or substituted with alternative counterions<br>
(including, e.g., amphiphilic ions) utilizing known ion exchange techniques such as<br>
ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange columns and the like. Particular<br>
examples of counterions that can be exchanged include, but are not limited to, Na+,<br>
K\ Li+, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, CI", N03", NO/, acetate, and Br\	.<br>
[0036]	The colored pigment dispersions can be formed with a minimum of<br>
additional components (additives and/or cosolvents) and processing steps. However,<br>
additives such as surfactants and cosolvents may also be included.<br>
[0037]	The colored pigment dispersions prepared by the method of the present<br>
invention may be useful in a variety of applications, including, but not limited to inks,<br>
coatings, plastics, paper, textiles, and rubber products.   In particular, the colored<br>
pigment dispersions have surprisingly been found to be effective inkjet ink<br>
compositions.<br>
[0038]	Therefore,  the present invention also relates to  an inkjet ink<br>
composition comprising a) a liquid vehicle, b) a colored pigment, and c) a dispersant<br>
having the formula:<br>
D-N=N-AC,<br>
wherein AC is an azo coupling component and D is a diazo component comprising at least one ionic group, at least one ionizable group, or a mixture of at least one ionic<br><br>
group or ionizable group.   The groups AC and D are the same as were described above.<br>
[0039]	In general, an inkjet ink composition consists of a vehicle, which<br>
functions as a carrier, and a colorant such as a dye or pigment. Additives and/or<br>
cosolvents can be incorporated in order to adjust the ink to attain the desired<br>
performance. Preferably, the liquid vehicle for the inkjet ink compositions of the<br>
present invention is an aqueous vehicle, and the inkjet ink composition is therefore an<br>
aqueous inkjet ink composition. The aqueous vehicle can be the same as described<br>
above in relation to the method of preparing the colored pigment dispersion.<br>
[00401	The colored pigments used in the inkjet ink compositions of the present<br>
invention are the same as were described above and are present in an amount effective<br>
to provide the desired image quality (for example, optical density) without<br>
detrimentally affecting the performance of the inkjet ink. For example, typically the<br>
colored pigment will be present in an amount ranging from about 0.1% to about 20%<br>
based on the weight of the ink. Mixtures of pigments may also be used. In addition, it<br>
is also within the bounds of the present invention to use a formulation containing a<br>
modified pigment product as described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos* 5,630,868,<br>
5,803,959,5,837,045, and 5,922,118, all incorporated in their entirety by reference.<br>
[0041]	The inkjet ink compositions of the present invention can be formed<br>
with a minimum of additional components (additives and/or cosolvents)' and<br>
processing steps. However, suitable additives may also be incorporated into these<br>
inkjet ink compositions to impart a number of desired properties while maintaining<br>
the stability of the compositions. For example, surfactants may be added to further<br>
enhance the colloidal stability of the composition. Other additives are well known in<br>
the art and include humectants, biocides, binders, drying accelerators, penetrants, and<br>
the like. The amount of a particular additive will vary depending on a variety of<br>
factors but are generally present in an amount ranging between 0% and 40%.<br>
[0042]	Additionally, the inkjet ink compositions of the present invention may<br>
further incorporate dyes to modify color balance and adjust optical density. Such dyes include food dyes, FD&amp;C dyes, acid dyes, direct dyes, reactive dyes, derivatives of<br><br>
phthalocyanine sulfonic acids, including copper phthalocyanine derivatives, sodium<br>
salts, ammonium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, and the like.<br>
[0043]	The dispersant may be prepared by any method known in the art, but is<br>
preferably prepared using the method described above. Thus, a preferred method for preparing this dispersant is to combine an azo coupler, an aromatic amine comprising at least one ionic group, at least one ionizable group, or a mixture of at least one ionic or ionizable group, and a diazotizing agent in an aqueous medium in the presence of a colored pigment. However, prior art methods of forming the dispersant may also be used. T hus, a diazonium salt, formed by the reaction of an aromatic amine and a diazotizing agent, can be combined with the azo coupler to form the dispsersant, which can then be combined with the colored pigment to form a stable dispersion that has surprisingly been found to be useful in an inkjet ink composition. The azo coupler, aromatic amine, diazotizing agent, and aqueous medium are as described above.<br>
[0044]	Preferred e xamples o f d ispersants h aving t he formula shown include<br>
those in which the group AC comprises an acetoacetamide group, an hydroxypyridone group, a pyrazolone group, or an hydroxynaphthalene group. Thus, for example, a preferred dispersant has the formula:<br><br>
wherein n is an integer from 1-5,1 is an ionic group or an ionizable group, and Ar is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group. This type of dispersant has been found to be particularly useful in an inkjet ink composition comprising a colored pigment also comprising an acetoacetamide group, such as those described above. Another preferred dispersant has the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R is a hydrogen, a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group, or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic group, and n and I are as described above. This type of dispersant has been found to be particularly useful in an inkjet ink composition comprising a colored pigment also comprising a hydroxypyridone group, such as those described above. Yet another preferred dispersant has the formula:<br><br>
wherein n, I, and Ar are as described above. This type of dispersant has been found to be particularly useful in inkjet ink compositions comprising a colored pigment also comprising a hydroxynaphthalene group, such as those described above. Other combinations of pigments and dispersants will be known to those skilled in the art based on the disclosure herein.<br>
[0045]	The inkjet ink compositions can be purified and/or classified using<br>
methods such as those described above for the colored pigment dispersions described above, hi this way, unwanted impurities or undesirable large particles can be removed to produce an inkjet ink with good overall properties.<br><br>
[0046]	The present invention will be further clarified by the following<br>
examples which are intended to be only exemplary in nature.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
10047]	A rotor-stator high shear mixer (Silverson L4RT-A) was fitted with a 4<br>
liter stainless steel beaker and was immersed in an ice bath. Approximately 75 g of Pigment Yellow 74 and 1000 g of water were placed into the beaker and the mixture was homogenized for 15 min at 7,200 rpm. To this was added a solution of 2.07 g (0.01 mol) of acetoacet-o-anisidide in 20 mL of isopropanol, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 15 minutes.<br>
[0048]	In a separate vessel, 435 g (0.025 mol) of sulfenilic acid were mixed<br>
with 30 ml 1 N HC1 and 1.73 g (0,025 mol) of sodium nitrite at 5-10 degrees C, forming the corresponding diazonium salt T his was then added to the mixture of Pigment Yellow 74 and acetoacet-o-anisidide, with stirring. The temperature was maintained at approximately 10 degrees C. The mixture was adjusted to a pH of 5-6 by dropwise addition of a 5M sodium hydroxide solution. Mixing was continued for an additional 2 hours. The reaction progress was monitored by removing small portions of the mixture and adding this to a 0,1% aminosalycilic acid solution in 1M Na2CO3 to show the absence of diazonium salt. Thus, a drop of the reaction mixture is placed on a piece of filter paper, and a drop of the aminosalycilic acid solution is placed next to the drop of the reaction mixture. An orange color will form where the runouts of the two drops touch to indicate the presence of diazonium salt in the reaction mixture.<br>
[0049]	The mixture was transferred to a Telsonic flow-through sonicator and<br>
sonicated for 2 hours, to produce an aqueous colored pigment dispersion. The resulting yellow pigment dispersion was purified using a 50 nm diafiltration membrane column and concentrated to solids content of 10%. The median particle size of the bright yellow dispersion was about 170 nm.<br><br>
[005OJ	This example shows an embodiment of the method of the present<br>
invention in which the colored pigment and azo coupler are combined to form a pretreated colored pigment dispersion. The aromatic amine and diazotizing agent are also combined together in an aqueous medium. The resulting aqueous colored pigment dispersion was found to have good properties and, in particular, good particle size. In addition, this colored pigment dispersion was shown to have excellent stability based on results of a four hour fteeze-fhaw cycle test (3,5% pigment in the presence of 20% humectant) as well as in an oven test (60 degrees C for 1 week) and therefore could be used to prepare an inkjet ink composition.<br>

The resulting suspension of diazohium salt was added to a 0.1M solution of Naphthol AS-CA (2 methoxy-5-chloroanilide of 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid) in 100 mL of 1M NaOH mixed with 300 g of ice. Coupling was conducted at pH 5-6, which was maintained by gradual addition of 50 g of solid sodium acetate.<br><br><br>
Compound 2, formed in the reaction, was isolated by centrifugation and recrystallized from isopropanol/water (1/1).<br>
[0055]	Compound 2 (0.2 g) was dissolved in 500 mL of hot water, and the<br>
solution was cooled .down to 25-30 degrees C. Approximately 4 g of Pigment Red 269 (Suribrite Red 435-4438, available from Sun Chemicals Corporation, Cincinnati, OH) was added and the mixture homogenized in a Silverson rotor-stator mixer for 30 minutes.
