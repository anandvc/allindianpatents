Description<br>
Xanthine compounds having terminally aminated alkynol side chains<br>
The invention relates to novel xanthine derivatives having at least one alkynol side chain in position 1 or 7 of the xanthine framework, processes for their preparation and their use as active substances in pharmaceuticals, in particular for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of cerebrovascular disorders characterized by damage caused by ischemia and subsequent necrotic destruction of nerve cells (neurons).<br>
Postishemic neuronal cell death and the fatal functional deficits caused thereby, with correspondingly serious neurological and/or psychological symptoms, are the common clinical picture of a large number of cerebrovascular disorders. These include, for example, stroke; transient ischemic attacks (TIA); multiinfarct dementia, dementia of the mixed type with vascular and degenerative (Alzheimer) components; spinal cord damage; brain trauma as a result of head injuries; and neuronal damage after cardiac arrest, (neonatal) asphyxia and resuscitation, and vascular surgical operations (for example bypass operations) in the region of the main arteries supplying the brain.<br>
In clinical practice it is stroke which predominates, also called cerebrovascular accident, apoplexy, cerebral apoplexia or apoplectic insult. It is the basic cause of about 15% of all deaths (Pschyrembel, Klinisches Wdrterbuch [Clinical Dictionary] Walter de Gruyter-Verlag, 255th edition, 1986, page 105) and is thus in third place after heart disease and cancers in the statistics of the causes of deaths (Pharmazeutische Zeitung 1994,139/31: 2482 - 2483). Women and men are equally affected, there being a drastic increase in morbidity after the 6th decade. The incidence is currently about 0.8% of the world population with a continuous increase in prevalence, especially in industrialized countries because the average life expectancy is continuously increasing there.<br>
If a stroke is survived, it usually leaves behind persistent damage, for example<br><br>
paralysis, speech disturbances and/or convulsions, which make it necessary for the patients to receive continuing intensive care with an enormous burden of suffering, also for the relatives, and an immense burden of costs on the health services. Thus, the cost for the treatment and aftercare of stroke patients in the USA alone is currently estimated at 20 billion US dollars annually. In addition, approximately 10% of all surviving victims of stroke suffer another cerebrovascular accident during the first year thereafter, with a considerably worsened prognosis.<br>
Hence the development and clinical establishment of an effective drug therapy which reduces both the acute mortality and the extent of the neurological deficits and the rate of recurrence, and thus distinctly improves the quality of life after a stroke, represent a huge challenge with social and medical significance for pharmaÂ¬ceutical research.<br>
The cause of stroke is always a disturbance of the circulation, associated with oxygen deficiency, in a localized region of the brain. The signs and symptoms are characterized by disturbances of consciousness as far as coma, frequently spastic hemiplegia, symptoms of a wide variety of central motor and sensory deficits and focal or generalized convulsions. A distinction has to be made in the etiology between cerebral hemorrhage or encephalorrhagia, which is associated with high mortality (initial hemorrhagic insult; about 15% of cases; frequently as massive bleeding) after rupture of a vessel, mainly of the sublenticular arteries as a consequence of hypertension, arteriosclerosis or intracranial aneurysm as basic disorder, and cerebral infarct or encephalomalacia (initial non-hemorrhagic insult; about 85% of cases) with development of an ischemic focus of softening (necrosis) caused either by functional ischemia, inter alia as a result of a hypotensive crisis, usually of cardiac origin, or mainly due to progressive or persistent ischemia resulting from stenosing or obliterating vascular processes of arteriosclerotic, thrombotic and embolic origin in the region of the extra- and/or intracranial arteries, preferentially located in the internal carotid, middle cerebral and vertebral artery. The symptoms of encephalomalacia, which are rare and develop slowly, are referred to as "progressive stroke".<br><br>
Preliminary signs that a cerebrovascular accident is threatening are regarded as being the frequently recurring transient ischemic attacks (TIA) lasting from 2 to 15 minutes with temporary symptoms of neurological deficit, whose origin is a transient, localized disturbance of blood flow caused by stenosis or by microembol-isms, and which resolve within minutes to 24 hours at the most with complete recovery. Effective treatment of these ischemic attacks would therefore be very important for the prophylaxis of stroke.<br>
Epidemiologically confirmed risk factors which favor the development of cerebral ischemias are, for example, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, diabetes mellitus, rheological blood disorders, heart failure and the taking of hormonal contraceptives (Pschyrembel, Klinisches Wdrterbuch [Chemical Dictionary], Walter de Gruyter-Verlag, 255th edition, 1986, page 1840).<br>
The therapy currently applied to cerebrovascular disorders is confined to measures which have no direct effect on the cerebral ischemia (Schweiz. Med. Wochenschr. 1994,124/45: 2005-2012). The only aim of the therapy is to maintain an adequate perfusion in the still intact area on the margin of the ischemic focus in order, at best, to limit the progressive infarction of the brain tissue. A predominant part is played, when the indication is appropriate, by vascular surgical procedures such as intramural desobliteration or the bridging of vascular stenoses by an extra/intracranial bypass, although these are associated with a relatively high operative risk. In particular, the medical procedures available at present do not permit causal treatment; on the contrary they are directed exclusively at eliminating the signs and symptoms. This includes primarily ensuring adequate cardiac function by administration of digitalis glycosides and antiarrhythmics, controlling the blood pressure, eliminating metabolic disturbances, mainly in the electrolyte and glucose balance, and preventing further thrombotic foci by antithrombotic therapy with acetylsalicylic acid or heparin, whereas anticoagulants of the vitamin K antagonist type (coumarins) are contraindicated because of the increased risk of hemorrhage. In addition, elimination of previously known risk factors is also thought to be of therapeutic importance.<br><br>
Acute drug treatment of cerebral ischemia thus represents an as yet unsolved clinical problem (Ann. Radiol. 1994, 37/1-2: 132-135). This is also the conclusion of a recently published critical analysis of all the major clinical therapeutic studies carried out to date (Lancet 1992, 339/8792: 537-539), it being emphasized once again that reducing the mortality and limiting the neurological sequelae in the survivors are criteria of equal importance for assessing the result of treatment.<br>
Clinicians are therefore demanding new therapeutic ideas aimed more at the causes. Promising approaches to this are provided by the complex pathophysiological processes at the vascular and cellular level which, in the form of a vicious circle, are at the basis of the progressive course of the acute cerebral ischemia. According to the current state of knowledge, the pathogenetic path from cellular ischemia and cell death is characterized by a cascade of physiological and biochemical processes involving a large number of mediator systems, which starts with deficient supply, consumption of high-energy compounds and collapse of energy metabolism, and leads, via excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and aspartate, with limited or absent reuptake, to the pathological increase in concentration of intracellular calcium which is mainly responsible for the cytotoxicity. The fatal disturbance of calcium homeostasis goes hand in hand with other deleterious processes to contribute to the loss of cellular integrity. These include, inter alia, activation of membrane-associated phospholipases and the arachidonic acid metabolism, with formation of free fatty acids and their breakdown by the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase reaction pathways to prostaglandins and leukotrienes as mediators of inflammation, the production of aggressive oxygen free radicals with pronounced potential for damage to cell membranes, a drastic rise in membrane permeability, the development of vasogenic and cytotoxic cerebral edemas and the proteolysis, triggered by calcium ions, of protein structures intrinsic to the cell. Since all these mechanisms are time-dependent, there is a latency period between the occurrence of the ischemia and the death of cells of about 6 to a maximum of 12 hours, and medical interventions can have prospects of success only in this time window, if at all (Rev. Med. Interne 1994, 15/5: 350-356).<br><br>
Attempts at new causal therapies are now concentrated on intervening specifically in the pathogenetic reaction cascade to interrupt, as soon as possible, the progressÂ¬ive course of the acute cerebral ischemia, and thus permanently to control the postischemic neuronal cell loss. At present, essentially two strategies are being followed (Stroke 1990, 21/8 Suppl. 1:1-130 -1-131); on the one hand, thrombolysis of thromboembolic and atherothrombotic blockages with fibrinolytics such as streptokinase, urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator r-tPA, with the aim of early rechannelization of the arterial system and, on the other hand, cytoprotection aimed at the survival of the neurons under ischemic conditions.<br>
The neuroprotective therapeutic principles which have been intensively investigated, particularly by pharmacologists but, in some cases, also already by clinicians include, for example, suppression of the neuronal calcium influx with calcium antagonists (for example nimodipine, nicardipine, flunarizine and levemopamil), EAA (excitatory amino acid) antagonists (for example competitive and non-competitive NMDA (N-methyI-D-aspartate) and non-NMDA antagonists), or gangliosides (for example GM-1); blockade of the arachidonic acid cascade and elimination of its harmful metabolic products with phospholipase, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors or PAF (platelet-activating factor), thromboxane and leukotriene antagonists; inhibition of the lipid peroxidation which damages cell membranes using oxygen free radical scavengers (for example superoxide dismutase, catalase, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, ginkgo leaves, allopurinol, tirilazad and melatonin) or heavy metal chelators (for example deferoxamine); limiting the spread of edema with antiedematous active substances (for example corticosteroids); reducing the tendency to thrombosis with anticoagulants (for example heparin) and platelet aggregation inhibitors (for example ASA, ticlopidine, prostacyclins and its more stable synthetic derivatives); and assisting endogenous protective factors with serotonin 1A agonists (for example urapidil and ipsapirone), adenosine modulators (for example propentofylline and vinpocetine) or neurotrophic growth factors (for example transforming growth factor TGF-pi and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and their release activators (Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry 1993, 17/1: 21-70; Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1990, 13 Suppl 3: S9-S25). The greatest prospects of success in this are, of course, ascribed to a<br><br>
multifactorial intervention in the pathogenetic reaction cascade with its complex network of mutually amplifying mediator systems (Drugs 1988, 35/4: 468-476), whether by combining different selectively acting drugs or, more advantageously, by a single drug with the widest possible spectrum of pharmacological effects.<br>
Besides propentofylline (3-methyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-7-propylxanthine) which has already been mentioned, there have been investigations by pharmacologists to a greater or lesser extent and, in most cases, also by clinicians, of other xanthines, such as the methylxanthines theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine), theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine and caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) which are widespread in nature, and the synthetic 1,3,7-trialkyl derivatives pentoxifylline (3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)xanthine; Drugs &amp; Aging 1995, 7/6: 480-503) and denbufylline (1,3-dibutyl-7-(2-oxopropyl)xanthine), without a clear therapeutic benefit having been detectable hitherto in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke. On the contrary, the natural methylxanthines may in fact lead to a deterioration in the clinical situation (Schweiz. Rundsch. Med. Prax. 1989, 78/23: 663-666) and have therefore been said to be contraindicated. Only propentofylline appears to occupy a certain position as an exception, because of its exclusive profile of pharmacological effects, however (Gen. Pharmac. 1994, 25/6:1053-1058; Drug. Dev. Res. 1993, 28/3: 438-444), although further controlled clinical studies with a sufficiently large number of patients are required in order to be able reliably to assess the therapeutic value of the product (J. Cereb. Blood. Flow Metab. 1993,13/3: 526-530).<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that introduction of alkynol side chains with terminal amino functionality into position 1 and/or 7 of the xanthine framework results in compounds which, in clinically relevant experimental models, are distinctly superior to propentofylline and therefore have a greater therapeutic potential for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebrovascular disorders.<br>

morpholine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, 4-methylpiperazine or 4-acetylpiperazine<br>
ring, A       is unbranched (C2-C4)-alkylene, and Z~      is the anion of a physiologically tolerated inorganic or organic acid.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds are 1-(8-diethylamino-5-hydroxy-5-methyl-6-octynyl)-3-methyl-, 1 -(5-hydroxy-5-methyl-8-pyrrolidino-6-octynyl)-3-methyl-, 3-butyl-1 -(5-hydroxy-6-methyl-8-piperidino-6-octynyl)-, 1 -(5-diethylamino-2-hydroxy-2-me-thyl-3-pentynyl)-3-propyl-, 1-(6-dimethylamino-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-4-hexynyl)-3-ethyl-, 1 -(7-diethylamino-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-5-heptynyl)-3-ethyl-, 1 -[8-(4-acetylpiperazino)-5-hydroxy-5-methyl-6-octynyl]-3-methyl-7-propylxanthine and their physiologically tolerated acid addition salts and N,N-diethyl-N-[4-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-(3-methyl-7-propyl-1-xanthinyl)-2-octynyl]-N-methylammonium iodide.<br>
The term "(C4-C8)-cycloalkylalkyl" defines those alkyl radicals which are substituted by (C3-C6)-cycloalkyl with the total of all the carbon atoms being less than or equal to 8. These include, for example, cyclopropylmethyl to -pentyl, cyclobutylmethyl to -butyl, cyclopentylmethyl to -propyl and cyclohexylmethyl und -ethyl radicals. "Ar" designates radicals which are derived from benzene or naphthalene. Suitable 4- to 7-membered saturated rings for the structural element -NR5R6 are, for example, 4-(C1-C4)-alkylpiperazine, azetidine, 2,5-dimethylpyrrolidine, 2,6-dimethylpiperidine, morpholine, perhydroazepine (azepane), piperazine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, thiomorpholine and its sulfoxide or sulfone.<br>
Suitable for forming the physiologically tolerated acid addition and quaternary<br><br>
ammonium salts of the formula I with the structural element of the formula lb are, inter alia, hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, lactic, maleic, fumaric, oxalic, tartaric, citric, D-gluconic, 4-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic and cyclohexylsulfamic acids or their particular anion Z~.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention always have a center of chirality, because of the secondary or tertiary alcohol structure in the alkynol residue of the formula la or lb, and thus exist in enantiomeric forms. In addition, where the alkyl radical is asymmetrically branched in positions R2 and/or R5 to R8 and/or where the alkylene group A is asymmetrically branched, further asymmetric carbons are present so that the compounds of the formula I now occur in diastereomeric forms. The invention therefore embraces not only all the stereoisomerically pure compounds, but also their mixtures.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for preparing the compounds of the formula I. In process variant A, a 3-alkylxanthine of the formual II,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
by a Mannich reaction with formaldehyde and an amine of the formula X in analogy to process variant B to give a compound of the formula ic, Id, le, If or Ig.<br>
In process variant E, a compound of the formula Ic, Id, le or If prepared in process variants A to D, or a compound of the formula Ig prepared in process variants C or D, in which R5 and/or R6 are each a hydrogen atom, is reductively alkylated once or twice with an oxo derivative (aldehyde or ketone) of (C1-C6)alkanes, (C3-C6)cycloalkanes, (C4-C8)cycloalkylalkanes or Ar-(CrC2)a!kanes.<br>
In process variant F, a compound prepared in process variants A to E is converted with a physiologically tolerated inorganic or organic acid HZ into an acid addition salt of the formula I, where R1 and/or R3 are the alkynol residue of the formula lb, in which R7 is a hydrogen atom and R2 is as defined in formula I.<br>
In process variant G, a compound prepared in process variants A to E is converted with an alkylating agent of the formula VII,<br>
R7-Z	(VII)<br>
where R7 is as defined in formula I with the exception of hydrogen, and Z is as defined in formula III for X, into a quaternary ammonium salt of the formula I, where R1 and/or R3 are the alkynol residue of the formula lb and R2 is as defined in formula I.<br>
In process variant H, a compound prepared in process variants A to G is fractionated into the pure stereoisomers by chromatography or by fractional crystallization.<br>
The xanthines of the formula II, V, VI or XI, alkylating agents of the formula III, IV, VII or VIII; organometallic compounds of the formula XII, XIII or XIV and amines of the formula X used as starting materials in process variants A to D are known or can be prepared by known methods.<br>
Thus, the alkynols of the formula III with basic substituents can be obtained, for example, by organometallic synthesis by reacting the sterically unhindered halo aldehydes or halo ketones of the formula Hal-A-CO-R4 in a buildup reaction with<br><br>
reductive alkynylation of the carbonyl functionality with the 2-propynylamine metal compounds of the formula XII (R5R6N-CH2-CÂ»C-M), preferably in the form of the lithium or halomagnesium (Grignard) compounds, under standard conditions (as described in detail hereinafter for process variants C and D). Similar reaction of the halo aldehydes and halo ketones with acetylides of the formula XIII (HC=C-M) or XIV (Ra-C=C-M) results, after elimination of the protective group Ra on use of XIV, in the alkynols of the formula VIII.<br>
The 2-propynylamines (R5R6N-CH2-C*CH) on which the organometallic compounds of the formula XII are based can be synthesized without difficulty from 2-propynyl bromide and the amines of the formula X by direct halogen/amine exchange or by the indirect route via the metal amides produced as intermediates in the following one-pot reaction which is disclosed in the literature (Tetrahedron 1992, 48/30: 6231 - 6244):<br><br>
Reaction of the mono- and disubstituted xanthine derivatives II or Ic, Ig, V, VI and IX with the relevant reagents of the formula III, IV or VIII normally takes place in a dispersant or solvent which is inert towards the reactants. Particularly suitable ones are dipolar aprotic solvents, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, tetramethylurea. hexamethvlDhosphoric triamide or dimethyl<br><br>
sulfoxide; however, it is also possible to use formamide, acetonitrile, acetone, butanone or alcohols such as methanol, ethylene glycol and its mono- and di(C1-C4)alkyl ethers, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol and the various butanols; hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylenes; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane or chloroform; pyridine and mixtures of said solvents or mixtures thereof with water.<br>
The reaction is expediently carried out in the presence of a basic condensing agent. Suitable for this purpose are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrides, alcoholates and organic bases such as trialkylamines, for example triethyl- or tributylamine, quaternary ammonium or phosphonium hydroxides and crosslinked resins with attached, optionally substituted ammonium or phosphonium groups. However, the xanthine derivatives can also be employed directly in the form of their separately prepared salts, for example the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium or phosphonium salts. Furthermore, the xanthine compounds can be alkylated without difficulty both in the presence of the abovementioned inorganic condensing agents and in the form of their alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts with the assistance of phase transfer catalysts, for example tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts or else crown ethers, preferably in a two-phase system under the conditions of phase transfer catalysis. Suitable phase transfer catalysts, most of which are commercially available, are, inter alia, tetra-(CrC4)-alkyl- and methyltrioctylammonium and -phosphonium, methyl-, myristyl-, phenyl-and benzyl-tri-(C,-C4)-alkyl- and cetyltrimethylammonium or (Cj-C^-alkyl- and benzyltriphenylphosphonium salts, the compounds which prove more effective being, as a rule, those having the larger cation of more symmetric structure. The reaction temperatures for this are generally between 0Â°C and the boiling point of the reaction medium used in each case, preferably between 20Â°C and 130X, where appropriate under elevated or reduced pressure, but usually under atmospheric pressure, in which case the reaction time can be from less than one hour up to several hours.<br>
The optional reductive alkylation of compounds of the formulae Ic to Ig with terminal primary (R5 and R6 = H) or secondary (R5 or R6 = H) amino group in the alkynol<br><br>
side chain to give secondary or tertiary amines takes place by reaction with one of the oxo derivatives (aldehydes or ketones), which are all known from the literature, of (CrC6)alkanes, (C3-C6)cycloalkanes, (C4-C8)cycloalkylalkanes or Ar(Cr C2)alkanes in the presence of a suitable reducing agent. The azomethines which are formed as intermediates from oxo compound and amine are reduced, for example, with formic acid and derivatives thereof; however, hydrogenation with complex metal hydrides such as lithium alanate, lithium or sodium boranate and, in particular, sodium cyanoboranate, is preferred. This is expediently carried out in a dispersant or solvent which is inert towards the reactants, for example an ether such as diethyl ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran; a lower alcohol, preferably methanol or ethanol; water or mixtures thereof with one another at temperatures between 20Â°C and the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
Conversion of the xanthine Ic to Ig with the acids HZ into the physiologically tolerated acid addition salts may be carried out using methods well known in the art. The preparation of the physiologically tolerated quaternary ammonium salts from the xanthines Ic to Ig by alkylation with the reagents of the formula VII, preferably in the form of alkyl halides (R7Hal), in particular the iodides R7I, or dialkyl sulfates (R72S04), is expediently carried out in inert dispersions or solvents such as di(Cr C4)alkyl ethers, cyclic ethers, aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons or ketones (for example acetone), or else in mixtures of these solvents or with addition of dipolar aprotic solvents (for example dimethylformamide) at temperatures from 20Â°C to the boiling point of the relevant reaction medium, several hours frequently being needed until the reaction is complete. This usually results in the quaternary salts in crystalline form. If required, their anion Z" can subsequently be varied as required with the aid of anion exchangers.<br>
The Mannich three-component condensation for aminomethylation (Weygand/Hilgetag: Organisch-chemische Experimentierkunst, [Experiments in organic chemistry] 4th edition, 1970, pages 990-993) of compound IX at the terminal acetylene group with acidic CH can in principle be carried out with ammonia, primary or, preferably, secondary amines of the formula X in the presence of formaldehyde as carbonyl component (employed either in aqueous solution or,<br><br>
advantageously, in solid form as paraformaldehyde) under the catalytic influence both of bases and of acids. However, the acid-catalyzed process is preferred, in which the amines X are reacted in the form of their salts, for example the hydrochlorides or acetates. It is often appropriate to add catalytic amounts of metal salts such as, for example, zinc(ll), iron(lll) or, in particular, copper(l) chloride (J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33: 3182 - 3189).<br>
In general, lower alcohols, di-(CrC4)alkyl ethers or, preferably, cyclic ethers, especially dioxane, are used as reaction medium. The reaction temperature is usually between 20Â°C and the boiling point of the reaction mixture, preferably between 30Â°C and 70Â°C, with reaction times of up to several hours being usual.<br>
The 3-alkylated mono- or dioxoalkylxanthines of the formula XI which are employed as starting materials in the organometailic reactions in process variants C and D are mostly known, inter alia from the German publications D-A 23 30742 and D-A 24 02908, or can easily be prepared from the mono- or dialkylxanthines of the formula II and V or VI and the halo aldehydes or halo ketones of the formula Hal-A-CO-R4, where appropriate also in the form of their open-chain or cyclic acetals or ketals, under the alkylation conditions which have been described in detail hereinbefore. Moreover, those compounds XI which have a hydrogen atom in the position of R12 and an oxalkyl radical of the formula Xla and the position of R11 can be obtained without difficulty by the alternative route via 1-oxoalkyl-3,7-dialkylxanthines in which the alkyl radical in position 7 is a leaving group which can easily be eliminated, for example in the form of the benzyl group which can be removed by reduction or the meth-, eth-, prop- or butoxymethyl radical which can be eliminated by hydrolysis, by the method described in detail in WO 87/00523.<br>
Among the organometailic compounds of the formula XII, XIII or XIV suitable for alkynylation of the carbonyl groups, the lithium and halomagnesium (Grignard) derivatives occupy a preferred position because they are easy to obtain and manipulate. Thus, the 2-propynylamines of the formula R5R6N-CH2-OCH described hereinbefore, and the acetylenes of the formula Ra-OCH which are protected at one end, preferably ethynyltrimethylsilane, can be metallated with (Cr C4)alkyllithium compounds, preferably butyllithium, in one of the solvents listed hereinafter, mainly anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, at low temperatures between -50Â°C<br><br>
and -80Â°C or with(CrC4)alkylmagnesium halides, for example methyl- or ethylmagnesium chloride or bromide, in a low-boiling ether, as a rule diethyl ether, at the boiling point, quantitatively to give compounds of the formula XII or XIV, which are reacted without intermediate isolation with the carbonyl compounds XI. It is possible and advantageous to employ as reagent of the formula XIII commerically obtainable lithium acetylide m the form of the stable ethylenediamine complex, and addition of dry cerium(lll) chloride in at least the stoichiometric amount is recommended to increase the reactivity (Tetrahedron Letters 1984,25/38:4233 -4236). The highly nucleophilic organometallic compounds are very sensitive to hydrolysis and oxidation; safe handling thereof therefore requires rigorous exclusion of moisture and, where appropriate, use of a protective gas atmosphere. The usual solvents or dispersants for the alkynylation reaction are mainly those which are also suitable for preparing the organometallic compounds. Particularly suitable as such are ethers with one or more ether oxygen atoms, for example diethyl, dipropyl, diisopropyl or dibutyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, tetrahydropyran, furan and anisole, and aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as petroleum ether, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylenes, diethylbenzenes and tetrahydronaphthalene; however, it is also possible to use tertiary amines such as triethylamine, or dipolar aprotic solvents, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, and mixtures of said solvents.<br>
The alkynylation reaction is, as a rule, carried out at temperatures between -40Â°C and +100Â°C, preferably between -20Â°C and +70Â°C or at room temperature without external cooling, with the particular organometallic compound normally being used in slight excess. The reaction times usually extend from a few minutes up to several hours. The alcoholates which are formed are preferably decomposed with water, aqueous ammonium chloride solution or dilute hydrochloric or acetic acid.<br>
The desilylation both of the alkynols protected on the ethynyl moiety and obtained from the carbonyl compounds XI by reaction with lithium trimethylsilylacetylide (XIV) to give the intermediate compounds of the formula IX, and of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention with N-trialkylsiiylated alkynol side chains can advantageously be carried out by methanolysis in the presence of catalytic amounts<br><br>
of potassium fluoride, which takes place quantitatively within a few hours at temperatures between 20Â°C and the boiling point of the methanol.<br>
Compounds I according to the invention can be prepared in stereoisomerically pure form either by starting from sterically homogeneous starting materials of the formula III or VIII (where appropriate also II, IV, V, VI, VII, X and/or XI) and intermediate compounds of the formula IX, or in process variants C and D by designing the alkynol formation from the prochiral carbonyl compounds XI with the organometallic compounds XII, XIII or XIV to be enantioselective by asymmetric induction in the presence of chiral auxiliaries.<br>
However, it is preferred for the stereoisomeric forms to be separated subsequently by methods known per se. Since diastereomers have, in contrast to enantiomers, different physical and chemical properties, as a rule there are no difficulties in separating mixtures thereof, for example by fractional crystallization or by chromatographic processes. By contrast, physical racemate resolution into the enantiomeric forms (antipodes) requires additional measures; thus, fractional crystallization is possible only after formation of diastereomeric salts with an optically active acid HZ and chromatographic separation is preferably only on use of chiral stationary phases which show different spatial affinity for the enantiomers.<br>
The alkynols of the formula IX not only are valuable intermediates for synthesizing the compounds of the formula I according to the invention, but, in addition, themselves show the same type of pharmacological effects as the final products of the formula I, although they are less soluble in water.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are suitable, because of their valuable pharmacological properties, in an outstanding manner for use as active substances in pharmaceuticals, in particular in those which permit effective curative and prophylactic treatment of cerebrovascular disorders caused by ischemia, such as stroke; transient ischemic attacks (TIA); multiinfarct dementia; dementia of the mixed type with vascular and degenerative (Alzheimer) components; spinal cord damage; brain trauma as a result of head injuries; and neuronal damage after cardiac arrest, (neonatal) asphyxia and resuscitation, and vascular surgical operations (for<br><br>
example bypass operations) in the region of the main arteries supplying the brain. It is moreover possible for the compounds of the formula I to be administered either on their own, for example in the form of microcapsules, in mixtures with one another or in combination with suitable excipients.<br>
The invention accordingly also relates to pharmaceuticals which comprise at least one compound of the formula I as active substance.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates, on the one hand, to the use of the pharmaceuticals according to the invention in all types of therapy currently practiced for cerebrovascular disorders (Schweiz. Med. Wochenschr. 1994,124/45: 2005-2012), such as primary prevention for suppressing the threat of ischemic attacks, acute treatment to limit the infarction of the tissue after onset of ischemia and secondary prophylaxis to reduce the rate of recurrence after an ischemic episode and, on the other hand, to the use of the pharmaceuticals in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, in particular for parenteral and oral, but also rectal or transdermal where appropriate, administration.<br>
Suitable solid or liquid pharmaceutical forms are, for example, granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, gels, products with protracted release of active substance, suppositories, plasters which release the active substance, aerosols, drops and, in particular, injectible solutions in the form of ampoules or injection bottles for continuous infusion, in the production of which auxiliaries such as excipients, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are normally used. Examples of auxiliaries which are frequently used and which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, lactose, gelatin, starch, vitamins, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols and solvents such as, for example, sterile water, physiological saline, alcohols, glycerol and other polyhydric alcohols (polyols).<br>
The pharmaceutical products are preferably produced and administered in dosage<br><br>
units, each unit containing as active ingredient a particular dose of the compound of the formula I. In the case of solid dosage units such as tablets, capsules and suppositories, this dose can be up to 1000 mg, but preferably 100 to 600 mg, and in the case of injection solutions in ampoule form up to 300 mg, but preferably 20 to 200 mg.<br>
The daily dosages indicated for treating an adult patient are, depending on the activity of the compounds of the formula I in humans and the severity of the life-threatening disorder, from 100 to 5000 mg of active substance, preferably 300 to 3000 mg, on oral administration and from 30 to 3000 mg, preferably 50 to 2000 mg, on intravenous administration. The daily dose can be administered either by a single administration in the form of a single dosage unit or as a plurality of smaller dosage units and by multiple administration of divided doses at particular intervals of time. The daily dose on continuous intravenous infusion is 100 to 5000 mg, preferably 500 to 2000 mg, corresponding to an infusion rate of from 0.1 to 3 mg per kg of body weight and hour (h), preferably from 0.3 to 1 mg/kg/h. However, in certain circumstances, higher or lower daily doses may also be appropriate with all administration forms.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can also be administered with other suitable active substances, in particular with those which likewise intervene to control the pathogenetic reaction cascade of acute cerebral ischemia; for example with fibrinolytics, calcium antagonists, EAA (excitatory amino acids) antagonists, gangliosides, phospholipase, cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors, PAF (platelet-activating factor), thromboxane and leukotriene antagonists, oxygen free radical scavengers, heavy metal chelators, antiedematous active substances, anticoagulants, platelet application inhibitors, serotonin 1A agonists, adenosine modulators or neurotrophic growth factors and their release activators; or be formulated together with them in the production of the pharmaceutical forms.<br>
The synthesis of the compounds of the formula I which are summarized by structural aspects in Table 1 is explained in detail hereinafter by means of representative preparation examples. Table 2 is a compilation of the compounds of the formula IX.<br><br>
The structure of all the intermediates and final products produced by preparation was verified both by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and by elemental analysis or mass spectrum.<br>

1.       Neuroprotective effect in the model of transient global ischemia in gerbils To carry out the experiment, which took place in accordance with the provisions of the German Animal Protection Act, 30 male Mongolian gerbils weighing between 60 and 70 g were distributed at random between two groups each of 15 animals. The animals in the first group received the particular test substance by intraperitoneal injection 30 minutes after the ischemic period, while the animals in the second group, which served as untreated control group, merely received the same volume of the relevant vehicle.<br>
To produce the temporary forebrain ischemia , the animals were anesthetized with halothane and fixed supine on a heated operating stage, and both common carotid arteries were cautiously exposed and closed for 3 minutes using microaneurysm clips (J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987, 7/1: 74 - 81). 7 Days after the 3-minute ischemic period, the animals were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated, the brains were rapidly and carefully removed, first immersion-fixed in Carnoy's solution (ethanol/chloroform/acetic acid 6:3: 1) and then embedded in paraffin, and subsequently coronal sections 4 to 6 urn thick through the hippocampus approximately at the level of the bregma were produced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Then, in a blind test, the extent of the eosinophilic necroses of the pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was determined under the light microscope using a semiquantitative histopathological score (0 = none; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe and 4 = complete necroses). The quantity used for assessing the neuroprotective effect was the percentage change in the average histopathological score in the product group compared with that for the untreated control group. The experimental results are compiled in Table 3.<br><br>

2.       Inhibitory effect on neurological symptoms in the model of permanent focal<br>
cerebral ischemia in rats The experimental animals were adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 to 400 g with a focal cerebral infarct produced experimentally by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)(J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1981,1: 53-60).<br>
The surgical preparation took about 20 to 30 minutes and was performed under anesthesia with nitrous oxide containing 1 to 1.2% halothane, which was admixed with the air breathed through a gas mask with spontaneous breathing. After catheterization of the right femoral artery and vein for measuring the blood pressure, taking blood samples and later administering the test substance, the occlusion of the left MCA was brought about under powerful magnification by a surgical microscope, via the subtemporal access without removing the zygomatic arch and temporal muscles, by electrocoagulation and subsequent vessel severance, the progress of the operation being monitored by continuous recording of the average arterial blood pressure by means of an electromechanical pressure transducer (Model 7E Polygraph; Grass, USA). After the operation, the animals were allowed to recover from the anesthesia and their body temperature was maintained in the normal range around 37Â°C using a homeothermic heating drape (Homeothermic Blanket System; Harvard Apparatus, UK).<br>
15 minutes after the vessel occlusion, the animals in the product group (n = 8) received the test substance administered in the form of an intraperitoneal bolus injection of 10 mg/kg as initial dose and continued treatment by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min through the venous catheter using a special, freely rotatable turnbuckle system (Harvard Apparatus, UK), while the animals in the untreated control group (n = 7) received only the vehicle (physiological saline) by the same route. 15 minutes before and immediately after the vessel occlusion,<br><br>
and shortly after the start of the continuous infusion of the test product or of the vehicle, the arterial blood gases and the pH (178 pH/blood gas analyzer; Corning, USA) and the hematocrit and blood glucose level were checked to detect physiological irregularities; it was then possible to remove the arterial catheter. In addition, the temperature of the temporal muscles on both sides (Therm 2250-1; Ahlborn MeG- und Regeltechnik, FRG), and the rectal body temperature, were measured from the start of the operation up to 10 minutes after the start of the continuous infusion and for a few minutes before the end of the experiment. 24 hours after the vessel occlusion, the continuous infusion was stopped, and the extent of the neurological deficit caused by the ischemia was determined using the four-point symptom scale of Bederson et al. (Stroke 1986, 17: 422 - 476) with the following assessment criteria:<br>
0	=     no signs of neurological deficits;<br>
1	=     front extremities held flexed;<br>
2	=     diminished resistance to a push from the side without moving in a circle;<br>
3	=     same symptoms as for 2, but with moving in a circle.<br>

3.       Neuroprotective effect on the model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia in<br>
rats The experimental design very substantially corresponded to the method described in Experiment 2. The product and control groups comprised n = 6 animals in each case. However, dispensing with the rather complicated continuous intravenous infusion on the conscious animal, the test substances were administered entirely intraperitoneally, specifically by three administrations of 10 mg/kg in each case at intervals of 15 minutes, 3 and 6 hours after the surgical MCA occlusion. After the<br><br>
experiment had lasted 24 hours, the animals were decapitated under anesmesia, the brains were rapidly and carefully removed and frozen at -10Â°C for 10 minutes, and subsequently the forebrains were sliced into 8 coronal sections in defined planes, the sections being stained by the cresyl staining technique. Then, in a blind experiment, the infarcted areas, which could not be stained, of the coronal sections were transferred onto a graph and measured by planimetry, and the infarct volume in the left cerebral hemisphere which was affected by the ischemia was determined by integration of all the areas (Neurosci. Lett. 1992,147: 41 - 44). The significance (level

mice In this experimental design, the effect of the compounds of the formula I, compared with that of propentofylline as reference substance, on the necrotic damage to the surface of the cerebral cortex after permanent occlusion of the right MCA was investigated as representing a reliable measure of the infarct volume (J. Pharmacol. Methods 1992, 27:27-32).<br>
The experimental animals were male Swiss CD1 mice with a body weight between 33 and 40 g, whose right MCA was occluded by a surgical intervention in analogy to Experiment 2 under chloral hydrate anesthesia (400 mg/kg i.p.). Four mice were subjected to a sham operation in which the MCA was exposed in the same way but not occluded; these animals formed the control group intended to quantify any effect<br><br>
of the surgical operation on the damage to nerve cells. Since both anesthesia and ischemia usually induce hypothermia, which may lead to a reduction in the infarct size (Brain Res. 1992, 587: 66 - 72), the temporal muscle temperature was kept in the normal range around 37Â°C during the surgical manipulation using a halogen heating lamp, as was the body temperature throughout the experiment by appropriate adjustment of the ambient temperature. 5 minutes and 3 and 6 hours after the MCA occlusion, the particular test substance, dissolved in distilled water, was administered to the animals in the product group (n = 12) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/kg in each case, while the animals in the placebo group (n = 12) received only the vehicle, and the mice in the control group (n = 4) received neither product nor vehicle. 24 hours after the vessel occlusion, the animals were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia, and the brains were removed and stained within 30 to 40 minutes in 2% strength aqueous 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution at 37Â°C. The cerebral cortex was then isolated from the right hemisphere, and the infarct area, which was not stainable by TTC, was measured by image analysis (BIOCOM). Statistical analysis of the experimental results took place with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests. It emerged from this that virtually no necroses occurred in the cortex of the mice in the control group with the sham operation, whereas the vehicle-treated animals in the placebo group showed significant neuronal damage resulting from the focal ischemia, with an infarct area of 31.3 Â±1.7 mm2 (average Â± SD; p = 0.0002).<br>
It was possible to reduce this damage significantly by 38% to 19.3 Â± 1.5 mm2 (average Â± SD; p = 0.0001) using the compound of Example 1, whereas a damage limitation of only 20%, to 25.2 Â± 2.1 mm2 (average Â± SD; p = 0.0153), was achieved with propentofylline as comparison product. Since the difference between the two product groups was also statistically significant, with p
