DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE REFFERED EMBODIMENT<br>
Magnet Frame:<br>
The high permeability steel magnet frame (19) is machined to ensure alignment of<br>
the end shields (28), pole bores and axle ways. The nose of the motor is supported in<br>
the bogie with resilient rubber-steel sandwich mounting. The end shields (28) are<br><br>
(4)<br>
spigotted into frame with slight interference fit and held in position by means of bolts<br>
suitably locked. This method of mounting ensures that the fit between the end shield<br>
and the frame can withstand all the heavy jerks and vibration from the railway tracks<br>
and remains tight in service. Roller bearings are provided and labyrinths are formed to<br>
prevent the escape of lubricating grease or the entry of dirt or moisture. Overall length<br>
has been optimized to meet the requirement of meter gauge and cape gauge fitment.<br>
The frame has been specially modified on the axleway side to accommodate the flanges<br>
of the suspension tube assembly has to be accommodated on the locomotive axle within<br>
the two road wheel hubs of the locomotive.<br>
Armature:<br>
The armature core is built from electrical quality low loss sheet steel laminations<br>
insulated from each other and assembled on the shaft (26) with interference fit and<br>
consolidated under pressure. The laminations are held together between endplates,<br>
fitted on the shaft machined from nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel bar hardened &amp;<br>
tempered.<br>
The armature is lap wound. The armature conductors are insulated with Kapton and<br>
mica based Class "H" Insulation system. The coils are held down in the core slots with<br>
epoxy glass laminated slot wedges, and Res-l-glass bands retain in the end portions of<br>
the coils. The wound armature is finally vacuum pressure impregnated in solvent less<br>
polyesterimide varnish. Armature end plate is redesigned with solid base plate and vent<br>
holes aligned with the vent holes of the core assembly, for better cooling and strength.<br><br>
(5)<br>
Epoxy glass slot wedges are provided for extra strength. Special commuter hub<br>
designed for increased ventilation.<br>
Commutator:<br>
The commutator is of arch bound construction. The copper segments are made from<br>
hard drawn silver bearing copper and risers integral with segments are slotted to receive<br>
the armature coil leads. The armature coil leads are finally TIG welded to commutator<br>
risers.<br>
The copper segments which are insulated from each other with the micanite segments,<br>
are held together with the Steel "V" rings, insulated with the moulded micanite V-rings.<br>
The exposed surface of the commutator front micanite v-ring is covered with PTFE bush<br>
to obtain high creepage and for ease in maintenance. Arcing horns are provided to<br>
minimze the damage to the commutator and brush gear in the event of flashover.<br>
Poles and Field Coils:<br>
The poles are built up from steel laminations riveted together. The main field coils<br>
(18) are made of copper strap wound on flat, whereas the compole coils are edge<br>
wound. The coils are insulated with Class "H" insulating materials and vacuum pressure<br>
impregnated in solventless polyesterimide varnish.<br>
Brush Gear:<br>
There are four brush arms, each carrying a brush holder with two carbon brushes.<br>
Twin-stud insulators secure brush holders. PTFE bushes are mounted on the stud<br>
insulators in between each portion and the brush holder provides a creepage surface for<br>
ease in cleaning<br><br>
(6)<br>
Gears and Gearcases:<br>
The transmission to the locomotive axle consists of a single reduction gear unit, the<br>
pinion (27) of which is shrink-fit on to the motor armature shaft (26) and the gear is<br>
mounted directly on the locomotive axle.<br>
The gear is housed in a gearcase (25) mounted on the motor which is made in two<br>
halves bolted together. The joint between the halves has an overlap and felt wipers are<br>
also provided to prevent contamination of the gear lubricant with dirt or moisture.<br>
The new design of gear and pinion set is with 18:93 gear ratio for higher haulage<br>
capacity. Gear case mounting has been modified. Top gearcase mounting has been<br>
changed from horizontal position to vertical position for higher rigidity of fitment of<br>
gearcase on traction motor. Opening on motor end of gearcase has been increased to<br>
accommodated the enclosure.<br>
Axle Suspension Bearings:<br>
Locomotive axle is supported on an axle suspension-bearing unit (32,33) consisting<br>
of taper roller bearings at the ends housed in suspension tube, which is bolted to the<br>
traction motor magnet frame. Suspension tube requires less maintenance during service.<br>
Armature Bearings:<br>
The bearing assemblies (32,33) are of sealed type provided with adequate<br>
labyrinths to avoid the contamination of the lubricating grease with dirt, moisture and<br>
cardium compound.<br><br>
(7)<br>
VENTILATION:<br>
The forced ventilation is from a ducting system on the locomotive connected to the<br>
motor through flexible bellows at the commutator end of the frame.<br>
The cooling air flows in two parallel paths, one under the commutator and though<br>
armature core ducts and the other along the outside of the armature and between the<br>
field coils and escape to the atmosphere through the openings provided on the pinion<br>
end of the frame.<br>
The traction motor according to the invention, whose constructional features are<br>
described above, is suitable<br>
