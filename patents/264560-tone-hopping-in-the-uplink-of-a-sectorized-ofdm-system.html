				<td>TONE HOPPING IN THE UPLINK OF A SECTORIZED OFDM SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION;<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to communications systems and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for allocating tones, e.g., in a cellular communications network.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
[0002]     In a cellular wireless system, a service area is divided into a number of coverage zones generally referred to as cells. Each cell may be further subdivided into a number of sectors. Wireless terminals in a cell communicate with the base station that serves the cell. Wireless terminals may include a wide range of mobile devices including, e.g., cell phones and other mobile transmitters such as personal data assistants with wireless modems.<br>
[0003]    A problem with known cellular communications systems is that transmission by wireless devices in one sector of a cell may collide with transmissions by wireless devices in an adjacent sector of the same cell or in a neighboring cell. For example, orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) systems take a given bandwidth and splits it into a number of evenly spaced tones that can be used to transmit data. When transmissions by devices in overlapping sectors and/or cells use the same tone or set of tones, multiple collisions may occur over a period of time due to the operation of devices in adjacent sectors and/or neighboring cells. This problem is particularly noticeable where transmissions are periodic or nearly periodic.<br>
[0004]     In periodic or nearly periodic situations, mutual interference caused by wireless terminals in adjacent sectors and/or cells may be highly correlated. For example, when a tone assigned to a wireless terminal A corresponding to a first sector is the same as a tone of another wireless terminal B corresponding to an adjacent sector, in<br>
the next transmission period, the tone of wireless terminal A will again be the same as wireless terminal B in the case where the tones are assigned using the same function and recur periodically. Correlated interference of this type can cause signals transmitted by the same two wireless terminals to repeatedly interfere with each other over a long period of time. If the two interfering wireless terminals are disadvantageously located, e.g. in a boundary region between two adjacent sectors, the base station's receivers for each sector may not be able to detect the signals correctly from the two interfering wireless terminals for a long period of time.<br>
[0005] In order to reduce the risk of correlated or prolonged interference it would be beneficial if it was possible to assign tones to devices in neighboring sectors and cells in a manner that would minimize the risk of correlated interference.<br>
[0006]     Some approaches use a cell identifier in controlling the hopping sequence used by mobiles. The mobile may detect the cell identifier and then use it in a hopping equation to control uplink hopping. By using different cell identifiers at neighboring base stations, hopping can be controlled using a hopping equation based on the cell identifier.<br>
[0007]    As the demand for cell capacity has increased, sectorizaton of cells has grown in importance.   This has complicated the problem of how to implement and control hopping in cells to achieve a desirable result, e.g., control the collisions between cells. With the advent of sectors, there has developed a need to control hopping not only with respect to other cells but with respect to neighboring sectors within a cell. While assigning sectors individual identifiers which can be used as a single control value in controlling hopping sequences as was done previously with cell identifiers, given the relatively large number of sectors in a system, the length of the identifier would need to be larger than in the case of where a cell identifier was previously used, if the same number of cells is to be supported in a system.<br>
[0008]    For a variety of reasons, using large sector identifiers can be undesirable. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, it can be desirable to have separate cell and sector<br>
identifiers with the cell and sector information. This allows for the cell and/or sector information to be transmitted differently and/or at different rates of frequency.<br>
[0009]    In view of the above discussion, it should be appreciated that it would be desirable if method and apparatus could be developed which would allow wireless terminals to control tone hopping based on a combination of a cell identifier and a sector identifier while still achieving both highly predictable and desirable collusion properties with respect to transmissions by adjoining sectors of the same or neighboring base stations.<br>
[0010]    In view of the above discussion, it becomes apparent that there is a need for minimizing the potential for collisions between transmissions that occur in adjacent cells and neighboring cells of a wireless communications system which supports the use of multi-sector cells. It is desirable that the probability that transmissions from any given device in adjacent sectors or neighboring cells will collide repeatedly be minimized to avoid extended periods where communication signals are blocked for any particular device.<br>

SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
[0021]    The present invention is directed to communications methods and apparatus and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for allocating and using tones for communications purposes in a multi-tone multi-sector, multi-cell communications system. The system may be, for example, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) system. The OFDM system may use the same set of tones in each of the sectors or each of the cells of the system simultaneously.<br>
[0022]    In accordance with the present invention, tones are allocated in each of the sectors of a cell of a communications system, e.g., by the base station included in each cell, to. uplink tone hopping sequences according to functions selected to minimize repeated collisions between hopping sequences of adjacent sectors and neighboring base stations. Wireless terminals within each sector of each cell implement the same tone allocation function as the base station in the sector of the cell to determine which tones to use. Both a cell identifier and a sector identifier are used in combination to determine the tone hopping to be performed. Thus, tone hopping is control by two control factors and not simply a cell identifier while achieving desirable collusion properties. In various embodiments, the cell and/or sector identifier to be used at a particular time is determined from broadcast signals received from the cell/sector with which a wireless terminal is trying to communicate. However, the cell/sector information for a give area may be preprogrammed and the hopping techniques of the invention do not require that the celVsector information be received over an airlink although it is desirable in many cases so that wireless terminals do not have to store such information for large geographic areas.<br>
[0023] In various embodiments, tones are allocated for a period of time known as a tone allocation period, also referred to as a dwell. Each tone corresponds to a different frequency.<br>
[0024]    The functions used to allocate tones to uplink tone hopping functions in accordance with the present invention are selected to minimize repeated collisions between uplink tone hopping sequences in a predictable manner even when the tones,<br>
e.g., frequencies, used for transmission in neighboring base stations are misaligned. Such<br>
frequency misalignment may be due to base station clock errors or other frequency discrepancies between base stations.<br>
[0025]     In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, a first base station for a first sector allocates each tone, in a first set of P tones, once during each of a first plurality of P sequential tone allocation periods to a different one of a first<br>
plurality of P tone hopping sequences. The first sector tone hopping sequences are used to determine tone allocation for use in uplink communication from a wireless terminal to the first base station in the first sector. Allocation of tones by the first base station for the first sector is performed according to a first function which allocates each of the P tones used by the first base station to a different one of the first set of P tone hoping sequences during each of the plurality of P sequential tone allocation periods. Allocation of tones according to the first function repeats after P allocation periods.<br>
[0026]    The first base station for a second sector allocates each tone, in the first set of P tones, once during each of a first plurality of P sequential tone allocation periods to a different one of a second plurality of P tone hopping sequences. The second sector tone hopping sequences are used to determine tone allocation for use in uplink communication from a wireless terminal to the first base station in the second sector. Allocation of tones by the first base station for the second sector is performed according to a second function which allocates each of the P tones used by the first base station to a different one of the second sector of P tone hoping sequences during each of the plurality of P sequential tone allocation periods. Allocation of tones according to the second function repeats after P allocation periods.<br>
[0027]     A second base station with a third sector broadcast area that overlaps the broadcast area of the first base station allocates tones for the third sector in a second set of P tones, once during each of the first plurality of P sequential tone allocation periods according to a third function. The third function allocates, during each tone allocation period, each of the P tones in the second set of P tones, to a different one of a third plurality of P tone hopping sequences. The third function is different from said first function and said second function resulting in different tone to tone sequence allocations in the first and second sectors of the first cell and the third sector of the second cell.<br>
[0028]     The difference between the first and second functions may be as simple as the use of a different constant value by the first base station to distinguish between the first and second sectors when implementing the function used to allocate tones to tone<br>
hopping sequences. The constant value used to implement a base station's tone allocation function may be stored in the base station's memory as well as the memory of wireless terminals within the cell which includes the base station.<br>
[0029]    The difference between the first and third functions or second and third functions may be as simple as the use of a different constant value by each of the first and second base stations when implementing the function used to allocate tones to tone hopping sequences. The constant value used to implement a base station's tone allocation function may be stored in the base station's memory as well as the memory of wireless terminals within the cell which includes the base station.<br>
[0030]     The tone allocation function used to assign tones to tone hopping functions in one exemplary embodiment may be expressed as:<br>
fsT ( j, k) = s/ ((1/j) + T*k + k2) which represents a hopping sequence for a logical tone j at a time indicated by k.<br>
where:<br>
s = the cell slope value, and is the same for each of the sectors of the cell; adjacent cells should have different values for the cell slope value.<br>
T = index of the sector. Assume sector type T is in the set {0,1,..., 5), {0,1} or {0,1,2}; adjacent sectors should have different values of T.<br>
fsT = a particular function in a sector with sector index T, of a cell with slope value s.<br>
j = a logical tone and may be referred to as an index of a hopping sequence.<br>
k = a measure of tone allocation period, also referred to as a dwell index; a dwell represents the interval in time that a logical tone j remains on a specific physical tone before hopping to another physical tone.<br>
[0031]    Using the above function with different constant values T in adjacent sectors of a base station, it is possible to limit the number of collisions between hopping sequences of adjacent sectors in a manner that allows the tones of any one hopping sequence in the first set of P hopping sequences used by a first base station in the first sector to collide with any one hopping sequence in a second set of P hopping sequences used by a base station in a second, adjacent, sector at most once during any P sequential tone allocation periods, where P is a constant value indicating the number of tones allocated within a cell using the above function during a single tone allocation period.<br>
[0032]    Using the above function with different constant values s in neighboring base stations, it is possible to limit the number of collisions between hopping sequences of neighboring base stations in a manner that allows the tones of any one hopping sequence in the first set of P hopping sequences used by a first base station to collide with any one hopping sequence in a third set of P hopping sequences used by a neighboring base station at most twice during any P sequential tone allocation periods, where P is a constant value indicating the number of tones allocated within a cell using the above function during a single tone allocation period.<br>
[0033]     When the transmitters of the first and second base stations are synchronized in terms of frequency, the frequencies of the tones in the first and second sets of P tones will be the same. When synchronized, any one hopping sequence in the set of P hopping sequences used by a first base station will collide with any one hopping sequence in a third set of P hopping sequences used by the second base station, e.g., a neighboring base station, at most twice during any P sequential tone allocation periods.<br>
[0034]    The function used to allocate physical tones to a tone hopping sequence may be described as a tone to tone hopping sequence allocation function. The base stations and wireless terminals of a communications system implemented in accordance with the present invention use another function to determine which hopping sequences correspond to an uplink communications channel, and thus which tones correspond to said communications channel, during any given tone allocation period. The function<br>
used to allocate tone hopping sequences to uplink communications channels maybe the same as the function used to allocate tones to tone hopping sequences.<br>
[0035]    Communications channels may be assigned to one or more wireless terminals for use in uplink communication with a base station of the present invention. Accordingly, to maintain synchronization, both the base station and wireless terminals in a cell implement the tone to tone hopping sequence allocation function and the tone hopping sequence to communications channel allocation function for the sector and cell of the present invention. Thus, multiple functions may be used as part of the process of determining the allocation of tones to wireless devices, e.g., mobile nodes and/or base stations.<br>
[0036]     In accordance with the invention, the method, functions, and sequences used for uplink (wireless terminal to base station) tone hopping is different from those for downlink (base station to wireless terminal) tone hopping.<br>
[0037]     In some embodiments of the invention, the uplink tone hopping sequence is truncated before full completion, i.e., allocation of tones according to the first, second or third function repeats over a time interval shorter than P allocation periods, and restarted, thus enabling faster synchronization to wireless terminal which may become active at any random time.<br>
[0038]     In some embodiments the uplink hopping sequence repeat interval is a multiple of the downlink hopping sequence interval, and, the start time of the uplink hopping sequence may be synchronized, i.e., having a fixed timing relationship, with respect to the start time of a downlink hopping sequence. In some embodiments, the uplink hopping sequence may be synchronized with respect to a beacon signal, and there may be multiple uplink hopping sequences between successive beacon signals.<br>
[0039]    In some embodiments, there may be intervals of time between successive uplink hopping sequences, where the hopping is suspended, e.g., intervals of no uplink signaling allocation.<br>
[0040]    The functions of the present invention may be implemented using hardware, software of a combination of hardware and software. Tone allocation charts may be computed once and stored in the base station and/or mobile nodes so that recomputing of the allocation information need not be performed on a continuous basis. In such embodiments, allocation of tones and tone sequences is still performed according to the functions even though the functions are not performed in real time during the allocation process.<br>
[0041]    Numerous additional features, benefits and details of the methods and apparatus of the present invention are described in the detailed description which follows.<br>

Note that neighboring cells 102,104 overlap slightly, as indicated by cell boundary region 168, thereby providing the potential for signal collisions between signals being transmitted by wireless devices in neighboring cells. Each cell 102, 104 of exemplary system 100 includes three sectors. Cells which have not be subdivided into multiple sectors (N=l), cells with two sectors (N=2) and cells with more than 3 sectors (N&gt;3) are also possible in accordance with the invention.

Each sector 110, 112, 114 has two sector boundary regions; each boundary region is shared between two adjacent sectors. Sector boundary regions provide the potential for signal collisions between signals being transmitted by wireless devices in neighboring sectors. Line 116 represents a sector boundary region between sector 1110 and sector 2112; line 118 represents a sector boundary region between sector 2112 and sector 3114; line 120<br>
represents a sector boundary region between sector 3 114 and sector 1110. Similarly, cell M 104 includes a first sector, sector 1 122, a second sector, sector 2 124, and a third sector, sector 3 126. Line 128 represents a sector boundary region between sector 1 122 and sector 2 124; line 130 represents a sector boundary region between sector 2 122 said sector 3 126; line 132 represents a boundary region between sector 3 126 and sector 1 122. Cell 1 102 includes a base station (BS), base station 1 106, and a plurality of end nodes (ENs) in each sector 110,112,114.

Network links 162,164,166 maybe, e.g., fiber optic cables. Each end node, e.g. EN 1 136 may be a wireless terminal including a transmitter as well as a receiver. The wireless terminals, e.g., EN(1) 136 may move through system 100 and may communicate via wireless links with the base station in the cell in which the EN is currently located. The wireless terminals, (WTs), e.g. EN(1) 136, may communicate with peer nodes, e.g., other<br>
WTs in system 100 or outside system 100 via a base station, e.g. BS 106, and/or network node 160. WTs, e.g., EN(1) 136 maybe mobile communications devices such as cell phones, personal data assistants with wireless modems, etc. Each base station performs tone allocation hopping using a different method for the uplink channels, e.g., channels carrying transmissions from the wireless terminals to the base stations, in accordance with the invention, from the method employed for the downlink channels, e.g., channels carrying transmissions from the base stations to the wireless terminals. The wireless<br>
terminals use the uplink tone allocation hopping method of the present invention along with information received from the base station, e.g. channel segment assignments, base station ID, sector ID information, to determine the tones that they can use to transmit data and information at specific allocated times.

Sectorized antenna 205 coupled to transmitter 204 is used for transmitting data and other signals, e.g., control signals, pilot signal, beacon signals, etc. to wireless terminals 300 (see Figure 3) within each sector of the base station's cell.

Downlink tone info 242 may include information including a carrier frequency assigned to the base station 200, the number and frequency of tones in the downlink hopping sequence and cell specific values such as slope.<br>
[0048]    Data 248 may include data that WT 1 300 has received from a peer node, data that WT 1 300 desires to be transmitted to a peer node, and downlink channel quality report feedback information. Terminal ID 250 is a base station 200 assigned ID that identifies WT 1 300. Sector ID includes information identifying the sector in which WT1 300 is operating. Uplink channel information 254 includes information identifying channel segments that have been allocated by scheduler 226 for WT1 300 to use, e.g.,<br>
uplink traffic channel segments for data, dedicated uplink control channels for requests, power control, timing control, etc. Each uplink channel assigned to WT1 300 may include one or more logical tones, each logical tone following an uplink hopping sequence in accordance with the present invention. Downlink channel information 256 includes information identifying channel segments that have been allocated by scheduler 226 to carry data and information to WT1 300, e.g., downlink traffic channel segments for data. Each downlink channel assigned to WT1 300 may include one or more logical tones, each following a downlink hopping sequence. Mode information 258 includes information identifying the state of operation of WT1 300, e.g. sleep, hold, on.<br>
[0049]     Communications routines 222 control the base station 200 to perform various communications operations and implement various communications protocols.<br>
[0050]    Base station control routines 224 are used to control the base station 200 to perform basic base station functional tasks, e.g., signal generation and reception, scheduling, and to implement the steps of the method of the present invention including processing received signals from wireless terminals using the uplink tone hopping sequences of the present invention.<br>
[0051]     Scheduler module 226 allocates downlink and uplink channel segments to WTs 300. In the downlink, each of the sectors of the cell may be synchronized in terms of the downlink hopping sequences for each logical tone, and the power levels applied to corresponding channels segments in adjacent sectors can be controlled. The downlink hopping sequence synchronization, results in the same logic tones in adjacent sectors of the same cell having an identical hopping pattern; therefore, they may collide with each other at every time instance. In the downlink, the scheduler 226 attempts to maintain acceptable Signal-to-Noise Ratio at the wireless terminals 300 by utilizing channel quality report feedback information. The feedback information, maybe, e.g. feedback from a WT 300 reporting on the received pilot signals or beacon signals transmitted by base station 200. This feedback information can provide knowledge of the channel noise curve, including both ambient noise and interference noise, at the WT 300, and thus<br>
provide scheduler 226 with a determination of the levels of downlink base station transmission power required to achieve acceptable SNR at the WT 300. Then, scheduler 226 can match the WT 300 to an appropriate segment with the required base station sector transmission power level. However, in the uplink, a number of different WTs 300 will be transmitting at different power levels, with varying levels of interference. In the uplink, it is harder to categorize and group WTs 300, e.g., mobiles, in terms of boundary/non-boundary criteria. It is impractical for individual WTs 300, with limited power and air link resources, to transmit high power signals such as pilot tones on a coordinated and periodic basis, for measurement purposes. In addition, many downlink channels convey large coding blocks, which may employ effective error detection and correction techniques to handle transmission errors. In comparison, many uplink channels, are dedicated control channels which are small and unsuitable for robust error detection and correction coding methods employed on the downlink. It is undesirable for these small dedicated uplink channels to use up capacity or power for measurement purposes. These small dedicated uplink channels by their size, are vulnerable to errors, especially from strong and persistent interference. Based upon the above discussion, it is evident that the inter-sector and inter-cell interference in the uplink can not be managed by using the downlink methods employed of downlink tone hopping synchronized between sectors, WT SNR determination through quality channel reports, and base station transmission power matching. Therefore, in the uplink, it is desirable to spread the uncontrollable inter-sector and inter-cell interference across all the tones to have diversity gain. The scheduler 226 assigns WTs 300 uplink channel segments in which the logical tones hop between physical tones using uplink hopping sequences, with different sequences generated for adjacent sectors and cells in accordance with the uplink hopping sequence formula of the present invention to randomize interference on the uplink experienced by an individual WT 300.<br>
[0052]     Signaling routines 228 controls the operation of receiver 202 with its decoder 212 and transmitter 204 with its encoder 214. The signaling routines 228 are responsible conn-oiling the generation and detection of transmitted data 236 and control information.

The uplink tone hopping sequences will be different for each sector type in a cell and different for adjacent cells. The WTs 300 transmit signals in accordance with the uplink hopping sequences; the base station 200 uses the same uplink hopping sequences in order to process the received data. Downlink tone allocation hopping routine 232 constructs downlink tone hopping sequences using information including downlink tone information 242, and downlink channel information 256. The downlink data tone hopping sequences are synchronized across the sectors of a cell. Beacon routine 234 controls the transmission of a beacon signal, e.g., a signal of relatively high power signal concentrated on one or a few tones, that may be used for synchronization purposes, e.g., to synchronize an uplink hopping sequence with respect to a super-slot boundary. In some embodiments beacon signals and/or pilot tone signals are used to communicate cell identification information, e.g., a slope value, and/or sector identification information and/or sector type identification information; the beacon and/or pilot signals are generated and transmitted by the base station sector transmitters.<br>
[0053]    Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary wireless terminal (end node) 300 which can be used as any one of the wireless terminals (end nodes), e.g., EN(1) 136, of the system 100 shown in Figure 1. Wireless terminal 300 implements the uplink tone hopping sequences, in accordance with the present invention. The wireless terminal 300 includes a receiver 302 including a decoder 312, a transmitter 304 including an encoder 314, a processor 306, and memory 308 which are coupled together by a bus 310 over which the various elements 302, 304, 306, 308 can interchange data and information.

Base station ID 344 provides a cell slope value and sector ID info 346 provides a sector index type; the cell slope value and sector index type may be used to derive the uplink tone hopping sequences in accordance with the invention. Mode information 348<br>
also included in user info 336 identifies whether the WT 300 is in sleep mode, hold mode, or on mode.<br>
[0057]    Tone hopping signaling information 350 includes uplink tone information 352 and downlink tone information 354.

[0058]    Routines 320 include communications routines 324 and wireless terminal control routines 326. Communications routines 324 control the various communications protocols used by WT 300. Wireless terminal control routines 326 controls basic wireless terminal 300 functionality including the control of the receiver 302 and transmitter 304. Wireless terminal control routines 326 also includes the signaling routines 328 including a downlink tone allocation hopping routine 332 and an uplink tone allocation hopping routine 330. Downlink tone allocation hopping routine 330 uses user data/info 322 including downlink channel information 340, base station ID info 344, e.g., slope, and downlink tone information 354 in order to generate the downlink tone hopping sequences and process received data transmitted from base station 200. Uplink tone allocation hopping routine 330 uses data/information 332 including uplink channel information 338, base station ID information 344, sector ID information 346, and uplink tone information 352 to generate uplink tone hopping sequences in accordance with the present invention. Uplink tone allocation hopping routine 330, when executed by processor 306, is used to determine when and on which tones.the wireless terminal 300 is to transmit one or more signals to the base station 200 with which the wireless terminal<br>
300 is registered. The uplink tone allocation hopping routine 330 uses a hopping function, implemented in accordance with the present invention, along with information received from the base station 200, to determine the tones in which it should transmit.<br>
[0059]    Figure 4 illustrates the OFDM spread spectrum air interface technology of the present invention, implemented for each sector of each of the cells (102,104) of Figure 1. In Figure 4, horizontal axis 451 represents frequency. The total amount of available bandwidth for a particular carrier frequency 453, e.g., for uplink signaling, is divided into a number, P, of equally spaced tones. In some embodiments, there are 113 equally spaced tones. These tones are indexed from 0 to P-l. Exemplary tones: tone 0 455, tone 1 457, tone 2 459 and tone P-l 461 are illustrated in Figure 4. The bandwidth is used simultaneously each of the sectors 110,112,114,122,124,126 comprising the two cells 102,104. In each sector of each cell, the tones, 0 through P-l, are allocated between the wireless terminals 300 in each sector of each cell respectively, for use in transmitting uplink signals. Since the same bandwidth is used in each sector of both the cells 102,104, the signals transmitted by WT 300 on the frequency tones at the same time may interfere with each other, e.g., in the overlapping coverage areas, e.g. sector boundary areas 116,118,120,128,130,132, and cell boundary areas 168.<br>
[0060]    In accordance with the invention, the tones of the OFDM spread spectrum system used by a particular wireless terminal 300 during uplink in a sector of the cell achieve frequency diversity and average interference between adjacent sectors and neighboring cells by hopping over the available frequency bandwidth. The available tones in each sector 110, 112, 114 of cell 102 that are allocated to a wireless terminal 300 change, i.e., hop, according to uplink tone hopping sequences that are unique for each sector type in accordance with the present invention. Moreover, in adjacent cells, e.g. cell 104, the tones allocated to wireless terminals 300 hop according to different uplink tone hopping sequences in accordance with the present invention. This avoids the problem of prolonged periods of interference that might result if devices in neighboring sector and /or cells used identical tone hopping sequences.<br>
[0061]    The uplink tone hopping sequence of the present invention is formulated as:<br>
fsT (j, k) = s/ ((1/j) + T*k + k2) which represents a hopping sequence for a logical tone j at a time indicated by k.<br>
where:<br>
s = the cell slope value, and is the same for each of the sectors of the cell; adjacent cells should have different values for the cell slope value.<br>
T = sector type value. Assume sector type T is in the set {0,1,2}; adjacent sectors should have different values of T. In some embodiments, e.g., with more than 3 sectors per cell, T = mod(sector ID, 3). In some such embodiments, sector ID is an index value of the sector with the value being within the range 0,...,5 and with each, sector of the same cell having a different sector ID value.<br>
fsT = a particular function in a sector with sector type T, of a cell with slope value s.<br>
j = a logical tone and may be referred to as an index of a hopping sequence.<br>
k = a measure of time referred to as a dwell index; a dwell represents the interval in time that a logical tone j remains on a specific physical tone before hopping to another physical tone.<br>
Operations in the right side of the above equation are defined in a modular sense, GF (N), where mod (X/Y, N) = Z, for Y not equal to 0<br>
Z e [0,1,	N-l]<br>
Mod(Y*Z,N) = X<br>
and mod (X/Y, N) is defined equal to 0, for Y=0. Note: GF is an abbreviation for Galois Field.,<br>
[0062]    Examples of the tone allocations of uplink hopping sequences in accordance with the equation of the present invention are provided in matrix 400 of Figure 5. For the examples of Figure 5, let N=5, where N represents the number of tones, andN is the modular operator such that outputs from each modular operation are in the range of [0,1,...N-l]. Consider s - 2, where s = cell slope value. Consider T =1, where T = sector type index. Let F(j,k) be the frequency tone index of the jth hopping sequence<br>
at time k. j = 0, 1	N-1. The periodicity of the hopping sequences is N, Thus k = 0,<br>
1.....N-1.<br>
Matrix 400 of Figure 5 is described below.<br>
First row 402 provides the (j=0) hopping sequence for logical tone 0.<br>
Second row 404 provides the (j=l) hopping sequence for logical tone 1.<br>
Third row 406 provides the (j=2) hopping sequence for logical tone 2.<br>
Fourth row 408 provides the (j=3) hopping sequence for logical tone 3.<br>
Fifth row 410 provides the (j=4) hopping sequence for logical tone 4.<br>
First column 412 provides each of the five hopping sequence values at time k =0.<br>
Second column 414 provides each of the five hopping sequence value at time k =1.<br>
Third column 416 provides each of the five hopping sequence value at time k=2.<br>
Fourth column 418 provides each of the five hopping sequence value at time k=3.<br>
Fifth column 420 provides each of the five hopping sequence value at time k=4.<br>
[0063]    The first row 402 of uplink hopping sequence matrix 400 shall be described in detail for purposes of illustration. Considering the first row 402, logical tone 0 (j=0) occupies physical tone 0 during the first interval of time, k= 0 (column 412). Then logical tone 0 (j=0) hops to physical tone 1, which it occupies for the second interval of time, k = 1 (column 414). Next, logical tone 0 (j=0) hops to physical tone 2, which it occupies for the third interval of time k=2 (column 416). Then, logical tone 0<br>
G=0) hops to physical tone 1, which it occupies for the fourth interval of time k=3 (column 418). Next, logical tone 0 (j=0) hops to physical tone 0, which it occupies for the fifth interval of time k=4 (column 420). The second row 404 through the fifth row 410 may be interpreted in a similar manner to the description provided for first row 402, and thus shall not be described further. An uplink channel may include one or more logical tones, e.g. an exemplary uplink channel may include second row 404 j=l (logical tone 1) and fourth row 408 j= 3 (logical tone 3).<br>
[0064]    In order to demonstrate the computation of the values of the uplink tone hopping matrix of Figure 5, consider the element in the third row 406 (j=2) and the fifth column 420 (k=4). F(2,4) = s/[(l/j) + T*k + k*k] = 2 / [(1/2) + 1*4 + 4*4], where the operations are in modular<br>
GF(N)with N=5<br>
mod ((1/2), 5) = 3 since mod (2*3, 5) = 1,<br>
mod (1*4, 5) = mod (4, 5) = 4,<br>
mod (4*4, 5) = mod (16, 5) =1,<br>
mod (3+4+1, 5) = mod (8, 5) = 3,<br>
F(2,4) = mod (2/3, 5) - mod (2*1/3, 5)<br>
Where mod (1/3, 5) = 2, since mod (3*2, 5) = 1<br>
F(2,4) = mod (2*2, 5) = mod (4, 5) = 4<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the uplink hopping sequences implemented in an<br>
exemplary system defined by equation:	-<br>
fs1(j,k) = £<br>
where operations hi the above equation are in GF(113), and k may be further defined by the equation:<br>
k = (Lmod4)xl5 where:<br>
s = the cell slope value, and is the same for each of the sectors of the cell; adjacent cells should have different values for the cell slope value.<br>
T = sector type the sector. Assume sector type T is in the set {0, 1 ..... 3 } ; adj acent sectors should have different values of T.<br>
fsT = a particular function in a sector with sector index T, of a cell with slope value s.<br>
j = a logical tone and may be referred to as an index of a hopping sequence.<br>
k = the dwell index in 4 superslots: if t is the symbol index inside a superslot, t=9...113.<br>
L = the superslot index relative to the beacon signal of the cell, and L ranges from 0...7.<br>
Superslot = the interval of repetition of a downlink hopping sequence including 1 14 OFDM symbol times, with symbol indexes ranging from 0 ... 1 13.<br>
[(t-9)/7] is a floor function fFL, such that if the input is defined = (t-9)/7, the output of the floor function will be the largest integer smaller than or equal to the input number. For example for t=9... 15, fFL = 0; for t=16... 22, fFL= 1; for 1=23... 29, fFL = 2.<br>
[0065]    In the above embodiment, the number of tones is 113, and the uplink tone hopping sequences repeat every 60 tone allocation periods. The tone hopping sequences would have repeat every 113 tone allocation periods, but are truncated. The length of the tone hopping sequence period is equal to 4 superslots. In each superslot, there are 15 tone allocation periods, and in additional 9 symbol periods in which the tone allocation operation is suspended.<br>
[0066]    The hopping sequences constructed, in accordance with the present invention as described above, have the following properties:<br>
[0067]    In every four super-slots, for any two logical tones, tonejA and tonejs, in sector A and B, respectively, where sectors A and B have different sector type values, their mapped physical tones structured in dwells, overlap:<br>
(1)	at most once if A,B are in the same cell.<br>
(2)	at most twice if A,B are in different cells.<br>
[0068]     Figure 6 illustrates via drawings 500 the timing relationship between superslots, beacon signals, downlink hopping sequences, and uplink hopping sequences for an exemplary embodiment of the invention as described above. Horizontal axis 501 represents the time domain. Two exemplary beacon signals 522, 526 are shown separated by a beacon signal repeat interval of tune 524. Beacon 522 can be considered as part of a first beacon slot while beacon 526 can be considered part of a second beacon slot. The beacon signal repeat interval of time 524 may be subdivided into eight superslots: super-slot with index L=0 502, super-slot with index L=l 504, super-slot with index L=2 506, super-slot with index L-3 508, super-slot with index L=4 510, super-slot<br>
with index L=5 512, super-slot with index L=6 514, super-slot with index L=7 516. Each downlink hopping sequence repeat interval 518 matches one super-slot, while each uplink hopping sequence repeat interval 520 repeats after 4 super-slots. In some embodiments, there is an offset, e.g., a fixed predetennined tuning offset from the base station perspective, between the uplink and downlink timing structure.<br>
[0069]     Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between OFDM symbol times in super-slots and dwell index in an exemplary embodiment of the invention as described above. Drawing 602 corresponds to a first superslot (L=0) 502 of Figure 5 relative to the . beacon slot 524. Row 604 lists the OFDM symbol time index, ranging from 0 ... 113, during each subdivided portion of the super slot 502. The second row 606 lists the calculated value for k, the dwell index in each subdivided portion of the first superslot 502. By comparing rows 604 and 606, it may be observed that the uplink hopping sequence does not apply to the first 9 symbols times (t = 0,..., 8) of the superslot. The<br>
remaining symbol times (t = 9,..., 113) of the superslot are subdivided into dwells, each dwell having a duration of 7 symbol times, and each dwell representing the interval of time that physical tones remain assigned to logical tones before being hopped via the uplink hopping functions. Similarly, drawing 608 corresponds to a fourth superslot (L=3) 508. Row 610 lists the OFDM symbol time index, ranging from 0 ... 113, during each subdivided portion of the super slot 508. The second row 612 lists the calculated value for k, the dwell index in each subdivided portion of the fourth superslot 508.<br>
[0070]    Various embodiments of the invention may use different numbers of tones, different numbers of super-slots between beacon signals, different dwell intervals, different number of symbol transmissions prior to the start of the first dwell in each superslot, and may select a different point to terminate and restart the uplink hopping sequence than those described above, in addition, other embodiments of the invention, may not use a beacon signal, and may rely on other methods for synchronization, e.g. pilot signals, in some embodiments the downlink and uplink hopping sequences shall not be synchronized.<br>
[0071]    The functions of the present invention may be implemented using hardware, software of a combination of hardware and software. Tone allocation charts may be computed once and stored in the base station 200 and/or wireless terminals 300 so that re-computing of the allocation information need not be performed on a continuous basis, hi such embodiments, allocation of tones and tone sequences is still performed according to the functions even though the functions are not performed in real time during the allocation process.<br>
[0072]    Figure 8 is a drawing of an exemplary uplink tone hopping module 800 implemented in accordance with the present invention and using methods of the present invention. A base station is a network access point for a wireless terminal to obtain network connectivity through the air interface. A base station includes one or multiple Base Station Sectors (BSSs). A BSS is a part of a base station. An omni BSS provides service to wireless terminals in the entire cell corresponding to the base station. A<br>
directional BSS may use antennas of a particular direction to communicate with wireless terminals in a subset portion of the cell, e.g., a sector of the cell.<br>
[0073]    Module 800 may be included as part of a base station or wireless terminal and is used to determine the uplink tone hopping pattern that should be used within a sector of a cell corresponding to a BSS. Exemplary uplink tone hopping module 800 includes a pre-hopping index to post-hopping index tone hopping determination module 802, a cell identification mapping module 804, a sector identification mapping module 806, and a time index mapping module 808.<br>
[0074]     A BS may have a BS identifier associated with a BSS_slope_index 812. Different sectors of a cell will, in some embodiments, use the same BSS_slope_index 812. A given BSS in the communications system has a corresponding BSS__slope_index 812, and a BSS_sector ID 814. The cell ID mapping module 804 maps the BSS_slope_index 812 to a BSS_slope value. Multiple BSSs corresponding to the same cell will have the same value for BSS_slope. Adjacent cells will have different values of BSS_slope.<br>
[0075]     The cell ID mapping module 804 performs the conversion from BSS_slope_index 812 to BSS_slope value 816, e.g., via a look up table. In some embodiments, the set of valid BSS_slope_index are integer values within the range of 0:95. In some such embodiments, the set of valid BSS_sIope_index values is the set {0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,' 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73,74, 75, 76,77,78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95} and the respective corresponding set of BSS_slope values is the set of values {7, 8, 6, 36, 35, 105, 39, 74,18, 95,9, 73, 93, 102,11, 34,10,104, 94,103, 106, 5, 40, 91, 77, 46,19, 92, 17, 67, 64, 101, 20, 96,45, 65, 68,63, 78,107, 76,44, 66, 62, 90, 61, 33,48,16, 21,72, 37, 49, 12, 79, 89, 69, 47, 4,22, 38, 97, 50, 51, 108, 60, 100, 41, 23, 32,75, 15, 52, 80, 13, 88, 43, 24, 98, 3, 31,109, 71, 59, 81, 53, 70, 87, 25, .99, 42,110, 82,14,2, 54}.<br>
[0076]    A BSS also has an associated BSS_sector_identifier 814. Each sector of the cell has a different BSS_sector_ID 814. Different BSSs of the same BS may have the same BSS_sector_type 818. However, adjacent BSSs of the same BS, in a preferred embodiment, do not have have the same BSS_sector_type. The sector ID mapping module 806 maps the BSS_sector_ID 814 to a BSS_sector__type value 818. In some embodiments, the BSS_sector_type value = mod (BSS_sector_ID, 3). In some such embodiments, the BSS_sector_ID is an interger value in the range 0..5, while the BSS_sector_type is an integer value in the range 0..2.<br>
[0077]    In some embodiments, for a given BSS in the communications system, the values for BSS_slope 816 and BSS_sector type 818 are fixed and do not vary with time.<br>
[0078]     In some such embodiments, a wireless terminal which desires to use a BSS as its attachment point determines the BSS_slope value and BSS_sector_type value corresponding to the BSS, and then uses these values to control uplink hopping.<br>
[0079]     Time index mapping module 808 includes timing structure information 810. The timing structure information 810 identifies the downlink and uplink liming structure information associated with each BSS, e.g., OFDM symbol timing, and various grouping of OFDM symbols such as half slots, slots, superlots, beacon slots, ultra slots, etc, as well as indexing information associated with the groupings. The time index mapping module 808 receives a current uplink_beacon_superslot_index value 822 and a current uplink_superslot_halfslot index value 824 and determines a time dependent value K 820. In some embodiments, K is the value of the index value of the dwell within a repetitive uplink timing structure for which the uplink tone hopping applies. For example K may be an integer value in the range of 0..59. The current<br>
uplink_beacon_superslot_index value 822 identifies the current superslot index within the current beacon slot within the uplink timing structure corresponding to the BSS. In some embodiments, the value of UL_beacon_superslot_index are integer values ranging from 0..7. The current UL_superslot_halfslot index 824 identifies the current halfslot<br>
within a superslot within the uplink timing structure, In some embodiments, the value of the UL_superslot_halfslot index 824 ranges from 0..14.<br>
[0080]    The pre-hopping index/post-hopping index tone hopping determination module 802 receives control inputs BSS_slope value 816, BSS_sector_type value 818 and K value 820. Determination module 802 also receives fo 826, a pre-hopping tone index, and determines a corresponding post-hopping tone index ft 828. hi some embodiments, a pre-hopping tone index is an integer value in the range 0.. 112 and the post-hopping tone index is an integer value in the range 0..112. Determination module 802 may determine uplink tone hopping for each of the pre-hopping tone index fo values, e.g., 113 values, 0..112, for a given set of inputs 816, 818, 820, determining a corresponding set of post-hopping tone index ft values.<br>
[0081]     Information is communicated on the uplink, e.g., in the form of coded bits being conveyed by values of modulation symbols, e.g., QPSK or QAM modulation symbols. A logical communications channel can include a number of tone-symbols, each tone symbol corresponding to the air link resource of one tone for the duration of one OFDM symbol transmission time interval. A dwell represents an interval of time wherein the tones used for the uplink remain constant. Uplink tone hopping can be employed from one dwell to the next. An uplink timing structure may be represented in terms of logical channels and segments. The tones on the logical channels and segments may be associated with pre-hopping tone index values. The post-hopping tone index values may be the tones actually used for transmission of the modulation symbols following reordering performed in accordance with determination module 802.<br>
[0082]     In some embodiments, the time index mapping module 808 determines K using the equation K=15*mod(UL_beacon_superslot_index, 4) + (UL_superslot_halfslot_index -1), where UL_beacon_superlot_index is an integer value in the range 0..7, and UL_superslot_halfslot_index is an integer value in the range 1..15. In some such embodiments, the pre-hopping index / post-hopping index tone hopping determination module 802 uses the equation f1 = mod (BSS_slope* temp1, 113), where<br>
tempi = imod (tempO, 113), where tempO = imod (f0,113) + BSS_sector_type * K. + K*K, where f0 is an integer value in the range 0..112.<br>
[0083]    The function floor(x) is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to x. For integers x and m, the modulo function mod (x, m) is defined as mod (x, m) = x -m * floor (x / m) where m is referred to as the modulus. For integers x and m, the inverse modulo function imod (x, m) is equal to y, where 1
