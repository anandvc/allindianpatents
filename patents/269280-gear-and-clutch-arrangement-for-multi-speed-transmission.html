				<td>GEAR AND CLUTCH ARRANGEMENT FOR<br>
MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/984,550, filed on November 1, 2007, which is hereby<br>
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
three planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] Automatic power transmissions are currently in widespread use<br>
in passenger vehicles and trucks. As is well known, the automatic transmission<br>
provides a plurality of speed ratios in the forward direction and at least one speed<br>
ratio in the reverse direction. The speed ratios are established through the use<br>
of a plurality of planetary gearsets. The engagement of the gearsets is controlled<br><br>
by a number of fluid-operated torque transmitting mechanisms, for example<br>
clutches and brakes.<br>
[0005] It has become a standard to provide at least four forward speed<br>
ratios in automatic transmissions for use in passenger vehicles. More recently,<br>
automobile manufacturers have increased the forward speed ratios to six and in<br>
some instances seven or eight. This, of course, requires the addition of<br>
planetary gearsets. However, it is desirable to minimize the number of torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms to reduce cost and overall size of the transmission.<br>
[0006] A number of the currently proposed eight speed planetary<br>
transmissions provide three planetary gearsets and six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms. One problem facing transmission designers and manufacturers is<br>
the packaging of the planetary gearsets and the torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
It is preferable to arrange the gearsets and torque-transmitting mechanisms in a<br>
way that minimizes the overall size of the transmission as well as reduces<br>
manufacturing complexity.<br>
[0007] Therefore, there is a need for a new and improved multi-speed<br>
transmission. The arrangement of the gearsets and the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms of the transmission should minimize the size and manufacturing<br>
complexity of the transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] In an aspect of the present invention, a multi-speed<br>
transmission is provided. The transmission has an input member, an output<br><br>
member, a transmission housing, a first, second, and third planetary gear set,<br>
five clutches and one brake.<br>
[0009] The transmission housing has a first wall, a second wall, and a<br>
third wall extending between the first and second walls. The third planetary gear<br>
set is adjacent the first wall. The second planetary gear set is adjacent second<br>
wall. The first planetary gear set is between the second and third planetary gear<br>
sets. Each planetary gear set has a sun gear member, a ring gear member and<br>
a planet carrier member supporting a plurality of planet gears each configured to<br>
intermesh with at least one of the sun gear member and the ring gear member.<br>
[0010] The output member is continuously interconnected with the ring<br>
gear member of the third planetary gear set. The input member is continuously<br>
interconnected with the sun gear member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0011] The sun gear member of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to the transmission housing. The planet carrier member of<br>
the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to the planet carrier<br>
member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0012] The transmission housing has a first area defined radially<br>
inward from an outer periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by<br>
the first wall and the third planetary gear set, a second area defined radially<br>
inward from the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by<br>
the first and third planetary gear sets, a third area defined radially inward from<br>
the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by the first and<br>
second planetary gear sets, a fourth area defined radially inward from the outer<br><br>
periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by the second planetary<br>
gear set and the second wall, and a fifth area defined radially inward from the<br>
third wall and radially outward from the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets<br>
and axially bounded by the first wall and the second wall.<br>
[0013] The first of the five clutches is selectively engageable to<br>
interconnect the input member with the planet carrier member of the first<br>
planetary gear set. The second of the five clutches is selectively engageable to<br>
interconnect the input member with the ring gear member of the second<br>
planetary gear set. The third of the five clutches is selectively engageable to<br>
interconnect the planet carrier member of the first planetary gear set with the sun<br>
gear member of the third planetary gear set. The fourth of the five clutches is<br>
selectively engageable to interconnect the ring gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set with the sun gear member of the third planetary gear set. The fifth of the<br>
five clutches is selectively engageable to interconnect the ring gear member of<br>
the first planetary gear set with the ring gear member of the second planetary<br>
gear set. The brake is selectively engageable to interconnect the planet carrier<br>
member of the third planetary gear set to the transmission housing.<br>
[0014] The first of the five clutches is disposed in the third area. The<br>
second of the five clutches is disposed in at least one of the third and fourth<br>
areas. The third of the five clutches is disposed in the second area. The fourth of<br>
the five clutches is disposed in second area. The fifth of the five clutches is<br>
disposed in at least one of the third, fourth and fifth areas. The brake is disposed<br>
in the first area.<br><br>
[0015] The clutches and the brake are selectively engageable to<br>
establish at least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio<br>
between the input member and the output member.<br>
[0016] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0017] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a cross-section of a transmission<br>
according to the principles of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a multi-speed<br>
transmission is generally indicated by reference number 10. The transmission 10<br>
includes a transmission housing 11, an input shaft or member 12, and an output<br>
shaft or member 14. The input member 12 is preferably connected to an engine<br>
(not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
member 14 is preferably connected with a final drive unit (not shown) or transfer<br><br>
case (not shown). In the example provided, the output member 14 is coaxial with<br>
a longitudinal axis defined by the input member 12. Accordingly, the output<br>
member 14 may exit on an opposite side of the transmission 10 as the input<br>
member 12, thereby providing, for example, a rear wheel drive transmission<br>
configuration.<br>
[0021] The transmission 10 includes a first planetary gear set 16, a<br>
second planetary gear set 18, and a third planetary gear set 20. The planetary<br>
gear sets 16, 18, and 20 are connected between the input member 12 and the<br>
output member 14. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first<br>
planetary gear set 16 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun gear member<br>
22, a ring gear member 24 and a carrier member 28 that rotatably supports a set<br>
of pinion gears 32, 34. Pinion gears 32, 34 are configured to intermesh with<br>
each other, sun gear member 22 and ring gear member 24. Moreover, sun gear<br>
member 22 is fixedly connected to the transmission housing 11 of the<br>
transmission 10 for preventing rotation of sun gear member 22. Ring gear<br>
member 24 is connected for common rotation with a first interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 38 and a second interconnecting shaft or member 39. Carrier member<br>
28 is connected for common rotation with a third interconnecting shaft or member<br>
40 and a fourth interconnecting shaft or member 45.<br>
[0022] The second planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member<br>
42, a ring gear member 44 and a carrier member 46 that rotatably supports a set<br>
of pinion gears 48. Pinion gears 48 are configured to intermesh with both sun<br>
gear member 42 and ring gear member 44. Sun gear member 42 is connected<br><br>
for common rotation with the input member 12 and a fifth interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 43. Carrier member 46 is connected for common rotation with a sixth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 47. Ring gear member 44 is connected for<br>
common rotation with a seventh interconnecting shaft or member 50.<br>
[0023] The third planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 52,<br>
a ring gear member 54 and a carrier member 56 that rotatably supports a set of<br>
pinion gears 58. Pinion gears 58 are configured to intermesh with both sun gear<br>
member 52 and ring gear member 54. Sun gear member 52 is connected for<br>
common rotation with an eighth interconnecting shaft or member 60. Ring gear<br>
member 54 is connected for common rotation with the output member 14.<br>
Carrier member 56 is connected for common rotation with the sixth<br>
interconnecting member 47.<br>
[0024] The transmission 10 includes a variety of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms or devices including a first clutch 70, a second clutch 72, a third<br>
clutch 74, a fourth clutch 76, a fifth clutch 78, and a brake 80. The first clutch 70<br>
is selectively engagable to connect the fifth interconnecting member 43 with the<br>
fourth interconnecting member 45. The second clutch 72 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the fifth interconnecting member 43 with the seventh<br>
interconnecting member 50. The third clutch 74 is selectively engagable to<br>
connect the third interconnecting member 40 with the eighth interconnecting<br>
member 60. The fourth clutch 76 is selectively engagable to connect the second<br>
interconnecting member 39 to the eighth interconnecting member 60. The fifth<br>
clutch 78 is selectively engagable to connect the first interconnecting member 38<br><br>
to the seventh interconnecting member 50. The brake 80 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect carrier member 56 to the transmission housing 11 to<br>
restrict rotation of carrier member 56.<br>
[0025] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input member 12 to the output member 14 in preferably at least eight forward<br>
torque ratios and two reverse torque ratios. Each of the forward torque ratios<br>
and the reverse torque ratios are attained by engagement of one or more of the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 70, second clutch 72, third clutch<br>
74, fourth clutch 76, fifth clutch 78, and brake 80). Those skilled in the art will<br>
readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque<br>
ratio. Thus, eight forward speed ratios may be attained by the transmission 10.<br>
[0026] The transmission housing 11 includes a first end wall 102, a<br>
second end wall 104, and a third wall 106. The third wall 106 interconnects<br>
between the first and second end walls 102 and 104 to provide a space or cavity<br>
108 in which the planetary gear sets 16, 18, and 20 and the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80 are located. Further, the cavity 108 has<br>
a plurality of areas or Zones A, B, C, D, and E in which the plurality of torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80 are specifically positioned, in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0027] As shown in FIG. 1, Zone A is defined by the area or space<br>
bounded: axially on the left by the first end wall 102, on the right by planetary<br>
gear set 20, radially inward by a reference line "L" which is a longitudinal line that<br>
is axially aligned with the input shaft 12, and radially outward by a reference line<br><br>
"M" which is a longitudinal line that extends adjacent an outer diameter or outer<br>
periphery of the planetary gear sets 16, 18, and 20. While reference line "M" is<br>
illustrated as a straight line, it should be appreciated that reference line "M"<br>
follows the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 16, 18, and 20, and<br>
accordingly may be stepped or non-linear depending on the location of the outer<br>
periphery of each of the planetary gear sets 16, 18, and 20. Zone B is defined<br>
by the area bounded: axially on the left by planetary gear set 20, axially on the<br>
right by planetary gear set 16, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially<br>
inward by reference line "L". Zone C is defined by the area bounded: axiaiiy on<br>
the left by planetary gear set 16, axially on the right by planetary gear set 18,<br>
radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L".<br>
Zone D is defined by the area bounded: axially on the left by planetary gear set<br>
18, axially on the right by the second end wall 104, radially outward by reference<br>
line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone E is defined by the area<br>
bounded: axially on the left by the first end wall 102, axially on the right by the<br>
second end wall 104, radially inward by reference line "M" and radially outward<br>
by the third wall 106.<br>
[0028] The torque transmitting mechanisms 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80<br>
are intentionally located within specific Zones in order to provide advantages in<br>
overall transmission size, packaging efficiency, and reduced manufacturing<br>
complexity. In the particular example shown in FIG. 1, the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism 80 is in Zone A, the torque transmitting mechanisms 74 and 76 are in<br>
Zone B, and the torque transmitting mechanisms 70, 72 and 78 are in Zone C.<br><br>
[0029] However, the present invention contemplates other<br>
embodiments where the torque transmitting mechanisms 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and<br>
80 are disposed in the other Zones. The feasible locations of the torque-<br>
transmitting devices 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and 80 relative to the Zones are<br>
illustrated in Chart 1. An "X" in the chart indicates that the present invention<br>
contemplates locating the particular torque transmitting device in the referenced<br>
Zones. An "O" in the chart indicates that the present invention contemplates that<br>
it is not feasible to locate the particular torque transmitting device in the<br>
referenced Zone.<br><br>
[0030] For example, the present invention provides that brake 80 may<br>
be located in Zone A, but may not be located in Zones B, C, D or E. It should be<br>
appreciated that each of the torque transmitting devices 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, and<br>
80 may be located in a permissible Zone, as indicated in Chart 1, independently<br>
of the location of any of the other torque transmitting devices 70, 72, 74, 76, 78,<br>
and 80.<br>
[0031] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br><br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
