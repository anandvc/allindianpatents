BYPASS DEVICE FOR MICROWAVE AMPLIFIER UNIT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bypass device for an amplifier unit for amplifying<br>
communication signals in the frequency range from 500 Mhz (including microwave<br>
frequencies). The bypass device comprises a transmission line bypass segment extending in<br>
parallell to the amplifier. The bypass segment is automatically activated when the amplifier<br>
unit becomes inoperative, e.g. due to failure of some RF component or DC failure, and is<br>
effectively blocked during normal operation of the amplifier unit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART<br>
Amplifier units are being used e.g. directly at the top of an antenna mast or tower in<br>
cellular mobile telephone systems. Such an amplifier unit is a critical component in the<br>
overall system and it is very important that it is operable at all times. Thus, even if the<br>
amplifier unit becomes inoperable for some reason, the signal must be passed on somehow<br>
to the base station located adjacent to the bottom of the antenna mast or tower.<br>
It is previously known to connect a bypass segment in parallell to the amplifier in<br>
combination with switching means whereby the bypass segment is activated in case any of<br>
the amplifier transistors break down or the feeding power to the amplifier is interrupted.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved bypass device,<br>
which is inexpensive and operates properly in the bypass mode at more than one<br>
frequency.<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
The above mentioned object is achieved for a device having the features stated in claim 1.<br>
Thus, the bypass segment of the device according to the invention comprises at least one<br>
section of multiple transmission lines, whereby different operating frequencies may be<br>
chosen.<br>
These and other advantageous features will be apparent from the detailed description<br>
below.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail below with reference to the appended<br>
drawings which illustrate preferred embodiments of the device according to the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a simple circuit including a bypass segment according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically a portion of an amplifier unit with the major components<br>
and transmission lines on a circuit card, and<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically a bypass segment according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The same reference numerals are being used for similar features in the different drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a simple circuit including a bypass segment according to the<br>
invention, The circuitry shown in figure 1 is an arrangement connected to an antenna A.<br>
Typically, the antenna A and the low noise amplifier LNA are mounted at the top of a<br>
mast or a tower included in a cellular mobile telephone system. Normally there is a base<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
3<br>
station adjacent the bottom of the mast or tower, the base station having various equipment<br>
for maintaining and monitoring the operation of the base station.<br>
The low noise amplifier LNA has the task of amplifying received communication signals,<br>
in a predetermined microwave frequency band in a frequency range above 500 MHz,<br>
before these signals become significantly attenuated along a transmission line (not shown)<br>
to a base station located adjacent to the bottom of the antenna mast or tower.<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically a portion of an amplifier unit with the major components<br>
and transmission lines on a circuit card. The amplifier unit 1 is inserted between an input<br>
port 3 and an output port 4, the bypass segment 2 being arranged in parallel to the<br>
amplifier unit 1, likewise between the input and output ports 3,4.<br>
The amplifier unit may e.g. comprise two low noise amplifiers (LNA) 5,6 arranged in<br>
parallel between an input hybrid coupler 7 and an output hybrid coupler 8. An input<br>
hybrid port 7a is connected to the input port 3 via a switching element 9, whereas an<br>
output hybrid port 8d is connected to the output port 4 via a switching element 10. An<br>
isolated port 7c of the input hybrid coupler 7 is connected to ground via a 50 ohm<br>
impedance element 11, and the other output port 8b is likewise connected to ground via a<br>
50 ohm impedance element 12.<br>
So, the two amplifiers 5,6 are single-ended and are coupled between the input and output<br>
ports 3,4 in a fully balanced configuration. In the normal operation of the device, during<br>
which the four switching elements 9,10,16,21 are controlled to a very low impedance<br>
value, the input signal appearing on the input hybrid port 7a is coupled in equal<br>
proportions to the hybrid output ports 7b,7d, whereas the output signals from the<br>
amplifiers 5,6 are coupled from the hybrid ports 8a,Sc to the hybrid output port 8d and<br>
the output port 4 via the switching element 10. Preferably, the hybrid couplers 7 and 8 are<br>
constituted by Lange couplers or modified Lange couplers. However, it is also possible to<br>
use any other 3 dB 90 degrees hybrid coupler.<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
4<br>
Thanks to the balanced configuration of the two low noise amplifiers 5,6, the amplifier<br>
unit 1 is operative in a relative broad frequency band with a substantially constant gain.<br>
According to the present invention, the bypass segment 2 is designed in such a way that it<br>
operates properly in the bypass mode at more than one frequency.<br>
The bypass segment 2 is provided with a first bypass segment section 14 connected<br>
between the input port 3 of the device and a switching element 16, and a second bypass<br>
segment section 19 connected between the output port 4 of the device and a switching<br>
element 21, the impedance of the switching elements 16,21 being automatically and/or<br>
remotely controllable, e.g. by a control circuit (not shown) located in the amplifier/bypass<br>
device or at an associated base station. A third bypass segment section 17 is connected<br>
between the first bypass segment section 14 and the second bypass segment section 19.<br>
A controllable switching element of the type mentioned above may be constituted by a<br>
diode, a bipolar transistor, a field effect transistor or an electromechanical relay. In any<br>
case, the switching elements 16,21 are switched between a very high impedance, such as 5<br>
kohm, and a relatively low impedance, such as 1-10 ohm.<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically a bypass segment according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention. In order for the bypass segment to be able to operate properly in the bypass<br>
mode at more than one frequency, the different bypass segment sections 14,19,17 are<br>
arranged with parallel transmission paths of which only one is in use at a time.<br>
Below, the first bypass segment section 14 will be described. This description also applies<br>
to the second bypass segment section 19 it being of similar type. For the second bypass<br>
segment section 19 reference numerals 41,42,43,44 should be used instead of 31,32,33,34,<br>
reference numeral 21 instead of 16, and "output port 4" instead of "input port 3".<br>
The first bypass segment section 14 comprises in this embodiment four transmission lines<br>
31,32,33,34 arranged at a distance from one another. The first transmission line 31 is<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
j<br>
electrically connected to the input port 3 and the second transmission line 32 is electrically<br>
connected to the switching element 16. The third and fourth transmission lines 33,34 are<br>
arranged between the free ends of the first and second transmission lines 31,32, and where<br>
the third transmission line 33 is electrically shorter in length than the fourth transmission<br>
line 34.<br>
The bypass segment section 14 will have a length being lk of the wavelength possibly<br>
added with a number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..., which length is obtained by<br>
connecting the transmission lines 31,32,33,34 in the bypass segment 14 in different ways<br>
depending on which wavelength the bypass segment 14 is intended for. The wavelength<br>
refers to a frequency within the microwave frequency band being used, e.g. a central<br>
frequency in such a band.<br>
The first transmission line 31 may be connected to the second transmission line 32 in three<br>
different ways:<br>
firstly, a direct 0-Ohm connection between the free end of the first transmission line 31<br>
and the free end of the second transmission line 32 which results in the electrically<br>
shortest bypass segment section 14 (preferably having a length being VA of the 1900MHz-<br>
or UMTS-wavelength possibly added with a number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..);<br>
secondly: a 0-Ohm connection between the free end of the first transmission line 31 and<br>
the first free end of the third transmission line 33, and a 0-Ohm connection between the<br>
free end of the second transmission line 32 and the second free end of the third<br>
transmission line 33 which results in a bypass segment section 14 of medium electrical<br>
length (preferably having a length being VA of the 1800MHz-wavelength possibly added<br>
with a number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..);<br>
thirdly: a 0-Ohm connection between the free end of the first transmission line 31 and the<br>
first free end of the fourth transmission line 34, and a 0-Ohm connection between the free<br>
end of the second transmission line 32 and the second free end of the fourth transmission<br>
line 34 which results in the electrically longest bypass segment section 14 (preferably<br>
having a length being !4 of the 900MHz- or AMPS-wavelength possibly added with a<br>
number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..).<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
6<br>
The third bypass segment section 17 comprises in this embodiment three transmission lines<br>
51,52,53 arranged at a distance from one another, the transmission lines 51,52,53 having<br>
&gt; &gt;z than those in the first and the second bypass segment sections 14,19. The first<br>
transmission line 51 is electrically connected to the switching element 16 and the second<br>
transmission line 52 is electrically connected to the switching element 21. The third<br>
transmission line 53 is arranged between the free ends of the first and second transmission<br>
lines 51,52.<br>
The bypass segment section 17 will also have a length being !4 of the wavelength possibly<br>
added with a number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..., which length is obtained by<br>
connecting the transmission lines 51,52,53 in the bypass segment 17 in different ways<br>
depending on which wavelength the bypass segment is intended for. The wavelength refers<br>
to a frequency within the microwave frequency band being used, e.g. a central frequency<br>
in such a band.<br>
The first transmission line 51 may be connected to the second transmission line 52 in two<br>
different ways:<br>
firstly, a direct 0-Ohm connection between the free end of the first transmission line 51<br>
and the free end of the second transmission line 52 which results in the electrically<br>
shortest bypass segment section 17 (preferably having a length being *4 of the 1800Mhz-,<br>
1900MHz- or UMTS-wavelength possibly added with a number N of half wavelengths,<br>
N=0,l,2,..);<br>
secondly: a 0-Ohm connection between the free end of the first transmission line 51 and<br>
the first free end of the third transmission line 53, and a 0-Ohm connection between the<br>
free end of the second transmission line 52 and the second free end of the third<br>
transmission line 53 which results in the electrically longest bypass segment section 17<br>
(preferably having a length being lA of the 900MHz- or AMPS-wavelength possibly added<br>
with a number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..).<br>
It is also possible to connect the transmission lines in the first bypass segment section 14<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
7<br>
and the second bypass segment section 19 in the same way as has been described for the<br>
third bypass segment section 17. However, this way of connecting the transmission lines<br>
in the first bypass segment section 14 and the second bypass segment section 19 will result<br>
in a decrease in efficiency. This way of connecting the transmission lines is sufficient for<br>
the third bypass segment section as the need for accuracy is not equally important in that<br>
case.<br>
When the switching elements 9,10,16,21 are controlled to a state of very high impedance,<br>
which is the case when the amplifier unit is inoperable for one reason or another (bypass<br>
mode), e.g. due to a failure of a RF component or a failure of the DC current driving the<br>
unit, the bypass segment section 14 will be electrically open ended (its length being !4 of<br>
the wavelength possibly added with a number N of half wavelengths, N=0,l,2,..). The<br>
wavelength refers to a frequency within the microwave frequency band being used, e.g. a<br>
central frequency in such a band.<br>
A communication signal applied to the input port 3 will therefore propagate via the first<br>
bypass segment section 14, via a third, centrally located bypass segment section 17, and<br>
via a second bypass segment section 19. The latter bypass segment section 19 is identical<br>
to the first bypass segment section 14 and the bypass segment section 19 is connected<br>
between the output port 4 of the device and a remotely controllable switching element 21<br>
similar or identical to the element 16. The four switching elements 9,10,16,21 are<br>
controlled in synchronism so as to be either in a high impedance state or in a low<br>
impedance state at the same time.<br>
However, when the amplifier unit 1 operates normally (active mode), the four switching<br>
elements 9,10,16,21 are controlled to a state of relatively low impedance, whereby the<br>
bypass segment is cut off. An input signal on the input port 3 will then propagate through<br>
the amplifiers 5,6 to the output port 4. In the illustrated embodiment, the isolation across<br>
the bypass segment 2 is very high, approximately 55 dB, and there is no risk of feedback.<br>
On the other hand, in the bypass mode the insertion loss in the bypass segment 2 is very<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
8<br>
low, approximately 1 dB.<br>
Furthermore, in active mode, thanks to the low impedance of the associated switching<br>
elements 16 and 21 in the bypass segment, the bypass input impedance in this active mode<br>
is relatively high, whereby the balanced operation of the two low noise amplifiers 5,6 is<br>
maintained. Irrespective of the state of the hybrid couplers 7,8, such a balanced operation<br>
will be retained since the effective input and output loads of the amplifiers 5,6 are<br>
unaffected by the bypass segment. Consequently, the noise factor is very low, and the<br>
input and output reflections are likewise low.<br>
The invention thus relates to a bypass device for a microwave amplifier unit, the<br>
microwave amplifier unit 1 comprising at least one low noise amplifier (LNA) and<br>
amplifying communication signals in at least one microwave frequency band above 500<br>
MHz, the bypass device extending in parallel to said microwave amplifier unit 1, both<br>
extending between an input port 3 and an output port 4, in which amplifier unit 1<br>
switching elements 9,10,16,21 for activating said bypass segment 2 in a bypass mode of<br>
the device in case said amplifier unit 1 becomes inoperable and for effectively blocking the<br>
bypass segment 2 in an active mode of the device are arranged, said bypass segment<br>
comprising a series of bypass segment sections 14,19,17 having at least one junction point<br>
connected to an associated one of said switching elements 16,21, where each of said<br>
bypass segment sections 14:19:17 comprises at least two coupled transmission lines<br>
31,32;31,33,32;31,34,32:51,52;51,53,52:41,42;41,43,42;41,44,42, where the coupled<br>
transmission lines form sets<br>
31,32,51,52,42,41;31,33,32,51,52,42,43,41;31,34,32,51,53,52,42,44,41 of transmission<br>
lines, where only one of the sets is in use at a time, and where each set of coupled<br>
transmission lines optimizes the bypass segment 2 to different operating frequencies,<br>
whereby the bypass segment is able to operate properly in the bypass mode at more than<br>
one frequency.<br>
The device may be modified within the scope defined by the appended claims. For<br>
example, the bypass segment does not have to be arranged on the same circuit board as<br><br>
WO 2007/053077	PCT/SE2006/001221<br>
9<br>
the amplifier stage, but can be mounted on a circuit board of its own, i.e. the bypass<br>
device may be arranged on the same printed circuit board (PCB) as the amplifier unit 1,<br>
or on a printed circuit board (PCB) separate from the printed circuit board (PCB)<br>
comprising the amplifier unit 1.<br><br>

at least one low noise amplifier (LNA) and amplifying communication signals in at least one microwave frequency band above 500<br>
MHz, the bypass device extending in parallel to said microwave amplifier unit (1), both extending between an input port (3) and an<br>
output port (4), in which amplifier unit (1) switching elements (9,10,16,21) for activating said bypass segment (2) in a bypass mode<br>
of the device in case said amplifier unit (1) becomes inoperable and for effectively blocking the bypass segment (2) in an active<br>
mode of the device are arranged, said bypass segment comprising a series of bypass segment sections (14,19,17) having at least<br>
one junction point connected to an associated one of said switching elements (16,21), where each of said bypass segment sections<br>
(14:19:17) comprises at least two coupled transmission lines (31,32;31,33,32;31,34,32;51 ,52;51,53,52;41,42;41,43,42;41,44,42),<br>
where the coupled transmission lines form sets (31,32,51,52,42,41;31,33,32,51,52,42,41;31,34,32,51,53,52,42,44,41) of transmis-<br>
sion lines, where only one of the sets is in use at a time, and where each set of coupled transmission lines optimizes the bypass<br>
segment (2) to different operating frequencies, whereby the bypass segment is able to operate properly in the bypass mode at more<br>
than one frequency.<br></td>
