				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PURIFICATION METHOD OF N-(1(S)-ETHOXYCARBONYL-3-<br>
PHENYLPROPYL)-L-ALANINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a purification<br>
method of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine<br>
represented by the following formula (1).<br><br>
N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine is a<br>
compound of great use as an intermediate for the production<br>
of Pharmaceuticals, particularly an intermediate for the<br>
production of several antihypertensive drugs (angiotension<br>
converting enzyme inhibitors) such as enalapril and<br>
ramipril.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The hithereto-known synthetic method of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine includes:<br>
(a)	the process involving Michael addition reaction of L-<br>
alanine to ethyl β-benzoylacrylate and subsequent catalytic<br>
reduction for transformation of the carbonyl group of the<br>
benzoyl moiety to a methylene group (e.g. JP-A-03-22867)<br>
(b)	the process involving Michael addition reaction of L-<br>
alanine benzyl ester to ethyl β-benzoylacrylate and<br>
subsequent catalytic reduction for concurrent<br>
transformation of the carbonyl group of the benzoyl moiety<br>
to a methylene group and cleavage of the benzyl ester (e.g.<br>
JP-A-58-103364),<br><br>
(c)	the process which comprises reacting (S)-<br>
homophenylalanine ethyl ester with (S)- or (RS)-propionic<br>
acid having a leaving group (halogen atom, sulfonyloxy<br>
group, or the like) in the a-position (e.g. JP-A-63-174956) ,<br>
(d)	the process which comprises reacting (S)-<br>
homophenylalanine ethyl ester with (S)- or (RS)-propionic<br>
acid benzyl ester having a leaving group (halogen atom,<br>
sulfonyloxy group, or the like) in the a-position and then<br>
subjecting the reaction product to catalytic reduction for<br>
cleavage of the benzyl ester (e.g. JP-A-59-181247),<br>
(e)	the process which comprises reacting ethyl (R)- or<br>
(RS)-phenylbutyrate having a leaving group (halogen atom,<br>
sulfonyloxy group, or the like) in the a-position with L-<br>
alanine benzyl or t-butyl ester of and subjecting the<br>
reaction product to catalytic reduction or acid treatment<br>
for cleavage of said benzyl or t-butyl ester (Chem. Pharm.<br>
Bull. 37(2), 280, 1989), and<br>
(f)	the process which comprises subjecting ethyl 2-oxo-4-<br>
phenylbutyrate and L-alanine or L-alanine benzyl ester to<br>
reductive amination (e.g. JP-A-05-201882), etc.<br>
In the above synthetic methods, production of the<br>
objective compound N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-<br>
L-alanine is accompanied by formation or remaining of<br>
various structurally analogous impurities as byproducts or<br>
residual contaminants.<br>
As such impurities, there can be mentioned optical<br>
isomers, namely N-(1(R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-<br>
alanine represented by the following formula (2),<br><br>
N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-D-alanine<br>
represented by the following formula (3),<br><br><br>
and N-(1(R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-D-alanine<br>
represented by the following formula (4);<br><br>
the cyclohexyl derivative, namely N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
cyclohexylpropyl)-L-alanine represented by the following<br>
formula (5);<br><br>
the carboxy derivative, namely N-(1(S)-carboxy-3-<br>
phenylpropyl}-L-alanine represented by the following<br>
formula (6);<br><br>
the ester derivatives, namely N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine ester represented by the following<br>
formula (7),<br><br><br>
in the formula, R represents an alkyl group or an aralkyl<br>
group; and<br>
ethyl phenylbutyrate, etc.<br>
The optical isomers are formed when the optical<br>
purity of the starting material is low, when the<br>
stereoselectivity of the reaction is insufficient, or due<br>
to racemization of the staring material or intermediate<br>
compound. Though it depends on the synthetic method,<br>
generally N-(1(R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine<br>
of the above formula (2) and N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-D-alanine of the above formula (3) are formed<br>
as major byproducts.<br>
The cyclohexyl derivative results from hydrogenation<br>
of the benzene ring in catalytic reduction. The carboxy<br>
derivative results from cleavage of an ester moiety in<br>
hydrolysis or catalytic reduction. The ester derivatives<br>
correspond to the compounds in which the terminal carboxyl<br>
groups of the objective compounds are esterified. The<br>
formation of the derivatives result from remaining of the<br>
starting material owing to incomplete reaction or some side<br>
reaction. Referring to the formula (7), R represents an<br>
alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms (particularly an alkyl<br>
group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms) such as ethyl, t-butyl or the<br>
like group or an aralkyl group of 7 to 10 carbon atoms such<br>
as benzyl or the like group. The ethyl phenylbutyrate<br>
results from reduction of ethyl |3-benzoylacrylate.<br>
Of course, contamination of the product (N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine) with such<br>
structurally analogous impurities should be avoided as far<br><br>
as possible and an effective purification technology is<br>
required for the purpose.<br>
The hitherto-known purification method of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine includes, for<br>
example:<br>
(1)	the method of removing said optical isomers,<br>
particularly the diastereomer (1S/1R ratio = 95/5 — 1S/1R<br>
ratio = 99/1) by crystallization from ethyl acetate. (JP-A-<br>
03-22867)<br>
(2)	the method of removing said carboxy derivative by<br>
crystallization from boiling water (AT402639B), etc.<br>
Regarding the isolation method of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine, for example JP-A-<br>
05-201882 describes a method which comprises crystallizing<br>
an evaporation residue of the extracted organic phase from<br>
chilled ethanol or acetone, but there is no description<br>
referring to the impurity-removing effect.<br>
The present inventors made an investigation and as a<br>
result, they revealed that the above crystallization<br>
methods are not sufficient in impurity-removing effect as<br>
reported in the past (AT402639B, JP-A-09-301938, etc.).<br>
Thus, for example, crystallization from ethyl acetate may<br>
hardly remove said carboxy derivative, and crystallization<br>
from water may hardly remove said cyclohexyl derivative,<br>
ester derivative, and ethyl phenylbutyrate which has low<br>
polarity.<br>
Furthermore, in the conventional purification method,<br>
the low solubility of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine in water or a solvent such as<br>
ethanol makes it difficult to effect crystallization in a<br>
high concentration range, thus having a problem from the<br>
standpoint of productivity on a commercial scale. In<br>
addition, the physical properties (liquid behaviors) of the<br>
resulting crystal slurry and the physical properties<br>
(powder characteristics) of the resulting crystal cannot<br><br>
necessarily be said to be satisfactory, and there found<br>
problems such that the crystals cannot be easily discharged<br>
from the crystallization tank, are not easy to dry and tend<br>
to form cakes in the drying stage, and that because of<br>
small bulk specific gravity, containers of large capacity<br>
are required for packaging.<br>
Thus, the conventional purification methods are not<br>
preferable enough from the standpoint of product purity,<br>
powder characteristics, yield, productivity and the like.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the above state of art, the present<br>
invention has for its object to provide a purification<br>
method of obtaining N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is now described in detail.<br>
In the present invention, for obtaining N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine of high quality,<br>
namely of high purity and having favorable powder<br>
characteristics, from impurity-contaminated N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine, in good yield<br>
with high productivity, the crystallization is carried out<br>
from a mixed solvent of alcohol and water.<br>
The above alcohol is not particularly restricted and<br>
includes, for example, monohydric alcohols of 1 to 12<br>
carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-<br>
propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, 1-<br>
pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol,<br>
isopentyl alcohol, t-pentyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol,<br>
neopentyl alcohol, 1-hexanol, 2-methyl-l-pentanol, 4-<br>
methyl-2-pentanol, 2-ethyl-l-butanol, 1-heptanol, 2-<br>
heptanol, 3-heptanol, 1-octanol, 2-octanol, 2-ethyl-l-<br>
hexanol, 1-nonanol, 3,3,5-trimethyl-l-hexanol, 1-decanol,<br><br>
1-undecanol, 1-dodecanol, allyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol,<br>
cyclohexanol, 1-methylcyclohexanol, 2-methylcyclohexanol,<br>
3-methylcyclohexanol, 4-methylcyclohexanol/ benzyl alcohol<br>
and so on.<br>
Preferred are alcohols of 1 to 8 carbon atoms and<br>
include, for example, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-<br>
propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, 1-<br>
pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol,<br>
isopentyl alcohol, t-pentyl alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol,<br>
neopentyl alcohol, 1-hexanol, 2-methyl-l-pentanol, 4-<br>
methyl-2-pentanol, 2-ethyl-l-butanol, 1-heptanol, 2-<br>
heptanol, 3-heptanol, 1-octanol, 2-octanol, 2-ethyl-l-<br>
hexanol, allyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, 1-<br>
methylcyclohexanol, 2-methylcyclohexanol, 3-<br>
methylcyclohexanol, 4-methylcyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
and so on.<br>
From the standpoint of product quality, yield, and<br>
productivity, a monohydric alcohol of 1 to 6 carbon atoms<br>
is more preferred and there can be mentioned, for example,<br>
methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-<br>
butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-<br>
pentanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol, isopentyl alcohol, t-pentyl<br>
alcohol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, neopentyl alcohol, 1-hexanol,<br>
2-methyl-l-pentanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 2-ethyl-l-butanol,<br>
allyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol, cylohexanol, and so on.<br>
The monohydric alcohol of 1 to 4 carbon atoms is<br>
still more preferred in that it can be appropriately heated<br>
for enhanced solubility, that both removal of the solvent<br>
from wet crystals and recovery of the solvent from the<br>
crystallization filtrate can be easily accomplished, that<br>
it is hardly solidified on cooling to a temperature below<br>
room temperature, that it is easy to work with because of<br>
its low viscosity, and that it is advantageous in terms of<br>
solvent cost and availability. For example, there can be<br>
mentioned methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-<br><br>
butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, allyl alcohol,<br>
propargyl alcohol, and so on.<br>
When any alcohol other than ethanol is used,<br>
depending on conditions, byproducts due to<br>
transesterification of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine, which are hardly removed, tend to<br>
form (e.g. N-(1(S)-methoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-<br>
alanine and N-(1(S)-methoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-<br>
alanine methyl ester). Therefore, it is most preferable to<br>
use ethanol.<br>
When ethanol is used, that ethanol may be denatured<br>
with a denaturing agent. Usable as the denaturing agent<br>
include isopropyl alcohol, methanol, ethyl acetate, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. hexane and<br>
heptane), and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene and<br>
benzene), and so forth. Among these, it is preferable to<br>
use a denaturing agent other than alcohols. More preferred<br>
are aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons, with<br>
toluene being particularly preferred. The level of<br>
addition of the denaturing agent is generally not higher<br>
than 10% relative to the volume of ethanol.<br>
In the present invention, as an auxiliary solvent,<br>
water is used in combination with said alcohol.<br>
Concomitant use of water increases the solubility of N-<br>
(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine to an<br>
appropriate level and leads to improvements not only in<br>
yield and productivity but also in impurity-removing effect,<br>
slurry behavior, and physical properties of crystals<br>
(powder characteristics).<br>
The volume ratio of alcohol to water for<br>
crystallization depends on the kind of alcohol to be used<br>
but it is necessary that the alcohol/water volume ratio is<br>
1 to 20. The upper limit is preferably 18, more preferably<br>
16, still more preferably 14, particularly preferably 10.<br>
From quality points of view, it is more preferably 5, still<br><br>
more preferably 4, particularly preferably 3. The lower<br>
limit is preferably 1.5, more preferably 2, from quality<br>
points of view. The preferable range is 1.5 to 10, more<br>
preferably 2 to 5, still more preferably 2 to 4,<br>
particularly preferably 2 to 3 by which condition the<br>
crystallization can suitably be carried out. It is<br>
preferred that the ratio is selected so as to attain the<br>
yield of not less than about 70%, preferably not less than<br>
80%, more preferably not less than 90%.<br>
In the present invention, the crystallization of N-<br>
(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine is<br>
preferably carried out at pH 3 to 6, more preferably at pH<br>
4 to 5 of the solution composed of the crystals and the<br>
above mixed solvent, from the standpoint of yield and<br>
quality (inclusive of inhibition of formation of byproduct<br>
impurities) . When the pH of the solution is too low or too<br>
high owing to the presence of impurities and so on, the pH<br>
can be adjusted, for example, with an acid, such as<br>
hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or an alkali, e.g. an<br>
alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or lithium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
In the present invention, the crystallization of N-<br>
(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine is<br>
preferably carried out under forced fluidity. From quality<br>
points of view, the fluidity in terms of agitation power<br>
per unit volume is preferably not less than about 0.1 kW/m3,<br>
more preferably not less than about 0.2 kW/m3, still more<br>
preferably not less than about 0.3 kW/m3. The upper limit<br>
is not particularly restricted, but is preferably not<br>
higher than about 20 kW/m3, more preferably not higher than<br>
about 10 kW/m3. The forced fluidity mentioned above is<br>
generally established by rotation of a stirring impeller,<br>
but it is not always necessary to employ the stirring<br>
impeller provided that the above fluidity is obtained. For<br>
example, a system utilizing circulation of the solution can<br><br>
be exploited.<br>
From quality (product purity, powder characteristics)<br>
points of view, the crystallization of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine is preferably<br>
carried out under warming condition and is preferably<br>
carried out at a temperature of not lower than about 20°C,<br>
more preferably not lower than about 30°C. The upper limit<br>
is preferably not higher than about 80°C, more preferably<br>
not higher than about 70°C. The crystallization can<br>
suitably be carried out at about 20° to 80°C.<br>
The crystallization according to the present<br>
invention can be carried out by the routine crystallizing<br>
technique, that is to say at least any one of such<br>
techniques as crystallization by cooling, crystallization<br>
by neutralization, and crystallization by concentration<br>
(inclusive of crystallization by solvent exchange). It is<br>
preferable to use at least one of crystallization by<br>
cooling and crystallization by concentration, and is<br>
particularly preferable to use crystallization by cooling.<br>
To maximize the effect of the invention, it is<br>
preferable that the contamination of various impurities<br>
into crystals of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-<br>
alanine be minimized by controlling the crystallizing speed,<br>
that is to say the crystal output per unit period. The<br>
crystallizing speed is preferably not more than about 50%<br>
of the total crystal output/hour, more preferably not more<br>
than about 25% of the total crystal output/hour. The lower<br>
limit is preferably 1% of the total crystal output/hour,<br>
more preferably 2% of the total crystal output/hour.<br>
In the case of crystallization by cooling, the<br>
cooling speed is preferably not more than about 40°C/hour,<br>
more preferably not more than about 20°C/hour, still more<br>
preferably not more than about 10°C/hour, particularly<br>
preferably not more than 5°C/hour, from quality points of<br>
view. The lower limit is preferably not less than about<br><br>
l°C/hour, more preferably not less than about 2°C/hour. In<br>
this case, since abrupt crystallization with collapse of a<br>
large built-up of supersaturation is undesirable from<br>
quality points of view, it is good practice to add seed<br>
crystals to provide for smooth nucleation where necessary.<br>
The crystal concentration at completion of<br>
crystallization is not particularly restricted and this is<br>
also dependent on the kind of alcohol to be used but the<br>
weight ratio of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-<br>
alanine relative to the volume of the solvent is preferably<br>
about 5 to 40 w/v %, more preferably about 10 to 35 w/v %,<br>
still more preferably 20 to 30 w/v %.<br>
The purification method of the present invention<br>
provides for a high impurity-removing effect and is<br>
particularly effective in removing optical isomers (N-<br>
(1(R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine, N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-D-alanine and N-(1(R)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-D-alanine), cyclohexyl<br>
derivative (N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-cyclohexylpropyl)-L-<br>
alanine), carboxy derivative (N-(1(S)-carboxy-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine) , ester derivative (N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine ester), and ethyl<br>
phenylbutyrate. In particular, it is very effective in<br>
removing the cyclohexyl derivative which is otherwise<br>
extremely difficult to remove. Moreover, the technology is<br>
effective in removing iron and other inorganic contaminants<br>
as well.<br>
To assist in impurity removal, it is effective to<br>
treat the substrate with an adsorbent, preferably with<br>
active charcoal, prior to the crystallization.<br>
The crystals of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine obtainable by the purification<br>
method of the invention can be obtained as wet crystals by<br>
the conventional solid-liquid separation/cake washing<br>
procedure (centrifugation, pressure filtration, suction<br><br>
filtration, etc.) and can also be obtained as dry crystals<br>
by subjecting the wet crystals further to the conventional<br>
drying procedure (e.g. air drying, drying under reduced<br>
pressure, drying in vacuo, etc.) . In conducting the solid-<br>
liquid separation, the yield can be maximized by cooling<br>
the system to a temperature not higher than about 20°C,<br>
preferably 0 to 10°C.<br>
Though not particularly restricted, the purification<br>
method of the invention can suitably be used as an<br>
isolation method or a recrystallization method for<br>
obtaining the crystals of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine synthesized by any known production<br>
method mentioned above, particularly of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine synthesized by the<br>
method involving Michael addition reaction as mentioned<br>
hereinbefore under (a) or (b) in Prior Art.<br>
It is considered that the effect of the present<br>
invention results from the fact that water content inside<br>
the crystals is high when N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine is crystallized from the mixed<br>
solvent of alcohol and water comparing to when crystallized<br>
from alcohol.<br>

benzoylacrylate in 770 ml of ethanol was added a solution<br>
of 6.03 g of L-alanine lithium salt in 426 ml of ethanol<br>
over 30 minutes at room temperature. After completion of<br>
addition, the mixture was stirred for an additional 5<br><br>
minutes, and then 5.29 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
was added, followed by cooling with ice-water. As seed<br>
crystals, 679 mg of N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-oxo-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine was added, and the mixture was<br>
stirred for 4 hours. The crystals separating out were<br>
collected by filtration, washed with ethanol, and dried,<br>
whereby 12.7 g of N-(l-ethoxycarbonyl-3-oxo-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine (1S/1R ratio = 95/5) was obtained.<br>
In 110 ml of 1% (v/v) sulfuric acid-ethanol was<br>
dissolved 2.0 g of thus-obtained N-(l-ethoxycarbonyl-3-oxo-<br>
3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine (1S/1R ratio = 95/5), followed by<br>
addition of 0.5 g of 10% Pd/C, and catalytic reduction was<br>
carried out at room temperature under atmospheric pressure.<br>
After the reaction, the catalyst was removed by suction<br>
filtration, the filtrate was washed with ethanol and the<br>
obtained solution was concentrated.. The concentrate was<br>
neutralized by adding water and sodium hydroxide and the<br>
crystals separating out were collected by filtration,<br>
washed with water, and dried to give 1.5 g of N-(l-<br>

powder characteristics of the above crystals were inferior<br>
comparing to Reference Example 1.<br>
(Reference Example 3)<br>
One-hundred milliliters each of mixed solvents of<br>
ethanol and water in predetermined volume ratios were<br>
respectively adjusted to predetermined temperatures and<br>
each solvent was added until a pure product of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine was no longer<br>
dissolved. After 30 minutes of standing, the supernatant<br>
was taken and the solubility (weight %) was determined<br>
according to the weight after concentration to dryness/the<br>
weight of the solution. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
As shown in the above, when ethanol/water volume<br>
ratio is 1 to 20, the solubility is highly dependent on the<br>
temperature, hence improved yield and productivity<br>
(crystallization concentration) are expected by using the<br>
mixed solvent as the crystallization solvent.<br>

l(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-cyclohexylpropyl-L-alanine content to not more than 0.47%<br>
through a crystallization process.<br><br>
The present invention is to provide a purification<br>
method of obtaining N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-<br>
L-alanine of high quality in good yield with high<br>
productivity, which is accordingly suited for commercial<br>
scale application.<br>
An impurity-contaminated N-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-L-alanine is crystallized from a mixed<br>
solvent of alcohol and water in a volume ratio of<br>
alcohol/water being 1 to 20 to remove a contaminating<br>
impurity into a mother liquor and give crystals of N-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-L-alanine.</td>
