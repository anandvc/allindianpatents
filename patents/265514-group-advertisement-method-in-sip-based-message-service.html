GROUP ADVERTISEMENT METHOD IN SIP BASED<br>
MESSAGE SERVICE<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[1]	This application claims the priority benefits of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/809,845 filed on June 1,2006, Korean Patent Application No. 10-2006-0064641<br>
filed on July 10,2006 in Republic of Korea, Korean Patent Application No.<br>
10-2006-0066573 filed on July 14,2006 in Republic of Korea, and Korean Patent Ap-<br>
plication No. 10-2007-0044692 filed on May 8,2007 in Republic of Korea. The entire<br>
contents of each of these applications are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[2]	The present invention relates to a session based service, and more particularly, a<br>
group advertisement method in a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) based message<br>
service.<br>
[3]	In general, a PT (Push-To) service, which is intended to provide rapid commu-<br>
nications for service providers and mobile communication users, is a communication<br>
service in which one client transmits media data (e.g., talk burst) to one or more other<br>
clients with which a session has been established. A PT service can be a PoC<br>
(Push-to-talk over Cellular) service for transmission of voice (audio), a PTV (Push To<br>
View) service for transmission of pictures (video), or a PTD (Push To Data) service for<br>
transmission of data.<br>
[4]	The PT service allows communication with a single recipient (1-to-l) or between<br>
groups of recipients as in a group chat session (1-to-many), and uses a session<br>
initiation protocol (SIP) to establish a session.<br>
[5]	In the PT service, one PT client can invite clients or groups, to which clients belong,<br>
to a PT session. That is, a particular PT client selects one or more other PT clients to<br>
invite them to the PT session. The session is then established among these PT clients.<br>
Accordingly, media data is communicated between the session-established PT clients.<br>
[6]	The PT service provides "group advertisement". The group advertisement denotes<br>
that one PT group designator designates a particular PT group to inform other PT<br>
clients of the existence of the PT group for use. For instance, a particular PT client may<br>
advertise (inform) about an address of a PT group (e.g., group name) to the members<br>
of the PT group, so that the PT group members can use the PT group address to<br>
communicate with each other.<br>
[7]	The designated PT group can be divided into an unrestricted chat PT group in which<br>
a group advertisement is allowed (accepted) for every PT client, and a restricted chat<br><br>
PT group in which a group advertisement is allowed only for PT group members. The<br>
chat PT groups generally are generally established at a server side, e.g., by an operator<br>
or an administer, so end-users such as customers can simply join such chat groups.<br>
Here, the designator would be the operator or the administrator. Another example of<br>
the designated PT group is a pre-arranged PT group which is generally established by<br>
an individual end-user. For instance, a user of a terminal can create his own PT group<br>
composed of his family and friends as members. Here, the designator is the user who<br>
created such pre-arranged PT group.<br>
[8]	Therefore, generally the PT group designator registers a PT group document for the<br>
corresponding PT group in an XDM (XML Database Management) server. Generally<br>
the PT group document identifies the group name/address and the members belonging<br>
to the group. A controlling PT server performing a control function can process a<br>
group advertisement request of a PT client via a SIP message based on the PT group<br>
document.<br>
[9]	However, the PT group document according to the related art does not specify any<br>
rule or condition regarding the group advertisement, because PT service provides have<br>
not made advertising rules for the group advertisement yet. As a result, in the related<br>
art, every PT user has been unconditionally allowed to perform a group advertisement<br>
with respect to a PT group designated by the PT group designator, which causes<br>
frequent invitations to all the group members due to the over-exposure of group and<br>
group member addresses. Since any appropriate advertising rule has not be provided<br>
for the group advertisement in the related art, the PT group designator can not stably<br>
maintain and operate the PT group designated by itself. As a result, a group ad-<br>
vertisement in the related art is performed many times and unnecessarily, without the<br>
consideration of any relevant factor such as privacy, etc. Also, the related art has a<br>
problem in that information related to the corresponding PT group to which par-<br>
ticipants belong is exposed regardless of their intentions.<br>
[ 10]	Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a group advertisement<br>
method of setting, regulating and applying advertising rules for a group advertisement.<br>
[11]	Another object of the present invention is to provide a technique of registering a PT<br>
group document and a technique of providing a group advertisement based on the PT<br>
group document, and any hardware/software needed to implement such techniques,<br>
which address the limitations and disadvantages associated with the related art.<br>
[ 12]	Another object of the present invention is to provide a group advertisement method<br>
of variously applying subjects or objects of the group advertisement by dynamically<br>
creating a rule set of PT group documents.<br>
[13]	To achieve those object of the present invention, according to an embodiment there is<br>
provide a group advertisement method in a SIP based message service comprising:<br><br>
registering, by a PT group designator, rule information related to a group ad-<br>
vertisement for a PT group in an XDM server; and processing a group advertisement<br>
request of the PT group designator or a PT user by using documents including the rule<br>
information related to the group advertisement registered in the XDM server.<br>
[14]	According to one example of the present invention, the rule information related to the<br>
group advertisement can be defined in the PT group documents according to subjects<br>
or objects of the group advertisement. Preferably, the rule information related to the<br>
group advertisement, which is an element indicating whether the PT group is an un-<br>
restricted chat PT group or a restricted chat PT group, includes a 'chat-group-type'<br>
child element added to a 'list-service' element of the PT group documents.<br>
[15]	According to one example of the present invention, when the PT group is the un-<br>
restricted chat PT group, the PT server allows (accepts) a group advertisement between<br>
certain PT users even if they are not members of the PT group. When the PT group is<br>
the restricted chat PT group or a pre-arranged PT group, the PT server allows the group<br>
advertisement between PT clients according to the rule information related to the group<br>
advertisement designated by the PT group designator.<br>
[16]	According to one example of the present invention, the rule information related to the<br>
group advertisement includes an element indicating a subject of the group ad-<br>
vertisement for the PT group. Preferably, the element regulates whether only the PT<br>
group designator can perform the group advertisement, or every PT group member can<br>
perform the group advertisement, and includes an 'advertise-all' child element added<br>
to the list-service element of the PT group documents.<br>
[17]	According to one example of the present invention, another method for regulating the<br>
subject rule is to set group advertisement conditions within an actions element.<br>
Preferably, when the 'advertise-all' value is false, the PT server allows only the PT<br>
group designator who has created the PT group documents to perform the group ad-<br>
vertisement. When the 'advertise-air value is true, the PT server allows every PT<br>
group member to perform the group advertisement.<br>
[18]	According to one example of the present invention, another method for generating an<br>
element indicating a subject of the group advertisement for the PT group is to include a<br>
'group-advertisement-subjects' (also referred to as 'group-advertisement-sending')<br>
child element in an actions element of the PT group documents. Preferably, when the<br>
'group-advertisement-subjects' value is false, the PT server does not allow other PT<br>
users except for the PT group designator to perform the group advertisement. When the<br>
'group-advertisement-subjects' value is true, the PT server allows any PT user who<br>
requests the group advertisement to perform the group advertisement.<br>
[19]	According to one example of the present invention, the rule information related to the<br>
group advertisement includes an element indicating an object of a group advertisement<br><br>
message for the PT group. Preferably, the element indicates that the group ad-<br>
vertisement message is sent only to PT group members or even to certain PT users, and<br>
is an 'advertise-members' child element added to the 'list-service' element of the PT<br>
group documents. Preferably, when the 'advertise-members' value is false, the PT<br>
server allows the group advertisement message to be delivered only to the PT group<br>
members. When the 'advertise-members' value is true, the PT server allows a PT user,<br>
who wishes to send the group advertisement message, to deliver the group ad-<br>
vertisement message to certain PT users.<br>
[20]	According to one example of the present invention, another method for generating<br>
the element indicating the object of the group advertisement for the PT group is to<br>
include a 'group-advertisement-objects' child element in the actions element of the PT<br>
group documents. Preferably, when the 'group-advertisement-objects' value is false,<br>
the PT server does not allow the group advertisement message to be delivered to the<br>
corresponding users. When the 'group-advertisement-objects' value is true, the PT<br>
server allows the group advertisement message to be delivered to the corresponding PT<br>
users.<br>
[21]	According to one aspect, the present invention provides a method of controlling a PT<br>
(Push-To) group advertisement, comprising: receiving, by a PT server, a request to<br>
send a group advertisement message for a specific PT group from a requesting PT<br>
client; determining, by the PT server, if the specific PT group is a restricted chat group<br>
or a pre-arranged group; determining, by the PT server, if the requesting PT client is<br>
allowed to send a group advertisement based on a PT group document associated with<br>
the specific PT group; and selectively transmitting, by the PT server, the received<br>
group advertisement message to members of the specific PT group based on results of<br>
the determining steps.<br>
[22]	According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method for registering<br>
a PT (Push-To) group document to be used to control a group advertisement,<br>
comprising: receiving, by an XDM server, a PT group document from a designator of a<br>
PT group, wherein the PT group document includes group advertisement rule in-<br>
formation identifying conditions under which a group advertisement to the PT group<br>
can be allowed; performing an authentication of the designator; and storing, by the<br>
XDM server, the received PT group document associated with the PT group if the<br>
designator is authenticated, whereby a PT server uses the group advertisement rule in-<br>
formation in controlling the group advertisement to the PT group.<br>
[23]	According to another aspect, the present invention provides a PT (Push-To) terminal<br>
comprising: a controller to generate a PT (Push-To) group document of a PT group<br>
which is to be used to control a group advertisement to the PT group, and to transmit<br>
the generated PT group document in a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) message to an<br><br>
XDM (XML Database Management) server, wherein the PT group document includes<br>
group advertisement rule information identifying conditions under which the group ad-<br>
vertisement to at least one member of the PT group can be allowed.<br>
[24]	These and other objects of the present application will become more readily apparent<br>
from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that<br>
the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modi-<br>
fications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art from this detailed description.<br>
[25]	The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed de-<br>
scription given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way<br>
of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention and wherein:<br>
[26]	Figure 1 illustrates a method of registering a PT group document in an XDM server<br>
for group advertisement in a SIP-based message service according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention;<br>
[27]	Figure 2 illustrates an example of a PT group document according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention; and<br>
[28]	Figure 3 illustrates a method for processing a group advertisement by a PT server<br>
which performs a controlling PT function using a PT group document registered in an<br>
XDM server, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[29]	Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[30]	A group advertisement method for a SIP based message service in accordance with<br>
embodiments of the present invention may include designating, by a PT group<br>
designator, a particular PT group and registering at least one PT group document for<br>
the designated PT group in an XDM server; and processing a group advertisement<br>
request using the registered PT group document(s) by a PT server which performs a<br>
controlling PT function when a particular PT user (i.e. PT client) requests the group<br>
advertisement.<br>
[31]	In the present invention, a PT client can be a PT terminal such as a mobile phone, a<br>
PDA, a smart phone, a computer notebook, etc. or can be an element in such PT<br>
terminal. A PT terminal is a terminal capable of providing/receiving a PT service such<br>
as a PoC service, a PTV service, a PTD service, etc.<br>
[32]	FIG. 1 illustrates a method of storing and/or updating a PT group document in an<br>
XDM server according to an embodiment of the present invention. Other systems are<br>
possible in which the present method can be implemented.<br>
[33]	As illustrated in Fig. 1, first, in order to store or update at least one PT group<br>
document (e.g., a document 60 in FIG. 2) which describe a PT group, the PT group<br><br>
designator (e.g., a PT client or PT user) 10 sends a HTTP PUT (or HTTP POST)<br>
request to an aggregation proxy 11 using an XCAP protocol (S10) to store or update<br>
the PT group document in an XDM server 12. The HTTP PUT (or HTTP POST)<br>
request is sent to the XDM server 12 via the aggregation proxy 11 (S11). The XDM<br>
server 12 performs an authorization/authentication check required for the PT group<br>
designator 10 (e.g., to verify that the current PT group designator 10 is a valid<br>
designator, etc.) and then sends a response message (e.g., "200 OK") to the PT group<br>
designator 10 through the aggregation proxy 11 (S12 and S13). The response message<br>
acknowledges that the PT group document has been stored or updated in the XDM<br>
server 12. Thus, the designator of a particular PT group can prepare or generate a PT<br>
group document having information concerning the particular PT group, and then store<br>
the PT group document in the XDM server 12.<br>
[34]	A PT group document is generally an XDM document, and an example of the XDM<br>
document stored in the XDM server 12 as shown in FIG. 1 is illustrated in FIG. 2<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[35]	As shown in FIG. 2, an XDM document 60 of the present invention is composed of a<br><list-service> element 50 under which a <list> element 52, a <ruleset> element 54 and<br>
other elements (if desired) are provided. An attribute (content) of the <list-service><br>
element 50 is a group address or other group identification of a PT group to which the<br>
XDM document 60 pertains. In the example of FIG. 2, the group address ' my-<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="274448494142554249444267425f464a574b420944484a">[email&#160;protected]</a>' is provided as an attribute of the <list-service> element 50,<br>
which identifies the PT group. At the <list> element 52, a list of members belonging to<br>
the PT group identified by the group address '<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="45283c262a2b232037202b262005203d24283529206b262a28">[email&#160;protected]</a>' is<br>
provided. For instance, the addresses of the members belonging the PT group are<br>
provided. In the example of FIG. 2, two members 53a and 53b are identified re-<br>
spectively with '"tel=:+l-212-555-1234" and "sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3e565b4c535751505b105c52514d4d51537e5b465f534e525b105d5153">[email&#160;protected]</a>".<br>
[36]	The <ruleset> element 54 is composed of a <conditions> element 56 and a <actions><br>
element 58. The <conditions> element 56 identifies a condition (or an object), and the<br><actions> element 58 identifies an action or function to be performed by the condition<br>
(or object) identified in the <conditions> element 56. According to an embodiment, at<br>
the <conditions> element 56, one or more PT client(s) (or users) are identified, and at<br>
the <actions> element 58, whether or not sending of a group advertisement (e.g., an<br>
advertisement message to advertise a particular PT group address) is allowed by the PT<br>
client(s) identified in the corresponding <conditions> element 56. Here, as a sub<br>
element of the <actions> 58, a <allow-group-advertisement-sending> element 59 is<br>
provided which identifies what the action is. Here the action is sending a group ad-<br>
vertisement message. If the <allow-group-advertisement-sending> element 59 is<br>
"false", then each member identified in the <conditions> element 56 is prevented from<br><br>
sending a group advertisement message. On the other hand, If the 
group-advertisement-sending&gt; element 59 is "true", then each member identified in the<br><conditions> element 56 is allowed to send a group advertisement message to all the<br>
members belonging to the PT group (i.e., the members identified at the <list> element<br>
52. In the example of FIG. 2, since the <allow-group-advertisement-sending> element<br>
59 is 'true', this means each of the members (e.g., "tel=:+l-212-555-1234" and<br>
"sip:<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a1c9c4d3ccc8cecfc48fc3cdced2d2cecce1c4d9c0ccd1cdc48fc2cecc">[email&#160;protected]</a>") identified in the <conditions> element 56 is<br>
allowed to send a group advertisement message to the members 53a and 53b listed in<br>
the <list> element 52, if requested.<br>
[37]	FIG. 3 illustrates a method of selectively processing a group advertisement by a PT<br>
server which performs a controlling PT function using a PT group document registered<br>
in an XDM server, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[38]	As illustrated in FIG. 3, first, a PT client 20 sends a SIP MESSAGE to a SIP/IP core<br>
21 to request a group advertisement (S20). A group advertisement may involve, e.g.,<br>
sending an advertisement message to one or more members of a particular group. A<br>
SIP MESSAGE is a specific message used to transfer Instant Message (IM) according<br>
to known SIP protocols. Here, the SIP MESSAGE includes a PT group address (e.g.,<br>
'<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b5d8ccd6dadbd3d0c7d0dbd6d0f5d0cdd4d8c5d9d09bd6dad8">[email&#160;protected]</a>'). Here, the SIP/DP core 21 routes such SIP messages,<br>
and can correspond to an IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) in 3GPP and to an MMD<br>
(MultiMedia Domain) in 3GPP2.<br>
[39]	The SIP/IP core 21 sends the received SIP MESSAGE to a PT server 22 (S21). The<br>
PT server 22 obtains at least one PT group document associated with the PT group<br>
address (or group identification) specified in the received SIP MESSAGE from the<br>
XDM server 12. As mentioned above, one or more PT group documents regarding a<br>
particular PT group can be registered or stored in the XDM server 12 according to the<br>
method of FIG. 1.<br>
[40]	Once the PT group document is retrieved, the PT server 22 determines whether or<br>
not to allow the requesting PT client 20 to send the group advertisement (e.g., a group<br>
advertisement message) to other PT client(s) based on the retrieved PT group<br>
document. If the XDM server 12 determines that the sending of the group ad-<br>
vertisement is permitted, the PT server 22 sends the group advertisement to appropriate<br>
PT client(s) based on the obtained PT group document (S22). However, if the obtained<br>
PT group document indicates that the requested group advertisement is not allowed,<br>
then the PT server 22 does not allow such group advertisement by the PT client 20 and<br>
may inform mis decision to the PT client 20.<br>
[41]	Step S22 according to an embodiment of the present invention is now described in<br>
more detail referring to FIG. 2. When the PT server 22 receives the SIP MESSAGE<br>
from the PT client 20 (group advertisement requester) through the SIP/IP Core 21 in<br><br>
steps S20 and S21, the PT server 22 obtains a PT group document associated with the<br>
group address (or group identification) specified in the received SIP MESSAGE from<br>
the XDM server 12. As an example only, if the received SIP MESSAGE includes the<br>
group address "<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="82effbe1edece4e7f0e7ece1e7c2e7fae3eff2eee7ace1edef">[email&#160;protected]</a>." then the PT server 22 retrieves the PT<br>
group document 60 from the XDM server 12. Then the PT server 22 checks if the<br>
identified group (e.g., based on the group address) is a restricted chat group or a pre-<br>
arranged group. This determination may be based on PT group information stored<br>
either in the PT server 22 or in the PT group document stored in the XDM server 12.<br>
Here, the group having the group address of "<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="87eafee4e8e9e1e2f5e2e9e4e2c7e2ffe6eaf7ebe2a9e4e8ea">[email&#160;protected]</a>" is<br>
assumed to be a restricted chat PT group or a pre-arranged PT group. The PT server 22<br>
also checks if the requester (PT client 20) is one of the PT client(s) identified at the 
conditions&gt; element 56 of the XDM document 60. If the current requester (PT client<br>
20) is identified at the <conditions> element 56 and the group is determined to be a<br>
restricted chat group or a pre-arranged group, then the PT server 22 determines<br>
whether an action as specified in the <actions> element 58 is to be performed.<br>
[42]	For instance, since the XDM document 60 includes<br>
[43] ...<br>
[44]	<br>
[45]	<allow-group-advertisement-sending>true
[46]	sending&gt;<br>
[47]	</allow-group-advertisement-sending></actions><br>
[48] ...<br>
[49]	and since the requested PT group is considered to be a restricted chat PT group or a<br>
pre-arranged PT group, then the PT server 22 determines that the requester 20 is<br>
allowed to send a group advertisement to the members of the group (value of the<br>
element 59 is 'true'), and sends the group advertisement (e.g., the received SIP<br>
MESSAGE) to the members 53a and 53b of the group as identified under the <list><br>
element 52.<br>
[50]	In the embodiments of the present invention, the names of the elements mentioned<br>
can be changed as desired. For instance, the parameter 
group-advertisement-sending&gt; can also be referred to as a 
vertisement-subjects&gt; or other name.<br>
[51]	After completely sending the group advertisement, the PT server 22 sends a response<br>
(e.g., 202 accepted) to the PT client 20 via the SIP/IP core 21 to inform that the group<br>
advertisement request has been accepted (S23 and S24).<br>
[52]	As such, in the present invention, a PT client/user can pre-set rules about how a<br>
group advertisement for a PT group of the PT client/user should be processed by a PT<br>
client Further, the present invention allows the PT server to control a group ad-<br><br>
vertisement from a PT client to one or more other PT clients based on the group ad-<br>
vertisement rules set forth in the corresponding PT group document stored in an XDM<br>
server. Moreover, by dynamically creating an advertising rule of the PT group<br>
document as illustrated in FIG. 2 according to the type of the PT group and the PT<br>
group members, and if the group advertisement is requested by a particular PT client,<br>
various group advertisement methods can be provided according to the created ad-<br>
vertising rule.<br>
[53]	Hereinafter, five examples of a group advertisement processing method according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
[54]	A first example of the present invention illustrates a group advertisement method<br>
according to the type of the PT group. This method is performed by adding an element,<br>
by which the type of the PT group (e.g., unrestricted chat PT group or restricted chat<br>
PT group or pre-arranged PT group) can be recognized, to the PT group documents).<br>
[55]	For instance, in order to perform this method, the PT group designator 10 adds a 
chat-group-type&gt; child element under the <list-service> element 50 of die PT group<br>
document illustrated in FIG. 2. The <chat-group-type> element can preferably<br>
represent whether the chat PT group is the restricted chat PT group or the unrestricted<br>
chat PT group. Here, "restricted" or "true" can indicate that the PT group is the<br>
restricted chat PT group, while "unrestricted" or "false" can indicate that the PT group<br>
is the unrestricted chat PT group. For example, for the unrestricted chat PT group, the<br><chat-group-type> child element can be represented as follows.<br>
[56] ...<br>
[57]	<list-service uri="sip:myconference@example.com"><br>
[58]	<display-name xml: lang="en-us">Friends</display-name><br>
[59]	<chat-group-type>false</chat-group-type><br>
[60] ...<br>
[61]	In another example, a <group-type> element may be provided under the <list-service></list-service>
&gt; element 50, which indicates the type of the PT group. Other examples are possible.<br>
Therefore, when the above PT group documents) have been registered in the XDM<br>
server 12, in case of the unrestricted chat PT group, the PT server 22, which performs<br>
the group advertisement using the corresponding PT group document(s), may accept<br>
(allow) the group advertisement between certain PT clients (i.e., PT users) even if they<br>
are not the PT group members. Alternatively, in case of the restricted chat PT group or<br>
in case where the corresponding group is a pre-arranged PT group, the PT server 22<br>
may accept (allow) the group advertisement only between PT clients designated by the<br>
PT group designator according to the PT group documents).<br>
[62]	Here, an ID information list of the designated PT clients is predefined in the PT<br>
group documents), as a conditions element, by the PT group designator.<br><br>
[63]	A second example of the present invention is a group advertisement method<br>
according to a subject which requests the group advertisement, wherein the present<br>
invention regulates whether only the PT group designator can perform the group ad-<br>
vertisement or every PT group member can perform the group advertisement.<br>
[64]	For instance, in order to perform this method, the PT group designator 10 adds an 
advertise-all&gt; child element under the <list-service> element of the PT group<br>
document illustrated in FIG. 2. The <advertise-all> element can be set to "false" or<br>
"true". Here, "false" can indicate that only the PT group designator 10 is accepted<br>
(allowed) to perform the group advertisement, while "true" can indicate that every PT<br>
group member identified in the <list> element 52 is accepted to perform the group ad-<br>
vertisement. For example, when every PT group member is accepted to perform the<br>
advertisement, the <all-advertise> child element is represented as follows.<br>
[65] ...<br>
[66]	<list-service uri="sip:myconference@example.com"><br>
[67]	<display-name xml: lang="en-us">Friends</display-name><br>
[68]	<advertise-all>true</advertise-all></list-service></all-advertise><br>
[69] ...<br>
[70]	Therefore, when the above PT group documents have been registered in the XDM<br>
server 12, in case where the <advertise-all> element value is "false", the PT server 22,<br>
which performs the group advertisement using the corresponding PT group documents,<br>
accepts only the PT group designator 10 having composed the PT group documents to<br>
perform the group advertisement, while the PT server 22 accepts every PT group<br>
member to perform the group advertisement in case where the <advertise-all> element<br>
value is "true".<br>
[71]	In a third example of the present invention, a group advertisement method according<br>
to the subject which requests the group advertisement can be variously set. This<br>
method is implemented such that only particular PT users accepted by the PT group<br>
designator 10 can perform the group advertisement.<br>
[72]	For instance, in order to perform the method, the PT group designator 10 adds a 
group-advertisement-subjects&gt; child element under the <actions> element 58 of the PT<br>
group document illustrated in FIG. 2. The <group-advertisement-subjects> element<br>
preferably can represent whether the group advertisement is accepted only for<br>
particular PT group members. Here, "false" as the value of the 
vertisement-subjects&gt; can indicate that PT users represented in the <conditions><br>
element are not accepted/allowed to advertise to the corresponding PT group members.<br>
That is, the PT server restricts the transmission of group advertisement messages by<br>
users (or clients) included in an ED information list of the <conditions> element. On<br>
the other hand, "true" as the value of the <group-advertisement-subjects> can indicate<br><br>
that the PT users represented in the <conditions> element are accepted/allowed to<br>
advertise to the corresponding PT group members. That is, the PT server accepts users<br>
included in the ID list of the <conditions> element to send the group advertisement<br>
messages.<br>
[73]	For example, when the advertisement is accepted/allowed for the particular PT group<br>
members, the <group-advertisement-subjects> child element is represented as follows.<br>
[74] ...<br>
[75]	<cr: actions><br>
[76]	<group-advertisement-subjects>true<group-advertisement-subjects><br>
[77]	Therefore, when the above PT group documents have been registered in the XDM<br>
server 12, in case where the <group-advertisement-subjects> element value is "false",<br>
the PT server 22, which performs the group advertisement using the PT group<br>
documents, does not allow the users included in the ID information list to perform the<br>
group advertisement, while the PT server allows the users included in the ID in-<br>
formation list to perform the group advertisement in case where the 
advertisement-subjects&gt; element value is "true". A fourth example of the present<br>
invention is a group advertisement method according to an object to which a group ad-<br>
vertisement is sent This method is implemented such that the group advertisement<br>
message is sent to only PT group members or even to certain PT users.<br>
[78]	For instance, in this example, the PT group designator 10 adds an 
members&gt; child element under the <list-service> element 50 of the PT group<br>
document illustrated in FIG. 2. The <advertise-members> element can preferably<br>
represent whether an advertisement for particular PT addresses has been accepted/<br>
allowed. Here, "false" as the value of the <advertise-members> element can indicate<br>
that the group advertisement message is allowed to be sent to the PT users represented<br>
in the <conditions> element, while "true" as the value of the <advertise-members><br>
element can indicate that the group advertisement message is allowed to be sent even<br>
to particular PT users. For example, when the group advertisement message is allowed<br>
to be sent only to the PT group members, the <advertise-members> child element is<br>
represented as follows.<br>
[79] ...<br>
[80]	<list-service uri="sip:myconference@example.com"><br>
[81]	<display-name xml: lang="en-us">Friends</display-name><br>
[82]	<advertise-members>false advertise-members &gt;<br>
[83] ...<br>
[84]	Therefore, when the above PT group documents have been registered in the XDM<br>
server 12, in case where the <advertise-members> element value is "false", the PT<br>
server 22, which performs the group advertisement using the corresponding PT group<br><br>
documents, allows the group advertisement message to be sent only to the PT group<br>
members, while the PT server 22 allows a PT user, who desires to send the group ad-<br>
vertisement message, to send the group advertisement message to particular PT users.<br>
[85]	A fifth example of the present invention illustrates a group advertisement method<br>
according to an object to which a group advertisement is sent. This method is im-<br>
plemented such that the group advertisement message is allowed to be sent to PT users<br>
accepted by a PT group designator.<br>
[86]	For instance, in order to perform this method, the PT group designator 10 adds a 
group-advertisement-objects&gt; child element under the <actions> element 58 of the PT<br>
group document illustrated in FIG. 2. As an example, the 
vertisement-objects&gt; element value can be set to "false" or "true". Here, "false" as the<br>
value of the <group-advertisement-objects> element can indicate that the group ad-<br>
vertisement message is restricted to be sent to PT users included in the <conditions><br>
element (i.e., users designated in the <conditions> element 56), while "true" as the<br>
value of the <group-advertisement-objects> element can indicate that me group ad-<br>
vertisement message is allowed to be sent to the PT users included in the <conditions><br>
element. For example, when particular PT group members are accepted/allowed to<br>
receive the group advertisement message, the <group-advertisement-objects> child<br>
element is represented as follows.<br>
[87] ...<br>
[88]	<cr: actions><br>
[89]	<grour-advertisement-objects>true<group-advertisement-objects><br>
[90]	Therefore, when the PT group documents have been registered in the XDM server<br>
12, in case where the <group-advertisement-objects> element value is "false", the PT<br>
server does not allow the group advertisement message to be sent to the corresponding<br>
PT users, while the PT server allows the group advertisement message to be sent to the<br>
corresponding PT users in case where the <group-advertisement-objects> element<br>
value is "true".<br>
[91]	As aforementioned, the present invention allows a PT client/user to dynamically<br>
define an advertising rule in a PT group document to enable a group advertisement<br>
from various subjects to various objects. Also, if necessary, the group advertisement<br>
can be selectively restricted to allow a stable maintenance and operation of a PT group<br>
designated by a PT group designator.<br>
[92]	The present invention has been explained with reference to the embodiments which<br>
are merely exemplary. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modi-<br>
fications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from<br>
the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover<br>
modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of<br><br>
