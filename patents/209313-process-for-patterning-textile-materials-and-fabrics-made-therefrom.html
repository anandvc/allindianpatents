"PROCESS   FOR   PATTERNING  TEXTILE   MATERIALS   AND   FABRICS MADE THEREFROM"<br>
MILLIKEN &amp; COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, of 920 Milliken Road, Spartanburg, SC 29303, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
PROCESS FOR PATTERNING TEXTILE MATERIALS AND FABRICS MADE<br>
THEREFROM<br>
\ 5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to a process for patterning textile materials.  10)   More specifically, the invention relates to a process for producing patterned textile materials using a dye process conventionally used for dyeing solid fabrics, and fabrics made using the process.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
15<br>
Textile manufacturers are continually striving to achieve products having unique and different appearances. While designers can create seemingly infinite quantities of looks for fabrics, the fabric manufacturers must take into account such things as machinery capabilities, costs of raw materials, labor input and processing 20    expenses, performance characteristics required of the fabric, and the like. Thus, the creativity of the designers is often limited by the ability of the manufacturers to efficiently produce the fabrics according to their designs.<br>
One traditional way of achieving patterned fabrics is by forming the fabric from 25)    alternating regions of differently colored, previously dyed yarns. The fabrics made in this manner are called yam-dyed fabrics, and are used in the manufacture of such fabrics as woven striped broadcloth (e.g., of the variety commonly used in men"s dress shirts). While providing a desirable appearance in many respects, there are some disadvantages to yarn-dyed fabrics, the main being that the yarns must be ,30)    dyed in advance to the"colors desired for use in the product. As will be readily<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, this adds significantly to the lead time required to produce the fabric (since colors must be determined and the yarns dyed<br><br><br>
to achieve those colors prior to the fabric formation process) and it can be expensive to produce small lots of particular color combinations.<br>
In addition, the fabric formation equipment (e.g. the loom or knitting machine) 5     must be specifically set up to achieve the particular pattern desired. This can result in significant machine downtime between color and pattern changes. Furthermore, yarn-dyed fabrics have a tendency to shrink differentially due to component yarns having been exposed to different temperatures and conditions during their respective dyeing and processing conditions. As a result, yarn-dyed fabrics often pucker along 10     the regions of transition between one yarn color and another following laundering. In summary, the yarn-dyed products require undesirably long lead times and manufacturing complexity, while achieving products that may have undesirable side-to-side variation.<br>
15	Attempts have been made to achieve patterned fabrics by means other inan<br>
the use of differently colored yarns in the fabric formation process. For example, fabrics are often directly printed with variously colored patterns. In this method, the colors for the desired designs are applied directly to the undyed or previously dyed fabric. The disadvantages of this type of patterning are twofold. First, where colors<br>
20     are being printed over a previously dyed fabric, the color palette is limited based upon the base shade. This is because some colors used in patterning will not be visible or will be changed because of the base shade showing through. An example would be a blue pattern printed on a yellow base shade. After printing, the pattern would likely appear to be green. Furthermore, a yellow pattern printed on the yellow<br>
25     base may not be visible at all. Therefore, with very dark base shades, very few printed dyes would be visible. This limits the designer to using only certain colors with particular base shades or dictates the use of an undyed base fabric in order to use the full color palette.<br>
30	The second disadvantage of this type of patterning is encountered when using<br>
pigments to print over a base shade. It is generally known that the above-described problem of color limitations can be overcome by printing pigments onto the surface<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
of a dyed fabric as is commonly done in plastisol printing. In this way, even white and light colors can be patterned onto very dark backgrounds and the color selection is not limited. However, the resulting pattern has a somewhat stiff and/or rubbery feel and may have a raised appearance as compared to the feel and appearance of 5     the unpatterned area. In many apparel applications, this is not desirable.<br>
Furthermore, with repeated launderings and/or abrasion, the printed pattern may eventually become brittle, crack and peel off.<br>
Another method commonly used is called discharge printing. In discharge 10     printing, the fabric is dyed (typically piece dyed), then printed in a pattern with a paste containing a chemical that reduces the dye, to thereby form white patterns within the dyed background. A colorant may also be added to the discharge paste so that the discharged color is replaced with another color. The discharge chemistry can tend to be harsh and often weakens the portions of the fabric to which it is 15     applied, thereby reducing the overall strength of the fabric. Another disadvantage of this type processing is that only dyes that readily discharge to white when subjected to chemical reducing agents can be selected or there will be residual color left in the patterned area. This type of chemistry adds to the cost and reduces the flexibility of the process.<br>
20<br>
Another method used to produce patterned fabrics is called resist printing. In resist printing, a substance designed to resist dyeing of the fabric is applied to the fabric in a pattern. The fabric is then dyed using a discontinuous dye process.  In prior resist printing processes, the resist agent was typically a water insoluble<br>
25     medium. Examples of patterning processes which use water insoluble media are batik, which uses wax, and tie dyeing, which uses elastic bands or the like to inhibit the dyeing of the fabric in particular regions. As will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the use of these media requires an additional processing operation to remove the dye-inhibiting medium. Where the dye-inhibiting medium is<br>
30     wax, the removal process c#n be difficult and can result in damage to the underlying fabric regions. In tie-dye processes, removal of the bands is likewise labor intensive. Furthermore, processes such as tie-dyeing are limited in the types of design<br><br><br><br>
configurations they can be used to produce, and the wax used in batik does not enable the portions of the fabric where it is applied to be simultaneously dyed a different color from the rest of the fabric.<br>
Another type of resist printing involves the chemical binding of the dye sites of the fibers in particular regions of the fabric. Typically, the resist chemistry will be printed on the fabric in a particular pattern prior to dyeing of the fabric. One example of this method is described in U. S. Patent No. 5,984,977 to Moore et al. which describes the use of a substance designed to chemically block the dye sites of a cellulosic material during a discontinuous dye process. Because the dye sites are bound by the resist chemistry, the fabric will not dye in the regions where the chemistry has been applied. While performing well in many applications, this process is somewhat limited in that the resist chemistry must be selected to chemically block the dye sites of the particular fibers in the fabric, which may present a problem when the fabric to be patterned is made from a blend of fibers. For one, if one fiber in the blend is blocked and the other fiber is not prevented from dyeing, then a total resist of the patterned area cannot be achieved unless the unblocked fiber is left undyed. This results in a heather effect on the base shade of the fabric, thereby limiting design flexibility. In addition, commercially available chemical resist processes are marketed for use in discontinuous dye processes, which have lower production speeds as compared with continuous and semi-continuous processes. Also, such resist chemistries are generally deleterious to fabric strength.<br>
Finally, heat transfer printing is also used to pattern fabrics. This method uses a paper printed with dyes that are subject to sublimation upon heating. The paper is placed in direct contact with the fabric and heat is applied to transfer the dyes from the paper to the fabric by sublimation. Largely used with disperse dyes on polyester, heat transfer printing is normally performed in a dry state, with the heat applied also serving to diffuse the dye into the fiber. This method is primarily limited to disperse dyes that readily sublime. A variation of this method where the heat transfer is done in a wet state allows other dye classes to be used that will readily transfer from the paper to the fabric in the vapor phase. Still, the dye selection is<br><br>
limited and a two-step process of printing the paper and then transferring the dye to the fabric is necessary. Furthermore, resist effects are not made by this process and designs are therefore limited by the base shade of the fabric prior to printing.<br>
5<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The process of the instant invention enables the production of patterned fabrics in an efficient manner, while avoiding extra processing operations required by<br>
10     prior art methods. In addition, the process enables the production of fabrics having the surface appearance of yarn-dyed goods, while avoiding the complexity inherent in yarn-dye manufacturing methods and the fabric strength degradation provided by other dye methods. Furthermore, the process enables the manufacture of patterned fabrics using a continuous or semi-continuous dyeing operation, which achieve<br>
15     greater manufacturing efficiencies than typical discontinuous processes. For<br>
purposes of this application, the term "continuous or semi-continuous dye operation" is intended to mean those dye operations where the fabric generally lingers within the dye bath for a relatively short period of time, generally as a result of the continuous motion of the fabric through the process. For example, continuous and<br>
20     semi-continuous dye operations of the variety contemplated by the invention include thermosol dye processes, pad/steam processes, thermosol/pad/steam processes, pad/high temperature steam operations, jig dye processes, pad batch, and the like. Such processes are typically non-exhaust type processes. In contrast, discontinuous dye processes involve the dyeing of a "batch" of fabric, where the 25     fabric spends an extended uninterrupted period of time in the dye liquor to achieve even dyeing through exhaustion and equilibrium.<br>
The process involves applying to the fabric a chemical substance capable of temporarily mechanically inhibiting the wetting of underlying regions of the fabric, 30     and then continuously or semi-continuously dyeing the fabric. The chemical<br>
substance desirably comprises a print paste. In some embodiments of the invention, the chemical substance may comprise a fluorochemical. In some cases, the<br><br><br><br>
chemical substance may comprise both fluorochemical and a print paste. In any event, the chemical substance is selected so that it mechanically inhibits the wetting of underlying regions of the fabric to which it is applied, while not requiring removal from the fabric by way of a separate removal operation.   To this end, the chemical 5     substance is desirably water soluble so that it is removed, if desired, by the<br>
subsequent chemical and/or mechanical action of the normal dyeing and finishing processes.<br>
The chemical substance can be selected to either totally inhibit wetting of the 10     underlying fabric regions or only partially inhibit the dye uptake such that the<br>
underlying fabric regions dye to a lesser extent than other areas of the fabric where the chemical substance was not provided. In a similar manner, the chemical substance can be selected to correspond with the particular dye process to be utilized so that the chemical substance is removed shortly before the end of the dye 15     process and portions of the fabric underlying the chemical substance are wet to a lesser extent than the base portions of the fabric, thereby having less of an opportunity to bond with the dye molecules in those regions. In this way, the portions of the fabric where the chemical substance was applied are dyed the same color as the uncovered fabric portions but at a lighter shade level. Therefore, a 20     fabric having a pattern formed from varied dye uptake amounts in predetermined regions can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
The chemical substance may also include a dye such that the portions of the fabric on which the chemical substance is printed are dyed a different color than<br>
25     those portions of the fabric dyed by the subsequent continuous dye process. The invention is not limited to the application of a single chemical substance, rather plural different chemical substances could be printed in different patterns within the scope of the invention. For example, a first pattern of a chemical substance which does not include dye could be applied in a first pattern, while a second chemical substance<br>
30     which does include dye could be applied in a second pattern, to thereby produce a three-color patterned fabric. Additionally, a three or more color effect could be<br><br>
achieved using two different chemical substances having different resist characteristics printed in two or more different patterns.<br>
The process of the invention enables the production of fabrics having a 5     unique yarn-dyed appearance without the disadvantages associated with yarn-dyed products. For example, in one aspect of the invention, the pattern printed on the fabric is selected to correspond to the yarns in the fabric construction, to thereby give the appearance of a yarn-dyed fabric. In addition, the patterning capability and pattern clarity of fabrics printed in this manner far exceeds that of yarn-dyed goods, 10     especially where intricate designs are desired. Furthermore, the fabrics retain<br>
substantially all of their initial strength, have good colorfastness, and have superior<br>
aesthetic and functional characteristics.	<br>

25	DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following detailed description of the invention, specific preferred embodiments of the invention are described to enable a full and complete understanding of the invention. It will be recognized that it is not intended to limit the 30     invention to the particular preferred embodiment described, and although specific terms are employed in describing the invention, such terms are used in a descriptive sense for the purpose of illustration and not for the purpose of limitation.<br><br>
WO 0^055785	PCT/US01/i2m-<br>
With reference to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a process for manufacturing patterned fabrics according to the instant invention. As noted, the steps performed in this aspect are printing resist chemistry on the fabric, drying the chemistry 5     (optional), applying the dye, pre-drying the dye (if desired), setting the dye, cooling the fabric (if previously heated), applying chemistry as desired, reacting the chemistry if necessary, washing the fabric to remove excess chemistry, and drying and taking up the fabric. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the specific steps used will vary according to the dye process used, type of fabric 10     being patterned, chemistry used, pattern sought, etc. The steps will be discussed more specifically below.<br>
The fabric to be patterned is obtained. The fabric can be of any variety, including a woven fabric, a knit fabric, nonwoven fabric, or the like. The fabric can 15     be formed of any conventional type of fibers that are capable of being continuously or semi-continuously dyed, including but not limited to synthetic fibers such as polyesters (including, but not limited to polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) and modified versions thereof), polyamides, polypropylene, aramids, polyolefins, regenerated fibers such as polylactide based fibers (PLA) and<br>
20     rayon (e.g. viscose, cuprammonium), natural fibers such as cotton, linen, ramie, hemp, jute, or the like, or combinations thereof. The process of the invention has been found to perform particularly well in the production of 100% polyester, 100% cotton, and polyester/cotton blended fabrics. The fabric will be selected to provide the weight and performance characteristics desired for the end use product.<br>
25<br>
The fabric is desirably in prepared form, meaning that it has been washed to remove oils, impurities and the like which it has picked up during the manufacturing and/or transport processes. Preferably, the fabric is dried as part of the preparation process so that a consistent product is presented for chemical substance application<br>
30     and dyeing.<br><br><br><br>
A chemical substance designed to temporarily inhibit the wetting of the underlying fabric areas is then applied to the fabric in a desired pattern. The chemical substance is desirably applied to the fabric by a printing process. For example, the printing process can be roller bed printing, rotary screen printing, 5     flexographic printing, gravure roll application, multiple nozzle injection patterning (such as that described in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,923,743), or the like. However, other application methods are contemplated within the scope of the invention including, but not limited to flick brush, ultrasonic spray, foam application.print head pattern methods, and the like. The chemical substance can be<br>
10     applied in any desired pattern. Alternatively, the application "pattern" can be that of randomized spots or the like (e.g. such as those achieved with a flick brush.) As will be readily appreciated, the regions where the chemistry is applied will determine the pattern of undyed or differentially dyed areas on the finished fabric, and the variety of application patterns is essentially limitless. As a result, the process can be used to<br>
15     achieve a limitless variety of fabric appearances.<br>
The chemical substance is designed to physically inhibit the wetting of underlying regions of the fabric for a period of time. In one aspect of the invention, the chemical substance is designed to prevent wetting of the underlying regions of<br>
20     the fabric for a period of time greater than the fabric is in contact with the aqueous dye liquor. In another aspect of the invention, the chemical substance can be selected to prevent saturation of the underlying regions while allowing some wetting, either by virtue of the length of time it inhibits wetting or the degree it inhibits wetting. The fabric may retain the property of being inhibited from wetting after processing<br>
25     since the downstream processing does not require the removal of the chemistry. (In contrast, prior means of mechanically inhibiting the wetting of fabric areas such as wax require a separate processing step to remove the substance, since the fabric would not have the aesthetic and performance characteristics sufficient to render it useful until such time as that substance was removed.) To this end, the chemical<br>
30     substance is desirably water soluble.<br><br>
Stated differently, the chemical substance is selected to inhibit wetting of the underlying portions of the fabric, and preferably to totally inhibit wetting. Where the chemical substance is designed to partially inhibit wetting of the fabric, it can be selected to allow underlying portions of the fabric to wet at a significantly slower rate 5     than the untreated regions, or it can be selected to inhibit wetting for a period of time somewhat shorter than the length of the dye process. In this way, portions of the fabric on which the chemical substance has been printed will be exposed to a lesser amount of the dye and/or exposed for a lesser length of time than the untreated fabric regions. As a result, the portions of the fabric that were treated with the 10     chemical substance will be dyed the same basic color (hue) as the surrounding<br>
fabric regions, but with a depth of shade ranging from slightly lighter to much lighter than the untreated regions.<br>
The chemical substance preferably includes a print paste comprising a 15     thickening agent and water. In some forms of the invention, the chemical substance includes a fluorochemical. In some forms of the invention, the chemical substance includes both a print paste and a fluorochemical. In any event, the chemical substance is selected so that it inhibits the wetting of underlying regions of the fabric to which it is applied, while not requiring removal from the fabric by way of a 20     separate removal operation, as will be discussed further herein.<br>
Examples of chemical substances that have been found to perform well in the instant invention are alginate-based print pastes, xanthan-based print pastes, synthetic-thickener-based print pastes, a wide variety of fluorochemicals, and<br>
25  combinations thereof. The viscosity and rheology of the chemical substance will be selected to optimize wetting inhibition and to achieve the intended design appearance in the finished fabric. As will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the precise chemical substance formulation used will be selected to accommodate the application method used, screen or mesh size, add-on desired,<br>
30     etc. Such parameters are all contemplated within the scope of the invention, with the precise formulations used for each fabric being readily discernable without undue experimentation. It has been found that in a rotary screen print process (such as<br><br><br>
that used herein in the examples), a chemical substance viscosity of about 8 poise to about 70 poise, and preferably about 10 poise to about 40 poise (depending on the thickening agent used) performs well. The chemical substance will be applied at a pressure designed to achieve even printing with adequate penetration for the specific 5     chemical substance and substrate used. For example, pressure ranges of about 3 psi to about 10 psi have been found to perform well for the chemical substances described above. In addition, the pressure at which the chemical substance is applied will be selected to optimize penetration of the substance into the particular fabric to the extent necessary to achieve the desired design and to achieve evenly 10     printed goods. Likewise, the rheology of the chemical substance desirably provides good flow and quick stop characteristics.<br>
In some forms of the invention, the chemical substance will also include a dye. In this way, the portions of the fabric on which the chemical substance is<br>
15     applied will be printed a first color, while surrounding regions of the base fabric not having the chemical substance thereon will be dyed a different color during the dye process. As will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the chemical substances may be applied more than once using different patterns and different chemical substances. Therefore, the process can be used to form an<br>
20     essentially infinite number of fabric patterns and appearances. For example, the chemical substance can be applied to the fabric such that it mimics the pattern of yarns in a fabric construction, such as through a pattern of stripes printed in the direction of warp or filling yarns on a woven fabric to simulate a yarn-dyed striped fabric. Furthermore, the chemical substance may include other types of chemicals<br>
25     such as optical brighteners, different dye classes, copolymers, any type of chemistry that provides an additional benefit without interfering with the properties necessary for this invention to operate, and the like.<br>
In most instances, it will be desirable to dry the chemistry prior to the 30     subsequent dyeing step. This can be done by way of any method conventionally used to dry fabrics, such as by passing the fabric through an oven. This helps secure the chemical substance to the underlying fabric portions. The temperature<br><br><br>
and method used will be selected to optimize performance of the chemical substance and substrate used.<br>
The fabric is then dyed in a conventional continuous or semi-continuous 5     manner such as by a thermosol dye process. However, other types of dye<br>
operations such as pad/steam processes, thermosol/pad/steam processes, cold pad batch, jig dye processes, and the like can also be used within the scope of the instant invention with varying effects. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the dyeing process used will be selected depending on the type of fabric 10     being processed as well as the type of dye to be used. Similarly, the type and<br>
amount of chemical substance used will be selected to optimize the appearance of the dyed fabric. In other words, the type of dye process and chemical substance will be coordinated so that the mechanical inhibition of wetting provided by the chemical substance survives the specific dye process used to the extent necessary to achieve 15     the desired patterned effect from dyeing. Similarly, the dye method utilized will be selected to achieve the desired results for the particular fabric being produced. For example, in many cases it will be desirable to utilize high efficiency continuous and semi-continuous dye processes; in such cases the yarns forming the fabric will often be ring dyed. 20<br>
When a thermosol/pad-steam process is used, the process generally goes as follows: The fabric having the chemical substance applied to it is routed through the dye pad, where the fabric is saturated with dye, with the exception of those regions where the chemical substance prevents the fabric from fully wetting. The fabric is 25     desirably pre-dried, and then heated to a temperature sufficient to sublime the<br>
dyestuff into the substrate such that the dyes sublime and penetrate into the fibers. The fabric is then desirably steamed, scoured and washed in a conventional manner to remove any excess chemistry and dye that may remain. The fabric is cooled, and any finish chemistries that are desired can be applied. For example, chemistries 30     designed to promote soil release and wicking, or reduce static and/or pilling, etc. can be provided according to the needs of the fabric. In addition, any desired face<br><br><br><br>
finishing operations can also be performed as needed. dried and packaged for distribution.<br>
The fabric is then desirably<br>
The dye utilized can also be selected to achieve the type of appearance 5     desired. For example, where the textile fabric is a polyester/cotton blended fabric and it is desired to have a solid-colored base fabric, a combination of disperse and vat dyes may be utilized to achieve dyeing of both the polyester and cotton constituents. In this instance, a thermosol/pad/steam process could be utilized with the additional steps of steaming, scouring and washing added to the process<br>
10     described above after the thermosol oven. Alternatively, the dye bath may include dyes that are designed to dye only one of the fiber constituents, so as to achieve a heather type appearance of the base fabric. For example, a polyester/cotton blended fabric could be exposed to disperse dyes only, which will dye the polyester component while leaving the cotton component substantially undyed, to thereby<br>
15     achieve a unique appearance of the base fabric.<br>
As noted above, the chemical substance is selected to at least temporarily inhibit wetting of portions of the fabric, so that a pattern can be produced on the fabric during a continuous or semi-continuous dye process. The nature of the<br>
20     chemical substance results in it not requiring a subsequent removal process.  In other words, the action of the dye process, drying, finishing and/or scouring operations serve to remove any of the chemistry that would interfere with the end performance of the fabric. For example, where the chemical substance includes or consists essentially of a print paste, the subsequent processing steps generally<br>
25     serve to remove the print paste from the fabric. By the same token, where the chemical substance comprises or consists essentially of a fluorocarbon, it may be desirable for some of the fluorocarbon chemistry to remain on the fabric in order that long term water repellency in the printed areas is achieved. In any event, the chemical substance and dye process used can be coordinated so that the amount of<br>
30     the chemical substance that remains on the fabric following processing is controlled at desired levels.<br><br>
As illustrated by a comparison of the yarn-dyed fabric in Fig. 2 and the fabric of the invention illustrated in Fig. 3, the fabrics produced according to the process of the invention have superior appearance, in many cases closely approximating the appearance of yarn-dyed fabrics, while avoiding the problems with that production 5     process. For example, the differential shrinkage problems commonly associated with yarn-dyed fabrics can be avoided because the base fabric can be produced in a uniform construction if so desired. The fabrics of the invention also have good performance characteristics such as good uniform physical strength, appearance, colorfastness, washfastness, design durability, and a consistent feel or hand across 10      patterned and unpatterned areas.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
15	Three samples of commercially-available yarn-dyed shirting fabrics were<br>
obtained and are described below as Samples A, B and C.<br>
Sample A was a bright blue and dark grey striped conventional poplin fabric having a weight of 4.3 oz/sq yd. The finished construction had 102 ends per inch 20     and 57 picks per inch. Both warp and filling yarns consisted of a 65% polyester and 35% cotton blend.   It is believed by the inventors that the fabric had been treated with conventional soil release and permanent press chemistries, and lightly sanded.<br>
Sample B was a conventional poplin fabric having small blue stripes on a 25     white background. The fabric had a weight of 4.3 oz/ sq yd and a finished<br>
construction having 77 ends per inch and 59 picks per inch.   Both warp and filling yarns consisted of a 65% polyester and 35% cotton blend.   It is believed by the inventors that the fabric had been treated with conventional soil release and permanent press chemistries, and lightly sanded. 30<br>
Sample C was a conventional poplin fabric having multi-colored stripes. The fabric had a weight of 4.3 oz/ sq yd and a finished construction of 104 ends per inch<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and 60 picks per inch. Both warp and filling yarns consisted of a 65% polyester and 35% cotton blend. It is believed by the inventors that the fabric had been treated with conventional soil release and permanent press chemistries, and lightly sanded.<br>

TEST METHODS:<br>
20	For purposes of these tests, the term "industrial washes" is intended to<br>
describe the wash process described below.<br>
Industrial Wash Test: PROCEDURE: 25<br>
1.       Weigh samples to make a 15 ±1) pound load.<br>
Note: Use 100% cotton white dummies if necessary to achieve the proper<br>
load weight.<br>
30     2.        Industrial Laundry Process Specifications (Milnor Washer):<br><br><br><br>
Start the cycle with the signal switch in the down position.<br>
W/L refers to water level. LOW = 12 gallons and HIGH = 24 gallons.<br>
Take 4 (+.25) pounds out of the 15 (±1) pound load and place in the Sears Kenmore Home Dryer. (Insure all of the samples are placed in the dryer, if you have more than 4.25 pounds of samples, split them into two loads with an even number of samples in each. The balance of each load should be made up of dummy fabric.)<br>
Set the dryer on the Cotton Sturdy setting for 30 minutes. Insure the samples are completely dry prior to removing them from the dryer.<br>
Repeat the above wash and dry steps for the specified number of cycles.<br>
Orthosil = Orthobrite<br><br><br><br>
Tensile Strength: The tensile strength of each of the fabric samples was tested in each of the warp and fill directions according to ASTM D-5034-95. A number of the samples were also tested after 10, 25, 50 and 100 Industrial Washes.<br>
5	Tear Strength: The tear strength of each of the fabric samples was tested in<br>
each of the warp and fill directions using an Elmendorf Tear Test according to ASTM D1424-96. A number of the samples were also tested after 10, 25, 50 and 100 industrial washes.<br>
10	Seam Slippage: Seam slippage was tested in both the warp and fill directions<br>
according to the ASTM D-434-42 Test Method.<br>
Flex: Fabric flexion was tested in both the warp and fill directions according to ASTM D3885-99. 15<br>
Appearance: Fabrics were washed according to the above-described wash methods, and rated according to AATCC Test Method 124-1992.<br>
Pilling: Fabric pilling was tested according to ASTM D-3512-99A. For the 20     yarn dyed products, it was tested as received and after 10, 25 and 50 industrial washes. For the fabrics of the invention, pilling was tested as received.<br>
Color Data: Raw color data was measured using a 10 degree spherical spectrophotometer, with a D65, specular excluded light source with a UV filter set at 25     0%. The untreated regions were as the standard and the treated regions were read as the sample. The DE, DL, Da and Db were calculated using the following formulae:<br><br>
30<br><br>
DL = L1 - L2, withL1 being the untreated and L2 being the treated. Da = A1 A2, with A1 being the untreated and A2 being the treated.<br><br><br><br>
Db = B1 B2, with B-1being the untreated and B2 being the treated.<br><br><br><br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
% Strength = area under reflectance curve of treated area area under reflectance curve of untreated area<br>
DE is indicative of the overall color difference between the two areas, while DL is indicative of the difference in depth of shade. For example, a DL of zero would indicate there was no difference in the depth of shade between the two areas. Da is indicative of the difference in red/green hues, while Db is indicative of differences in yellow/blue hues.   The Strength rating illustrates the % difference in the color for the two regions. For those samples where the resist chemistry did not include a dye, a low strength number would illustrate a high amount of resist.<br>
The results of each of the tests are recorded below in Tables A and B.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

As noted from the examples, both the synthetic and the alginate print pastes enabled the production of patterned fabrics using a continuous dye process. However, the alginate was found to perform better than the particular synthetic print paste used based upon the specific conditions (viscosity, pressure, screen mesh, etc) used. However, it was found that each of the pastes tested provided good patterning while minimizing the strength loss of the fabric. It is noted that varying<br><br><br>
degrees of resistance of dyeing can be achieved using the process of the invention, through the selection of the type of resist chemistry, application method, substrate, and dyes used, and the like. Patterns using high to substantially complete resistance as well as those having lower levels of resistance (to achieve only subtle 5     color variations) are all contemplated within the scope of the invention.<br>
The fabrics produced according to the invention can be used in any end use where patterned textiles would have utility, including but not limited to apparel, home furnishings, napery, industrial products, or the like. As evidenced by the durability of 10     the products following industrial launderings, the fabrics will have particular utility in the manufacture of garments used in the rental laundry markets.<br>
