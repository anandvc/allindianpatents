				<td>Desert cooler is useful in ensuring continued and effective cooling by maintaining the cooling pad and the recirculating cooling water permanently clean. Desert cooler,is provided with a moving cooling pad (3) which continuously keeps in motion and dipping in cooling water in the basin (7) to shed off the accumulated mud/ dust particles and this mud is periodically drained off through the perforated bush (9) at the bottom opening (11), facilitated by a moving belt (8) having an opening (10). Thus both the cooling pad (3) and the cooling recirculating water in the water basin (7) are always clean so as to ensure efficient cooling.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to Desert Cooler for cooling of rooms and other spaces. Known art<br>
Desert coolers of the prior known art have typical machines where a fan sucks air through wet cooling pads filters, resulting in evaporative cooling and throws the cooled air into rooms. Pads and filters are made and kept wet with the use of a water pump which keeps water recirculating, pumping it up from the bottom tank to the cooling pads/filters.<br>
Disadvantages of the known art.<br>
This prior known art has several disadvantages, namely:<br>
a.	choking of pads/filters due to dust pollution corning from ambient air and the foulants which<br>
grow in stagnant stored water, making the evaporative cooling less effective.<br>
b.	accumulation of foulants in the recirculating water which leads to foul  smell as well as<br>
inefficient evaporation due to lowered purity level of water and<br>
c.	frequent breakdown of water circulating pump because of the hostile conditions in which it<br>
operates i.e. high moisture and frequent splashes of water.<br>
Objects of this invention<br>
It is the object of this invention to devise a desert cooler for obviating the aforesaid prior art defects and to cause cooling in an effective and trouble free manner.<br>
It is also the object of this invention to have the desert cooler which is simple in design, easy for operation and maintenance and therefore less expensive.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a moving belt like round cooling pad. mounted on a belt made of self-lubricating material (plastic) and its round movement is provided bv a motor. The movement of the cooling pad ensures that the pad dips in the bottom water tank and rinses itself, shaking off the dust/foulants settled on it when coming alongwith the incoming air from louvers and passes through these pads, which can be on one or more sides.     :<br>
The invention also provides for a continual bleeding mechanism so that the foulants &amp; dust accumulated in water in the basin are regularly removed and fresh make up water added to replace the water lost in the process. This is achieved with the help of a belt, made of self-lubricating material (plastic) which is mounted on a sprocket at the top coupled to the mam motor and an idling bush situated at a circular depression at the bottom of the water basin connected to a drain. This belt has a small opening at one point. When the belt moves and this -hole synchronized with the circular depression in the water basin, it allows a fixed quantity of water to drain out. carrying along with it settled foulants &amp; dust. The discharged water quantitv is made up by the water supply line connected to a float valve. Thus the water purity in the desert cooler tank is maintained at a desirable level by regular purging of foulants &amp; dust and intake of fresh water<br>
I he invention also helps in eliminating the requirement of water pump, because the cooling pads wet themselves during their dip in the water, during their self-leaning process.<br><br>
The invention is explained with reference to the accompanying 2 sketches where in it show it desert cooler as per with invention.<br>
Referring to Sketch. The desert cooler has an outer body (1) having louvers (2) in its openable sides. The moving belt-like cooling pad (3) is mounted on a sprocket (4) which is driven by fractional H.P. Motor (5) mounted on the cooler body ceiling. An idling bush (6) is provided as the bottom, inside the water at the cooler body basin (7). For continual bleeding of foulants and dust rich water a belt (8) mounted on a sprocket (14) having a width of 20-40 mm as an example (without implying any limitations) keeps rotating with the help of the motor (5) and at the bottom. It is supported by an idling bush (9) with has perforations in it to allow free passage to water which has to drain out. This belt has opening (10) at one point only. When this opening (11) in the belt and the drain opening get synchronised ie. When these are face to face, their position automatically makes a certain quantity of dirty water to flushed out tlirough the drain. This discharged quantity of water is made up by the intake to make up water tlirough the float valve (12) connected to water supply line. Exhaust fan (13) provides for the flow the evaporatively cooled air into the room.<br>
Advantage:-<br>
The invention ensures continues cleaning of the cooling pads &amp; removal of foulants and accumulated dust which come from the ambient air, ensuring high filtration &amp; evaporating cooling efficiency.<br>
The invention also eliminates accumulation of foulants and dust in the recalculating water to ensure high evaporative cooling &amp; elimination of foul odour.<br>
The invention also eliminates need for a water pump, a frequently breaking down critical component of a desert cooler.<br>
Statements of Invention :-<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides Desert Cooler characterised by a moving cooling pad (3) mounted on a self lubricating belt (plastic material) and moving on sprocket (4) and an idling bush (6) ensures auto-clearing of the pad so as to maintain itself as an efficient evaporative cooling medium, a fan (13) which sucks air from outside and throws it into the space to be cooled, a belt (8) with an opening (10) which keeps moving supported on sprocket (14) and a perforated idling bush (9) comes face to face with idling bush (9) and the bottom opening (11) facilitates periodic discharge of accumulated mud, a top mounted motor (5) connected to sprockets (4 &amp; 14) to drive the belt (8) at the cooling pad, (3), a float valve arrangement (12) for make -up water and a housing body (1) with a water basin (7) at the bottom and having openings (2) on one or more sides for allowing outside air to enter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
