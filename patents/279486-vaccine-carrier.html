The present invention relates to novel hypoallergenlc molecules and uses thereof.<br>
Type I allergy is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity disease affecting almost 25% of the population. It is based on the recognition of harmless airborne, insect, venom, food allergen and contact allergen antigens derived from per se  harmless antigen sources such as pollen, insects, mold and animal proteins by specific immunoglobulin E. The crosslinking of effector cell-bound IgE antibodies leads to a release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, leucotrienes) and thus to the immediate symptoms of allergy (e.g., rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, dermatitis, anaphylaxis). T-cell activation via IgE-dependent as well as IgE-independent mechanisms contributes to chronic allergic inflammation.<br>
The probably only causative forms of allergy treatment is allergen-specific immunotherapy, which is based on the repeated administration of increasing amounts of allergen extracts for most sources. Numerous clinical studies have documented the clinical efficacy of injection immunotherapy and there is evidence for several immunological mechanisms underlying this treatment. Due to the difficulty to prepare high quality allergen extracts for certain allergen sources and the fact that the administration of allergens to patients can cause severe side effects, allergen-specific immunotherapy can only be recommended for certain patients groups and disease manifestations. It is especially difficult to treat patients with co-sensitizations to several different allergen sources and patients suffering from severe disease manifestations such as allergic asthma. Allergic asthma is one of the most vigorous manifestations of allergy, because it severely affects the quality of daily life, causes a high rate of hospitality admissions and can manifest itself in serious, life-threatening forms requiring intensive care of the patient.<br>
Allergen extracts prepared from natural allergen-sources are crude in nature, and it is impossible to influence the quality and amounts of individual allergens in such preparations by technical means. They also contain numerous undefined non-allergenic components, and several recent studies indicate the<br>
poor quality of such extracts and document their great heterogeneity.<br>
In the last decade great progress, has been made in the field of molecular allergen characterization using recombinant DNA technology. A large number of the most important disease-eliciting allergens has been characterized down to the molecular level, and recombinant allergens mimicking the epitope complexity of natural allergen extracts have been produced. Moreover, several research groups have "used the knowledge regarding allergen structures to develop defined new allergy vaccines. Genetic engineering, synthetic peptide chemistry and conjugation of allergens with immunostimulatory DNA sequences have been used to reduce the allergenic activity of the new vaccines and thus the rate of therapy-induced side effects. First promising clinical studies were conducted with such allergen derivatives. Interestingly, it turned out that although IgE-reactivity of genetically engineered recombinant allergens and allergen-derived synthetic T-cell epitope-containing peptides could be strongly reduced or even abolished, these derivatives still could induce systemic side effects appearing several hours after injection. For example, it was reported that T-cell epitope peptides of the major cat allergen, Fel d 1, induced asthma and bronchial hyper reactivity several hours after intracutaneous injection, and there is strong evidence that this effect is T-cell mediated and MHC-restricted.<br>
These results indicate that the removal of IgE-reactivity diminishes IgE-mediated side effects since no immediate reactions were recorded in the course of these immunotherapy studies. However, the allergen-specific T-cell epitopes which have been preserved in the recombinant allergen derivatives as well as in the peptide mixtures are responsible for the late side effects (e.g. very problematic or atopic dermatitis, chronic T cell-mediated allergic skin manifestation). The side effects caused in the case of recombinant allergen-derivatives were relatively mild and in the case of the T-cell peptide vaccines may be overcome by adequate dosing. Both of the two new approaches therefore seem very promising for immunotherapy of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis but may have limitations when it comes to the treatment of severe forms of allergic asthma, where the induction of late side effects in the lung may be very prob-<br>
lematic.<br>
In order to administer and consequently to provoke an efficient immune response against peptides, polypeptides and proteins, adjuvants and/or carriers are regularly used. Complete Freund's adjuvant, for instance, is one of the most potent adjuvants available. However, because of its side effects, its use is not approved for humans. Therefore, there exists a need for vaccine compositions able to induce strong immune responses against peptides and polypeptides derived from allergens and of course of other antigens avoiding the use of complete Freund's adjuvant. Further, while BSA has been used successfully as a carrier in animal models it may not be appropriate for use in human vaccine compositions because of the risk of adverse reactions such as the risk of transmitting prion disease (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). A further challenge to the development of an effective vaccine against allergens is the need for an immune response able to rapidly decrease allergens in an individual or animal. Therefore, high concentrations of allergen-specific antibodies in the blood, which are mainly of the IgG subtype, are needed. In mucosal surfaces IgA antibodies are the primary subtype.<br>
Cholera toxin, a known carrier protein in the art, is also used regularly as an adjuvant, eliminating the need for complete Freund's adjuvant in a vaccine composition. However, cholera toxin increases total and specific IgE.antibody levels and leads to IgE-associated inflammatory reactions.<br>
Due to the side effects provoked by most carrier proteins used for vaccination, there exists a need for carrier systems which are able to stimulate immune responses against allergens or other antigens, without using toxic adjuvants, without using poorly tolerated carrier proteins and, in certain situations, without stimulation of potentially pathologic immune responses. Novel carrier systems meeting these specifications can be used towards the formation of novel conjugates and compositions suitable for the treatment or prevention of diseases like allergic diseases.<br>
In Bohle B. et al. (J. Immunol. 172 (11) (2004): 6642-6648) a recombinant fusion protein comprising an S-layer protein moiety and Bet v 1 moiety is described. This molecule comprises the native hyperallergenic Bet v 1 protein.<br>
WO 2004/004761 relates to virus like particles which are fused to an immunogen and which may be used for immunisation.<br>
In WO 2004/003143 the use of fusion proteins comprising a virus like particle and a hyperallergenic molecule as immunogen for vaccination is disclosed.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide medicaments and carriers which overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and allow an allergen vaccination with reduced side effects.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a hypoallergenic protein consisting of at least one hypoallergenic molecule derived from an allergen, which is fused or conjugated to at least one second non-allergenic protein or fragment thereof.<br>
In order to provoke an enhanced immune response against a molecule, in particular of a hypoallergenic molecule according to the present invention, said molecule is fused (by genetic engineering) or conjugated (by chemical reactions) to a carrier. A conventional and regularly employed carrier is, for instance, KLH (Keyhole limpet hemocyanin). KLH, which is isolated from the giant sea mollusc Megathura crenulata, is one of the most popular carrier proteins used to create an immunogen for injection. KLH induces a strong antibody response because of its large mass and because it is a non-mammalian protein.<br>
The second protein (the "carrier" or "carrier protein") to be fused or conjugated to a hypoallergenic molecule of the invention is not derived from an allergen ("non-allergenic"). However, the carrier protein used in the present invention may exhibit T cell reactivity and/or provoke an immune response against itself and the hypoallergenic molecule fused or conjugated to it when administered to an animal or human body. Consequently, if the carrier protein is derived from a pathogen (e.g. virus, bacteria etc.), (protecting) antibodies directed to said carrier and pathogens are produced.<br>
As used herein, "hypoallergenic protein" means a fusion pro-tein/polypeptide of a carrier of a non-allergenic source with a hypoallergenic molecule. Furthermore, a "hypoallergenic protein" is also intended to be a conjugation product (e.g. chemical coupling, adsorption) of a carrier with a hypoallergenic molecule.<br>
"Hypoallergenic" as used herein, refers to molecules with reduced allergenic potential. Such molecules have a decreased capacity to provoke allergic reactions in an individual compared<br>
to the wild-type protein from which these molecules are derived.<br>
The at least one hypoallergenic molecule derived from an allergen and fused/conjugated to a second protein is preferably C-and/or N-terminally truncated. "O and/or N-terminal truncation", as used herein, means that amino acid residues either from the N-terminus or from the C-terminus or both from the N-and C-terminus of the wild-type allergen are removed by deletion of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30 amino acid residue s.<br>
The hypoallergenic molecules, i.e. peptides/polypeptides, comprise preferably 10 to 50 amino acids, more preferably 15 to 40 amino acids, in particular 20-30 amino acids and exhibit reduced IgE reactivity. These molecules are designed to exclude T-cell epitopes which may cause T-cell-mediated side effects. T-cell epitopes and molecules exhibiting reduced T-cell response may be determined and identified by methods known by the person skilled in the art (e.g., Bercovici N. et al. Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. (2000) 7:859-864).<br>
It was found that it is possible to design peptide vaccines derived from allergens like the major grass pollen allergens, e.g., Phi p 1, and for the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, using surface exposed peptides. The data obtained show that such peptide vaccines can be produced for any allergen whose primary structure is known according to IgE epitope mapping, three-dimensional structure data or computer-aided prediction of surface-exposed domains. However, the selection of suitable peptides which may be used for vaccination remains crucial, because not all peptides identified with these methods can be employed in vaccination. The peptides suitably used for vaccination purposes should exhibit reduced IgE-binding capacity and - in order to reduce or avoid late side effects - exhibit reduced T-cell reactivity.<br>
The term "derived from an allergen", as used herein, means that the hypoallergenic molecules according to the present invention are obtained directly from an allergen by fragmentation or truncation. The amino acid sequence of the hypoallergenic molecules of the present invention are preferably at least 80% identical, more preferably at least 90% identical, most preferably at least 95% identical, in particular 100% identical, to the amino sequence stretch of the wild-type allergen, from which the<br>
hypoallergenic molecule is derived. However, the molecules which are not 100% identical to the wild-type allergen fragments should be able to bind with at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, most preferably at least 90%, strength to an antibody or to antibodies, preferably to IgG antibodies, which are directed to said wild-type allergen fragments .<br>
The degree of identity of a first amino acid sequence to a second amino acid can be determined by a direct comparison between both amino acid sequences using certain algorithms. Such algorithms are, for instance, incorporated in various computer programs (e.g. "BLAST-2 SEQUENCES (blastp)" (Tatusova et al. (1999) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 174:247-25; Corpet F, Nucl. Acids Res. (1988) 16:10881-10890).<br>
The truncated molecules according to the present invention can be defined as being parts of the complete allergen that induce less activation of allergen-specific T cells than the complete wild-type allergen ( preferably at least a 30%, more preferably at least a 50%, most preferably at least a 70%, reduction) , exhibit a more than 50% reduced (preferably more than 7 0%) allergenic activity as evaluated by IgE binding assays and ability to induce IgE-mediated cell activation and when coupled to a carrier as described induce IgG antibodies which inhibit the binding of polyclonal IgE from allergic patients to the complete wild-type allergen.<br>
The peptides should contain sequences from the allergens to avoid overlaps with the mimotopes. Mimotopes, however, which are small peptide mimics (less than 15 amino acids) of antigen pieces and are obtained from random peptide libraries do not represent original, allergen-derived molecules as defined herein. They can not be used according to the invention because they are too small to induce a robust blocking IgG response.<br>
The hypoallergenic molecules according to the present invention may be obtained by recombinant methods or chemical synthesis. Alternatively, it is, of course, also possible to obtain the molecules by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the wild-type allergen or a polypeptide/protein harbouring the molecule of interest.<br>
The hypoallergenic molecule may comprise preferably at least two truncated allergen molecules derived from at least one<br>
allergen, wherein the order of the truncated allergen fragments differs from the order of the fragments in the wild-type allergen if the at least two molecules are derived from the same allergen.<br>
The hypoallergenic molecule according to the present invention may comprise one or more (preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 3) hypoallergenic molecules as defined herein, thus, resulting in a fusion protein. The single hypoallergenic molecules of the fusion protein, which, of course, also lacks IgE-binding capacity and lacks T-cell epitopes, may be derived from allergens of the same and/or of different origin. If the molecules are derived from the same allergen, the order in the hypoallergenic fusion protein should not be identical to the order in the wild-type allergen (this prevents the reconstitution and formation of IgE-binding sites) (see, e.g., WO20G4/065414, Linhart B and Valenta R (Int Arch Allergy Immunol. (2004) 134:324-31)).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the at least one hypoallergenic molecule is fused to the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of said at least one second protein or fragment thereof.<br>
The allergen or fragments thereof may be conjugated chemically, e.g., or by recombinant methods to each other. If the allergen or fragment thereof is conjugated chemically to a carrier, said allergen or fragment should be provided with a terminal cysteine residue (resulting in a free sulfhydryl group). To said terminal (N- or C-terminal) cysteine residue any maleimide-activated carrier protein may be conjugated, thus creating an immunogen/carrier complex. If the allergen or fragment thereof does not*have a sulfhydryl group at a terminus, EDC (l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride) chemistry in order to couple amines (lysine) or carboxylic acids (glutamic, aspartic acid or 5'-phosphate) to the carrier protein may be employed.<br>
If the hypoallergenic molecule fused to the N- or C-terminus of the carrier, recombinant methods are employed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the at least one second protein is a viral, in particular RNA or DNA viral, bacterial fungal or protozoal protein.<br>
The at least one second protein ("carrier") may be of any of<br>
the above-mentioned origin. It is, however, in particular preferred to use proteins which provoke an immune response against the protein itself and the hypoallergenic molecule fused or conjugated thereto. Due to the induction of formation of (protective) antibodies directed also to the at least one second protein, the hypoallergenic protein according to the present invention may also be employed as vaccine for said second protein and its originating source (e.g. virus, bacteria, fungus). Of course it is also possible to use carrier proteins well known in the art (e.g. KLH) as the at least second protein.<br>
The viral protein according to the present invention is preferably a capsid protein.<br>
Viral capsid proteins are especially suited because they induce antiviral activity, provoke the formation of antibodies which block adhesion of viruses, e.g. rhinoviruses, to epithelial cells, exhibit an immuno-modulatory activity towards a Thl response, increase the immunogenicity of the peptide (i.e., higher anti-peptide and hence higher levels of protective IgG antibodies), are suited and proved for prophylactic vaccination (virus vaccination) and are safe, when capsid proteins are used to whose humans are continuously exposed (e.g. rhinoviruses).<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the at least one viral capsid protein is derived from a human pathogenic virus, preferably a virus of the family of pi-cornaviridae.<br>
The virus of the family of picornaviridae is preferably of the genus of rhinoviruses, preferably of the species of human rhinoviruses, in particular human rhinovirus 89 and 14. The capsid protein may be VP1, VP2, VP3 and/or VP4.<br>
The allergen to be fused to a viral capsid protein is preferably selected from the group consisting of major birch pollen allergens, in particular Bet v 1 and Bet v 4, major timothy grass pollen allergens, in particular Phi p 1, Phi p 2, Phi p 5, Phi p 6 and Phi p 7, major house dust mite allergens, in particular Der p 1 and Der p 2, major cat allergen Fel d 1, major bee allergens, major wasp allergens, profilins, especially Phi p 12, and storage mite allergens, especially Lep d 2.<br>
Other suited allergens to be used according to the present invention can be derived from the following table.<br>

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the hypoallergenic molecule exhibits reduced IgE-binding capacity.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the hypoallergenic molecule exhibits reduced T-cell reactivity.<br>
However, also allergen fragments comprising at least one T-cell epitope may be used in the hypoallergenic protein according to the present invention.<br>
"Exhibiting reduced IgE-binding capacity", as used herein, means that the molecules according to the present invention show significantly reduced IgE-binding capacity or activity (at least 50% less, preferably at least 70% less,'more preferably at least 80% less, even more preferably at least 90% less, most preferably at least 95% less, binding capacity compared to the wild-type allergen) or even lack them at all.<br>
IgE-binding activity/capacity of molecules like peptides and proteins can be determined by, for example, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using, for example, sera obtained from a subject, (i.e., an allergic subject) that has been previously exposed to the wild-type allergen. Briefly, a peptide to be tested is coated onto wells of a microtiter plate. After washing and blocking the wells, an antibody solution consisting of the plasma of an allergic subject, who has been exposed to the peptide being tested or the protein from which it was derived, is incubated in the wells. A labelled secondary antibody is added to the wells and incubated. The amount of IgE-binding is then quantified and compared to the amount of IgE bound by a purified wild-type allergen.<br>
Alternatively, the binding activity of a peptide can be determined by Western blot analysis. For example, a peptide to be tested is run on a polyacrylamide gel using SDS-PAGE. The peptide is then transferred to nitrocellulose and subsequently incubated with serum from an allergic subject. After incubation with the labelled secondary antibody, the amount of IgE bound is determined and quantified.<br>
Another assay which can be used to determine IgE-binding activity of a peptide is a competition ELISA assay. Briefly, an IgE-antibody pool is generated by combining plasma from allergic subjects who have been shown by direct ELISA to be IgE-reactive with wild-type allergen. This pool is used in ELISA competition assays to compare IgE-binding to wild-type allergen to the peptide tested. IgE-binding for the wild-type allergen and the pep-<br>
tide being tested is determined and quantified.<br>
A "T-cell epitope" means a protein (e.g., allergen) or fragment thereof, for which a T-cell has an antigen specific binding site, the result of binding to said binding site activates the T-cell. The term "exhibiting reduced T-cell reactivity", as used herein, refers to molecules which exhibit a T-cell reactivity which is significantly reduced compared to the stimulation induced by the wild-type allergen from which the hypoallergenic molecule is derivedusing equimolar amounts in standard assays known in the art (reduced T-cell reactivity means at least 30%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 70%, most preferably at least 90%, less stimulation of hypoallergenic molecules compared to the wildtype allergen at equimolar amounts). In a particular preferred embodiment of this invention, the molecules may "lack" T-cell epitopes and thus molecule shows reduced T-cell  reactivity in the individual(s) to be treated (i.e., who is to receive an epitope-presenting valency platform molecule). It is likely that, for example, an allergen-derived molecule may lack a T-cell epitope(s) with respect to an individual, or a group of individuals, while possessing a T-cell epitope(s) with respect to other individual(s). Methods for detecting the presence of a T-cell epitope are known in the art and include assays which detect T-cell proliferation (such as thymidine incorporation). . Immunogens that fail to induce statistically significant incorporation of thymidine above background (i.e., generally p less than 0.05 using standard statistically methods) are generally considered to lack T-cell epitopes, although it will be appreciated that the quantitative amount of thymidine incorporation may vary, depending on the immunogen being tested (see, e.g., Zhen L. et al. (Infect Immun. (2 003) 71:3920-3926)). Generally, a stimulation index below about 2-3, more preferably less than about 1, indicates lack of T-cell reactivity and epitopes. The presence of T-cell epitopes can also be determined by measuring secretion of T-cell-derived lymphoki-nes according to standard methods. The stimulation index (SI) may be calculated by dividing the proliferation rate (Thymidine uptake) of stimulated cells through the proliferation rate of unstimulated cells in medium alone. SI=1 means no stimulation, SKI indicates toxic effects and SI&gt;1 indicates stimulation of cells. Location and content of T-cell epitopes, if present, can<br>

erably about 1 month, to effect immunization. The antibody is recovered by collecting blood from the immunized animal after the passage of 1 to 2- weeks after the last administration, cen-trifuging the blood and isolating serum from the blood.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may, e.g., be of human or murine origin. Murine monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by the method of Kohler and Milstein (Kohler, G. and Milstein, C, Nature 256 (1975) 4 95), e.g., by fusion of spleen cells of hyperimmunized mice with an appropriate mouse myeloma cell line.<br>
A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See, e.g., Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., (1989) J. Immunol. Methods 125:191-202; US 5,807,715; US 4,816,567 and US 4,816,397.<br>
Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from a non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modelling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions (see, e.g., Queen et al., US 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988)). Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; WO 91/09967; US 5,225,539; US 5,530,101; and US 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4/5):489-498 (1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska. et al., PNAS 91:969-913 (1994)), and chain shuffling (US 5,565,332).<br>
The antibodies according to the present invention may advan-<br>

It is noted that the clone 30 allergen is an allergen derived from the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and consists of the following sequence:<br>
MANDNDDDPTTTVHPTTTEQPDDKFECPSRFGYFADPKDPHKFYICSNWEAVHKDCPGNTRWNE DEETCT (SEQ ID No. 140; see also AT A 733/2006).<br>
According to the present invention also peptides are encompassed which are at least 80% identical, preferably 90% identical, to the amino sequences disclosed above.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a fused hypoallergenic protein according to the present invention.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule according to the present invention.<br>
Said vector is preferably an expression vector.<br>
The vector harbouring the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention may be used for cloning purposes or for the production of expression vectors. Said vector can be a plasmid, cosmid, virus, bacteriophage or any other vector commonly used in genetic engineering, and can include, in addition to the nucleic acid molecule of the invention, eukaryotic or prokaryotic elements for the control of the expression, such as regulatory sequences for the initiation and the termination of the transcription and/or translation, enhancers, promoters, signal sequences and the like.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the vector is a bacterial, fungal, insect, viral or mammalian vector.<br>
The vector of the present invention may preferably be employed for cloning and expression purposes in various hosts. Therefore, said vector comprises besides a nucleic acid encoding for a hypoallergenic molecule or fusion protein according to the present invention host specific regulatory sequences.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a host comprising a nucleic acid molecule or a vector according to the present invention.<br>
The nucleic acid molecule and the vector according to the present invention may be introduced into a suitable host. Said molecule may be incorporated into the genome of the host. The vector may exist extrachromosomally in the cytoplasm or incorpo-<br>
rated into the chromosome of the host.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to an antibody directed against a hypoallergenic molecule, hypoaller-genic fusion protein or a fusion protein according to the present invention.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the antibody is a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody.<br>
Antibodies according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab') fragments and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. Furthermore, antibodies are considered to be immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention are preferably of the types IgG, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY, class (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule.<br>
Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by administering a polypeptide of the invention, preferably using an adjuvant, to a non-human mammal and collecting the resultant antiserum. Improved titers can be obtained by repeated injections over, a period of time. There is no particular limitation to the species of mammals which may be used for eliciting antibodies; it is generally preferred to use rabbits or guinea pigs, but horses, cats, dogs, goats, pigs, rats, cows, sheep, camels etc., can also be used. In the production of antibodies, a definite amount of immunogen of the invention is, e.g., diluted with physiological saline solution to a suitable concentration, and the resulting diluted solution is mixed with, e.g., complete Freund's adjuvant to prepare a suspension or with mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and corynebacte-rium parvum. The suspensions and mixtures are administered to mammals, e.g., intraperitoneally, e.g., to a rabbit, using from about 50 ug to about 2,500 ug polypeptide of the invention per administration. The suspension is preferably administered about every two weeks over a period of up to about 2-3 months, pref-<br>
tageously be used for desensitization of an individual suffering from an allergy, in particular from house dust mite allergy. For passive immunisation the antibody is preferably an IgG or a derivative thereof (e.g., chimeric or humanized antibody). Furthermore, this antibody may also be used for desensibilisation of an individual.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a vaccine formulation comprising a hypoallergenic protein or an antibody according to the present invention.<br>
The vaccine formulation according to the present invention may be formulated as known in the art and necessarily adapted to the way of administration of said vaccine formulation.<br>
Preferred ways of administration of the vaccine formulation (of the present invention) include all standard administration regimes described and suggested for vaccination in general and allergy immunotherapy specifically (orally, transdermally, in-traveneously, intranasally, via mucosa, rectally, etc). However, it is particularly preferred to administer the molecules and proteins according to the present invention subcutaneously or intramusculary.<br>
The vaccine formulation according to the present invention may only comprise a viral capsid protein or fragments thereof of a member of the genus of rhinvovirus<br>
Said formulation preferably further comprises at least one adjuvant, pharmaceutical acceptable excipient and/or preservative .<br>
In order to increase the immunogenicity of the hypoallergenic molecules according to the present invention, adjuvants, for instance, may be used in a medicament according to the present invention. An adjuvant according to the present invention is an auxiliary agent which, when administered together or in parallel with an antigen, increases its immunogenicity and/or influences the quality of the immune response. Hence, the adjuvant can, e.g., considerably influence the extent of the humoral or cellular immune response. Customary adjuvants are, e.g., aluminum compounds, lipid-containing compounds or inactivated mycobacteria.<br>
Generally, adjuvants can be of different forms, provided that they are suitable for administration to human beings. Further examples of such adjuvants are oil emulsions of mineral or<br>
sent invention is administered is preferably an individual or animal which is at risk to become an allergy.<br>
Subjects having or at risk of having an allergic condition, disorder or disease include subjects with an existing allergic condition'or a known or a suspected predisposition towards developing a symptom associated with or caused by an allergic condition. Thus, the subject can have an active chronic allergic condition, disorder or disease, an acute allergic episode, or a latent allergic condition, di'sorder or disease. Certain allergic conditions are associated with seasonal or geographical environmental factors. Thus, at risk subjects include those at risk from suffering from a condition based upon a prior personal or family history, and the season or physical location, but which the condition or a symptom associated with the condition may not presently manifest itself in the subject.<br>
The administration of the medicament according to the present invention, which comprises at least one hypoallergenic molecule as described herein, to an individual may prevent sensitization of said individual or may induce an appropriate immune response to allergens. If the medicament of the present invention is used to prevent sensitization, it should be administered to an individual prior to the first contact with said allergen. Therefore, it is preferred to administer the medicament according to the present invention to neonates and children. It turned out that also the administration of the medicament according to the present invention to pregnant individuals will induce the formation of antibodies directed against allergens in the unborn child. It is especially beneficiary to use hypoallergenic molecules according to the present invention for such therapies, because due to the lack of T-cell epitopes side effects occurring in the course of allergen immunotherapy can significantly be reduced or even be completely avoided.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to the use of a hypoallergenic protein or an antibody according to the present invention for the diagnosis of an allergy and/or a viral infection in an individual.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to the use a viral capsid protein from a virus of the family of picornaviri-dae as a carrier in medicaments or vaccines or for diagnosing a viral infection, in particular common cold.<br>
As a valuable alternative to the widely spread KLH carrier protein viral capsid proteins of viruses of the family of picor-naviridae may be used. The carrier may be conjugated chemically or fused with recombinant techniques to peptides, proteins and polypeptides or other antigens. Furthermore, the viral capsid protein may be used to detect, e.g., antibodies directed to said capsid protein in the serum of an individual.<br>
One of the advantages of such a carrier is that not only the antigen fused or conjugated thereon may be exposed to the immune system, but also an immune response against the capsid protein of a rhinovirus is induced. Consequently, such a vaccination leads to the prevention and/or treatment of diseases caused by rhinoviruses. The virus is preferably of the species of human rhinoviruses, in particular human rhinovirus 89 and 14.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a hypoal-lergenic molecule derived from Phi p 5 (Genbank Nr. X7435) having a C- and/or N-terminal truncation and lacking substantially IgE-binding capacity.<br>
Grass pollen is one of most potent outdoor seasonal sources of airborne allergens responsible for hay fever and allergic asthma.<br>
More than 40% of allergic individuals display IgE-reactivity with grass pollen allergens, which are divided into more than 11 groups. More than 80% of the grass pollen allergic patients react with group 5 allergens.<br>
Group 5 allergens are non-glycosylated, highly homologous proteins with a molecular mass range from 25-33kD. Several group 5 allergens have been cloned and/or immunologically characterized.<br>
The trial to reduce the allergenic activity by introducing pointmutations, mutations of several amino acids in row or deletions showed no effect (Schramm G, et al. J Immunol 1999; 162: 2406-1435). IgE-binding regions of Phi p 5 (Flicker S, et al. J Immunol 2000; 165: 3849-3859) have already been described and the three-dimensional structure has been solved (Maglio O, et al. 2002. Protein Eng. 15:635-642).<br>
It turned out that in particular the Phi p 5 peptides according to the present invention, which are C- and/or N-terminally truncated and lack IgE-binding capacity, may be employed for the active vaccination of individuals.<br>
ccording to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the truncated molecule lacks T-cell epitopes.<br>
As already outlined above, late side effects of allergen immunotherapy can be significantly reduced or even be avoided if the hypoallergenic molecules substantially lack T-cell epitopes.<br>
Truncated Phi p 5 molecules lacking T-cell epitopes are composed of amino acids 93 to 128, 98 to 128, 26 to 53, 26 to 58 or 252 to 283 of Phi p 5 or fragments or sequence variations thereof.<br>
In particular these truncated molecules substantially show no T-cell epitopes and are, nevertheless, able to provoke an appropriate immune response directed against the wild-type allergen.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the hypoallergenic truncated Phi p 5 is composed of amino acids 132 to 162, 217 to 246 or 176 to 212 of Phi p 5 or sequence variations thereof.<br>
These hypoallergenic molecules comprise one or more T-cell epitopes but lack IgE-binding capacity.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a hypoallergenic molecule derived from Fel d 1 (Genbank Nr. X62477 and X62 478) having a C- and/or N-terminal truncation and lacking IgE-binding capacity.<br>
Allergies to animals affect up to 40% of allergic patients. In the domestic environment, allergies to the most popular pets, cats and dogs, are particularly prevalent and connected with perennial symptoms. Animal allergens are present in dander, epithelium, saliva, serum or urine. Exposure to the allergens can occur either by direct skin contact or by inhalation of particles carrying the allergens. The major cat and dog allergens were shown to be present widespread and could even be detected in non-pet owning households and in public places, e.g., schools. This can be attributed to the high and increasing number of households keeping pets in industrialized countries (about 50%) and the high stability of the allergens, which are carried off and distributed.<br>
Fel d 1 was identified as the major cat allergen, which is recognized by more than 90% of cat allergic patients. Fel d 1 represents a 38 kDa acidic glycoprotein of unknown biological function. It consists of two identical non-covalently linked<br>
Fel d 2, amino acids 19 to 58, 52 to 91, 82 to 119, 106 to 144 or 139 to 180 of Can f 2, amino acids 19 to 56, 51 to 90, 78 to 118, 106 to 145 or 135-174 of Can f 1, amino acids 27 to 70, 70 to 100 or 92 to 132 of Art v 1, amino acids 31 to 70, 80 to 120, 125 to 155, 160 to 200, 225 to 263, 264 to 300 305 to 350 or 356 to 396 of Amb a 1, amino acids 1 to 34, 35 to 74, 74 to 115, 125 to 165, 174 to 213, 241 to 280, 294 to 333, 361 to 400 or 401 to 438 of Alt a 6, amino acids 1 to 40, 41 to 80, 81 to 120, 121 to 160 of Alt a 2 or fragments or sequence variations thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a hypoal-lergenic fusion protein comprising at least two hypoallergenic molecules according to the present invention exhibiting reduced IgE-binding capacity and exhibiting optionally reduced T-cell reactivity.<br>
The hypoallergenic molecules of the present invention which are derived from an allergen and lack IgE-binding capacity may be fused recombinantly or conjugated chemically to each other. As single components (allergen fragments) of the fusion pro-tein/polypeptide also said fusion protein/polypeptide lacks IgE- . binding capacity.<br>
The fusion protein according to the present invention may comprise at least two, preferably at least three, more preferably at least four, even more preferably at least five, hypoallergenic molecules according to the present invention. It is, of course, also possible to fuse the hypoallergenic molecules to other peptides, polypeptides and proteins not derived from allergens. These peptides, polypeptides and proteins may when administered to an individual also induce an immunologic reaction or may act as a carrier or exhibit enzymatic activities. The hypoallergenic molecules in the fusion protein according to the present invention may be coupled directly to each other or via a linker which is preferably composed of - amino acid residues.<br>
Methods for the production of fusion proteins are well known in the art and can be found in standard molecular biology references such as Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) and Ausubel et al. (Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd ed; Wiley and Sons, 1995). In general, a fusion protein is produced by first constructing a fusion gene which is inserted into a suitable expression vector, which is, in turn, used to transfect a suitable hosT-cell. In<br>
heterodimers, which, again, are composed of two polypeptide chains antiparallely linked by three disulfide bonds. Chain 1 and chain 2 are encoded on different genes, each consisting of 3 exons. Recombinant Fel d 1 (rFel d 1), expressed as a chain 2 -to chain 1 fusion protein, has been generated in E.   coli.   This recombinant Fel d 1 is able to completely mimick the immunological properties of the wild-type allergen.<br>
Peptides derived from the major cat allergen Fel d 1, and lacking IgE-binding capacity are suitable, e.g., for immunotherapy and prophylactic allergy vaccination. These peptides may be comprised in a larger polypeptide or be coupled to a suitable carrier protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides - like the Phi p 5 and allergen-derived peptides disclosed herein - are capable of inducing an IgG response, i.e., the production of so called "blocking antibodies" or "protective antibodies". These antibodies prevent IgE-binding to the allergen Fel d 1. A significant reduction in allergic symptoms may thus be achieved.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the truncated molecule exhibits reduced T-cell reactivity.<br>
In order to avoid or to significantly reduce late side effects the Fel d 1 derived hypoallergenic molecule exhibits reduced T-cell reactivity as defined in the present invention.<br>
The truncated Fel d 1 is preferably composed of amino acids 1 to 34 or 35 to 70 of chain 1 of Fel d 1, amino acids 1 to 34, 35 to 63 or 64 to 92 of chain 2 of Fel d 1 or sequence variations thereof.<br>

Another aspect of the present invention relates to the use of a hypoallergenic molecule, a fusion protein or an antibody according to the present invention for diagnosing an allergy or monitoring the progress of an allergy therapy in an individual.<br>
general, recombinant fusion constructs are produced by a series of restriction enzyme digestions and ligation reactions which result in the desired sequences being incorporated into a plas-mid. If suitable restriction sites are not available, synthetic oligonucleotide adapters or linkers can be used as is known by those skilled in the art and described in the references cited above. The polynucleotide sequences encoding allergens and native proteins can be assembled prior to insertion into a suitable vector or the sequence encoding the allergen can be inserted adjacent to a sequence encoding a native sequence already present in a vector. Insertion of the sequence within the vector should be in frame so that the sequence can be transcribed into a protein. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the precise restriction enzymes, linkers and/or adaptors required as well as the precise reaction conditions will vary with the sequences and cloning vectors used. The assembly of DNA constructs, however, is routine in the art and can be readily accomplished by a person skilled in the art.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the molecules are fused to each other in an order differing from the order of the fragments in the wild-type allergen if the at least two molecules are derived from the same allergen.<br>
The fusion protein according to the present invention may comprise at least two hypoallergenic molecules which are derived from the same wild-type allergen. In such a case the single molecules (allergen fragments) are fused to each other in an order differing from the order in the wild-type allergen. Such an approach prevents the re-formation of potential IgE-binding sites/epitopes in the hypoallergenic fusion protein.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a nucleic acid molecule coding for a hypoallergenic molecule and a fusion protein according to the present invention.<br>
The nucleic acid molecule of the present invention may be employed, e.g., for producing said molecules recombinantly.<br>
Said nucleic acid molecule may - according to another aspect of the present invention - be comprised in a vector.<br>
This vector is preferably an expression vector.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a vaccine formulation comprising a hypoallergenic molecule, a fusion protein or an antibody according to the present invention.<br>
The hypoallergenic molecule, fusion protein or antibody according to the present invention may not only be used in medicaments but can also be suitably employed for various diagnostic purposes. For instance, these molecules and fusion proteins may be used for diagnosing an allergy by exposing, e.g., a sample of an individual comprising histamine releasing cells to said polypeptide (see, e.g., Purohit et al., Clin.Exp.Allergy 35 (2005): 186-192). Furthermore, these molecules, fusion proteins and antibodies may be immobilized oh a surface in order to form a polypeptide array/chip. Such arrays may be used, e.g., in high throughput screening in order to diagnose an allergy in a number of samples taken from a number of individuals.<br>

EXAMPLES:<br>
Example  1:   Construction of vector p89VPl<br>
Virus stock samples were: prepared for RT-PCR by addition of lul of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer GmbH, Germany) to a final concentration of 0.01 U/ul after RNA extraction from cell culture supernatants by QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Germany).<br>
Plasmid p89VPl (Fig. 1A) was constructed by replacing the Ndel/EcoRI fragment of the multiple cloning site of pET-17b with the cDNA sequence encoding for the VP1 protein of human rhinovi-rus strain 89 (89VP1). The Ndel and EcoRI restriction sites (in pET-17b) were used for insertion of Asel/EcoRI linked 89VP1 with ATG at the 5'lend, six histidin followed by the stop-codon TGA at the 3' end (Fig.IB).<br>
The insertion of 89VP1 in pET-17b was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.<br>
After Ndel/Asel fusion instead of the Ndel site CATAAT was created and could not be cut with any available enzyme. Therefore, the site was mutated to CTTAAG, the restriction site of Afl II. To insert a further allergen fragment, the ACCGTT sequence at the 3' end was mutated to ACCGGT, the restriction site of Agel. The amino acid sequences are displayed below the nucleotide sequences of 89VP1. The restriction sites are shown underlined in Fig. IB.<br>
Said Afl II and Agel restriction sites were created with the Quick change site mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).<br>
cDNAs for gene fragments can thus be inserted for easy purification into the remaining restrictions sites either at the 5' end (using Afl II) or at the 3' end (using Agel) of 89VP1 or into both sites as indicated in Figure 1C. Recombinant allergen fragments will thus be expressed at the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus of the 89VP1.<br>

(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
Example  2:   Cloning of a  construct expressing a   89VP1-allergen fragment fusion protein<br>
The approach described above was exemplified for a C-terminal Ph1 p 1 allergen fragment, namely peptide 5 (CVRYT-TEGGTKTEAEDVIPEGWKADTAYESK; M. Focke et al. FASEB J (2001) 15:2042-4). The peptide 5 DNA sequence was amplified by PCR using the Ph1 p 1 cDNA (GenBank: X78813) as a template (Primers: Ph1 p 1 forward 5'-CGCGCTTAAGATGGTCCGCTACACCACCGAGGGC-3' (SEQ ID No. 7); Ph1 p 1 reverse 5'-CGCGCTTAAGCTTGGACTCGTAGGCGGTGTCGGC-3' (SEQ ID No. 8)). The PCR product was inserted into the Afl II restriction site of the p89VPl vector, and the resulting construct is referred to as vector p89P5 and gene product r89P5.<br>
Example  3:  Expression  and purification  of 89VP1 peptide 5-fusion protein  and 89VP1<br>
In order to achieve expression of 89VP1 or r89P5 (recombinant 89VPl-peptide 5 fusion protein), plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) . Transformed E. coli cells were grown in 250 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/1 ampicillin at 37°C to an optical density (600nm) of 0.4, and protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactosidase (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. E. coli cells were harvested after 4 hours by centrifugation at 3500 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. Purification was performed with the Qiagen protocol using Qiagen<br>
Ni-NTA and columns. The cell pellet was resuspended under denaturing conditions in 5 ml 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride for 1 hour. After centrifugation (20 min, 10000 x g) the supernatant was incubated with 1 ml Ni-NTA for an additional hour. The suspension was then loaded on a column, washed twice with 5 ml wash buffer (8 M urea pH 6.3) and then eluted with 4 ml elution buffer (8 M urea pH 3.5). Renaturation was achieved after dialysis with decreasing molarity of urea.<br>
Purity and size of the purified protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Figure 2. Protein bands correlated with the calculated protein size of 33.6 kD. Integrity of the proteins was also confirmed by Western blot analysis, using anti-histidine tag antibody.<br>
Example  4:   Detection of 14VPl-specific  rabbit antibodies by immunoblotting<br>
5 ug 14VP1 (VP1 protein of the human rhinovirus strain 14) and controls (Bet v 1, Ph1 p 5, BSA) were dotted onto nitrocellulose membrane strips. These strips were exposed to a dilution of rabbit anti-14VPl antiserum (lane 1-6) and preimmune serum (lane 8-12). Bound rabbit IgG antibodies were detected with 1251-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG 1:1000 and visualized by autoradiography (Fig.3).<br>
Dot blot analysis of rabbit anti-14 VP1 serum shows that 14VP1 is strongly immunogenic. IgG antibodies were still detected with a 1:16000 dilution of the antiserum in contrast to the preimmune serum and the Bet v 1, Ph1 p 5 and BSA controls.<br>
Example 5:   89VP1-specific antibody response  in  immunized mice determined by ELISA<br>
In order to determine the immunogenicity of 89VP1 and its ability to act as a carrier for peptide 5, groups of six week old female balb/c mice (Charles River) were immunized with the following antigens: KLH, KLH maleimide coupled peptide 5 (KLHP5) and KLH EDC coupled peptide 5 (KLHP5edc). The chemical coupling was made with the Imject maleimide activated mcKLH and Imject Immunogen EDC Kit (Pierce). The maleimide group reacts with SH groups and the EDC reacts with carboxyl and amino groups to form stable bonds. Groups of 4 mice were immunized with 89VP1, r8 9P5 and 89P5edc and 2 mice were immunized with peptide 5 only (5 ug each and mixed 1:2 with aluminium hydroxide). The mice were immunized subcutaneously in approximately three-week intervals and<br>
bled from the tail veins. The 89VPl-specific IgGl antibody level was determined by ELISA.<br>
ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated with 5  µg/ml 89VP1. The mice anti-89VPl, anti- r89P5 and peptide 5 sera were diluted 1:500. Bound IgGl was detected with rat anti-mouse IgGl (BD Pharmingen) 1:1000 and then with goat anti rat IgG POX-coupled (Amersham Biosciehce) 1:2000. The optical value (OD 405nm) is displayed on the y-axis and corresponds to the level of IgGl antibody in the mouse sera (Fig.4).<br>
KLHP5, KLHP5edc, KLH and peptide 5 were used as controls. IgGl antibodies were detected with an increasing titer during immunization in mice injected with 89VP1 (89VP1, 89P5edc and r89P5). Rabbits immunized with 89VP1, r8 9P5 and KLHP5 show the same result.<br>
Example   6:   rPhl p 1-specific antibody response in  immunized mice determined by ELISA<br>
To evaluate whether immunization with r89P5 will induce IgG antibodies that react with complete Ph1 p 1, the same method and the same mice sera were used as described in example 5. ELISA plates were coated with 5  µg/ml rPhl p 1 and the IgGl antibody titer was determined (Fig.5).<br>
All Ph1 p 1 derived peptides either coupled to KLH or 89VP1 induced rPhl p 1 specific IgGl antibodies with increasing responses during immunizations. Rabbits immunized with r8 9P5 and . KLHP5 show the same result.<br>
Example   7:   ELISA detection  of timothy grass pollen  extract-specific  IgGl  antibodies<br>
Immunization of mice and ELISA analysis was performed as described in section 5. Whole timothy grass pollen extract was coated (100  µg/ml) on ELISA plates and the IgGl antibody titer was determined (Fig.6).<br>
After three immunizations extract-specific IgGl antibodies could be detected in mice immunized with peptide 5.<br>
Example   8:   Rabbit  anti-r89P5  antibodies block patient's  IgE-binding to  rPhl p  1<br>
To determine the ability of peptide-induced rabbit Ig to inhibit the binding of allergic patients' IgE antibodies to rPhl p 1, ELISA plates were coated with l µg/ml rPhl p 1, washed and blocked. The plates were preincubated with 1:100-diluted rabbit anti- peptide (89P5, KLHP5),• a rabbit anti rPhl p 1 and,<br>
for control purposes, with the corresponding preimmune sera. After washing, plates were incubated with human sera from Ph1 p 1-allergic patients (1:3 diluted) and bound IgE was detected with mouse anti-human IgE (Pharmingen 1:1000) and then with sheep anti-mouse IgG POX-coupled (Amersham Bioscience) 1:2000. The percentage of inhibition of IgE-binding achieved by preincubation with the anti- peptide antisera was calculated as follows: 100-ODi/ODp x 100.<br>
ODi and ODp represent the extinctions after preincubation with the rabbit immune and preimmune serum, respectively. Table 2 shows the capacity of anti-Ph1 p 1 peptide antibodies to inhibit the binding of 19 allergic patients' IgE to complete rPhl p 1. Figure 7 displays the mean inhibition (in %) of all anti- rPhl p 1, anti-r89P5 and anti-KLHP5 immune sera. Anti-peptide sera blocked the IgE-binding much better then rPhl p 1. The ability for inhibition is with 89P5 and KLHP5 almost alike. Table 2 shows the inhibition (in %) of all 19 patients.<br>

Example  9:   T-cell proliferation  of mouse  spleen  cells  after antigen  stimulation<br>
Groups of three mice were immunized with KLH, KLHP5 and KLHP5edc. Groups of 4 mice were immunized four times with 8 9VP1, r8 9P5 and 8 9P5edc, and 2 mice were immunized with peptide 5 only (5 ug each). Spleen cells were taken 10 days after the last immunization and single cell cultures were stimulated in triplicates in 96 well plates with peptide 5 (P5) , 89VP1, KLH, Con A<br>
and a medium as a positive and negative control, respectively.<br>
3 After four days radioactive [ H]thymidine 0.5 uCi was added to<br>
each well. Cells were then harvested with a Packard Cell Harvester onto unifilter plates after 15 hours. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a beta-counter. Stimulation indices where calculated and are shown at the y-axis. The antigen which was used for stimulation is shown on the x-axis. Each box represents the data of the antigen which was used for immunization of the mice (Fig. 8). All values above two count as positive. The KLH and KLHP5 immunized mice are only positive when stimulated with KLH and the peptide 5 mice are completely negative. The KLHP5edc group is also negative which corresponds to the ELISA results. Cells from r89P5, 89P5edc and 89VP1 immunized mice proliferated only after stimulation with 89VP1. The naive . control mouse shows no proliferation in all cases. These results show that T-cell epitopes are provided by the carrier 8 9VP1 and not by the peptide 5.<br>
Example  10:   Detection  of 14VP1-,   89VP1- and rPhl p  1-specific antibodies  in human sera  obtained in  autumn and winter by ELISA<br>
Five human sera of randomly chosen persons were taken in autumn and five in winter. The IgGl, IgG2, IgG4 and IgA antibody level against 14VP1, 89VP1 and rPhl p 1 was determined by ELISA as described in example 5. Human IgGl, IgG2, IgG4 and IgA were detected (BD Pharmingen) 1:1000 with sheep anti mouse IgG POX-<br>
coupled (Amersham Bioscience) 1:2000. A high anti-14VPl and 89VP1 IgGl titer of sera taken in autumn and winter could be detected (Fig. 9). The anti-rPhl p 1 IgGl antibody titer was much lower. IgG2, IgG4 and IgA antibodies could be detected in all cases at a very low level. The VPl proteins of the different HRV strains are closely related and cross-reactivity has been shown in other studies.<br>
Example  11:  Anti-  89VP1  and anti-rPhl p  1  antibodies  of Ph1 p  1  allergic patients<br>
Sera of five Ph1 p 1 allergic patients were taken and an ELISA experiment was performed as described in example 5. ELISA plates were coated with rPhl p 1 and 89VP1 and the specific IgM, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA and IgE antibody titer were determined (Fig. 10). More anti-8 9VPl IgGl antibodies than anti-rPhl p 1 IgGl antibodies could be detected.<br>
Example  12:  Detection  of anti-14VPl  antibody binding  to  the whole virus by Western blot  analysis<br>
The IgG antibody binding of sera of the 14VP1 injected rabbit to the whole virus was confirmed by using the whole HRV14 virus (lane 2 and 5) and 5 ug purified 14VP1 (lane 3 and 6) as control. The virus extract was separated by 12% SDS-Page and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit anti-14VPl antiserum (lane 1-3) 1:500 and preimmune serum (lane 4-6) 1:500 were tested for binding to HRV14 and 14VP1. Bound IgG was detected with 1251-labelled donkey anti-rabbit antibody and visualized by autoradiography (Fig.11).<br>
The binding of 14VPl-antiserum could be. detected at the same seize (33,6 kD) as 14VP1.<br>
Example 13: Anti-14VPl  antibodies neutralization of intact human  rhinovirus  14<br>
The tissue culture dosis 50 (TCD50) of HRV14 was determined. Therefore, a virus dilution from 1:10 -1:10 in MEM-Eagle 1% FCS and 40mM MgCl2 was performed and incubated in 24 well plates at 34°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere together with HeLa Ohio cells for three days. A control without the virus was also spread out.<br>
The cytotoxic effect of the virus was visualized with crystal violet after three days and the TCD50 (the dilution where 50% of the cells are dead) was calculated.<br>
Serum dilutions and virus (100TCD50) in row A and B were in-<br>
cubated at 34 °C. After 2 hours cells were spread out in all wells. D5 and D6 are serum controls. The experimental schema is shown in Fig. 12. The neutralization effect of the .antibodies was detected after three days with crystal violet (Fig. 12).<br>
Example  14:   Characteristics  of Ph1 p 5-derived synthetic peptides<br>
Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc-strategy with HBTU-activation (0.1 mmol small-scale cycles) on the Applied Biosys-tems peptide synthesizer Model 433A as described. (Focke et al. Faseb J (2001) 15:2042). After in-depth analysis of the Ph1 p 5 allergen six Ph1 p 5-derived peptides ranging from 31 (Pi: 302 6 Dalton) to 38 (P6: 3853 Dalton) amino acids in length which are rich in solvent-exposed amino acids were prepared (Table 3).<br>
These peptides have isoelectric points between 4.32 and 8.98 and three of them (peptide 3, 4 and 6) may contain human T-cell epitopes.<br>

Example  15:   Ph1 p 5-derived peptides  lack  IgE reactivity and allergenic activity<br>
15.1. Lack of IgE reactivity<br>
To analyze the IgE reactivity of the six Ph1 p 5-derived peptides, the isolated as well as KLH-coupled Ph1 p 5-derived peptides were compared with complete rPhl p 5 regarding IgE-binding capacity by ELISA using sera from 29 grass pollen allergic patients (Table 4).<br>
Table 4: Serological characterization of 2 9 grass pollen al- • lergic patients and a non-allergenic control. Sex, age, total serum IgE levels (kU/L), timothy extract-specific IgE (kUA/L), IgE antibodies specific for rPhl p 5 and the 6 isolated (P1-P6) and KLH-coupled (KLH-P1-KLH-P6) peptides were measured by ELISA and ODs (optical densities) are shown. Dashes indicate the lack of IgE reactivity to the isolated as well as to the KLH-coupled peptides.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp, Denmark) were coated with Ph1 p 5-derived peptides (5  µg/ml) or rPhl p 5 as control (5 µg/ml) , washed and blocked. Subsequently, plates were incubated with 1:3 diluted sera from 29 grass pollen allergic patients and from a non-atopic individual overnight at 4°C. Grass pollen allergic patients suffering from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma were selected according to case history indicative for seasonal grass pollinosis and characterized by skin prick testing with timothy pollen extract and serological CAP-FEIA (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) testing. Total IgE levels in the sera were determined by CAP measurements (Pharmacia). IgE<br>
antibodies specific for rPhl p 5 were determined by ELISA. Sera from 29 grass pollen allergic patients and a non-atopic individual were used for IgE competition studies. The grass pollen allergic patients group consisted of 13 males and 16 females with a mean age of 35 years (ranging from 25-51 years) (Table 4).<br>
Bound IgE antibodies were detected with a 1:1000 diluted al-kaline-phosphatase-coupled mouse monoclonal anti-human IgE antibody (Pharmingen, CA).<br>
Total IgE levels and grass pollen extract-specific IgE ranged from 24.9-2000 kU/L (mean: 262.7) and 2.2-100 kUA/L (mean: 41.5), respectively. All patients contained rPhl p 5-specific IgE antibodies ranging between 0.157-2.530 OD units (mean: 1.082 OD units), but none of the 29 patients showed IgE reactivity to any of the peptides (P1-P6) or to an equimolar mix of the peptides (OD ^ 0.08). This result demonstrates that no serum contained detectable IgE antibodies with specificity for any of the six Ph1 p 5 derived peptides.<br>
15.2. Reduced allergenic activity of the peptides as detected by CD 203 c expression on basophils: Basophil activation and flow cytometry:<br>
The upregulation of CD 203 c has been described as a surrogate marker for allergen-induced basophil activation and de-granulation (Hauswirth et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002; 110:102). Therefore, the allergenic activity of complete rPhl p 5 allergen and an equimolar mix of peptides by measuring CD 203 c upregulation on basophils of grass pollen allergic patients was compared.<br>
Peripheral blood cells were obtained from 3 allergic donors after informed consent had been given. Heparinized blood ali-quots (100 ul) were incubated with serial dilutions of recombinant allergens (10-4 to 10  µg/ml), anti-IgE antibody (1  µg/ml) or control buffer (phosphate-buffered saline = PBS) for 15 minutes at 37°C. After incubation, cells were washed in PBS containing 20 mM EDTA. Cells were then incubated with 10 ul of PE-conjugated CD203c mAb 97A6 for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT) . Thereafter, erythrocytes were lysed with 2 mL FACS™ Lysing Solution. Cells were then washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson), using Paint-a-Gate Software. Allergen-induced upregulation of CD203c was calculated from mean fluorescence intensities<br>
(MFIs) obtained with stimulated (MFIstim) and unstimulated (MFI-control) cells, and expressed as stimulation index (MFIstim : MFIcontrol). An SI of" &gt; 2.0 (&gt; 2-fold upregulation) was considered indicative of a specific response.<br>
As shown in Figure 14 it was found that complete rPhl p 5 shows a dose-dependent (10-4 to 10  µg/mL) increase in expression of CD203c on peripheral blood basophils in a sensitized individual, whereas an equimolar mix of the peptides shows no effect. Determination of CD 203c expression on basophils from grass-pollen allergic patients indicates that no allergenic activity can be observed with the Ph1 p 5 derived peptides.<br>

Purified recombinant Ph1 p 5 were expressed in E. coli as<br>
described (Vrtala et al. J of Immunol (1993) 151:4773-4781).<br>
Grass pollen from Phleum pratense, Lolium perenne, Poa prat-ensis, Dactylis glomerata, Secale cereale, Triticum aestivum, Avena sativa, Hordeum vulgare, Anthoxanthum odoratum were obtained from Allergon Pharmacia (Sweden), and an aqueous pollen extract was prepared as described (Vrtala et al., Int Arch Allergy Immunol (1993) 102:160-9.).<br>
16.2.	Immunization of rabbits<br>
HPLC-purified peptides were coupled to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin, MW 4.5x103- 1.3x107, Pierce, USA) according to the manufacturers advice and purified using a Conjugation Kit (Sigma, USA).<br>
Rabbits were immunized with each of the KLH conjugated-peptides (200  µg/injection) and, for control purposes, with complete rPhl p 5 using Freunds complete and incomplete adjuvant (Charles River). Serum samples were obtained in four week intervals .<br>
16.3.	Reactivity of rabbit antibodies with complete rPhl p 5<br>
and natural allergens from different grass species<br>
In order to investigate whether antibodies induced after immunization with KLH-coupled peptides recognize the rPhl p 5, natural Ph1 p 5 and Ph1 p 5-related grass pollen allergens from other grass pollen species, ELISA experiments were performed. For ELISA detection, plates (Nunc Maxisorp, Denmark) were coated<br>
with pollen allergen extracts (100  µg/ml: Phleum pratense, Lo-lium perenne, Poa pratensis Dactylis glomerata, Secale cereale, Triticum aestivum, Avena sativa, Hordeum vulgare, Anthoxanthum odoratum) or purified recombinant allergen (5  µg/ml: rPhl p 5). ELISA plates were washed and blocked and subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-peptide antisera and corresponding pre-immunsera diluted 1:2500. Bound rabbit IgG was detected with a HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit Ig antiserum (Jackson Immunre-search, Pennsylvania). Results represent means of duplicate determination with an error of

17.1. Inhibition of allergic patients' IgE-binding to rPhl p 5a by peptide-specific IgG<br>
Information regarding the capacity of the peptides to induce blocking antibodies is important since blocking antibodies were shown to play a major role in immunotherapy.<br>
In order to examine the ability of peptide-induced rabbit Ig to inhibit the binding of allergic patients' IgE to complete rPhl p 5 ELISA, competition experiments were performed using sera from 29 grass allergic patients.<br>
ELISA plates were coated with rPhl p 5 (1  µg/ml) and prein-cubated either with a 1:250 dilution of each of the anti-peptide antisera (anti-Pl-anti-P6), a mixture of the anti-peptide antisera, an anti-rPhl p 5 antiserum or for control purposes, with the corresponding preimmune sera or a mixture of the preimmune sera. After washing, the plates were incubated with 1:3 diluted sera from 29 grass pollen allergic patients and bound IgE antibodies were detected with the alkaline phosphatase-coupled mouse monoclonal anti-human IgE antibody (Pharmingen). The percentage inhibition of IgE-binding achieved by preincubation with the anti-peptide antisera was calculated as follows: %inhibition of IgE-binding = 100-ODI/ODpxl00. ODI and ODP represent the extinctions after preincubation with the rabbit's immune and preimmune serum, respectively. Preincubation of Ph1 p 5 with peptide-induced rabbit IgG inhibited allergic patients IgE reactivity to a varying degree. The average degree of inhibition of IgE binding ranged from 19.3% for anti-peptide 6 IgG to 28.5% with anti-peptide 1 IgG. Rabbit antibodies raised agains complete Ph1 p 5<br>
induced a mean inhibition of IgE binding of 43.6%.<br>
Table 6: Rabbit anti-Ph1 p 5 peptide antisera inhibit serum IgE-binding of timothy pollen allergic patients to Ph1 p 5. The percentage inhibition of IgE-binding to Ph1 p 5 is displayed for each patient after preincubation of Ph1 p 5 with anti-peptide antisera (anti-Pi - anti-P6), with a mix of the six anti-peptide antisera (anti-Pl-P6) or with an anti-rPhl p 5 antiserum. The mean percentage inhibition is' displayed in the bottom line. N.d.: not done. <br>

18.1. Lymphoproliferation assays<br>
In order to identify peptides with the lowest possible T-cell reactivity to minimize therapy-related side effects, the T-cell reactivity was examined by lymphoproliferation assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 2 grass pollen allergic patients by Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) density gradient centrifugation. PBMC (2x10 ) were cultured in triplicates in 96-well plates (Nunclone; Nalge Nunc International, Denmark) in 200 ul serum-free Ultra Culture medium (BioWhittaker, Rockland, ME) supplemented with 2 mM L-..glutamine (SIGMA, USA) , 50 uM beta-mercaptoethanol (SIGMA) and 0.1 mg gentamicin per ml (SIGMA) at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with different concentrations of synthetic peptides (1.25, 0.6 and 0.3 ug per well) and, for comparison, with 4 U Interleukin-2 per well (Boehringer<br>
Mannheim, Germany) and with medium alone. After 6 d culture 0.5<br>
3 uCi per well [ H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added<br>
and 16 h thereafter incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using a microbeta scintilllation counter (Wallac ADL, Germany). Mean cpm were calculated from the triplicates, and stimulation indices (SI) were calculated as the quotient of the cpm obtained by antigen or interleukin-2 stimulation and the unstimulated control.<br>
PBMCs from timothy pollen allergic patients were stimulated with different concentrations of synthetic peptides. Stimulation indices with peptides were significantly lower than with IL2. Ph1 p 5-derived peptides induced low specific lymphoprolifera-tive responses. The lowest response was seen with peptide 5 followed by peptide 4.<br>
Example 19:   Characteristics of Fel  d 1-derived synthetic peptides<br>
In order to obtain peptides suitable for cat allergy vaccination, five peptides which are 30 to 36 amino acids long and cover the whole molecule were designed according to the known amino acid sequence of Fel d 1.<br>
Peptides were synthesized using a Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-strategy with HBTU (2-(lH-benzotriazol-1-yl) 1,1,3,3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophos-phate) -activation (0.1 mmol small-scale cycles) on the Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer Model 433A (USA). Preloaded PEG-<br>
PS (polyethylenglycol polystyrene) resins (0.15-0.2 mmol/g loading) (PerSeptive Biosystems, UK) were used as solid phase to build up the peptides. -Chemicals were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Coupling of amino acids was confirmed by conductivity monitoring in a feedback control system. One cystein residue was added to peptides 1, 3, 4, and 5 to facilitate coupling to carriers (Table 7). Peptides were cleaved from the resins with a mixture of 250 ul destilled water, 250 ul tfiisopropylsilan<br>
(Fluka, Switzerland), 9.5 ml TFA for 2h and precipitated in tert-butylmethylether (Fluka, Switzerland) (Focke 2001) . The identity of the peptides was checked by mass-spectrometry and peptides were purified to &gt;90% purity by preparative HPLC<br>
(PiChem, Austria).<br>
Table 7: Molecular characteristics of Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides. Position within the native Fel d 1 molecule,-amino acid sequence, number of amino acids, calculated molecular weight (MW) and theoretical isoelectric point (pi) of the Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides are shown. All peptides are soluble in water.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
The five Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides have molecular weights in the range, of 3246 to 4083 Dalton and have calculated isoelectric points of from 4.30 to 4.93. All five peptides are watersoluble and Peptides 1, 2 and 3 may contain human T-cell epitopes (Table 7).<br>

(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
Example 20:   Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides have reduced IgE reactivity compared  to rFel d 1  and Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides  lack allergenic activity<br>
Serum IgE reactivity to the Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides in order to identify hypoallergenic peptides suited for vaccination was investigated.<br>
The diagnosis of IgE-mediated cat allergy was based on anamnesis, skin prick testing (Allergopharma, Reinbek, Germany) and measurement of total serum IgE as well as of cat dander-specific serum IgE (CAP-FEIA, Pharmacia Diagnostics, Sweden). Non-allergic persons were included for control purposes.<br>
20.1. IgE-binding capacity measured in ELISA assays<br>
The IgE-binding capacity of the five Fel d 1-derived syn-<br>
thetic peptides was compared with that of the complete rFel d 1 allergen using sera from 14 cat allergic patients. ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorb, Denmark) were coated with Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides or rFel d 1 as control (0.5  µg/well), washed and blocked. Plates were then incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:5 diluted sera from cat allergic patients and from a non-atopic individual. Bound IgE antibodies were detected with a 1:2500 diluted horse-raddish-peroxidase labeled anti-human IgE antibody (KPL, USA).<br>
Sera from 7 female and 7 male cat allergic patients at the age of 22 to 75 years were subjected to CAP-FEIA determinations. Measured total IgE levels ranged from 122 to &gt;4000 kU/1 and cat dander specific IgE levels from 1.99 to &gt;100 kUA/1 (Table 7). In ELISA assays the IgE reactivity of all 14 tested sera to the major cat allergen Fel d 1 was confirmed. Results were obtained as optical densities (OD) and ranged from 0.178 to 2.838 OD units. IgE reactivity of the 14 sera to Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides was measured in the same ELISA assay. It was found that IgE-binding was retained for Peptides 1, 2, 3, and 5. IgE-binding was observed for 6/14 sera to Peptide 1, for 3/14 sera to Peptide 2, for 1/14 sera to Peptide 3 and for 10/14 sera to Peptide 5. Measured OD units were between 0.051 and 1.998 for Peptide 1, between 0.060 and 0.123 for Peptide 2, 0.186 for Peptide 3 and between 0.056 and 0.677 for Peptide 5. In summary, all measured OD units were considerably lower than the respective values measured for the whole Fel d 1 allergen.<br>
This demonstrates that Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides ■ have a reduced IgE reactivity compared to the whole Fel d 1 allergen. Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides can therefore be considered hypoallergenic, providing the advantage of reduced IgE-mediated side-effects, when used in SIT.<br>
20.2. Specific induction of expression of surface markers CD203c and CD63 on human basophils (Fig. 17)<br>
Since IgE-binding is a prerequisite but not ample for induction of type 1 allergic reactions that also require cross-link of effector cell bound specific IgE, the actual allergenic activity of Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides was investigated in basophil activation assays. These assays detect an allergen-specific upregulation of surface markers CD203c and CD63, both recognized as markers for basopil activation (Hauswirth et al. J<br>
Allergy Clin Immunol. (2002) 110:102-109).<br>
Heparinized blood samples were taken from 5 cat-allergic patients after informed consent had been given. Blood aliquots (100 µl) were incubated with serial dilutions of rFel d 1, Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides as single components or as equimolar mixture, anti-IgE antibody or buffer (PBS) for 15 minutes at 37°C. After incubation, cells were washed in PBS containing 20 mM EDTA. Cells were then incubated with 10 ul of PE-conjugated CD203c mAb 97A6 and 20 ul of FITC-conjugated CD63 mAb CLB-granl2 for 15 minutes at room temperature. Thereafter, the samples were subjected to erythrocyte lysis with 2 ml FACS™ Lysing Solution. Cells were then washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, USA), using Paint-a-Gate Software. Allergen-induced upregulation of CD203c and CD63 was calculated from mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) obtained with stimulated (MFIstim) and unstimulated (MFIcontrol) cells, and expressed as stimulation index (MFIstim : MFIcontrol). An SI of .more than 2.0 (i.e. more than 2-fold upregulation) was considered indicative of a specific (diagnostic) response.<br>
On basophils of all five studied cat-allergic patients (RR, EB, KC, MG and SM) stimulation with rFel d 1 induced an allergen-specific upregulation of surface markers CD203c and CD63. The upregulation of CD2 03c and CD63 was observed to be dose-dependent for 4/5 patients (RR, KC, MG and SM). For these patients CD203c stimulation indices ranged from 1.1 (SM) to 3.2 (RR) for the lowest tested concentration of 0.001 ug rFel d 1/ml and from 3.6 (KC) to 6.2 (RR) for the highest tested concentration of 10 ug rFel d 1/ml. CD63 stimulation indices determined in the same assay ranged from 1.1 (RR) to 2.0 (MG) for the lowest tested rFel d 1 concentration of 0.001  µg/ml and from 3.9 (RR) to 7.3 (MG) for the highest tested rFel d 1 concentration of 10  µg/ml.<br>
For Patient EB 0.001  µg/ml Fel d 1 were already sufficient to induce a high-level upregulation of surface markers CD203c and CD63 preventing an observation of dose-dependency of the surface marker upregulation.<br>
Basophils from all five cat-allergic patients were probed with five increasing concentrations (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50  µg/ml) of an equimolar mix of the five Fel d 1-derived synthetic<br>
peptides. Basophils from patient RR were additionally probed with five increasing concentrations of the five single Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10  µg/ml) . Peptides were found to be deficient in upregulating the basophil surface markers CD203c and CD63. Peptides were unable to induce any increased expression of CD203c and CD63 on cells of patient RR, KC and SM. A slight upregulation of CD203c (SI=2.3) and of CD63 (SI=2.5) could be detected for patient MG but only for the highest tested concentration of 50 ug peptide mixture/ml, while the lower concentrations applied had also no stimulating effect. A more pronounced upregulation of CD203c (SI=4.2) and CD63 (SI=4.3) was observed for patient EB but, again, only for the highest tested peptide mixture concentration. In both cases, patient MG and EB, the rate of upregulation after stimulation with peptides was considerably lower than the corresponding values for stimulation with the whole Fel d 1 allergen.<br>
This demonstrates that Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides provide the advantage of holding a lower allergenic activity than the whole Fel d 1 allergen. This is relevant for a decreased risk of IgE-mediated side-effects when Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides are used in SIT.<br>
Example  21:   Immunization  with  Fel  d 1-derived synthetic peptides   induces   IgG antibodies  reactive  with   the whole  rFel  d 1 allergen<br>
Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides were shown to be deficient in IgE-binding. As candidate molecules for vaccination, which aims at the induction of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, peptides must retain specific allergen structures and must still be able to induce an IgG immune response specific for the whole allergen. In order to find out whether Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides fulfill these requirements, immunization experiments in rabbits were performed.<br>
Rabbits were immunized with uncoupled rFel d 1 and KLH-coupled Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides. HPLC-purified peptides were coupled to KLH via their cysteine residues, using an Imject Maleimide Activated Immunogen Conjugation Kit (Pierce, USA) .<br>
Rabbits (New Zealand White rabbits) were immunized with the immunogens (200  µg/injection) using CFA (first immunization) and IFA (first booster injection after 4 weeks; a second booster in-<br>
jection with incomplete adjuvant was given after 7 weeks) (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Germany). Rabbits were bled 8 weeks after the first immunization and in four-week intervals thereafter.<br>
The induction of peptide- and rFel d 1-specific antibodies was monitored in ELISA assays. ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorb, Denmark) were coated with rFel d 1 (0.5  µg/well), washed and blocked. Plate-bound rFel d 1 was then probed in duplicates with 1:1000 diluted rabbit antisera and the corresponding rabbit pre-immune sera, and bound IgG was detected with an 1:2000 diluted hoseraddish-peroxidase labelled goat anti-rabbit antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., USA). Means of duplicates were calculated and showed errors of less than 5%.<br>
Immunization with Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides induces Fel d 1 reactive IgG antibodies. Eight weeks after the first immunization with each of the five Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides, IgG antibodies reactive to the whole Fel d 1 allergen could be detected in each of the five rabbit antisera. IgG antibody levels remained at comparable levels in the subsequent bleedings (Fig. 16).<br>
Anti-Peptide 1, anti-Peptide 2, anti-Peptide 4 and anti-Peptide 5 rabbit antisera showed IgG reactivities to Fel d 1 at about the same magnitude than the anti-Fel d 1 rabbit antiserum. Also the anti-Peptide 3 rabbit antiserum showed a distinct but a somewhat lower IgG reactivity to Fel d 1.<br>
This indicates that all 5 Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides are candidate molecules to induce an Fel d 1 specific IgG antibody response.<br>
Example 22:   Fel  d 1-derived synthetic peptides  induce  weaker lymphoproliferative responses   than Fel  d 1<br>
Desired candidate molecules for improved SIT do not only offer the advantage of reduced IgE-mediated side effects but also of reduced T-cell mediated side effects. In order to investigate the T-cell activating properties of Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides, lymphoproliferative assays were performed.<br>
PBMCs were isolated from 7 cat-allergic patients by Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) densitiy gradient centrifuga-tion. PBMC (2 x 10 ) were cultured in triplicates in 96-well plates (Nunclone, Nalgene Nunc International, Denmark) in 200 ul serum-free Ultra Culture medium (Cambrex, Belgium) supplemented<br>
with 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma, USA), 50 uM 3-mercaptoethanol<br>
(Sigma) and 0.1 mg gentamicin per ml (Sigma) at 37 °C using 5% CO2<br>
in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were stimulated with different<br>
concentrations (5, 2.5, 1.25 and 0.6  µg/well) of rFel d 1 and<br>
Fe d 1-derived sythetic peptides as single components or as<br>
equimolar mixture and, for control purposes, with 4U  inter-<br>
leukin-2 or with medium alone. After 6 days of culture, 0.5 uCi<br>
3 per well H-thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and<br>
16 h thereafter, incorporated'radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using a microbeta scintillation counter (Wallac ADL, Germany), and mean cpm were calculated from the triplicates. The stimulation index (SI) was calculated as the quotient of the cpm obtained by antigen or interleukin-2 stimulation and the unstimulated medium control.<br>
IL-2 stimulated proliferation of PBMC from all 7 tested cat-allergic patients, resulting in stimulation indices of 9.8 for RR, 5.2 for EB, 3.2 for KC, 6.7 for MG, 6.3 for SM, 15.7 for RA and of 13.9 for AR.<br>
Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides induced lower stimulation indices (Table 9).<br>
Table 9: Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides which on an equimolar basis induce weaker lymphoproliferative responses than . Fel d 1 can be identified.

Specific lymphoproliferative responses are shown as stimulation indices.<br>

Example 23:   IgG antibodies  induced by immunization  with<br>
Fel  d 1-derived synthetic peptides  inhibit binding of cat-allergic patients   IgE to  the  whole Fel  d 1  allergen<br>
The ability of peptide-induced rabbit Ig to inhibit the binding of allergic patients' IgE antibodies to complete rFel d 1 was examined in ELISA competition assays. ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorb, Denmark) were coated with rFel d 1 (0.05  µg/well), washed and blocked. Plate-bound rFel d 1 was then pre-incubated with 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-peptide antisera (single anti-peptide antisera as "well as a mixture of anti-peptide antisera were used), rabbit anti-rFel d 1 antiserum, and for control purposes also with the respective rabbit preimmune sera. After the plates had been washed, they were incubated with 1:5 diluted human sera from cat-allergic patients. Bound IgE antibodies were detected with a 1:2500 diluted horse-raddish-peroxidase labeled anti-human IgE antibody (KPL, USA). The percentage inhibition of IgE-binding achieved by preincubation with the anti-peptide antisera was calculated as follows: %inhibition of IgE-binding = 100 - O.D.j / O.D.p x 100, with O.D.j being the measured optical densitiy after preincubation with rabbit immune sera and O.D.p with rabbit preimmune sera.<br>
Preincubation of ELISA-plate bound Fel d 1 with the 5 anti-peptide rabbit antisera resulted in inhibition patterns that varied between the 14 different tested sera from cat-allergic patients. Anti-Peptide 1 rabbit antiserum blocked patients' IgE-binding to Fel d 1 for 13/14 tested patients' sera, anti-Peptide 2 rabbit antiserum for 8/14, anti-Peptide 3 rabbit antiserum for 13/14, anti-Peptide 4 rabbit antiserum for 9/14 and anti-Peptide 5 rabbit antiserum for 5/14.<br>
Also the range of inhibition showed variations between the different antisera. Among the single tested anti-peptide rabbit antisera, anti-Peptide 1 rabbit antiserum showed best inhibition rates with inhibitions from 0-55% (average 29%). With anti-Peptide 2 rabbit antiserum inhibition rates of 0-18% (average 5%) could be achieved, with anti-Peptide 3 rabbit antiserum of 0-29% (average 11%), with anti-Peptide 4 rabbit antiserum of 0-24% (average 8%) and with anti-Peptide 5 rabbit antiserum of 0-18% (average 4%) .<br>
A mix of all 5 anti-peptide rabbit antisera inhibited patients' IgE-binding to Fel d 1 most efficiently with inhibitions achieved for all patients' sera and inhibition rates of 25-84%<br>
(average 59%). These inhibitions were even more pronounced than that achieved by preincubation with the anti-Fel d 1 rabbit antiserum (Table 10) .<br>
Table 10: Rabbit antisera raised against Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides inhibit binding of human IgE to Fel d 1. The percentage inhibition of IgE-binding to Fel d 1 achieved by preincubation of Fel d 1 with rabbit antisera are shown for 14 patients and as means. Preincubations were performed with 5 rabbit antisera raised against the 5'; Fel d 1-derived synthetic peptides<br>
(anti-Peptide 1-5), a mix of the 5 anti-peptide antisera (Mix) and an antiserum raised against Fel d 1 (anti-rFel d 1) .<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
When the anti-Peptide 1 rabbit antiserum was combined with each of the other anti-peptide antisera, the inhibition of allergic patients IgE binding was substantially increased reaching almost values (e.g. anti-peptide 1+4:41%, anti-peptide 1+5:42%)<br>
obtained with anti-rFel d 1 antibodies (67%) (Table 11).<br>

Example 24:  Bet v 1-derived peptides induce Bet  v 1-specific IgG responses  receiving T~cell help from carrier-derived T-cell epitopes and reduce Bet  v 1-specific T-cell proliferation.<br>
Bet v 1-derived, surface-exposed B cell peptides have already been shown to induce a protective Bet v 1-specific IgG response in a mouse model of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccination (Focke M et al. Clin Exp Allergy (2004) 34:1525-1533). In Focke M et al. (2004), 6 Bet v 1-derived peptides were coupled to the carrier molecule KLH before immunization of mice. In the present example it is shown that the Bet v 1-specific IgG response induced with these peptides (Table 1) is driven by the help of T-cell epitopes derived from the carrier but not from the Bet v 1 allergen. It was surprisingly found that none of the Bet v 1-derived peptides having.the sequences LFPKVAPQAISS-VENIEGNGGPGTIKKISF (SEQ ID No. 20), GPGTIK-KISFPEGFPFKYVKDRVDEVDHTN (SEQ ID No. 21) and VDHTNFKYNYSVIEGG-<br>
PIGDTLEKISNEIK (SEQ ID No. 22) induced relevant T-cell responses, and it could be demonstrated that the majority of T-cell responses was directed against the carrier molecule, KLH (Figs. 18 and 19). This finding is of great importance for the reduction of side effects during therapeutic vaccination and for reducing the risk of a potential sensitization during prophylactic vaccination. It has been demonstrated in the past that allergen-derived peptides lacking any IgE reactivity but containing allergen-derived T-cell epitopes induced side effects due to T-cell activation. Allergen-derived peptides lacking IgE and T-cell reactivity as exemplified for the .Bet v 1 peptides, induce neither IgE nor T-cell mediated side-effects during therapeutic vaccination. When used for prophylactic vaccination, the peptides will induce a Bet v 1-specific protective IgG response without priming of Bet v 1-specific T-cells. This should minimize the risk of pre-priming an allergic immune response through the vaccine which might pave the road for a subsequent allergic sensitization.<br>
In this example the allergen- and carrier-specific T-cell responses in a mouse model of therapeutic and prophylactic allergen vaccination were dissected. Bet v 1-derived peptides 2,3, and 6 (Focke M et al. (2004)) were chosen and tested on whether they contain any of the known Bet v 1-specific T-cell epitopes in BALB/c mice. The mice were immunized as follows (Table 10 shows the sensitization and treatment protocol): Groups of BALB/c mice (n=5) were immunized with 10 ug recombinant Bet v 1 (Biomay, Austria) and/or a mixture of the synthetic Bet v 1-derived peptides 2, 3, and 6 (10 ug of each). Peptides were coupled to KLH as previously described (Focke M et al. (2004)). For immunization, Bet v 1 and the peptide mix were adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide (Alu-Gel-S, Serva, Germany) in a total volume of 150 ul/mouse.<br>
Table 12: Sensitization and treatment protocol.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
Allergen-, peptide-, and carrier-specific lymphoprolifera-tion was analyzed in a T-cell proliferation assay. Spleens were removed under sterile conditions and homogenized. After lysis of erythrocytes, cells were washed and resuspended in complete medium (RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, 2 mM glutamine). Single cell suspensions were plated into 96-well round-bottom plates at a concentration of 2 x 105 cells/well and stimulated with concavalin A (0.5 pg/well) as a positive control, rBet v 1 (2  µg/well), KLH (2  µg/well), the peptide mix (0.34 ug of each peptide/well) or the medium alone for 4 days. The cultures were pulsed with 0.5 pCi/well tritiated thymidine for 16 h and harvested. The proliferation responses were measured by scintillation counting. The ratio of the mean proliferation after antigen stimulation and medium control values, i.e. the stimulation index (SI), was calculated.<br>
Interestingly, it could be shown that therapeutic vaccination with Bet v 1-derived peptides could reduce Bet v 1-specific proliferation in Bet v 1 sensitized mice (group S+/T+) compared to the sensitized but untreated group S+/T-. In the sensitized and treated group no peptide-specific proliferation could be measured, but according to the carrier effect, a KLH-specific proliferation was observed. The peptide vaccine alone (group S-/T+) induced mainly KLH-specific T-cells, but almost no Bet v 1-specific T-cell response (Figure 18).<br>
Prophylactic vaccination with the peptides induced almost no<br>
Bet v 1-specific proliferation (group P+/S-) compared to the Bet v 1-sensitized group P-/S+ but KLH-specific proliferation. In prophylactically vaccinated and subsequently sensitized mice (group P+/S+) Bet v 1 specific proliferation was remarkably reduced, furthermore, no peptide-specific response could be observed in any mouse group (Figure 19).<br>
Thus, it could be shown in an allergy mouse model that prophylactic vaccination with carrier-bound allergen-derived B cell peptides did not prime peptide-specific T-cells, almost no allergen-specific but carrier-specific T-cells. Prophylactic vaccination preceding allergic sensitization but also therapeutic vaccination of sensitized mice reduces allergen-specific T-cell proliferation.<br>
Prophylactic treatment with Bet v 1-derived peptides induced Bet v 1-specific IgG responses without help by Bet v 1-specific T-cells. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment increased Bet v 1-specific IgG responses induced by the Bet v 1 allergen already 20 and 40 days after first sensitization (Figure 20).<br>
These results demonstrate that the peptide vaccine induces a Bet v 1-specific IgG response which can be boosted by allergen exposure.<br>
Example 25: Per p 2-derived peptides showing reduced IgE binding capacity<br>
The IgE binding capacity of Der p 2-derived peptides was determined as described in examples 15.1 and 20.1 employing the peptides according to table 13 and using sera of individuals suffering from house dust mite allergy.<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
The results clearly show that the Der p 2 derived peptides<br>
of the present invention exhibit significantly reduced IgE binding capacity.<br>

26.1. Design of peptides<br>
To study the effect of variation in peptides length on IgE-binding capacity, T-cell reactivity and immunogenicity variants of Ph1 p 5 derived peptides were designed by increasing the length of peptide 1 (PI) and decreasing the length of peptide 2 (P2) by a few amino-acids (Table 15).<br>

26.2. Lack of IgE-reactivity<br>
To analyse the IgE-reactivity of Ph1 p 5 derived peptides 1, 2 and their variants la, 2b dot-blot assays were performed applying 0.2ng peptide/dot and using sera from 7 grass-pollen allergic patients (pl-p7) and the serum from a non-atopic individual (NHS). Bound IgE was detected with 125 I- labelled anti-human IgE (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden). rPhl p 5 was used as positive control and HSA as negative control. Patients react with<br>

rPhl p 5 but not with the peptides and peptide variants (Fig. 21) .<br>
26.3.	Lymphoproliferative responses<br>
PBMCs from 2 grass pollen allergic patients were stimulated with different concentrations of Ph1 p 5 derived peptides 1, 2, their variants la, 2b and for control purposes with rPhl p 5. Stimulation indices obtained with the peptides were significantly lower than those obtained with rPhl p 5 (Fig. 22).<br>
26.4.	Immunogenicity of peptide variants<br>
Rabbits were immunized with KLH-coupled Ph1 p 5 derived peptides and variants. ELISA experiments were used to measure IgG reactivity of the obtained rabbit antisera to peptides and their variants (Table 16). Immunization with peptides and their variants induced cross-reactive IgG antibodies recognizing the peptide and the corresponding variant.<br>

26.5. Peptide induced rabbit antisera inhibit grass pollen allergic patients' IgE binding to rPhl p 5<br>
The ability of rabbit anti-peptide 2 and 2b IgGs to inhibit human IgE binding to rPhl p 5 was studied in competition ELISAs. .ELISA plate bound rPhl p 5 was preincubated with anti P2, anti P2b and, for control purposes, with anti Ph1 p 5 antisera. Plates were then exposed to sera from 12 grass pollen allergic patients. The percentage of inhibition of IgE-binding to rPhl p 5 is displayed in Table 17. Anti peptide 2 and anti peptide 2b antisera inhibit patients' IgE binding to rPhl p 5 to the same extent.<br>
Competition ELISAs were also performed with rabbit anti peptide 1 and la antisera. In example 17 (Immunization with Ph1 p 5 derived peptides induces IgG antibodies which inhibit the binding of grass pollen allergic patients IgE to Ph1 p 5) the anti peptide 1 (Pi) antibodies inhibited patients IgE binding to Ph1 p 5 with a mean inhibition rate of 28.5%. Similar results were obtained with anti peptide la antiserum which gave an inhibition rate of 23.7%.<br>

Example  27:   Cross-protection  of anti-VPl  antibodies<br>
Human rhinoviruses comprise over hundred different strains. In this neutralization test it is shown that the rhinovirus infection of one strain can also be inhibited by VP1 specific antibodies of another strain. HeLa cells were seeded out in the wells at equal density. 100TCD50 HRV14 was preincubated with dilutions of anti-14VPl- and anti-8 9VPl antibodies (undiluted; 1:2-1:32 wells 1-6) and added to the wells in lane A and D, respectively. In lanes B and C 100TCD50 HRV 89 preincubated with dilutions of anti-14VPl- and anti-89VPl antibodies, respectively, were added to the cells. After 3 days live cells were stained violet. Anti-89VP1 antibodies and anti-14VPl antibodies block the infection of HRV14 in a comparable manner. The antibodies raised against 14VP1 and 89VP1 also inhibit the infection of HRV89 up to the same concentration.<br>
