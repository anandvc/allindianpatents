Description:<br>
The present invention relates to a container for the intake<br>
of a medicament and the release thereof into an<br>
administration device, to the production and use of said <br>
container, and also to the associated administration<br>
device. The medicaments are, for example, medicaments to<br>
be administered parenterally, but they may also be oral or<br>
topical medicaments. The container according to the<br>
invention exhibits a particularly advantageous<br>
configuration of the casing.<br>
In the case of parenteral administration - i.e.<br>
administration by-passing the gut of a mammal - of<br>
medicaments, this generally takes place by injection or<br>
infusion. The term 'injection' is understood to mean the<br>
administration of a liquid sterile medicament by means of a<br>
syringe and a hollow needle directly into the tissue or<br>
vascular system, by-passing the gastro-intestinal tract.<br>
In the case of infusion, it is a question of slow, mostly<br>
dropwise influx of relatively large quantities of (drug-<br>
containing) liquid into the body.<br>
Medicaments - for example, medicaments to be administered<br>
parenterally - are generally decanted, after their<br>
preparation, into a container that is able to receive one<br>
or more portions/doses. This container is designated as<br>
the primary packing.<br><br>
By way of primary packing, glass ampoules are known that<br>
have to be opened with a special ampoule saw or that are<br>
furnished with a predetermined breaking-point for the<br>
purpose of opening. The contents have to be transferred<br>
from the ampoule into a container that is suitable for the<br>
administration, such as a syringe, for example.<br>
Furthermore, for the most part, residual liquid has to<br>
remain in the ampoule, since otherwise the aspiration of<br>
air may occur disadvantageously in the course of filling<br>
the syringe. Moreover, a later sealing of the ampoule,<br>
with the residual liquid contained therein, is practically<br>
impossible.<br>
A so-called pierceable ampoule (vial) is known from the<br>
state of the art as a further container. Said ampoule is<br>
punctured with a syringe at a point provided for this<br>
purpose, and the syringe is then filled with the liquid<br>
held in the container. This process associated with this<br>
container is very elaborate, since the ampoule cannot be<br>
used immediately for the purpose of administration, but the<br>
contents rather have to be transferred out of the ampoule<br>
into a container that is suitable for the administration,<br>
such as the aforementioned syringe. The opening or<br>
piercing of ampoules, and a subsequent necessary transfer<br>
into a container that is suitable for the administration,<br>
proves to be disadvantageous, for example in emergency<br>
situations in which administration has to be effected under-<br>
time-pressure .<br>
Nowadays, decanting is also effected directly into a<br>
syringe that is furnished with a clipped-on or glued-in<br>
cannula for the purpose of administration. By virtue of<br>
pressure on the plunger which is movably supported in the<br><br>
syringe container, the liquid is injected, out of the<br>
container through the cannula into the place of<br>
administration. The syringe has the disadvantage that, by<br>
reason of the multi-part structure, it is comparatively<br>
expensive. For the purpose of maintaining operational<br>
capability also after a relatively long period of storage,<br>
the plunger and the syringe container are furnished with<br>
coatings, for example with silicone. Hence a substance is<br>
stored and administered together with the medicament that<br>
has nothing to do with the actual action of the medicament<br>
and that may even have a disadvantageous effect, for<br>
example in the case of medicaments having a high pH value.<br>
Together with the parenteral medicaments - which in general<br>
are decanted into ampoules, vials or ready-to-use syringes,<br>
and also into infusion bottles or infusion bags - non-<br>
parenterally administered medicaments are sometimes also<br>
stored in ampoules or vials, since, for example, they have<br>
to be mixed with water prior to administration.<br>
From US 4,926,915 a container is known in the form of a<br>
collapsible tube. The collapsible tube disclosed therein<br>
represents a simplification of the ampoule or pierceable<br>
ampoule, since a syringe can be directly attached and<br>
filled. By way of means for connection to a collapsible<br>
tube, a surface is proposed tapering conically inwards to a<br>
point.<br>
GB 8 00 455 A discloses the connection of two collapsible<br>
tubes so as to result in a reciprocal ejection of contents.<br>
Connection to an administration device is not provided.<br>
US 4,926,915 A discloses, inter alia, a collapsible-tube-<br>
shaped container with a Luer coupling for connection to an<br><br>
ampoule. Connection to an administration device is<br>
likewise not provided.<br>
In.US 2003/00107 95 A1 a container is shown that is<br>
configured in such a way that a triggered release of a<br>
liquid is continued independently.<br>
US 4,328,912 describes a collapsible container that is<br>
capable of implementing a release of a liquid independently<br>
by reason of a specific design of a valve.<br>
US 2003/0015605 Al describes a container filled with a<br>
liquid, wherein under the influence of pressure a discharge<br>
is triggered abruptly only after an initial resistance has<br>
been overcome.<br>
Against the background of the disadvantages described<br>
above, it is therefore the object of the present invention<br>
to make available a container for the intake and release of<br>
a medicament or, to be more exact, a container with an<br>
associated administration device that each facilitate the<br>
administration of a medicament and also the connection to<br>
an administration device and that are of comparatively<br>
simple construction.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the container claimed<br>
in Claim 1. Advantageous configurations will become<br>
apparent from the dependent claims. An advantageous<br>
production process and also an advantageous use are<br>
subjects of the associated independent claims.<br>
The container according to the invention for receiving and<br>
releasing a medicament is furnished with an integral casing<br>
which is sealed, except for an opening for the purpose of:<br><br>
releasing the medicament. The container is furthermore<br>
configured in such a way that a release of the medicament<br>
from the opening is effected by alteration of the whole<br>
casing or of a region of the casing. The medicament is<br>
present, for example, in a solution or other liquid, the<br>
viscosity of which may have been chosen to be variable.<br>
For example, it is a question of a medicament to be<br>
administered parenterally, orally or topically.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the alteration of the<br>
casing is associated with the release of the medicament.<br>
For example, by reason of the choice of material and, in<br>
particular, in the case of' a comparatively large-volume<br>
casing the casing is configured to be collapsing; this<br>
means that at the time of release of the medicament by<br>
means of capillary forces and/or by reason of the effect of<br>
gravity the at. least partial collapse of the casing, and<br>
consequently alteration of the casing, occurs by reason of<br>
the partial vacuum forming in the container.<br>
The concept of 'integrality' is to be understood in such a<br>
way that the casing is not of multi-part construction. The<br>
casing is, for example, made of one material or several<br>
materials and/or exhibits differing compositions in various<br>
regions. In comparison with a multi-part structure, as in<br>
the case of a plunger device, the integrality of the casing<br>
ensures an inexpensive production of the device.<br>
Furthermore, administration is effected in a mariner that is<br>
particularly simple, sterile, rapid and not susceptible to<br>
faults. By reason of the integrality, the number of<br>
product-contacting elements or materials is reduced, for<br>
example in comparison with a structural design having a<br>
moving plunger, so that the compatibility with the<br><br>
medicament can be ensured advantageously and comparatively<br>
simply.<br>
The container according to the invention further includes a<br>
hollow needle in the region of the opening. In one<br>
embodiment, the hollow needle serves as means for<br>
connection to an administration device or to a container<br>
for a medicinal liquid. By means of the hollow needle the<br>
connection can be made quickly and securely. In the case<br>
of the administration devices to which a liquid-conducting<br>
connection is to be established by means of the needle, it<br>
is a question of means for infusion or injection that, for<br>
example, exhibit a membrane or foil which is penetrated by<br>
the hollow needle for the purpose of emptying the container<br>
into the administration device.<br>
In an advantageous configuration of the device according to<br>
the invention, it is a question of an administration device<br>
- that is to say, an infusion or injection needle or<br>
cannula - that serves for administering the medicament to a<br>
patient via the opening. If the container that is used for<br>
transport and storage is used, at the same time for the<br>
purpose of administering the medicament, a process of<br>
transfer from a transport container into a container that<br>
is intended for the administration is advantageously<br>
dispensed with.<br>
In one configuration, the hollow needle serves for direct<br>
administration, for example by injection. Injection is<br>
effected - depending on the place of administration <br>
intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,<br>
intravenously, intra-arterially, intracardially, intra-<br>
articularly, intrathecally or intralumbarly. In one<br>
embodiment, the hollow needle is manufactured from metal -<br><br>
for example, medical special steel - and is sharpened, in<br>
order to be employed as an injection or infusion needle in<br>
humans or animals.<br>
According to one embodiment, the hollow needle is inserted<br>
or glued into the casing in the region of the opening.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment, the casing is<br>
formed integrally with the hollow needle. By virtue of<br>
this, the container can be produced particularly<br>
inexpensively. As a result, in advantageous manner no<br>
further material comes into contact with the medicament in<br>
the course of release of the medicament. During storage<br>
and release, contact with the medicament is limited to one<br>
material or one material composition. In this way it can<br>
be ensured particularly simply that contact with materials<br>
of the container does not have a disadvantageous effect -<br>
for example, altering the pH value - on the medicament<br>
contained in the container. Furthermore, in this way the<br>
container can be produced particularly simply, cost-<br>
effectively and rapidly, which is an advantage from the<br>
point of view of production technology.<br>
In another advantageous configuration of the container<br>
according to the invention, said container is configured in<br>
such a way that the release of the medicament is achieved<br>
or at least triggered by pressure on at least one outer<br>
region of the casing. For example, the casing is designed<br>
in such a manner that a release of the medicament is<br>
brought about by pressure of the thumb on the associated<br>
outer region of the casing. As a result, a particularly<br>
reproducible, dosed release of the medicament - which, for<br>
example, is present in liquid form with highly varying<br>
viscosity - is made possible. For example, the injection<br><br>
pressure required for an injection is generated by the<br>
pressure acting on the casing; additional means for<br>
generating pressure - for example, a pump - can<br>
consequently be dispensed with advantageously. For<br>
example, the container is of tubular construction. A<br>
pressure on the tubular casing triggers a reduction in<br>
volume. The associated reduction in volume brings about a<br>
displacement out of the container of the medicament<br>
received in the container, and hence an escape and hence a<br>
release via the opening. Depending on the chosen hardness<br>
of the casing, the characteristic of the pressure to be<br>
applied can be advantageously varied.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment, the container is<br>
configured in such a way that after the triggering of the<br>
release by virtue of the pressure the release of the<br>
medicament is continued independently. For example, this<br>
is achieved by means of a configuration in which, when a<br>
certain outer curvature is. attained, a relatively hard and<br>
elastic casing segment jumps in spring-like manner - in<br>
accordance with the jumping-jack principle - into the<br>
opposite curvature, pointing into the interior of the<br>
container, and in this way releases a precisely defined<br>
volume of medicament by reason of the spring characteristic<br>
of the casing segment. By virtue of this, on the one hand<br>
an independent release is achieved, and on the other hand a<br>
well-dosed release.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment, the container<br>
exhibits a collapsible-tube-shaped casing. "Collapsible-<br>
tube-shaped" in the sense of the invention is to be<br>
understood in such a way that, substantially as a<br>
consequence of the heat sealing, the container tapers to a<br>
point at its end located opposite the opening. By virtue<br><br>
of this type of configuration, a particularly easy emptying<br>
of the container - and hence release of the medicament - is<br>
achieved. For example, by means of a stroking movement<br>
from the pointed end of the collapsible tube a particularly<br>
effective - i.e. rapid and largely remainder-free -<br>
emptying of the container can be achieved, particularly if<br>
the medicament exhibits a high viscosity in comparison with<br>
aqueous solutions. A collapsible tube is generated, for<br>
example, by means of a tube in which one end is sealed by<br>
flat heat sealing or folding, depending on the material<br>
being used in each instance. In one configuration, the<br>
access - existing prior to the heat sealing or folding - to<br>
the interior of the collapsible-tube-shaped container<br>
advantageously serves in addition as a supply option for<br>
the filling with the medicament which is subsequently<br>
received within the container and which is optionally<br>
released via the opening that is provided in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment, connection<br>
means are provided for detachable connection of the hollow<br>
needle to the container. The detachabiiity enables the<br>
container to be detached from the administration device, in.<br>
order, for example, to be able to attach a new filled<br>
container quickly. For example, for the purpose of<br>
detachable connection an extension furnished with an<br>
external thread is provided on the container, in which<br>
extension the opening is arranged concentrically. The<br>
hollow needle exhibits, for example, a recess interacting<br>
with the extension and receiving the latter. By virtue of<br>
the internal thread provided in the recess and interacting<br>
with the external thread, a detachable but simultaneously<br>
liquid-tight connection between the container and the<br>
hollow needle is achieved. The detachabiiity, according to<br><br>
the configuration, of the connection between the container<br>
and the hollow needle ensures that a container can be<br>
easily exchanged for a filled container, as a result of<br>
which the flexibility and rapidity of administration and<br>
hence the user-friendliness are enhanced.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment, the means for<br>
connecting the opening to the administration device include<br>
a locking means for preventing an unintentional loosening<br>
of the connection. For example, a screw device is<br>
furnished with a latching function which additionally<br>
secures the screw connection in the screwed-in state by<br>
means of a latching spring element. A loosening is<br>
possible only after this spring action, associated with the<br>
latching, has been overcome. An unintentional loosening of<br>
the connection is largely prevented in this way.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the<br>
container according to the invention, the means for<br>
detachable connection exhibit two conically-shaped surfaces<br>
complementary to one another. As a result, a simple and -<br>
at the same time - sufficiently tight connection is<br>
achieved. The container is preferably furnished with an<br>
extension having an outer surface tapering conically to the<br>
opening.<br>
According to one embodiment, it is a question of a Luer<br>
coupling (Luer cone or Luer lock). A so-called Luer<br>
coupling is defined in ISO 594/1. In general, it is a<br>
question of a coupling designated as male. By provision of<br>
such a coupling on the container, several working steps are<br>
eliminated in the course of administration of the<br>
medicament.<br><br>
According to another advantageous configuration, the<br>
connection means are formed, at least partially, integrally<br>
with the container. By virtue of this, the container can<br>
be produced particularly simply, cost-effectively and<br>
quickly, which is an advantage from the point of view of<br>
production technology.<br>
Integrality is achieved, for example, in a single<br>
production step or as follows: in a first step of the<br>
production, two pieces are produced which are subsequently<br>
heat-sealed or joined together. The decanter is then<br>
furnished with an integral part, in order to fill this with<br>
 the medicament. If use is. made of existing injection<br>
moulds, a bringing-together of two parts is an advantage in<br>
the case of a production process where plastic hoses or<br>
laminate hoses which form the actual container are heat-<br>
sealed onto a head part with the connection means or if the<br>
connection means exhibit a particular complexity.<br>
In another advantageous configuration, the container<br>
exhibits a volume of less than 5 ml. A volume of less than<br>
5 ml proves to be particularly advantageous, since a<br>
container, in particular a collapsible tube., can be emptied<br>
efficiently and uniformly in one stroke by simple pressure<br>
with the thumb. It has become evident that, as a result,<br>
the handling of the container, and hence the. administration<br>
of the medicament, is particularly simple and efficient.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment, the container consists<br>
of synthetic material, in particular polypropylene, PE,<br>
such as LDPE or PET. Also usable are PVC, PVF etc.<br>
Nowadays, new, heat-sealable synthetic materials are also<br>
being developed that can be employed advantageously for<br>
medicaments. The choice of synthetic materials according<br><br>
to the invention is restricted only to the extent that the<br>
producibility of the container according to the invention<br>
is guaranteed. As a result, the container can be produced<br>
inexpensively. Furthermore, by reason of the comparatively<br>
low heat-sealing and melting temperature, sealing of the<br>
container after decanting has taken place can be effected<br>
in a manner that is particularly non-damaging to the<br>
medicament. Moreover, in this way the batch information<br>
and/or expiry information can be easily stamped onto the<br>
outer surface of the container. These inscriptions<br>
accordingly have a long life.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment, the container consists<br>
of a laminate. As a result, there are further<br>
compatibility options. For example, an aluminium foil<br>
which itself does not touch the product but constitutes a<br>
heightened oxygen barrier may be inserted into the jacket<br>
of the container, and in this way the stability of the<br>
product is influenced favourably. Furthermore, preprinted<br>
labels, which for their part may again have a barrier<br>
function, may be inserted into the jacket (in-mould<br>
labelling). By virtue of this, even the affixing of -labels<br>
is dispensed with, and no adhesive becomes necessary that;<br>
could get into the product by diffusion.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment, the container<br>
is designed to be at least partially transparent. As a<br>
result, the filling-level or the emptying can be<br>
advantageously monitored.<br>
According to another advantageous configuration, the<br>
container is coated. For example, the inner surface of the<br>
casing in contact with the medicament is coated with a<br>
chemically neutral coating such as silicon oxide. By<br><br>
virtue of this, it is ensured that, by reason of the<br>
coating, the container achieves, in this respect, glass-<br>
like properties without exhibiting the disadvantages<br>
associated with glass: for example, risk of injury when<br>
opening glass ampoules and disposing of them, etc.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment, the casing of the<br>
container is designed to be at least partially clastic. By<br>
virtue of this, it is ensured that when the pressure on the<br>
casing is removed the latter is able to regain its original<br>
shape and the container can be emptied intermittently, for<br>
example in several similar movements executed in<br>
succession.' As a result, emptying can be effected<br>
particularly simply.<br>
According to another embodiment, the means for connection<br>
may furthermore interact with a seal intended for them, so<br>
that a particularly easy sealing of the container according<br>
to the invention - in contrast, for example, to the<br>
ampoules described in the introduction - is achieved. The<br>
seal is, for example, a separate plastic injection-moulded<br>
part which is screwed or fitted onto the hollow needle<br>
previously described. In another embodiment, the seal is<br>
integrally connected to the casing and is produced together<br>
with the container in one processing step, in order to<br>
protect the medicament received in the container against<br>
contamination. By virtue of this, the container together<br>
with the seal can be produced simply and cost-effectively.<br>
The sealing means include, for example, screw or plug-in<br>
caps and segments that are heat-sealed onto the casing and<br>
furnished with predetermined breaking-points.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing the<br>
container exhibits a step in which the container is<br><br>
produced in a plastics injection-moulding step, plastics<br>
injection-blow-moulding step or plastics extrusion-blow-<br>
moulding step. As a result, the container can be produced<br>
inexpensively, optionally together with the seal and/or the<br>
means for detachable connection to the administration<br>
devices. In another production process the jacket and the<br>
head part are produced separately and are heat-sealed to<br>
one another. Furthermore,' the integrality that is<br>
advantageous for the decanter and user can be achieved by<br>
two parts being produced separately by the manufacturer but<br>
being already assembled (e.g. stuck together and<br>
subsequently heat-sealed) to form one piece by said<br>
manufacturer.<br><br>

medicament or, to be more exact, the liquid is released<br>
from the container 1 via the opening 4 by pressure being<br>
exerted on the casing 6 in the region of 1, for example<br>
with the fingers. The casing 6 is sealed in airtight and<br>
liquid-tight manner on the side located opposite the<br>
opening 4 by a heat seal 2 extending in plane manner, as a<br>
result of which the collapsible-tube shape arises. The<br>
means of connection of the opening 4 of the container to an<br>
administration device which is not shown include a conical<br>
extension 5 formed on the casing. The contour of said<br>
extension is indicated in Fig. la by dashes, since it is<br>
partially surrounded by a sleeve 3 furnished with an<br>
internal thread, which is likewise part of the connection<br>
means. The conical extension may have been provided<br>
without the sleeve, and consequently forms a so-called Luer<br>
male coupling. If the sleeve has been provided with an<br>
internal thread, a structure arises that corresponds to a<br>
so-called Luer-lock coupling. The conically extending<br>
extension 3 as part of the connection means serves, with<br>
connection of a connecting element complementary thereto,<br><br>
for an infusion needle or injection needle by way of<br>
administration device (not represented in the<br>
illustration), in order to connect said device, on the one<br>
hand, in liquid-conducting manner and, on the other hand,<br>
tightly and detachably.<br>
The opening 4 is, for example, sealed at the outlet with a<br>
predetermined breaking-point, in which connection an<br>
arbitrarily shaped breaking aid 7 is attached by injection<br>
moulding, or with a directly cast-on foil or membrane<br>
which, for example, can be penetrated with a pointed<br>
object.<br>
Fig. lb shows another embodiment 1' of the collapsible-<br>
tube-shaped container according to the invention. Said<br>
container differs from the embodiment 1, above all, by<br>
virtue of the different design of the casing in the region<br>
of the opening. Furthermore, the hollow needle 9 according<br>
to the invention is shown which serves for connection of<br>
the container to an administration device - that is to say,<br>
for the introduction of said container into an infusion<br>
bag, for example. The hollow needle is formed integrally<br>
with the casing.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b show another embodiment 1' of the<br>
container according to the invention. Said container is<br>
furnished with a casing 6' which at the time of release of<br>
the medicament utilises the jumping-jack principle. In<br>
Figure 2b the casing 6' is represented in section. The<br>
upper half of the casing shown in the Figure jumps<br>
elastically inwards after a certain curvature has been<br>
exceeded after initial external pressure; this inwardly<br>
directed spring action brings about a displacement effect<br>
on the medicament held in the casing 6', and results in a<br><br>
release of the medicament via the opening. By reason of<br>
the predetermined spring action, a release is brought about<br>
in reproducibly independent manner after the first,<br>
triggering pressure on the casing 6'. Consequently the<br>
same quantity of liquid is always ejected. In cross-<br>
section it is evident that the upper half of the casing<br>
fits into the other half after pressure and so is also no<br>
longer able to spring back into its original shape.<br>
Figure 3 shows the embodiment that is shown in Figure 1<br>
with associated infusion needle or injection needle 10.<br>
The connection means 12 attached to the infusion needle or<br>
injection needle 10 exhibits an inner surface which tapers<br>
conically inwards to a point in such a manner that it Ls<br>
complementary to the outer surface 5 of the connection<br>
means of the container 1. By engagement of the two<br>
surfaces of the connection means 5, 12, a detachable<br>
connection between the container 1 and the needle 10 is<br>
established. This connection is additionally fixed by<br>
means of a screw connection between the internal thread of<br>
the casing 3 and the external thread 12 provided on the<br>
connecting part 11 of the needle.<br>
Figure 4 shows the use of the container 1' from Fig. 1b.<br>
The hollow needle 9 serves for connection to an infusion<br>
bag or infusion bottle 14, whereby a foiJ or membrane 13 of<br>
the infusion bag or infusion bottle 14 is penetrated, in<br>
order to introduce the medicament held in the container 1'<br>
into the bag or bottle 14.<br><br>
