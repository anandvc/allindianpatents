3. Making Ice-cream cup and lid in Palmyra Leaves.<br>
i. Title of Invention Making Ice-cream cup and lid in Palmyra Leaves.<br>
This invention relates of making Ice-cream cup and lid in the Palmyra Leaves.<br>
ii. The technology field of the invention<br>
The core technology field of the invention is creating non-_absorbability<br>
in the Palmyra tree leaves by any liquid substance.<br>
iii. Making process of non-liquid penetration status in the inner structure of a palm leaf<br>
Gather leaves from palmyra tree not above the age of 4 months. The leaves should be cut along with rachis from the tree at the time of 4 hours after sunrise. Otherwise it will not be used for seasoning. The cut leaves should be dried along with rachis continuously three days in the sunlight. During this process the leaves should be covered with air tight closure in the night time. After 3 days the leaves should be kept in the room temperature not above 34^ c and without any air moisture affection for another 7 days. Then the leaves should be dried in the room temperature of 12° c for another 5 days. After these 5 days the leaves should be made wet in the medium humid air for continuously three days. In between this wetting process once in every 5 hours the leaves should be dried with the air flow of 30*'c for an hour. After completing this process the leaves should be covered with an air tight closure, without any moisture air affection for another ten days. Then the leaves should be soaked in the potassium permanganate liquid for 6 hours per day for two days. During the soaking time, the liquid should stirred by pouring hot water not exceeding 80°c for 15 minutes in every one hour. After two days the leaves should be dried in the sunlight for 3 days. Then the leaves should be soaked in the boiling water not exceeding 80°c, for an hour and should be soaked in the Bio-softner liquid continuously for 3 hours. After completing these processes the leaves are converted into cup or lid within an hour. After converting it to cups or lids, they should be coated by wax and dried.<br><br>
iv. Object of Invention:<br>
The ice-cream cup made on plastic makes earth pollution and it does not decompose immediately. Also it takes very long time to decompose. Nowadays mostly paper made ice-cream cups are used. But the process of making paper itself gives more pollution to earth and water. The paper industry has notified as second largest polluting source of the world. So both plastic and paper cups make pollution to earth and water. Considering these, living without pollution is the best to humanity by using natural substance like palm leaves. But the palm leaf has easy water absorbing capacity. To make ice-cream cup, this nature will be a drawback. But by the way of indigenous natural sources, the non-absorbability status was created to the leaves. So the object of the invention is creating non-absorbability of liquids in the palm leaves. Using this technic, the palm leaves are made to the status of non-absorbability of liquids. Then the leaves are used to make cup and its lid.<br>
V. Detailed description of invention with reference to drawing<br>
The contents of detailed description of the invention are having follows;<br>
Pre-seasoning of palm leaf:-<br>
The requiring palm leaves used to make cups should be gathered from palmyra trees. The leaves should be at the age of 3 to 4 months only. The leaves should be collected and cut at the time of four hours latter of sunrise. The leaves should be cut along with rachis stem and this stem should be removed at the last stage only. After cutting the leaves it should be dried in the sunlight for seven days continuously. After completion of the above said days the leaves should be dried in the airtight closure position for 15 days. Then the leaves should be processed for getting non-absorbability of liquid status.<br>
Creating non-absorbability of liquid status to the palm leaves:-After pre-seasoning, the leaves should be covered with airtight closure in the nighttime. After 3 days the leaves should be kept in the room temperature not above 34^ c and without any air moisture affection for another 7 days. Then the leaves should be dried in the room temperature of 12°c for another 5 days. After these 5 days the leaves should be made<br><br>
wet in the medium humid air for continuously three days. In between this wetting process once in every 5 hours the leaves should be dried with the airflow of 30°c for an hour. After completing this process the leaves should be covered with an airtight closure, without any moisture air affection for another ten days. Then the leaves should be soaked in the potassium permanganate liquid for 6 hours per day for two days. During the soaking time, the liquid should stirred by pouring hot water not exceeding SO^c for 15 minutes in every one hour. After two days the leaves should be dried in the sunlight for 3 days. Then the leaves should be soaked in the boiling water not exceeding 80°c, for an hour and should be soaked in the Bio-softner liquid continuously for 3 hours. After completing these processes the leaves are converted into cup or lid within an hour. After converting it to cups or lids, they should be coated by food grade wax and dried. These wax coated cups or lids has the non-absorbing capacity of any liquid or any other liquid substances.<br>
Method of making ice-cream cup and its lid using with palm leaves:-<br>
After creating non-absorbability of liquid status in the palm leaf, the determined wall and bottom piece of cup should be cut from the inseparable area by the adequate cutter dye. Then in the middle rib of wall and bottom piece should be removed as such as flat. Then the pieces should be inserted into cup molding with hot melt adhesive machine. Before inserting the both pieces, these should be soaked in the bio-softner liquid for two hours continuously. After inserting the both pieces hot melt adhesive heat portion should be raised up to 80°c and it should be maintain up to 20 minutes. After getting down the heat from the cup molding machine and open the mould area and release the cup. Then the cup should be coated by wax and it should be made dry. To get lid of cup, the round size portion should be cut from the inseparable area of palm leaf using cutter dye. Then the round type lid should be pressed in the flat surfacing machine for 30 minutes. After that the lid should be coated by wax and made dry. The wax coated cup and lid can be used as ice-cream cup and its lid.<br><br><br>
