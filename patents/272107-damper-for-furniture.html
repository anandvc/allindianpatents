				<td>Damper for furniture<br>
The present invention relates to a damper for furniture, in particular for hinges, having a housing in which a piston connected to a piston rod is received so it is displaceabic, a fluid flowing through a flow channel on or in the piston during the movement of the piston within the housing, different damping forces being obtained during movement of the piston in different directions.<br>
There are dampei-s for furniture in which a microhole is situated in a piston, so that a fluid may flow from one side of the piston to the other during movement of the piston, so that the movement of the piston is damped by the fluid. The disadvantage exists in the production of such microholes, which are usually smaller than 0.15 mm, that the production process is time-consuming, because a high precision is required and also the tools are subject to high wear. In the event of small dimensional deviations, the resulting damping forces may differ greatly. In addition, microholes may be clogged easily by small particles. Therefore, the use of foam elements for volume equalization is not possible, because detached small particles could block the system. Finally, the wall is washed out in small microholes, so that the diameter enlarges after a certain time. The properties of the damper thus change.<br>
Furthermore, dampers are known in which the fluid flows via a ring gap between piston and housing wall. Extremely small dimensional deviations on the piston diameter or on the cylinder internal diameter also have large effects on the damping behavior here. Tolerances may add up and in particular the housing wall may bend outward and enlarge the ring gap in the event of change of the internal pressure. In addition, contaminants may also have a disadvantageous effect on the damping behavior here.<br>
A damping element for movable furniture parts is known from DE 100 54 904. A valve unit having an annular elastic slide valve is provided on a movable piston, which also causes damping to different degrees upon the movement of the piston in different directions. Tiie construction of sucli a valve unit is comparatively complex, however, and the above-mentioned problem of clogging of the flow channels may occur.<br>
A damper for movable furniture parts is known from DE 202 21 550, in which movable ring discs are provided, using which through openings in a piston may be entirely or partially covered. A differing damping force during movement of the piston in opposing directions may thus be achieved, however, the strength of the damping force is only poorly settable. If the flow cross sections are too small, high material strain and more rapid wear occur. If larger flow cross sections are implemented, the damping force remains too low for many applications.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a damper for furniture which is insensitive in use and may be individually adapted relatively precisely to the particular intended purpose.<br>
This object is achieved by a damper having the features of Claim 1.<br>
According to tlie invention, the cross-section of the flow channel is regionally changeable, in that the piston is movable in relation to a plate, the plate and/or the piston having radially extending grooves which form at least a part of the flow channel. The cross-section of the flow channel may thus be predefined relatively precisely, the plate mounted on the piston being easily producible and also being able to be replaced if needed. In addition, the damper may also be set easily to the particular intended purpose, because the damping force is primarily a function of the design of the flow channel on or in the piston, in particular the flow cross-section of the radial grooves, which not only form a screen, but rather also have the fluid flowing through them over a certain distance. This distance of the radial groove may be used entirely for generating friction forces and thus for a pressure drop of the fluid, which then causes the damping. In addition, the grooves may be produced significantly more simply than bored holes by boring tools, because burrs may arise, or openings in the injection molding method, in which injection molding skins may be formed. Due to the change of the flow cross-section between the <br>
plate and the piston, it may additionally clog less easily due lo contamination, because parts may not jam as easily due to the change of the cross-section.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the piston and the plate are mounted jointly on a piston rod. The piston may be moved in the axial direction to change the cross-section of the flow channel, so that a radial section between piston and plate has a type of valve function and the movement of the piston is damped more strongly in one direction than in the opposing direction. This is an advantage in particular in furniture, because the opening movement is to occur smoothly, but damping is advantageous when closing. The damping force may differ by a factor greater than 5, preferably by a factor of 8 to 12 in the opposing movement directions of the piston.<br>
The plate is preferably fixed on the piston rod and the piston is held with play on the piston rod. A damper may thus be provided using few components, in which the flow channel may be changed. The piston may annularly enclose the piston rod and be held so it is movable between a plate and a shoulder on the piston rod. The flow channel between piston and piston rod may thus remain constant, for example, corresponding recesses may be provided on an othei-wise cylindrical receptacle of the piston. A section of the flow channel running in the radial direction is changed in its cross-section because of the axial play of the piston. The narrowest cross-section of the flow channel may be formed there, which is relevant for the throttling properties. The radial grooves are preferably situated in such a way that two grooves lying diametrically opposite in relation to the piston axis are provided. This ensures a uniform damping force and prevents possible lateral forces in the radial direction, which could cause jamming of the piston.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the plate is situated on a pot-shaped receptacle of the piston. In addition, an elastic foam may be situated in the housing adjacent to the fluid, which may perform a ceitain volume compensation for the retracting and extending piston rod. For optimum spacc exploitation, the chamber having the elastic foam may be situated offset to the longitudinal axis of the piston rod, so that space present in a component is used by liie chamber and the damper may otherwise be implemented as very short.<br>
According to a further embodiment, lo change the cross-section of the flow channel, the piston is implemented as fixed and the plate as bendabie. The damper may thus be implemented in a simple way as a pressure damper, which is stiff when the piston rod is pressed into the housing, while the piston rod may be pulled out comparatively smoothly. The plate may be formed as a disc made of plastic, preferably a plastic film, because the strain of the disc is relatively low even in the area of the flow channel.<br>
A movable compensation piston is preferably provided on one side of the housing, which is guided sealed on the housing and the piston rod. A volume change due to the movement of the piston rod may be compensated for by the compensation piston. The compensation piston may comprise a seal or consist of it, the seal having an external seal lip pressing against the housing and an internal seal lip pressing against the piston rod, so that only a single seal is necessary. Furthermore, the compensation piston may preferably be pre-tensioned by a spring toward the inner chamber having the piston, which generates a slight internal pressure in the housing. The spring may be supported on the cover which is fixed on the housing and is penetrated by the piston rod, so that a construction which is simple to mount is provided.<br>
If the damper is implemented as a pressure damper, catch means, preferably having bendabie legs, may be provided on the piston rod and/or the housing for connection to a further component, because the tensile strains upon the movement of the piston rod are less than the retention forces of the catch means, so that the damper may be mounted and also retrofitted easily and rapidly.<br>

Figure 15 shows a detail view of a damper modified from the exemplary embodiment of Figure 10.<br>
A damper I acting on traction comprises a housing 2 having a cylindrical inner chamber, in which a piston 4 is guided so it is displaceable, which is retained on a piston rod 3. A sealing ring 5, which presses against the inner wall of the housing 2, is held in a groove on an external circumference of the piston 4.<br>
A plate 6 is fixed adjacent to the piston 4 on one end of the piston rod 3. The piston 4 is slightly axially movable on the piston rod 3, so that the distance between plale 6 and piston 4 is changeable.<br>
An elastic foam 7 is provided adjacent to the plate 6 on the unpressurized side in the housing 2, which ensures a certain volume compensation as the piston rod 3 is retracted into and extended from the housing. An inner chamber 8 filled with fluid is provided on the opposite side of the piston 4. The housing 2 is also closed by a housing cover 9. On the side opposite to the cover 9, the piston rod 3 is guided out of the housing 2 sealed by a seal 10.<br>
A middle position of the piston 4 in the housing 2 is shown in Figure 2. If the piston rod 3 is pulled to the left, the plate 6 presses against the piston 4. The fluid may thus flow out of the inner chamber 8 between piston rod 3 and piston 4 up to the plate 6, on which one or more radial grooves are provided, which may be recessed inside the plale 6 or in the piston 4 on the side facing toward the plate 6. This groove or these grooves form radial flow channels in the traction stage, i.e., plate 6 and piston 4 press against one another to form a seal. The narrowest flow cross-section is then formed in this area and the damper uses the corresponding throttle properties. The flow resistance of the channels through the piston is very much less than the flow resistance through the radial grooves, for example, by a factor of 5 to 500. <br>
If the piston rod 3 is moved in the opposing direction, the plate 6 is easily moved away from the piston 4, because the piston 4 is held on the piston rod 3 with axial play. The cross-section of the flow channel between plate 6 and piston 4 thus enlarges and the fluid may flow toward the inner chamber 8 with low flow resistance.<br>
The damper 1 is shown from the outside in Figure 3, the piston rod 3 particularly being fixed on a component upon installation in the furniture and additionally the housing 2 being connected to another component. An annular element is provided for this purpose on the housing 2, on which a spring leg 11 having a bearing pin 12 is implemented. A relative movement between the piston rod 3 and the bearing pin 12 and/or the components connected thereto may thus be damped.<br>
A slightly modified damper 1' is shown in Figure 4, which corresponds in the mode of operation to the damper of Figures 1-3, however. The damper 1' comprises a housing 2', in which a piston 4' is guided so it is displaceable together with the piston rod 3'. A plate 6' is fixed on the piston rod 3'. Furthermore, an elastic foam 7' is provided for a volume compensation. Instead of a cover, a closure screw 9' is provided on the side opposite to the piston rod 3', so that the housing 2' may be filled easily with a fluid. The damper housing is mounted by axially joining two housing parts, whose connection point is favorably located on the unpressurized side of the damper. The connection may be produced by welding, gluing, or using a peripheral undercut groove, for example.<br>
The flow channel between the piston rod 3' on the piston 4' is shown in detail in Figure 5 in particular. The piston 4' is held with axial play between the plate 6' and a shoulder 15 of the piston rod 3', so that the piston 4' is easily movable in the axial direction. A fluid may move to the right from the right side to the left side of the piston 4' upon movement of the piston 3', as indicated by the arrows. The piston rod 3' is provided with a cylindrical section 16, which is enclosed by the piston 4', on which axial openings are provided to implement a flow channel 17. The flow channel is deflected in the radial direction in the area of the plate 6' and at least one radial flow channel 20 is implemented between the plate 6' and a radial section of the piston 4'. The flow channel is subsequently deflected again and an annular flow gap 21 is implemented between the plate 6' and the piston 4'. The narrowest part of the flow channel is the radial flow channel 20, which is relevant for the throttle properties.<br>
The plate &amp; is not movable in the axial direction in relation to the piston rod 3' and is fixed on a shoulder 18 of the piston rod 3' via compression, a rivet 19, or via screws.<br>
The damper of Figures 4 and 5 is shown in Figures 6 and 7, it now being moved in the opposing direction and therefore the fluid now being conveyed from the left side of the piston 4' to the right side of the piston 4'. Because the piston rod 3' is pressed in the left direction, the plate 6' lifts slightly off of the piston 4', because the piston 4' is retained with axial play on the piston rod 3', until the piston 4' at least sectionally presses against the shoulder 15 of the piston rod 3'. The cross-section of the flow channel 20' is thus enlarged in the radial direction, so that the fluid may reach the opposite side of the piston 4 significantly more easily.<br>
The foam 7' is used to compensate for the differential volume which arises due to the retraction and extension of the piston rod 3' into or out of the cylindrical housing 2.<br>
The damper 1 or 1' is especially well suitable for furniture, such as hinges and flaps or door stops, because only slight damping forces are not to obstruct the movement during opening and, in contrast, higher damping forces are useful during closing to avoid slamming of a door. The cross-section of the flow channel 20 or 20' may be adapted to the desired damping properties. The flow channel 20 or 20' clogs less easily in the narrowest area due to the change of the flow channel by the relative movement of the plate 6' to the piston 4', in particular because it is also situated protected.<br>
Various exemplary embodiments for plates 6' which may be mounted on the piston rod 3' are shown in Figures 8A-8C. The plates have a central opening 61 for this purpose and small grooves 60 are implemented on the side facing toward the flow channel 20 or 20', <br>
two grooves being shown in Figure 8A, four grooves being shown in Figure 8B in the plate 6*, and six grooves 60 being shown in Figure 8C in the plate 6**. The number of the grooves and the cross sections of the grooves are decisive for the size of the flow channel 20, these being able to be adapted to the particular application. The radial grooves may, of course, also be introduced into the plate 6' instead or additionally in the piston 4'.<br>
The piston 4' of the damper is shown in detail in Figures 9A and 9B. The piston 4' has an internal cylindrical hole 40, in which the piston rod 3 is guided so it slides. At least one, more favorably three recesses 17 are provided on the hole 40 to implement flow channels, which form a relatively large flow cross-section for the damping fluid. This fluid may thus flow (almost) unobstructed at this point, the small cross sections having relatively great length which have a damping effect in the traction direction are formed by the radial grooves 60 of the plate 6' when it rests on the piston 4'.<br>
The piston 4' has an annular receptacle 42 around the edge for seal elements, which is delimited in the axial direction by two flanges 41 and 43. Known 0-rings or other elastic sealing rings may be used as the seal elements.<br>
The above exemplary embodiments show dampers whose damping action is in the traction direction. It is advantageous for connection points of the housing required for mounting to lie on the side of the piston facing away from the traction direction. It is thus not impinged with the high fluid pressure occurring during the damping procedure, and high pressure does not occur in the return direction because of the flow cross-section, which is now large. This has advantages in regard to the tightness of the configuration. A corresponding reversal of the principle also allows the construction of identically acting pressure dampers. For this purpose, the plate fastened on the piston rod is situated on the other side of the piston, the piston is now displaceable between the plate and the (riveted) stop located at the end of the piston rod. The join points of the housing and the foam in the cylinder interior are correspondingly also situated on the opposing end, i.e., on the side at which the piston rod exits. A housing part may thus be designed as a simple pot.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figures !0 through 13, a damper 101 is provided, which comprises a cylindrical housing 102, in which a piston 104 is guided so it is displaceable on a piston rod 103. A sealing ring 105 is received in a groove on an external circumference of the piston 104. The groove has a width which is greater than the cross- section of the sealing ring 105, so that it may be pressed into the groove in the event of excessive pressure by the inner wall of the housing 102 to avoid high friction forces during movement of the piston 104,<br>
A plate 106 is fixed adjacent to the piston 104 on one end of the piston rod 103 or on an extension of the piston 104. A compensation piston is received in the housing 102 on the opposite side of the piston 104, which compensates for a volujne change because of the movement of the piston rod 103. The compensation piston comprises a sealing ring 107, which is situated on a retention ring 111. The sealing ring 107 produces a seal to an inner chamber 108 in the housing 102, the sealing ring 107 having an external sealing Hp 112, which presses against the interior side of the housing 102, as well as an interior sealing lip 113, which presses against the piston rod 103. The seal 107 may thus simultaneously provide a seal on the piston rod 103 and also on the housing 102.<br>
The seal 107 and the retention ring 111 are pre-tensioned via a spring 110, which presses against the retention ring 111 and against a cover 109 on the opposite side. The cover 109 is only fixed by catches on the housing 102, because the forces as a result of the spring 110 are low.<br>
A catch element 115 is fixed via a catch lug 116 on a groove or indentation, which implements a partially open eye 117, on the piston rod 103, so that a further component, such as a furniture hinge may be engaged via the leg on the eye 117, i.e., simple mounting is possible. The catch element 115 does not detach from the piston rod 103, because the piston rod 103 is extended smoothly and the retention forces of the individual catch means are greater than the opposing forces as the piston rod 103 is extended. An indentation may be provided for the catch lugs 116 on the piston rod 103, so that no <br>
machining of the piston rod 103 is necessary. The piston rod 103, which is maae or meiai or plastic, may thus be implemented as very thin in diameter, preferably in a range between 1.5 mm to 3.5 mm, in particular 2.0 mm to 3.0 mm. Only a slight volume compensation is thus necessary as the piston rod 103 is retracted and extended.<br>
The damper 101 is implemented as a pressure damper, in which the force for retracting the piston rod 103 is at least five times, preferably eight to twelve times greater than the force for extending the piston rod 103.<br>
A flow channel 120 is implemented between the piston 104 and the annular plate 106, which is sectionally formed by two radial grooves 160 diametrically opposite to the axis of the piston rod 103. The external diameter of the plate 106 is less than the diameter of the piston 104. An opening 121 is left out centrally in the plate 106, so that the plate 106 may be put onto a pin-shaped end 119 of the piston rod 103 or the piston 104. The pin- shaped end 119 is then deformed to fix the plate 106, so that the plate is securely retained on the piston 104.<br>
A deformed end 119' is shown in Figure 12, which fixes the plate 106 on the piston 104 instead of on the piston rod 103, other fastening mechanisms also being able to be used. One or more through channels 122 are implemented in the piston 104, which extend parallel to the axis of the piston rod 103. If the piston rod 103 is pressed into the housing 102 (upper half of Figure 12), the plate 106 presses against the piston 104 and the grooves 160 form the narrowest flow cross-section of the flow channel between the inner chamber 108 and the opposing inner chamber 123. Therefore, the piston rod 103 is pressed in stiffly.<br>
If the piston rod 103 is pulled on (lower half of Figure 12), the plate 106 bends away from the piston 104, until the position 106' is reached, for example, and the grooves 160 are situated at a distance from the plate 106 and the fluid may flow from the inner chamber 108 through the through channels 122 to the inner chamber 123 without necessarily running through the grooves 160. A significantly larger flow cross-section<br>
may thus be used, and the piston rod 103 is extended very smoothly. For this purpose, the plate is implemented as bendable and comprises plastic, for example, preferably a plastic film PET, so that after a movement of the piston rod 103, the plate 106 again moves inlo the position adjacent to the piston 104 perpendicular to the axis of the piston rod 103. Instead of bending over the plate 106, it is also possible, of course, to lift the plate 106 off of the piston 104, as is the case in the first two exemplary embodiments.<br>
A damper 101 is shown in Figures 13A and 13B, whose housing 102 has an externally open eye 118 on one side, the externally open eye 117 of the catch element 115 on the piston rod 103 being shown on the opposite side. Both eyes 117 and 118 allow simple and rapid mounting of the damper 101.<br>
A further embodiment of a damper 1" is shown in Figure 14, which is implemented similarly to the exemplary embodiment of Figures 1 through 3. A piston 4" having an external sealing ring 5", at which a piston rod 3" is guided through, is guided in a housing 2" inside a cylindrical section. The piston rod 3" penetrates the housing 2" on one side and is sealed via a seal 10". A plate 6" is in turn situated adjacent on the piston 4", radial flow sections being formed between piston 4" and plate 6", as shown in the exemplary embodiments of Figures 4 through 9.<br>
A chamber 70 having an elastic foam 7" is provided for the volume compensation in the housing 2", which is situated laterally offset to a longitudinal axis of the piston rod 3", i.e., adjacent to an eye 11" for the rotatable mounting of the housing 2". The chamber 70 having the foam 7" thus does not lengthen the distance between the eye 11" for fastening the housing 2" and the diametrically opposite end of the piston rod 3", so that the installation space, in a furniture hinge, for example, may be used optimally.<br>
An exemplary embodiment which is slightly modified in the area of a piston 204 in relation to the exemplary embodiment of Figure 10 is shown in Figure 15. The piston 204 is displaceable in a cylindrical housing 202 of the damper. The piston 204 is fixed via a catch or bayonet connection on a piston rod 203 and has at least one axial flovv channel <br>
222. A groove is provided on tlie external circumference of the piston 204, in whicli a sealing ring 205 implemented as an 0-ring is inserted, so that the chambers 223 and 224 formed on diametrically opposite sides of the piston 204 are separated from one another via the piston 204 and the sealing ring 205. A slotted support ring 209 made of a rigid material such as plastic or metal is inserted adjacent to the sealing ring 205 in the groove, which avoids displacement of the sealing ring 205 in the gi-oove and may also compress the sealing ring 205 in the axial direction. This is because in the event of high pressures, the sealing ring 205 may otherwise slip in a groove in such a way that sufficient tightness is no longer ensured and the damper is no longer functional.<br>
A plate 206 is provided on the side of the chamber 223 on the piston 204, which is axially secured on a cylindrical extension 210 by a snap ring 207. The plate 206 is held with axial play between the snap ring 207 and a lateral face 208 of the piston 204, so that upon a movement of the piston 204, the plate 206 presses against either the lateral face 20S or the snap ring 207, and thus, as in the preceding exemplary embodiments, a flow channel in the area of radial grooves on the plate 206 and/or on the lateral face 208 is enlarged or reduced.<br>
An oil, in particular silicone oil, is preferably used as the fluid for the damper shown, but other fluids may also be used for the damping.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
