STABILIZED ELECTROCHROMIC MEDIA<br>
The present invention relates to compositions which are stabilized against degradation and yellowing during exposure to ultraviolet light, to the method of stabilizing the compositions, to the use of such compositions as media in electroactive devices such as electrochromic and electrophoretic devices, and the electroactive devices comprised of these media.<br>
Background<br>
A major problem which limits the usefulness and useful lifetime of materials exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is degradation associated with such exposure. This degradation results from decomposition and other chemical reactions of the materials initiated by absorption of ultraviolet light. Among the undesired consequences of these chemical reactions can be discoloration of the material. Among the materials that are particularly affected by UV induced discoloration are solvents that comprise the media of functional devices such as electroactive devices, including electrochromic and electrophoretic devices.<br>
Electrochromic devices are well known, e. g.f U. S. Pat. 4,902,108 and 6,178,034. Such devices undergo a change in electromagnetic radiation transmission upon application of an electrical stimulus and have found use in a number of commercial applications. For example, they may be employed in glazings, e.g.. energy efficient and privacy windows for architectural or automotive use, automotive rearview mirrors, displays, filters, eyewear. antidazzle and fog penetrating devices, and other applications where variable light transmission is desired. In many of these applications the device is routinely exposed to harmful environmental conditions, including exposure to UV light as from the sun.<br>
Electrochromic devices are typically associated with a noticible change in color. Changes in other optical properties, such as in the degree of clarity and opacity and absorption in the IR, are also characteristics of such devices. The compositions of the present invention can also be employed as part of other electroactive devices associated with similar activity such as liquid crystal and suspended particle devices, including, as examples, electronic paper and privacy windows.<br><br>
U. S. Pat. 6,614,578; 5,770,114; 6,207, 083 and 6,045, 724, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference, disclose solvent containing media for electrochromic devices which protect the device by absorbing UV light either through an intrisic property of the solvent or by the addition of UV absorbing additives (UVAs), e. g., benzotriazoles, benzophenones, cyanoacrylates and others.<br>
U. S. Pat. 5,148,305 claims compositions with certain cyanoacrylate UVAs in specified electrochromic soultions due to the greater solubility than similar solutions containing certain benzotriazoles, benzophenones, and/or oxanilides.<br>
U. S. Pat. 6,614,578 and 5,770,114 disclose media for electrochromic devices containing benzotriazole UVAs that are substituted with groups to provide improved solubility.<br>
U. S. Pat. 5,239,406, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses a multi-layered electrochromic glazing assembly, at least one layer of which comprises an additive for absorbing, blocking, and/or screening ultraviolet radiation. Said additive may be in one of the polymeric layers of the invention or in the electrochromic medium itself.<br>
U. S. Pat. 6,143,209; 6,327,069; 6,404,532 and 6,545,793, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference, describe electrochromic devices comprising a solvent and optionally UV absorbers including benzophenones, cyanoacrylates, salicylates and benzotriazoles.<br>
Even with the addition of UV absorbing additives, discoloration of the media upon exposure to UV light remains a problem. In addition to UVA's, other stabilizing additives, including hindered amine light stabilizers ( HALS ), have been used in electrochromic media, for example, U. S. Pat. 6,178,034 and 5,239,406, and U. S. Pat Appl Pub. 2002/0141032.<br>
Electrophoretic devices are also well known, particularly those comprised of suspended particles, e.g., U.S. Pat. 4,772,103;6,753,844 and 6,753,999 which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. They can be commercially employed in many of the same applications as electrochromic devises, e.g., glazings and displays and<br><br>
are subject to similar photodegradation. U.S. Pat. 5,467,217, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, discloses electrophoretic light valve compositions stabilized with UV light absorbers.<br>
Several classes of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) are known in the art. These classes are differentiated by the substitution at the hindered N-atom, for example, hydrogen, alkyl, acyl, alkoxy, hydroxyalkoxy, acyloxy. Polymeric deirivatives of HALS are also known.<br>
While the use of UVAs and HALS together is well known in the art of UV stabilization, e.g., U.S. Pat. 4,314,933, little guidance exists as to which HALS provide the greatest utility in preventing discoloration of the solvent comprising the media of electroactive devices such as electrochromic or electrophoteric devices.<br>
U.S. Pat Appl Pub no. 2002/0141032, specifically mentions the use of a N-alkoxy HALS. U.S. Pat. 6,178,034 generically discloses the use of mixtures of additives, including, among others, UVAs and HALS, in the electrolyte layer of an electrochromic device.<br>
We have found that certain HALS, substituted on the hindered nitrogen by hydrogen or alkyl are much more effective than others in preventing the yellowing of solutions containing UVAs found in electroactive devices. The presence os these HALS also extends the usable lifetime of the UVAs.<br>

For purposes of the present disclosure, the solvent containing component of the electrochromic device need not contain any of the functional elements, electroactive or otherwise, of the electrochromic device. In practice, however, one would expect that as the<br><br>
solvent is useful as media for the electrochromic materials it would contain some functional aspect of the device be it an electrolyte, anodic material(s), cathodic material(s), or any combination thereof, and may comprise other components as well, as understood in the electrochromic device art.<br>
The anodic active, cathodic active, and electrolyte materials, as well as the other materials of the electrochromic devices, and the concentrations used, can be found in the patents cited herein.<br>
Among the solvents suitable for the invention are those known in the art of solution-phase electrochromic devices to be suitable for the dissolution of one or more of an anodic electrochromic compound, a cathodic electrochromic compound, and / or a material functioning as a charge carrying electrolyte in order to provide an electroactive medium of an electrochromic device. For example, at least one of the one or more solvents is selected from the group consisting of sulfones, amides, sulfoxides, ethers, polyethers, alcohols, polyols, nitriles, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, cyclic esters, cyclic carbonates, glycidyl ether carbonates and silicon/polyol co-polymers.<br>
For example, at least one of the one or more solvents is selected from the group consisting of sulfones, ketones, nitriles and cyclic carbonates.<br>
Such solvents include, among others, commercially available 3-methylsulfolane, tetramethylene sulfone, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetraglyme and other polyethers, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, ethoxyethanol, nitriles, such as acetonitrile, glutaronitrile, 3-hydroxypropionitrile, methoxypropionitrile, 3-ethoxypropionitrile 2-methylglutaronitrile, cyanoethyl sucrose, ketones including acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, benzoyl acetone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, acetophenone, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, cyclic esters including beta-propiolactone, 2-acetylbutyrolactone, gamma-butyrolactone, gamma-valerolactone, 4-ethenyl-1,3-dioxalane-2-one, propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate, 1,2-butylene carbonate, glycidyl ether carbonates (such as those commercially available from Texaco Chemical Company, Austin, Tex.) silicon/polyol co-polymers, (such as those available from Genesse Polymers, Flint, Mich.), and combinations thereof and homogenous mixtures of the same.<br><br>
For example, at least one of the one or more solvents is selected from the group consisting of 3-methylsulfolane, tetramethylene sulfone, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetraglyme or other polyether, methanol, ethanol, ethoxyethanol, acetonitrile, glutaronitrile, 3-hydroxypropionitrile, methoxypropionitrile, 3-ethoxypropionitrile 2-methylglutaronitrile, cyanoethyl sucrose, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, benzoyl acetone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, acetophenone, acetic acid, beta-propiolactone, 2-acetylbutyrolactone, gamma-butyrolactone, gamma-valerolactone, 4-ethenyl-1,3-dioxalane-2-one, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate and 1,2-butylene carbonate.<br>
For example, at least one of the one or more solvents is selected from the group consisting of 3-methylsulfolane, tetramethylene sulfone, tetraglyme, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, acetonitrile, glutaronitrile, 3-hydroxypropionitrile, methoxypropionitrile, 3-ethoxypropionitrile 2-methylglutaronitrile, 4-ethenyl-1,3-dioxalane-2-one, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate and 1,2-butylene carbonate.<br>

More than one solvent may be used.<br>
The media comprising the solvent may also be dispersed within a polymer or co-polymer matrix as described in, for example, U. S. Pat. 5,928,572 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. This interspersed layer may exist as a free standing gel.<br>
Monomers with the appropriate polymerization initiators can be used as a monomer composition so that this composition can be in-situ polymerized after the cell has been filled by radiation, heat, or electrogenerated initiators to form a solid. Such processes are described, for example, in U,S, Pat. 6,020,987 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. 6,020,987, describes an improved electrochromic medium comprising at least three electroactive materials having absorption spectra when activated that add together such that the color of the electrochromic medium can be pre-selected by individually choosing the concentrations of the at least three electroactive materials.<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, the solvent composition need not contain any of the functional elements, electroactive or otherwise, of the electrochromic device, except for the UV stabilizers. In practice, however, one would expect the solvent to be used as a media for some functional aspect of the device be it an electrolyte, anodic material(s), cathodic material(s), or any combination thereof and may comprise other components as well, as understood in the electrochromic device art, e.g., tinting materials, heat stabilizers, infrared absorbing dyes, moisture scavengers, fillers, viscosity modifiers, etc. If an opaque layer is desired, such as in display applications, then the solution may contain at least one additive selected from the group consisting of inert inorganic oxide fillers, inorganic sulfate fillers, inorganic carbonate fillers, inorganic pigments, organic pigments, surfactants, plasticizers and dispersing agents.<br>
The composition of the present invention is also useful as the suspending fluid in electrophoretic devices, examples of which can be found in U.S. Pat. 4,247,175; 4,407,565; 4,772,103; 6,753,844 and 6,753,999 and U.S. Pat. Appl. 2003/002084 incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
Solvents useful in electrophoretic devices include organic solvents, such as halogenated organic solvents, saturated linear or branched hydrocarbons, silicone oils, and low molecular weight halogen-containing polymers are some useful suspending fluids.<br><br>
 solvents<br><br>
 include, but are not limited to. eposes, such as, for example<br><br>
liquids), Shell-Sol.RTM. (Shell, Houston, Tex.), and Sol-Trol.RTM. (Shell), naphtha, and other petroleum solvents. Silicone oils include, but are not limited to, octamethyl cyclosiloxane and higher molecular weight cyclic siloxanes, poly (methyl phenyl siloxane), hexamethyldisiloxane, and polydimethylsiloxane. Low molecular weight halogen-containing polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) polymer (Halogenated hydrocarbon Inc., River Edge, N.J.), Galden.RTM. (a perfluorinated ether from Ausimont, Morristown, N.J.), or Krytox.RTM. from DuPont (Wilmington, Del.).<br>
Aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, esters of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols and acids, and ethers of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols are also useful in such devices.<br>
Alcohols include methanol and 2-ethylhexanol. Esters include alkyl acetates including isopentyl acetate, alkylphenyl acetates including p-nonylphenyl acetate, diesters including dioctylphthalate, diisodecyl adipate, dioctyl sebacate and hindered esters including 3,5,5-trimethylhexyl isobutyrate, 3,5,5-trimethylhexyl neopentanoate, neopentyl neopentanoate and isobutyl neopentanoate. Useful ethers include di-2-ethylhexyl ether, di-3,5,5-trimethylhexyl ether, di-neopentyl ether and non-symmetrical branched ethers.<br>
The electrophoretic suspending fluid may comprise one or more solvents. Other materials common in the art may also be present, such as surfactants, water, polymers, surface modifiers, charge control agents and charge adjuvants. Reactants or solvents for the microencapsulation process (oil soluble monomers, for example) can also be contained in the suspending fluid.<br>
While the liquid suspension can be used as such as the light-modulating element, it is also possible to create a light-modulating film by having droplets of a liquid suspension distributed in a polymer matrix, e.g., U.S. Pat. 3,257,905; 3,341,274; 4,919,521; 5,463,491 and 5,463,492 which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Thus, a film suitable for use in a electrophoretic device may comprise a cross-linked polymer matrix having droplets of a electrophoretic suspension distributed in the matrix. This film may be swollen with a suitable liquid. This improves the frequency response characteristics of the resulting film and reduces light scatter.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. 5,467,217 and 4,407,565, incorporated herein in their entirety by reference, discribe fluid suspensions for electrophoretic devices stabilized against photodegradation by incorporation of UVAs, specifically benzotriazole and cyanoacrylate UVAs respectfully. No mention is made of other stabilizers such as HALS.<br>
The UVAs chosen for the present compositions must be of sufficient solubility in the chosen solvent to be contained at an effective level. For example, U. S. Pat. 5,148,305; 6,614,578 and 5,770,114 base their selection of specific UVA compounds based on the solubility of the UVA in the electrochromic media solvent.<br>
The present ultraviolet light absorbers (UVAs) are selected from the group consisting of the hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, the benzophenones, the benzoxazones, the a-cyanoacrylates the oxanilides, the tris-aryl-s-triazines, the cinnamates, the malonates, the benzoates, terephthalic and isophthalic acids with resorcinol and phenols, benzilidenes, and the salicylates.<br>
More than one UVA may be selected and used together.<br>
For example, at least one of the one or more ultraviolet light absorbers is selected from the group consisting of hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, benzophenones, and tris-aryl-s-triazines.<br>
The present hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole UV absorbers are disclosed for example in U. S. Pat. 3,004,896; 3,055,896; 3,072,585; 3,074,910; 3,189,615; 3,218,332; 3,230,194; 4,127,586; 4,226,763; 4,275,004; 4,278,589; 4,315,848; 4,347,180; 4,383,863; 4,675,352; 4,681,905, 4,853,471; 5,268,450; 5,278,314; 5,280,124; 5,319,091; 5,410,071; 5,436,349; 5,516,914; 5,554,760; 5,563,242; 5,574,166; 5,607,987; 5,770,114; 5,977,219; 6,166,218; 6,262,151; 6,392,056; 6,451,887; 6,458,872 and 6,614,578 the disclosure of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The present tris-aryl-s-triazine UV absorbers are disclosed for example in United States Patent Nos. 3,843,371; 4,619,956; 4,740,542; 5,096,489; 5,106,891; 5,298,067; 5,300,414; 5,354,794; 5,461,151; 5,476,937; 5,489,503; 5,543,518; 5,556,973; 5,597,854;<br><br>
