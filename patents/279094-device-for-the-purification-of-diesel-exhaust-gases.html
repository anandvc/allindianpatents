				<td>Device for the purification of diesel exhaust gases<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a special device for the<br>
purification of diesel exhaust gases, which device<br>
comprises, in the flow direction of the exhaust gas, an<br>
oxidation catalyst, a diesel particle filter with<br>
catalytically active coating, and, downstream of a<br>
device for introducing a reducing agent from an<br>
external reducing agent source, an SCR catalyst.<br>
The untreated exhaust gas of diesel engines contains,<br>
in addition to carbon monoxide CO, hydrocarbons HC and<br>
nitrogen oxides NOX, a relatively high oxygen content<br>
of up to 15% by volume. Said untreated exhaust gas also<br>
contains particle emissions which are composed<br>
predominantly of soot residues and possible organic<br>
agglomerates and which arise from partially incomplete<br>
fuel combustion in the cylinder.<br>
Adhering to future legal exhaust-gas limits for diesel<br>
vehicles in Europe, North America and Japan,<br>
necessitates the simultaneous removal of particles and<br>
nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gas. The harmful gases<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from the relatively<br>
lean exhaust gas can easily be made harmless by<br>
oxidation at a suitable oxidation catalyst. Diesel<br>
particle filters with and without an additional<br>
catalytically active coating are suitable units for the<br>
removal of the particle emissions. On account of the<br>
high oxygen content, the reduction of the nitrogen<br>
oxides to form nitrogen ("denitrogenization" of the<br>
exhaust gas) is more difficult. A known method is<br>
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of the nitrogen<br>
oxides at a suitable catalyst, SCR catalyst for short.<br>
Said method is presently the preferred option for the<br>
denitrogenization of diesel engine exhaust gases. The<br>
reduction of the nitrogen oxides contained in the<br>
exhaust gas takes place in the SCR method with the aid<br>
of a reducing agent which is introduced into the<br>
exhaust strand in a dosed fashion from an external<br>
source. As reducing agent, use is preferably made of<br>
ammonia or of a compound which releases ammonia, such<br>
as for example urea or ammonium carbamate. The ammonia,<br>
which is possibly generated in situ from the precursor<br>
compound, reacts at the SCR catalyst with the nitrogen<br>
oxides from the exhaust gas in a comproportionation<br>
reaction to form nitrogen and water.<br>
At present, in order to satisfy the upcoming legal<br>
standards, a combination of the different exhaust-gas<br>
purification units is inevitable. A device for the<br>
purification of diesel engine exhaust gases must<br>
comprise at least one oxidationally active catalytic<br>
converter and, for denitrogenization, an SCR catalyst<br>
with an upstream device for introducing reducing agent<br>
(preferably ammonia or urea solution) and an external<br>
reducing agent source (for example an auxiliary tank<br>
with urea solution or an ammonia store) . If it is not<br>
possible by optimizing the combustion within the engine<br>
to keep the particle emissions sufficiently low that<br>
they can be removed by means of the oxidation catalyst<br>
by direct oxidation with oxygen, the use of a particle<br>
filter is additionally necessary.<br>
Corresponding exhaust-gas purification systems have<br>
already been described; some are presently at the<br>
practical testing stage.<br>
For example, EP-B-1 054 722 describes a system for the<br>
treatment of NOx and particle-containing exhaust gases,<br>
in which system an oxidation catalyst is connected<br>
upstream of a particle filter. Arranged at the outflow<br>
side of the particle filter are a reducing agent source<br>
and a dosing device for the reducing agent, and an SCR<br>
catalyst. In the method described here, the NO2<br>
proportion in the exhaust gas and therefore the NO2/NOx<br>
ratio is increased by means of the at least partial<br>
oxidation of NO at the oxidation catalyst, with the<br>
NO/NO2 ratio preferably "being set to a predetermined<br>
level which is an optimum for the SCR catalyst".<br>
Said NO/NO2 ratio which is an optimum for the SCR<br>
catalyst is 1 for all presently known SCR catalysts. If<br>
the NOX contained in the exhaust gas is composed only<br>
of NO and NO2, then the optimum NO2/NOX ratio is between<br>
0.3 and 0.7, preferably between 0.4 and 0.6 and is<br>
particularly preferably 0.5. Whether said ratio is<br>
attained upstream of the SCR catalyst in a system<br>
according to EP-B-1 054 722 is dependent on the<br>
exhaust-gas temperature and therefore on the operating<br>
state of the engine, on the activity of the oxidation<br>
catalyst and on the design and soot loading of the<br>
diesel particle filter which is connected downstream of<br>
the oxidation catalyst.<br>
The untreated exhaust gas of conventional diesel<br>
engines contains only a very low proportion of NO2 in<br>
the NOx. The main proportion of the nitrogen oxides is<br>
nitrogen monoxide NO. As said untreated gas passes over<br>
the oxidation catalyst, NO is at least partially<br>
oxidized to form NO2. The rate of NO2 formation is<br>
dependent on the activity of the oxidation catalyst and<br>
on the exhaust-gas temperature. If a significant<br>
quantity of soot is deposited on the diesel particle<br>
filter which is arranged at the outflow side, then the<br>
NO2 proportion present in the NOx downstream of the<br>
oxidation catalyst is, with sufficient exhaust-gas<br>
temperature, further reduced. Since NO is predominantly<br>
formed from the NO2 during the oxidation of soot with<br>
NO2, however, no denitrogenization of the exhaust gas<br>
takes place as a result. Said denitrogenization must<br>
take place by means of the downstream SCR catalyst, for<br>
which purpose the NO2/NOx ratio must be set to an<br>
optimum value over the entirety of oxidation catalyst<br>
and diesel particle filter. EP-B-1 054 722 however does<br>
not provide any technical teaching as to how said<br>
setting of the NO2/NOx ratio in the exhaust gas upstream<br>
of the SCR catalyst can be realized over the entirety<br>
of the oxidation catalyst and filter.<br>
It is an important object of the present invention to<br>
provide technical teaching for setting as optimum an<br>
NO2/NOx ratio as possible in the exhaust gas upstream of<br>
the SCR catalyst in an exhaust-gas purification system<br>
of EP-B-1 054 722.<br>
A further problem which is not discussed in EP-B-1 054<br>
722 but which occurs in practice is that the "passive"<br>
particle filter regeneration which takes place in said<br>
system, that is to say the burning of soot, which takes<br>
place in situ, by oxidation with NO2 generated by means<br>
of the oxidation catalyst, is generally not sufficient<br>
on its own to prevent the particle filter from becoming<br>
clogged with soot, and a resulting rise in the exhaust-<br>
gas back pressure to unacceptable values. Applied<br>
auxiliary measures are necessary, which may be carried<br>
out by means of the for example additional "active"<br>
diesel particle filter regenerations when the exhaust-<br>
gas back pressure across the particle filter exceeds a<br>
critical threshold value.<br>
Said auxiliary measures include the additional<br>
injection of fuel into the exhaust strand upstream of<br>
the oxidation catalyst or into the cylinders of the<br>
combustion chamber during the exhaust piston stroke.<br>
The unburned fuel which passes into the exhaust gas<br>
from time to time by means of said device is burned<br>
across the oxidation catalyst with the release of heat;<br>
the oxidation catalyst is used as a "heating catalyst"<br>
in order to heat the downstream diesel particle filter<br>
to temperatures which lie considerably above the soot<br>
ignition temperature in the oxygen-containing<br>
atmosphere, that is to say in the range from 500 to<br>
650°C. As a result of the temperature rise which is<br>
obtained in this way, the soot particles are "burned<br>
off" with the oxygen contained in the exhaust gas.<br>
In order that the oxidation catalyst can operate as a<br>
"heating catalyst" in the "active" diesel particle<br>
filter regeneration, said oxidation catalyst must meet<br>
some demands with regard to conversion behaviour and<br>
ageing stability. Said oxidation catalyst must be able<br>
to convert high quantities of unburned hydrocarbons by<br>
oxidation in a short time without the oxidation<br>
reaction thereby being "flooded" and thus ceasing.<br>
Here, the conversion of the unburned hydrocarbons must<br>
be as complete as possible, since the breakthrough of<br>
unburned hydrocarbons through the oxidation catalyst<br>
can, at the latest at the SCR catalyst which is<br>
arranged further downstream, lead to the latter being<br>
contaminated. A breakthrough of unburned hydrocarbons<br>
at the end of the exhaust system may also have the<br>
result that the legal limits are not adhered to. The<br>
more fuel can be burned completely across the oxidation<br>
catalyst, the more flexible can be the strategy for<br>
active regeneration. Furthermore, it is an important<br>
requirement that the oxidation catalyst "ignites" even<br>
at low exhaust-gas temperatures (180 to 250°C).<br>
In summary, an oxidation catalyst which is also ideally<br>
suitable as a heating catalyst must therefore provide<br>
very high HC conversion rates even at extremely low<br>
exhaust-gas temperatures, wherein the HC conversion<br>
should increase as abruptly as possible to maximum<br>
values once the "ignition temperature" (light-off<br>
temperature) is reached. Furthermore, the catalyst must<br>
be sufficiently stable with regard to ageing that its<br>
activity is not impaired to too great an extent as a<br>
result of the exothermic energy generated during the<br>
combustion of the hydrocarbons. Said performance<br>
demands are referred to below in summary as "heat-up<br>
performance".<br>
It is a further important object of the present<br>
invention to provide an exhaust-gas purification system<br>
having the basic design described in EP-B-1 054 722, in<br>
which the oxidation catalyst exhibits the best possible<br>
"heat-up performance" in the case of an "active"<br>
particle filter regeneration.<br>
The two stated objects are achieved by a device for the<br>
purification of diesel exhaust gases, which device<br>
comprises, in the flow direction of the exhaust gas, an<br>
oxidation catalyst, a diesel particle filter with<br>
catalytically active coating, a device for introducing<br>
a reducing agent from an external reducing agent<br>
source, and an SCR catalyst, wherein the oxidation<br>
catalyst and the catalytically active coating of the<br>
diesel particle filter contain palladium and platinum.<br>
The device is characterized in that the ratio of the<br>
total quantity of palladium to the total quantity of<br>
platinum is between 8 : 1 and 1 : 15, with the ratio of<br>
platinum : palladium in the oxidation catalyst at the<br>
same time being no greater than 6 : 1, while the ratio<br>
of platinum : palladium in the catalytically active<br>
coating of the diesel particle filter is no lower than<br>
10 : 1.<br>
With the device according to the invention, it is<br>
firstly ensured that as optimum an NO2/NOx ratio as<br>
possible prevails in the vast majority of operating<br>
states, which are typical for diesel vehicles, in which<br>
significant nitrogen oxide contents are present in the<br>
exhaust gas to be purified. Secondly, it is ensured<br>
that the oxidation catalyst has a sufficiently good<br>
"heat-up performance" in order to permit an "active"<br>
diesel filter regeneration at important operating<br>
points.<br>
The invention is based on the following knowledge:<br>
It is known that oxidation catalyst with high levels of<br>
platinum content cause high conversion rates in diesel<br>
exhaust gases in the oxidation of NO to form NO2. It is<br>
also known that oxidation catalysts which have a large<br>
amount of palladium can provide extremely complete<br>
conversion of high quantities of unburned hydrocarbons<br>
in the diesel exhaust gas even at low temperatures.<br>
Unfortunately, catalysts with high levels of platinum<br>
content have the tendency to "go out" in the event of<br>
high prevailing levels of hydrocarbon content, while<br>
palladium does not have a sufficient level of NO<br>
oxidation activity. There is a conflict of aims here<br>
between firstly the demanded NO conversion performance<br>
of a catalytic converter and secondly its "heat-up<br>
performance". For cost reasons alone, said conflict<br>
cannot be resolved by means of a simple "addition" of<br>
the two noble metals palladium and platinum in the<br>
oxidation catalyst.<br>
The inventors have now established that it is<br>
advantageous if the significant contribution to the<br>
formation of NO2 takes place as the exhaust-gas flow is<br>
conducted across the diesel particle filter. This is<br>
surprising in that it has hitherto been assumed that a<br>
sufficient degree of "passive" filter regeneration can<br>
be obtained only by means of high rates of NO2<br>
formation across the oxidation catalytic converter in<br>
order to keep the number of supplementary "active"<br>
diesel particle filter regenerations as low as<br>
possible. The work of the inventors however suggests<br>
that an excess expenditure in "active" particle filter<br>
regenerations can be avoided with targeted distribution<br>
of the noble metals platinum and palladium over the<br>
oxidation catalyst and particle filter, and a good<br>
"heat-up performance" of the oxidation catalyst can be<br>
ensured while simultaneously setting an optimized<br>
NO2/NOX ratio in the exhaust gas upstream of the SCR<br>
catalyst.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the overall<br>
quantity of noble metal in the device according to the<br>
invention has a secondary influence on the NO2/NOX ratio<br>
which can be obtained downstream of the particle<br>
filter. In contrast, the platinum : palladium ratio and<br>
the distribution of the noble metals platinum and<br>
palladium over the exhaust-gas purification units<br>
oxidation catalyst and particle filter are of<br>
significance for the NO2 formation properties.<br>
In contrast, it has been found that the "heat-up<br>
performance" of the oxidation catalyst is improved with<br>
increasing noble metal content of the oxidation<br>
catalyst, assuming that the ratio of platinum :<br>
palladium in the oxidation catalyst does not exceed a<br>
value of 6 : 1. The ratio of platinum : palladium in<br>
the oxidation catalyst is preferably between 0.5 : 1<br>
and 3 : 1, particularly preferably between 1 : 1 and<br>
2.5 : 1. In order to simultaneously obtain an NO2/NOX<br>
ratio downstream of the diesel particle filter which is<br>
as optimum as possible for the downstream SCR catalyst,<br>
it is necessary for the ratio of platinum : palladium<br>
in the catalytically active coating of the diesel<br>
particle filter to be no lower than 10 : 1. The ratio<br>
of platinum to palladium in the catalytically active<br>
coating of the diesel particle filter is between 12 : 1<br>
and 14 : 1 in preferred embodiments.<br>
If said boundary conditions are adhered to, the ratio<br>
of the overall quantity of palladium to the overall<br>
quantity of platinum in the device may be varied over a<br>
very wide range, specifically between 8 : 1 and 1 : 15,<br>
preferably between 2 : 1 and 1 : 10 and particularly<br>
preferably between 1 : 1 and 1 : 7, as a result of<br>
which it is possible to provide cost-optimized exhaust<br>
systems for practically all diesel vehicles which are<br>
presently in use and at the testing stage and for may<br>
future diesel vehicles.<br>
The oxidation catalyst and diesel particle filter are<br>
typically present in the form of two separate<br>
components. Said components may possibly be<br>
accommodated in one housing, for example if only a<br>
small amount of installation space is available in the<br>
exhaust system of a diesel passenger motor vehicle. It<br>
is likewise possible for said components to be<br>
positioned in two different housings at different<br>
positions (close to the engine and/or on the underbody<br>
of the vehicle).<br>
The oxidation catalyst conventionally consists of a<br>
platinum- and palladium-containing catalytically active<br>
coating which is applied to a ceramic or metallic<br>
throughflow honeycomb body. Use is preferably made of<br>
ceramic throughflow honeycomb bodies which have cell<br>
densities of 15 to 150 cells per square centimetre,<br>
particularly preferably 60 to 100 cells per square<br>
centimetre. The duct wall thickness of preferred<br>
substrates is preferably between 0.05 and 0.25<br>
millimetres, particularly preferably between 0.07 and<br>
0.17 millimetres.<br>
The diesel particle filter consists of a platinum- and<br>
palladium-containing catalytically active coating and a<br>
filter body. Metallic and ceramic filter bodies, for<br>
example metallic fabric and knitted bodies, are<br>
suitable as filter bodies. Wall-flow filter substrates<br>
composed of ceramic material or silicon carbide are<br>
preferably used. The platinum- and palladium-containing<br>
catalytically active coating is particularly preferably<br>
formed into the wall of such a wall-flow filter<br>
substrate composed of ceramic material or silicon<br>
carbide.<br>
In the device according to the invention, an oxidation<br>
catalyst consisting of a platinum- and palladium-<br>
containing catalytically active coating on a ceramic or<br>
metallic throughflow honeycomb body, and a diesel<br>
particle filter consisting of a platinum- and<br>
palladium-containing catalytically active coating and a<br>
filter body, are suitably selected such that the volume<br>
ratio of throughflow honeycomb body to filter body is<br>
between 1 : 1.5 and 1 : 5. The volume ratio of the<br>
throughflow honeycomb body to filter body is preferably<br>
between 1 : 2 and 1:4.<br>
In a device according to the invention platinum and<br>
palladium are contained in a catalytically active<br>
coating both in the oxidation catalyst and also in the<br>
diesel particle filter. The noble metals platinum and<br>
palladium are preferably provided on one or more oxidic<br>
support materials. They may be applied separately to,<br>
if appropriate, different support materials, or may be<br>
provided together on one or more support materials.<br>
Here, the support materials are selected from the group<br>
consisting of aluminium oxide, lanthanum-oxide-<br>
stabilized aluminium oxide, aluminosilicate, silicon<br>
dioxide, titanium dioxide, cerium oxide, cerium-<br>
zirconium mixed oxides, rare-earth-metal sesquioxide,<br>
zeolite and mixtures thereof. Aluminium oxide,<br>
lanthanum-oxide-stabilized aluminium oxide,<br>
aluminosilicate, titanium dioxide and zeolite are<br>
preferably used as support materials.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the oxidation catalyst,<br>
platinum and/or palladium are provided so as to be<br>
applied to aluminium oxide and/or aluminosilicate as<br>
support material. In the preferred embodiments of the<br>
diesel particle filter, platinum and/or palladium are<br>
provided so as to be applied to lanthanum-stabilized<br>
aluminium oxide. The catalytically active coating of<br>
the oxidation catalyst also preferably contains<br>
zeolite. Whether zeolite should also be present in the<br>
catalytically active coating of the diesel particle<br>
filter is dependent substantially on the field of<br>
application of the device according to the invention.<br>
If the device is to be used for the purification of<br>
diesel exhaust gases in passenger motor vehicles, then<br>
diesel particle filters which contain zeolite in the<br>
catalytically active coating are preferable. In utility<br>
vehicles, however, an effective zeolite proportion in<br>
the catalytically active coating of the diesel particle<br>
filter often leads to undesired disadvantages with<br>
regard to the dynamic pressure behaviour, for which<br>
reason zeolite-free diesel particle filters are often<br>
more suitable here.<br>
The application of the noble metals to the stated,<br>
preferred support materials takes place using the<br>
conventional methods, which are known to a person<br>
skilled in the art, of injection, precipitation, the<br>
working process referred to as "incipient wetness" and<br>
other techniques known from literature. Which of the<br>
prior art methods is preferable in each case is<br>
dependent not least on the noble metal particle size<br>
which can be obtained using said methods and the target<br>
application.<br>
It was observed that particularly high yields can be<br>
obtained in the NO oxidation on platinum-rich noble<br>
metal particles with a mean particle size of 5 to 10<br>
nanometres. In order to generate such large, platinum-<br>
rich noble metal particles on the support material, it<br>
is for example possible to select a conventional<br>
precipitation-injection process using a noble metal<br>
precursor compound which sorbs only moderately on the<br>
support material. If a coating suspension produced in<br>
this way is formed into the wall of a wall-flow filter<br>
substrate, a catalytically activated diesel particle<br>
filter is generated which has an extremely high NO<br>
oxidation capacity in the newly-produced state. A<br>
component of said type is particularly suitable, in an<br>
exhaust-gas purification device according to the<br>
invention in combination with an oxidation catalyst<br>
which has a platinum : palladium ratio of no greater<br>
than 6 : 1, for the purification of diesel exhaust<br>
gases in applications with a very low operating<br>
temperature of the filter (mean temperature in NEDC<br>

For high-temperature applications or for the<br>
purification of heavily particle-loaded exhaust gases,<br>
when frequent "active" diesel particle filter<br>
regenerations are necessary, it is in contrast of<br>
relatively great importance that the exhaust-gas<br>
purification device and therefore the exhaust-gas<br>
purification units have a high level of ageing<br>
stability. The noble-metal-containing components<br>
preferred for such an application may for example be<br>
generated in that the usually oxidic support material<br>
is moistened with a suitable aqueous solution of a<br>
noble metal precursor compound, such that the pores of<br>
said support material are filled but it remains free-<br>
flowing. The noble metal is then thermally fixed in the<br>
pores in a subsequent fast calcination process. The<br>
noble-metal containing powder components which result<br>
from such a process may be processed to form a coating<br>
suspension, and applied to or formed into a throughflow<br>
honeycomb body and/or filter body.<br>
The application of the catalytically active coating to<br>
the throughflow honeycomb body and to the filter body,<br>
or the formation of said catalytically active coating<br>
into the wall of the wall-flow filter substrate takes<br>
place using the conventional dip coating process or<br>
pumping and suction coating process with subsequent<br>
thermal aftertreatment (calcination and, if<br>
appropriate, reduction with forming gas or hydrogen),<br>
which are sufficiently well-known from the prior art<br>
for these exhaust-gas purification units.<br>
All previously known SCR catalysts may be used in the<br>
device according to the invention. Particularly<br>
suitable are vanadium-oxide-based SCR catalysts and<br>
iron-exchanged and/or copper-exchanged zeolite<br>
compounds, which are known from the prior art and are<br>
commercially available. Also suitable are transition-<br>
metal-oxide-based SCR catalytic converter technologies<br>
which contain for example cerium oxides or cerium-<br>
transition-metal mixed oxides and/or tungsten oxide.<br>
The device is suitable for the purification of diesel<br>
exhaust gases and may preferably be used in motor<br>
vehicles. As the diesel exhaust gases are conducted<br>
through the device according to the invention under the<br>
conditions typical for this application, all the<br>
emissions contained in the diesel exhaust gas are<br>
reduced.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below on the<br>
basis of some examples and figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the NO conversion in the model gas as a<br>
function of the temperature upstream of the<br>
catalyst as a typical measurement result in<br>
the determination of the mean NO2/NOX ratio<br>
for the temperature range 200 to 400°C; the<br>
mean NO2/NOX ratio is obtained from this by<br>
determining the area under the curve<br>
(integration) and dividing by it the sum of<br>
the same and the corresponding integral value<br>
above the curve (up to 100%) in the limits<br>
200 - 400°C.<br>
Figure 2 shows the mean NO2/NOX ratio 200 - 400°C in<br>
the model exhaust gas downstream of the<br>
diesel particle filter in the systems SYS_1,<br>
SYS_2, SYS_3 and SYS_4 according to the<br>
invention and in the comparative systems<br>
VSYS_1, VSYS_2 and VSYS_3.<br>
Figure 3 shows the profile of the HC concentration<br>
downstream of the diesel particle filter as a<br>
function of the measurement time in a "heat-<br>
up experiment" in the model exhaust gas; the<br>
start of the n-dodecane dosing at t = 900 s;<br>
temperature in the reactor = const. = 250'C;<br>
end of test at t = 1800 s; for the assessment<br>
of the "heat-up performance", the magnitude<br>
of the HC breakthrough after the settling<br>
period (in the example shown, t = 1500 -<br>
1750 s) is specified.<br>
Figure 4 shows the HC breakthrough [ Vppm] in the<br>
"heat-up experiment" downstream of the diesel<br>
particle filter in the systems SYS_1, SYS_2,<br>
SYS_3 and SYS_4 according to the invention<br>
and in the comparative systems VSYS_1, VSYS_2<br>
and VSYS_3.<br>
Figure 5 shows the summarized result of the model gas<br>
tests - HC conversion [ %] obtained over the<br>
entire system in the "heat-up experiment" and<br>
mean NO2/NOX ratio in [ % NO2 in the NOx] for<br>
the temperature range 200 to 400 'C in the<br>
systems SYS_l, SYS_2, SYS_3 and SYS_4<br>
according to the invention and in the<br>
comparative systems VSYS_1, VSYS_2 and<br>
VSYS_3.<br>
Tests in the model exhaust gas:<br>
For tests in the model exhaust gas, various oxidation<br>
catalysts and diesel particle filters were produced.<br>
Noble metal quantities and ratios were selected so as<br>
to result in the same noble metal costs for all the<br>
devices comprising an oxidation catalyst and diesel<br>
particle filter.<br>
To produce oxidation catalysts according to the<br>
invention and comparative catalysts, homogeneous<br>
silicon-aluminium mixed oxide (5% by weight SiO2 in<br>
relation to the overall mass of the mixed oxide; BET<br>
surface area: 150 m2/g) was moistened with an aqueous<br>
solution of tetraamineplatinum acetate and<br>
tetraaminepalladium nitrate such that the pores of said<br>
homogeneous silicon-aluminium mixed oxide were filled,<br>
with the powder remaining free-flowing. Here, the noble<br>
metal content of the solution and the noble metal ratio<br>
were selected corresponding to the target quantities<br>
and ratio (cf. table below) to be obtained in the<br>
catalysts to be produced. To fix the noble metal, the<br>
moist powder was calcined for a duration of 4 hours at<br>
300oC. The catalytically activated powder obtained in<br>
this way was suspended in water, milled and applied, in<br>
a conventional dip coating process, to a cylindrical<br>
throughflow honeycomb body with a diameter of 118<br>
millimetres and a length of 61 millimetres. The<br>
throughflow honeycomb body had 62 cells per square<br>
centimetre and a cell wall thickness of 0.17<br>
millimetres. The resulting catalysts were calcined for<br>
a duration of 4 hours at 300°C and subsequently treated<br>
with forming gas at 500°C for a duration of 2 hours.<br>
The oxidation catalysts produced in this way are<br>
summarized in the following table:<br>
Remarks:<br>
• The total noble metal content in grams is in relation to<br>
the volume of the catalyst.<br>
• Catalytc converter identities with the prefix "DOC" denote<br>
catalysts according to the invention. Catalytic converter identities<br>
with the prefix "VDOC" denote comparative catalysts.<br>
To produce the catalytically coated diesel particle<br>
filter required for the systems, a lanthanum-oxide-<br>
stabilized aluminium oxide (4% by weight La2O3 in<br>
relation to the total mass of the mixed oxide; BET<br>
surface area: 180 m2/g) was moistened with an aqueous<br>
solution of tetraamineplatinum acetate and<br>
tetraaminepalladium nitrate such that the pores of said<br>
homogeneous silicon-aluminium mixed oxide were filled,<br>
with the powder remaining free-flowing. Here, the noble<br>
metal content of the solution and the noble metal ratio<br>
were selected corresponding to the target quantities<br>
and ratio (cf. table below) to be obtained in the<br>
coated catalysts to be produced. To fix the noble<br>
metal, the moist powder was calcined for a duration of<br>
4 hours at 300°C. The catalytically activated powder<br>
obtained in this way was suspended in water, milled and<br>
formed, in a conventional dip coating process, into the<br>
walls a cylindrical, ceramic wall-flow filter substrate<br>
(DURATRAP CO 200/12) with a diameter of 144 millimetres<br>
and a length of 152.4 millimetres. Here, a coating<br>
guantity to be applied was selected as 15 grams per<br>
litre in relation to the substrate volume. The wall-<br>
flow filter substrate had 31 alternately closed-off<br>
cells per square centimetre and a cell wall thickness<br>
of 0.3 millimetres. The resulting catalytically<br>
activated diesel particle filters were calcined for a<br>
duration of 4 hours at 300oC and subsequently treated<br>
with forming gas at 500°C for a duration of 2 hours.<br>
The following table shows which diesel particle filters<br>
were produced in which way:<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
• The total noble metal content in grams is in relation to<br>
the volume of the diesel particle filter.<br>
• Catalytic converter identities with the prefix "DPF"<br>
denote diesel particle filters according to the invention. Catalytic<br>
converter identities with the prefix "VDPF" denote comparative parts.<br>
The oxidation catalysts and diesel particle filters<br>
obtained in this way were subjected to a synthetic<br>
ageing process before being characterized. For this<br>
purpose, the parts were subjected, in a furnace at<br>
750°C for a duration of 16 hours, to an atmosphere<br>
composed of 10% by volume water vapour and 10% by<br>
volume oxygen in nitrogen.<br>
For subsequent tests in the model gas, drilling cores<br>
with a diameter of 25.4 millimetres were taken from the<br>
oxidation catalysts and diesel particle filters treated<br>
in this way. The test specimens obtained in this way<br>
were combined to form the systems listed in the table<br>
below, and tested:<br>
<br>
Remarks:<br>
• The total noble metal content in grams is in relation to<br>
the volume of the exhaust-gas purification units.<br>
• System identities with the prefix "SYS" denote system<br>
configurations according to the invention. System identities with the<br>
prefix "VSYS" denote comparative systems.<br>
The oxidation catalyst and diesel particle filter were<br>
installed into the reactor of a laboratory model gas<br>
system, wherein the oxidation catalyst was arranged at<br>
the inflow side and the diesel particle filter was<br>
arranged at the outflow side. First, the mean NO2/NOX<br>
obtainable downstream of the diesel particle filter was<br>
determined. For this purpose, the following test<br>
conditions were set:<br>
From the determination of the nitrogen oxide content<br>
and the NO or NO2 content in the gas upstream of the<br>
inlet into the oxidation catalyst (dosing values) and<br>
downstream of the outlet out of the diesel particle<br>
filter (measured values), the NO conversion across the<br>
entire system (oxidation catalyst and diesel particle<br>
filter) was firstly determined as a function of the<br>
temperature. Figure 1 shows a typical result by way of<br>
example. To determine the mean NO2/NOX ratio set<br>
downstream of the diesel particle filter over the<br>
temperature range 200 to 400°C, the mean NO2 proportion<br>
in the gas was determined, by integrating the NO<br>
conversion curve from 200oC to 400°C, and placed in<br>
relation to the sum of itself and the area above the<br>
curve (up to 100%) in the same temperature range.<br>
Figure 2 shows the NO2/NOX ratio obtained in this way,<br>
which is obtained as an average over the tested systems<br>
in the temperature range from 200 to 400oC.<br>
In a device according to Claim 1, in which a device for<br>
introducing a reducing agent from an external reducing<br>
agent source and an SCR catalyst for removing nitrogen<br>
oxides are arranged at the outflow side of the diesel<br>
particle filter, it is necessary, in order to ensure a<br>
continuously sufficient denitrogenization action of the<br>
downstream SCR catalyst, to obtain a NO2/NOX ratio of<br>
between 0.3 and 0.7. A NO2/NOX ratio of 0.5 is optimum.<br>
Figure 2 shows that, in the comparative systems, the<br>
minimum ratio of 0.3 is attained only in the system<br>
VSYS_3. In contrast, all of the tested systems<br>
according to the invention attain the minimum NO2/NOX<br>
ratio. The best results are obtained with the system<br>
SYS_2. In said system, the total Pd : Pt ratio is<br>
1 : 9.2. The ratio Pt : Pd in the oxidation catalyst is<br>
6 : 1. The ratio Pt : Pd in the catalytically active<br>
coating of the diesel particle filter is 12 : 1.<br>
Furthermore, a so-called "heat-up experiment" was<br>
carried out with the systems. In a "heat-up experiment"<br>
of said type, it is tested how well the system composed<br>
of oxidation catalyst and diesel particle filter can<br>
convert a sudden, very high concentration of long-chain<br>
hydrocarbon compounds in the exhaust gas. For this<br>
purpose, at a defined time in an otherwise steady<br>
state, n-dodecane is dosed into the exhaust strand<br>
upstream of the oxidation catalyst, and it is measured<br>
how many hydrocarbons break through downstream of the<br>
diesel particle filter. The quotient of [ dosing<br>
concentration - end breakthrough value] and dosing<br>
concentration also gives a steady-state conversion<br>
value for the long-chain hydrocarbons, from which it is<br>
possible to derive the intensity with which the HC<br>
oxidation reaction proceeds under said aggravated<br>
conditions. If the reaction ceases (the oxidation<br>
catalyst "goes out"), said conversion end value is<br>
below 10%.<br>
The table below summarizes the test conditions set in<br>
the "heat-up experiment":<br>
<br>
Figure 3 shows a typical result of such a measurement<br>
by way of example.<br>
Figure 4 shows the results obtained for the tested<br>
systems, with the HC breakthrough end values being<br>
specified in [ Vppm] . It can be clearly seen that the<br>
comparative system VSYS_3, which has the best mean<br>
NO2/NOX ratio downstream of the diesel particle filter<br>
(see Figure 2), also has, at 2350 Vppm, the highest HC<br>
breakthrough and therefore the poorest "heat-up<br>
performance". Unfortunately, a corresponding situation<br>
also applies tendentially to the system SYS_2 according<br>
to the invention. However, a cost-equivalent<br>
redistribution of the noble metal from the particle<br>
filter to the upstream oxidation catalyst while<br>
maintaining the noble metal ratios (-+ SYS_1) has the<br>
result, in such a system according to the invention,<br>
that the HC breakthrough can be lowered to far below<br>
1000 Vppm (in this case: 190 Vppm) without the NO2/NOX<br>
ratio thereby falling below the value of 0.3. Excellent<br>
"heat-up performance" is also obtained in the systems<br>
SYS_3 and SYS_4 according to the invention while<br>
maintaining good NO2/NOX rates.<br>
Figure 5 summarizes all the model gas results obtained.<br>
The figure illustrates the HC conversion [ %] obtained<br>
over the entire system in the "heat-up experiment", and<br>
for the mean NO2/NOX ratio for the temperature range 200<br>
to 400oC, corresponding values as a percentile NO2<br>
proportion in the NOx. The detailed illustration shows<br>
that the conflict of aims between "heat-up performance"<br>
and sufficient NOx conversion under the given<br>
experimental boundary conditions can be best resolved<br>
using the systems SYS_3 and SYS_4 according to the<br>
invention.<br>
In summary, it can be stated that all the objects<br>
stated in the introduction can be satisfactorily<br>
achieved by means of a system according to Claim 1.<br>
While adhering to the specified platinum : palladium<br>
ratios in the oxidation catalyst, diesel particle<br>
filter and overall system, it is possible, at all<br>
relevant operating points, to ensure a mean NO2/NOX<br>
ratio downstream of the diesel particle filter and<br>
upstream of the SCR catalyst of at least 0.3 while<br>
simultaneously ensuring sufficiently good "heat-up<br>
performance" of the oxidation catalyst, which is<br>
arranged at the inflow side, during an "active"<br>
particle filter regeneration.<br>
