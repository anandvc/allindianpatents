				<td>Monomeric Insulin Analog Formulations<br>
The present invention relates to monomeric analogs<br>
of human insulin. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to various parenteral formulations, which comprise a<br>
monomeric insulin analog, zinc, protamine, and a phenolic<br>
derivative. The formulations provide a prolonged duration of<br>
action. A process for preparing insulin analog-protamine<br>
formulations is also described.<br>
Since the introduction of insulin in the 1920's,<br>
continuous strides have been made to improve the treatment of<br>
diabetes mellitus. Major advances have been made in insulin<br>
purity and availability with the development of recombinant<br>
DNA technology. Various formulations with different time-<br>
actions have also been developed. Currently, there are<br>
generally seven commercially available insulin formulations:<br>
Regular insulin, semilente insulin, globin insulin, isophane<br>
insulin, insulin zinc suspension, protamine zinc insulin, and<br>
Ultralente insulin.<br>
Despite the array of formulations available,<br>
subcutaneous injection therapy still falls short of providing<br>
a patient with convenient regulation and normalized glycemic<br>
control. Frequent excursions from normal glycemia levels<br>
over a patient's lifetime lead to hyper-or hypoglycemia, and<br>
long term complications including retinopathy, neuropathy,<br>
nephropathy, and micro- and macroangiopathy.<br>
To help avoid extreme glycemic levels, diabetics<br>
often practice multiple injection therapy whereby insulin is<br>
administered with each meal. However, this therapy has not<br>
yet been optimized. The most rapid-acting insulin<br>
commercially available peaks too late after injection and<br>
lasts too long to optimally control glucose levels.<br>
Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to create<br>
insulin formulations and insulin analog formulations that<br>
alter the kinetics of the subcutaneous absorption process.<br>
Because all commercial pharmaceutical formulations<br>
of insulin contain insulin in the self-associated state and<br>
predominately in the hexamer form, it is believed that the<br>
rate-limiting step for the absorption of insulin from the<br>
subcutaneous injection depot to the bloodstream is the<br>
dissociation of the self-aggregated insulin hexamer.<br>
Recently, monomeric insulin analogs have been developed that<br>
are less prone to association to higher molecular weight<br>
forms than human insulin. This lack of self-association is<br>
due to modifications in the amino acid sequence of human<br>
insulin that decrease association by primarily disrupting the<br>
formation of dimers. See, e.g., Brems et al., Protein<br>
Engineering, 5_:6, 527-533 (1992) and Brange et al. , Nature,<br>
333:679-682 (1988).. Accordingly, monomeric insulin analogs<br>
possess a comparatively more rapid onset of activity while<br>
retaining the biological activity of native human insulin.<br>
These insulin analogs provide a rapid absorption to place<br>
injection time and peak action of insulin into closer<br>
proximity with postprandial glucose excursion associated in<br>
the response to a meal.<br>
The physical properties and characteristics of<br>
monomeric analogs are not analogous to insulin. For example,<br>
Brems et al. disclose that various monomeric analogs have<br>
little, or no, Zn-induced association. Any association that<br>
is observed is to a multitude of higher molecular weight<br>
forms. This differs dramatically from insulin, which is<br>
almost exclusively in an ordered, hexamer conformation in the<br>
presence of zinc. Brange et al. Diabetes Care 13: 923-954<br>
(1990). The lack of association attributes to the fast<br>
acting characteristics of the analogs. Because the analogs<br>
have lower tendency to associate, it is quite surprising that<br>
a monomeric insulin analog can be formulated to provide an<br>
intermediate duration of action.<br>
The present invention provides a monomeric insulin<br>
analog formulation that yields upon use an intermediate<br>
duration of action. The invention further provides a novel<br>
protamine crystal called insulin analog-NPD. The present<br>
invention also provides a mixture of insulin analog-NPD and<br>
soluble monomeric insulin analog. This mixture provides a<br>
rapid onset of action and an intermediate duration of action.<br>
Accordingly, the mixture possesses advantages over both<br>
insulin and the monomeric analog. The present invention<br>
further provides for a process for preparing uniform crystals<br>
of insulin analog-NPD.<br>
This invention provides an insulin analog-protamine<br>
formulation, which comprises: a monomeric insulin analog,<br>
protamine, zinc, and a phenolic derivative.<br>
The invention further provides a crystalline<br>
insulin analog-protamine complex. This complex has been<br>
defined as insulin analog-NPD. LysB28ProB29-human insulin-<br>
NPD comprises: a LysB28ProB29-human insulin, about 0.27 to<br>
about 0.32 mg protamine/100 U of insulin analog, about 0.35<br>
to about 0.9 % zinc by weight, and a phenolic derivative.<br>
This invention additionally provides a process for<br>
preparing LysB28ProB29-human insulin-NPD, which comprises:<br>
combining an aqueous solution of LysB28proB29-human<br>
insulin in a hexamer association state, and a protamine<br>
solution at a temperature from about 8° to about 22°C;<br>
said aqueous solution comprising from about 0.35 to<br>
about 0.9% zinc by weight, LysB28ProB29-human insulin, and a<br>
phenolic derivative at a pH of about 7.1 to about 7.6;<br>
said protamine solution comprising protamine at a<br>
pH of about 7.1 to about 7.6 such that the final<br>
concentration of protamine is about 0.27 to about 0.32 mg<br>
protamine/100 U of insulin analog.<br>
The invention also provides formulations that are<br>
both rapid and intermediate acting. The formulations are<br>
mixtures of monomeric insulin analog and crystalline insulin<br>
analog-NPD, wherein the ratio by weight of the two components<br>
is about 1-99:99-1.<br>
Finally, the invention provides a method of<br>
treating a patient suffering from diabetes mellitus, which<br>
comprises administering to said patient a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing insulin analog-protamine crystals.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a graphical representation of the<br>
profile of action of LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD and human insulin-<br>
NPH. The graph is µU/ml versus the Time of Infusion. The<br>
figure demonstrates the advantages of the present invention.<br>
FIGURE 2 presents a picture of AspB28-human<br>
insulin-protamine crystals of the present invention. The<br>
picture was taken at 1000x magnification with differential<br>
phase contrast.<br>
FIGURE 3 presents a picture of LysB28ProB29-hi<br>
protamine crystals of the present invention. The picture was<br>
taken at lOOOx magnification with differential phase<br>
contrast.<br>
As noted above, the invention provides various<br>
formulations of a monomeric insulin analog. The term<br>
"monomeric insulin analog" or "insulin analog" as used herein<br>
is a fast-acting insulin analog that is less prone to<br>
dimerization or self-association. Monomeric insulin analog<br>
is human insulin wherein Pro at postion B28 is substituted<br>
with Asp, Lys, Leu, Val, or Ala, and Lys at position B29 is<br>
Lysine or Proline; des(B28-B30); or des(B27). Monomeric<br>
insulin analogs are described in Chance et al., EPO<br>
publication number 383 472, and Brange et al., EPO<br>
publication 214 82 6, and are herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
One skilled in the art would recognize that other<br>
modifications to the monomeric insulin analog are possible.<br>
These modifications are widely accepted in the art and<br>
include replacement of the histidine residue at position BIO<br>
with aspartic acid; replacement of the phenylalanine residue<br>
at position Bl with aspartic acid; replacement of the<br>
threonine residue at position B30 with alanine; replacement<br>
of the serine residue at position B9 with aspartic acid;<br>
deletion of amino acids at position Bl alone or in<br>
combination with a deletion at position B2; and deletion of<br>
threonine from position B30.<br>
All amino acid abbreviations used in this<br>
disclosure are those accepted by the United States Patent &amp;<br>
Trademark Office as set forth in 37 C.F.R. § 1.822(b)(2).<br>
Particularly preferred monomeric insulin analogs are<br>
LysB28ProB29-human insulin (B28 is Lys; B29 is Pro) and<br>
AspB28-human insulin (B28 is Asp).<br>
The term "monomeric insulin analog-NPD" or "insulin<br>
analog-NPD" is a suspension of crystalline insulin analog and<br>
protamine in a formulation. NPD is Neutral Protamine<br>
formulation according to DeFelippis. The composition is<br>
prepared in accordance to the claimed process described<br>
herein. A related term "insulin analog NPD crystals,"<br>
"crystalline insulin analog-NPD, " or "LysB28proB29_human<br>
insulin-protamine crystals" refer to the insulin analog-<br>
protamine crystals in the NPD formulation.<br>
The term "treating," as used herein, describes the<br>
management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating<br>
the disease, condition, or disorder and includes the<br>
administration of a compound of present invention to prevent<br>
the onset of the symptoms or complications, alleviating the<br>
symptoms or complications, or eliminating the disease,<br>
condition, or disorder.<br>
The term "isotonicity agent" refers to an agent<br>
that is physiologically tolerated and embarks a suitable<br>
tonicity to the formulation to prevent the net flow of water<br>
across the cell membrane. Compounds, such as glycerin, are<br>
commonly used for such purposes at known concentrations. The<br>
concentration of the isotonicity agent is in the range known<br>
in the art for insulin formulations.<br>
The term "phenolic derivative" is m-cresol, phenol<br>
or preferably a mixture of m-cresol and phenol.<br>
The term "free base basis" indicates the amount of<br>
protamine in the formulation. Free base basis corrects for<br>
the water and salt content of the protamine salts<br>
commercially available and commonly used in parenteral<br>
formulations. The preferred protamine, protamine sulfate, is<br>
approximately 80% protamine.<br>
The term "IU" or "U" is international unit.<br>
The term "isophane ratio" is the equilibrium amount<br>
of protamine necessary to complex with the analog as taught<br>
by Krayenbuhl and Rosenberg, Steno Memorial Hospital report<br>
(Copenhagen), ,1:60 (1946). The isophane ratio is determined by<br>
titration in a manner well known in the art and described in<br>
Krayenbuhl, et al.<br>
The present invention provides an insulin analog-<br>
protamine formulation, which comprises: a monomeric insulin<br>
analog, protamine, zinc, and a phenolic derivative. The<br>
concentration of protamine is preferably about 0.2 to about<br>
1.5 mg of protamine to 100 U of insulin analog on a free base<br>
basis. Most preferably, the range of protamine is about 0.27<br>
mg/100 U to about 0.35 mg/100 U. The concentration of zinc<br>
is from about 0.35 to about 0.9 % on a weight basis.<br>
Preferably, the concentration of zinc is about 0.7 %.<br>
The phenolic derivative is m-cresol, phenol or a<br>
mixture of m-cresol and phenol. Preferably the phenolic<br>
derivative is m-cresol and phenol. The concentration of the<br>
phenolic derivative is known to one skilled in the art. The<br>
concentrations must be sufficient to maintain preservative<br>
effectiveness, i.e., retard microbial growth. In general,<br>
the concentration of phenolic is, for example in the range of<br>
1.0 mg/mL to 6.0 mg/mL; preferably greater than about<br>
2.5 mg/mL. The most preferred concentration is about<br>
3 mg/mL. The presence of a phenolic derivative is critical<br>
because it acts to complex the analog, protamine and zinc in<br>
addition to serving as a preservative. However, it is<br>
believed that only one molecule of phenol per molecule of<br>
insulin analog is bound to the crystal structure.<br>
Preferably, an isotonicity agent is added to the<br>
formulation. The preferred isotonicity agent is glycerin.<br>
The concentration of the isotonicity agent is, for example 14<br>
mg/mL to 18 mg/mL, preferably about 16 mg/mL.<br>
The pH of the formulation may be buffered with a<br>
physiologically tolerated buffer, preferably a phosphate<br>
buffer, like dibasic sodium phosphate. Other physiologically<br>
tolerated buffers include TRIS, sodium acetate, or sodium<br>
citrate. The selection and concentration of buffer is known<br>
in the art. Generally, the concentration is, for example,<br>
about 1.5 mg/mL to 5.0 mg/mL; preferably 3.8 mg/mL.<br>
The present invention further provides specific<br>
conditions under which the insulin analog-protamine exists as<br>
a stable crystal. Formulations of these crystals are defined<br>
as insulin analog-NPD. Insulin analog-NPD is a formulated<br>
suspension of insulin analog-NPD crystals and yields upon use<br>
an intermediate duration of action. The profile of activity<br>
of insulin analog-NPD is quite surprising in view of the lack<br>
of self-association of the monomeric analog.<br>
The ability to form an intermediate acting<br>
formulation with a monomeric analog is demonstrated in FIGURE<br>
I. FIGURE I discloses a profile of action for LysB28ProB29-<br>
hl-NPD and human insulin-NPH. The NPD profile is similar to<br>
insulin-NPH. The duration of action for the NPD formulation<br>
and the insulin-NPH formulation are approximately equal.<br>
However, most significantly, the present formulation rises<br>
more rapidly and remains stable for a longer period than<br>
insulin-NPH. This difference is quite unexpected in view of<br>
the fast-acting profile of the monomeric analog.<br>
A particularly preferred insulin analog-protamine<br>
formulation, LysB28ProB29-human insulin-NPD, comprises:<br>
LysB28ProB29-human insulin, about 0.27 to about 0.32 mg<br>
protamine/100 U of insulin analog, about 0.35 to about 0.9 %<br>
zinc by weight, and a phenolic derivative. The concentration<br>
of protamine is preferably 0.3 mg/100 U on a free base basis.<br>
The invention also provides the process for<br>
preparing LysB28ProB29-human insulin-protamine crystals,<br>
which comprises:<br>
combining an aqueous solution of LysB28ProB29-human<br>
insulin in a hexamer association state, and a protamine<br>
solution at a temperature from about 8° to about 22°C;<br>
said aqueous solution comprising from about 0.35 to<br>
about 0.9% zinc by weight, LysB28ProB29-human insulin, and a<br>
phenolic derivative at a pH of about 7.1 to about 7.6;<br>
said protamine solution comprising protamine at a<br>
pH of about 7.1 to about 7.6 such that the final<br>
concentration of protamine is about 0.27 to about 0.32 mg<br>
protamine/100 U of insulin analog.<br>
At the time of invention it was known that<br>
monomeric insulin analogs have a lesser tendency to associate<br>
and form hexamers. The conditions necessary to cause the<br>
monomeric insulin analogs to associate with protamine to form<br>
crystals were previously unknown in the art. Previous<br>
studies relate to insulin. The teachings regarding the<br>
preparation of insulin-NPH (neutral protamine formulation<br>
according to Hagedorn) or isophane insulin formulations by<br>
Krayenbuhl and Rosenberg, Steno Memorial hospital report<br>
(Copenhagen), 1:60 (1946) are not relevant in view of the<br>
distinct properties of the monomeric insulin analogs. In<br>
fact, the commercial process of producing Humulin-N™<br>
(insulin-NPH), an acid-neutral process, does not produce<br>
crystalline insulin analog-NPD.<br>
Most significantly, it has been found that the<br>
parameters in the present process -- namely, the temperature<br>
of the crystallization and the formation of a hexamer complex<br>
of the insulin analog, zinc, and the phenolic derivative are<br>
critical limitations to the formation of stable,<br>
LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD crystals.<br>
The temperature of the crystallization must be from<br>
about 8°C to about 22°C, preferably from 13°C to 17°C. If<br>
the temperature is outside of this range, a largely amorphous<br>
insulin analog-protamine formulation results.<br>
It is also critical that the insulin analog be<br>
transformed to a hexamer state prior to the crystallization.<br>
The crystallization results in an amorphous product when the<br>
process is carried out with a monomeric association state.<br>
Crystals form without agitation in five to thirty-six hours<br>
hours. Good quality crystals are generally formed in 24<br>
hours.<br>
Soluble monomeric insulin analog is complexed to a<br>
hexamer association state by suspending solid monomeric<br>
analog in a diluent containing the phenolic derivative and<br>
adding zinc until the concentration is from about 0.35 % to<br>
about 0.9 % on a weight basis. Zinc is preferably added as a<br>
salt. Representative examples of zinc salts include zinc<br>
acetate, zinc bromide, zinc chloride, zinc fluoride, zinc<br>
iodide and zinc sulfate. The skilled artisan will recognize<br>
that there are many other zinc salts that also might be used<br>
in the process of the present invention. Preferably, zinc<br>
acetate or zinc chloride is used.<br>
Dissolution of the insulin analog in the diluent<br>
may be aided by what is commonly known as an acid<br>
dissolution, In an acid dissolution, the pH is lowered to<br>
about 3.0 to 3.5 with a physiologically tolerated acid,<br>
preferably HCl, to increase solubility of the analog. Other<br>
physiologically tolerated acids include acetic acid, citric<br>
acid, and phosphoric acid. The pH is then adjusted with a<br>
physiologically tolerated base, preferably NaOH to about 7.1<br>
to 7.6 for the crystallization. Other physiologically<br>
tolerated bases include KOH and ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Most significantly, the process of producing<br>
LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD complex is sensitive to the concentration<br>
of NaCl. If the concentration exceeds about 4 mg/mL, the<br>
insulin analog-NPD crystals become mixed with amorphous<br>
product. Accordingly, it is preferred that the monomeric<br>
analog is dissolved at neutral pH to avoid the formation of<br>
salt ions. Alternatively, the analog may be dissolved in the<br>
diluent at an acid pH prior to the addition of the buffer.<br>
This reduces the concentration of salts generated due to the<br>
pH adjustment. However, the order that the constituents are<br>
added is not critical to the formation of the hexamer or the<br>
amorphous formulation.<br>
As previously disclosed, an isotonicity agent may<br>
be added to the formulations of the present invention. The<br>
addition of the isotonicity agent can be to the analog<br>
solution, to the protamine solution, or to the final insulin<br>
analog-NPD formulation. Likewise, the addition of the<br>
physiologically tolerated buffer may be added to the analog<br>
solution, to the protamine solution, or to the final insulin<br>
analog-NPD formulation. However, it is preferred that both<br>
the analog solution and the protamine solution contain the<br>
isotonicity agent and the buffer prior to combining the<br>
aqueous solution and the protamine. Because of the NaCl<br>
effects on the process for producing crystalline insulin-<br>
analog-NPD, glycerin is the preferred isotonicity agent.<br>
The invention also provides insulin analog<br>
formulations, which comprise mixtures of insulin analog-NPD<br>
as a crystalline solid and soluble insulin analog. These<br>
mixtures are prepared in a range of about 1:99 to 99:1, by<br>
volume suspended insulin analog-NPD to soluble insulin<br>
analog. The soluble insulin analog is a monomeric insulin<br>
analog dissolved in an aqueous diluent comprising: zinc, a<br>
phenolic derivative, an isotonicity agent, and buffer. The<br>
concentrations described in the diluent are the same as<br>
previously disclosed herein. Preferably the ratio of insulin<br>
analog-NPD to soluble insulin analog is 25:75 to 75:25; and<br>
more preferably, 50:50. The mixtures are readily prepared by<br>
mixing the individual constituents.<br>
The mixed formulations of the present invention are<br>
especially suitable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus<br>
because of the combination of a rapid onset of action and<br>
prolonged duration. These mixtures allow "fine control" by<br>
varying the amount of each individual constituent based on<br>
the needs, diet, and physical activity of the patient. The<br>
mixture of suspended insulin-analog-NPD and soluble insulin<br>
analog are also advantageous because they are homogeneous,<br>
i.e., any equilibrium exchange between the suspended crystals<br>
and soluble insulin analog is transparent.<br>
The insulin analogs of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by any of a variety of recognized peptide synthesis<br>
techniques including classical (solution) methods, solid<br>
phase methods, semi synthetic methods, and more recent<br>
recombinant DNA methods. For example, Chance et al., EPO<br>
publication number 383 472, and Brange et al., EPO 214 826,<br>
disclose the preparation of various monomeric analogs.<br>
The following examples are provided merely to<br>
further illustrate the preparation of the insulin analogs and<br>
the invention. The scope of the invention is not construed<br>
as merely consisting of the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD<br>
A solution of LysB28proB29-human insulin<br>
(LysB28ProB29-hI) at 200 IU/mL (U200) concentration was<br>
prepared by dissolving zinc containing crystals of<br>
LysB28ProB29-hI in a preservative/buffer system containing:<br>
1.6 mg/mL m-cresol, 0.73 mg/mL phenol (equivalent to 0.65<br>
mg/mL phenol calculated as 89 %), 16 mg/mL glycerin, and 3.78<br>
mg/mL of dibasic sodium phosphate buffer. The endogenous<br>
zinc level in the crystals was supplemented by adding an<br>
appropriate volume of an acidic ZnO solution (10 mg/mL) to<br>
achieve a final concentration of 0.025 mg/100 IU (0.7%).<br>
Dissolution of LysB28ProB29-hI was accomplished at ambient<br>
temperature by lowering the pH to about 3 with JJ.L volumes of<br>
5 M HC1. After the solution had clarified, the pH was<br>
readjusted to 7.5 with µL volumes of 5 M NaOH.<br>
A protamine solution was prepared by dissolving<br>
enough solid protamine sulfate in the preservative/buffer<br>
solution to achieve a final concentration of 0.6 mg/100 IU<br>
calculated on a free base basis. The pH of this solution was<br>
adjusted to 7.5 and equilibrated at 15°C.<br>
Both solutions were diluted to final concentration<br>
with water for injection and filtered. 5 mL aliquots of the<br>
LysB28ProB29-hI subsection were filled into separate clean<br>
glass vials, and the samples were incubated in a water bath<br>
at 15 °C. After appropriate time for equilibration (15<br>
minutes), precipitation was induced by rapidly adding 5 mL of<br>
the protamine solution to the LysB28ProB29-hI samples. The<br>
crystallization was allowed to proceed about 24 hours at 15<br>
°C.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD<br>
The process is identical to Example 1, except that<br>
the dissolution of LysB28proB29-hI occurs at neutral pH. The<br>
process was carried out such that the final pH was 7.4.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD<br>
Insulin analog-NPD was prepared in a manner<br>
analogous to Example 1, but the acid dissolution of<br>
LySB28proB29_;hi was carried out in the presence of all<br>
excipients except the dibasic sodium phosphate buffer. Solid<br>
dibasic sodium phosphate is added after the insulin analog<br>
solution was returned to pH 7.4. The addition of dibasic<br>
sodium phosphate clarified the solution.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of insulin analog-NPD mixture formulations<br>
Mixtures of intermediate and rapid acting<br>
LysB28ProB29-hI formulations are prepared as follows. The<br>
intermediate acting, suspension preparation is prepared by<br>
the methods described in Example 3 and serves as the<br>
intermediate acting section for the mixture. A separate<br>
solution of LysB28ProB29-hI (100 IU) is prepared by<br>
dissolving zinc-containing LysB28ProB29-hI crystals at<br>
ambient temperature in the diluent described in Example 1.<br>
The endogenous zinc level of LysB28ProB29-hI in this solution<br>
is supplemented by the addition of acidic ZnO solution to<br>
match the level in the suspension section (i.e., 0.025 mg/100<br>
IU (0.7%)). Water for injection is used to dilute the<br>
solution to final concentration after the pH is adjusted to<br>
7.4 using 10% solutions of HC1 and/or NaOH. This solution is<br>
the rapid acting section of the mixtures. The final mixture<br>
is prepared by combining appropriate volumes of the<br>
intermediate and rapid acting subsections to achieve the<br>
desired ratio. A 50/50 mixture is prepared by combining 1<br>
part of the intermediate acting section with 1 part of the<br>
rapid acting section by volume.<br>
Example 5<br>
Effect of ionic strength on LysB28ProB29-hI protamine<br>
crystallization<br>
The effect of ionic strength on the crystallization<br>
was evaluated by the addition of NaCl to the LysB28ProB29-hI<br>
section prior to mixing with protamine. NaCl was added so<br>
that the total concentration was 20, 30, and 40 mM (1.2, 1.8,<br>
and 2.3 mg/ml). The volume particle size displayed multi-<br>
modal behaviour (additional peaks at small particle sizes),<br>
as the NaCl concentration was increased. The volume mean<br>
particle size decreased as NaCl concentration was increased<br>
indicating an increase in amorphous material. Results of<br>
particle size vs. NaCl concentration are as follows:<br><br>
The microscope analysis showed that all samples contained a<br>
mixture of amorphous and crystalline material. The sample<br>
containing 40 mM NaCl had mostly amorphous material and very<br>
few crystals.<br>
Example 6<br>
Comparative dynamics of LysB28ProB29-hI-NPD and human<br>
insulin-NPH<br>
This study was carried out in a conscious dog<br>
model. Prior to the commencement of the study, three basal<br>
samples were taken. An infusion of somatostatin (0.3 µg/Kg-<br>
min.) was initiated. After a 10 minute interval, a<br>
subcutaneous injection of either NPD or NPH was administered.<br>
Frequent monitoring of plasma glucose was initiated and a<br>
variable glucose (20%) infusion was given so as to maintain<br>
near-normal glycemia. Samples were taken throughout and were<br>
analyzed for immunoreactive insulin (Linco antibody) and<br>
glucose. The results are illustrated in FIGURE 1.<br>

phenol calculated as 89 %), 16 mg/mL glycerin, and 3.78 mg/mL<br>
dibasic sodium phosphate. Zinc was added to the system using<br>
an appropriate volume of an acidic ZnO solution (10 mg/mL) to<br>
obtain a final concentration of 0.025 mg/100 IU. Dissolution<br>
of Asp(B28) was achieved at ambient temperature at neutral<br>
pH. The final pH of the section was 7.4.<br>
A crystallization was carried as described in Example 2.<br>
Final protamine concentrations of 0.3 mg/lOOU, 0.35 mg/lOOU,<br>

The crystallization Asp(B28) Protamine was performed as<br>
described in Example 7, except that the protein was first<br>
dissolved in a buffer-free diluent. The addition of the<br>
acidic ZnO stock was sufficient to acidify the sample to pH<br>
2.0-2.5. After the solution had clarified, the pH was<br>
readjusted to approximately pH 7 with UL volumes of 5 N NaOH.<br>
Sodium phosphate, dibasic, was added using a concentrated<br>
stock solution at 47.25 mg/mL to achieve the final<br>
concentration of 3.78 mg/mL. The subsection was adjusted to<br>
pH 7.4 using UL quantities of HC1.<br>

Example 12<br>
Asp(B28) Analog-Protamine<br>
A insulin Asp(B28)-human insulin analog solution<br>
was prepared by dissolving 16.6 mg of the protein in 1 mL of<br>
a solution containing 3.2 mg/mL m-cresol, 1.3 mg/mL phenol<br>
and 32 mg/mL glycerin. A 14.4 (XL aliquot of an acidic zinc<br>
stock solution (10 mg/mL in Zn2+, prepared by dissolving<br>
0.311 g of zinc oxide in 5 mL of 10% HCl and diluting to 25<br>
mL with water).. The solution pH was 2.3 which allowed for<br>
complete dissolution of the protein. A 10 µL aliquot of 10%<br>
NaOH was added to adjust the pH to 7.06. To the solution was<br>
added 100 (XL of 0.28 M dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 which<br>
increased the solution pH to 7.27. A 870 µL aliquot of water<br>
for injection was added to the solution. Additional 10% HC1<br>
(1 µL) and NaOH (0.7 µL) were added, and the final volume of<br>
the solution was brought to 2 mL with water for injection<br>
resulting in a final pH of 7.26. The solution was filtered<br>
through a 0.2 µm Supor® Acrodisc® 13, Gelman Sciences) filter<br>
before use.<br>
Protamine stock solutions were prepared by<br>
dissolving protamine sulfate in a solution containing 1.6<br>
mg/mL m-cresol, 0.65 mg/mL phenol, 16 mg/mL glycerin and 14<br>
mM dibasic sodium phosphate. The final pH of the solution<br>
was adjusted to 7.3. The final protamine concentration was<br>
0.60 mg/100U on a free base basis. Both solutions were<br>
filtered through 0.22 [to (Millipore Sterivex™-GV) filter<br>
units before use.<br>
Crystallization was achieved by mixing the<br>
Asp(B28)-human insulin solution in a 1:1 ratio at controlled<br>
temperature as outlined in Table 1. The final mixture<br>
conditions were 3.94 mg/mL Asp(B28)-human insulin, 0.03 59<br>
mg/mL (0.9%) zinc ions, 1.6 mg/mL m-cresol, 0.65 mg/mL<br>
phenol, 16 mg/mL glycerin, 14 mM dibasic sodium phosphate and<br>
0.30 mg/lOOU of protamine at pH 7.3. Specifically, 50-200 µL<br>
portions of the AspB28-human insulin solution were<br>
transferred to glass vials, and the samples were equilibrated<br>
to 4, 8, 15 or 23 (ambient temperature) °C. Portions of both<br>
protamine solutions were also equilibrated at these<br>
temperatures. After 15-20 minutes, an equivalent volume of<br>
either protamine solution was pipetted into the Asp(B28)-<br>
human insulin samples. The mixture was gently swirled,<br>
capped and then left quiescent at controlled temperature<br>
during the crystallization period. All of the samples were<br>
examined by microscopy after 24 hours and found to be<br>
predominantly amorphous. After 48 hours, the sample<br>
containing 0.30 mg/100 U of protamine and incubated at 15 °C<br>
showed extensive amounts of needle-like crystals and some<br>
amorphous material.<br>
Example 13<br>
A insulin Asp(B28)-human insulin analog solution<br>
was prepared by dissolving 10.62 mg of the protein in 0.71 mL<br>

and 32 mg/mL glycerin. A 10.2 |1L aliquot of an acidic zinc<br>
stock solution (10 mg/mL in Zn2+, prepared by dissolving<br>
0.311 g of zinc oxide in 5 mL of 10% HC1 and diluting to 25<br>
mL with water)/. The solution pH was 2.3 which allowed for<br>
complete dissolution of the protein. A 6.5 µL aliquot of 10%<br>
NaOH was added to adjust the pH to 7.00. To the solution was<br>
added 71 µL of 0.28 M dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 which<br>
increased the solution pH to 7.26. A 620 µL aliquot of water<br>
for injection was added to the solution. Additional 10% HC1<br>
(0.2 µL) and NaOH (0.6 µL) were added, and the final volume<br>
of the solution was brought to 1.42 mL with water for<br>
injection resulting in a final pH of 7.42. The solution was<br>
filtered through a 0 . 2 µm Supor® Acrodisc® 13, Gelman<br>
Sciences) filter before use.<br>
A protamine stock solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving protamine sulfate in a solution containing 1.6<br>

mM dibasic sodium phosphate. The final pH of the solution<br>
was adjusted to 7.4, and the final protamine concentration<br>
was 0.60 mg/100U on a free base basis. The solution was<br>
filtered through a 0.22 |im (Millipore Sterivex™-GV) filter<br>
unit before use.<br>
Crystallization was achieved by mixing the<br>
Asp(B28)-human insulin solution in a 1:1 ratio with the<br>
protamine solution as described in Example 12 at controlled<br>
temperatures 13°C, 15°C, 17°C and 23°C. The results are<br>

1.6 mg/mL m-cresol, 0.65 mg/mL phenol, 16 mg/mL glycerin, 14<br>
mM dibasic sodium phosphate and 0.30 mg/lOOU of protamine at<br>
pH 7.4. Four different crystallization temperatures were<br>
evaluated. A 1 mL aliquot of the AspB28-human insulin<br>
equilibrated at 15 °C was mixed with 1 mL of the protamine<br>
solution adjusted to the same temperature. After gentle<br>
swirling the preparation was left quiescent at 15 °C.<br>
Another sample was prepared by equilibrating 100 p.L of the<br>
Asp(B28)-human insulin solution to 13 °C, and then combining<br>
with 100 µL of the protamine solution adjusted to the same<br>
temperature. The final mixture was incubated at 13 °C. The<br>
third sample was prepared in a similar manner except that the<br>
two 100 µL aliquots were equilibrated, combined and then<br>
