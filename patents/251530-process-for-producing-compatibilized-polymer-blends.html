PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/680,961, filed March 1, 2007 and entitled "UV RESISTANT MULTILAYERED CELLULAR CONFINEMENT SYSTEM"; to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/680,979, filed March 1, 2007 and entitled "GEOTECHNICAL ARTICLES"; to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/680,987, filed March 1, 2007 and entitled "HIGH PERFORMANCE GEOSYNTHETIC ARTICLE"; and, to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/680,996, filed March 1, 2007 and entitled "WELDING PROCESS AND GEOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS THEREOF". All four of these patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present disclosure relates to a process for producing compatibilized blends of a first polymer and a second polymer to form a variety of articles having improved properties. More specifically, the disclosure relates to a process for manufacturing blends/compositions of a first relatively flexible polymer and a second relatively rigid polymer, as well as articles formed from such compatibilized polymer blends/compositions.<br>
Compatibilized blends of relatively flexible hydrophobic polymers, such as polyolefins (PO), and relatively hydrophilic rigid polymers, such as engineering thermoplastic (ET) resins, have been made. However, due to the incompatible nature of the polyolefins and the engineering thermoplastic resins, and to the methods that have been used to form the blends, the products made therefrom have not exhibited optimal performance. The blends often exhibit large domains of one discontinuous phase dispersed within a continuous phase. In most cases, the discontinuous phase is made up of the minor component of the blend, and the continuous phase is made up of the major component of the blend.<br>
Conventional methods of obtaining a compatibilized blend also require a multiple step process, wherein in a first apparatus, a polyolefin or other polymer is functionalized to form a compatibilizer, the compatibilizer is isolated, e.g. as pellets or powder, and the compatibilizer is subsequently mixed with the engineering thermoplastic in a second mixing apparatus. The product made from mixing the compatibilizer with the engineering thermoplastic resin is then isolated, e.g. formed as pellets, and subsequently used to form final, end-use articles or products. This plurality of steps is labor intensive, consumes excessive amounts of energy, and causes undesirable degradation of the polymer blend in the subsequent remelting and product formation steps.<br>
Moreover, attempts to provide the engineering thermoplastic downstream in the same machine that is producing the compatibilizer have failed. This is generally due to poor melting of the solid engineering thermoplastic in the molten compatibilizer. The reason for this concerns differences in the melting temperatures.   While most<br>
-2-<br><br>
polyolefins melt in the range of 50 to 165°C( typical engineering thermoplastic melt in the range of 200-300°C (Polyamide 6, Polyamide 66, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), etc.).<br>
For example, in conventional methods, a compatibilizer may be formed "in-house" or purchased from a specialty manufacturer. This compatibilizer is then mixed with an appropriate combination of solid polyolefin and engineering thermoplastic (in the form of pellets, flakes, granules or powder) and melt kneaded (usually in an the extruder or co-kneader) to yield a product, e.g. pellets of the compatibilized blend. Usually, due to differences in melting temperature, the fraction of the engineering thermoplastic polymer is greater than the fraction of the lower melting polymer, in order to enable enough friction between the extruder screw and barrel during melting phase. Due to these limitations, typical compatibilized blends comprise about 5-30% w/w of the lower melting temperature polymer. The pellets are then subsequently provided to another machine to form the final, end-use product. The compatibilizer, whether purchased from the specialty manufacturer, or formed in a separate "in-house" process, is expensive. Moreover, the energy that is invested to melt and graft the monomers to form the compatibilizer is lost during subsequent cooling and pelletizing steps. The need to remelt the compatibilized blend in the process of forming the final, end-use product results in a waste of about 30-60 USD($)/ton in lost energy and also results in degradation of the polymer blend.<br>
Another deficiency of the present technologies of forming alloys (blends that have useful physical properties) of polyolefins or other low melting polymers (styrenic for example) with engineering thermoplastics with higher strength, stiffness and melting point (Polyamide 6, Polyamide 66, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), etc.) is a limitation derived from the different melting temperatures: since the polyolefin melts first, the engineering thermoplastics are not melted well if a blend of dry pellets or powders or flakes of both is fed to an extruder or similar melt kneader. The reason for that is once the lower melting temperature polymer is melted, the molten material lubricates the pellets of the higher melting point polymer and avoids the essential friction of the pellets with the extruder barrel. Due to this, alloys typically comprise more than 60% engineering thermoplastics and less than 40% polyolefin (for example Orgalloy™ by Arkema). In order to manufacture alloys comprising less than 60% and more preferred less than 40% engineering thermoplastics, further remelting and mixing steps are required. Consequently, the steps then consist of making the compatibilizer, mixing solid compatibilizer with 60% or more engineering thermoplastics and 40% or less polyolefin and melt kneading to form solid alloy comprising 60% or more engineering thermoplastics. This solid alloy is then blended with polyolefin pellets or powder or flakes, fed to an extruder or alike, remelted and melt kneaded to form solid alloy comprising less than 60% engineering thermoplastic.<br>
Consequently, there is a need to provide for more efficient processes for producing compatibilized polymer blends which, among other things, save energy, are less costly,   enable   production   of   alloys   comprising   less   than   60%   engineering<br>

thermoplastic in at most two melt kneading steps and produce less degradation of the product through excessive reprocessing.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The term "self compatibilizer" refers herein to a modified polymer (a compatibilizer) derived from an unmodified polymer in which (1) a portion of the unmodified polymer is grafted or functionalized by a reactant containing, after grafting, at least one reactive group per molecule capable of reacting with another polymer that is incompatible with first unmodified polymer; and (2) the grafting or functionalizing takes place as part of the manufacturing process of a melt blending with at least one second polymer. The process may be coupled as well to the process of making the final, end-use product. In other words, a self-compatibilizer gains its reactive group during the manufacturing process.<br>
The term "external compatibilizer" refers herein to a modified polymer, copolymer, or terpolymer containing a reactive group that is provided to the manufacturing process and already contains the reactive group when provided. For example, the external compatibilizer may be commercially obtained or it may be formed in a parallel, but distinct, manufacturing process.<br>
The present disclosure provides a one-step process in which a self-compatibilizer is formed from a first polymer, melt kneaded with a molten second polymer, melt kneaded with optional additives, and then melt kneaded to form a compatibilized polymeric composition. The unmodified first and second polymers are incompatible and thus without the grafting stage, the result is a blend having poor physical properties. The compatibilized polymeric composition can then be directly provided to subsequent molding or extrusion steps from which a finished product may be obtained. The process takes place in a suitable continuous, progressive melt kneading apparatus, such as an extruder.<br>
In embodiments, the process comprises:<br>
-9-<br><br>
i)	providing a first thermoplastic polymer and a reactive moiety to an upstream<br>
portion of a first progressive melt kneading apparatus, the reactive moiety comprising a first reactive group reactive towards the first thermoplastic polymer but not with a second polymer which is subsequently provided and a second reactive group reactive with the second polymer but not with the first thermoplastic polymer;<br>
ii) melt kneading the first thermoplastic polymer and the reactive moiety so that the first reactive group reacts with at least one portion of the thermoplastic polymer and grafts the second reactive group to the first thermoplastic polymer, thereby forming a molten self-compatibilizer;<br>
iii) providing a molten second polymer to the first progressive melt kneading apparatus; and<br>
iv) melt kneading the molten self-compatibilizer with the molten second polymer at a downstream portion of the first progressive melt kneading apparatus so that the second reactive group reacts with at least one portion of the second polymer to form the compatibilized polymeric composition.<br>
The compatibilized polymeric composition is characterized by more than one discrete phases, wherein the first phase is continuous or semi-continuous and at least one other phase is dispersed in the first phase as nodules, lamellas, rod like domains, amorphous shape domains, and/or interpenetrating network structures. The reaction product between the self-compatibilizer and the second polymer stabilizes the dispersion in melt form and in solid form. Without the compatibilizer, the blend will tend to disintegrate and no practical usage may be obtained. Usually the average size of the dispersed phase in the compatibilized blend is smaller than the average size of the dispersed phase in the un-compatibilized blend.<br>
The first thermoplastic polymer may be an unmodified polyolefin, ethylene copolymer or ethylene terpolymer. The thermoplastic polymer can be selected from polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate, polypropylene, ethylene-alpha olefin elastomer, ethylene-propylene elastomer, ethylene-propylene diene elastomer, ethylene-acrylate ester or methacrylate ester copolymer or terpolymer, or any copolymer or combination thereof. The thermoplastic polymer may comprise a polyolefin, an ethylene copolymer, an ethylene terpolymer; ethylene-acrylic esters and ethylene-methacrylic esters; polystyrene; styrene copolymers and terpolymers; styrenic block copolymers; butyl rubber; acrylonitrile butadiene rubber; butadiene rubber; copolymers and terpolymers of butadiene; natural rubber; polyisoprene rubber; ethylene-propylene elastomers; polychloroprene; hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR); silicones; polysulfide polymers; vinyl polymers; or any copolymer or combination thereof. Combinations are also contemplated. Neoprene® is the DuPont Performance Elastomers trade name for a family of synthetic rubbers based on polychloroprene.<br>
In specific embodiments, the thermoplastic polymer comprises polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), polypropylene, ethylene-alpha olefin elastomer, ethylene-propylene elastomer, ethylene-propylene diene elastomer, or ethylene-acrylate ester or methacrylate ester copolymer or terpolymer.<br>
-10-<br><br>
Exemplary polyolefins suitable as the thermoplastic polymer include polyethylene commercially available as Attane™ and Dowlex™, manufactured by Dow, Petrothene™, manufactured by Equistar, Sabic™, manufactured by Sabic, Marlex™, manufactured by Chevron-Phillips, and Exceed™, manufactured by ExxonMobil; ethylene-alpha olefin elastomer commercially available as Engage™, manufactured by Dow, Exact™, manufactured by ExxonMobil and Tafmer™ and Evolue™, manufactured by Mitsui; or ethylene-propylene elastomer or ethylene-propylene diene elastomers commercially available as Vistalon™, manufactured by Exxon Mobil and Nordel™, manufactured by Dow; ethylene-acrylate ester or methacrylate ester copolymers and terpolymers commercially available as Elvaloy™, manufactured by DuPont, and Lotryl™, manufactured by Arkema; and butyl rubber, nitrite rubber, silicone elastomer, polyurethane elastomer, and styrene block copolymers commercially available as Kraton™, manufactured by Kraton, etc.<br>
The first thermoplastic polymer is melt kneaded with a reactive moiety that comprises a first reactive group reactive towards the first thermoplastic polymer but not with a second polymer and a second reactive group reactive with the second polymer but not with the first polymer. The first reactive group reacts with at least one portion of the first thermoplastic polymer, grafting the second reactive group onto the first thermoplastic polymer. The second reactive group compatibilizes the first thermoplastic polymer with the second polymer, such that covalent bonds are obtained between portions of the first and second polymers so they can be blended together into a composition having improved properties relative to an un-compatibilized blend. The improved properties include better elongation to break, toughness, strength, surface quality, gloss, and chemical resistance.<br>
Generally, the two reactive groups can be any reactive segment.

The second reactive group of the reactive moiety is grafted to the first thermoplastic polymer by reaction between the first reactive group and the first thermoplastic polymer. The reaction mechanism may be by free radical, anionic, or cationic initiated grafting. In specific embodiments, a reaction initiator, reaction catalyst, or reaction accelerator may be added to promote the grafting of the first reactive group onto the first thermoplastic polymer. Suitable initiators can be selected based upon the type of reaction intended. For example, where the grafting reaction is between a reactive moiety containing a carbon-carbon double bond and a polyolefin thermoplastic polymer, a free radical initiator may be suitable. As another example, where the reactive group is an oxirane group, a cationic initiator may be suitable.<br>
The second polymer is a polymer, preferably an engineering thermoplastic resin comprising a polyamide; polyester; polyurethane; or copolymers, block copolymers, blends or combinations thereof.

Aliphatic polyurethanes in particular have better resistance against UV light and thermal induced degradation. Commercially available polyurethanes include Pellethane™, manufactured by Dow; Estane™ and Tecothane™, manufactured by Noveon; and Desmopan™, manufactured by Bayer.<br>
In specific embodiments, the second reactive group of the reactive moiety is reactive with one or more groups on the second polymer. In particular, the second reactive group can form covalent bonds with groups on the second polymer. It should also be noted that the reactive moiety need not be completely grafted upon the first and second polymers. Covalent bonds can be formed between at least one portion of the first thermoplastic polymer and at least one portion of the second polymer to form a hybrid chain. The hybrid chain structure compatibilizes the other unmodified chains and enables the dispersion of two immiscible polymers. The mechanism is similar to the way a surfactant emulsifies oil and water.<br>

The term "barrier properties" refers to the ability of the particles to (1) reduce the rate of diffusion of additives from the polymeric composition into its surrounding environment; (2) reduce the rate of diffusion of hydrolyzing agents such as water, protons and hydroxyl ions from the surrounding environment into the polymeric composition; and/or (3) reduce the production / mobility of free radicals and/or ozone inside the polymeric composition. Nanoparticles are from about 5 to about 100 nanometers in average diameter. In specific embodiments, the nanosize particles comprise a material selected from the group consisting of clay; silica; silicates; alumosilicates; zinc oxide; titanium oxides; zirconium oxides; talc; nanotubes; metal particles and/ or flakes; carbon black; sulfides and sulfates; plant or animal originated cellulose, lignin, or proteins; and combinations thereof.<br>
Additional unmodified polymer may also be added in some embodiments.<br>
UV absorbers may be added. Organic UV absorbers include benzotriazoles or benzophenones commercially available as, for example, Tinuvin™, manufactured by Ciba, and Cyasorb™, manufactured by Cytec. Inorganic UV absorbers include particles made from materials such as titanium salts, titanium oxides, zinc oxides, zinc halides, and zinc salts, and in particular titanium dioxide.

A<br>
- 14-<br><br>
hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) is a molecule which provides long term protection against free radicals and light-initiated degradation. In particular, HALS does not contain phenolic groups.<br>
An external compatibilizer may also be added. Use of an external compatibilizer is not necessary, but may be useful in certain applications and/or in adjusting the properties of the compatibilized polymeric composition. It should be recognized that the self-compatibilizer may be similar to or even the same as various known materials which may be synthesized separately or commercially obtained. However, in those cases the materials would be referred to as an external compatibilizer. Thus, the self-compatibilizer and the external compatibilizer may both be referred to as a functionalized polymer or oligomer.<br>
In specific embodiments, the functionalized polymer or oligomer is selected from (i) modified polymers and (ii) copolymers and terpolymers. Modified polymers may have pendant first reactive groups and/or terminal first reactive groups, the first reactive groups being in a non limiting manner from carboxyl, anhydride, oxirane, amino, ester, oxazoline, isocyanate, and combinations thereof.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of functionalized polymers or oligomers include a maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene; a maleic anhydride grafted ethylene-acrylic or methacrylic ester copolymer or terpolymer; a maleic anhydride grafted propylene homopolymer or copolymer; a maleic anhydride grafted ethylene-alpha olefin polymer; a maleic anhydride grafted ethylene-propylene rubber; a glycidyl methacrylate or acrylate (GMA) grafted polyethylene; a GMA grafted ethylene-acrylic or methacrylic ester co-polymer or terpolymer; a GMA grafted propylene homopolymer or copolymer; a GMA grafted ethylene-alpha olefin polymer; a GMA grafted ethylene-propylene rubber; an acrylic or methacrylic acid grafted ethylene copolymer or terpolymer; an acrylic and methacrylic acid ionomer; a styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer or terpolymer; a styrene-acrylic acid or styrene-methacrylic acid copolymer or terpolymer; a copolymer or terpolymer of ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate or ethylene-glycidyl acrylate; and combinations thereof.<br>

-15-<br><br>
functional unsaturated monomer includes an unsaturated group and a first reactive group selected from carboxyl, anhydride, oxirane, amino, ester, oxazoline, isocyanate, and combinations thereof. For example, the copolymer may be styrene maleic anhydride copolymers and terpolymers, such as SMA™ resins, manufactured by Sartomer, UMG AXS™, manufactured by UMG, Synthacryl™, manufactured by UCB resins and others.<br>
The external compatibilizer can be a copolymer or terpolymer provided by gas phase, emulsion phase, liquid phase or solid phase polymerization, for example styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, or ethylene-acrylic acid ester-glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer. The external compatibilizer can be provided in any shape, such as solid pellets, powder, liquid, solution, flakes, or as melt from a melt kneading apparatus. The external compatibilizer may be the product of either reactive extrusion or a reactor.<br>
The various steps in the process of the present disclosure may be performed in several different manners. In one embodiment, the second polymer is provided to the first apparatus from a second apparatus directly into an aperture in the downstream portion of the first apparatus. The second apparatus may be an extruder. The second apparatus may also be a batch mixer. In another embodiment, a melt pump mediates the flow of polymer from the second apparatus to the first apparatus.<br>
In other embodiments, the additive(s) to the self compatibilizer and second polymer is provided directly to the first or second melt kneading apparatus from a feed port, an injection aperture or a coupled extruder.<br>
In one specific embodiment, a polyolefin and a reactive moiety are fed to a first extruder and melt kneaded to form a self-compatibilizer. A molten second polymer is provided from a second extruder, coupled to the first extruder directly or via a melt pump. The two polymers are melt kneaded together in the first extruder or in a third extruder. Volatile matter may be removed by means of a vent - at atmospheric pressure and/or under an applied vacuum. Optionally, roving, filler, short fibers, and/or long fibers are provided via an aperture in any of the extruders, usually close to the die. Filler and short fibers may be provided by means of a side feeder and roving may be provided from a spool Long fibers provide additional stiffness, strength, impact strength, and fatigue resistance to the compatibilized blend. Continuous long fibers provide the greatest stiffness, strength, impact strength, and fatigue resistance to the compatibilized blend. Other additives such as colorants, blowing agents, heat stabilizers and/or light stabilizers, processing aids, tougheners, and plasticizers may be introduced from any aperture in any of the melt kneading apparatuses (preferably extruders), in the form of pellets, powder, flakes, liquid, liquid or compressed gas, or slurry. In embodiments, the additive is provided in a molten state, a solid state, a liquid state, in a gaseous state, or in solution, emulsion, or dispersion in a suitable solvent.<br>

FIG. 1 shows the chemical reactions that occur as the processes of the embodiments of the present disclosure are carried out. An unmodified first thermoplastic polymer 10 is provided. Here, for simplicity, the first thermoplastic polymer is shown as comprising monomer A, though it may comprise other monomers. A reactive moiety 20 has two reactive groups R1 and R2 which are joined by divalent linkage B. When the first thermoplastic polymer 10 is melt kneaded with the reactive moiety 10, the first reactive group R1 reacts with at least a portion of the first polymer 10 to graft the second reactive group R2 to the first polymer 10. The reactive moiety 20 may be grafted as either a pendant group or a terminal group, as shown in self-compatibilizer 30. R1 becomes the covalent bond between monomer A and the reactive moiety. Note that divalent linkage B is considered a representative placeholder and does not have a specific constant chemical structure. For example, the reactive moiety may be maleic anhydride. Once reacted, the atoms and bonds represented by divalent linkage B differ from when they were in the anhydride form.<br>
The self-compatibilizer 30 is then melt kneaded with second polymer 40, which is shown here, for simplicity, as consisting of monomer C. Of course, the second polymer 40 may comprise other monomers. The second reactive group R2 reacts with at least a portion of second polymer 40 to graft the self compatibilizer 30 with the second polymer 40. The result is a compatibilized polymeric composition 50.<br>
FIG. 2 is a process flow diagram illustrating various embodiments of processes according to the present disclosure. A first thermoplastic polymer is provided. A reactive moiety is also provided, the reactive moiety comprising at least one first reactive group capable of reacting with the first thermoplastic polymer but not a second polymer which is to be subsequently provided and a second reactive group capable of reacting with the second polymer but not the first thermoplastic polymer. An initiator and or catalyst may also be provided if needed. These ingredients are combined in a melt kneading apparatus and melt kneaded to form a self-compatibilizer. They are melt kneaded for enough time so that the first reactive group reacts with the first polymer, usually between about 2 seconds and about 2 minutes. The second reactive group does not react with the first polymer. In some embodiments, no initiator is required because free radicals are generated due to shear melt in the melt kneading apparatus.<br>
Once the self-compatibilizer is formed, the process may vary depending on whether and when any additives are provided and added to the polymer mixture. Additives can be provided from a side feeder. If powder or short fibers are introduced, a forced feeder (usually a screw that pushes the additive towards the molten polymer) may be used or they may be fed gravimetrically. If the additive is a liquid, pressurized gas, solution, dispersion, or emulsion, high-pressure injection through a nozzle may be used.<br>
A molten second polymer is provided to the melt kneading apparatus and is melt kneaded together with the self-compatibilizer to form a compatibilized polymeric composition.  The grafted second reactive group reacts with the second polymer to<br>
-17-<br><br>
form hybrid chains that compatibilize the unmodified chains. In embodiments, the molten second polymer is provided from an extruder that is coupled to the first extruder. The two extruders may be directly coupled or the coupling may be done by a dedicated melt pump or accumulator. The second polymer may be an polyolefin, styrenic, silicone, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, polycarbonate, as well as a mixture, blend, or alloy of more than one polymer. In some embodiments, the second polymer comprises an engineering thermoplastic resin. An engineering thermoplastic resin is any polymer characterized by a tensile modulus of elasticity greater than 1.5 MPa and tensile strength greater than 25 MPa. The second polymer may also be melt kneaded by a batch apparatus and pumped to the first apparatus by means of an extruder or a melt pump. In any case, the second polymer is provided to the melt kneading apparatus in a molten state, and the process of forming the compatibilized polymeric composition proceeds to completion without intermediate cooling and remelting steps.<br>
In this way, the process of the present disclosure provides a compatibilized polymeric composition in a much more efficient and less costly process than has been heretofore possible. Products made from the compatibilized polymeric composition have less tendency to yellow and better toughness due to less thermal history compared to a multi-step process. Another advantage of the novel process is the ability to form compatibilized blends comprising heat sensitive polymers and additives, since the residence time of the second polymer and any additives is adjustable and may vary from a few minutes to only a few seconds. Another advantage is the ability to melt knead low fraction (lower than 45% by weight) of higher melting point polymer in lower melting polymer. This can not be obtained by current melt kneading technology, since the higher melting point polymer will not be molten if melt kneaded from dry blend with the lower melting point polymer.<br>
A preferred embodiment of high melting polymers is polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyamide 6 and 66 and polyphthalamide. A preferred embodiment of low melting polymers are polyethylene and copolymers and terpolymers of ethylene, polypropylene and styrenic polymers, copolymers and terpolymers such as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile (ABS).<br>
As shown by arrows (a), (b), and (c), the additives can be added prior to or simultaneously with the molten second polymer being combined with the self-compatibilizer. The additives may also be added after the self-compatibilizer and second polymer have been melt kneaded.<br>
The compatibilized polymeric composition can be further processed in at least three ways. As shown by arrow (d), the compatibilized polymeric composition may be provided to a direct extrusion process in which extruded products may be produced without intermediate cooling and remelting steps. For example, such products may include a tube, a pipe, a profile, a beam, a sheet, a film, a strand, a filament, etc, As shown by arrow (e), the compatibilized polymeric composition may be formed into and collected as an intermediate product, such as pellets, granules, flakes or powder,<br>
-18-<br><br>
for later use. As shown by arrow (f), the compatibilized polymeric composition may be provided to a direct molding process for produced molded articles. The molding process may include blow molding, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, sheet extrusion followed by compression molding, calendaring, or any other molding process known in the art.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic process flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process of the present disclosure. Here, the entire process is carried out in a single continuous, progressive melt kneading apparatus, although components may be fed from other apparatus. First, the unmodified first thermoplastic polymer and the reactive moiety are melt kneaded under conditions such that the reactive moiety is grafted onto the first thermoplastic polymer, forming a self-compatibilizer. In a downstream portion of the same melt kneading apparatus, at least one molten second polymer is fed into the melt kneading apparatus combined with the newly formed self-compatibilizer. The second polymer may be a rigid polymer such as an engineering thermoplastic (engineering thermoplastic) resin. The process further includes the addition of roving. The roving may comprise, e.g., long fibers of glass, carbon, aramid, metal, ceramic, natural (originated from plants or animals), or polymeric materials. These ingredients are wetted and melt kneaded to form a reinforced compatibilized polymeric composition.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic process flow diagram illustrating another exemplary process of the present disclosure. FIG. 3 differs from FIG. 2 in that instead of roving, the process includes the addition of short fibers such as glass fibers, ceramic fibers, natural fibers, aramid fibers, mineral fiber, metal fiber, and carbon fibers, with the mixture of self-compatibilizer and second polymer.<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic process flow diagram illustrating yet another exemplary process of the present disclosure. FIG. 4 differs from FIG. 2 in that the molten second polymer, optional ingredients, and roving are each provided as a product of another melt kneading apparatus. In particular, the roving may be combined with a suitable carrier, such as a polymer, solvent, dispersion, slurry, or other material which can be handled in a melt kneading apparatus.<br>
In embodiments, the continuous, progressive melt kneading apparatus is an extruder. The extruder may be a single-screw extruder or a multiple-screw extruder, and in specific embodiments is a twin-screw extruder. The melt kneading apparatus should provide shear adequate to result in thorough and complete mixing of the polymers and other additives provided to the apparatus. In other specific embodiments, the melt kneading apparatus applies force to the components of the composition such that the components are mixed, dispersed, distributed, melted, softened, heated, ground, or reduced in particle size. In additional embodiments, at least one melt kneading apparatus is a multi-screw extruder, internal mixer, or a co-kneader.<br>
-19-<br><br>
In specific embodiments, the polymeric compatibilized composition is melt kneaded in an apparatus having screws or shafts characterized by high distributive mixing. Exemplary screws or shafts which provide high distributive mixing are shown in FIGS. 6-15. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 6. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 7. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 8. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 9. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 10. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 11. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 12. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 13. In specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 14.1n specific embodiments, at least 5% of the screw length of at least one melt kneading apparatus uses the screw shown in FIG. 15. There are advantages to providing the second polymer in a molten state. If the second polymer is added as a solid, it is difficult to melt because most of the melting energy in melt kneaders is produced by friction between the solid second polymer and the shaft or barrel of the kneader. Thus, the second polymer does not evenly disperse in the blend, and in some cases it may remain in solid form. By providing the second polymer to the first melt kneading apparatus in molten form, this problem is overcome. Of course, other additives, such as fillers, fibers, and roving are solids and will remain as solids in the compatibilized polymeric composition. In some embodiments, the second polymer is provided to the first melt kneading apparatus from a second melt kneading apparatus. This increases efficiency because there is no need to remelt the second polymer or increase the residence time of the mixture.<br>
In some embodiments, all ingredients are provided to the first melt kneading apparatus in a molten form or dispersed in a molten polymer, where such ingredients are not susceptible to melting at the relevant temperatures at which the melt kneading apparatuses are operated.<br>
In specific embodiments, roving is added after the molten second polymer is mixed with the self-compatibilizer. This enables enough residence time and mixing to wet the fibers with minimal degradation of fiber length.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the compatibilized polymeric composition may be directly provided to a direct extrusion process or to a direct molding process or it may be collected as an intermediate product. In some embodiments, the polymeric composition is extruded from a die in the melt kneading apparatus to form one or more of pellets, granules, flakes or powder. When the polymeric composition is provided to a direct extrusion process or to a direct molding process, the molten polymeric composition is transferred directly as melt from the first melt kneading<br>
-20-<br><br>
apparatus to the extrusion or molding apparatus or tool. In particular embodiments, the polymeric composition is transferred in a molten state, without an intermediate step of first converting it into a solid state. Thus, there is no need to first cool and solidify the product and then to remelt it later. The direct extrusion process may be used to form a profile, a tube, a pipe, a sheet, a film, a strand or a filament, or any other extruded product of the compatibilized polymeric composition. When the polymeric composition contains roving, the extrusion process may be in the form of a pultrusion or a pushtrusion process, wherein the roving is involved directly in the extrusion. The roving may remain intact along the entire extruded article or be cut to a pre-defined size by the kneader or die. In further embodiments where the polymeric composition is provided to a direct molding process, a final molded product is obtained from the molding process and the process may include a step of blow molding, injection molding, transfer molding, compression molding, low-pressure injection molding, injection-compression molding, or sheet extrusion followed by compression molding. The direct molding process may be used to form any shape.<br>
Several products may be formed using the processes of the present disclosure. Such products include a reinforcing membrane, tendons, ligaments, strips, bars, lumbers, beams, decking, concrete reinforcing elements, soil reinforcing elements geomembrane, geo-grid, cellular confinement system (CCS), sport goods, bicycles and motorcycles, medical devices, printed circuit boards, telecommunication packaging devices, pipes, valves, fuel systems, hazardous materials packaging and transportation, textiles, composite materials and structures, military lightweight structural elements, ballistic elements, automotive parts, and structural parts.<br>

resulting product, referred to hereinafter as CB.2, was extruded as a strip 1.5 mm thick and 100 mm wide.<br>
EVALUATION<br>
Tensile strength, modulus and creep modulus were measured 1 week after extrusion (referred to hereinafter as T.0) and after exposure for 60 days, in an aqueous solution having pH = 6 at 45°C (referred to hereinafter as T.60). Surface gloss and chalking were measured after 10,000 hours in QUV (QUV/Spray method, UVA-340 Lamp).<br>
Two strips, each 100 mm width, were welded by ultrasonic sonotrode at 20 MHz. Ultimate weld strength was measured 48 hours after welding, and is referred to hereinafter as UWS.<br>
A pair of strips of 100 mm length each were welded (weld width 100 mm), and ten welded couples were loaded by an 88 Kg load for a period of 30 days. The percentage of welded couples surviving intact is referred to hereinafter as %WCS88.<br>
The resistance against organic fluids was evaluated by immersion for 60 days in Diesel fuel, and calculating the resultant weight gain. The results are summarized in TABLE 1.<br><br>

The mixture was fed into the main hopper of a first co-rotating twin screw extruder having a length tP diameter ratio (L/D) of 48 at a rate of 60 kg/hr. A first side aperture was located halfway down the length of the extruder (where the L/D is about 24) and a second cc&gt;-rotating twin screw extruder having L/D of 16 was mounted to the first side aperture;. Both extruders were operated at 50-200 RPM  screw speed. The first extrader was operated at 180-220◦C AT the first half and 265-290 at the second half, and the second extruder was operated at 265-290°C.<br>
30 kg of shredded Polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) leverage bottles (the PET was pre-dried to 0.01% humidity content prior to extrusion) resin was provided at a rate of 20 kg/hr and melt kneaded first in the second extruder. The molten PET resin was then fed to the first extruder and melt kneaded with the functionalized polyethylene resin provided from the first sector of the first extruder. The melt kneading occurred along about 6-12 L/D downstream from the first side aperture (the entrance point of the molten PET resin). At about 36-45 L/D from the main hopper of the first extruder, a second side aperture was provided and equipped with a side feeder, powder dozing unit, and atmospheric vent. 15 kg mixture of Talc Iotalk Superfine™, manufactured by Yokal, 550 grams of Tinuvin™ 111 HALS mixture, and 550 grams of Tinuvin™ 234 low volatility benzotriazole UV absorber, both manufactured by Ciba, were fed together from the side feeder at a rate of about 16 kg/hr and melt kneaded with the compatibilized fiend in the last portion of the first extruder. A vacuum vent along the last quarter of the first extruder was used to remove volatile byproducts. The resulting compound was extruded through a die, pelletized by a strand pelletizer, and dried at 45°C.<br>
