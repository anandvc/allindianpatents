				<td>Introduction<br>
The present invention relates to an improved stable pharmaceutical composition . The pharmaceutical composition containing enantiomers , salts of the enantiomers of omeprazole such as esomeprazole. The present invention particularly relates to an improved pharmaceutical composition in the form of hard gelatin capsules containing enantiomers, salts of the enantiomers of omeprazole such as esomeprazole which is useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers and a process for its preparation. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention guarantees the integrity of the composition until it reaches the proximal part of the small intestine, where the composition will be disaggregated to facilitate the absorption of the enantiomers, sahs of the enantiomers of omeprazole such as esomeprazole contained therein. This invention also involves a process of preparing the above mentioned pharmaceutical composition ( hard capsules)<br>
The present invention provides a stable pharmaceutical composition containing enantiomers, salts of the enantiomers of omeprazole such as esomeprazole, in the form of hard gelatin capsules useful for treating gastro intestinal ulcers. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is in the form of hard gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. The composition of the present invention would dissolve in the intestine to facilitate absorption in the neutral / alkali environment.<br>
Prior art of the invention<br>
Benzimidazolic compounds such as omeprazole (5-methoxy-2(((4-methoxy-3, 5-di met hyl -2-pyridinyl)-methyl-sulfinyl)lH-benzimidazole), lansoprazole (2-((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2"trifluoro etoxy) -2-piridyl)methyl (sulfmyl IH-benzimidazole) (U.S. Pat No. 4,628,098), pantoprazole (U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,579)), and rabeprazole, are anti-ulcerous substances known for decreasing gastric acid secretion (Olbe L., et al., Gastroenterol., 83:193-198 (1982); Saton H. et al., Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 40 (suppl), 226 (1986); Saton H, et al., J.Pharmacol. Exp. Ther, 248 (2), 806-815 (1989), These compounds are used in the therapeutics of diseases related to gastric acidity in<br><br>
mammals and especially in humans, including gastric and duodenal ulcers, reflux oesophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis.<br>
It is also known that these substituted benzimidazoles possess a very low level of solubility in water. They solubilize easily in alkaline solutions. They degrade quickly in acidic and neutral media (Pilbrand and Cederberg, Scand. J. Gastroenterol, 20 (Suppl. 108), p. 113-120 (1985)) and they are stabilized in the presence of alkaline reacting compounds.<br>
The maximum stability of omeprazole solution is reached at pH 11 [Drug. Dev. Ind. Pharm., 21(8), 965 (1995)]. Degradation occurs very quickly below a pH of 7.0. On the other hand, it is necessary that the formulations dissolve quickly in the intestine, where the benzimidazolic compounds should be absorbed, i.e. when the pH becomes higher than 6.8.<br>
There are various prior art information showing benzimidazoles such as omeprazole and its enantioner such as esomeprazole with the above activity.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,505 proposes the mixture of a mass of cellulose derivatives and disaggregants, with an appropriate amount of omeprazole and alkaline agents or alkaline salts of the drug, in order to obtain, by extrusion, a core which is spheronized and coated with gastroresistant agents dissolved in alcoholic solutions also containing considerable percentages of acetone. However, the pellets obtained may be extremely irregular in shape and dimensions, and this can have repercussions on a relative dispersion of the average weight of the capsules and of the respective dosage.<br>
The US Patent no 6,248,355, describes a composition of omeprazole without the use of alkaline- reacting compounds and in which the active ingredient is granulated together and compressed together along with inert ingredients followed by a coating of intermediate coat containing one or several inert water soluble layer or layers which rapidly disintegrate in aqueous medium and contains non-acid inert pharma excipients. This layer comprises at least one polymer conventionally used in application where a<br><br>
film is provided by coating with such materials as sugars, polyethyleneglycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, an intermediate coat, and an enteric coating containing entero- soluble gastro resistants made of latex suspension of polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, methacrylic acid, methacrylic esters, methacrylic acid copolymers.<br>
This process involves multi-step processing such as preparation of core, intermediate layer and enteric coatings and may involve a number of controlling points like dry mixing of the drug with inert excipients, granulation of the mass, lubrication, compression, followed by a coating of intermediate layer and finally coating by an enteric layer, thereby making the process a muhi-step process with each step subjected to the active ingredient analysis thereby not only making the process cumbersome but also increasing the cost of the product.<br>
The US Patent no 5,714,504 provides methods for the preparation of pure crystalline enantiomeric sahs of omeprazole which is having a dosage strength of equivalent 20 mg base and eqivalent 40 mg base in the form of oral delayed release tablets or granules.<br>
The US patent no 5,877,192 describes a method for the treatment of gastric acid related diseases and production of medication using enantiomer of omeprazole by a method of inhibiting gastric acid secretion comprising the oral administration of a pharmaceutical compositions which is having a dosage strength of equivalent 20 mg base and equivalent 40 mg base in the form of oral delayed release tablets or granules.<br>
The US Patent no 6,132,770 provide a tableted multiple unit effervescent dosage form comprising esomeprazole or an alkaline salt of esomeprazole, in which the active substance is in the form of enteric coating layered units compressed together with effervescent tablet excipients into such an effervescent tablet.<br>
The US Patent no 6,132,771 describes a preparation comprise a gastric acid suppressing agent, such as a proton pump inhibitor selected from esomeprazole , in<br><br>
combination with one or more prokinetic agents such as mosapride, cisapride in a new fixed unit dosage form, especially a tablet.<br>
The US Patent no 6,136,344 discloses a preparations which comprise an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor, esomeprazole magnesium salt in combination with one or more antibacterial compounds in a new fixed unit dosage form, especially a tableted dosage form.<br>
The US Patent no 6,183,776 provides oral, fixed unit dosage forms, i.e. multiple unit tableted dosage forms, layered formulations comprising an enteric coating layered tablet core, multilayered tablets or a sachet filled with pharmaceutically active compound selected from S-omeprazole magnesium salts.<br>
The US Patent no 6,328,993 discloses an oral administration form such as tablet, an effervescent, tablet, powder in a sachet, a coated tablet or a capsule made of a proton pump inhibitor selected from the group consisting of pantoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprozole.<br>
The US Patent no 6,365,184 provides oral adminstration such as fixed unit dosage forms, i.e. muhiple unit tableted dosage forms, enteric coating layered tablets, multilayered tablets or capsules filled with pharmaceutically active compound such as esomeprazole magnesium salt, lansoprazole, pantoprazole.<br>
The US Patent no 6,428,810 discloses a oral pharmaceutical formulation with a core comprising active pharmaceutical ingredients selected from omeprazole or enantiomers of omeprazole, a separating layer and an enteric layer. The dosage forms are pellets filled in hard gelatin capsules or tablets.<br>
The US Patent 6,489,346 provides a solid pharmaceutical composition in a dosage form that is not enteric-coated having active ingredients selected from omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, pariprazole and leminoprazole<br><br>
or an enantiomer such as esomeprazole and at least one buffering agent for treating gastrointestinal disorder. Due to the absence of enteric coating, the stability of the drug may not be optimum.<br>
In our co-pending Indian application no 388 MAS 03 and the corresponding PCT application no PCT/IN03/00179 we have disclosed a process for the production of hard gelatin capsules in a conventional manner comprise an inert core, constituted by starch and sugar, surrounded by active core containing at least one substituted benzimidazole in the micronized form which is mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable non-alkaline and inert excipients followed by intermediate coating and an enteric coating, in order to gurantee the integrity of the product until it reaches the proximal part of the small intestine where the formulation will be disaggregated to facilitate the absorption of the substituted benzimidazole compound.<br>
The said invention has been developed based on our finding as a result of sustained R &amp; D work, that the incorporation of benzimidazole derivatives, particularly useful for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, without the necessity of using an alkali agent or alkali salt of the substituted benzimidazole for the stability of the formulation.<br>
Such a composition will have an advantage over the existing form of the formulation as the available dosage forms for benzimidazole derivatives are having the total amount of active ingredient in the form of solid particles engulfed in a solid matrix of excipients preferably hydrophilic substances, further coated with protective and gastric resistant enteric polymer coatings. It may take some time to dissolve these coats before the benzimidazole derivative is dissolved into the surronding intestinal fluid and gets absorbed.<br>
Our continued research in the above directions resuhed in our surprised and unexpected finding that when esomeprazole, is used as the benzimidazole derivatives, the resulting composition  has also  found to have  extended periods of<br><br>
stability during which period the composition does not get discolored and / or degraded.<br>
None of the above said prior art discloses and / or envisages such a composition and therefore the composition of the present invention is unique and novel.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides, composition containing enantiomers, salts of the enantiomers of omeprazole such as esomeprazole, and a method of making the said composition that are not taught or suggested by the prior art Considering the importance gained for the composition containing benzimidazole derivatives, particularly omeprazole, more particularly esomeprazole and other enentiomers of omeprazole or its salts , for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, there is a need for the development of pharmaceutical composition containing said derivatives having stability for an extended period during which period the composition does not get discoloured and / or degraded.<br>
