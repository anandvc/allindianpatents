This invention relates to/blow room textile cleaning machine having grid oscillating means. In cotton spinning mills, the blow room houses machinery for breaking bales of cotton which opens up and blends highly compressed cotton fibres taken from different bales. Dust, broken leaf and mote get released during this step and are extracted or separated therefrom. Compressed cotton that leaves the bale breaking machine is subjected to preliminary beating to fully open them up. High speed spiked cylinders are conventionally used to beat out sand, dust, broken leaf and the like leaving the cotton in a fluffy state.<br>
Both finer and coarser cotton varieties are cleaned in the first cleaning machine known in the art as LBC 1. Cotton with high trash and dust content is effectively cleaned by this machine without causing much damage to the fibre content thereof. The device for removing dust and trash consists of a set of grid bars provided under the beater roller over which the fiber tufts are made to pass. The sharp edges of the grid bars point towards the beater and are preferably triangular or rectangular in shape. These sharp edges of the grid bars hit the fibre tufts during its passage through the beater rollers to loosen them and to release the dust and extraneous matter embedded therein. The dust particles thus released fall down through the space provided in between the grid bars to the base of the cleaning chamber. Means are provided for removing the dust that gets accumulated during cleaning operations.<br><br>
One of the draw backs of this device is that at least a part of the dust and other extraneous matter released from tufts of cotton gets deposited on the edges of the grid bars. It is noticed that micro dust particles show a tendency to get lodged or accumulated on the grid rollers. As the opening up and cleaning operations proceed a thick layer of micro dust is formed on the grid surface. On continuation of the cleaning process, the deposited micro dust particles get carried away with the fibre tufts that pass through the grid rollers, making the cleaning ineffective. This drastically affects the quality of the cotton tufts. Periodical cleaning of the grid bars to remove micro dust and other foreign body deposit therefrom is essential to overcome this problem.<br>
We have observed that if the grid assembly is subjected to periodic oscillation, the dust and foreign body deposits thereon get released, thereby avoiding contamination of the cotton tufts. The released dust particles fall down on the base of the machine and can be removed therefrom by conventional modes. After each grid oscillation, a cleaner grid surface is exposed to the incoming cotton.<br>
Grill assembly is arranged on grid rollers and are mounted on the front and rear side frames of the cleaning machine. Conventionally two grid holders are provided one on either side of  the  assembly.  These grid holders are  connected  with  each<br><br>
other by neans of two tie bars. The entire grid assembly is mounted on the machine frame with the help of studs and sliding bushes.<br>
Oscillating means for oscillating the grid assembly described above may be cam actuated mechanism, crank and lever actuated mechanism or electromagnetically actuated mechanism. Our invention is directed to textile cleaning machine with grid assembly having any of the above described actuating means for oscillating the grid assembly.<br>
According to this invention, the blowroom textile cleaning machine having grid oscillating means comprises a plurality of grid bars provided beneath the beater roller of the said cleaning machine, the said grid bars constituting grid assemblies mounted on the front and rear side of the frame of the said machine, the said grid assemblies being provided with grid oscillating means for imparting oscillatory movement to the grid bars.<br>
We shall now describe the three different embodiments of the oscillating means in detail.<br>
l. Cam. actuated mechanism far gxid. oscillation:<br>
In  this  embodiment, the oscillation movement of  the  grid assembly  is  effected with a cam actuated means.  At  least  two<br><br>
cans are provided in either side of the grid assembly and are fixed to a common cam shaft. The cams are drivable by conventional gear motor having chain and sprocket arrangement. The cams are connected to the grid assembly through roller followers, sliding bushes and studs that hold the grid assembly means for reversing the grid assembly is also provided in this embodiment. This is carried out with coil springs fixed on the rear side of the machine. These springs are mounted inside a spring holder provided with spring guides welded within. The spring is supported on one end by a spring support fixed at the stud projecting from the sliding bush.<br>
This  embodiment will now be described with reference to  figures<br>
1, 2 and 3 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
The grid assembly is arranged on two grid hoiaers (23). Two tie bars (6) interconnect the grid holders. Reference numerals 18 and 19 represent the front and the rear frames of the textile cleaning machine in which the grid assembly is mounted. Numerals 4 and 7 show the stud and sliding bush which hold the grid assembly. Cams are shown by numeral 10 and the cam shaft by numeral 11. Roller follower which connects the cam to the grid assembly is shown by numeral 12. The brackets on which the cam shaft is mounted is shown by reference numeral 5 which the motor to  drive  the  cam  is shown by 8 and  the  chain  and  sprocket<br><br>
arrangement by 9. When the motor is driven, its drive is transmitted through the shaft and the cam assembly to oscillate the grid assembly connected therewith.<br>
Coil springs (21) mounted inside spring holder (1) is supported on the spring support member (3) fixed on the stud projecting from the sliding bush 4. This arrangement reverses the grid assembly when desired.<br>
Crank and. lever actuated mechanism for grid, oscillation<br>
Crank wheel supported on a casting bracket is fixed on the front frame of the textile cleaning machine. One end of a first lever is connected to the crank wheel, the other end of which is hingedly connected to one end of a second lever. The other end of this second lever is slidably mounted inside a swivel housing. The swivel housing is in turn connected hingedly to the sliding stud. The second lever is hingedly connected in the middle to the front frame of the grid assembly. As the crank rotates, the levers swing and the second lever slides inside the swivel housing to transmit its horizontal movement to the sliding stud which in turn imparts oscillating motion to the grid assembly.<br>
It is also possible to eliminate the first lever and to provide a slot on the second lever which transmits the motion of the crank to the frame.<br><br>
This embodiment will now be described with reference to figures 4 and 5 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Numeral 26 indicates the crank wheel which is supported on a bracket (25) fixed on the front frame (19). The first lever is shown by reference numeral (27) and the second lever by numeral (29). Reference numeral(34) shows the hinged connection of the first and the second lever, while numeral 32 shows the hinged support of the second lever fixed to the frame 19. Numeral 30 represents the swivel housing hinged to the sliding stud (7). Sliding bush is indicated by reference numeral (4).<br>
In an alternate embodiment shown in figure 5, the first lever (27) is eliminated but a groove or a slot 35 is provided on the second lever 29.<br>
Electromagnetically actuated grid, oscillation<br>
In this embodiment, the grid assembly is oscillated by means actuated electromagnetically. Current carrying coils are fixed on the front and rear side frames of the textile cleaning machine and the sliding studs fixed on the sides of the grid assembly acts as plungers. Bushes are provided within which the plungers slide. When electrically energised, the plunger is attracted to the coil due to electromagnetism and oscillatory motion is achieved by switching on power alternately between the coils located on both the frames.<br><br>
In an alternate embodiment tension springs are provided on one side of the frame while the other side has current carrying coils. The tension springs are mounted on spring supports. When the coils on one side are energised the plunger is attracted to the coil against the spring force and when de-energised the plunger goes to its initial position. When this cycle is repeated, an oscillatory motion is imparted to the grid assembly.<br>
The above embodiments will be described with reference to figures 6 and 7 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
The current carrying coil is shown by numeral 40, the sliding stud by numeral 7; the front and rear frames by 18 and 19. Bush is indicated by reference numeral 4.<br>
In figure 7, numeral 41 shows the tension springs provided on one side of the frame. While reference numeral 1 stands for the spring support.<br>
Eventhough the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to preferred embodiments, it is intended to cover variations and adaptations falling within the scope of its general principles.<br><br><br>
