COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br><br><br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a communication control apparatus and a communication method which are suitable for use with a short-distance wireless communication network comprising at least a communication control apparatus and host equipment, and in more detail, relates to a communication control apparatus, host equipment thereof, and a communication method for carrying out transmit-receiving of data between the host equipment and the network server through the short-distance wireless communication network.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, development has been carried out, in the wireless LAN (Local Area Network) system, about the system which employs a Bluetooth system which uses an electric wave of 2.4 GHz. band to effect processing in conformity of a frequency hopping system to carry out transmit-receiving of data between pieces of equipment.<br>
The above-described Bluetooth svstem has been developed jointly by enterprisers in various business fields of computers, electric communications, networking, and so on using the wireless communication technology, and is the<br><br><br>
system for realizing the ad hoc wireless (RF) networking between a plurality of personal computers and devices. The Bluetooth system has been planned by enterprisers such as Inter, Erikson, IBM, Nokia, and Toshiba (registered trademark) who have participated in Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group). According to the Bluetooth system, a notebook, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) or a portable telephone co-owns information and various services with a personal computer through wireless communication, not requiring troublesome cable connection.<br>
The Bluetooth system is designed for ad hoc short-distance connection, and the communicable range is within 10 m as a standard. In the Bluetooth system, the ad hoc multipoint connection is carried out to construct "Piconet" whose maximum number of connections is eight (8) and communication range is 10 m, co-owning the band width of 1 Mbps. In the Bluetooth system, when synchronous communication is carried out, the transfer speed of 432.6 Kbps is realized for both up communication and down communication, capable of realizing the speed about ten times of normal analog connection according to 56K MODEM. On the other hand, in the Bluetooth system, communication at higher speed is enabled in non-synchronous communication, and the speed of down communication is 721 Kbps and that of up communication is 57.6 Kbps. Further, in the Bluetooth system, the voice communication is supported also, and three synchronous voice channels (transfer speed: 64 Kbps) at maximum can be set simultaneously. Further, the simultaneous transfer of voice and data can be realized by a single channel which provides 64 Kbps<br><br>
                                                          . synchronous voice link and non-synchronous data link. Such a Bluetooth system can be utilized in a variety of platforms, and in addition, the wireless communication can be realized at low cost.<br>
According to the Bluetooth system as described above, an intelligent mechanism owned by a PC base software can be realized by every electronic equipment. However, for putting the Bluetooth system to practical use, it is necessary to make a transceiver component smaller in size and lower in price, and to be able to incorporate the system into today"s note-type personal computers, PDA, portable telephones, and portable head sets, etc. Further, since portable type equipment normally uses a battery, it is necessary to save the power consumption.<br>
For solving the problems noted above, the Bluetooth system employs a system for designing all logics and transceiver hardware compactly. The transceiver hardware uses radio frequency having a 2.4 GHz band that can be used without permission, and further employs a spread system by way of frequency hopping in order to prevent wiretapping and interference. This frequency hopping carries out hopping 1600 times every second on 79 channels (2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz) divided every 1 MHz. Further, the Bluetooth system enciphers data, and limits a device capable of getting access by password authentication, in order to enhance the security of data transmission.<br>

In the wireless LAN system 1100 as described above, host equipment used by an individual user include various pieces of equipment in addition to the personal<br><br>
computer 1102, the digital camera 1103, and the portable telephone 1104. These pieces of equipment include a variety of equipment such as home terminals such as a TV set, a stereo system, a set top box and so on, in addition to those described above. Even the same kind, the host equipment are sometimes used under the various environments according to the using mode of the users, for example, such as a personal computer used in their offices, and a personal computer used in their home.<br>
Recently, there are, as the host equipment as described above, those enabling connection with the Internet network through a public telephone network such as PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), etc., and a mobile communication network making use of PDC (Personal Digital Cellular), PHS (Personal Handyphone System), etc. The host equipment provides users network applications using data described in e-mail and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) making use of SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and POP (Post Office Protocol).<br>
Under present conditions, in the wireless LAN system, when a user makes use of a plurality of host equipment, the environment setting of a network application of each host equipment is independent every host equipment.<br>
For example, in cases where a specific user owns a plurality of host equipment storing therein an e-mail application as a network application, it has been necessary to separately set, in individual host equipment, communication setting necessary for receiving an e-mail service provided by an e-mail server, application setting, a list of<br><br>
                                                                                                                                        address information, and information related to an individual user such as transmit-receive past record.<br>
Further, under present conditions, when a WWW application is contemplated as a network application, even in case that the WWW application service provided by the WWW server from each host equipment is utilized by the same user, information of a book mark of URL is unavoidably dispersed every host equipment.<br>
Even in cases where in each host equipment, the same user uses the same network application, the fact that the application setting of each host equipment cannot be handled jointly between the host equipment is a great burden on the user in terms of setting and using.<br>

The terminal ability information memory section 93 stores terminal ability information in connection with a function of the host CPU 92, contents of which is controlled by the host CPU 92 and read. The terminal ability information stored in the terminal ability information memory section 93 include information in connection with a display mechanism of the host equipment 4, information in connection with an operation input mechanism including letter input means such as a button and a keyboard, and information in connection with a protocol stack and an application program stored in a memory internally of the host CPU 92.<br>
This interface section 91 comprises an interface capable of carrying out transmit-receiving of a packet to and from the interface section 64 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 A and B.<br>
The host CPU 92 produces a packet including data produced by the host equipment 4 and a command based on the operation input signal produced by being operated by a user. This host CPU 92 executes processing in an application layer to produce data, command, and response to command. This host CPU 92 executes processing in a HOSTI/F layer to produce a packet, which is output to the wireless communication apparatus 3 through the interface section 91.<br><br><br>
Here, the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 are in a master/slave relationship, in which the host equipment 4 is a master, and the wireless communication apparatus 3 is a slave. Namely, the wireless communication apparatus 3 is operated in accordance with the packet or the like from the host CPU 92. For example, even when data is output from the wireless communication apparatus 3 to the host equipment 4, the wireless communication apparatus 3 is able to output data to the host equipment 4 only when a packet to the effect that the using right of the sel data line connecting with the host equipment 4 is obtained is input from the host CPU 92.<br>
More concretely, when data is transmit-received between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 3, this is accomplished by outputting a packet of a predetermined packet format to the wireless communication CPU 70 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 in a predetermined time interval from the host equipment 4.<br>
Namely, the host CPU 92 of the host equipment 4 produces, when data is transmitted to the wireless communication apparatus 3, a packet having control data indicative of "OUT token packet" as the PID data to output it to the wireless communication CPU 70. Further, the host CPU 92 produces, when it is able to receive data from the wireless communication apparatus 3, a packet having control data indicative of "IN token packet" as the ID data to output it to the wireless communication CPU 70. Thereby, the packet including data can be input-output<br><br>
between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4.<br>
Further, the host CPU 92 produces a packet in which contents of PID data is changed according to control contents of the wireless communication apparatus 3 to output it, whereby controlling an operation mode of the wireless communication apparatus. Namely, the host CPU 92 outputs the packet to the wireless communication apparatus 3 to switch the wireless communication apparatus 3 to a communication idle mode, a memory mode, an OUT transaction mode, and an IN transaction mode.<br>
The wireless communication CPU 70 carries out initialization processing in accordance with the fact that a signal to the effect that mounted on the host equipment 4 is input from the interface section 64. The wireless communication CPU 70 carries out individual authentication processing relative to the host equipment 4 in order to confirm utilizing authority of the wireless communication apparatus 3 of a user operating the host equipment 4, and processing for inputting terminal ability information from the host equipment 4. The details of the individual authentication processing and terminal ability information will be described later.<br>
Further, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits, when it carries out inputting of terminal ability information, a command packet to the host equipment 4 so as to input terminal ability information from the terminal ability information memory section 93 of the host equipment 4. Then, the wireless communication CPU 70 receives a response packet corresponding to a command packet to cause the<br><br>
terminal ability setting memory section 65 to store terminal ability information included in the response packet.<br>
Furthermore, the wireless communication CPU 70 carries out initialization processing, setting processing of network setting information stored in the network setting memory section 68 relative to the host equipment 4, setting processing of individual information stored in the individual information memory section 67, connection and disconnection processing relative to an e-mail server included in the public communication network 40, preparing processing for message data included in an e-mail, and transmission and obtaining processing for an e-mail. At this time, the issues a command for controlling the host equipment 4, and interprets the response to the command from the host equipment 4 to thereby carry out various processing.<br>
In the following, the packet construction of a packet to be input-output between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 will be described with reference to FIG. 9 and FIG. 10 A, B.<br>
When the processing as described above is carried out between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4, the host equipment 4 carries out processing for producing a command packet 100, as shown in FIG. 9. On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 carries out processing for producing a response packet 110 with respect to the command packet 100. The command packet 100 and the response packet 110 are, when a plurality of pieces of<br><br>
host equipment are present within the short-distance wireless communication network 30, in the form of packet construction used in common between the pieces of host equipment.<br>
For example, the wireless communication apparatus 3 is controlled by the host equipment 4 as shown in FIG. 9, the command packet 100 is output from the host equipment 4 to the wireless communication apparatus 3. The wireless communication CPU 70 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 is caused to include a result having network application control processing carried out in the response command 110 to output it to the host equipment 4.<br>
The CPU 92 of the host equipment 4 issues a command and a command parameter 102 for controlling the wireless communication apparatus 3 included in the command packet 100. The interface section 91 of the host equipment 4 prepares the command packet 100 including the command and the command parameter issued by the host CPU 92 to output it to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
The command packet 100 comprises packet construction in which a command type 101a, a command name 101b, and a parameter 102 are arranged in order from the head, as shown in FIG. 10 A.<br>
The command type 101a is, for example, an AT command, and stores, when the command name 101b and the parameter 102 are described, information indicative of being described in the AT command type.<br>
In   the   command   name   101b,   commands   selected   by   the   wireless<br><br>

The response packet 110 has construction in which a processing result 111, and a parameter 112 are arranged in that order from the head, as shown in FIG. 10 B.<br>
The processing result 111 is a result obtained by processing a command packet 100. In a region of the processing result 111, OK or NO is described.<br>
In parameters 102 and 112 of the command packet 100 and the response packet 110, respectively, parameter classes 102a and 112a indicative of information to be an objet of the command or the processing result, and parameter contents 102b and 112b indicative of contents of parameter classes 102a and 112a are arranged in that order.<br><br>
When address information of a transmission destination of mails contained in individual information is set, individual information are stored in the parameter classes 102a and 112a, an address information of an e-mail transmission destination are stored in the parameter classes 102b and 112b.<br>
In the packets shown in FIG. 10 A and FIG. 10 B, processing of an application level not depending on the classes of the host equipment 4 is prepared by the interface section 64 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the interface section 91 of the host equipment 4. By the employment of such a packet constitution as described, the wireless communication apparatus 3 can be used in common between a plurality of host equipment. Thereby, in the wireless LAN system 1, communication of the command/response system can be carried out, irrespective of a kind of host equipment 4, between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3, and between the host equipment 4 through the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
In the following, description will be made, with reference to FIG. 11, of the processing procedure of initialization processing when the wireless communication apparatus 3 is mounted on the host equipment 4, in the wireless LAN system 1 constituted as described above.<br>
According to FIG. 11, first, in Step ST 1, in the host equipment 4, the insertion of the wireless communication apparatus is detected by the interface section 91. The interface section 91 then outputs a signal to the effect that the wireless communication<br>
■a<br>
apparatus is mounted to the host CPU 92. In response thereto, the host CPU 92 urges<br><br>
a user to input an individual authentication password indicative of utilizing authority of the wireless communication apparatus 3. The host CPU 92 carries out presentation to the effect that for example, an individual authentication password is input in a display mechanism loaded. Thereby, in response to the fact that a user, for example, uses an operation input mechanism to input an individual authentication password, the host CPU 92 issues a command of a password authentication n request (AUTH) to the effect that authentication processing of an individual authentication password is carried out, and issues a password input by the user as a command parameter. Then, the interface section 91 outputs a command packet CI containing a command and a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, in the wireless communication apparatus 3 into which the packet command CI is input, a command and a command parameter are input into the wireless communication CPU 70 from the interface section 64. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 2, the command to compare an individual authentication password stored in the command parameter with an individual authentication password stored in the individual authentication password memory section 66. Thereby, the wireless communication CPU 70 authenticates utilizing authority of the use who operates the host equipment 4, and outputs a response packet Rl having OK stored in the processing result to the host equipment 4. Thereby, the authentication processing between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 ends.<br><br><br>
In the individual authentication password memory section 66 is stored a temporary individual authentication password at the time of production, and in cases where the user who operates the host equipment 4 is changed, it is necessary to carry out individual authentication processing using a temporary individual authentication parameter stored in advance. Thereby, a new individual authentication password is stored in the individual authentication password memory section 66. The processing for changing the individual authentication password is the same processing as that when network setting information described later is set using "SETPWD" as the command name in the above-described Table 1.<br>
The host equipment 4 informs the wireless communication apparatus 3 of terminal ability information based on the function of the host equipment 4 after the individual authentication processing has been completed. At this time, the host CPU 92 issues a command (SETTC) to the effect that terminal ability information is set to the wireless communication apparatus 3 to make terminal ability information stored in the terminal ability information memory section 93 a command parameter. The interface section 91 then outputs a command packet C2 (1) containing a command and a command parameter 102 to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, in the wireless communication apparatus 3 into which the command packet C2 (1) is input, a command and a command parameter are input into the wireless communication CPU 70 from the interface section 64. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 3, the command, and<br><br>
stores terminal ability information stored in the command parameter in a memory region corresponding to the terminal ability setting memory section 65. The wireless communication CPU 70 then outputs a response packet R2 (1) having OK stored in the processing result to the host equipment 4.<br>
When a plurality of command parameters indicative of terminal ability are present, and it is necessary to input-output the command packet C2 and the response packet R2 plural times between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3, the host equipment 4 outputs, after Step ST 4, the command packets C2 (1), C2 (2),... sequentially to the wireless communication apparatus 3 to set terminal ability information.<br>
Thereby, in the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4, the individual authentication processing and the terminal ability setting processing are ended, and the initialization processing is ended to assume an initialization processing completed state.<br>
According to the wireless LAN system 1 for carrying out the individual authentication processing as described above, when the wireless communication apparatus 3, in which for example, information in connection with money and information in connection with individual privacy are stored as individual information and network setting information, is lost or stolen, the apparatus 3 is not allowed to be used. In cases where the individual authentication password contained in the command packet CI is not coincided with the individual authentication password<br><br>
stored in the individual authentication password stored in the individual authentication password memory section 66, the wireless communication apparatus 3 rejects accessing of the individual information memory section 67 and the network setting memory section 68 to output the response packet Rl containing NG in the processing result 111 to the host equipment 4, thereby preventing use thereof by others.<br>
Further, according to the wireless LAN system 1 for carrying out the terminal ability setting processing, processing adapted to the terminal ability of the host equipment 4 can be carried out on the wireless communication apparatus 3 side. The wireless communication apparatus 3 obtains, for example, a protocol mounted on the host equipment 4 as terminal ability information from the host equipment 4, whereby configuration of a network application protocol started internally can be carried out. Further, the wireless communication apparatus 3 is able to carry out processing such as changing of a method for obtaining an e-mail according to a kind of host equipment.<br>
Next, description will be made, with reference to FIG. 12, of the processing procedure of processing for setting network setting information stored in the network setting memory section 68 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 in the wireless LAN system 1 constituted as described above.<br>
Setting processing of network setting information by the host equipment 4 is carried out in the aforementioned initialization completed state. According to FIG.<br><br>
12, first, the host CPU 92 of the host equipment 4 issues, with a network setting information setting request (SETNET) to the effect that setting processing for network setting information is carried out as a command, a parameter class and a parameter content to be an object as a command parameter. The interface section 91 outputs a command packet C 11 (1) containing a command and a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, in the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C 11 (1) input, a command and a command parameter (102) are input into the wireless communication CPU 70 from the interface section 64. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 11, a command, and stores parameter classes and parameter contents indicative of various irtformation contained in network setting information stored in the command parameter 102 in the network setting memory section 68. The wireless communication CPU 70 outputs a response packet R 11 (1) having OK stored in the processing result 111 to the host equipment 4.<br>
Here, when a plurality of information contained in the network setting information need be set, a plurality of command parameters are issued, and the command packet Cll and the response packet R11 are input and output plural times between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3. The wireless communication apparatus 3 carries out, in Step ST 12 and Step ST 13, setting processing for network setting information as the host equipment 4 sequentially<br><br>
outputs command packets C 11 (1), C 11 (2), ... to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
When network setting information is already stored in the network setting memory section 68, and besides when network setting information of the same parameter class is further input, network setting information input into the same region of the network setting memory section 68 is overwritten.<br>
Further, information contained in the network setting information include information concerning money matters such as mail user ID, and information relating to privacy of a user. Accordingly, when processing for setting network setting information is carried out, the wireless communication CPU 70 does not store network setting information input from the host equipment 4 as text data as it is in the network setting memory section 68, but enciphers the network setting information to store it in the network setting memory section 68. Then, the wireless communication CPU 70, when uses the enciphered and stored network setting information, uses it after being decoded.<br>
While description has been made of one example in which the network setting information is input from the host equipment 4 into the wireless communication apparatus 3 whereby the information is set to the network setting memory section 68 as described above, it is to be noted that for example, even information fixedly used with respect to the network application protocol like a telephone number of an access point used connected to an internet service provider, with respect to information<br><br>
which is possibly changed every time the user uses, the individual information memory section 67 may be utilized to carry out setting processing for the network setting information.<br>
Namely, for example, information indicative of a list of telephone numbers of the access point is stored in the individual information memory section 67, and processing shown in FIG. 13 described later is carried out whereby a list of access points is displayed on the display mechanism of the host equipment 4, and a command packet containing a command parameter having telephone numbers selected by the user stored therein is input into the wireless communication apparatus 3 from the host equipment 4 to store it in the network setting memory section 68. Thereby, the setting processing for network setting information stored in the network setting memory section 68 is carried out whereby the setting inputting which is necessary to be carried out any time can be simplified.<br>
Next, description will be made, with reference to FIG. 13, of the processing procedure of processing for obtaining, setting, and deleting individual information stored in the individual information memory section 67 relative to the wireless communication apparatus 3 from the host equipment 4, in the wireless LAN system 1 constituted as described above.<br>
First, processing for obtaining individual information in the host equipment 4 will be described. The processing for obtaining individual information by the host equipment 4 is carried out in the above-described initialization completed state.<br><br>
According to FIG. 13, first, in Step ST 21, an operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 not shown is operated by the user, and in response thereto, the host CPU 92 inputs an operation input signal to the effect that as information, for example, address list information (address book) indicative of a list of address information of equipment for transmitting an e-mail is displaced. In response thereto, the host CPU 92 issues, as a command, an individual information obtaining request (GETPINFO) to the effect that obtains individual information. The host CPU 92 issues a command parameter with address list information to be an object for the obtaining processing as a parameter class. Then, the interface section 91 outputs a command packet C21 containing a command and a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C21 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the interface section 64 into the wireless communication CPU 70. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 22, the command to read address list information shown by the parameter class stored in the command parameter from the memory region of the individual information memory section 67. The wireless communication apparatus 3 issues OK as a processing result, issues address list information as a response parameter, and outputs a response packet R21 from the interface section 64 to the host equipment 4.<br>
Thereby, the host equipment 4 obtains address list information from the<br><br>
wireless communication apparatus 3, and displays a list of addresses on the display mechanism.<br>
Next, processing for setting individual information stored in the individual information memory section 67 will be described. In the processing for setting individual information, first, in Step ST 23, when the operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is operated by the user, the host CPU 92 inputs an operation input signal to the effect that address list information indicative of a list of address information of equipment for transmitting an e-mail is set as individual information. In response thereto, the host CPU 92 issues a command storing therein an individual information setting request (SETPINFO) to the effect that individual information is set, and issues a command parameter with parameter contents as setting contents, with an address list to be an object for setting processing and address numbers as parameter classes. Then, the interface section 91 outputs a command packet C22 containing a command and a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C22 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the interface section 64 to the wireless communication CPU 70. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 24, the command and the command parameter, and stores in the individual information memory section 67 information indicative of parameter contents as individual information in the memory<br><br>
region storing therein address list information indicative of parameter classes stored in the command parameter. The wireless communication CPU 70 issues OK as a processing result, and outputs a response packet R 22 from the interface section 64 to the host equipment 4.<br>
When a plurality of individual information to be set are present, a command packet C 5 and a response packet R 5 are input and output plural times between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, processing for changing individual information stored in the individual information memory section 67 will be described. In the processing for changing individual information, first, in Step ST 25, the operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is operated by the user, and in response thereto, the host CPU 92 inputs an operation input signal to the effect that address list information is changed. In response thereto, the host CPU 9 issues, as a command, an individual information setting request (SETPINFO) to the effect that individual information is set. Further, the host CPU 92 issues a command parameter with contents as parameter contents, with an address list to be an object for change processing and address numbers as parameter classes. The interface section 91 then outputs a command packet C22 containing a command and a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
In response thereto, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C 22 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the<br><br>
interface section 64 to the wireless communication CPU 70. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 26, the command and the command parameter 102 superscribes information indicative of setting contents as individual information on the individual information memory section 67 to achieve changing, in the memory region having address list information indicative of parameter classes stored in the command parameter. The wireless communication CPU 70 issues OK as a processing result, and outputs a response packet R 22 from the interface section 64 to the host equipment 4.<br>
When a plurality of individual information to be changed are present, a command packet C 5 and a response packet R 22 are input and output plural times between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, processing for deleting individual information stored in the individual information memory section 67 will be described. In the processing for deleting individual information, first, in Step ST 27, the operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is operated by the user, and in response thereto, the host CPU 92 inputs an operation input signal to the effect that address list information is deleted. In response thereto, the host CPU 9 issues, as a command, an individual information setting request (DELPINFO) to the effect that individual information is deleted. Further, the host CPU 92 issues a command parameter with an address list to be an object for deleting processing and address numbers as parameter classes. The interface section 91 then outputs a command packet C23 containing a command and<br><br>
a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C 23 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the interface section 64 to the wireless communication CPU 70. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 28, the command and the command parameter deletes individual information storing therein an address list and address numbers indicative of parameter classes stored in the command parameter. The wireless communication CPU 70 issues OK as a processing result, and outputs a response packet R 23 from the interface section 64 to the host equipment 4.<br>
When a plurality of individual information to be deleted are present, a command packet C 23 and a response packet R 23 are input and output plural times between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, processing for connecting and processing for disconnecting between the host equipment 4 and the public communication network 40 through the wireless communication apparatus 3 will be described with reference to FIG. 14. In description referring to FIG. 14, the processing procedure will be described where a network server is an e-mail server 53.<br>
The processing for connecting the host equipment 4 and the e-mail sever 53 is carried out in the initialization completed state described above. According to FIG. 14, first, the host CPU 92 issues a command storing therein a server connection request (CONSV) to the effect that connection with the e-mail server 53 is requested,<br><br>
and issue a class of the e-mail server 53 as a command parameter. The class of the e-mail server 53 is a network application protocol to which various servers such as SMTP, POP, and IMAP can correspond. The interface section 91 outputs a command packet C31 containing a command to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C31 input inputs a command from the interface section 64 to the wireless communication CPU 70. The wireless communication CPU 70 discriminates, in Step ST 31, server classes stored as command parameters. Thereby, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets the e-mail server 53 connected with a network application protocol to which the e-mail server 53 can correspond as a discriminator.<br>
Then, in Step ST 32, the wireless communication CPU 70 reads network setting information which is necessary according to a network application protocol stored as a command parameter from the network setting memory section 68, and starts a network application protocol stored in ROM 71. Subsequently, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a command packet SI containing a connection connecting request for requesting connection with the e-mail server 53 to a provider 50 through a portable telephone 2, a mobile communication network 20, and a publica communication network 40. The wireless communication CPU 70 reads address information of the e-mail server 53 requesting connection, and information indicative of a port designated from the network setting memory section 68 to transmit them<br><br><br>
including the command packet S1. On the other hand, a response packet S2 indicative of connection enablement (OK) with the e-mail server 53 requesting connection is transmitted from the provider 50, and in response thereto, the connection is established to end the server connecting processing.<br>
In the next Step ST 33, the wireless communication CPU 70 judges whether or not the user authentication processing is executed. At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 judges, when the connected e-mail server 53 corresponds to POP or IMAP, that the user authentication processing is executed. The procedure proceeds to Step ST 34, and when not corresponding to POP or IMAP, the user authentication processing is not executed.<br>
In Step ST 34, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits, first, as user authentication processing, a mail user ID stored in the network setting memory section 62, and a command packet 3 containing a mail user password. On the other hand, authentication processing is conducted by the e-mail server 53. and a response packet S4 indicative of connection permission is received, and in response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 ends the user authentication processing, and the procedure proceeds to next processing.<br>
In a case where the e-mail server 53 corresponds to POP 3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3), the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a mail user ID and a mail user password stored in the network setting memory section 68 by USER, PASS or APOP command. On the other hand, the wireless communication CPU 70<br><br>
ends the user authentication processing, in response to the authentication processing done by the authentication server 52 and the receipt of a response to a packet S4 indicative of connection permission (+OK), and the procedure proceeds to next processing.<br>
In a case where the e-mail server 53 corresponds to IMAP 4 (Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4), authentication is conducted by the authentication server 52 by a LOGIN command. On the other hand, the wireless communication CPU 70 ends the user authentication processing, in response to the authentication processing done by the authentication server 52 and the receipt of a response to a packet S4 indicative of connection permission, and the procedure proceeds to next processing.<br>
After assuming the state that enables access to the e-mail server 53 as a result of the user authentication processing as described above, the wireless communication CPU 70 outputs a response packet 31 relative to a command packet C31 including a server connection request to the host equipment 4.<br>
Thereby, the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3 assume a server connection state to enable the transmit-receiving of data between the host equipment 4 and the e-mail sever 53 through the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, the server disconnecting processing for releasing the connection state between the host equipment 4 and the e-mail server 53 will be described.<br>
First, the host CPU 92 issues a command for storing a server disconnecting<br><br>
request (DISCSV) to the effect the disconnection from the e-mail server 53 is requested, and issues a class of the e-mail sever 53 as a command parameter. The interface section 91 outputs a command packet C31 containing a command and a command parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, in Step ST 35, the wireless communication CPU 70 carries out the server disconnecting processing relative to the e-mail server 53. At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a command packet S5 containing a command (QUIT) for requesting disconnection, and receives a response packet S6 containing a response (221) for permitting it. Then, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a command packet S 7 indicative of a connection disconnecting request designating a port to end the server disconnecting processing.

On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C41 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the interface section 64 to the wireless communication  CPU 70. The wireless<br><br>
communication CPU 70 carries out processing that interprets, in Step ST 50, the command to construct message data within the RAM 69. The wireless communication CPU 70 stores the contents with respect to the data class (Cc) stored in the command parameter in a predetermined memory area of the Ram 69. Then, the interface section 64 outputs a response packet R41 with OK as the processed result to the host equipment 4.<br>
Thereby, the wireless communication CPU 70 prepares the header part including the Subject destination, the To destination, and the Cc destination.<br>
In next Step ST 51, in the host equipment 4, an operation input command to the effect that file data is attached to message data is input into the host CPU 92. In response thereto, the host CPU 92 issues a message data preparing request to the interface section 91. Then the interface section 91prepares a command packet C41 including a command parameter with the message data preparing request with a command name, with a file name as a parameter class, and with file data corresponding to the parameter kind as parameter contents to output it to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C41 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the interface section 64 to the wireless communication CPU 70. The wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 52, the command to carry out encode processing for file data in accordance with the MIME system to convert the file into,<br><br>
for example, text data.<br>
In next step ST 53, the wireless communication CPU 70 stores the text data obtained by the encode processing in a predetermined memory region of RAM 69 to carry out processing for constructing message data to which text data is attached within RAM 69. The interface section 64 outputs a response packet R41 with OK as a processing result to the host equipment 4.<br>
The host equipment 4 inputs into the wireless communication apparatus 3 a message data preparing request C41 as a command name and a single or a plurality of information elements as a command parameter. The wireless communication CPU 70 prepares message data having the information elements as shown in FIG. 15 described within RAM 69.<br>
Concretely, the wireless communication CPU 70 carries out processing for adding information elements designated as a command parameter to the corresponding header part and the body part and obtaining and adding information for describing the From line, and the Sender line designated by a command parameter from the network setting memory section 68; and processing for adding signature information stored in the individual information memory section 67 to the end of the mail body.<br>
Further, when the attached file is allowed to be contained in the message data, the wireless communication CPU 70 carries out processing in accordance with the MIME type for encoded text data or encoded data in response to the fact that data of<br><br>
the binary tope not encoded is input from the host equipment 4, to enable preparing message data containing multimedia data such as an image or a voice. Namely, the wireless communication CPU 70 carries out, as shown in FIG. 16, processing for adding information for describing Content-Type line for designating Content-Type:, boundary for clearly showing a part described in text data in the body part 240 and parts having file data of files and designating a kind of parts, and carries out processing for arranging text data and encoded file data.<br>
It is noted that the wireless communication CPU 70 does not carry out processing for describing Date line described in the header parts 210 and 230 depending on the message data preparing request, but adds it after construction of message data other than the Date line has been completed and after the mail transmission request (SNDML) has been input.<br>
By carrying out the aforementioned processing, the wireless communication CPU 70 prepares file data as the body part, and prepares message data comprising the header part and the body part.<br>
According to the wireless LAN system 1 provided with the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 for carrying out the processing as described above, for example, when message data of the Internet mail type is prepared, even in a case where a character input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is scarce, typical sentence infonnation and address list information stored in the individual information memory section 67 can be used to prepare message data<br><br>
including text data.<br>
Further, according to the wireless communication LAN system 1, since the encode processing in accordance with the MIME type can be carried out by the wireless communication CPU 70, for example, message data having attached file data of the binary type like an image taken by the host equipment 4 such as a digital camera can be prepared.<br>
Next, description will be made of, with reference to FIG. 18, the processing procedure of the host equipment 4, the wireless communication apparatus 3, and the provider 50 when an e-mail containing the message data constructed as described above is transmitted to the e-mail server 53 of the provider 50.<br>
Transmission of an e-mail to the e-mail server 53 of the provider 50 presupposes completion of the processing for connecting the host equipment 4 and the e-mail server 53 described above with reference to FIG. 14, and the server connection state of the host equipment 4, the wireless communication apparatus 3, and the provider 50. Further, transmission of an e-mail to the e-mail server 53 presupposes the processing described above with reference to FIG. 17, and the construction of message data within RAM 69.<br>
According to FIG. 18, first, in Step ST 61, an operation input mechanism of the host equipment not shown is operated by the user, in response to which the host CPU 92 starts mail transmission processing to issue a mail transmission request to the effect that an e-mail is transmitted. The interface section 91 prepares a command<br><br>
packet C 51 with a mail transmission request (SNDML) as a command name, with a data class (Date:) as a parameter class, and with a content of data class as a parameter content to output it to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
On the other hand, the wireless communication apparatus 3 having the command packet C 61 input inputs a command and a command parameter from the interface section 64 to the wireless communication CPU 70. In response thereto, the wireless communication CPU 70 interprets, in Step ST 62, the command to carry out processing for adding Date line to message data stored in RAM 69. The host CPU 92 prepares a command packet C 41 including a command parameter with a message data preparing request as a command name, with a data class (Date) as a parameter class, and with a content corresponding to the parameter class as a parameter content to output it to the wireless communication apparatus 3 thereby constructing message data having Date line added within RAM 69.<br>
In next Step ST 63, the wireless communication CPU 70 uses the message data stored in the RAM 69 to carry out processing in accordance with SMTP thereby preparing Internet mail data in which message data such as predetermined header information is added and indicating an e-mail. And, the wireless communication apparatus 3 transmits an e-mail to an access point 51 of the provider 50 through the short-distance wireless communication network 30, the mobile communication network 20, and the public communication network 40, and shifts to mail transmission processing with respect to the provider 50 in Step ST 64.<br><br><br>
In Step ST 64, the wireless communication apparatus 3 carries out processing in accordance with SMTP between the provider 50 and the e-mail server 53. The SMTP carries out communication by exchange between a command (Command) from the wireless communication apparatus 3 and a reply (Reply) on the provider 50 side. The wireless CPU 70 controls a base band control section 63 and a wireless control section 51 to transmit command packet from an antenna section 62 and receive a response packet with respect to command packet.<br>
Namely, first, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a HELO command packet S 11 indicative of a declaration for starting use of a communication line connected to the provider 50 to the provider 50. At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits the HELO command packet S 11 with a domain name as local host. On the other hand, the provider 50 sends as a reply a response packet S 12 including a processing result (code 250: SUCCESS) to the effect that the HELO command packet S 11 is accepted to enable communication in accordance with SMTP.<br>
Subsequently, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a MAILFROM command packet S 13 for notifying the provider 50 of a transmitter name (From:). At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a MAILFROM command packet S13 including a mail address of FROM line stored in a network setting information memory section 68. On the other hand, the provider 50 transmits a response packet S 14 including a processing result (code 250: SUCCESS) to the<br><br>
effect that the MAILFROM command packet S13 was accepted to the wireless communication apparatus 3. Here, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits the MAILFROM command packet S 13 including, as a mail address, a user name, a sub-domain name, a domain name, an organization ID, and a country ID.<br>
Next, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a RCPT command packet S13 to the provider 50. At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a MAILFROM command packet S13 including a mail address of the host equipment 4. On the other hand, the provider 50 transmits a response packet S 14 including a processing result (code 250: SUCCESS) to the effect that the MAILFROM command packet S13 was accepted to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a RCPT TO command packet S 15 for notifying the provider 50 of a destination (To:) contained, for example, in an Internet network 40a. At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a RCPT TO command packet S15 including a mail address of equipment at a destination. On the other hand, the provider 50 transmits, as a reply, a response packet S 16 including a processing result (code 250: SUCCESS) to the effect that the RCPT TO command packet S15 was accepted to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Next, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a DATA command packet S17 for notifying the fact that transmission of message data (DATA) starts to the provider 50. On the other hand, the provider 50 transmits a response packet S 18<br><br>
including a processing result (code 250: SUCCESS) to the effect that the DATA command packet S17 was accepted to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
The wireless communication CPU 70 carries out processing for reading, in response to the acceptance of the response packet S 18, Internet mail data including message data from the RAM 69 to transmit it to the provider 50. Here, the wireless communication CPU 70 controls so as to transmit a packet S 19 including message data in unit of one line. The wireless communication CPU 70 transmits the packet S 19 over plural times, and when transmitting all data included in the message data, transmits, in response to the completion of transmission of the mail body contained in the e-mail, CR/LF. CR/LF (CR: return, LF: open a new line), and receives a response packet S 21 including a processing result (code 250: SUCCESS) from the provider 50 that responded thereto.<br>
Next, in Step ST 65, the wireless communication CPU 70 carries out processing fpr deleting message data stored in the RAM 69 in response to the acceptance of the response packet S21. The wireless communication CPU 70 then outputs a response packet R 51 indicative of a mail transmission response indicative of completion of transmission of an e-mail to the e-mail server 53 to the host equipment 4.<br>
In the wireless communication system 1 provided with the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 for carrying out such processing as described above, when an e-mail is transmitted to the e-mail server 53, SMTP is<br><br>
started as a network application protocol stored in the wireless communication apparatus 3 to enable mail transmission processing between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the e-mail server 53.<br>
Description will be made hereinafter, with reference to FIG. 19, of the processing procedure of the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 when a mail list showing a list of e-mails that can be received by the host equipment from the e-mail server 53 on which are mounted network application protocols such as POP, and IMAP for receiving an e-mail.<br>
The processing for obtaining an e-mail is conducted in the initialization completed state as described above. According to FIG. 19, first, in Step ST 71, the host CPU 92 inputs an operation input signal for obtaining a mail list in response to the fact that an operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is operated by the user. In response thereto, the host CPU 92 transmits a command packet C31 including a server connection request as a command name as described in FIG. 14 to the wireless communication apparatus 3 to carry out, in Step ST 72, server connection processing between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the provider 50, user authentication processing, if necessary.<br>
The wireless communication CPU 70 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 outputs, in response to the completion of the server connection processing and the user authentication processing in Step ST 72, outputs a response packet R 31 including the server connection response to the server connection request to the host<br><br>
equipment 4.<br>
Next, the host equipment 4 transmits, in response to the fact that the response packet R31 is input, a command packet C61 including a mail list obtaining request as a command name to the wireless communication apparatus 3 to start mail list obtaining processing between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the provider 50 in Step ST 73.<br>
In Step ST 73, first, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits a command packet S31 including a UID list request for requesting a mail list comprising unique ID (UID) to the provider 50. Here, the wireless communication CPU 70 starts POP 3 as a network application protocol to transmit a UIDL command when a mail list is obtained, and starts IMAP 4 to transmit a uid undeletede command when a mail list is obtained.<br>
On the other hand, the provider 50 obtains a mail list comprising unique ID stored in the e-mail server 53 to transmit it as a response packet S 32 to the wireless communication apparatus 3. At this time, the provider 50 obtains a mail list comprising a row of unique Ids from a mail box of the e-mail server 53.<br>
In next Step ST 73a, the wireless communication CPU 70 obtains a mail list contained in a response packet S32, and reads the unique ID stored in the individual information memory section 67. The wireless communication CPU 70 compares the unique ID contained in the mail list from the e-mail server 53 with the unique ID contained in the individual information  memory  section  67.     The wireless<br><br><br>
communication CPU 70 judges, when a decision is made that the unique ID contained in the mail list is present in the individual information memory section 67, an e-mail of the unique ID as a read mail, and judges, when a decision is made that the unique ID contained in the mail list is not present in the individual information memory section 67, an e-mail of the unique ID as an unread mail.<br>
Further, in Step ST 73a, the wireless communication CPU 70 reads, when terminal ability information stored in a terminal ability information memory section 93 of the hot equipment 4 is stored in a terminal setting memory section 6, the terminal ability information, to classify and obtain the unique ID contained in the mail list every host equipment. And, the wireless communication CPU 70 compares the unique ID of an e-mail obtained by the host equipment 4 with the unique ID contained in the mail list to judge the read mail or unread mail.<br>
Next, the wireless communication CPU 70 transmits to the provider 50 a command packet S33 containing, as a parameter, a mail number corresponding to the unique ID, with an unread mail header obtaining request for obtaining information contained in the header part of an e-mail of the unique ID judged as an unread mail in Step ST 73a. The wireless communication CPU 70 transmits, when obtaining information contained in the header part of the unread mail by POP3, a TOP command, and transmits a FETCH command when IMAP 4 is started to obtain a mail list.<br>
The provider 50 with respect to the command packet S33 obtains an unread<br><br>
mail header obtaining request contained in a command name and a mail number with respect to the unique ID contained in a parameter. The provider 50 obtains a header part of an unread mail of the mail number obtained from the e-mail server 53 to transmit a response packet S 34 including a header part of the unread mail to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Thereafter, the wireless communication CPU 70 repeats processing for transmitting a command packet S33 in which a mail number contained in a parameter is changed to obtain a response packet S34 thereby obtaining header parts of all unread mails.<br>
In next Step ST 73b, the wireless communication CPU 70 uses information contained in header parts of a plurality of unread mails obtained in the above-described processing to carry out processing for preparing an unread mail list. First, the wireless communication CPU 70 analyses information contained in the header part of the unread mail to classify it into information elements contained in the header part such as FROM;, Subject:, Cc:, and Date: and contents of various information elements. Next, the wireless communication CPU 70 adds a mail number to the unread mail, and prepares a response packet R61 with a mail number of an unread mail and a content contained in the header part of the unread mail as a parameter to output it to the host equipment 4.<br>
In next Step ST 74, the host equipment 4 removes an unread mail list from the response packet R61 to display a mail number, a unique ID, and an unread mail list<br><br>
having information contained inn the header part on the display mechanism.<br>
The wireless communication system 1 provided with the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 for carrying out the processing as described starts, when a mail list is obtained by the host equipment 4, POP or IMAP as a network application protocol stored in the wireless communication apparatus 3 to carry out communication between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the provider 50 to enable carrying out the mail list obtaining processing.<br>
At this time, the wireless communication apparatus 3 uses the unique ID of the read e-mail stored as individual information to judge whether the e-mail that can be obtained by the host equipment 4 contained in the obtained mail list is unread or read to prepare an unread mail list according to the host equipment to enable outputting it to the host equipment 4.<br>
Further, according to the wireless LAN system 1, terminal ability information is stored in the terminal ability memory section 65 in advance from the host equipment 4 whereby a type or a kind of the host equipment 4, and an unread mail list can be classified and prepared according to an application program stored in the host equipment 4.<br>
Next, description will be made, with reference to FIG. 20, of the processing procedure of the host equipment 4, the wireless communication apparatus 3, and the provider 50 when the e-mail selected from the mail list obtained by the processing<br><br><br>
described with reference to FIG. 19.<br>
Obtaining the e-mail selected from the mail list presupposes the completion of processing for connecting the host equipment 4 and the e-mail server 53 described with reference to FIG. 14, and the server connection state of the host equipment 4, the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the provider 50.<br>
According to FIG. 20, first, in Step ST 81, a host CPU 92 of the host equipment 4 inputs, in response to the fact that the operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is operated by the user, an operation input signal to the effect that the mail list obtained by the processing described with reference to FIG. 19 is displayed to display it on the display mechanisms.<br>
In next Step ST 82, the host CPU 92 of the host equipment 4 inputs, in response to the fact that the operation input mechanism of the host equipment 4 is operated by the user, an operation input signal to the effect that the e-mail received from the mail list being displayed is selected. In response thereto, the host CPU 92 transmits a command packet C 71 containing a mail obtaining request as a command name and a mail number as a parameter to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
A wireless communication CPU 70 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 starts, in response to the command parameter C71, mail obtaining processing in Step ST 83. The wireless communication CPU 70 transmits, in the mail obtaining processing, first, to the provider 50 a command packet S 41 containing a mail obtaining request for requesting down-loading the e-mail stored in the e-mail server<br><br><br>
53. Here, the wireless communication CPU 70 starts POP3 as a network application protocol to transmit a RETR command containing a mail number as a parameter when an e-mail is obtained, while it starts IMAP4 to transmit a FETCH command containing a mail number as a parameter when an e-mail is obtained.<br>
In response to the command packet S 41, the provider 50 obtains an e-mail of a mail number contained as a parameter from the e-mail server 53 to transmit a response packet S 42 containing an Internet mail data to the wireless communication apparatus 3. Here, the Internet mail data transmitted from the provider 50 to the wireless communication apparatus 3 is normally described in a text type, and the e-mail describing type is an Internet mail type as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16.<br>
In response to the response packet S 42, the wireless communication CPU 70 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 divides the response packet S 41 into information for describing the header part and information for describing the body part. The wireless communication CPU 70 prepares a parameter every information for describing the header part obtained by the division, and information for describing the body part to prepare a response packet R71 to output it to the host equipment 4. At this time, the wireless communication CPU 70 outputs to the host equipment 4 the response packet R 71 containing a parameter with a mail number, FROM;, Subject:, Cc:, Date:, and the mail body as a parameter class, and with a content of each parameter class as a parameter content.<br>
In Next Step ST 84, the host CPU 92 displays, in response to the input of the<br><br>
response packet R 71, a mail screen on which the header part and the body part are described as shown in FIG. 15 or 16 on the display mechanism.<br>
In Next Step ST 85, the host CPU 92 carries out the processing similar to that of the aforementioned Step ST 82 to transmit the command packet C71 to the wigless communication apparatus 3.<br>
In response to the command packet C 71, the wireless communication CPU 70, in Step ST 86, transmits a command packet S 51 containing a mail obtaining request between the former and the provider 50 to the provider 50, and receives a response packet S 52 containing message data according to the command packet S 51. When the message data contained in the response packet S 52 is described in the MIME type, the wireless communication CPU 70 shifts to Step ST 86a.<br>
In Step ST 86a, the wireless communication CPU 70 converts, reversely, for example, to the processing for encoding data from the host equipment 4 in the MIME system and transmitting it, data described in the MIME system into a signal type that can be displayed by the host equipment 4.<br>

In Next Step ST 87, the host CPU 92 displays, in response to the input of the response packet R 71, a mail screen on which the header part and the body part as described as shown in FIG. 15 or 16 is displayed on the display mechanism. At this time, the host CPU 92 displays those other than data of an attached file as characters, and displays images shown by data of the attached file.<br>
The wireless communication system 1 provided with the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4 for carrying out the processing as described starts, when a mail list is obtained by the host equipment 4, POP or IMAP as a network application protocol stored in the wireless communication apparatus 3 to carry out communication between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the provider 50 to enable carrying out the mail obtaining processing.<br>
The wireless LAN system 1 not only carries out the processing for transmit-receiving the e-mail between the e-mail server 53 and the host equipment 4, but also is able to receive information stored in the WWW server by the host equipment 4.<br>
In the wireless communication apparatus 3, it is necessary to store HTTP as a network application protocol in ROM 71, to store a book mark indicative of hysteresis of URL as individual information, and to store address information of the proxy<br><br>
server as network setting information.<br>
The host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3 are provided with an interface for issuing a command and a response for obtaining information stored in the WWW server. The host equipment 4 designates URL for designating information stored in the WWW server as a parameter of a command packet when information stored in the WWW server is obtained. Further, in the wireless communication apparatus 3 are contained a parameter class for displaying data on the host equipment 4 as a response and data.<br>
As described above, according to the wireless LAN system 1 which applies the present invention, since a network application protocol is mounted on the wireless communication apparatus 3, it is not necessary to mount a network application protocol within the host equipment 4 when communication is conducted between the public communication network 40 and the host equipment 4. Further, according to the wireless LAN system 1, it is possible to establish a connecting relationship between the host equipment 4 not provided with a network application protocol and the public communication network 40.<br>
Furthermore, according to the wireless LAN system 1, not only setting information in connection with a network protocol in the wireless communication apparatus 3, but also setting information in connection with a network application are fixedly stored in the net work setting memory section 68 for use internally of the wireless communication apparatus 3. Therefore, it is not necessary to carry out setting<br><br>
in connection with a network application protocol every host equipment 4. Accordingly, in the wireless LAN system 1, it is possible to lighten the burden of the user for carrying out setting in connection with a network application protocol.<br>
Moreover, according to the wireless LAN system 1, by the packet constitution of the type as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 A, B, a command packet and a response packet can be input and output between the host equipment 4 and the wireless communication apparatus 3, and therefore, even the host equipment 4 of any class, the wireless communication apparatus 3 is mounted whereby a connection relationship between the host equipment 4 and the public communication network 40 is established to enable conduction of communication in accordance with a network application protocol.<br>
Further, according to the wireless LAN system 1, since individual information used when a network application protocol is executed is uniformly controlled internally of the wireless communication apparatus 3, even if individual information is set by a different type of host equipment, unified individual information can be prepared, and network application environment unified between pieces of host equipment 4 can be provided by using the unified individual information.<br>
Moreover, according to the wireless LAN system 1, even in cases where the wireless communication apparatus 3 is mounted on the host equipment 4 different in setting from the unified individual information, it can be used in the network application environment using the unified individual information. Namely, even the<br><br><br>
host equipment 4 storing therein individual information of others, the individual information stored in the wireless communication apparatus 3 is used whereby it can be used as own host equipment 4 instantly.<br>
Furthermore, interface means capable of input-outputting the packet constituted as shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10 A, B described above is provided on household electric appliances, and the wireless communication apparatus 3 is mounted on the household electric appliances, whereby a connection relationship between the household electric appliances and the public communication network 40 is established to enable the provision of a network application capable of receiving an e-mail or data described in HTML from the e-mail server 53 and the WWW server.<br>
In the embodiment described above, there are network protocols such as a Bluetooth protocol, TCP/IP, and PPP, shown in FIG. 6, and application protocols such as SMTP, POP/IMAP, and HTTP to form a protocol stack. More concretely, there is a protocol as shown in FIG. 21, and it is possible to select a protocol used by a different service access point from the host equipment 4.<br>
That is, a protocol to be started can be switched adaptively according to the ability of the host equipment 4. For example, in cases where the service access point 4 is used, a base band 1011, a HCI (Host Control Interface) 1021, and an LMP (Link Management Protocol) 1031 constituting a Bluetooth lower protocol are started. Further, in cases where the service access point 3 is used, an L2CAP (Logical Link Control &amp; Adaptation Protocol) 1041, an RFCOMM 1051 and a SDP 1061<br><br>
constituting a Bluetooth upper protocol in addition to the above-described Bluetooth lower protocol are started. Further, in cases where the service access point 2 is used, a network communication protocol 1071 in addition to the aforementioned Bluetooth lower protocol and the Bluetooth upper protocol is started. Further, in cases where the service access point 1 is used, a network communication protocol 1081 in addition to the aforementioned Bluetooth upper protocol, the Bluetooth lower protocol, and the network communication protocol is started.<br>
Now, description will be made of, with reference to FIG. 21, a protocol stack constituted by protocols stored in ROM 71 of the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
At the lowest position of a protocol stack, a Baseband 1011 (and Radio) is present as a physical layer. In the physical layer, digital is converted into analog, and data is transmitted from an antenna section 62 or data is received by the antenna section 62. In this physical layer, primary modulation is carried out in accordance with the sequence of 0,1 of digital data, which is further put on a carrier wave of 2.4 GHz band and transmitted. The carrier wave is constantly switched by frequency hopping which changes frequency every transmission (slot) of one data.<br>
The transmission and reception of data are alternately carried out every slot. In the receiving slot, a carrier wave of 2.4 GHz band is removed from a signal received by the antenna, after which demodulation is further carried out to remove digital data of 0,1 sequences. Frequency of the carrier wave that should be removed<br><br>
is constantly changed by the frequency hopping, but the hopping sequence is known in advance according to the other communication party.<br>
On the physical layer are mounted protocols in the form of a link layer comprising an LMP (Link Management Protocol) 1031, a HCI (Hot Control Interface) 1021, a L2CAP (Logical Link Control &amp; Adaptation Protocol), and a RFCOMM 1051. A main part of the link layer is to control processing for constructing a short-distance wireless communication network 30 to which the Bluetooth system is applied.<br>
In the processing in the link layer, for example, a variety of communication information are added to original data and sent to the other party. When data is received, a reply is sent back whether or not the data is properly received. If not received property, re-sending is requested. In cases where the other party cannot be received even if data is sent many times, sending of data is given up when reaching a certain limit. When a receiving buffer overflows, the other party is requested to stop transmission temporarily. To data is added, in addition to information in connection with these communication control, a symbol for detecting and correcting an error in order to overcome an error produced in a communication line.<br>
The HCI 1021 provides an interface between host equipment 4 provided in the Bluetooth system. Further, the HCI 1021 carries out processing for providing a logical interface in the connection form in cases where the host equipment 4 is a personal computer.<br><br>
The LMP 1031 controls the link state relative to a connection destination of communication according to the Bluetooth system, which carries out the following:<br>
Establishment and release of the connection state;<br>
mode control according to presence or absence of data to be transmitted and<br>
received, and frequency of communication;<br>
switching of kinds of packets according to the condition of a communication<br>
line;<br>
authentication if data communication is permitted; and<br>
enciphering at the time of data communication.<br>
In the L2CAP 1041, a logical channel is defined. A logical channel, in which the connection between communication equipments corresponding to two Bluetooth systems is physically joined by a single communication line, can be defined in plural. Thereby, data of various kinds of upper protocols can be transmitted and received simultaneously. Further, in cases where size of data transmitted from the upper protocol is large, that (data) is fraction alized into size of a packet defined in the Base band 1011. The data is fractionalized on the transmission side and sent, and on the receiving side, that is reconstructed to the original size.<br>
Exchange of information between the host equipment 4 corresponding to the Bluetooth system at a communication destination with respect to the transfer rate and the speed of a response to the transmission is also carried out by the processing in the L2CAP 1041.<br><br>
The RFCOMM 1051 provides a expansion AT command for carrying out control in the link layer corresponding to the Bluetooth system. The RFCOMM 1051 provides an emulation function of a serial port.<br>
On the link layer is mounted a network communication protocol 1071 as a transport layer. The network communication protocol 1071 provides an interface for the data transfer on the Internet. The network communication protocol 1071 comprises TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), PPP (Point to Point Protocol), and DNS (Domain Memory System) resolver.,<br>
On an application layer above a transport layer is mounted a network application protocol 1081. In the network application protocol 1081, an Internet mail protocol (Internet Mail Protocol) is mounted to provide an interface for transmitting and receiving a mail between mail servers.<br>
The network application protocol 1081 includes, for example, POP 3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3) for receiving an e-mail from a mail server, IMAP 4 (Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4), and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for transmitting an e-mail to a mail server.<br>
Further, the wireless communication apparatus 3 is provided with a network setting memory section 68 internally of the system, and network setting information is stored in the network setting memory section 68. The network setting information stored in the network setting memory section 68 is used internally for a protocol sued<br><br>
internally of the wireless communication apparatus 3. The network setting information includes, as described above, a user ID for a protocol of PPP, a user password, an access point telephone number, a ail server address used in a protocol, a mail user ID , and a mail user password.<br>
In the aforementioned embodiment, it is supposed that the wireless communication apparatus 3 supports a protocol not possessed by the host equipment 4, and the network setting information stored in the network setting memory section 68 is utilized merely for the internal processing of the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
However, the host equipment 4 is provided with some protocols out of protocols already stored in the ROM 71 internally of the wireless communication apparatus 3, and in cases where the protocols require network setting information internally of the wireless communication apparatus 3, mere selection is left, that is, the information is set on the host equipment 4 side to use a protocol of the host equipment 4 or use of the protocol on the host equipment 4 side is given up to use a protocol within the wireless communication apparatus 3. In the former case, the user is caused to take operation of setting, while in the latter case, the protocol provided by the host equipment 4 becomes disabled to use resulting in uselessness. Particularly, in cases where processing ability of the host equipment 4 is high, or in cases where a protocol has a high function, there occurs a head in processing ability between the wireless communication apparatus 3 and the host equipment 4.<br><br>
So, in the embodiment described next, in cases where the wireless communication apparatus 3 has network setting information necessary for the protocol provided by the host equipment 4, means for the host equipment 4 to obtain the network setting information from the wireless communication apparatus 3 is prepared whereby the host equipment 4 obtains the network setting information through an application software to apply the information to protocol operation. Thereby, it is possible to carry out network application operation using the wireless communication apparatus 3 while making use of a protocol of the host equipment 4.<br>
The present embodiment describes that, for example, as shown in FIG. 22, supposing a mail processing terminal 4c by a personal computer (PC) as host equipment 4, PC applied with the wireless communication apparatus 3 dial-up connects with a provider 50 through a portable telephone 2 to utilize a mail service of the provider. The system constitution and its operation in the present embodiment are similar to those of the above-described embodiments.<br>
The present embodiment contemplates cases where the mail processing terminal 4c by PC has a network protocol of PPP, TCP/IP, and an application (mail) protocol such as POP, and SMIT.<br>
PC is generally high in processing ability as compared with a processor of the wireless communication apparatus 3, and therefore, in cases where both has the same protocol, it is desirable to use a protocol on the PC side. However, in that case, it is necessary to set network setting relative to the protocol on the PC side.<br><br>
So, in the present embodiment, there is provided means for obtaining network setting information used for a protocol provided by the mail processing terminal 4c by PC from the network setting memory section 68 of the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
The aforementioned means is realized by expanding a host equipment interface function in the embodiment previously described.<br>
Namely, the means is realized by a command issued to the wireless communication apparatus 3 from the mail processing terminal 4c by PC, and a response from the wireless communication apparatus 3 with respect thereto. For example, the mail processing terminal 4c by PC describing a sequence for obtaining network setting information by a system of an AT command issues, in Step ST 91, as shown in FIG. 23, a network setting information obtaining command {ATGETNETn <lf>} to the wireless communication apparatus 3. And, the wireless communication apparatus 3 interprets, in next Step ST 92, the network setting information obtaining command {ATGETNETn <lf>} received to read network setting information from the network setting memory section 68, and returns, in next Step ST 93, a network setting information obtaining response {+OK[network setting information <lf>} to the mail processing terminal 4c.<br>
The mail processing terminal 4c receives the network setting information obtaining response {+OK[network setting information <lf>} from the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br><br>
In this manner, the mail processing terminal 4c by PC designates a number n for giving a class of network setting information to a specific appellation, AT command {GETNET} to thereby obtain the network information designated. Further, since the network setting information contains information such as ID for discriminating individual information, and a password, it is desirable that this processing cannot be conducted from a suitable user. So, it is designed so that in cases where individual authentication has succeeded as shown in FIGS. 24 and 25 using an individual authentication sequence in the embodiment described previously, the network setting information can be obtained normally, otherwise cannot be obtained.<br>
That is, in the operation example shown in FIG. 24, the mail processing terminal 4c by PC issues, first, in Step ST 101, an individual authentication command {AUTH = [password] <crxlf>} to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
And, the wireless communication apparatus 3 interprets, in Step ST 102, the individual authentication command {AUTH = [password] <crxlf>} received from the mail processing terminal 4c to compare an individual authentication password stored in a command parameter with an individual authentication password stored in the individual authentication password memory section 66. In this operation example, since the individual authentication passwords are coincided, an individual authentication response {+OK<crxlf>} indicative of the fact that individual authentication was conducted normally is returned to the mail processing terminal 4c.<br>
Next, the mail processing terminal 4c by PC confirms, in next Step ST 104,<br><br>
that authentication processing has been succeeded by the individual authentication response {+OK<crxlf>} received from the wireless communication apparatus 3, and issues, in next Step ST 105, a network setting information obtaining command {ATGETNETn <crxlf>} to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
And, the wireless communication apparatus 3 interprets, in next Step ST 106, the network setting information obtaining command {ATGETNETn <crxlf>} received from the mail processing terminal 4c to read the network setting information from the network setting memory section 68, and returns, in next Step ST 107, a network setting information obtaining response {+OK[network setting information]<crxlf>} to the mail processing terminal 4c.<br>
As in the operation example shown in FIG. 24, the mail processing terminal 4c which has succeeded the authentication processing is able to receive the network setting information from the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
Further, in the operation example shown in FIG. 25, the mail processing terminal 4c by PC issues, first, in Step ST 111, an individual authentication command {AUTH = [password] <crxlf>} to the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
And, the wireless communication apparatus 3 interprets, in Step ST 112, the individual authentication command {AUTH = [password] <crxlf>} received from the mail processing terminal 4c to compare an individual authentication password stored in a command parameter with an individual authentication password stored in the individual authentication password memory section 66. Since in this operation<br><br>
example, the individual authentication passwords are not coincided, the apparatus 3 returns, in next Step ST113, an individual authentication response {-NG<crxlf>} indicative of the fact that the individual authentication has not been conducted normally to the mail processing terminal 4c.<br>
Next, the mail processing terminal 4c by PC confirms, in next Step ST 114, that the authentication processing has been failed by the individual authentication response {-NG<crxlf>} received from the wireless communication apparatus 3. In this case, for example, the mail terminal 4c stops issuing of a network setting information obtaining command to end a network setting information obtaining process. Further, in cases where even if the authentication processing has been failed, a network setting information obtaining command {ATGETNETn <crxlf>} was issued by the wireless communication apparatus 3, as shown in Step ST 115, the wireless communication apparatus 3 does not read, even if the former received the network setting information obtaining command {ATGETNETn <crxlf>} from the mail processing terminal 4c, network setting information from the network setting memory section 68, but returns, in next Step ST 117, a network setting information obtaining response {-NG<crxlf>} to the mail processing terminal 4c.<br>
As in the operation example shown in FIG. 25, the mail processing terminal 4c which has not succeeded the authentication processing is not able to receive network setting information from the wireless communication apparatus 3.<br>
In the following, software constitution of the mail processing terminal 4c will<br><br>
e described with reference to a concrete embodiment.<br>
The mail processing terminal 4c carries out, as shown in FIG. 26, an operation for obtaining the network setting information through an application software AS. Further, the network setting information obtained from the wireless communication apparatus 3 is applied to a protocol provided by the mail processing terminal 4c by PC.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 26, since the mail processing terminal 4c by PC is already provided with a network protocol A of PPP, TCP/IP corresponding to the network communication protocol 1071, and a mail protocol B such as POP, SMIT corresponding to the network application protocol 1081, the mail processing terminal 4B requests the wireless communication apparatus 3 of only a protocol of Bluetooth. That is, the service access point 3 or the service access point 4 in FIG. 21 is to be used. Accordingly, network setting information such as a user ID, and a user password necessary for a sequence of PPP, and a mail ID, a mail password, and a mail server name necessary for a mail protocol are obtained from the network setting memory section 68 of the wireless communication apparatus 3 to apply them to the corresponding protocol. In the above-described embodiment, all protocol processing have been carried out on the wireless communication apparatus 3 side in order to utilize the same application consequently, but in the present embodiment, the same application can be realized while using the protocol provided by the mail processing terminal 4c by PC.<br><br><br>
Further, another concrete examples of software constitution of the mail processing terminal 4c contemplated include application softwares for carrying out setting with respect to network application softwares which are already commercially available, such as dial-up network (PPP) of Microsoft Corporation, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Eudora of QUALCOM Incorporated, and Netscape of Netscape Communications Corporation. As shown in FIG. 27, the application software AS1 is a permanently stationary program in which when the wireless communication apparatus 3 is applied (inserted) to the mail processing terminal 4c by PC, network setting information is obtained from the wireless communication apparatus 3 to input a corresponding item into a setting window (a mail setting part a and a network setting part b) of the existing network application software AS2, whereas when the wireless communication apparatus 3 is removed (extracted), the network setting information item is deleted from the setting window.<br>
Thereby, also in cases where the existing network application software is used, network setting information of the wireless communication apparatus 3 is used whereby a network application which is unnecessary for setting with respect to the mail processing terminal 4c by PC can be provided for the user.
