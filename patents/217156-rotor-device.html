				<td>The present invention relates to a rotor device in which a rotor interacts with a fluid, a fluid being understood to be a gas or a liquid.<br>
Rotor devices for pumps and measuring devices have been developed as part of the prior art; in these, a rotor is held in equilibrium within a support tube by magnetic field forces. DE-A-29 19 236 describes a turbine counter for measuring the flow of liquids; in this, for purposes of radial stability, the rotor has two rotor magnets, which are permanent magnets, and which are spaced apart; stator magnets, which are similarly permanent magnets and arranged in pairs, are associated with the rotor magnets and surround the support tube. The rotor magnets and the stator magnets are magnetized in such a way that they repel each other in an axial direction.<br>
A electrical field coil is arranged between the stator magnets, and this surrounds the support tube like a ring. The field coil works in conjunction with a ferromagnetic flux deflector on the rotor, which is arranged between the rotor magnets. These is also a sensor that detects the axial position of the rotor and works in conjunction with a regulating device that controls the flow of electrical current in the field coil. As soon as the field forces of the rotor magnets and the stator magnets attempt to accelerate the rotor out of its position of equilibrium in the event of axial displacement, this axial displacement-measured by the sensor-results in an opposing and stabilizing field force. Thus, if it is shifted in an axial direction, in either direction, the rotor is<br>
always returned to its intended position. When this is done, the stabilizing axial forces are phase shifted over time, in the manner known per se, relative to the axial displacement, in such a way that the restoring and the damping forces stabilize the rotor in its intended position.<br>
One disadvantage of the rotor device described heretofore is that the rotor has only relatively slight bearing stiffness in a radial direction. The reason for this is the large amount of space between the stator magnets and the rotor magnets, because of the annular channel for conducting the fluid, which exists between the support tube and the rotor.<br>
DE-A-24 44 099 describes a magnetic bearing for bodies that are moved rapidly. This magnetic bearing has a sleeve-like rotor, with pole pieces that incorporate permanent magnets that are opposite its end faces; the rotor is held in a stable position because of the attractive force that is exerted by these. Deviations from the position of equilibrium can be identified by means of non-contact position sampling. Such deviations are balanced out by a non- volatile magnetic scatter field, annular coils that are arranged on the pole pieces, close to the gaps with the rotor, being provided for this purpose. For reasons of space, such a magnetic bearing is not suitable for arrangement within a support tube through which a fluid is to be passed.<br>
As far as pumps are concerned, magnetic bearings are used, in particular, for blood pumps. US-A-5,695,471 describes a blood pump that is configured as a radial pump with a radial rotor. The radial rotor is arranged within a support tube and in an input-side extension it has a plurality of<br>
rotor magnets that are associated with stator magnets on the support tube. In addition, the radial rotor has a plurality of bar-like rotor magnets that extend in a axial direction and are spaced around the periphery; annular stator magnets are associated with these on both sides of the radial rotor, on the sides of the support tube. These rotor magnets and stator magnets are intended to support the radial bearing in the area of the rotor extension. In the axial direction, the rotor is held mechanically at one end on a ball and at the other end in a toe bearing.<br>
The rotor is driven by means of a brushless, rotary field motor. To this end, there is a coil on the side of the support tube and this works in conjunction with a revolving-field magnets .that are let into the radial rotor..<br>
A disadvantage in this blood pump is that its bearing stability is not optimal in the radial direction, and that the pump is heavy and takes up a great deal of space because of its numerous rotor magnets and stator magnets. In addition, the purely mechanical bearing in the axial direction is subject to wear, which is a particular disadvantage in the case of implantable blood . pumps.<br>
It is known that axial pumps can also be used as blood pumps. Here, however, bearing support is provided exclusively by mechanical means in stators that are arranged so as to be fixed within the support tube, in front of and behind the rotor (Wernicke et al., A Fluid Dynamic Analysis Using Flow Visualization of the Baylor/NASA Implantable Axial Flow Blood Pump for Design<br>
Improvemen [sic], Artificial Organs 19(2), 1995, pp. 161-177). Such mechanical bearings are prone to wear and, in addition, have a deleterious effect on sensitive fluids, in particular body fluids such as blood.<br>
It is the objective of the present invention to so configure a rotor device of the type described in the introduction hereto that a much greater degree of bearing rigidity is achieved, particularly in a radial direction, thereby making it extremely versatile.<br>
According to the present invention, this objective has been achieved by the following features:<br>
a)	the rotor device has a support tube;<br>
b)	a rotor is supported within the support tube in such a way that it can rotate;<br>
c)	the rotor is configured so as to interact with the fluid flowing through the support tube;<br>
d)	at both its end faces, the rotor has rotor magnets that are permanent magnets and are<br>
magnetized axially;<br>
e)	arranged axially opposite the end faces of the rotor there are permanent magnet stator<br>
magnets that are connected to the support tube;<br>
f)	each stator magnet is so magnetized axially that the adjacent stator magnets and rotor<br>
magnets attract each other;<br>
g)	the rotor device has a magnetic axial stabilizing device for the rotor.<br>
As an alternative to this, the objective is achieved by a rotor device with the following features:<br>
a)	the rotor device has a support tube;<br>
b)	a rotor is supported within the support tube in such a way that it can rotate;<br>
c)	the rotor is configured so as to interact with the fluid within the support tube;<br>
d)	at each end face of the rotors, opposite each other, there are an axially magnetized<br>
permanent magnet and a flux deflector, the magnet being either mounted on the rotor as a<br>
rotor magnet or being connected to the support tube as a stator magnet;<br>
e)	g) the rotor device has a magnetic axial stabilizing device for the rotor.<br>
The underlying concept of the present invention is thus to generate a magnetic field in an axial direction, said magnetic field bridging the gap between the rotor magnets and the stator magnets by means of rotor magnets and stator magnets in an end-face arrangement, and that in each instance mutually attract the opposing pairs of rotor magnets and stator magnets. Because of this, given identical geometry, the bearing rigidity relative to the magnetic bearing described in DE-A-29 19 236 has been increased by at least a power often without any essential restriction of the annular channel between the carrier pipe and the rotor hub.<br>
The effect described heretofore also occurs if it is not two magnets, which is to say rotor magnets and stator magnets, that are opposite each other, but in each instance there is a magnet on one side and, on the other, a flux deflector.   Alternatively, the magnet can be mounted on the rotor as a rotor magnet, and the flux deflector can be connected to the support tube, or the flux<br>
deflector can be mounted on the rotor and the magnet can be mounted on the support tube as a stator magnet. Additionally, in order to achieve a high degree of bearing rigidity, electrical field coils can be provided in order to amplify the magnetizing of the flux deflector by increasing the attractive force between the magnets and the flux deflectors.<br>
Insofar as the rotor magnets and the stator magnets are opposite each other in pairs, it is preferred that they comprise at least two interlocking magnets, with radially adjacent magnets being of opposite polarity. This configuration of the rotor magnets and the stator magnets makes it possible to achieve bearing rigidity that is increased by a factor of 40.<br>
More expediently, the rotor is configured as an axial rotor so that if the rotor device is used as a pump, it will be an axial pump. Such an axial rotor is far less costly to configure than a radial rotor.<br>
The present invention also makes provision such that the rotor incorporates a rotor hub, and the rotor magnets or the flux deflectors are arranged in said rotor hub, the stator magnets or flux deflectors being arranged so as to be opposite the end faces of the rotor hub. The stator magnets or flux deflectors can be connected to the support tube through webs that facilitate the flow. Such an arrangement results in a compact structure and undesirable gaps are largely avoided. The stator magnets or the flux deflectors should be arranged in radial stabilizers whose outlines<br><br>
do not extend beyond the rotor hub, it being preferred that the radial stabilizers be of the same outline as the rotor hub.<br>
In a further configuration of the present invention, provision is made such that of the end faces of the radial stabilizers and of the rotor that are opposite each other, at least one is spherical. Such a configuration avoids mechanical interference from the areas of the rotor and the radial stabilizers that are remote from the axis when the rotor has been deflected in an axial direction. In order to limit the radial or axial mobility of the rotor, it is useful that the opposing end faces of the radial stabilizers and of the rotor be provided with interlocking complementary bearing pins and bearing recesses, appropriate radial play being provided to ensure that the bearing journals and the bearing recesses are in contact in the event of a relatively large displacement of the rotor in a radial direction.<br>
In a further version of the present invention, provision is made such that the rotor magnets and the stator magnets are arranged so as to be directly opposite each other, so that the most powerful magnetic field possible is generated.<br>
The present invention also proposes that the axial stabilizing device incorporate at least one electrical field coil and a regulating device with a sensor that detects the axial movement of the rotor, said regulating device so influencing the flow of electrical current that the magnetic field of the field coil(s) counteracts any axial movement of the rotor from its intended position. Such an<br>
axial stabilizing device is known in principle from DE-A 29 19 236 and from DE-A-24 44 099, and has already proven itself. More expediently, the axial stabilizing device should incorporate two field coils, which are arranged in the vicinity of the stator magnets and/or the end faces of the rotor, so that axial stabilization is particularly effective.<br>
There are two possibilities for arranging the field coils, namely, on the support tube, in such a manner that they surround the support tube; they can also be arranged within the radial stabilizers themselves, in which case, however, arrangements must be made to run the electrical lines to and from the field coils. It is preferred that the radial stabilizers have flux deflectors that can be magnetized and are arranged and configured in such a way that the axial magnetic field generated by the rotor magnets and the stator magnets is overlaid in an axial direction by the magnetic field generated by the field coils in the gap between the end faces of the radial stabilizers and the rotor, in such a way that any axial movement of the rotor from its intended position will be counteracted. The field coils themselves can be used as sensors to do this. The flux deflectors are best arranged at the level of the field coils.<br>
If the rotor device is to be part of a measuring device, it is expedient that the rotor have a pulse emitter and that the support tube incorporate a pulse receiver; and that the pulse emitter generate pulses for the pulse receiver that correspond to the speed of rotation of the rotor. This can be done in a simple manner in that the pulse emitter is configured as pulse magnet(s) and the pulse receiver be a coil, so that an electric current is induced in the coil when the rotor turns.<br>
In another version of the present invention, provision is made such that at the height of the rotor, the support tube has a rotary field stator that can be supplied with three-phase current, and the rotor has a radially magnetized revolving field. This results in a synchronous motor in which a revolving field can be generated by rotary current acting on a revolving field, so that a rotary movement can be imparted to the rotor. The rotor device thus has the characteristics of a motor and if the surface of the rotor is appropriately configured it can be used not only for measurement purposes, but also as a pump for delivering fluid. It is preferred that the revolving field magnet have at least four magnetic segments that are polarized in different radial directions, so that tumbling movements of the rotating rotor, caused by magnetic field asymmetry in the vicinity of the bearing gap between the rotor and the radial stabilizers, are counteracted. The revolving field stator should be connected to an electronic three-phase current generator that is acted on by a load angle regulator. Both the amount and the direction of the revolving field or torque that acts on the rotor can be set and stabilized by regulating the load angle.<br>
The rotor is adapted to the particular application. The rotor can have wing-like projections if the rotor device according to the present invention is to be used as an impeller or turbine-wheel device for measuring flow. If the rotor device has been augmented by a synchronous motor as described heretofore, it can be used as a delivery pump. To this end, for example, the surface of the rotor can be provided with at least one helical web, so that channels that perform the conveying function can be formed between the individual turns of the web. Pumps of this kind are widely used to generate a high vacuum.<br>
As an alternative to this, blade rings can be formed on the surface of the rotor, and these then intersect axially with complementary blade rings on the inside walls of the support tube. The most varied possible uses, for example, in gas turbines or in high-vacuum pumps, will arise, depending on the configuration of the blade rings.<br>
The configuration of the blade ring described above can be combined with helical channels. This results in what is referred to in vacuum technology as a compound pump, which has a particularly high compression ratio.<br>
In place of having blade rings and webs, the surface of the rotor can be configured so as to be smooth, in particular cylindrical. If the rotor device incorporates a synchronous motor, in the manner described heretofore, the viscosity of gaseous or liquid media can be measured in that the electrical power consumption of the synchronous motor required to maintain a specific speed of rotation of the rotor can be measured. This is essentially proportional to the friction at the surface of the rotor, the friction being-in its turn-a function of the viscosity of the medium surrounding the rotor.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, it is proposed that the surface of the rotor have at last one projection that extends outward, and there be a sensor that detects the axial position of the rotor and generates a signal that is proportional to the axial position. This projection, for example in the form of an annular web, offers the possibility of measuring the<br>
axial flow velocity of a gaseous or liquid medium, in that the axial force transferred from the flow by way of the projection on the rotor is determined from the corresponding axial shift in the position of the rotor, if the axial stabilizing device generates an appropriate signal. Both measures can be combined, if the rotor device is provided with a synchronous motor, as described heretofore. Then the axial shift of the rotor and the power that is transferred to the rotor can be identified with the help of the synchronous motor so that both the flow velocity and the viscosity of the liquid can be measured simultaneously.<br>
The present invention will be described in greater detail below on the basis of embodiments shown in the drawings appended hereto. The drawings show the following:<br>

invention, as a measuring device; Figure 2:      a longitudinal cross section through the combination of support tube and rotor in a<br>
second version for a pump; Figure 3:      a longitudinal cross section through the combination of rotor and support tube in a<br>
third version for a pump; Figure 4:      a longitudinal cross section through the combination of rotor and support tube in a<br>
fourth version for a pump; Figure 5:      a longitudinal cross section through the combination of rotor hub and radial<br>
stabilizers in a fifth version.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rotor device, numbered 1 in total, for installation in a pipe that carries either a liquid or a gas. The rotor device 1 has a cylindrical support tube 2 that can be installed in a pipe through flanges, not shown herein, as an intermediate section, so that the liquid or gas flows through the support tube 2.<br>
Centrally in the support tube 2 there is a rotor 3 that has a cylindrical rotor hub 4; blades 5, 6 are formed on the outside of this hub. In the end areas the rotor hub includes rotor magnets 7, 8 that are permanent magnets that are magnetized axially. Between the rotor magnets 7, 8 there is a revolving field magnet 9 that is magnetized in four radial directions distributed around its periphery.<br>
Radial stabilizers 10, 11 are arranged adjacent to the two end faces of the rotor hub 4 and these are secured through webs 12, 13, 14, 15 to the inner side of the support tube 2 and coaxially to the rotor 3 so that they are axially symmetrical with the rotor 3. The radial stabilizers 10, 11 have cylindrical stabilizer sleeves 16, 17 whose diameter is the same as the diameter of the rotor hub 4. As far as their outside shape is concerned, the radial stabilizers 10, 11 form extensions of the rotor hub 4. In their areas that are adjacent to the rotor 3, each of the stabilizer sleeves 16, 17 includes a stator magnet 18, 19 that is a permanent magnet, these stator magnets being so magnetized axially that an axially oriented magnetic field that attracts the rotor 3 is formed in the gaps between the radial stabilizers 10, 11 and the rotor 3. These magnetic fields ensure that the rotor 3 is always held centrally to the axis of the support tube 2, which is to say that any possible<br>
radial deflections are immediately corrected. This results in a high level of bearing stiffness in a radial direction.<br>
The radial stabilizers 10 have additional ferromagnetic flux deflectors 20, 21 that work in conjunction with annular electrical field coils 22, 23 of an axial stabilizer device. The field coils 22,23 are arranged at the level of the flux deflectors 20, 21 and surround the outside of the support tube 2. The.are installed within an annular housing 24 that surrounds the support tube 2 and simultaneously serves as a flux deflector for the field coils 22, 23. The two field coils 22, 23 are connected through electrical lines 25, 26 to a regulating device 27. The regulating device 27 supplies exciter current to the field coils 22, 23. This means that the magnetic flux within the gaps between the rotor 3 and the radial stabilizers 10,11 is so overlaid and regulated that the rotor 3 assumes an axially stable position between the radial stabilizers 10, 11 in which there is not contact on any side. Thus, the field coils 22, 23 are used not only for regulating the flux, but also, and simultaneously, for non-contact sampling of the axial position of the rotor 3, as is effected in a similar manner with the magnetic bearing described in DE-A-24 44 099.<br>
An annular revolving-field stator is arranged within the housing 24, between the two field coils 22, 23, and together with the revolving field magnet 9 within the rotor 3 these form a synchronous motor. To this end, the revolving field stator is connected to an electronic rotary-current generator 29. This can apply a rotary current to the revolving field stator 28, so that both<br>
the amount and the direction of the revolving field or torque that acts on the rotor can be set and stabilized by regulation of the load angle.<br>
The rotor device 1 described heretofore can be used for various purposes. It can, for example, be used to measure the quantity of liquids and gases flowing through pipelines. In this case, the blades 5, 6 are so configured that the liquid flowing in the annular channel between rotor 3 and support tube causes the rotor 3 to turn at a speed that is proportional to the velocity of the liquid, the velocity of the flow being a measure for the volume of medium that is flowing through. Gaseous media can also be measured. The speed of rotation of the rotor can, for example, be measured by tapping off the pulses inductively at the revolving field stator, the revolving field magnet 9 forming the pulse transmitter. In this connection, it is advantageous from the standpoint of measurement accuracy that the rotor 3 of the magnetic bearing 1 be supported so as not to be affected by friction, and for all practical purposes is not subjected to any wear, and thus requires no maintenance.<br>
If the rotor 3 is configured without blades 5, 6, and thus has a smooth, cylindrical outer surface, the rotor device 1 according to the present invention can also be used to measure the viscosity of gaseous or liquid media. To this end, the rotor 3 is set in motion with the help of the rotary-current generator 29 and the synchronous motor that is made up o f the rotary field stator 28 and the revolving field magnet 9. The electrical power that the synchronous motor requires to maintain a specific speed of rotation of the rotor is measured. This is essentially proportional to<br>
the friction on the outside surface of the rotor 3. The friction is, in its turn, a measure for the viscosity of the medium surrounding the rotor 3.<br>
The examples shown in Figure 2 to 4 differ from the version shown in Figure 1 only in the shape of the rotor, the parts that are outside the support tube 2 being identical to the parts shown for the embodiment in Figure 1; these have been omitted in order to achieve greater clarity. In Figures 2 to 4, those parts that are of the same configuration and/or perform the same function bear the same numbers as the same parts in Figure 1. The parts that are located outside the support tube 2 are identical to the parts shown in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 and have been omitted for reasons of greater clarity. In Figures 2 to 4, the parts bear the same reference numbers as those used in Figure 1 that perform the same function or are of the same configuration.<br>
In Figure 2, the rotor 30 is of an outside diameter that is almost the same as the inside diameter of the support tube 2. In its outer surface there are helical channels, for example, those numbered 31.   When it functions as a delivery pump, the rotor 30 can be caused to rotate by the synchronous motor that comprises the rotary field stator 28 and the revolving field magnet 9. Such a rotor device 1 can be used to generate a high vacuum.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, a rotor 32 is configured with a total of eight blade rings-numbered 33, for example-mat are arranged so as to be spaced apart; these blade rings comprise a plurality of individual blades, numbered 34, for example. Blade rings, numbered 35, for<br>
example, that are secured to the support tube 4, extend into the spaces between the blade rings 33. These also comprise individual blades. The blade rings 33 and 35 form the flow section of a turbo-compressor. A gaseous medium can be delivered as if by a turbo-compressor by driving the rotor 32 by the synchronous motor that comprises the rotary field stator 28 and the revolving field magnet 9.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 4, there is a rotor 36 whose outside shape differs from that of the rotor 3 shown in Figure 1 only in that the essentially smooth cylindrical outside surface incorporates an annular web 37 at its axial mid-point. This annular web 37 forms a resistance to the flow of a medium through the support tube 2. This transmits an axial force onto the rotor 36, and this leads to an corresponding axial change in the position of the rotor 36. This is picked up by the field coils 22, 23, and triggers an electrical signal that is proportional to the axial shift in the control device 27 that is-in its turn-proportional to the velocity of the flow.<br>
Since the axial force exerted on the rotor 36 by the medium that is flowing through is a function not only of the velocity of the medium, but also of its viscosity, it is helpful if the viscosity of the medium that is flowing through be determined at the same time. This is done-as described heretofore in connection with the smooth rotor 3-in that the rotor 36 is caused to rotate in a specific manner by the synchronous motor, when the power required to do this is identified and used as a measure for the viscosity of the liquid that is flowing through.<br>
In order to avoid mechanical interference from the areas of the rotor 36 that are remote from the axis, the rotor 36 has a spherical end face 38. If there is contact between the rotor 36 and the radial stabilizer 10, because of this configuration it is confined to the central area with a low peripheral speed. It is, of course, understood that the lower end face 39 can also be of a similar spherical shape.<br>
The lower radial stabilizer 11 has a bearing pin 40 at the axial midpoint of the end face that is adjacent to the rotor 36 and this fits in a bearing recess 41 in the rotor 36. Between the bearing pin 40 and the bearing recess 41 there is sufficient clearance that in the case of normal radial deviation of the rotor 36 there is no contact between them. Only when the radial deflection becomes too great do the bearing pin 40 and the bearing recess 41 prevent any further radial movement. Such a radial bearing can also be provided in the area of the upper radial stabilizer 10, of course.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, the support tube 2 with all the parts arranged thereon has been omitted in the interests of greater clarity. Figure 5 shows a rotor 42 that is held magnetically between two radial stabilizers 43,44. The rotor 42 has a rotor hub 45 that has a smooth exterior and that is of circular cross section; its cross section continues with the radial stabilizers 43,44. Not shown in this drawing are the webs 12,13,14, and 15, shown in Figure 1, by which the radial stabilizers 43,44 are secured to the inner side of the support tube 2.<br>
At each of its ends, the rotor 42 has a rotor magnet 46, 47. Both rotor magnets 46, 47 are formed in two parts. Each comprises a cylindrical inner magnet 48, 49 and an annular outer magnet 50, 51 that surrounds these. The inner sides of the outer magnets 50, 51 lie against the adjacent inner magnets 48, 49, respectively.<br>
A stator magnet 52, 53 is opposite each rotor magnet 46, 47. The stator magnets 52, 53 are similarly constructed in two parts, in the same way as the rotor magnets 46,47, i.e, each of them has a cylindrical inner magnet 54, 55 and an annular outer magnet 56, 57 rests against them and . surrounds them. The diameter of the inner magnets 54, 55 of the stator magnets 52, 53 corresponds to the diameter of the inner magnets 48,49 of the rotor magnets 46,47, whereas the diameter of the outer magnets 56, 57 of the stator magnets 52, 53, is the same as the diameter of the outer magnets 50, 51 of the rotor magnets 46, 47. They are all arranged axially.<br>
The rotor magnets 46, 47 and the stator magnets 52, 53 are magnetized in such a manner that each adjacent pair of magnets attracts each other mutually across the whole of their surfaces. The special feature of the present embodiment is such that the inside magnets 48, 54, or 49, 55 that are arranged opposite each other in pairs are magnetized axially away from the rotor 42, whereas the outer magnets that are 50, 56, or 51, 57, respectively, that are opposite each other in pairs are magnetized in the opposite direction, namely, axially in the direction of the rotor 42. This is symbolized by the arrows. This opposing magnetization greatly increases the stiffness of the bearing of the rotor 42 in a radial direction.<br>
Pot-core coils 58, 59 are arranged in the radial stabilizers 43,44; each of these consists of a pot-shaped ferromagnetic yoke 60, 61 and an electrical coil 62, 63 that is arranged therein. The yokes 60, 61 are open towards the stator magnets 52, 53. The mid-point diameter of the coils 62, 63 corresponds to the outside diameter of each adjacent inner magnet 54, 55. The coils 62, 63 are connected through electrical lines 64, 65 to a control device 66. The control device 66 supplies the coils 62, 63 with exciter current. Depending on the direction of the current, the axial magnetic flux in the gap between the rotor 42 and the radial stabilizers 43,44 can be either intensified or diminished, as is indicated by the double-headed arrow at the centre. The axial forces that are effective there are varied in such a way that the rotor 42 is always guided in the axial midpoint between the radial stabilizers 43, 44.<br><br><br><br><br>
