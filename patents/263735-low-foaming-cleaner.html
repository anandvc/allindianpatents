				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
This invention relates to a composition for use for general cleaning, and in particular for<br>
use in cleaning medical instruments and which is effective for soil removal and protein<br>
digestion while remaining low foaming.<br>
Background<br>
The incidence has been widely reported of post procedural infections associated with<br>
surgery or diagnostic studies. It is believed that a significant number of these infections<br>
are due to inadequate reusable instrument reprocessing.<br>
Cleaning of instruments on an industrial scale involves two steps. In the first step the<br>
instrument is cleaned and in the second step it is disinfected normally to "high level<br>
disinfection" or "sterilization" standards. It is generally accepted that failure to adequately<br>
clean items after use in the first step may compromise the efficacy of the second. The<br>
elimination of human proteins from the instruments represents a significant challenge.<br>
The challenge has been made more difficult as medical instruments have been developed,<br>
for example endoscopes, which utilize materials that are neither temperature resistant nor<br>
chemically inert.<br>
For effective cleaning of medical instruments a preparation should be effective for soil<br>
removal, effective for protein digestion and resist foaming. In addition, the products are<br>
required to have stability and a long shelf life.<br>
These desiderata tend to be mutually inconsistent objectives. In order to avoid foaming,<br>
soil removal preparations used in hospital cleaning/sterilizing "reprocessing" systems have<br>
mainly utilized highly alkaline non-foaming detergents, but their use is incompatible with<br>
both enzymes, and with materials of construction of flexible endoscopes. The use of close<br>
to neutral "enzymatic detergents" (preparations including both enzymes and detergents)<br>
has been found to be relatively effective for removal of proteins and safe with endoscopes,<br>
and enables acceptable levels of soil removal to be achieved. However, while enzymes in<br>
"enzymatic detergents" help to remove proteins, surfactants have been needed to remove<br><br>
the fats and carbohydrates. Due to the incorporation of surfactants, "enzymatic detergents"<br>
tend to produce foam to an unacceptable extent.<br>
Foaming is undesirable because it blocks the visualization of instruments in manual<br>
cleaning baths, impedes access of washing liquor to soils during manual cleaning and<br>
blocks water jets and washing liquor circulation in automated washers (e.g. tunnel<br>
washers). The foams tend to block the lumens of instruments preventing effective<br>
cleaning of the lumen interior. When enzyme based cleaners have been used in<br>
reprocessing machinery the foam tends to fill the volume thus impeding the cleaning cycle<br>
by disrupting jets and agitation. Furthermore it makes the machine difficult to unload,<br>
interfering with proper draining, and leaving foam residues containing pathogens which<br>
can contaminate following cleaning cycles giving rise to significant risk of cross infection<br>
since the cleaners do not kill the micro-organisms which they dislodge from surfaces.<br>
Instruments covered with foam require additional handling and washing before they can<br>
be sterilized. Increasingly the additional labour cost, time, and water consumption costs<br>
are regarded as unacceptable. Multiple guidelines and standards recognise the problem<br>
and warn against using foaming detergents for cleaning medical instruments (e.g. AS<br>
4187:2003 or AS 4815:2006).<br>
Although this problem has been recognized, it has not to date been satisfactorily<br>
overcome. Two solutions to the foaming problem have been utilized, however to date<br>
neither approach has succeeded in satisfying the market need.<br>
In the first approach antifoams have been added to the cleaning composition or washer,<br>
but that has been unsatisfactory because antifoams leave unacceptable residues on the<br>
medical instruments. In the second approach attempts have been made to use so called<br>
'â€¢low foaming" non-ionic detergents such as alkylene oxide adducts. These tend to leave<br>
an undesirable film of oily residue on treated surfaces similar to that from antifoams and<br>
also produce hazy solutions which reduce visibility during washing cycles.<br>
As a consequence commercially available formulations results tend to be either<br>
inadequately cleansing, or high foaming, and thus not suitable for use for cleaning medical<br><br>
instruments, or tend to be unstable and possess an inadequate shelf life, due to denaturing<br>
of the enzymes by surfactants employed.<br>
Cheetham (Australian Infection Control, Sept 2005,10, 3, p103-109) compared 17 market<br>
leading enzyme based medical instrument cleaners from eight manufacturers (Table 1).<br><br>
The products were tested using SDS - PAGE methodology to compare the molecular<br>
weights of a group of standardised blood proteins before and after exposure to the various<br>
cleaning products. Cheetham reported that half of the products tested, when used in<br>
accordance with the manufacturers' directions, exhibited little or no protein digestion, and<br>
only two of the products (Rapid 70500 and Rapid 70501 - both from 3M and also known<br>
as RMEC 70500 and RMEC 70501 respectively) provided a high degree of protein<br>
digestion. Cheetham did not report on foaming properties or stability. The present<br>
Applicant has tested the two products which provided a high degree of protein digestion<br>
and found that one exhibits high level of foaming while the other contains alkylene oxide<br>
block copolymer and leaves undesirable oily residues on the treated surface. Moreover,<br><br>
while both exhibit good stability with easily inhibited enzymes, both show poor stability<br>
with difficult to inhibit enzymes.<br>
Further, whilst the problem has been outlined with respect to cleaning medical<br>
instruments, the desire for cleaning compositions which are efficacious in removing soil<br>
and digesting proteins whilst resisting foaming is not limited to the field of cleaning<br>
medical instruments. Such properties, along with stability and a long shelf life, are<br>
desirable in many different cleaning applications.<br>
A further area where low foaming cleaning compositions are desirable is in the area of air<br>
conditioning and cooling. For instance, fresh food cool rooms have their temperature<br>
controlled by a refrigeration unit fitted with fans which is integral with the room. The fans<br>
draw environmental air through a refrigerated cooling coil heat exchanger into the room.<br>
The process of cooling the air results in a lowering of humidity with the moisture being<br>
condensed onto the cold surfaces of the heat exchanger. It is well known that any<br>
environmental surface which is continually wet or damp will become covered in biofilm.<br>
This biofilm not only reduces heat exchange efficiency, but is a very significant potential<br>
source of microbiological contamination into the room and is therefore undesirable.<br>
There currently only limited number of existing methods of removing biofilm from heat<br>
exchange coils. The biofilm may be removed with abrasive brushes or high pressure<br>
water. This has proved to be problematic because the spaces between the cooling fins are<br>
insufficient to allow efficient brushing and the surface areas so extensive as to make this<br>
brushing an extremely tedious process. High pressure water has proven to be undesirable<br>
because it damages the cooling fins which are made of thin aluminium sections.<br>
Alternatively, the heat exchange coil may be washed with strong alkali or strong acid.<br>
This has proved to be problematic because the alkali or acid, whilst eventually removing<br>
the biofilm both causes significant corrosive damage to the aluminium fins and the copper<br>
refrigeration tubes to which they are attached. This corrosion severely limits the service<br>
life of the heat exchange coil.<br><br>
Thus, it is desirable to have effective yet non-corrosive cleaning agents that act without<br>
producing large quantities of foam.<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be<br>
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common<br>
general knowledge in the field.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved composition for cleaning,<br>
and in particular cleaning medical instruments which avoids or ameliorates at least some<br>
of the disadvantages of prior art. It is an object of preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention to provide a composition for cleaning, and in particular cleaning medical<br>
instruments which is low foaming, has excellent enzyme shelf stability and is effective for<br>
soil removal and protein digestion.<br>
Brief Statement of invention.<br>
The present invention provides liquid compositions which provide high levels of soil<br>
removal, exhibit superior protease stability, and minimize foaming to acceptable levels<br>
without leaving undesirable levels of residues. The compositions exhibit very high enzyme<br>
shelf life stability.<br>
In a broad aspect, the invention provides a liquid for cleaning, said composition excluding<br>
surfactants and comprising one or more enzymes including a protease, a solvent system<br>
including a water soluble glycol ether solvent, at least one anionic hydrotrope, and<br>
wherein the molar ratio of said at least one hydrotrope to said glycol ether in the<br>
composition is selected to preserve the activity of said one or more enzymes.<br>
According to a first aspect the invention provides a liquid composition for cleaning<br>
medical instruments, said composition excluding surfactants and comprising one or more<br>
enzymes including a protease, a solvent system including a water soluble glycol ether<br>
solvent, at least one anionic hydrotrope, and wherein the molar ratio of said at least one<br><br>
hydrotrope to said glycol ether in the composition is selected to preserve the activity of<br>
said one or more enzymes.<br>
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims,<br>
the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense<br>
as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including,<br>
but not limited to".<br>
In preferred embodiments the composition includes several additional hydrolase enzymes<br>
in addition to a protease or proteases, said hydrolase enzymes including but not limited to<br>
lipases, cellulases and amylases.<br>
Desirably, the hydrotrope is an anionic hydrotrope selected from the group consisting of<br>
water soluble anionic hydrotropes of the formula:<br><br>
and more preferably of the formula<br><br>
and having no alkyl side chain greater than six carbons in length.<br>
In preferred hydrotropes R and R are independently alkyl groups of from 1 to six<br>
carbons, although R1 or R2 may optionally be hydrogen. Preferred hydrotropes have a<br>
short chain (less than six, and preferably from one to four carbons, and more preferably<br>
from one to two carbons). Very highly preferred hydrotropes are water soluble xylene<br>
sulfonate (R1 is methyl, R2 is methyl) and cumene sulfonate (R1 is isopropyl, R2 is<br>
hydrogen) salts.<br><br>
Since both anionic hydrotropes and glycol ether solvents are considered strong protein<br>
(and enzyme) denaturing agents it is surprising that compositions according to the<br>
invention possess all the above desiderata:<br>
- non foaming<br>
excellent enzyme shelf-life stability<br>
excellent cleaning performance against standard medical soils,<br>
leaves no undesirable residues<br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a composition according to the first<br>
aspect wherein the molar ratio of hydrotope: glycol ether is selected to be greater than 1.1:<br>
1. More preferably the weight ratio of hydrotope: glycol ether is greater than 1.2: lor<br>
better still is greater than 1.5:1.<br>
According to a third aspect the invention provides a composition according to the first or<br>
second aspect in a concentrate adapted to be diluted for use by at least 20 parts of water to<br>
1 part of the concentrate (100 to 1000 parts of water to 1 part of concentrate in preferred<br>
embodiments) and wherein the hydrotrope is selected from the group comprising of water<br>
soluble aromatic sulfonates with one or more short (C1-C6) side alkyl chains..<br>
According to a fourth aspect the invention provides a composition according to the first or<br>
second aspect wherein the solvent comprises in combination at least one glycol ether, at<br>
least one polyhydric alcohol, and water containing boron or borate ions.<br>
According to a fifth aspect the invention provides a composition according to any one of<br>
the preceding aspects wherein each component of the composition is selected so as to<br>
exclude compounds incorporating an alkyl chain of longer than six carbons.<br>
The concentration ratios are critical for prevention of enzyme deterioration on storage.<br>
The weight ratio of hydrotrope to proteolytic enzyme to should be between 400:1 and<br>
200:1, more preferably 300:1 and 350:1 and the concentration of hydrotrope should not<br>
exceed 25 %. The molar ratio of glycol ether to polyhydric alcohols is preferably between<br>
0.2:1 and 1:1<br><br>
The compositions of the present invention are particularly suited to cleaning medical<br>
instruments, and have been principally described with reference to that use, however, it<br>
will be appreciated that the cleaning compositions of the present invention are by no<br>
means limited to that use. They may be used in any circumstances where it is desired to<br>
clean biological matter from surfaces, including industrial and domestic applications, for<br>
example, in cleaning down any wet surface contaminated with proteinaceous materials, or<br>
cleaning refrigeration coils. The compositions of the present invention have been found to<br>
be especially efficacious for cleaning the interior of cooling towers and the heat exchange<br>
surfaces of heat exchange equipment involving water.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Compositions according to the invention are shown in examples 1, 2, 3.<br>
These differ from each other primarily in that the molar ratio of sodium xylene sulfonate<br>
to glycol ether in the compositions is 1.1:1; 1.2:1 and 1.6:1 respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In use, compositions according to the invention may be stored as concentrates for periods<br>
of at least 18 months at 25Â°C and should be diluted by tap water from 20:1 to 1000:1<br>
before use.<br>
Table 2 below summarises the performance of the best of the compositions evaluated by<br>
Cheetham as referred to above and identified in table 1. Table 2 compares in summary<br>
form 12 commercially available cleaners in terms of shelf life protease stability (columns<br>
2 and 3), soil removal efficacy (column 4), residual foam height (column 5) and presence<br>
of potential residue. The three most effective commercially available compositions in<br>
terms of soil removal were Cidezyme, 3M Rapid 70505 and 3M 70500 all of which scored<br>
10. However, of these 3M Rapid 70500 produced a residual foam height of 500 ml which<br>
is unacceptable, while 3M rapid 70505 left an oily residue which is also unsatisfactory.<br>
The Cidezyme passed the residual foam height test without any residue. However<br>
Cidezyme failed on both the stable and unstable proteases shelf life stability tests. In<br>
comparison formulations according to examples 1, 2, 3 of the invention achieved excellent<br>
soil removal and passed each of the tests.<br><br><br>
Table 3 below shows the results for comparative examples 4 and 5. These examples differ<br>
from examples 1 to 3 in that the molar ratio of hydrotrope to glycol ether is not selected to<br>
preserve the activity of said one or more enzymes, and is below 1.0:1 and 0.9:1<br>
respectively. This shows that to achieve stability for the compositions exemplified the<br>
mole ratio of hydrotrope to glycol ether should be selected to be above 1.1:1. However<br>
the ratio required to be selected could be determined for other compositions within the<br>
scope of the invention having regard to the teachings herein disclosed.<br><br><br>
Details of the tests used and results obtained to prepare the data in tables 2 and 3 above are<br>
given below:<br>
1. Soil removal test<br>
Scope: This method allows for a qualitative and/or quantitative assessment of the relative<br>
efficacy of cleaners and detergents in removing a simulated medical soil.<br>
Browne indicator strips - STF load check indicators (Albert Browne Ltd Leicester UK) -<br>
are designed to ensure and assist in documenting the cleaning efficacy of tunnel washers,<br>
single chamber washer-disinfectors, etc. The indicator consists of a plastic substrate, with<br>
a patch of protein-based soil applied to both sides. This simulates a very difficult to<br>
remove medical soil. The amount of soil remaining on the strip after detergent treatment<br>
can be assessed visually.<br>
Preparation of samples for Soil removal test<br>
125 ml beakers with 99Â±0.5 ml of tap water are placed in a water bath to equilibrate to<br>
required temperature for approximately 30 minutes.<br>
The required amount of test product/sample detergent is then added to each beaker and<br>
stirred gently. One beaker is left as a control with the addition of 1ml of water instead of<br>
test product. These solutions are left for a further 5 minutes to equilibrate to temperature.<br><br>
Browne STF Load Check Indicator strips (Browne strip) are cut in half (to give two test<br>
strips) and then added to each beaker. The dimensions of the beaker are selected to enable<br>
the strip to be positioned at an angle whilst being fully submerged in the test solution.<br>
At the end of the prescribed time interval the strips are carefully removed with clean<br>
tweezers ensuring that no contact is made with the soiled patch on either side of the strip.<br>
The strips were then dipped in clean tap water briefly and then allowed to drip dry. After<br>
drying the strips are placed on white paper and photographed for visual assessment.<br>
Estimation of the degree of soil removal<br>
The degree of soil removal is generally measured on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the<br>
lowest degree (No visible soil removal) and 10 being the highest degree (complete soil<br>
removal).<br>
(b) Soil removal Results<br>
The best commercially available enzymatic detergents (per Cheetham - see appended<br>
table 1) were compared with formulations according to the invention using the soil<br>
removal test described above with the results shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
2. Protease Shelf Life stability Tests<br>
Scope: The test allows comparison of ingredients of enzymatic formulations in respect of<br>
their ability to preserve protease activity during storage.<br>
Enzymatic activity is known to decrease over time due to protein denaturing and auto-<br>
proteolysis (self-digestion). These processes are dramatically accelerated by increase in<br>
temperature - each 10 degrees temperature rise increases the rate of denaturing by up to 8<br>
times. The loss of proteolytic activity over time is quantified for each product and<br>
expressed as percentage for each formulation.<br>
Procedure:<br>
Denature any remaining protease in cleaners under study by gentle boiling of each product<br>
for 2-3 min in a capped beaker,<br><br>
1.	Cool and confirm absence of proteolytic activity using protease test strips,<br>
2.	Add 10% w/w of test protease. In "Test A" a stable protease (Savinase Ultra 16XL,<br>
from Novozymes) is used. In "Test B" a relatively unstable enzyme (Savinase 16L,<br>
from Novazymes) is used. If practical, both the well stabilised and a poorly<br>
stabilised enzyme are used in the same assay - e.g. Savinase Ultra 16XL AND<br>
Savinase 16L from Novozymes.<br>
3.	Divide each prepared sample into three and store at 4, 25 and 40 Â°C<br>
4.	Assay and report initial protease activity<br>
5.	After 14 days assay remaining protease activity of each sample<br>
Report the percentage of protease activity loss at each temperature.<br>
A loss of 5% or less of initial protease activity for both stable and unstable proteases in<br>
table 5 is regarded as a "pass".<br>
(b) Results for stable and unstable protease shelf life tests.<br>
The results obtained for each of the compositions listed in table 4 in respect of stable and<br>
unstable Protease shelf life tests described above is shown in Table 5:<br><br><br><br>
3 Foam volume test and Residue Presence tests<br>
Principle (foam volume)<br>
An increase in foam volume was determined by blending for 30 sees using a<br>
commercial type blender with glass jar at 25 Â± 1Â°C agitated at ~ 6000 rpm, and then<br>
measuring the increase in total volume of test fluid including foam.<br>
Apparatus<br>
Blender: A Moulinex commercial blender was used. The glass jar was volume<br>
graduated (20-25mL marks).<br>
Procedure (foam volume)<br>
1.	Clean and rinse the blender with distilled water using 10s blends and fresh samples<br>
of distilled water until blending develops no appreciable foam. If a foam persist, clean<br>
with alcohol, followed by at least three rinses with distilled water.<br>
2.	Using the manufacturer's recommended dilutions prepare 500 ml of solution<br>
3.	Pour the test liquid into a clean glass bottle or jar and store it at 25Â°Â± 1Â°C for a<br>
minimum of 1 h and a maximum of 2 h in the constant temperature water bath deep<br>
enough so that the water level is at least 10 mm above the air/test fluid interface.<br>
4.	Pour the test liquid into the blender jar.<br>
5.	Measure and record the test liquid volume, disregarding any foam. Call this the<br>
initial volume I.<br><br>
6.	Blend for 30 Â± 1 s at selected speed.<br>
7.	Shut off the blender and immediately measure the total volume including foam.<br>
Subtract initial volume of solution (I) and report as foam volume.<br>
A residual foam height of less than 100 is accepted as a "pass".<br>
Residue Presence Test<br>
Scope: Report oily residues, if present.<br>
Method: Oily residues can be easily observed on glass slides using dissecting microscope<br>
and lateral lighting.<br>
Pre cleaned microscope glass slides were dipped into diluted enzymatic cleaner and then<br>
gently rinsed by dipping the slide once into a beaker with distilled water. The slide was<br>
allowed to drip dry before assaying for presence of residues<br>
Any detectable residue is a "fail". No detected residue is a "pass".<br>
(b) Results for Residual Foam Volume and Residue Presence tests.<br>
The results obtained for each of the compositions listed in table 4 in respect of the foam<br>
volume test and residue presence test described above is shown in Table 6:<br><br><br><br>
By way of further example, appended figures 1 - 4 illustrate differences in<br>
foaming/residue properties. Figures 1-4 simulate normal usage procedures in which a<br>
concentrate is measured into a container and then the required amount of water is added.<br>
The result is photographed without stirring.<br>
Figure 1 shows medical instruments in a container filled with 3M Rapid Multi enzyme<br>
Cleaner 70500 - one of the two best performers in the Cheetham study. The instruments<br>
are hardly visible because of foam.<br>
Figure 2 shows the same product (3M Rapid Multi enzyme Cleaner 70500) in a beaker<br>
with a stable volume of foam above the liquid.<br>
Figure 3 shows the other of the best performers (3M Rapid 70505). A visible undesirable<br>
milky residue is suspended in the cloudy liquid.<br>
Figure 4 corresponds to figure 1 when a composition according to the invention (example<br>
2) is employed.<br>
In the compositions exemplified the ratios of hydrotrope to protease and of DPM to<br>
polyhydric alcohols for each of the compositions is shown in table 7<br><br><br>
Example 7 - Cleaning heat exchanger<br>
The low foaming compositions of the present invention was used to clean a heat<br>
exchanger. A two step process was employed.<br>
Firstly the heat exchanger was sprayed with the enzymatic cleaner of the present invention<br>
such as described in Examples 1-3 above. The enzymatic cleaner is typically diluted at a<br>
rate of 50 parts water to 1 part enzymatic cleaner for very dirty heat exchangers and up to<br>
100 parts of water to 1 part of enzymatic cleaner for less severely soiled heat exchangers.<br>
The cleaner is allowed to soak into the contaminated surface in order to penetrate and<br>
digest biological matter. The soaking period is typically between 10 and 20 minutes<br>
depending on the depth of soil on the heat exchange surfaces.<br>
Secondly, the heat exchanger was sprayed with low pressure water to remove the digested<br>
contaminants without physical damage to the fins. The digested contaminants were<br>
readily removed as the amount of foam obstruction of the coils was minimal.<br>
This process was in contrast to carrying out the clearing with a conventional enzymatic<br>
preparations which have a propensity to foam copiously during this spraying phase. The<br>
foam suspends contaminant particles and hides from view the areas which require further<br>
spraying.<br>
Therefore the use of a very low foaming or non foaming enzymatic preparation has proved<br>
to be greatly advantageous.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples, the<br>
formulations may be altered to an extent which will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
from the teaching hereof without departing from the scope of the inventive concepts herein<br>
disclosed.<br><br>
