				<td>NOVEL PIPERIPINE-SUBSTITUTED INDOLES- OR HETERODERIVATIVES<br>
THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates generally to piperidine-substituted indoles- or hete^oderivatives thereof and their use as modulators of chemokine receptor activity, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and methods of using the same as agents for treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases such as asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines, of molecular weight 6-15 kDa, that are released by )     a wide variety of cells to attract and activate, among other cell types, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils (reviewed in Luster, New Eng. J Mod., 338, 436-445 (1998) and Rollins, Blood, 90,909-928 (1997)).<br>
There are two major classes of chemokines, CXC and CC, depending on whether the first two cysteines in the amino acid sequence are separated by a single araino acid (CXC) or are adjacent (CC). The CXC chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP2) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA) are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils and T lymphocytes, whereas the CC chemokines, such as RANTES, MlP-la, MEM (3, the monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, and MCP-5) and the eotaxins (-l,-2, and-3) are chemotactic for, among other cell types, macrophages, T lymphocytes, eosinophils, dendritic cells, and basophils. There also exist the chemoldnes lymphotactin-ls lymphotactin-2 (both C chemokines), and fractalkine (a CXXXC chemokine) that do not fall into either of the major chemokine subfamilies.<br>
The chemokines-bind to specific cell-surface receptors belonging to the family of G-protein-coupled seventransmembrane-domain proteins (reviewed in Horuk, Trends Pharm. Sci., 15,159-165 (1994)) which are termed "chemokine receptors." On binding their cognate ligands, chemokine receptors transduce an intracellular signal through the associated trimeric G proteins, resulting in, among other responses, a rapid increase in<br>
intracellular calcium concentration, changes in cell shape, increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, degranulation, and promotion of cell migration. There are at least ten human chemokine receptors that bind or respond to CC chemokines with the following characteristic patterns: CCR1 (or"CKR-l"or"CC-CKR-l") [Mff-la, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES] (Ben-Barruch, et al., Cell, 72,415-425 (1993), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR-2A and CCR-2B (or "CKR-2A"/"CKR-2B"or"CC-CKR-2A"/"CC-CKR-2B")"[MCP-1, MCP2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MCP-5] (Charo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 2752-2756 (1994), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR-3 (or"CKR-3"or"CC-CKR-3") [eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, RANTES, MCP-3, MCP-4] (Combadiere, et al., J. Biol Chem., 270,16491-16494 (1995), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR-4 (or"CKR-4" or"CC-CKR-4") [TARC, Mff-la, RANTES, MCP-1] (Power et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270,19495-19500 (1995), Luster, New Eng. J. Med., 338, 436-445 (1998)); CCR-5 (or"CKR-5"OR"CCCKR-5") [MIP-la,*RANTES, Mff-lp] (Sanson, et al., Biochemistry, 35, 3362-3367 (1996)); CCR-6 (or"CKR-6"or "CC-CKR-6") [LARC] (Baba et al, J. Biol. Chem., 272, 14893-14898 (1997)); CCR-7 (or"CKR-7"or"CC-CKR-7") [ELC] (Yoshie etal., J. Leukoc. Biol. 62, 634-644 (1997)); CCR-8 (or"CKR-8"or"CC-CKR-8") [1-309, TARC, Mff-lp] (Napolitano et al., J. Immunol., 157,2759-2763 (1996), Bernardini et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 28, 582-588 (1998)); and CCR-10 (or"CKR-10"or"CC-CKR-10") [MCP-1, MCP-3] (Bonini et al, DNA and Cell Biol., 16, 1249-1256 (1997)).<br>
In addition to the mammalian chemokine receptors, mammalian cytomegaloviruses, herpes viruses and poxviruses have been shown to express, in infected cells, proteins with the binding properties of chemokine receptors (reviewed by Wells and Schwartz, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 8, 741-748 (1997)). Human CC chemokines, such as RANTES and MCP-3, can cause rapid mobilization of calcium via these virally encoded receptors. Receptor expression may be permissive for infection by allowing for the subversion of normal immune system surveillance and response to infection. Additionally, human chemokine receptors, such as CXCR-4, CCR-2, CCR-3, CCR-5 and CCR-8, can act as coreceptors for the infection of mammalian cells by microbes as with, for example, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV).<br>
Chemokine receptors have been implicated as being important mediators of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. For example, the chemokine receptor CCR-3 plays a pivotal role in attracting eosinophils to sites of allergic inflammation and in subsequently activating these cells. The chemokine ligands for CCR-3 induce a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration, increased expression of cellular adhesion molecules, cellular degranulation, and the promotion of eosinophil migration. Accordingly, agents which modulate<br>
chemokine receptors would be useful in such disorders and diseases. In addition, agents which modulate chemokine receptors would also be useful in infectious diseases such as by blocking infection of CCR-3 expressing cells by HIV or in preventing the manipulation of immune cellular responses by viruses such as cytomegaloviruses.<br>

METHOD OF TREATMENT<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to compounds which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, infection by pathogenic microbes (which, by definition, includes viruses), as well as autoimmune pathologies such as the rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis.<br>
For example, an instant compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian chemokine receptor (e. g., a human chemokine receptor) may be administered to inhibit (i. e., reduce or prevent) inflammation or infectious disease. As a result, one or more inflammatory process, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e. g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited. For example, eosinophilic infiltration to inflammatory sites (e. g., in asthma or allergic rhinitis) can be inhibited according to the present method. In particular, the compound of the following examples has activity in blocking the migration of cells expressing the CCR-3 receptor using the appropriate chemokines in the aforementioned assays.<br>
Similarly, an instant compound which promotes one or more functions of the mammalian   • chemokine receptor (e, g., a human chemokine) as administered to stimulate (induce or enhance) an immune or inflammatory response, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion,<br>
s, exocycosis (e. g., or enzymes, iustamme.) or inflammatory mediator release, resulting in the beneficial stimulation of inflammatory processes. For example, eosinophils can be recruited to combat parasitic infections. In addition, treatment of the aforementioned inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for an instant compound which promotes one or more functions of the mammalian chemokine receptor if one contemplates the delivery of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor intemalization or the delivery of compound in a manner that results in the misdirection of the migration of cells.<br>
*<br>
In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals, including but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murin'e species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as aviah species. The subject treated in the methods above is a mammal, male or female, in whom modulation of chemokine receptor activity is desired. "Modulation" as used herein is intended to encompass antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism and/or partial agonism.<br>
Diseases or conditions of human or other species which can be treated with inhibitors of chemolcine receptor fraction, include, but are not limited to: inflammatory or allergic diseases and conditions, including respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivitypneumonitis, eosinophilic cellulitis (e, g,, Well's syndrome), eosinophilic pneumonias (e. g., Loeffler's syndrome, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), eosinophilic fasciitis (e. g., Shulman's syndrome), delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (e. g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis or dermatomyositis); systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e. g., to penicillin, cephalosporins), eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome due to the ingestion of contaminated tryptophan, insect sting allergies; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, juvenile onset diabetes; glomerulonephritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Behcet's disease; graft rejection (e. g., in transplantation), including allograft rejection or graftversus-host disease; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as'Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; spondyloarthropathies; scleroderma; psoriasis (including TeeII mediated psoriasis) and inflammatory dennatoses such as an dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis (e. g., necrotizing, cutaneous, and hypersensitivity vasculitis); eosinophilic myositis, eosinophilic fasciitis; cancers with leukocyte infiltration of the skin or organs. Other diseases or conditions in which undesirable inflammatory<br>
responses are to be inhibited can be treated, including, but not limited to, reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, certain hematologic malignancies, cytokine-induced toxicity (e. g., septic shock, endotoxic shock), polymyositis, dermatomyositis. Infectious diseases or conditions of human or other species which can be treated with inhibitors of chemokine receptor function, include, but are not limited to, HIV.<br>
Diseases or conditions of humans or other species which can be treated with promoters of chemokine receptor function, include, but are not limited to: immunosuppression, such as that in individuals with immunodeficiency syndromes such as AIDS or other viral infections, individuals undergoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, therapy for autoimmune disease or drug therapy (e. g., corticosteroid therapy), which causes immunosuppression; immunosuppression due to congenital deficiency in receptor function or other causes; and infections diseases, such as parasitic diseases, including, but not limited to helminth infections, such as nematodes (round worms); (Trichuriasis, Enterobiasis, Ascariasis, Hookworm, Strongyloidiasis, Trichinosis, filariasis); trematodes (flukes) (Schistosomiasis, Clonorchiasis), cestodes (tape worms) (Echinococcosis, Taeniasis saginata, Cysticercosis); visceral -worms, visceral larva migraines (e. g., Toxocara), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (e. g., Anisaki sp., Phocanema sp.), cutaneous larva migraines (Ancylostona braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum). The compounds of the present invention are accordingly useful in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases. In addition, treatment of the aforementioned inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for promoters of chemokine receptor function if one contemplates the delivery of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor internalization or delivery of compound in a manner that results in the misdirection of the migration of cells.<br>
In another aspect, the instant invention may be used to evaluate the putative specific agonists or antagonists of a G protein coupled receptor. The present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds that modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e. g., by competitive inhibition or as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness.<br>
Specifically, such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving the aforementioned diseases, The compounds of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the<br>
chemokine receptors. In addition, one could utilize compounds of this invention to examine the specificity of G protein coupled receptors that are not thought to be chemokine receptors, either by serving as examples of compounds which do not bind or as structural variants of compounds active on these receptors which may help define specific sites of interaction.<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL FORMS<br>
The compounds of formula 1 are administered to a mammal in a therapeutically effective amount, By "therapeutically effective amount" it is meant an amount of a compound of formula 1 that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a mammal, is effective to prevent or ameliorate diseases, wherein the activity of a CCR-3-receptor is involved, or the progression of this disease.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. A physician or veterinarian can determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the disorder.<br>
By way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0,001 to 1000 mg/kg of body weight, preferably between about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 1.0 to 20 mg/kg/day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 1 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily.<br><br>
Compounds of this invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of<br>
suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermale routes, using transdermale skin patches.<br>
When administered in the form of a transdermale delivery system, the dosage<br>
administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage<br>
regimen.	.     .<br>
The compounds of formula 1 are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups and the like, and consistent<br>
with conventional pharmaceutical practices.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and colouring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatine, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage form's include sodium, oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and cross linked or amphipathic block copolymers ofhydrogels.<br>
Dosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 100 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit.<br>
In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Gelatine capsules may contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain colouring and flavouring to increase patient acceptance.<br>
In general, water, suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alorie or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl-or propyl-p'araben, and chlorobutanoL<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Reminqton's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field.<br>
Where two or more of the foregoing second therapeutic agents are administered with the compound of formula 1, generally the amount of each component in a typical daily dosage and typical dosage form may be reduced relative to the usual dosage of the agent when<br>
administered alone, in view of the additive or synergistic effect of the therapeutic agents when administered in combination.<br>
Particularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of formula 1 and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but; also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material which effects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients.<br>
Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.<br>
These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.<br><br><br><br><br>
