				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to scroll machines. More particularly, the present invention relates to a scroll machine having a clearance between the scrolls and the Oldham coupling which allows deflection of the keys of the Oldham coupling.<br>
Background and Summary of the Invention<br>
A class of machines exists in the art generally known as scroll machines which are used for the displacement of various types of fluid. The scroll machines can be configured as an expander, a displacement engine, a pump, a compressor etc, and the features of the present invention are applicable to any one of these machines. For purposes of illustration, however, the disclosed embodiment is in the form of a hermetic refrigerant scroll compressor.<br>
Scroll compressors are becoming more and more popular for use as compressors in both refrigeration as well as air conditioning applications due primarily to their capability for extremely efficient operation. Generally, these machines incorporate a pair of intermeshed spiral wraps, one of which is caused to orbit relative to the other so as to define one or more moving chambers which progressively decrease in size as they travel from an outer suction port toward a center discharge port. An electric motor is provided which operates to drive the orbiting scroll member via a suitable drive shaft affixed to the motor rotor, in a hermetic compressor, the bottom of the hermetic shell normally contains an oil sump for lubricating and cooling purposes.<br>
z<br><br>
Relative rotation between the spiral wraps is typically controlled using an Oldham coupling. The Oldham coupling can be keyed to the main bearing housing and the orbiting scroll member, or the Oldham coupling can be keyed to both the orbiting and the non-orbiting scroll members. The keys of the Oldham coupling are slidingiy received within slots of the main bearing housing, the orbiting scroll member or the non-orbiting scroll member. In order to reduce the noise generated during the operation of the scroll compressor, the clearance between the keys of the Oldham coupling and its associated slot should be tightly controlled.<br>
When the clearances between the keys of the Oidham coupling and their associated slots is tightly controlled, binding of the keys within their associated slots can occur during times of heavy loading of the Oidham coupfing. This binding of the keys within the slots causes excessive loading of the keys as well as generating excessive noise.<br>
The present invention provides the art with a scroil compressor which includes an Oldham coupling which has both a tight tolerance fit of the keys of the Oldham coupling in their associated slots while simultaneously providing a tapered or stepped surface which provides a clearance between the key and the slot for allowing deflection of the keys of the Oldham coupling. The tapered or stepped surface can be located on the keys of the Oldham coupling or the tapered or stepped surface can be located on the sides of the slots within which the keys slide.<br>
Other advantages and objects of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the subsequent detailed description, appended claims and drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figures 1 and 2 a scroll compressor incorporating the unique Oldham coupling in accordance with the present invention and which is indicated generally by the reference numeral 10. Scroll compressor 10 comprises a generally cylindrical hermetic shell 12 having welded at the upper end thereof a cap 14 and at the lower end thereof a base 16 having a plurality of mounting feet (not shown) integrally formed therewith. Cap 14 is provided with a refrigerant discharge fitting 18 which may have the usual discharge valve therein. A transversely extending partition 20 is affixed to shell 12 by being welded about its periphery at the same point that cap 14 is welded to shell 12. A compressor mounting frame 22 is press fit within shell 12 and is supported by the end of base 16. Base 18 is slightly smaller in diameter than shell 12 such that base 16 is received within shell 12 and welded about its periphery as shown in Figure 1.<br>
Major elements of compressor 10 that are affixed to frame 22 include a two-piece main bearing housing 24, a lower bearing housing 26 and a motor stator 28. A drive shaft or crankshaft 30 having an eccentric crank pin 32 at the upper end thereof is rotatably journaled in a bearing 34 secured within main bearing housing 24 and a second bearing 36 secured within lower bearing housing 26. Crankshaft 30 has at the lower end thereof a relatively large diameter concentric bore 38 which communicates with a radially outwardly positioned smaller diameter bore 40 extending upwardly therefrom to the top of crankshaft 30. The lower portion of the interior of shell 12 defines an oil sump 44 which is filled with lubricating oil to a level slightly above the lower end of a rotor 46, and bore 38 acts as a pump to pump lubricating fluid up crankshaft 30 and into bore 40 and ultimately to all of the various portions of compressor 10 which require lubrication.<br>
4<br><br>
Crankshaft 30 is rotatably driven by an electric motor which includes stator 28, winding 48 passing therethrough and rotor 46 press fitted on crankshaft 30. An upper counterweight 50 is secured to crankshaft 30 and a lower counterweight 52 is secured to rotor 46.<br>
The upper surface of two-piece main bearing housing 24 is provided with a flat thrust bearing surface 54 on which is disposed an orbiting scroll member 56 having the usual spiral vane or wrap 58 extending upward from an end plate 60. Projecting downwardly from the lower surface of end plate 60 of orbiting scroll member 56 is a cylindrical hub 62 having a journal bearing 64 therein and in which is rotatively disposed a drive bushing 66 having an inner bore in which crank pin 32 is drivingiy disposed. Crank pin 32 has a flat on one surface which drivingiy engages a flat surface formed in a portion of the inner bore of drive bushing 66 to provide a radially compliant driving arrangement, such as shown in assignee's U.S. Letters Patent 4,877,382, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. An Oldham coupling 68 is also provided positioned between orbiting scroll member 56 and two-piece bearing housing 24. Oldham coupling 68 is keyed to orbiting scroll member 56 and to a non-orbiting scroll member 70 to prevent rotational movement of orbiting scroll member 56.<br>
Non-orbiting scroll member 70 is also provided with a wrap 72 extending downwardly from an end plate 74 which is positioned in meshing engagement with wrap 58 of orbiting scroll member 56. Non-orbiting scroll member 70 has a centrally disposed discharge passage 76 which communicates with an upwardly open recess 78 which is in turn in fluid communication with a discharge muffler chamber 80 defined by cap 14 and partition 20. An annular recess 82 is also formed in non-orbiting scroll member 70 within which is disposed a floating seal assembly 84.<br>
Recesses 78 and 82 and floating seal assembly 84 cooperate to define axial pressure biasing chambers which receive pressurized fluid being compressed by wraps 58 and 72 so as to exert an axial biasing force on non-orbiting scroll member 70 to<br>
5<br><br>
thereby urge the tips of respective wraps 58 and 72 into sealing engagement with the opposed end plate surfaces of end plates 74 and 60, respectively. Floating sea! assembly 84 is preferably of the type described in greater detail in assignee's U.S. Patent No. 5,156,539, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Non-orbiting scroll member 70 is designed to be mounted for limited axial movement to two-piece main bearing housing 24 in a suitable manner such as disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,877,382 or assignee's U.S. Patent No. 5,102,316, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>

first and second dimensions.<br><br>
This invention relates to a scroll compressor having a pair of interleaved scrolls (70,56). An Oldham coupling (6,8) is attached to the orbitting scroll (56) to prevent rotation of the orbiting scroll. This Oldham coupling has keys (92,94) that are slidingly received in slots (96,98). One side of each key is loaded (100) while the opposite side is non-loaded (102). The non-loaded side (102) of the key (52,94) has a stepped (102) or profiled surface (202) to provide clearance (104,106) to allow deflection of the key. In another embodiment, the stepped or profiled surface is provided on the non-loaded side of the slot.</td>
