DESCRIPTION<br>
ENCODING DEVICE, DECODING DEVICE, AND METHOD THEREOF<br>
5  Technical Field<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a coding apparatus and decoding apparatus that codes/decodes a speech signal, audio signal and the like, and methods thereof.<br>
10  Background Art<br>
[0002]  A speech coding technology that compresses a speech signal at a low bit rate is important for efficiently using a radio wave etc . in mobile communication .  Further, in recent years, expectation for improvement of quality<br>
15 	of communication speech has been increased, and it is desired to implement communication services with high realistic quality. Here, realistic quality means the sound environment surrounding the speaker (for example, BGM) , and it is preferable that signals other than a speech<br>
20  signal such as audio can be coded with high quality. [0003]  There are schemes such as G726 and G729 defined in  ITU-T   (International  Telecommunication  Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector) for speech coding of coding speech signals .  In these schemes , coding<br>
25 is carried out at 8kbit/s to 32kbit/s targeting a narrow band signal (300Hz to 3.4kHz). Though these schemes are capable of coding at a low bit rate, since the targeted<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	3<br>
narrow band signal is narrow up to a maximum of 3.4kHz, this quality tends to lack realistic quality.<br>
[0004]  Further, in ITU-T and 3GPP (The 3rd Generation Partnership Project) , there are standard schemes of speech<br>
5 	coding with signal band of 50Hz to 7kHz (G.722, G. 722.1, AMR-WB, and the like). Though these schemes are capable of coding a wideband speech signal at a bit rate of 6 . 6kbit/s to 64kbit/s, it is necessary to increase bit rates relatively for coding wideband speech with high quality.<br>
10	From the viewpoint of speech quality, wideband speech is high quality compared to narrow band speech, but it is difficult to say that this is sufficient for services requiring high realistic quality. <br>
[0005]  Typically, when maximum frequency of a signal<br>
15 is 10 to 15kHz, realistic quality equivalent to FM radio quality can be obtained, and, when maximum frequency is 20kHz, quality equivalent to CD can be obtained. Audio coding such as a layer 3 scheme or AAC scheme defined by MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group) is suitable for<br>
20 	a signal having such band. However, when these audio coding schemes are applied as a coding scheme for speech communication, it is necessary to set a high bit rate in order to code speech with good quality. There are also other problems such as a problem that a coding delay<br>
25  becomes substantial.<br>
[0.006]  As a method of coding a signal with wide frequency band at a low bitrate with high quality, there is a technology<br><br>
      2F05047-PCT	4<br>
	for reducing overall bit rate by dividing the spectrum of an input signal into low frequency band and high frequency band to obtain two spectrums, duplicating the low frequency band spectrum and substituting the low frequency band<br>
5	spectrum for the high frequency band spectrum (using the low frequency band spectrum in place of the high frequency band spectrum) (for example, refer to Patent Document 1). In this technology, a large number of bits are allocated for coding of the low frequency band spectrum, and coding<br>
10	is performed with high quality, while on the other hand, the high frequency band spectrum duplicates the coded low frequency band spectrum as basic processing, and coding is performed with a small number of bits. <br>
	[0007] Further, as a technology similar to this technology, <br>
15	there are a technology of improving quality by performing approximation on band where coded bits cannot be sufficiently allocated using other predetermined partial band spectrum information (for example, refer to Patent Document2), and a technology of duplicating a low frequency <br>
20	band spectrum of a narrow band signal as a high frequency band spectrum as basic processing .in order to extend band of a narrow band signal to a wideband signal without additional information (for example, refer to Patent Document 3).<br>
25	[0008] In either technology, another band spectrum 	is duplicated for band where it is wished to 	compensate a spectrum, and after gain is adjusted to 	smooth the spectrum<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	5<br>
	envelope, this duplicated spectrum is inserted.<br>

	No.2001-521648.<br>

	No.HEI9-90992.<br>
10	Disclosure of Invention<br>
	Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
	[0009] However, in a spectrum of a speech signal or 	audio signal, the phenomena can be often seen where the 	dynamic range (ratio between the maximum value and 	minimum value <br>
15	of the absolute value of the spectral amplitude 	(absolute amplitude)) of the low frequency band 	spectrum is larger than the dynamic range of the high 	frequency band spectrum. FIG.l illustrates this 	phenomena and shows an example of a spectrum for an 	audio signal. This spectrum is a<br>
20 	log spectrum in the case where an audio signal with 	sampling frequency of 32kHz is subjected to frequency 	analysis for 30ms.<br>
	[0010] As shown in this drawing, a low frequency band 	spectrum with frequency of 0 to 8000Hz has strong peak 25	performance (a large number of sharp peaks exist) , and 	the dynamic range of the spectrum at this band becomes 	large.  On the other hand, the dynamic range of the 	high<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	6<br>
	frequency band spectrum with frequency of 8000 to 15000Hz becomes small. With the conventional method of duplicating the low frequency band spectrum as a high frequency band spectrum, even if gain adjustment of the<br>
5  	high frequency band spectrum is performed on a signal   <br>
    having such a spectrum characteristic, unnecessary peak<br>
shapes appear in the high frequency band spectrum as shown<br>
below.<br>
  [0011]  FIG.2 shows the entire band spectrum in the case<br>
10	where a high frequency band spectrum (10000 to 16000Hz)                     is obtained by duplicating a low frequency band spectrum (1000to7000Hz) of the spectrum shown in FIG.l and adjusting energy. <br>
   [0012]  When the above - described processing is carried<br>
15 	out, as shown in this drawing, unnecessary peak shapes appear in band Rl of 10000Hz or above. These peaks are not found in the original high frequency band spectrum. In a decoded signal obtained by converting this spectrum to a time domain, a problem arises that noise that sounds<br>
20 	like a bell ringing occurs and the subjective quality therefore deteriorates. In this way, with technology where a. spectrum of another band is substituted for a spectrum of given band, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the dynamic range of the inserted spectrum.<br>
25 	[0013] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a coding apparatus, decoding apparatus, and methods for these apparatuses capable of appropriately<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	7<br>
adjusting dynamic range of an inserted spectrum and increasing the subjective quality of the decoded signal in a technology for substituting (replacing) a spectrum of another band for a spectrum of given band.<br>
5<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0014] A coding apparatus of the present invention adopts a configuration having: a coding section that codes a high frequency band spectrum of an input signal; and a<br>
10 	limiting section that generates a second low frequency band spectrum in which amplitude of a first low frequency band spectrum that is a decoded signal of a coded low frequency band spectrum of the inputted signal is uniformly limited, wherein the coding section codes the high<br>
15 	frequency band spectrum based on the second low frequency band spectrum.<br>
[0015] A decoding apparatus of the present invention adopts a configuration having: a converting section that generates a first low frequency band spectrum in which<br>
20 	a decoded signal of code of a low frequency band spectrum included in code generated in the coding apparatus is converted to a signal of a frequency domain; a decoding section that decodes code of a high frequency band spectrum included in the code generated in the coding apparatus;<br>
25 	and a limiting section that generates a second low frequency band spectrum in which amplitude of the first low frequency band spectrum is uniformly limited according to spectrum<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	8<br>
	modification information included in the code generated in the coding apparatus, wherein, the decoding section decodes the high frequency band spectrum based on the second low frequency band spectrum.<br>
5	[0016] Further, the decoding apparatus of the 	present invention adopts a configuration having: a 	converting section th at generates a first low 	frequency band spectrum in which a decoded signal of 	code of a low frequency band spectrum generated in 	the coding apparatus is converted <br>
10	to a signal of a frequency domain; a decoding section that decodes code of a high frequency band spectrum included in the code generated in the coding apparatus, and a limiting section that generates a second low frequency band spectrum in which amplitude of the first low frequency band spectrum <br>
15	is uniformly limited, wherein: the limiting section estimates information about the way of limiting based on the first low frequency band spectrum and generates the second low frequency band spectrum using the estimated information; and the decoding section decodes the high<br>
20	frequency band spectrum based on the second low frequency band spectrum.<br><br>
Advantageous Effect of the Invention<br>
[0017] According to the present invention,in a technology <br>
25	of substituting a spectrum of another band for a spectrum of given band, it is possible to appropriately adjust the dynamic range of the inserted spectrum and improve<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	9<br>
the subjective quality of the decoded signal.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention <br>
5  	[0019]  Embodiments of the present invention explained  below  in  detail  with  reference accompanying drawings.<br>
[0020]  (Embodiment 1)<br>
10 		FIG.3 is a block diagram showing the main configuration of hierarchical coding apparatus 100 according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. Here , a case will be explained as an example where coding information has a hierarchical structure made up of a<br>
15 		plurality of layers, that is, hierarchical coding (scalable coding) is performed.<br>
[0021] Each part of hierarchical coding apparatus 100 carries out the following operation in accordance with input of the signal.<br>
20 		[0022] Down-sampling section 10 1 generates a signal with a low sampling rate from the input signal and supplies this signal to first layer coding section 102. First layer coding section 102 codes the signal outputted from down-sampling section 101.  Coded code obtained at first<br>
25 		layer coding section 102 is supplied to multiplex section 103 and to first layer decoding section 104. First layer decoding section 104 then generates first layer decoding<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	13<br>
signal SI from the coded code outputted from first layer coding section 102.<br>
[0023] On the other hand, delay section 105 gives a delay of a predetermined length to the input signal. This delay<br>
5 	is for correcting a time delay occurring at down-sampling section 101, first layer coding section 102 and first layer decoding section 104. Spectrum coding section 106 performs spectrum coding on input signal S2 delayed by a predetermined time and outputted from delay section<br>
10 	105, using first layer decoding signal SI generated at first layer decoding section 104, and outputs the generated coded code to multiplex section 103.<br>
[0024]  Multiplex section 103 then multiplexes the coded code obtained at first layer coding section 102 with the<br>
15 	coded code obtained at spectrum coding section 106 and outputs the result to outside of coding apparatus 100 as output coded code.<br>
[0025] FIG.4 is a block diagram showing the main configuration of the internal part of the above-de scribed<br>
20   spectrum coding section 106.<br>
[0026]   This spectrum coding section 106  is mainly configured with frequency domain converting section 111, spectrum modification section 112,  frequency domain converting section 113, extension frequency band spectrum<br>
25  coding section 114 and multiplex section 115.<br>
[0027]  Spectrum coding section 106 receives first, signal Sl with valid signal band of O<k k is the frequency></k><br>
2F05047-PCT	14<br>
from first layer decoding section 104, and second signal S2 with valid signal band of 0<k fl fh from delay section . spectrum coding estimates a with band of second signal s2 using></k>
5  	a spectrum with band of 0<k of signal s1 and codes outputs this estimation information.></k>
[0028]  Frequency domain converting section 111 performs frequency conversion on inputted first signal SI and calculates first spectrum S1 (k) that is a low frequency<br>
10 band spectrum. On the other hand, frequency domain converting section 113 performs frequency conversion on inputted second signal S2 , and calculates wideband second spectrum S2 (k) .  Here, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) , Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) , Modified Discrete Cosine<br>
15	 Transform (MDCT) , or the like, is applied as the method     of frequency conversion.  Further, Sl(k) is a spectrum with frequency k of the first spectrum, and S2(k) is a spectrum with frequency k of the second spectrum. <br>
[0029]  Spectrum modification section 112 investigates<br>
20  a way of modifying so as to obtain an appropriate dynamic range by changing the dynamic range of the first spectrum by variously modifying first spectrum S1(k).  Information about this modification (modification information) is coded and supplied to multiplex section 115.  This spectrum<br>
25 modification processing is described in detail later. Further, spectrum modification section 112 outputs first spectrum S1(k) having an appropriate dynamic range to<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	15<br>
extension frequency band spectrum coding section 114. [0030] Extension frequency band spectrum coding section 114 estimates a spectrum (extension frequency, band spectrum) which should be included in high frequency band<br>
5 	(FL<k of first spectrum sl using second s2 as a reference signal codes information about this estimated and supplies to multiplex section here estimation an extension frequency band is carried out based on></k>
10  spectrum after modification SI' (k) .<br>
[0031] Multiplex section 115 then multiplexes and outputs coded code of the modification information outputted from spectrum modification section 112 and coded code of estimation information about the extension frequency band<br>
15 spectrum outputted from extension frequency band spectrum coding section 114.<br>
[0032] FIG.5 is a block diagram showing the main configuration of internal part of the above-described spectrum modification section 112.<br>
20 [0033] Spectrum modification section 112 applies the modification so that the dynamic range of first spectrum Sl(k) becomes the closest to the dynamic range of the high frequency band spectrum FL<k of second spectrum s2 . the modification information at this time is then></k>
25  coded and outputted.<br>
[0034] Buffer 121 temporarily stores the inputted first spectrum S1(k), and supplies first spectrum S1(k) to<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	16<br>
modification section 122 as necessary. [0 03 5] Modification section 12 2 then variously modifies first spectrum S1(k) in accordance with the procedure described below so as to generate modified first spectrum<br>
5	S1’ (j ,  k) ,  and this is supplied to subband energy calculating section 123.  Here, j is an index for identifying each modification processing. <br>
[0036]  Subband energy calculating section 123 then divides the frequency band of modified first spectrum<br>
10 	S ‘ (j, k) into a plurality of subbands , and obtains subband energy (subband energy) of a predetermined range. For example, when a range for obtaining subband energy is determined as FlL<k the subband width bsw in case where this bandwidth is divided into n expressed></k>
15  by the following (equation 1).<br>
BWS=(F1H-F1L+1)/N      (Equation 1)<br>
As a result, minimum frequency FlL(n) of the nth <br>
20  	subband and maximum frequency FlH(n)  are expressed         respectively by (equation 2) and (equation 3).<br>
F1L(n) =FlL + n BWS      (Equation 2)<br>
25	F1H(n)=F1L+(n+1)BWS-1      (Equation 3)<br>
where n is a value from 0 to N-l.<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	17<br>
At this time, subband energy P1 ( j, n) is calculated as shown in the following (Equation 4) .<br><br>
Further, this may also be obtained as an average value of a spectrum included in the subband as shown in (Equation 5) below.<br><br>
Subband energy PI (j , n) obtained in this way is then supplied to variance calculating section 124. <br>
[0037] Variance calculating section 124 calculates<br>
15 	variance al2(j) in accordance with (equation 6) below in order to indicate the degree of variation of subband energy P1(j , n) .<br><br>
Here, Plmean(j)indicates the average value of subband energy Pl(j, n) and is calculated from (Equation<br><br><br>
5			Variance ol2(j ) indicating the degree of variation of subband energy in the modification information j calculated in this way is then supplied to search section 125 . <br>
	[0038]  As with a series of processing carried out at<br>

10 	[0051] The specific method of applying modification to the first spectrum is to divide the first spectrum into subbands, obtain average of absolute amplitude of the spectrum (subband average amplitude) included in each subband, and modify the first spectrum so that variance<br>
15 	obtained by performing statistical processing on these subband average amplitudes becomes the closet to variance of average amplitude of the subband obtained in the similar way from the spectrum of the high frequency band of the second spectrum.  Namely, the first spectrum is modified<br>
20 	so that the average deviation of the absolute amplitude of the first spectrum and the average deviation of the absolute amplitude of the high frequency band spectrum of the second spectrum have the similar value. Further, modification  information  indicating  this  specific<br>
25 	modification method is coded. It is also possible to use energy of the spectrum included in each subband instead of the average amplitude of the subband.<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	23<br>
[0052] Further detail of the specific modification method is to raise the spectrum of the first spectrum to the power of a (α
5 	Information about used a is transmitted to the decoding side .<br>
[0053] By adopting the above - described configuration, even in the case where the dynamic range of the first spectrum is substantially different from the dynamic range of the high frequency band of the second spectrum, it is possible to appropriately adjust the dynamic range<br>
10	of the estimated spectrum and improve the subjective quality of the decoded signal.<br>
[0054] Further, in the above configuration, by raising <br>
15	the entire first spectrum to the power of a (α
20 	of a predetermined value or more, the spectrum may be discontinuous and generate a strange noise. However, by adopting the above - described configuration, it is possible to keep the spectrum smooth and prevent the occurrence of a strange noise.<br>
25	[0055] In this embodiment, a case has been described as an example where variance is used as an index indicating the degree of variation (deviation) of the absolute<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	24<br>
amplitude of the spectrum, but this is by no means limiting, and, another index such as standard deviation, for example, may be also applied.<br>
[0056]  In this embodiment, a case has been described <br>
5	as an example where an exponential function is used in modification section 122 (or modification section 128) within coding apparatus 100, but it is also possible to use the method shown below.<br>

10	of another variation (modification section 122a) of the modification section. Components that are identical with modification section 122 (or modification section 128) will be assigned the same reference numerals without further explanations.<br>
15	[0058]  At the above - described modification section 122	(or modification section 128) , the amount of calculation tends to increase since the exponential function is used. Therefore, increase of the amount of calculation is avoided by changing the dynamic range of the spectrum without<br>

In Embodiment 2 of the present invention, a second spectrum is estimated using a pitch filter having a first spectrum as an internal state, and the characteristics<br>

Here, T expresses a coefficient supplied from lag<br>

In this method, filter coefficient β is determined after optimum lag coefficient T is calculated. Here,<br>

[0086]  In this embodiment, a case will be described where<br>
this spectrum outline information is expressed with<br>
spectral power for each subband. At this time, spectral<br>
power of the jth subband is expressed by the following<br>
5  (Equation 17) .<br><br>
Here, BL(j) indicates the minimum frequency of the<br>
10  	jth subband, and BH (j) indicates the maximum frequency<br>
of the jth subband.  Spectral power of the subband of<br>
the second spectrum obtained in this way is then regarded<br>
as spectrum outline information of the second spectrum.<br>
[0087]  Similarly, spectrum outline coding section 208<br>
15  	calculates spectral power B' (j) of the subband of<br>
 estimation value S2' (k)  of the second spectrum in<br>
  	accordance  with  the  following  (Equation  18),  and<br>
calculates the amount of fluctuation V(j) for each subband in accordance with the following (Equation 19).<br>

2F05047--PCT	35<br>
Next, spectrum outline coding section 208 codes the amount of fluctuation V(j) and transmits this code to multiplex section 115. <br>

5  modification  information  obtained  from  spectrum modification section 112, information of optimum lag coefficient Tmax obtained from search section 205, information of the filter coefficient obtained from filter coefficient calculating section 207, and information of<br>
10 the spectrum out line adjustment coefficient obtained-from spectrum out line coding section 2 08 and outputs the result. [0089] According to this embodiment, the second spectrum is estimated using a pitch filter having the first spectrum as an internal state, and therefore it is only necessary<br>
15  to code only the characteristic of this pitch filter, so that a low bit rate can be realized. [0090]  In this embodiment, a case has been described where a frequency domain converting section is provided, but this is a component necessary when a time domain signal<br>
20 is used as input, and the frequency domain converting section is not necessary when the spectrum is directly inputted.<br>
[0091]  Further, in this embodiment, a case has been described as an example where M = l in the above-described<br>
25 (Equation 13), but the value of M is not limited to 1, and it is possible to use integers of 0 or more. [0092]  Moreover, in this embodiment, a case has been<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	36<br>
described as an example where the pitch filter uses a filter function(transfer function)in the above described (Equation 13) , but the pitch filter may also be a first order pitch filter.<br>

 10  further explanations.<br>
[0094] The filter used at filtering section 204 may be simplified as shown in the following (Equation 20).<br><br>
This equation is a filter function for the case where M=0 and β in the above-described (Equation 13). EstimationvalueS2' ' (k) of the second spectrum generated by this filter can be obtained by sequentially copying <br>
20 	a low frequency band spectrum with internal state S(k) separated by just T using the following (Equation 21).<br><br>
25   [0095]  Further search section 205 determines optimum coefficient Tmax by searching lag coefficient T that makes<br><br>
2P05047-PCT	37<br>
the above-described (Equationl5) a minimum. Coefficient Tmax obtained in this way is then supplied to multiplex section 115.<br>
[0096] By adopting the above - described configuration,<br>
5 	the configuration of the filter used at filtering section 2 04 is simple, and filter coefficient calculating section 207 is unnecessary, so that it is possible to estimate the second spectrum with a small amount of calculation. According to this configuration, the configuration of<br>
10  the coding apparatus is simplified, and the amount of calculation in coding processing can be reduced. [0097]  Next, a configuration of spectrum decoding section 251 on the decoding side capable of decoding coded code generated at the above-described spectrum coding section<br>

[0100] Filtering section 253 obtains information relating to the filter via separating section 161 from <br>
5	the coded code generated at spectrum coding section 201<br>
(201a) on the coding side. Specifically, in the case of spectrum coding section 201, lag coefficient Tmax and filter coefficient (J,-! are obtained, and in the case of spectrum coding section 201a, only lag coefficient Tmax <br>
10	is obtained. Filtering section 253 then carries out filtering based on obtained filter information using modified first spectrum SI' (k) generated at modification section 162 as internal state S(k) of the filter, and calculates decoded spectrum S' ' (k) . This filtering <br>
15 	method depends on the filter function used in spectrum coding section 201(201a) on the coding side, and in the case of spectrum coding section 201, filtering is also carried out on the decoding side in accordance with the above-described (Equation 13) , while in the case of <br>
20 	spectrum coding section 201a, filtering is also carried out on the decoding side in accordance with the above - described (Equation 20) .<br>
[0101] Spectrum outline decoding section 254 decodes spectrum out line information based on the spectrum out line 25information supplied from separating section 161. In this embodiment, a case will be described as an example where quantizing value Vq (j ) of the amount of fluctuation<br><br>

 (Equation<br><br>
Here, BL(j) and BH(j) indicate the minimum frequency <br>
15  	and maximum frequency of the jth subband respectively.<br>
Estimation value S2' ' (k) calculated in accordance with the above-described (Equation 22) is supplied to spectrum configuration section 165.<br>

[0107] Therefore, in the Embodiment 3, instead of spectrum modification section 112, dynamic range calculating section 3 02, modification information estimating section<br>
10 	303 , and modification section 3 04 that modifies the first spectrum based on this estimated modification information are provided. In addition, since modification information can be obtained by estimation inside the spectrum coding section and spectrum decoding section<br>
15 described later, it is not necessary to output modification information as coded code from spectrum coding section 301, and therefore multiplex section 115 provided at spectrum coding section 106 inFIG.4 is no longer necessary. [0108] First spectrum Sl(k)  is then outputted from<br>

5  	it is possible to appropriately adjust the dynamic range of the estimated spectrum with periodicity of an input signal taken into consideration, and improve subjective quality of the decoded signal.<br>
[0128] It is also possible to adopt a configuration of<br>

In Embodiment 5 of the present invention, estimated modification information outputted to the modification section within the spectrum coding section is determined<br>
20 based on LPC coefficients supplied from the first layer coding section.<br>
[0131] The configuration of the hierarchical coding apparatus according to Embodiment 5 is the same as the above-described FIG.18.  However, a parameter outputted<br>
25  from first layer coding section 402 to spectrum coding section 406 is not pitch gain but LPC coefficients. [0132] The main configuration of spectrum coding section<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	52<br>
406 according to this embodiment is as shown in FIG.22. The difference from the above-described FIG.19 is that the parameter supplied to modification information estimating section 511 is not pitch gain but LPC <br>

15 	information are recorded in modification information table 514. However, candidates for estimated modification information designed for LPC coefficients are applied. Candidates for the LPC coefficients are stored in determination table 512, and determination table 512<br>
20 corresponds to modification information table 514. Namely, when a jth candidate for the LPC coefficients is selected from determination table 512, estimated modification information suitable for this candidate for LPC coefficients is stored in jth of modification<br>

[0137] Next, the configuration of the hierarchical decoding apparatus capable of decoding the coded code<br>

[0138] The configuration of the hierarchical decoding apparatus according to Embodiment 5 is the same as the above-described FIG.20 . However, a parameter outputted <br>
10 	from first layer decoding section 4 52 to spectrum decoding section 453 is not pitch gain but LPC coefficients.<br>
[0139] The main configuration of spectrum decoding section 453 according to this embodiment is as shown in FIG.24. The difference from the above-described FIG.21 <br>
15 is that the parameter supplied to modification information estimating section 561 is not pitch gain but LPC coefficients, and it is the internal configuration of modification information estimating section 561.<br>
[0140] The internal configuration of modification <br>
20 	information estimating section 561 is the same as modification information estimating section 511 within spectrum coding section 406 in FIG.22, that is, the same as shown in FIG. 23, and information recorded in determination table 512 and modification information table <br>
25 	514 is common between the coding side and decoding side.<br>
[0141] According to the decoding apparatus (spectrum 	decoding section 453) of this embodiment, by decoding<br><br>

a signal coded at the coding apparatus of this embodiment, it is possible to appropriately adjust the dynamic' range of the estimated spectrum with the spectrum outline of the input signal also taken into consideration, and improve<br>

[0143]  (Embodiment 6)<br>
The basic configuration of the hierarchical coding <br>
5 	apparatus according to Embodiment 6 of the present invention is the same as the hierarchical coding apparatus shown in Embodiment 1, and therefore explanations will be omitted, and just spectrum modification section 612 with a different configuration from spectrum modification<br>
 10	section 112 will be described below.<br>
[0144] Spectrum modification section 612 applies the following modification to first spectrum Sl(k) so that the dynamic range of first spectrum SI (k) [0<k becomes close to the dynamic range of a high frequency band></k>
15	second spectrum S2(k) [FL<k . spectrum modification section then codes and outputs the information about this modification.></k>
[0145] FIG.25 illustrates a spectrum modification method according to this embodiment.<br>
20	[0146] This drawing shows amplitude distribution of first spectrum SI (k). First spectrum SI (k) indicates amplitude differing according to values of frequency k [0<k here when the horizontal axis is taken as amplitude and vertical appearing probability at></k>
25	this amplitude, a distribution similar to normal distribution shown in the drawing appears centered on average value ml of the amplitude.<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	57<br>
[0147] In this embodiment, first, this distribution can be roughly divided into a group (region B in the drawing) close to average value ml and a group (region A in the drawing) far from average value ml. Next, typical values<br>
5 	of amplitude of these two groups, specifically, an average value of spectral amplitude included in region A and an average value of spectral amplitude included in region B, are obtained. Here, the absolute value of amplitude for the case where average value ml is re-converted to<br>
10 	zero (average value ml is subtracted from each value) is used. For example, region A is made up of two regions of a region where amplitude is greater than average value ml and a region where amplitude is smaller than average value ml, but by re-converting average value ml to zero,<br>
15  the absolute values of spectral amplitude included in the two regions have the same value. Accordingly, in the case of the average value of region A, for example, this corresponds to obtaining a typical value of amplitude of this group with a spectrum in which converted amplitude<br>
20 	(absolute value) is relatively large out of the first spectrum taken as one group, and in the case of the average value of region B, this corresponds to obtaining a typical value of amplitude of this group with a spectrum in which converted amplitude is relatively small out of the first<br>
25	spectrum taken as one group. As a result, these two typical values are parameters expressing an outline of the dynamic range of the first spectrum.<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	58<br>
[0148] Next, in this embodiment, the same processing as carried out on the first spectrum is carried out on the second spectrum, and typical values corresponding to the respective groups of the second spectrum are obtained <br>
5	 A ratio between the typical value of the first spectrum and the typical value of the second spectrum in region A (specifically, a ratio of the typical value of the first spectrum to the typical value of the second spectrum) and a ratio between the typical value of the first spectrum<br>
10 	and the typical value of the second spectrum in region B, are obtained. It is therefore possible to approximately obtain the ratio between the dynamic range of the first spectrum and the dynamic range of the second spectrum. The spectrum modification section according to this<br>
15  embodiment codes this ratio as spectrum modification information and outputs this information.<br>
[0149]  FIG.26 is a block diagram showing the main configuration  of  the  internal  part  or  spectrum modification section 612.<br>
20 	[0150] Spectrum modification section 612 can be roughly classified into: a system that calculates typical values of the above-described respective groups of the first spectrum; a system that calculates typical values of the above-described respective groups of the second spectrum;<br>
25 	modification information determining section 626 that determines modification information based on the typical values calculated by these two systems; and modified<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	59<br>
spectrum generating section 62 7 that generates a modified spectrum based on this modification information. [0151]  Specifically, the system that calculates, the typical values of the first spectrum is made up of :'variation<br>
5 		degree calculating section 621-1; first threshold value setting section 622-1; second threshold value setting section 623 - 1; first average spectrum calculating section 624-1; and second average spectrum calculating section 625-1.  The system that calculates the typical values<br>
10 		of the second spectrum has also basically the same configuration as the system that calculates the typical values of the first spectrum. The same components in the drawings will be assigned the same reference numerals , and differences of the processing system are indicated<br>
15 with branch numbers after the reference numerals. Explanations about the same components will be omitted. [0152] Variation degree calculating section 621-1 calculates "variation degree" from average value ml of the first spectrum from amplitude distribution of inputted<br>
20 		first spectrum SI (k), and outputs this to first threshold value setting section 622-1 and second threshold value setting sect-ion 6.23 - 1. Specifically, "variation degree" is standard deviation a of the amplitude distribution of the first spectrum.<br>
25 		[0153] First threshold value setting section 622-1 obtains first threshold value TH1 using first spectrum standard "deviation a obtained at variation degree<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	60<br>
calculating section 621-1. Here, first threshold value TH1 is a threshold value for specifying a spectrum with relatively large absolute amplitude included in the above-described region A out of the first spectrum, and<br>
5 	a value where a predetermined constant a is multiplied by standard deviation or is used.<br>
[0154] The operation of second threshold value setting section 623-1 is also the same as the operation of first threshold value setting section 622-1, but obtained second<br>
10 	threshold value TH2 is a threshold value for specifying a -spectrum with relatively small absolute amplitude included in region B out of the first spectrum, and a value where predetermined constant b (<a is multiplied by standard deviation used.></a>
15 		[0155] First average spectrum calculating sect ion 624 - 1 obtains a spectrum positioned on the outside of first threshold value THl--an average value of amplitude of a spectrum included in region A (hereinafter referred to as a first average value)--and outputs the result to<br>
20  	modification information determining section 626.<br>
[0156]  Specifically, first average spectrum calculating sect ion 624 - 1 compares the amplitude (here, a value before conversion) of the first spectrum with a value (ml + TH1) where first threshold value TH1 is added to average value<br>
25 	ml of the first spectrum, and specifies a spectrum, having larger amplitude than this value (step 1). Next,, first average spectrum calculating section 624-1 compares the<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	61<br>
amplitude of the first spectrum with a value (ml - TH1) where first threshold value TH1 is subtracted from average value ml of the first spectrum, and specifies a spectrum having, smaller amplitude than this value (step 2) .  The<br>
5  amplitudes of the spectrums obtained in both step 1 and step 2 are converted so that the above-described average value ml becomes zero, and the average values of the absolute values of the obtained converted values are calculated, and outputted to modification information determining<br>
10  section 626.<br>
[0157] The second average spectrum calculating section obtains a spectrum positioned on the inside of second threshold value TH2--an average value of amplitude of the spectrum included in region B (hereinafter referred<br>
15  to as second average value)--and outputs the result to modification information determining section 626.  The specific operation is the same as first average spectrum<br>
calculating section 624-1.<br>
[0158]  First average value and second average value<br>
20 	obtained in the above-described processing are typical values for region A and region B of the first spectrum. [0159] Processing for obtaining typical values of the second spectrum is basically the same as described above. However, the first spectrum and the second spectrum are<br>
25 	different spectrums. A value where standard deviation a of the second spectrum is multiplied by predetermined constant c is then used as third threshold value TH3<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	62<br>
corresponding to first threshold value TH1, and a value where standard deviation o\ ■ of the second spectrum is multiplied by predetermined constant d (<c is used as fourth threshold value th4 corresponding to second></c>

[0160] Modification information determining section 626 determines modification information as below using the first average value obtained at first average spectrum calculating section 624-1, the second average value <br>
10 	obtained at second average spectrum calculating section 625-1, the third average value obtained at third average spectrum calculating section 624-2 and the fourth average value obtained at fourth average spectrum calculating section 625-2 .<br>
15	[0161] Namely, modification information determining section 626 calculates a ratio between the first average value and the third average value (hereinafter referred to as first gain), and a ratio between the second average value and the fourth average value (hereinafter referred <br>
20	to as second gain). Modification information determining section 626 is internally provided with a data table in which a plurality of coding candidates for modification information are stored. Modification information determining section 626 then compares the first gain and <br>
25		second gain with these coding candidates, selects the most similar coding candidate, and outputs an index indicating  this  coding  candidate  as  modification<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	63<br>
information.  This index is also transmitted to modified spectrum generating section 627.<br>
[0162] Modified spectrum generating section 627 carries out modification of the first spectrum using the first<br>

[0163] FIG.27 and FIG.28 illustrate a method of generating a modified spectrum.<br>
[0164] Modified spectrum generating section 627 generates a decoded value of a ratio between the first<br>

20  corresponding relationships are as shown in FIG.27.<br>
[0165] Next, modified spectrum generating section 627 specifies spectrums belonging to region A by comparing the first spectral amplitude value with first threshold value TH1, and multiplies the decoded first gain by these<br>
25 spectrums. Similarly, modified spectrum generating section 627 specifies spectrums belonging to region B by comparing the first spectrum amplitude value with second<br><br>

threshold value TH2 , and multiplies the decoded second gain by these spectrums,<br>
[0166] On the other hand, as shown in FIG.28, coding information does not exist for spectrums belonging to<br>
5 	a region (hereinafter, region C) between first threshold value THl and second threshold value TH2 , out of the first spectrum . Modified spectrum generating section 62 7 uses gain having a value midway between the decoded first gain and the decoded second gain. For example, decoded gain <br>
10	y corresponding to given amplitude x may be obtained from a characteristic curve based on the decoded first gain, decoded second gain, first threshold value THl and second threshold value TH2, and the amplitude of the first spectrum may be multiplied by this gain. Namely, decoded gain <br>
15 	y is a linear interpolation value for the decoded first gain and decoded second gain.<br>
[0167] FIG.29 is a block diagram showing the main configuration of the internal part of spectrum modification section 662 used in the decoding apparatus.<br>
20	This spectrum modification section 662 corresponds to modification section 162 shown in Embodiment 1. [0168] The basic operation is the same as the above-described spectrum modification section 612, and therefore detailed explanations will be omitted, but this <br>
25 	spectrum modification section 662 only takes the first spectrum as a processing target, and therefore there is only one processing system.<br><br>
	2F05047--PCT	65<br>
[0169] According to this embodiment, amplitude distribution of the first spectrum and amplitude distribution of the second spectrum are respectively obtained, and divided into a group of relatively large<br>
 5 	absolute amplitude and a group of relatively small absolute amplitude. Then, typical values of the amplitudes for respective groups are obtained. The ratio of the dynamic range between the first spectrum and the second spectrum--modification information of the spectrum—is<br>
10 	obtained and coded using the ratio of the typical values of amplitudes for the respective groups of the first spectrum and the second spectrum. As a result, it is possible to obtain modification information without using a function with a large amount of calculation such as <br>
15 	an exponential function.<br>
[0170] According to this embodiment, standard deviation is obtained from amplitude distribution of the first spectrum and second spectrum, and the first threshold value to the fourth threshold value are obtained based <br>
20 	on this standard deviation. A threshold value is set based on the actual spectrum, so that it is possible to improve coding accuracy of modification information. [0171] ' Further, according to this embodiment, the dynamic range of the first spectrum is controlled by adjusting <br>
25	the gain of the first spectrum using the decoded first gain and decoded second gain. The decoded first gain and decoded second gain are determined so that the first<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	66<br>
spectrum is close to the high frequency band of the second spectrum. The dynamic range of the first spectrum is then close to the dynamic range of the high frequency band of the second spectrum. Further, it is not necessary<br>
5 	to use a function with a large amount of calculation such as an exponential function for calculation of the decoded first gain and decoded second gain.<br>
[0172]  In this embodiment, a case has been described as an example where the decoded first gain is larger than<br>
10 	the decoded second gain, but there are cases where the decoded second gain is larger than the decoded first gain depending on the quality of the speech signal. Namely, there are cases where the dynamic range of the high frequency band of the second spectrum is larger than the dynamic<br>
15 	range of the first spectrum. This kind of phenomena frequently occurs in the cases where the inputted speech signal is a sound such as a fricative. In this case also, it is possible to apply the spectrum modification method according to this embodiment.<br>
20 	[0173] Further, in this embodiment, a case has been described as an example where spectrums are divided into two groups , a group of relatively large absolute amplitude and a group of relatively small absolute amplitude. However, it is also possible to divide into larger numbers<br>
25  	of groups so as to increase reproducibility of the dynamic range. <br>
[0174]  In addition, in this embodiment, a case has been<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	67<br>
described as an example where amplitude is converted using an average value as a reference and spectrums are divided into a group of relatively large amplitude and a group of relatively small amplitude based on the amplitude after<br>
 5 	conversion, but it is also possible to use the original amplitude value as is and carry out grouping of the spectrums based on the amplitude.<br>
[0175] Moreover, in this embodiment, a case has been described as an example where standard deviation is used <br>
10 	for calculating the variation degree of the absolute amplitude of the spectrum, but this is by no means limiting, and, for example, it is possible to use variance as the same statistical parameter as standard deviation. <br>
[0176] Further, in this embodiment, a case has been<br>
15 	described as an example where an average value of absolute amplitude of the spectrum for each group is used as a typical value of spectral amplitude of each group, but this is by no means limiting, and, for example, it is possible to use a central value of the absolute amplitude<br>
20 	of the spectrum for each group.<br>
[0177]  Moreover, in this embodiment, a case has been described as an example where an amplitude value of each spectrum is used for adjustment of the dynamic range, but it is also possible to use a spectral energy value 25instead of the amplitude value.<br>
[0178] Further, when a typical value corresponding to each group is obtained, in the case where amplitude of<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	68<br>
the spectrum originally has a positive or negative sign as with, for example, an MDCT coefficient, it is not necessary to convert the average value to zero, and a typical value corresponding to each group may be obtained<br>
5 	simply using an absolute value of amplitude of the spectrum. [0179] The above is a description of each of the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0180] The coding apparatus and decoding apparatus of the present invention are by no means limited to each<br>
10 of the above-described embodiments, and various modifications thereof are possible.<br>
[0181] The coding apparatus and decoding apparatus of the present invention can be loaded on a communication terminal apparatus and base station apparatus of a mobile<br>
15  communication system so as to make it possible to provide a communication terminal apparatus and base station apparatus having the same operation effects as described above. [0182] Here, a case has been described as an example<br>
20 where the present invention is applied to a scaleable coding scheme, but the present invention may also be applied to other coding schemes.<br>
[0183] Moreover, a case has been described as an example where the present invention is configured using hardware,<br>
25 but it is also possible to implement the present invention using software. For example, by describing the coding method (decoding method) algorithm according to the<br><br>
2F05047-PCT	69<br>
present invention in a programming language, storing this program in a memory and making an information processing section execute this program, it is possible to implement the same function as the coding apparatus (decoding<br>
5  apparatus) of the present invention.<br>
[0184] Furthermore, each function block used to explain the above- described embodiments is typically implemented as an LSI constituted by an integrated circuit. These may be individual chips or may partially or totally<br>
10  contained on a single chip.<br>
[0185] Furthermore, here, each function block is described as an LSI, but this may also be referred to as "IC", "system LSI", "super LSI", "ultra LSI" depending on differing extents of integration.<br>
15 [0186] Further, the method of circuit integration is not limited to LSI's, and implementation using dedicated circuitry or general purpose processors is also possible . After LSI manufacture , utilization of a programmable FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) or a re configurable<br>
20  processor in which connections and settings of circuit<br>
cells within an LSI can be reconfigured is also possible.<br>
[0187]  Further, if integrated circuit technology comes out to replace LSI's as a result of the development of<br>
semi conduct or technology or a derivative other technology,<br>
25 it is naturally also possible to carry out function block integration using this technology. Application in biotechnology is also possible.<br><br>
