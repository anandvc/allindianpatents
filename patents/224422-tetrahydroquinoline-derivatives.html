Tetrahydroquinoline derivatives<br>
The invention relates to a compound having FSH modulatory activity, in particular a tetrahydroquinoline derivative, to a pharmaceutical composition containing the same,     as well as the use of said compound in medical therapy.<br>
Gonadotropins serve important functions in a variety of bodily functions including metabolism, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The hypophyseal gonadotropin FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) for example plays a pivotal role in the stimulation of follicle development and maturation whereas LH (luteinizing hormone) induces ovulation (Sharp, R.M. Clin Endocrinol. 33:787-807, 1990; Dorrington and Armstrong, Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 35:301-342,1979). Currently, FSH is applied clinically, in combination with LH, for ovarian stimulation i.e. ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and induction of ovulation in infertile anovulatory women (Insler, V., Int. J. Fertility 33:85-97, 1988, Navot and Rosenwaks, J. Vitro Fert. Embryo Transfer 5:3-13, 1988), as well as for male hypogonadism and male infertility.<br>
The gonadotropin FSH is released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and oestrogens, and from the placenta during pregnancy. In the female, FSH acts on the ovaries promoting development of follicles and is the major hormone regulating secretion of oestrogens. In the male, FSH is responsible for the integrity of the seminiferous tubules and acts on Sertoli cells to support gametogenesis. Purified FSH is used clinically to treat infertility in females and for some types of failure of spermatogenesis in males. Gonadotropins destined for therapeutic purposes can be isolated from human urine sources and are of low purity (Morse et al, Amer. J. Reproduct. Immunol, and Microbiology 17:143, 1988). Alternatively, they can be prepared as recombinant gonadotropins. Recombinant human FSH is available commercially and is being used in assisted reproduction (Olijve et al. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2:371, 1996; Devroey et al. Lancet 339:] 170,1992).<br><br>
The actions of the FSH hormone are mediated by a specific plasma membrane receptor that is a member of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors. These receptors consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and are able to interact with the Gs protein, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
The FSH receptor is a highly specific target in the ovarian follicle growth process and is exclusively expressed in the ovary. Blocking this receptor or inhibiting the signaling which is normally induced after FSH-mediated receptor activation will disturb follicle development and thus ovulation and fertility. Low molecular weight FSH antagonists could therefore form the basis for new contraceptives. Such FSH antagonists could give rise to diminished follicle development (no ovulation) with still sufficient estrogen production left to avoid adverse effects on e.g. bone mass.<br>
The present invention describes the preparation of low molecular weight hormone analogs that selectively have modulatory activity on the FSH receptor. The compounds of the invention can either be used as (partial) agonists or (partial) antagonists of the FSH-receptor.<br>

Suitable methods for the preparation of the compounds of the invention are outlined below.<br><br><br>
The. compounds of the present invention in which R2 and R3 are methyl can be prepared starting from (protected) anilines of general formula II-a-e in which R7 has the same meaning as previously defined, by means of the well-documented Skraup reaction, which yields 1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline derivatives of formula III-a-e.<br>
Related Skraup cyclizations are found in literature: A. Knoevenagel, Chem. Ber. 54:1726, 1921; R.L. Atkins and D.E. Bliss, J. Org. Chem. 43:1975, 1978; J.V. Johnson, B.S. Rauckman, D.P. Baccanari and B. Roth, J. Med. Chem. 32:1942, 1989; W.C. Lin, S.-T. Huang and S.-T. Lin, J. Chin. Chem. Soc. 43:497, 1996; J.P. Edwards, S.J. West, K.B. Marschke, D.E. Mais, M.M. Gottardis and T.K. Jones, J. Med. Chem. 41:303, 1998.<br>
The abovementioned reaction is typically conducted at elevated temperature in acetone, mesityl oxide or ethylacetoacetate in the presence of iodine or protic acid such as hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or aqueous hydrogen iodide. Alternatively, l,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinolines of formula IH-a-e can be prepared by reacting the corresponding aniline of formula II-a-e with acetone in the presence of MgSC^, 4-tert-butylcatechol and iodine (L.G. Hamann, R.I. Higuchi, L. Zhi, J.P. Edwards and X.-N. Wang, J. Med. Chem, 41:623, 1998). Starting materials can be either obtained directly from commercial sources or prepared by art-known aromatic ring substitutions, as are described e.g. by H. Cerfontain, Y. Zou and B.H. Bakker, Reel. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas, 113:403, 1994; A. Coppock, J. Org. Chem. 22:325, 1957; M. Schlosser, J.H. Choi and S. Takagishi, Tetrahedron, 46:5633, 1990.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general structure Vl-a-e, in which R2 and R3 are (2-4C)aIkyl and R7 is as previously defined, can generally be synthesized by cyclization of an aniline of formula I V-a-e with an appropriate ketone of formula V.<br><br><br>
The abovementioned reaction is typically conducted in an inert solvent such as toluene, at elevated temperature using protic or Lewis acids such as, but not limited to, p-toluenesulfonic acid or borontrifluoride to promote the cyclization (H. Walter, H. Sauter and T. Winkler, Helv. Chim. Acta, 75:1274,1992; H. Walter, Helv. Chim. Acta, 77;608, 1994; H. Walter and J. Schneider, Heterocycles, 41:1251, 1995; J.P. Edwards, J .D. Ringgenberg and T.K. Jones, Tetrahedron Lett. 39:5139,1998).<br>
The requisite building blocks of formula IV-a-e may be prepared by Wittig reaction of ketones of formula Vll-a-e. Introduction of substituents A on the aromatic ring can be accomplished using art-known aromatic ring substitutions either in the aniline stage or in the l,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline stage, as was mentioned above for compounds of formula II.<br><br>
In another approach, compounds of formula Vl-a-e in which R = R = H can be prepared from anilines of general formula II-a-e by reaction with 1-methylstyrene and formaldehyde in acetonitrile at ambient or elevated temperature. Related cyclizations are described in literature: J.M. Mellor and G.D. Merriman, Tetrahedron, 51:6115, 1995.<br>
Subsequent 1-JV-acylation or 1 -JV-sulfonylation of compounds of formula VI wherein R2, R3, R7 and A are as previously defined, can be carried out using standard conditions, well known to those skilled in the art. In a typical experiment, compounds of formula VI are reacted in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene or pyridine with an acylhalide or acid anhydride or a sulfonylchloride in the<br><br>
presence   of a   base   such   as,   but  not   limited   to,   A^iV-diisopropylethylamine,. triethylamine, piperidine or sodium hydride to give JV-acylated or JV-sulfonylated 1,2-dihydro-4-methylquinoline derivatives of formula VHI-a and Vlll-b, respectively.<br><br>
Related JV-acylations of a dihydroquinoline scaffold are found in literature: Zh. V. Shmyreva, Kh. S. Shikhaliev and E.B. Shpanig, Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn. Zaved., Khim. Khim. Tekhnol. 31:45, 1988; Zh. V. Shmyreva, Kh. S. Shikhaliev, L.P. Zalukaev, Y.A. Ivanov, Y.S. Ryabokobylko and I.E. Pokrovskaya, Zh. Obshch. Khim. 59:1391, 1989.<br>
1-iV-Formylation can be readily established by reaction of dihydroquinoline of formula VI with formic acid in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid at elevated temperature (see for example P. Bouyssou, C. Le Goff and J. Chenault, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 29:895, 1992) or with formic acid ethyl ester in the presence of sodium acetate, as was described in literature by e.g. N. Atanes, S. Perez, E. Guitan, L. Castedo and J.M. Saa, Tetrahedron, 50:11257, 1994.<br>
Introduction of the requisite phenyl group at position 4 of the dihydroquinoline scaffold can be accomplished via Friedel-Crafts alkylation of (substituted) benzene derivatives with the compounds of general structure VIII, wherein R1, R2, R3, R7 and A are as previously defined.<br><br><br>
The latter reaction is typically conducted at elevated temperatures either in neat (substituted) benzene or in an appropriate inert solvent such as heptane or hexane with (substituted) benzene as reagent, under catalysis of a Lewis acid (e.g. A1C13, AlBr3, FeCl3 or SnCU). Friedel-Crafts alkylations with l,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinolines are described in literature by B.A. Lugovik, L.G. Yudin and A.N. Kost, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR, 170:340, 1966; B.A. Lugovik, L.G. Yudin, S.M. Vinogradova and A.N. Kost, Khim. Geterosikl. Soedin, 7:795,1971.<br>
Compounds of the present invention, wherein R5 * Me and R1, R2, R3, R4, R7 and A are as previously defined, represented by formula XII, may be synthesized starting from tetrahydroquinoline ketones of formula X. Thus, Wittig reaction of a ketone of formula X with the appropriate Wittig reagent yields the unsaturated derivative represented by formula XI, which in turn is the starting material for a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of (substituted) benzene, via the same procedure as was outlined above for the preparation of compounds with general structure IX.<br><br>
The abovementioned Wittig reaction is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The requisite ketone of formula X can be prepared by reaction of an aniline of formula II with 3-chloro-3-methyl-l-butyne (XIII) in diethylether/water in the presence of copper powder and triethylamine which yields an alkyne of formula XIV. Hydrogen-halogen exchange can be carried out by deprotonation of a compound of formula XIV in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran with «-butyllithium at temperatures below -50 °C upon addition of p-toluenesulfonylchloride to give a chloride of general formula XV. Finally, acid-catalyzed (e.g. sulfuric acid) cyclization can be carried out at elevated temperature in a solvent such as polyethyleneglycol to give compounds of<br><br><br>
In a typical experiment, demethylation is achieved upon reaction of a compound of formula XH-a with BBr3 in an inert solvent such as, but not limited to, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at low temperature to give deprotected compounds of general formula XVII. Alternatively, demethylation can be accomplished upon reaction of<br><br>
compounds of formula Xll-a with BF3Me2S complex at ambient temperature in an inert solvent as was mentioned for demethylations using BBr3.<br><br>
Subsequent functionalizations of the free OH group in derivatives of formula XVII are also well known to those skilled in the art and can be easily established using reagents of formula XVIII-a-g.<br>
For the halide-containing reagents of formula XVIII, the abovementioned reaction is typically conducted at room temperature in a suitable solvent, e.g. an aprotic solvent such as ^JV-dimethylformamide, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a base, such as, but not limited to, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or sodium hydride. Additives such as iVjA'-dunethylammopyridine or tetrabutylammoniumiodide may accelerate the latter reaction. Furthermore, utilisation of isocyanates or isothiocyanates of formula XVIII-d and XVIII-e in an inert solvent at ambient or elevated temperatures yields compounds of formula I-a wherein Y=NHC(0) or NHC(S), respectively.<br>
Compounds wherein Y = C(O) may also be obtained in an alternative way using carboxylic acids of general formula XVTII-b, using a coupling reagent such as O-(benzotriazol-l-y^-A^A^jV^V'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-y^-MACA^^iV'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or bromotripyrrolodinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP) and a tertiary base, e.g. A^iV-diisopropylethylarnine, in a solvent such as A^jV-dimethylforrnamide or dichloromethane at ambient or elevated temperature.<br><br>
Compounds represented by formula I-b-c, in which W = R^R/'N or R80, respectively, can be synthesized by reacting compounds of general formula XVII with an acid chloride of formula XIX using standard conditions.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of structure I-b-c may be prepared from derivatives of formula XVII and an acid chloride of formula XIX in which W = OEt, followed by base-mediated (e.g NaOH) saponification and subsequent condensation of the free carboxylic acid with either amines of general structure R^R9^! or alcohols of general structure R8OH in the presence of a coupling reagent such as the earlier mentioned TBTU, HATU or PyBrOP and a tertiary base such as TV, TV-diisopropylethylamine.<br>
Compounds represented by formula I-d-e, in which V = R^R^ or RsO, respectively, can be obtained via nucleophilic substitution of a halogen such as Br, present in compounds of formula XXI by amines of general structure R8,R9NH or alcohols of general structure R8OH. In turn, the requisite tetrahydroquinoline of formula XXI cart be synthesized from a compound of formula XVII and a bromoacylchloride of general structure XX, using art-known synthetic procedures.<br><br><br>
Compounds represented by formula I-f-g, in which U = (substituted) heteroaromatic or (substituted) phenyl, respectively, may be prepared via Suzuki coupling of (substituted) iodobenzoylderivatives of formula XXII with boronic acids of general formula XXIII-a-b.<br><br>
In a typical experiment, an iodide of formula XXII is reacted with a boronic acid of formula XXIII-a-b in a solvent mixture such as dimethoxyethane/ethanol using cesium fluoride and a palladium catalyst such as palladiumtetrakistriphenylphosphine or tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium at elevated temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. Addition of triphenylphosphine may accelerate the reaction and improve the yield. The abovementioned reaction is described extensively in literature. See for example: A. Suzuki, Ace. Chem. Res. 15:178, 1982; N. Miyaura, T. Ishiyama, H. Sasaki, M. Ishikawa, M. Satoh and A. Suzuki, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:314, 1989.<br>
Likewise, compounds represented by formula I-h wherein X = NH and Y is as previously defined can be synthesized via the same methods as were described above for compounds of general formula Ia-g in which X = O.<br><br><br>
Compounds represented by formula I-i-j in which X = C(O) or S(0)2 and Y = NH or O, respectively, may be obtained via reaction of the corresponding acyl or sulfonyl chlorides of formula XXV with amines of general structure R6NH2 or alcohols of general structure R6OH via the same method as was described earlier for the preparation of compounds of formula I-a.<br><br>
The requisite acyl or sulfonyl chlorides of formula XXV can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula XXIV by treatment with e.g POCl3, PC15, oxalylchloride, phosgene or SOCI2, in solvents such as toluene, acetonitrile, or N,N-dimethylformamide, as is described extensively in literature. See for example M. Bonnat, M. Bradley and J.D. Kilburn, Tetrahedron Lett. 37:5409, 1996; J.G. Montana, G.M. Buckley, N. Cooper, HJ. Dyke and L. Gowers, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett, 8:2635, 1998; J. Hayler, P.D. Kane, D. LeGrand, F. Lugrin, K. Menear, R. Price, M. Allen, X. Cockcroft, J. Ambler, K. Butler and K. Durren, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 10:1567,2000.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula XXIV in which X = C(O) can be used directly as starting materials for the preparation of derivatives of formula I-i-j, using coupling reagents as were mentioned previously.<br>
For compounds represented by formula I-k-p, wherein X = C(O) or S(0&gt;2 and Y = NH or O and n = 1-4, art-known synthetic procedures can be followed.<br><br><br>
Thus, preparation of tetrahydroquinolines of formula I-k-1 can be accomplished by<br>
condensing an amine or alcohol represented by formula XXVI (Y = NH or O,<br>
respectively) with chlorides of general formula XXV using standard conditions. In a<br>
similar approach, amines or alcohols of formula XXVII can be utilized to prepare<br>
compounds of formula I-m-n. Finally, the use of the earlier mentioned boronic acids<br>
XXIII leads to the preparation of compounds of formula I-o-p via the earlier mentioned<br>
Suzuki coupling reaction.	,<br>
Compounds of the present invention wherein X-Y is a bond, represented by formula I-q, can be prepared directly from commercially available or easily preparable anilines of formula XXVIII via the reaction sequence Skraup, acylation and Friedel-Crafts alkylation.<br><br><br>
In another approach, compounds represented by formula I-r in which X-Y is a bond and U = (substituted) heteroaromatic or (substituted) phenyl, may be prepared via Suzuki condensation of the corresponding 6-iodo tetrahydroquinoline derivatives of formula XXIX with boronic acids of general formula XXIII, as was previously mentioned.<br><br>
The requisite iodide of formula XXIX can be obtained from the corresponding amine by means of the well-known Sandmeijer reaction.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention, which can be in the form of a free base, may be isolated from the reaction mixture in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be obtained by treating the free base of formula I with an organic or inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, and ascorbic acid.<br>
The compounds of the present invention possess at least one chiral carbon atom and may therefore be obtained as pure enantiomers, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture of diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, or chromatography using chiral columns. For diastereomers, straight phase or reversed phase columns may be used.<br>
The compounds of the invention may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of skill in the art that charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with<br><br>
water, or form solvated species when concentrated in a solution with an appropriate<br>
organic solvent. The compounds of this invention include the hydrates or solvates of the compounds listed.<br>
For selecting active compounds testing at 10"5 M must result in an activity of more than 20% of the maximal activity when FSH is used as a reference. Another criterion might be the EC50 value which must be 
The skilled artisan will recognize that desirable EC50 values are dependent on the compound tested. For example, a compound with an EC50 which is less than 10"5 M is generally considered a candidate for drug selection. Preferably this value is lower than 10~7 M. However, a compound which has a higher EC50, but is selective for the particular receptor, may be even a better candidate.<br>
Methods to determine receptor binding, as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity, of gonadotropins are well known. In general, expressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and binding or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response, isolated DNA encoding the FSH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin (Jia etal, Mol.Endocrin., 5:759-776, 1991).<br>
Methods to construct recombinant FSH expressing cell lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor is attained by expression of the DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for site directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions, or all, of the DNA encoding the desired protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided to the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic<br><br>
hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells expressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively, isolated cell membranes containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of compound<br>
For measurement of binding, radioactively labeled or fluorescently labeled compounds may be used. As reference compound human recombinant FSH can be used. In the alternative also competition binding assays can be performed.<br>
Another assay involves screening for FSH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of receptor mediated cAMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expression of the receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The amount of cAMP is then measured. The level of cAMP will be reduced or increased, depending on the inhibitory or stimulating effect of the test compound upon binding to the receptor.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells lines can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which responds to the level of cAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or might be constructed in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, Ch., Himmler, A. and Czernilofsky, A.P., (1995) Curr.Opin.Biotechnol. 6:574.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tetrahydroquinoline derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having the general formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries and<br><br>
optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of<br>
being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to<br>
the recipients thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise the<br>
tetrahydroquinoline derivatives l-acetyl-6-benzoylamino-4-(4-methylphenyl)-l ,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline,	1 -acetyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2,4,6-<br>
tetramethylquinoline,	l-acetyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2^,4,6,8-<br>
pentamethylquinoline,	l-acetyl-6-methoxy-4-phenyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-22,4-<br>
trimethylquinoline,	l-acetyl-6-trifluoroacerylamino-4-(4-metiiylphenyl)-1,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline, l-acetyl-6-trifluoroacetylammo-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline, 1 -acetyl-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1 ,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2,4,6-tetramethylquinoline and l-acetyl-4-(4-bromophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,2,4,6-tetramethylquinoline.<br>
Compositions include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, local, or rectal administration, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.<br>
For oral administration, the active ingredient may be presented as discrete units, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granulates, solutions, suspensions, and the like.<br>
For parenteral administration, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, e.g. injection liquids in predetermined amounts, for example in sealed vials and ampoules, and may also be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, prior to use.<br>
Mixed with such pharmaceutical^ acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro, A.R. et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th Edition., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing), the active agent may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids the active agent can be applied as a fluid composition, e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a nasal spray.<br><br>
For making solid dosage units, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharma-ceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the active agent of the invention can be administered as solid compositions include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts. For parenteral administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions and sterile injectable solutions may be used, containing pharmaceutically acceptable dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, such as propylene glycol or butylene glycol.<br>
The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition, as hereinbefore described, in combination with packaging material suitable for said composition, said packaging material including instructions for the use of the composition for the use as hereinbefore described.<br>
The tetrahydroquinoline derivatives of the invention can also be administered in the form of implantable pharmaceutical devices, consisting of a core of active material, encased by a release rate-regulating membrane. Such implants are to be applied subcutaneously or locally, and will release the active ingredient at an approximately constant rate over relatively large periods of time, for instance from weeks to years. Methods for the preparation of implantable pharmaceutical devices as such are known in the art, for example as described in European Patent 0,303,306 (AKZO Nobel N.V.).<br>
The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, will necessarily be dependent upon the therapeutic effect to be achieved (treatment of infertility; contraception), and may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001-25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals<br><br>
throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used in therapy.<br>
A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of a tetrahydroquinoline derivative compound having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of disorders responsive to FSH receptor mediated pathways, preferably for the control of fertility, more preferably for the treatment of infertility or to prevent fertility. The compounds according to the invention can also be used for the treatment of hormone-dependent disorders such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and endometriosis.<br>

FSH activity of compounds were tested in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the human FSH receptor and cotransfected with a cAMP responsive element (CRE) / promoter directing the expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Binding of ligand to the Gs-coupled FSH receptor will result in an increase of cAMP, which in turn will induce an increased transactivation of the luciferase reporter construct The luciferase signal was quantified using a luminescence counter. For test compounds, ECjo values (concentration of test compound causing half-maximal (50%) stimulation) were calculated. For that purpose the software program GraphPad PRISM, version 3.0 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego) was used.<br>
