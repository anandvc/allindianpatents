APPLICANT<br>
Galaxy Surfactants Limited<br>
C-49/2, TTC Industrial Area, Pawne, Navi-Mumbai 400 703, Maharashtra, India.<br>
A Public Limited Company Registered under Indian Company"s Act-1966<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
Field of invention<br><br><br><br>
The present invention provides a novel to make multi-functional actives "Actives" are molecules having specific functional attributes. These multifunctional actives will be referred as "Actives" hence forth in this patent. This novel approach in converting these functional actives into cationic surfactants by employing quaternisation process of tertiary nitrogen by epoxidation in aqueous media. The resultant quaternary ammonium base is neutralized with another active. There may be one or more such nitrogen ions present in the active molecule or can be introduced by reacting with suitable amines as mentioned in this invention later.<br>
Most of the actives used in various applications are water insoluble. Hence, they are delivered in emulsion form with the aid of surfactants. Some of the actives even if water soluble still requires surfactants for better spreading. Some time even help of solvent is also required to solubalise the actives. This invention provides approach to make these actives water soluble at the same time make them behave as surfactants by them selves. This novel approach also make it possible to combine more than one actives in the same molecule.<br>
Quaternary compounds are known for their antibacterial properties as well as their substantive nature. This invention provides, usage of these properties along with functional actives . This invention also provides an approach / process to make such multifunctional molecule . Epoxydation is a known process for quaternisation with this approach epoxidation can also be used to make tertiary nitrogen, which can be further converted to quaternary compound by further epoxydation in  aqueous conditions .<br>
Attributes of these actives include but not limited to UV rays absorption properties, anti microbial properties, anti fungal property, anti dandruff, emulsifying property, fiber conditioning property, surface wetting property, film forming property, cleaning &amp; detersive property, emulsifying and dispersing property, herbicidal, pesticidal, biocidal, weedicidal.<br>
These properties can be designed to the requirement &amp; needs of the any formulations including cosmetics, medicinal, personal care, detergent &amp; cleaning, sun care, pesticidal, fiber care, pains , polymers and plastics are some of the examples of applications where in the concept presented in this patent cab be used.<br><br><br>
The basic process is represented as follows.<br>
R1 + Amines<br>
Esters or amides or imidazolines<br>
Process with epoxidation in aqueous media using EO or PO or other epoxydatton agents in aqueous media<br>
Base with quaternary nitrogen<br>
Neutralisation with actives R1 or R2 or R3 as defined below<br>
Multifunctional novel molecule<br>
Where in R1 is a molecule aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic, substituted or un-substituted, saturated or unsaturated entities attached to functional groups like acid chloride or carboxyl or phenyl or any other functional group capable of giving amide or ester bonding.<br>
R2, R3 etc molecule aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic, substituted or un-substituted, saturated or unsaturated entities attached to functional group capable of providing acidity such as carboxylate, Hydroxide, phosphoric, sulphonic, thip etc.<br>
In typical examples, but not limited to, R1 can be taken from Para methoxy cinnamic acid , fatty acids C6 to C24 , Undecylenic acid, Para amino benzoic acid, Salicylic acid, antharanilic acid, Benzophenones, Triclosan, Phenolic or para chloro meta xylenol or pentachlorophenol, or N-(phosphonomethyl) glycerin, (Glyphosate) any such active, functional molecule etc<br>
The amine back bone can be sourced from following amines. Dimethyl amino propyl amine (DMAPA), Amino ethyl ethanol amine (AEEA), Diethyl tri amine(DETA), tri ethanol amine (TEA),    methyl diethanol amine (MDEA), Di methyl amine (DMA), Tri methyl amine (TMA). and other like wise amines or poly amines.<br>
2<br><br><br>
The R1 to R4 is as illustrated in type 1.<br>
This relates &amp; not limited to usage for multi functional compound especially quaternary ammonium compounds having unique combination of more than one functional properties. This also provide surfactant properties entailing ease of formulation. The formulations include very wide range of application. Biocides, Fungicides, anti-bacterial, skin care, hair care, lip care, dental care, and surface-cleaning formulations, paints, polymers, plastics &amp; fabric care. Many of them have potential therapeutic value.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Surfactant is a group of chemicals used in variety of fields for different reasons. They are also known as emulsifier. Their roll in application is varied &amp; multi tasking. This includes foaming, wetting, solubilization, dispersing, spreading, coating, cleaning, wiping and so on. There use is so varied, it is difficult to envisage any formulation without usage of surfactant.<br>
Typical but not complete list of application include detergent powders. Drug formulation where in they are used to deliver drugs or disintegrate solid drug particles in to the metabolic system. Cosmetic formulation included shampoo to liquids cleaning milks to creams. Agriculture usage include crop protection solutions, which can be insecticide, herbicide, pesticides or fungicides. Oil soluble as well as water-soluble paint emulsions for wall care application.<br>
Each of the above application always intended to maximize benefits by delivering optimum dosages of actives at targeted spots. Many times a same formulation is intended for multiple functions. A cosmetic cream is used not only to protect the skin from ill effects of exposure to sun light but also to provide moisturizing effect to the skin as well as to deliver bactericide to protect the skin from environ mental bacterial contamination. Several such example can be given to point out multiple roll the formulation is expected to do.<br>
4<br><br>
The functional entity, which is expected to do these specific functions, are known<br>
as actives. In most of the cases these actives   are oil soluble. They   need<br>
auxiliary help to deliver the results. This includes solubilisers or emulsifiers,<br>
solvents, anti-oxidants, Colour stabilizers etc. Multi-functionality<br>
Of the formulations may also require more than one actives in the given<br>
formulation.<br>
The intention and object of this invention is to have such molecule, which will help us to reduce or nullify the requirement of this auxiliary help for wide array of formulation.<br>
Many molecules used in trade do provide this opportunity, as availability of chemically potential group in the molecule. For example, a surfactant molecule used in hair care formulation can be modified to give in conditioning as well as sunscreen protection. A bactericidal molecule having free OH group can be esterified or neutralized or amidised to impart it surface active properties. One can also make a water soluble active by this modification. In case of suitable available nitrogen atom in many molecules can be quatemised and the molecule is made substantive. This sight is also exploited to attach other active entities to impart sunscreen properties or surfactant properties or anti microbial properties as well.<br>
As will be shown later, this results in reducing requirement of actives, decreasing need for additional auxiliary in-puts and many other benefits. Thus a long felt need of multifunctional molecule is conceptualized in this invention.<br>
Prior art and Summery of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides water soluble &amp; or water dispersible functional compound, which is generally known as "Active" with one or more functional usages / attributes. The attributes can be one or more at the same time in the molecule.<br>
They include UV rays absorption properties, anti microbial properties, anti fungal property, emulsifying property, fiber conditioning property, surface wetting property, film forming property, cleaning &amp; detersive property, emulsifying and dispersing property.<br>
These properties can be designed to the requirement &amp; needs of the any formulations. Cosmetics, medicinal, personal care, detergent &amp; cleaning, fire fighting, sun care, winter care are some of the examples of formulation where in the concept presented in this patent cab be used.<br>
Many of the above mentioned formulations contains compound which are intend to function &amp; known as actives. They are delivered to do the function by way of suitable formulation. These formulation contains other in puts to augment the action of actives.<br>
5<br><br>
For example Octyl methoxy cinnamate is a compound used In sunscreen lotions meant to protect the body from harmful effects of sun rays. The Octyl methoxy cinnamate being oil, water insoluble compound requires emulsifiers for delivering the same on the skin surface. The additives include film forming compounds, moisturizers. Since OMC is only effective on certain wave length range known as UVA (280 to 320 nm) range additional sunscreen compound is used to enhance the effective ness through 320 to 400 nm. Compound like Benzophenon - 3 are used for this purpose. The results also accompanied by „ oily feeling, over dose requirement of actives and ill effect of certain surfactants such as harsh ness etc.<br>
The invention presented here can be applied to ensure that the same molecule gives sunscreen protection over the entire range by design. It can be made water soluble reducing or not requiring any surfactant. This also reduces the oily feeling. By its nature these compound are quaternary and thus substantive to the skin. This in turn reduces the dosage form required.<br>
For a formulation requiring to provide sunscreen protection as well as emolliency / conditioning giving property can be incorporated in the molecule by introducing the fatty alkyl group. Thus making the sunscreen molecule duel functional. It is widely reported that the hair become fragile due to effects of sun rays as well as become dry due to exposure to atmosphere.<br>
Although the US patent 5601811 refers to water soluble sunscreen compound it does not give scope of enlarging the functionality or duel usage compound.<br>
In another application in skin care formulation a sunscreen protection is provided along with microbial protection to skin. Present invention allow us to design a molecule as per requirement. In a conventional art this can be done by using sunscreen compounds like p-amino benzoic acid (PABAJ, p-methoxy cinnamate in combination with anti bacterial agents such as trichlosan Both actives are water insoluble demanding skill &amp; complicated system for delivery.<br>
In present invention the compound such as p-methoxy cinnamido propyl 2-hydroxy ethyl dimethyl ammonium salt of 5-chloro -2 (2,4 dichloro phenoxy) phenol can be prepared &amp; used in skin care formulation to provide double protection to the user.<br>
In agriculture pesticide formulation forms an important crop protection tools. Many of the actives used here are water insoluble. To be effective the active needs to be spread on contact surfaces of the plant such as leaves. Solubility in water do help them in there function. They should remain there for longer time for continued protection. In addition to this the residual quantities should not pose a threat to environment &amp; user. This entails usage of solvents, surfactants, hydro topes in them.<br>
6<br><br>
Quaternary ammonium compound have been used since long. The positive Nitrogen also imparts many useful properties to the compound. Few of them are substantives on skin, cloth, hair etc. Antibacterial &amp; anti fungal properties.<br>
These quaternary compounds are manufactured by different chemical routes well evaluated in prior art.<br>
An ethoxylation in aqueous media is one of such route used since many years. Surprisingly we have invented a method to modify these molecule further which will impart more useful properties in addition to the conventional properties of quatemary compounds.<br>
Present invention pertains to salts of quatemary ammonium compounds with various acids, aromatic as well as short chain &amp; long chain fatty acids. This imparts the molecule duel functionality . The molecule will have at least one linear fatty chain or an aromatic chain This chain may be attached to the quatemary nitrogen covalently or ionically, thus imparting many more important properties to the molecule.<br>
The basic quatemary ammonium nitrogen can be ionically attached with another fatty acids or aliphatic or aromatic acid or mineral acid group by neutralization process using corresponding carboxylic a acid.<br>
This salt can be used suitably for different applications such as sun protection cosmetic formulations, cleaning, disinfecting formulations. The corresponding molecule can be introduced prior to quartemisation or after the quaternisation depending up on the application /intended use of the molecule.<br>
Rutzeb Horst &amp; others in WO 8909204 A 1 1989, used the ethoxylation process to make a quaternary compound with one or two long chain alkyl residues covalently bonded with nitrogen atom of quaternary compound. The invention relates its usage only as fabric softener.<br>
The similar compound preparation have been reported earlier for use in softening textiles ( CA: 111/19996704 K), but not for usage indicated in this invention nor for incorporating multi functionality. This patent also do not visualize application other than fabric softening.<br>
Objects of the invention:      «<br>
The inventors of the present patent further formulating art by introducing, anion with active attributes in the molecule. For this highly basic hydroxyl ion generated in unique quaternisation process is utilized. Thus enhancing and multiplying the functional attributes of original active molecule several time over. Thus the<br>
7<br><br>
present invention pertains to" usage of quaternary ammonium base salts in wide range of applications" as illustrated in examples. The application include usage of compounds of invention in formulations having multi-functionality.<br>
Present invention make this delivery, an easier job by making them water soluble or dispersible. The compound also have surfactant and substantive properties. This also reduce or eliminate requirement of solvent as well as surfactant in the formulations. Thus effectively open up opportunity of more efficient delivery at reduced dosages of toxic chemicals.<br>
Thus the present invention demonstrate &amp; provides solution for long felt need of having unique combination of more than one property in a given compound. This opens up very wide range of formulating options in far wider range of applications. The opportunity includes lower, efficient dosage, lower actives thus more environment friendly ness and more safety to the user.<br>
