Apparatus for Holding Stripper Bars in a Combing Machine, in Contact With Two Detaching Rolls<br>
The present invention concerns an apparatus for holding stripper bars in a comb¬ing machine, which contact two detaching rolls of the combing machine.<br>
In combing machines usually striper bars are used for stripping off waste fibres and other particles clinging to the circumferential surfaces of the detaching rolls therefrom.<br>
In a known combing machine a first stripper bar contactingly fitting against the back detaching roll is screwed to the upper rim of a front wall of a noils suction duct of the combing machine. A second stripper bar contactingly fitted against the front detaching roll with both its end portions is taken up in a groove each of a holding element screwed onto a holder angle mounted onto the frame of the combing machine. Dismantling and re-mounting of these stripper bars, e.g. for their replacement, is complicated and time-consuming.<br>
It is the goal of the present invention to create an apparatus of the type described above which permits simple mounting and dismantling of the stripper bars.<br>
The inventive apparatus used for achieving the goal of the invention is character¬ised in that the stripper bars at both their end portions are taken up in a groove each of a holding element and that each holding element is detachably coupled to a wall element of a noils suction duct arranged at about right angles with re¬spect to the axes of the detaching rolls.<br>
In a preferred embodiment each of the holding elements can be coupled to the corresponding wall element using pin-notch connections, in which the two notch¬es are arranged in such a manner that for mounting the holding element, after in¬sertion of a first pin into a first notch, the other pin can be inserted into the second notch if the holding element is pivoted about the axis of the first pin. In an ar¬rangement of this type each holding element can be engaged in its working posi-<br><br>
tion by simply inserting both pins into the notches. During operation the reaction force to the contacting force exerted on the detaching rolls can press the second pin into the second notch and hold in therein, in such a manner that the holding elements cannot be detached unintentionally from the wall element of the noils suction duct. If desired a detachable securing bolt, e.g. a screw, extending through a bore in the holding element and through an opening in the corresponding wall element, additionally can be arranged for each holding element.<br>
As a rule each of the holding elements supports the pins of the two pin-notch connections, and in this case the notches are formed in each of the wall elements; the inverse arrangement, however, also is possible.<br>
The wall elements of the noils suction duct arranged approximately at right angles with respect to the axes of the detaching rolls as a rule are just two side walls of this duct.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides An apparatus for holding stripper bars in a combing machine, which are contacting two detaching rolls of the combing machine, characterised in that each end portions of the stripper bars are taken up in a groove each of a holding element and that each holding element is detachably coupled with a wall element, each wall element extending approximately at right angles with respect to the axes of the detaching rolls, of a noils suction duct of the combing machine.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention is described in the following with reference to illustrated design examples. It is shown in:<br><br>
Fig. 1 a vertical section of elements of a combing position of a combing machine,<br>
Fig. 2 a partial section on a larger scale along line 2 according to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 an alternative design example in a view corresponding to a part of Fig. 1 on a larger scale, and in<br>
Fig. 4 a partial section along line 4 according to Fig. 3.<br>
In Fig. 1 a front portion of a bottom nipper frame 11 is shown which supports a bottom<br>
nipper plate 12 and which during operation of the combing machine moves to and fro<br>
between a front end position and a back end position. To the bottom nipper frame 11<br>
top nipper arms 13 are linked, which support a top nipper			<br><br>
blade 14. In the back end position of the bottom nipper frame 11 a front end por¬tion of a lap to be combed is nipped between the front edge of the bottom nipper plate 12 and the lower edge of the top nipper blade 14. This front end lap portion or fibre fringe is combed by a circular comb, or half comb respectively, 15 arrang¬ed on a continually rotating circular comb shaft 16.<br>
Then the bottom nipper frame 11 is moved into the shown front end position and the combed fibre fringe is merged with the combed fleece produced before on a back detaching roll 17, with which a top roll 18 co-operates. As the detaching roll 17 rotates forward the fibre fringe is pulled through a fixed comb (not shown) and is detached from the lap remaining on the bottom nipper plate 12. The combed fleece is carried on to a front detaching roll 19, with which a top roll 20 co-oper¬ates.<br>
The two detaching rolls 17 and 19 during operation of the combing machine are rotated forward and backward in the known manner of a pilgrim motion.<br>
Noils (short fibres) and impurities eliminated by the half comb 15 and by the fixed comb (not shown) are sucked downward in a noils suction duct comprising a front wall 21, lateral walls 22 and a back wall 23.<br>
To each detaching roll 17 and 19 a stripper bar 24, and 25 respectively, each is co-ordinated which for stripping fibres and other particles clinging to the circum¬ferential surface of the detaching roll contacts the circumference of the detaching roll. Each end portion of the stripper bar 24 is taken up in a groove 26 each in a holding element 27 and each end portion of the stripper bar 25 is taken up in a groove 28 each in the corresponding holding element 27.<br>
The holding element 27 is mounted to a rim section of the corresponding side wall 22 of the noils suction duct. It contains a groove 29 taking up the rim section of the side wall 22. The holding element 27 is detachably coupled to the side wall 22 by two pin-notch connections. In the holding element 27 two pins 30 and 31 are arranged extending transversely through the groove 29. The pin 30 is lo-<br><br>
cated in a notch 32 in the side wall 22 and the pin 31 is located in a notch 33 in the side wall 22. The two notches 32 and 33 as shown are arranged in such a manner that while the holding element 27 is being mounted (placing it onto the side wall 22) first the pin 30 - by moving the holding element 27 from left to right as shown in Fig. 1 - can be pushed into the notch 32 and subsequently the pin 31 - by pivoting the holding element 27 about the axis of the pin 30 counter clockwise according to Fig 1 - can be inserted into the notch 33. Detachment and dismantling of the holding element 27 from the side wall 22 can be effected also in simple manner if the inverse sequence movements is applied.<br>
The notch 33 extends approximately radially with respect to the detaching roll 19. During operation the pin 31 is pressed by the reaction force to the contacting force of the stripper bar on the detaching roll 19 into the notch 33 and is held therein in such a manner that the holding element can not be released uninten¬tionally from the side wall 22.<br>
As an additional safeguard a detachable securing pin can be provided for each holding element 27 extending through a bore in the holding element 27 and through an opening in the corresponding side wall 22, e.g. a screw 34 screwed into a nut 35. The nut 35 suitably can be fixed on the holding element 27.<br>
The contacting forces exerted by the stripper bars 24 and 25 onto the detaching rolls 17 and 19 advantageously are generated by springs pressing against the two stripper bars 24 and 25 individually. Advantageously in each of the grooves 26 and 28 of each holding element 27 a compression spring 36, and 37 respec¬tively, each is provided, which presses the corresponding stripper bar 24, and 25 respectively, upward in relation to the holding element. The compression springs 36 and 37 remain in the holding element 27 if the latter is detached from the side wall 22 and also if the stripper bars 24 and 25 are taken off from the groves 26, and 28 respectively.<br>
In the holding element 27 shown in Figures 1 and 2 a holding groove 29 taking up a rim portion of the side wall 22 prevents lateral shifting or tilting of the holding<br><br>
element 27 on the side wall 22. The same effect can be obtained by applying other means, of course, e.g. as in an alternative design example described in the following with reference to Figures 3 and 4.<br>
Furthermore in the design example according to Figures 1 and 2 in each of the two pin-notch connections coupling the holding element 27 with the side wall 22 the pin is secured in the holding element 27 and the notch is provided in the side wall. An inverse arrangement, however, also is possible, i.e. in one or in both pin-notch connections the pin could be secured on the side wall and the notch could be provided in the holding element.<br>
In the alternative design example according to Figures 3 and 4 again the end portion of the stripper bar 24 is taken up in a groove 26 and the end portion of the stripper bar 25 is taken up in a groove 28 in a holding element 27.1. The holding element 27.1 is arranged on a rim portion of the side wall 22.1 of the noils suc¬tion duct and is connected with this side wall using two pin-notch connections. On the side wall 22.1 two pins 30.1 and 31.1 protruding laterally are mounted, each placed in a notch 32.1, and 33.1 respectively, in the holding element 27.1.<br>
The two notches 32.1 and 33.1 again are arranged in such a manner that for mounting the holding element 27.1 the pin 30.1 first is inserted - by moving the holding element 27.1 from left to right according to Fig. 3 - into the notch 32.1 and subsequently the pin 31.1 - by pivoting the holding element 27.1 about the axis of the pin 30.1 counter clockwise - is inserted into the notch 33.1.<br>
The notch 33.1 again extends approximately radially with respect to the detach¬ing roll 19 in such a manner that the reaction force to the contacting force exerted by the stripper bar 25 onto the detaching roll 19 presses the holding element 27.1 with the notch 33.1 onto the pin 31.1. The longitudinal direction of the notch 32.1 extends approximately at right angles with respect to the longitudinal direc¬tion of the notch 33.1.<br>
The pins 30.1 and 31.1 are provided with heads 30.2, and 31.2 respectively,<br><br>
which prevent lateral shifting or tilting of the holding element 27.1 on the side wall 22.1.<br>
The wall element to which each holding element 27 or 27.1 is connected in the design examples described is one of the side walls 22 or 22.1 of the noils suction duct of the combing machine; the wall element used could, however, also be any other wall element rigidly connected to the noils suction duct and extending sub¬stantially at right angles with respect to the axes of the detaching rolls, e.g. a leg of an angle element mounted onto the front wall 21 of the noils suction duct.<br><br><br>
