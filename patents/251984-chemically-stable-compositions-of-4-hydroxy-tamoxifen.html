				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to chemically stable isomeric compositions of 4-<br>
hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT), an active metabolite of the drug tamoxifen.<br>
Tamoxifen acts on estrogen receptors throughout the body and, as both an<br>
agonist and antagonist, provokes a wide range of systemic effects. It is widely<br>
prescribed for breast cancer because it blocks the effects of estrogen in breast tissue,<br>
thereby slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells that are already present and<br>
preventing the development of new cancers. Because of its wide ranging effects,<br>
tamoxifen causes significant side effects, which increase the risk of endometrial cancer,<br>
endometrial hyperplasia and polyps, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism,<br>
changes in liver enzyme levels, and ocular toxicities, including cataracts. Additionally,<br>
patients treated with tamoxifen report having hot flashes, vaginal discharge, depression,<br>
amenorrhea, and nausea.<br>
Due to tamoxifen's drawbacks, some cancer researchers have proposed<br>
substituting 4-hydroxy tamoxifen as a treatment for breast cancer. 4-Hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that exhibits tissue-specificity<br>
for estrogen receptive tissues. In breast tissue, it functions as an estrogen antagonist.<br>
Studies have shown that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen can regulate the transcriptional activity of<br>
estrogen-related receptors, which may contribute to its tissue-specific activity. In vitro,<br>
4-hydroxy tamoxifen exhibits more potency than tamoxifen, as measured by binding<br>
affinity to estrogen receptors, or ERs, and a binding affinity similar to estradiol for<br>
estrogen receptors (Robertson et al, 1982; Kuiper et al, 1997).<br>
Research data supports the use of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen for treating breast<br>
cancer. In in vitro studies, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen inhibits the growth of both normal and<br>
cancerous breast cells (Nomura, 1985; Malet, 1988, 2002; Charlier, 1995). Additionally,<br>
transdermally delivered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exhibits an anti-tumor effect on human<br>
breast tumors grown subcutaneously in mice (U.S. patent No. 5,904,930). In humans,<br>
limited experiments have shown that percutaneously administered 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br><br><br>
can concentrate in local breast tumors, with very little systemic distribution (Mauvais-<br>
Jarvis, 1986). 4-Hydroxy tamoxifen also shows promise for treating mastalgia,<br>
excessive scarring and gynecomastia, and for decreasing breast density.<br>
In the chemical structure of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, or 1-[4-(2-N-<br>
dimethylaminoethoxy)phenyl]-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylbut-1-ene, a double bond<br>
between two carbon atoms gives rise to two stereoisomeric forms. Unlike tamoxifen, 4-<br>
hydroxy tamoxifen does not possess two identical phenyl groups, but rather has four<br>
different groups distributed over the alkene group. Cis-trans terminology, therefore, can<br>
not properly be applied to the isomers of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. Instead, E from the<br>
German Entgegen, meaning across, and Z from the German Zusammen, meaning<br>
together, are properly applied (see figures 1 and 2). Both isomers of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen are biologically active, but the Z isomer is more active biologically than the E<br>
isomer (U.S. Patent 6,172,263).<br>
In.the solid state, an isomeric mixture of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is very stable. In<br>
solution, however, isomerization between the Z and E forms occurs. Malet et al.<br><br>
observed that spontaneous isomerization of Z- into E-4-hydroxy tamoxifen occurred<br>
within 24-48h, but stabilized rapidly at a Z/E ratio of 70/30, whether in stock solution,<br>
culture medium or cultured cells and regardless of temperature (-20°C, 4°C or 37°C).<br>
See Malet et al. (2002). Katzenellenbogen et al. further demonstrated that hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen isomers that are initially 99% pure undergo a time- and temperature-<br>
dependent isomerization, so that after 2 days in tissue culture medium at 37°C they have<br>
isomerized to the extent of 20%. This isomerization occurs more slowly at 4°C than at<br>
37°C and its speed can be reduced by various antioxidants. See Katzenellenbogen et al.<br>
(1985). According to Sigma, a supplier of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, the 4- hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen E-Z interconversion process is favored by solvents of low dielectric constants<br>
when exposed to light and when incubated in culture medium. <br>
The isomerization process potentially can affect the activity of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising 4-hydroxy tamoxifen as an active ingredient. To meet<br>
international pharmaceutical regulatory requirements, therefore, a need exists for<br>
chemically stable compositions of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. A "stable" pharmaceutical<br>
composition is one whose qualitative and quantitative composition, including physical,<br>
chemical and biological characteristics, do not significantly change during time under<br><br><br>
specific conditions of temperature and moisture, e.g., during 3 years at 25°C/60%HR, 1<br>
year at 30°C/65%HR and/or 6 months with 40°C/75%HR. "Significant change" refers<br>
qualitative and/or quantitative differences that might affect the potency, efficacy or<br>
safety of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In providing a stable 4-hydroxy tamoxifen composition, it would be helpful to<br>
have a more complete understanding of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen isomerization process.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br><br>
The present inventors have discovered that the isomerization of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen in solution equilibrates at a Z:E-isorner ratio of approximately 1:1. Moreover,<br>
they have discovered that once this equilibrated ratio is attained, it remains stable.<br>
 In accord with this discovery, the present invention includes pharmaceutical<br>
compositions having 4-hydroxy tamoxifen as an active agent, wherein approximately<br>
50% of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists in Z isomeric form and the remainder is in E<br>
isomeric form. In specific embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated<br>
for percutaneous administration in a gel, a solution or another pharmaceutical form<br>
containing alcohol and an aqueous vehicle.<br>
 In a specific example, a gel formulation, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
 comprise:<br>
a)	about 0.01 % to 0.20 % by weight of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen,<br>
b)	about 0.5 % to 2.0 % by weight of isopropyl myristate,<br>
c)	about 60% to 75% by weight of absolute alcohol,<br>
d)	about 25% to 40% by weight of aqueous vehicle,<br>
e)	about 0.5% to 5% by weight of gelling agent,<br>
wherein the percentage of components are weight to weight of the composition.<br>
In another aspect, the invention includes a method of treating or preventing<br>
medical conditions by administering a pharmaceutical composition having 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen as an active agent, wherein approximately 50% of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
exists in Z isomeric form and the remainder is in E isomeric form, to a patient in need<br><br><br>
thereof. Medical conditions for which such administration is useful include breast<br>
cancer, mastalgia, breast density, excessive scarring and gynecomastia.<br>
' For purposes of prophylaxis or treatment, the pharmaceutical compositions may<br>
be administered by any means that delivers 4-hydroxy tamoxifen to estrogen receptor-<br>
bearing cells in vivo. It is preferable that the administration be done percutaneously<br>
(topically), to avoid the first-pass effect and related liver metabolism of the 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen. For percutaneous administration, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be applied to any<br>
skin surface. Application to the breasts is advantageous because 4-hydroxy'tamoxifen<br>
tends to concentrate in local subcutaneous tissues with estrogen receptors when<br>
administered percutaneously.<br>
 A broad range of topical formulations are suitable for performing the invention,<br>
but hydroalcoholic solutions and hydroalcoholic gels are preferred. The concentration of<br>
4-hydroxy tamoxifen in these formulations may vary, but a dose should result in local 4-<br>
hydroxy tamoxifen tissue concentrations that effectively oppose estrogenic driven<br>
effects.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention includes a kit for storage that comprises<br>
(a) a pharmaceutical composition having 4-hydroxy tamoxifen as an active agent,<br>
wherein approximately 50% of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists in Z isomeric form and<br>
the remainder is in E isomeric form, and (b) a container, wherein the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is contained within the container. In specific embodiments of this kit, the<br>
container may be a unit dose packet or a multiple dose container, such as a container<br>
with a metered pump.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for making a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising 4-hydroxy tamoxifen as an active agent, wherein<br>
approximately 50% of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists in Z isomeric form and the<br>
remainder is in E isomeric form.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention is based on the very surprising discovery that the<br>
isomerization of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in solution equilibrates at a Z:E isomer ratio of<br>
approximately 50:50, rather than the 70:30 ratio reported by Malet et al., and that once<br>
this equilibrated ratio is attained, it remains stable. The inventors further discovered that<br>
inter-conversion of the E and the Z isomers of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (see Figure 2) is a<br>
reversible reaction having an equilibrium constant k determined by the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
where [E] and [Z] are the equilibria concentrations of the corresponding isomers, and kf<br>
and kr respectively are the forward and reverse rate constants. The rates for the forward<br>
and reverse reactions, therefore, are equivalent.<br><br><br>
These insights on the behavior of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen isomers make po ssible<br>
the development of chemically stable pharmaceutical compositions that contain roughly<br>
equal amounts of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen Z and E isomers. In such compositions, the<br>
isomerization that occurs between Z and E forms does not significantly affect the<br>
composition's potency, efficacy or safety.<br>
Moreover, in view of the severity of pharmaceutical regulations, especially as to<br>
shelf-life stability, it is required to provide products whose compositions do not evolve<br>
with time. It is therefore a great advantage to provide formulations whose compositions<br>
are stable, and thus reliably and precisely defined.<br>
 The skilled person would know how to determine the relative amounts of the E<br>
and Z isomers in a given composition. For example, and as exemplified below, it is<br>
possible to use HPLC techniques to estimate the Z/E ratio.<br>
As discussed above, the prior art describes compositions with a Z/E ratio of<br>
70/30. In addition, according to the art, the Z isomer is believed to have a higher<br>
biological activity than its E counterpart. Therefore, taken together, the prior art<br>
teachings seem to point towards compositions enriched in the Z isomer.<br>
By contrast, the present invention provides compositions comprising 4-h.ydroxy<br>
tamoxifen with a Z/E ratio of about 50/50, and methods for making such compositions.<br>
This ratio is particularly suitable for administration to a human subject, since it<br>
essentially corresponds to the in vitro physiological equilibrium ratio found in tissues<br>
(Mauvais Jarvis P et al., Cancer Research, 1986,46, pl521-1525).<br>
 The inventors have performed several experiments to study the equilibration of<br>
4-hydroxy tamoxifen isomers under different conditions of light, temperature, pH and<br>
moisture, as well as in different media, at different concentrations of 4-hydroxy <br>
tamoxifen and at different alcohol/aqueous vehicle ratios. In brief, they prepared<br>
alcoholic solutions containing different concentrations of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen at<br>
different ratios of Z and E isomers, then observed the isomerization that occurred in<br>
those solutions over time at different temperatures and pH values (see the Examples<br>
below). By 6 months, a stable ratio (approximately 1: 1) of Z and E isomers was attained<br>
under many conditions, and a clear trend was observable under all conditions. The rate<br>
of equilibration directly depended on temperature, pH, alcohol/aqueous vehicle content, <br><br>
/<br><br><br>
light and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen concentration. In all cases, only the rate of equilibration<br>
was affected (see Examples below), but not the final ratio of Z and E isomers, which<br>
surprisingly remained approximately 1:1.<br>
From a chemical kinetics viewpoint, dielectric constant is recognized as one of<br>
the fundamental properties that influences solvolytic reaction rates. In this regard,<br>
publications exist that highlight the influence of water on the degradation of molecules.<br>
For example, Sanyude et al, studied the influence of the water:alcohol ratio on the<br>
degradation of aspartame. They reported that the degradation rate of aspartame<br>
increased as the dielectric constant of the solvent medium decreased, i.e., when the water<br>
concentration in the medium decreases. By contrast, the present inventors have found<br>
that the isomerization rate of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is increased as the dielectric constant<br>
of the solvent medium is increased, i.e., when the water concentration in the medium<br>
increases.<br>
 In accord with the inventors' discoveries, the present invention includes<br>
pharmaceutical compositions that comprise 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, wherein about 50% of<br>
the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists in a Z isomeric form and the remainder of the 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen exists in an E isomeric form. In specific embodiments, about 45% - 55%,<br>
about 46% - 54%, about 47% -'53%, about 48% - 52%, about 49% - 51% or about 50% '<br>
of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is in a Z isomeric form. Preferably about 49% - 51%, and<br>
more preferably about 50% of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is in a Z isomeric form. These<br>
contents are defined at the equilibrium state and not at the manufacture of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Equilibrated ratios of Z and E 4-hydroxy tamoxifen isomers can be obtained in<br>
a pure alcoholic composition or a mixture of an alcohol and a aqueous vehicle by<br>
admixing known quantities of the isomers or by subjecting the composition to conditions<br>
that speed the equilibration process, such as high temperature, high 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
content, high aqueous vehicle content or UV light. The inventors have shown that the<br>
molecular size of the alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) does not have an effect on the rate<br>
of isomerization.<br>
 Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in any<br>
dosage form capable of delivering 4-hydroxy tamoxifen to estrogen receptors in vivo.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the compositions are formulated for "percutaneous administration," a phrase<br>
that denotes any mode of delivering a drug from the surface of a patient's skin, through<br>
the stratum comeum, epidermis, and dennis layers, and into the microcirculation. This is<br>
typically accomplished by diffusion down a concentration gradient. The diffusion may<br>
occur via intracellular penetration (through the cells), intercellular penetration (between<br>
the cells), transappendageal penetration (through the hair follicles, sweat, and sebaceous<br>
glands), or any combination of these.<br>
Percutaneous administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen offers several advantages.<br>
First, it avoids the hepatic metabolism that occurs subsequent to oral administration<br>
(Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 1986). Second, percutaneous administration significantly reduces<br>
systemic drug exposure, and the attendant risks from non-specifically activating estrogen<br>
receptors throughout the body; this, because topical 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is absorbed<br>
primarily into local tissues. In particular, when 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is percutaneously<br>
applied to breasts, high concentrations accumulate in the breast tissue, presumably due to<br>
many estrogen receptors therein, without creating a high plasma concentration (Mauvais-<br>
Jarvis et al., supra).<br>
The effectiveness of percutaneous drug administration depends on many<br>
factors, including drug concentration, surface area of application, time and duration of<br>
application, skin hydration, physiochemical properties of the dmg, and partitioning of the<br>
dmg between the fonnulation and-the skin. Dmg formulations intended for percutaneous<br>
use take advantage of these factors to achieve optimal delivery. Such formulations often<br>
comprise penetration enhancers that improve percutaneous absorption by reducing the<br>
resistance of the stratum comeum by reversibly altering its physiochemical properties,<br>
changing hydration in the stratum comeum, acting as co-solvent, or changing the<br>
organization of lipids and proteins in the intercellular spaces. Such enhancers of<br>
percutaneous absorption include surfactants, DMSO, alcohol, acetone, propyleneglycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, fatty acids or fatty alcohols and their derivatives, hydroxyacids,<br>
pyrrolidones, urea, essential oils, and mixtures thereof. In addition to chemical<br>
enhancers, physical methods can increase percutaneous absorption. For example,<br>
occlusive bandages induce hydration of the skin. Other physical methods include<br>
iontophoresis and sonophoresis, which use electrical fields and high-frequency<br><br><br>
ultrasound, respectively, to enhance absorption of drugs that are poorly absorbed due to<br>
their size and ionic characteristics.<br>
The many factors and methods relating to percutaneous drug delivery are<br>
reviewed in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, Alfonso R.<br>
Gennaro (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000), at pages 836-58, and in PERCUTANEOUS<br>
ABSORPTION: DRUGS COSMETICS MECHANISMS METHODOLOGY, Bronaugh and Maibach<br>
(Marcel Dekker, 1999). As these publications evidence, those in the pharmaceutical<br>
field can manipulate the various factors and methods to achieve efficacious percutaneous<br>
delivery.<br>
For percutaneous administration, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen may be delivered in a<br>
hydroalcoholic solution, hydroalcoholic gel, ointment, cream, gel, emulsion (lotion),<br>
powder, oil or similar formulation.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen is formulated<br>
in a alcoholic formulation, preferably in a hydroalcoholic gel. The amount of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen in such a gel may range from about 0.001 to about 1.0 gram of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen per 100 grams of gel. Preferably, it ranges from about 0.01 to about 0.2 gram<br>
of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen per 100 grams of gel. In such embodiments, 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen may constitute about 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%, 0.04%, 0.05%, 0.06%, 0.07%,<br>
0.08%, 0.09%, 0.10%, 0.11%, 0.12%, 0.13%, 0.14%, 0.15%, 0.16%, 0.17%, 0.18%,<br>
0.19% or 0.20% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
 4-Hydroxy tamoxifen formulations of the invention generally will comprise one<br>
or more nonaqueous vehicles, such as alcoholic vehicles. These vehicles should be<br>
capable of dissolving both 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and any penetration enhancer used.<br>
They also should have a low boiling point, preferably less than 100oC at atmospheric<br>
pressure, to permit rapid evaporation upon contact with the skin. Preferred alcoholic<br>
vehicles are ethanol and isopropanol. In particular, ethanol effectively contributes to the<br>
percutaneous absorption of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen by rapidly evaporating upon contact<br>
with skin. The amount of absolute alcoholic vehicle in a formulation according to the<br>
invention generally ranges between 35% and 99.9%, preferably between 50% and 85%,<br>
more preferably between 60%) and 75% by weight. Thus, the amount of absolute<br><br><br>
nonaqueous vehicle in a gel formulation may be about 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%,<br>
66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74% or 75% by weight.<br>
 Formulations also may comprise an aqueous vehicle, which permits<br>
solubilization of any hydrophilic molecules in a formulation, and also promotes<br>
moisturization of the skin. An aqueous vehicle also can regulate pH, preferably in the<br>
range of about 4 to about 12, more preferably in the range of about 6 to about 11, even<br>
more preferably in the range of about 8 to about 10, and most preferably at about 9. As<br>
shown below, the pH, and therefore the choice of a buffer solution, affects the rate of<br>
equilibration between 4-hydroxy tamoxifen E and Z isomers. The final equilibrium ratio,<br>
however, remains equal to about 1:1 regardless of the buffer.<br>
Aqueous vehicles include alkalinizing and basic buffer solutions, including<br>
phosphate buffered solutions (e.g., dibasic or monobasic sodium phosphate), citrate<br>
buffered solutions (e.g., sodium citrate or potassium citrate) and simply purified water.<br>
The phosphate buffer is preferred according to the invention. The amount of an aqueous<br>
vehicle preferably ranges between 0.1 % and 65% by weight of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition, more preferably between 15% and 50%, and still more preferably between<br>
.25%.and 40%, Thus, the amount of an aqueous vehicle may be about 25%, 26%, 27%,<br>
28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39% or 40%. In the case<br>
that formulations contain an aqueous vehicle, the amount of absolute alcoholic vehicle in<br>
a formulation is preferably from about 60% to about 75%.<br>
4-Hydroxy tamoxifen formulations may also comprise one or more<br>
percutaneous absorption enhancers. The preferred percutaneous absorption enhancers<br>
are fatty acid esters. One highly preferred example of a fatty acid ester penetration<br>
enhancer is isopropyl myristate. When isopropyl myristate is used in a gel, the amount<br>
may range from about 0.1 to about 5.0 grams per 100 grams of gel. Preferably, the<br>
amount of isopropy myristate ranges from about 0.5 to about 2.0 grams per 100 grams of<br>
gel. hi such embodiments, isopropyl myristate may constitute about 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%,<br>
0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5%, 1.6%, 1.7%, 1.8%, 1.9% or 2.0% by<br>
weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Additionally, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen formulations may comprise one or more<br>
gelling agents to increase the viscosity of a formulation and/or to function as a<br><br><br>
solubilizing agent. Depending on the gelling agent's nature, it may constitute between<br>
0.1% and 20% by weight of a formulation, preferably between 0.5% and 10%, more<br>
preferably between 0.5% and 5%. Thus, the amount of a gelling agent may be about<br>
0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5% or 5.0%. Preferred gelling<br>
agents include carbomers, cellulose derivatives, poloxamers and poloxamines. More<br>
particularly, preferred gelling agents are chitosan, dextran, pectins, natural gum and<br>
cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC),<br>
and the like. One highly preferred gelling agent is hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
When a formulation comprises a gelling agent, in particular a non-<br>
preneutralized acrylic polymer, it may advantageously also comprise a neutralizing<br>
agent. The neutralizing agent/gelling agent ratio preferably is between 10:1 and 0.1:1,<br>
more preferably between 7:1 and 0.5:1, and still more preferably between 4:1 and 1:1.<br>
Thus, the neutralizing agent/gelling agent ratio may be about 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1,<br>
1:1 or 0.5:1. A neutralizing agent should form, in the presence of the polymer, salts that<br>
are soluble in the vehicle. A neutralizing agent also should permit optimum swelling of<br>
polymer chains during neutralization of charges and formation of polymer salts. Useful<br>
neutralizing agents include sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, arginine, aminomethylpropanol, trolamine and tromethamine. Those skilled<br>
in the art will select a neutralizing agent according to the type of gelling agent employed<br>
in a formulation. When cellulose derivatives are used as gelling agents, however, no<br>
neutralizing agents are required.<br>
Table 1 describes the composition of two highly preferred 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
gel formulations. All the component are pharmaceutically acceptable components.<br><br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered to treat<br>
numerous medical conditions for which tamoxifen and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen are useful.<br>
For example, they may be administered to treat breast cancer (Mauvais-Jarvis, 1986;<br>
Example 4), mastalgia (Fentiman 1986, 1988, 1989), excessive scarring (Hu, 1998; Hu<br>
2002) or gynecomastia (Gruntmanis and Braunstein (2001)). They also may be<br>
administered to prevent breast cancer in patients at high risk for developing that disease<br>
or to reduce breast density when that condition interferes with mammography (Atkinson,<br>
1999; Brisson, 2000; Son, 1999). See also U.S. provisional patent application Nos.<br>
60/433,959, filed December 18, 2002; 60/433,958, filed December 18, 2002; and<br>
60/458,963, filed April 1, 2003, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, for a<br>
complete description of these uses.<br>
Although the invention is not constrained to any particular theory, clinically<br>
significant side effects of anti-estrogen agents occur when the agents displace estradiol in<br>
non-target tissues. Because 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and estradiol have similar binding<br>
affinities for estrogen receptors, a competition between them for receptor binding would<br>
be approximately equal when the concentration of each compound approximates that of<br>
the other. If the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen concentration exceeds the estradiol concentration,<br>
the former will be bound preferentially to the estrogen receptors, and vice versa. By<br>
administering 4-hydroxy tamoxifen locally, high concentrations can be achieved in the<br>
target tissues without simultaneously raising 4-hydroxy tamoxifen plasma levels to a<br>
point where significant systemic competition for estradiol receptors occurs.<br><br><br>
 In women, doses of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen that result in plasma concentrations<br>
less than about 80 pg/mL, or the mean estradiol concentration in normal premenopausal<br>
women, are preferred. More preferably, doses of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen will result in<br>
plasma concentrations less than about 50 pg/mL. In men, doses of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
that result in plasma concentrations less than about 20 pg/mL, or the meanestradiol<br>
concentration in normal men, are preferred, The daily doses to be administered can<br>
initially be estimated based upon the absorption coefficients of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, the<br>
breast tissue concentration that is desired, and the plasma concentration that should not<br>
be exceeded. Of course, the initial dose may be optimized in each patient, depending on<br>
individual responses.<br>
When administering a percutaneous formulation for breast conditions, doses on<br>
the order of 0.25-2.0 mg/breast/day of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen should achieve the desired<br>
result, with doses of about 0.5-1.0 mg/breast/day being preferred. In particular<br>
embodiments, the dosage is about 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 mg/breast/day of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen.<br>
For the treatment of excessive scarring, doses on the order of 0.25 to 6 u.g of 4-<br>
hydroxy tamoxifen/cm2/day should achieve the desired result, with doses of about 0.25<br>
to 3 µg being preferred, and doses of 0.5 to 2.5 µg/cm 2/day being more preferred.<br>
Doses of about 1.0 and 2.0 µg/cm2/day are highly preferred for treating scarring<br>
conditions.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be packaged into kits for<br>
storage. Such kits comprise (a) a pharmaceutical composition as described herein, and<br>
(b) a container, wherein the pharmaceutical composition is contained within the<br>
container. The container may be a unit dose packet, such as a foil packet, or a multiple<br>
dose container, such as a container with a metered pump. Preferably, the container is<br>
impervious to light.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for making a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. In particular, there is<br>
provided a method for making a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, as<br>
described above.<br><br>
 In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for making a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, comprising the step of bringing a composition comprising<br>
4-hydroxytamoxifen to an equilibrium state, wherein about 45%-55%, about 46%-54%,<br>
about 47%-53%, about 48%-52%, about 49%-51% or about 50% of said 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen exists in a Z isomeric form and the remainder of said 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
exists in an E isomeric form. <br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
(i) providing a detennined amount of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen;<br>
(ii) providing at least one excipient;<br>
(iii) combining said 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and said at least one<br>
excipient, thereby forming a pharmaceutical composition;<br>
(iv) bringing said pharmaceutical composition to an equilibrium state,<br>
wherein about 45%-55%, about 46%-54%, about 47%-53%, about<br>
48%-52%, about 49%-51% or about 50% of said 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen exists in a Z isomeric form and the remainder of said 4-<br>
hydroxy tamoxifen exists in an E isomeric form.<br>
In one embodiment, said step (i) comprises providing a determined amount of<br>
4-hydroxy tamoxifen in a Z isomeric form, and/or providing a determined amount of 4-<br>
hydroxy tamoxifen in an E isomeric form. The 4-hydroxy tamoxifen can be provided<br>
using various relative amounts of the E and Z isomers. For example, it is possible to<br>
provide the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in only one isomer (e.g. only E or only Z). It is also<br>
possible to provide both isomers in equal or different amounts.<br>
 Excipients are known in the art. In one embodiment of the invention, said<br>
excipient is selected from the group consisting of water, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
aqueous buffers, penetration enhancers, gelling agents, oils, neutralizing agents and<br>
mixtures thereof. The various embodiments described above for the composition of the<br>
invention (ingredients, amounts thereof...) can be transposed to the methods of the<br>
invention. The skilled person would know how to proceed for providing the desired<br>
ingredients in the desires quantities.<br><br><br>
 According to the invention, said method comprises the step of bringing said<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising 4-hydroxytamoxifen to an equilibrium state.<br>
Said equilibrium state is generally a state wherein the ratio of the E/Z isomers does not<br>
significantly vary with time, because said pharmaceutical composition has reached<br>
equilibrium. In said equilibrium state, about 45%-55%, about 46%-54%, about 47%-<br>
53%, about 48%-52%, about 49%-51% or about 50% of said 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists<br>
in a Z isomeric form and the remainder of said 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists in an E<br>
isomeric form.<br>
 The kinetics according to which the equilibrium is reached depend upon various<br>
parameters, such as the initial E/Z ratio (i.e. the respective amounts of the Z and E<br>
isomers initially provided), the final pH of the composition, the nature and respective<br>
amounts of the ingredients of the composition, the dielectric constant of the composition,<br>
the temperature of manufacture, the storage temperature, and the possible exposition to<br>
light (duration, wavelength(s), ...)<br>
 The skilled person would know how to monitor the progress of the<br>
isomerization, and adjust the parameters in order to ensure that the equilibrium state is<br>
indeed reached.<br>
Examples of parameters include:<br>
-	temperatures ranging 25-40°C, e.g. 30-35°C during the manufacture, and/or<br>
-	temperatures ranging 25-40°C, e.g. 30-35°C the storage, and/or<br>
-	storage of 0.5-6 months, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 months, and/or<br>
-	exposure to light, especially UV light, during the manufacture, and/or<br>
exposure to light, especially UV light, during the storage, and/or<br>
final pH of the composition, and/or<br>
dielectric constant of the composition, and/or<br>
-	ratio water/alcohol, e.g. ratio water/ethanol, in the composition, and/or<br>
-	initial E/Z ratio of 2/98, 60/40, 63/37, 70/30, 10/90, 0/100...<br>
 The method of the invention may also comprise the step of packaging said<br>
pharmaceutical composition in a container, e.g. in a unit dose packet or in a multiple<br>
dose container with a metered pump.<br><br>
Reference to the following, illustrative examples will help to provide a more<br>
complete understanding of the invention. <br>
Example 1<br>
 This example demonstrates that isomerization of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen occurs<br>
in solution and that the isomerization ultimately reaches an equilibrium at which about<br>
50% of the 4-hydroxy tamoxifen exists in the Z isomeric form, with the remainder being<br>
in the E isomeric form.<br>
A. Preparation of Solutions Containing 4-Hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 4-hydroxy tamoxifen were prepared, based<br>
on the following gel formula:<br><br>
 In the hydroalcoholic solutions, phosphate buffer was substituted for Klucel.<br>
The composition of the buffer was as follows:<br><br>
Solutions containing five different concentrations (0.02%, 0.04%, 0.06%,<br>
0.08% and 0.10%) of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen were prepared. The composition of each<br>
solution is shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
 At each of the stated concentrations, separate solutions containing Z-4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen or a mixture of Z- and is-4-hydroxy tamoxifen were prepared. 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen from three separate manufacturers was tested:<br><br>
Because only a small quantity of Z-4-hydroxy tamoxifen was available from<br>
SIGMA, only a 0.06% solution of that batch was prepared. This solution was tested, as<br>
described below, only at 25°C and 40°C.<br>
B.	Study Conditions<br>
Each solution was subdivided into three parts in 30 ml brown glass bottles, then<br>
placed in ovens regulated at 25°, 30°, and 40°C.<br>
The relative amounts of Z- and E-4-hydroxy tamoxifen isomers were<br>
determined at the initiation of the study and at 2-week, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, 4-<br>
month and 5-month time points.<br>
C.	Analytical Methods<br>
 HPLC was employed to determine the relative amounts of each 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen isomer, using a standard solution of 4 hydroxy tamoxifen as a reference.<br>
Operating parameters for the HPLC were as follows:<br><br>
 For HPLC, the hydro alcoholic solutions were diluted in the mobile phase to<br>
obtain a 4-hydroxy tamoxifen concentration close to 2.3 µg/ml.<br><br><br>
The order of elution was as follows:<br>
4-OHT E : retention time about 13.3 min<br>
4-OHT Z : retention time about 15.0 min.<br>
Percentages of each isomer were calculated using the following formulas:<br><br>
D.	Data fitting:<br>
 The reversible isomerization reaction and the equilibrium reaches are lied by<br>
the following relationship :<br><br>
where<br>
A0 = initial concentration of the reagent<br>
Aeq = concentration of the same reagent at equilibrium<br>
A = the concentration of A at time t<br>
kf = forward rate constant<br>
kr = reverse rate constant<br>
t = time measured in months<br><br><br>
E.	Results<br>
 The tables below show results for the study; by the 6-month time point, many<br>
solutions had equilibrated at approximately a 1:1 ratio of Z and E isomers. The rate<br>
constant of the isomer inter-conversion directly depended on both temperature, initial<br>
concentration of the pure Z isomer and the initial concentration of the E/Z isomer<br>
mixture.<br>
 The individual Z and E isomer content as a function of time are presented in<br>
figures 3, 4 and 5 for 4-hydroxy tamoxifen over the concentration range of 0.02% to<br>
0.1% total. 4-Hydroxy tamoxifen solution was stored at 25°C (figures 3), 30°C (figure<br>
4) and 40°C (figure 5). The 4-hydroxy tamoxifen drug substance used to prepare the<br>
solution had an initial concentration ratio for E and Z isomers of 63 % and 37 %,<br>
respectively (PANCHIM batch 9SRD10079).<br>
As the nominal 4-hydroxy tamoxifen was varied from 0.02% to 0.10%, the<br>
magnitude of the rate constants for the reversible isomerism increased linearly. The<br>
magnitude of the rate constants also increased with temperature.<br>
 The same equilibrium ratio at approximately a 1:1 was observed starting from a<br>
4-hydroxy tamoxifen drug substance with an initial E/Z ratio of 2/98 (Batches<br>
PANCHIM 7421 ) and 0/100 (batch ICI Bx 17) (see figure 6 for example). Batches<br>
PANCHIM 7421 (E/Z ratio 2/98) and ICI Bx 17 (E/Z ratio 0/100) presented rate<br>
constants that were very similar in magnitude for each nominal 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
concentration and at each temperature investigated. Surprisingly, the closer the initial<br>
E/Z ratio is to 1:1, the higher the rate constant to reach the equilibrium is (see table 1).<br><br><br>
Example 2:<br>
This example demonstrates the effects of isopropyl myristate, the nature of the<br>
alcohol present, and the alcohol/phosphate buffer ratio on the isomerization of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen. It appears that the choice of a non-aqueous vehicle (buffer or water) does not<br>
significantly affect the isomerization process. The amount of the non-aqueous vehicle is<br>
indirectly proportional to the rate of isomerization, but the end Z/E equilibrium ratio was<br>
unaffected by the amount of non-aqueous vehicle.<br><br>
 Solutions containing 0.06 % 4-hydroxy tamoxifen were prepared as described<br>
in the table below :<br><br>
 Solutions II, III and IV described above were prepared with PANCHIM batch<br>
98RD10079 of 4-hydroxy. tamoxifen. The initial E/Z ratio was 63%/37%.<br>
Reference solution : Gel formulation without the gelling agent KLUCEL<br>
Solution II: Reference solution without Isopropyl myristate and containing ethanol<br>
Solution III : Solution II with the ethanol replaced by Isopropyl alcohol<br>
Solution IV : Solution II with the ethanol/ buffer ratio of 50/50 instead of 66.5/33.5<br>
As in Example 1, isomerization in each solution was tracked over time. The<br>
figures below show results.<br>
 The effect of replacing ethanol by isopropyl alcohol and eliminating the<br>
isopropyl myristate have no significant effect on the reversible kinetics of 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen.<br>
 Increasing the aqueous vehicle (buffer) concentration from 33.5% to 50%<br>
greatly increases the rate constant at 25°C and 30°C. The difference is less pronounced<br>
at 40°C. The increase in buffer concentration increase the electric constant of the<br>
 mixture and thus facilitates the polarization of the hydroxyl group and consequently the<br>
conjugation of the double bond of the alkene group of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. The same<br>
phenomenon was observed replacing buffer with water. It is important to note also the<br>
role of the pH of the buffer solution on the kinetics of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen reversible<br>
isomerism.<br><br>
Example 3:<br>
This example demonstrates the effects of extreme temperature on 4-hydroxy<br>
tamoxifen isomerization. Extremely high temperatures speed the equilibration process,<br>
while extremely low temperatures slow it. This example also shows that the amount of<br>
aqueous vehicle contained in the mixture affects the rate of isomerization, as noted in<br>
Example 2.<br>
 Two solutions containing 0.06% Z-4-hydroxy tamoxifen were prepared:<br>
solution V and solution VI. Solution V contained 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in pure ethanol<br>
solution. Solution VI contained 4-hydroxy tamoxifen in a mixture of 66.3% water and<br>
33.7% ethanol. The amount of isomerization that occurred in each solution was observed<br>
after one week at -20 °C, 25 °C and 60 °C. The table below shows results. After one<br>
week, no isomerization was observed at -20 °C and 25 °C, whereas a beginning of<br>
isomerization was observable and 60 °C. In view of the results published by Malet et al.,<br>
it was surprising that isomerization was not detectable in solutions V and VI after a week<br>
of storage at -20°C and 25°C.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 5:<br>
 This example demonstrates the effects of pH on 4-hydroxy tamoxifen<br>
isomerization. The amount of isomerization that occurred in solutions containing 0.06%<br>
of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen with initial E/Z ratios of 100/0 or 37/63 was observed for two<br>
months at 40°C. The 4-hydroxy tamoxifen was in a mixture of 66.5 % absolute ethanol,<br>
32.4% of either phosphate (pH 2 to 8) or carbonate (pH 10) buffer, and 1% of isopropyl<br>
myristate. Table 4, below, shows results.<br><br><br>
 Low and high pH speed the equilibration process. That is, the closer the pH is<br>
to neutral (7.0), the slower equilibration occurs. The pH, however, does not appear<br>
significantly to affect the equilibrium E/Z isomer ratio of roughly 1:1.<br>
Example 6: Methods for making a pharmaceutical compositions of 4-<br>
hydroxytamoxifen equilibrated to an E:Z isomer ratio of about 1:1<br>
