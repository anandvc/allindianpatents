Field of Hit Invention<br>
The preSept invention concerns taste improvement in foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products. More particularly, the present invention, provides flavour compositions that can be used to confer a fuEer and richer taste to foodstuffe, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products. The flavour compositions according to Hie invention are characterised by the presence of one or more substances that are capable of modifying and complementing the impact of other flavour imparting substances.<br>
The present invention also encompasses toe use of the aforementioned taste improving substances for uriproving the taste of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products, as well as to foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products containing these substances.<br>
Background oftlie invention<br>
"Umami" is a term commonly used to describe the taste impact of L-glutamate salts and certain oucleotides. Umami is the main taste in the Japanese stock called "dashi", and in bouillon and other stocks. Outamic acid is a major constituent of food proteins (plant and animal) such as those abundantly found in foods such as meat, poultry, seafood and vegetables. Two nucleotides that contribute most to the umsmi taate, GMP (guanosine monophosphate) and IMP (inosine monophosphate) are also present in many foods. By themselves these nucleotides do not typically give as powerful a flavour result as MSG (rnonosodium ghttarnate). However, due to a synergistic interaction with MSG, a pronounced enhancing effect can be observed if these nucleotides are used in combination with MSG.<br>
The umanai taste has characteristic qualities that differentiate it from other tastes. It has been convincingly shown that umami represents the fifth taste, in addition to the other four basic tastes sweet, acid, salt and bitter. The most common descriptors that are used to describe<br><br>

acids like tartaric and SUCQTOC acid have been reported to exhibit taste enhancing ptopertiqs Ctfey [1071J g. lebensra. Unters. Fqrsch, 146"; 141; Velisefc et aL [1978] Nahrang 22,; 735). Taste modifying properties have also been attributed to certain di- to octa-peptides (Yamasald and Maekawa [1978] Agric, Biol. Chem. 42: 1761; Noguchi et al. [1975] J. Agric. Food Chem. 23: 49).<br>
WO 97/04667 discloses tripeptides containing a hydrophobic etmino acid residue and at least one acidic arnino acid residue as well as N-lactoyl-X substances, wheveia X represents an amino acid resiclue, as fkyouiing ingredients to impart savoury taste and Increase the mouthfeel of foodstuffs. It is also disclosed that these peptides and derivatives can partly manic aiganoleptic features of MSG.<br>
EP-A 1 252 825 discloses flavouring compositions for imparting umanii taste to food products comprising substances that are formed by the reaction of the primary or secondary amino group of an axnino acid, peptide or protein wth the catbonyl group of a reducing sugar, According to this document the most preferred substances are those wherein the amino acid residue is selected from, glutamic acid or aspartic acid and the sugar residue is selected from fructose, glucose, maltose, lactose, galactose, rhanmosa, xylose and mannose.<br>
EP-A 1 356 744 discloses flavouring compositions containing N-acetylglycine and the use thereof for imparting umami taste to foodstuffs.<br>
As described, above nrnnmi tasta and umanii imparting substances contribute to the flavour of foodstuffs, especially in the savoury range.<br>
In sweet and beverage products, further examples of the importance of the gustatjve dimension of flavourings have been reported. These examples include taste attributes such as bitterness, tingling and cooling-freshness.<br>
Bitterness is an essential aspect of some food flavours, among which chocolate taste. Purine alkaloids, like theobromina and caffeine, as well as amino acids and peptides have been known for a long time as bitter substances. In British patent no. GB 1420909 it is disclosed that the bitter flavour of cocoa can be reproduced using a combination of a purine alkaloid and an amiiLO acid or an. oligopeptidB which 'produces a surprisingly more natural simultaneously bitter and astringent flavour note than either of these types of substances alone'.<br><br>
Mea&amp;ol, an jnijit^l^conslitweW of peppermint oil, has a strong impact on flavoured products not only becaujSfrof its mint smell, but also because it imparts a cooling and fresh taste^Neytto taint fl0voured;pxqdTUJte, jt has be&amp;i suggested to employ menthol in other types of flavour to trnpait &amp; cool taste. US patent application no. US2005013846 for example discloses how menthol and derivatives thereof can be used as flavouring in water continuous spreadable acidified food products to obtain table spreads exhibiting a fresh, cool taste impression.<br>
Similarly, cirmamic aldehyde and eugenol, constituents of cinnamon oil, are used in flavouring composition for confectionary products, not only for their smell but also because they impart a warm and tinging taste. The oral pungency of cinnamic aldehyde was described as burning and tingling by ClifFM and Heymann H [ Journal of Sensory Studies 7 (1992)279-290]. According to the same au.tib.ors eugenol exhibits a long-lasting numbing effect. Cinnamon oil has been proposed as a taste improving flavouring. International patent application no. WO9006689 discloses that cinnamon oil, among other spice extracts, added to a minty flavour formulation, can be used to improve the long-lasting flavour of chewing-gum.<br>
Although, a lot of work lias been focused on finding taste improving substances that are capable of imparting new exciting taste attributes, there still is a need for new taste improving substances, and in particular for taste improving substances that are suitable for use in both savoury and non-savoury applications.<br>

In addition, the jxrpatttt tiaste improving substances are capable of Hipdifyjug Hie taste impact of ofh.er flavour ingredients contained within these same products, hereby improving the overall flavour quality of these products.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention in a Srst aspect relates to the u0e for improving the taste of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, smoking tobacco or oral care products of a substance according to formula (I), or edible salts thereof.<br>
Rl-CRl(OR3)-CO-X	(I)<br>
wherein:<br>
Rl represents hydrogen; Q-Ca ajkyl, Cz-Cg alkenyl, C3-C8 cycloallcyl or C3-C8 cycloalkenyl,<br>
each optionally substituted with 1-8 substiruents selected from hydroxyl, Ci-Cs aflcyl; Ca-Ca<br>
allfflnyi and C i-Cj carboxyU<br>
Ra represents kydrogen^ Q-Ca aHcyl, Cj-Cj alkenyl, C3-C« cycloalkyl or Cs-Cg cycloaJkenyl,<br>
each optionally substituted with 1-8 subslituents selected from hydroxyl, Ci-Ca alkyl, CrCg<br>
alkenyl and C i-C3 carboxyi;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen; Ci-Ca acyl or Ci-C3 allcyl, each optionally substituted with 1-3<br>
hydroxyl groups;<br>
and wherein X represents either (i) a six membered heterocyclic ring, comprising at least two<br>
nitrogen atotos, which heterooyclic ring is optionally further substituted with, one or more<br>
substituents selected from the group of amiao; hydroxyl; oxo; allcyl; and monosaccharide unit,<br>
said monosaccharide unit optionally being ssterified with one or more mono-, di- and/or<br>
triphoapbate groups; or (ii) a bicyclic system comprising a five membered heterocyclic ring<br>
and a six membered heterocyclic ring, each ring comprising at least two nitrogen atoms, and<br><br>
each ting being optionally further substituted with one or more substituents selected from file group of antifto; hydroJjyl; oxo; alkyl,' and monosaccharide unit, said monosaccharide unit qptipjaajly being esterifieid wilh one or more mono-, di- and/or tripbosphate groups.<br>
The present inventors have found that the above-mentioned substances are very useful flavour ingredients which, particularly in the presence of other flavouring substances, are capable of imparting highly appreciated taste sensations to the products in which they are incorporated, specifically "roundneea", "fullness", "substance", "continuity", "complexity", "expanding", 'long lasting", 'late onset umami taste", 'leolcuini" and/or "yeasty". Because of this, the present taste improving substances can be employed to improve the taste (including "mouthfeel") of foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceutics, tobacco products and oral care products.<br>
The taste improving substances of the present invention as such are capable of imparting highly desirable taste attributes. In addition, it has been found that the taste improving substances according to the invention are capable of complementing and modifying the sensory impact of other flavouring substances contained in the aforementioned products, including complementing and modulating "sweet taste impact", "salt taste impact" and/or "bitterness".<br>
Throughout this document the temis "taste" and "flavour' are used interchangeably to describe the sensory impact that is perceived via the mouth, especially the tongue, and the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. The term "taste modifying" as used herein refers to the capability of a composition or substance to alter the taste impact of other, flavour imparting, substances present within the same product, with the proviso mat this change in taste impact is not caused by the flavour contribution of said composition or substance per se, but instead that it mainly results from me combined effect of on the one hand die taste improving composition or substance and on the other hand the other flavour imparting substances. The present substances combine the capability of modifying me taste of other Savour substances with a taste contribution of their own. The favourable impact of the present taste improving substances is believed to be the result of the combination of these two effects,<br>
Because the taste improving substances according to the invention are not particularly volatile, they do not produce a strong aroma impact, even though they can affect the aroma impact of other flavour substances. Here the term "aroma" refers to the aspect of taste that is perceived through the olfactory epithelium. Because of the low volatility of the present taste improving substances it is believed that the advantageous properties of these substances are<br><br>
