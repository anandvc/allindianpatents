				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for exchange or reaction between two fluids,<br>
  whether it concerns the exchange of calories or frigories, for example, by heating or cooling, or exchange of constitutive elements, for exemple by filtering or separation or absorption or desorption, or injection of a product(s), or a chemical reaction.<br>
Numerous devices and numerous plants have been proposed to ensure the aforementioned exchanges (or processing). Most of them, whether they function continuously or intermittently, are designed so as to ensure a single function in a satisfactory manner, without the possibility of carrying out other functions. In a reactor functioning in an intermittent mode (for example, of the "batch" type) , it is usually difficult to heat or cool reactants at the elected control level, even if this type of reactor is fitted with a double shell system or a coiled piping elements. Among the exchangers functioning continuously, are found, heat exchangers of the said "plate" and "tubes and calenders" types.<br>
In the plate heat exchangers, only non-loaded fluids or very slightly loaded fluids may be dealt with, because of the reduced spacing between plates. On the other hand, they permit a relatively easy maintenance, because of their dismountability, but the volume defined between plates is reduced and dependent on the mode of plate manufacturing. In the tube and calender heat exchangers, it is possible to deal with loaded fluids by adapting tube diameters, but the maintenance connected, in particular, with pipe choking is difficult. Moreover, the presence of tubes makes these heat exchangers relatively bulky, which limits their applications.<br>
In addition, neither of these types of heat exchangers are adapted to the other types of processings, such as filtering or<br>
separation. For these types of processings (or exchanges) which are not specifically thermal, there are numerous plants, but they are complex, bulky and poorly adaptable to processings different from those for which they were designed.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a different solution from those known.<br>
To that effect it proposes an exchange system between at least two fluids, where it is provided, on the one hand, least a "thick" first chamber, defined by the side walls of a first spacer, recessed so as to enable the flow of a first fluid and, on the other hand, at least a second "thin" or thick chamber for the flow of a second fluid, the first and second chambers being separated by a first exchanging wall enabling the exchange and/or a thermal reaction and/or by mass transfer, between fluids flowing in the first and second adjacent chambers.<br>
The volume and the arrangement of the chamber determined by the spacer are variable. Consequently, the spacer may be completely or partly recessed, or define at least two independent subchambers. In the latter case, the subchambers may be defined by machining or forming.<br>
In this way, a heat exchanger and/or  a reactor capable of processing a fluid in a reduced volume is created, providing also the advantages presented by the plate heat exchangers. In addition, according to the type of exchange wall used between the first and the second chambers (plate or diaphragm) , the processing may be either thermal or "physical" (filtering or separation of constitutive elements), or simultaneously thermal and physical. The processing may also be chemical if a reactive material is placed in the first chamber, or a mixture of materials, or if a reactant is introduced, such as a catalyst. The elements comprising these materials may be fixed on a side wall, or hung between two attached {or stacked) plates, or be inserted within  the  volume  of  the  spacer  chamber.  Injection<br>
nozzles may be considered to enable injection of one or several reactants in a chosen area of the chamber.<br>
The invention may be used for endothermic or exothermic reactions.<br>
s-	Numerous  embodiments  may  be  considered  for  the  device<br>
according to the invention, and namely:<br>
&gt;Sj*S the first spacer may comprise a first closed side wall, forming the first exchange wall and presenting an outer side arranged to cooperate with a plate, or a first or a second closed wall of a spacer of another block, so as to define the second chamber. In this case, the first spacer and the inserted plate {or the first spacer only) define a modular processing block, and several blocks may be serially mounted and/or in parallel, once their first spacer includes a second side wall, parallel {or inclined to) to the first closed side wall, and opened so as to be closed by the plate of another block (or closed to define a second chamber with the first wall of the next block) . The inserted plate may be slightly recessed in the spacer or arranged against the latter (by being possibly secured to it). Alternatively, another first spacer, of which the outer side of the first exchange wall is destined to be closed tight by the plate of the modular block to define another second chamber is considered, both first spacers and the plate thus defining a modular processing over-block;<br>
\*)the first spacer may include a first opened side wall, and at least a first and a second plate jointly defining the second chamber (either by welding or by brazing, or by stacking with interposition of a gasket) has been planned for, the first plate being additionally destined to close the first opened side wall by forming the first exchange wall. In this case, the first spacer and the first and second plates define a modular processing block, and several modular blocks may be serially mounted and/or in parallel once their first spacer comprises a<br>
second opened side wall,  facing a first opened side wall, and destined to be closed tight by the second plate of another block;<br>
one may also consider a second thick spacer comprising side walls defining a second recessed chamber so as to enable the circulation of the second fluid, the first and second spacers presenting respectively the first opened side walls destined to be placed one facing the other, with the interposition of a separation diaphragm or a plate forming the first exchange wall. In this case, the first and second spacers and the diaphragm define a modular processing block, and several modular blocks may be serially or mounted in parallel once their first spacer comprises a second side wall, either opened and destined to face a second opened side wall of another block with the interposition of another diaphragm or a tight plate, or closed and destined to face a second closed side wall of another block,- <br>
it is possible also to consider i) blocks made up of a first spacer, comprising two opened side fronts, and a second spacer including a closed side front and an opened side front, with possible interposition of an exchange diaphragm between both spacers, or ii) blocks made up of a first and second spacers, each comprising two opened side fronts, and two plates framing both spacers placed side by side, with possible interposition of an exchange diaphragm between both spacers, or iii) blocks made up of the first and second spacers, each comprising two opened side fronts, with possible interposition of an exchange diaphragm between both spacers, and two groups of two plates each framing the two spacers placed side by side spacers so as to define a fluid flow path between two blocks.<br>
In each embodiment integrating a spacer fitted with a closed side wall, the latter may be formed by machining {or recessing) or by attachment to an inserted plate, of the same material as that of the spacer or of another material . The attachment may be permanent (by welding, brazing or gluing) or temporary (stacking with interposition of a gasket).<br>
According to another feature of the invention, at least some of the plates forming an exchange wall are fitted with fluid disturbing devices, so as to encourage the thermal exchanges between the first and the second fluids. The disturbing devices may be formed on plate surfaces, for example, by pressing, or attached to the plate surfaces. Alternatively, the disturbing devices may be placed in the chambers.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, at least one of the spacers may include means for fluid injection, such as a nozzle enabling the introduction of a third fluid into the chamber of this spacer. One can be also plan for several nozzles destined to introduce fluid(s) or product(s) into chosen different locations of a spacer.<br>
According to yet another characteristic of the invention, at least  one of the spacers may include an attached static mixing element, such as for example a vortex, or metallic foam, or a catalytic foam or lining, or also a vortex generator or a stirrer, such as for example the fins of the "Offset strip fins" type. But it is also possible that a spacer includes several elements similar to those mentioned above, including elements enabling different functions. This or these elements might be included in, or realised in the form of an insert of the cartridge type.<br>
The fluid flow within a chamber may be either practically parallel to the closing plates (or side fronts), and in one pass, or not linear because it follows a flow path, for example step by step, destined to increase the time it is present within the chamber, for example. Such a path may be defined by additional cells placed in the chamber.<br>
According to yet another characteristic of the invention, at least one of the spacers may be constituted by assembling (or juxtaposition) of at least two sub-spacers, possibly of different dimensions. The volume of the chamber thus determined is chosen<br><br>
in function of flow parameters in particular: load, viscosity, residence time and likewise.<br>
The invention can be applied in many ways, and in particular in the field of thermal and/or chemical processing of a first liquid or fluid, especially foodstuffs or chemicals, or the field of separation or mixing of components of a first complex fluid, for example by filtering.<br>

The drawings attached are, essentially, of a certain character. Consequently, not only may they be used for completing the invention, but also for contributing to its definition, as the case occurs.<br>
In the description that follows, reference will be made to a fluid processing device loaded with particles. Of course, this is only one application among numerous other ones, which is in no way exhaustive.<br>
First, refer to figure 1 for the description of a first embodiment of a device according to the invention. In this first example, the device comprises a first thick spacer 1, the side walls of which demarcate a first chamber 2 recessed, so as to enable the flow of a first fluid. The dimensions of the spacer 1, and especially its thickness, are selected depending on the characteristics of the first fluid and the exchanges and/or process to be ensured. Here a spacer is understood to be a single block, or a set of several blocks or subblocks placed one next to<br>
the other. In other words, the word spacer is to be understood as an element or a set of elements defining a fluid flow chamber. As a matter of fact, this type of device may be used for processing fluids by controlling the residence time and/or the reaction time. But, it may also be used for processing fluids of high viscosity or containing fibres or particles.<br>
In the illustrated example, the first fluid enters the first chamber 2 through an inlet 3 formed in a part (here it is the upper  part  of the first spacer 1. This inlet 3 is supplied by a fi^st supplying circuit 4 which is, for example, connected to a reservoir containing a first fluid to be processed.<br>
The first spacer 1 comprises, on the other hand, in another side wall (here in its  lower  part) an outlet 5 connected to the supplying circuit 4 for driving out of the first chamber 2 the first fluid processed in it.<br>
In the example illustrated in figure 1, the processing of the first fluid consists of heating or cooling, by means of a second fluid which flows in a second recessed chamber 6, defined by the side walls of a second spacer 7. The thickness of this second spacer 7 is chosen depending on the characteristics of the fluid it is to receive. So, preferably, if both fluids are identical, spacers 1 and 7 are chosen with practically identical dimensions. The second spacer 7 is, preferably, of dimensions practically identical to those of the first spacer 1, so as to allow for assembling them easily one to the other by of appropriate means of fixation, for example by gluing, welding or screwing by means of tie-rods and nuts, possibly by fitting a gasket between them.<br>
The second spacer 7 comprises additionally an inlet 8 (here it is formed in a side wall of its upper part) , supplied by a second supplying circuit 9 with a second hot or cold fluid, as well as an outlet 10 (here formed in a side wall of its lower part), connected to the said second supplying circuit 9 to drive<br>
out the second hot fluid once it has flowed within the second chamber 6.<br>
In the example illustrated in figure 1, the exchange of calories or frigories between the second hot fluid and the first fluid is ensured via a thermal exchange wall constituted by a plate 11 made from a thermally conductive material.<br>
This plate 11 is tightly placed between the first 1 and second 7 spacers. Preferably, this plate 11 is of metallic type and comprises the disturbing devices 15 (represented on figures 8 to 10) destined to aid in the thermal exchange between the second fluid and the first fluid. These disturbing devices may be the result of a deformation obtained by pressing technology, for example, and due to this, they are part of the plate. But they may also be elements attached to a practically flat plate.<br>
Moreover, and as illustrated, the first 1 and the second 7 spacers include each a first opened side wall 12, 13 so as to allow for the fluids to lap against the parallel sides of plate 11 which closes the first 2 and second 6 chambers. Each spacer 1, 7 includes, additionally, a second closed side wall 13, placed practically in parallel to the first opened side wall 1. Alternatively, the first 12 and second 13 side walls of each spacer could be opened, the second side walls 13 of both spacers so being closed by a plate of the type 11 of plate forming the thermal exchange wall.<br>
The first 1 and second 7 spacers and the plate 11 placed between these spacers form a modular block B. As illustrated in Figure 1, several modular blocks B may be associated in one and the same device, either in parallel (as illustrated) , or serially, or serially and in parallel. More specifically, in the illustrated example, three modular blocks Bl to B3 are attached one to the other and supplied in parallel with fluid by the first<br>
4	and second 9 supplying circuits. Of course, alternatively, the blocks could be arranged so as to function serially, the outlets<br>
5	and 10 of the first block Bl supplying the inlets 3 and 8 of<br>
the second block B2 , the outlets of the second block B2 supplying the inlets of the third block B3 and the outlets of the third block B3 supplying the first 4 and second 9 circuits.<br>
Furthermore, a device of this type could be used to ensure a mass transfer between the first and second fluids, or a heat exchange and a mass transfer. To this end, the heat exchange plate 11 is substituted by a diaphragm chosen in function of the type of exchange desired. This may be, for example, a filtering diaphragm which authorises only a one-way passage of a given constitutive element of the first fluid towards the second, in view of separating constitutive elements or a mixture of constitutive elements. Such a diaphragm may be either inserted between both spacers 1 and 7, or previously attached to one of either spacer.<br>
On the other hand, it is also possible to provide an attached (or insert) element 14 (shown in dotted line) inside one of the first 2 and second 6 chambers. Such an insert may, for example, be constituted of a cartridge including a processing material such as a catalytic foam or a reactant. It may also be a vortex generator, or a stirrer. Otherwise, when several modular blocks Bi are serially and/or in parallel mounted, the successive chambers may include inserts of different types.<br>
As illustrated in figures 9 and 10, it is possible to use several (sub-) spacers placed side to side to define a same chamber. The thickness of the first or second chambers may also vary from one block to another. Of course, the (sub) spacers must have opened first and second side walls. Alternatively, the spacers which determine a chamber (first or second) may be different, one having both opened and closed side walls, the other having all side walls opened.<br>
It is also possible to use identical first 1 and second 7 spacers.<br>
At least one of the first and/or second spacers may also comprise means of injection (see figures 12 to 15, and 20) , such<br>
as, for example, a nozzle that can introduce at a chosen location of a chamber (preferably a first chamber 2) a product specifically destined, for example, to control a chemical reaction within the said chamber. Several nozzles may be provided in one spacer, so as to inject one or several different fluids at chosen locations (see figure 15) . For example, a nozzle may be used for supplying reactant for a chemical reaction at a chosen location depending on the type of this reaction.<br>
Such nozzles are particularly adapted to devices equipped with a cooling circuit for exothermic reactions or a heating circuit for endothermic reactions, such as, for example those illustrated in figures 2 to 10. The device shown in figure 1 might also be used, subject to the intermediate plate 11 being of the electric type (in this case, both fluids flowing in the spacers 1 and 7 are identical).<br>
We now refer to figure 2 to describe a second embodiment of a device according to the invention. In this example, the device comprises a thick spacer 21 the side walls of which determine a first chamber 22, so recessed as to allow for the flow of a first fluid. As in the previous example, the spacer 21 includes an inlet 23 connected to a first supplying circuit 24 with a first fluid and an outlet 25 to drive the first processed fluid out of the first chamber 22.<br>
This first chamber 22 is determined by the practically parallel first 26 and second 27 side walls. Of course, these side walls could be differently inclined, for example significantly opposed, relating to a vertical direction. The first side wall 26 is formed so as to define at its outer face a second chamber 28 destined to receive a second fluid. The spacer 21 comprises, therefore, a second inlet 29 connected to a second supplying circuit 30 with a second fluid and a second outlet 31 for driving the second fluid out of the second chamber 28.<br>
In  the  simplest  configuration,  the  device  is  a  heat exchanger which only includes one spacer 21 and a plate destined<br>
to cooperate with the outer face of the first wall 26 of the spacer 21 to define the second chamber 28 (or in other words, to ensure sealed closure of the chamber 28) . The example which is illustrated in figure 2 is more sophisticated in so far as it proposes a device comprising four serially mounted modular blocks Bl to B4, each modular block Bi (i=l to 4) being constituted of a spacer 21, the second closed wall 27 of a spacer 21 closing the second chamber 2 8 of the previous block, and the second chamber 28 of the last block (here B4) being closed by a final plate 32. In a « loop-like » alternative, the final plate 32 may also act as an inlet plate to Bl, thus allowing for a complete framing of the second circuit by the first and last channels.<br>
As a consequence, in this example, the first 25 and second<br>
31	outlets of the first block Bl respectively supply the first 23<br>
and second 29 inlets of the second block B2 and so on, the first<br>
25 and second 31 outlets of the last modular block  (here B4)<br>
being respectively connected to the first 24 and second 30 fluid<br>
supplying circuits.<br>
It is obvious that in the example illustrated in figure 2, the dimensions of the second chamber 28, and in particular it thickness, are determined by the configuration of the outer face of the second wall 26 of the spacer 21.<br>
A parallel distribution of co-current or against-current type may be considered.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 3 is an alternative to the device illustrated in figure 2. In this alternative, the first wall 26 of each thick spacer 21 is closed, while the second wall 27 of this spacer is opened and closed by a plate 32, for example a metallic one. In a loop-like alternative, the final plate 32 may also act as an inlet plate to Bl, thus allowing for a full framing of the second circuit by the first and last channels.<br>
A modular block Bi is therefore constituted here of a plate<br>
32	and  a  spacer  21.  The  blocks  Bi  may  be  serially  (as<br>
illustrated) mounted and/or in parallel, as in the example of<br>
figure 1. In the illustrated example in figure 4, the device comprises thick spacers 41, of a practically symmetric shape, due to the fact that they include first 42 and second 43 side walls which are preferably significantly identical and each determining, by their outer conformed face, a part at least of a second chamber 46. Each spacer 41 comprises, as in the illustrated examples in figures 2 and 3, i) a first inlet 47 connected to a first supplying circuit 48 with a first fluid to supply a first chamber 45, ii) a second inlet 49 connected to a second supplying circuit 50 with a second fluid, iii) a first outlet 51 for driving the first fluid out of the first chamber 45, and iv) a second outlet 52 to drive the second fluid out of the second chamber 46. As a matter of fact, each spacer 41 may include other inlets and outlets for the second fluid, in so far as it defines by the outer faces of its first 42 and second 43 side walls, two second chambers 46 (at least partly) in which the second fluid may flow in parallel and preferably in the same direction.<br>
In this example, each spacer 41 constitutes itself a modular block Bi. Here, four modular blocks Bl to B4 are serially mounted, outlets of one supplying inlets of the other. But, alternatively, the blocks could be mounted in parallel.<br>
The outer face of the first side wall 42 of a first block determines with its outer face of the second side wall 43 of the following block a second chamber 46. In other words, each outer face, which is not placed at one end of the device, determines a second "half-chamber". The second chambers 46 determined by the second 43 and first 44 side walls of the spacers 41, placed at both opposed ends of the device {in fact, Bl and B4) , are each closed by a plate 53, so that both second chambers 46 they jointly determine at the ends of the device, are approximately twice smaller in volume than those of the other second "intermediate" chambers 46.<br>
The device of figure 4 may also be seen as an assembly of modular processing "over-blocks" constituted each of two first spacers 41 and the plate 53.<br>
In an alternative to the device in figure 4, it is possible to insert, between two spacers 41, a diaphragm, so as to subdivide into two parts the second chamber determined by the outer faces of the preformed side walls of the successive spacers. Thus, it is possible to consider in particular an exchange of molecules, atoms or ions between fluids (for example different gases) which flow in both parts of a second chamber.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 5A is an alternative to the device illustrated in figure 4. Here, a plate 53 is provided between two thick adjacent spacers 41 with preformed outer walls. Consequently, in this embodiment, a modular block Bi is constituted by a spacer 41 and a plate 53. Each spacer 41 so determines a first chamber 45 and two second chambers 56 which are each closed by a plate 53 which belongs to the next block (or previous one) , or by a final plate of the device, as described above in reference to figure 4. In this example, a first fluid flows in the chambers 45, preferably in the same direction, for example from to to bottom, while a second fluid flows in an alternating manner in the second chambers 56, for example from top to bottom, then from bottom to top, then from top to bottom, and so on.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 5B is an alternative to the device illustrated in figure 5A, relating to the question of the circulation of fluids. In this example, a first fluid flows in the chambers 45, preferably in the same direction, for example from top to bottom, while a second fluid flows in a second direction, preferably in the opposite direction to the first direction, in the chambers 56.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 6A is another alternative to the device illustrated in figure 5A. Here, the second chambers 56 are determined by pairs of plates 53, that are placed on each<br>
side of the opened side walls of the thick spacers 61, determining each a first opened chamber 45. As a consequence, in this embodiment, a modular block Bi is constituted by a pair of plates 53, a spacer 61 and a plate 53. In this example, a first fluid flows in the chambers 45, preferably in the same direction, for example from up downwards, while a second fluid flows in an alternate manner in the second chambers 56, for example from top to bottom, then from bottom to top, then again from top to bottom, and so on.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 6B is an alternative to the device illustrated in figure 6A, relating to the question of the circulation of fluids. In this example, a first fluid flows in the chambers 45, preferably in the same direction, for example from top to bottom, while a second fluid flows in a second direction, preferably in an opposite direction to the first direction, in the chambers 56.<br>
In the example illustrated in figures 7 a 9, the device still comprises a spacer 61 the side walls of which determine a first recessed chamber 62, but this time, the second chamber 66, in which flows the second fluid, is defined by two plates 64 and 65, of the type of those used in traditional plate exchangers. These two plates 64 and 65 may be firmly attached before being mounted to the spacers 61.<br>
In this example,  a spacer 61 and two plates 64 and 65, which determine a second chamber 66, constitute a modular block Bi . Here, three modular blocks Bl to B3 were serially mounted, but, of course, they could be more numerous, and/or mounted in parallel or mounted serially and in parallel.<br>
The spacer 61 of the first block Bl comprises an inlet 67 connected to the first supplying circuit 68 with a first fluid, so as to supply the first chamber 62, and an outlet 69 to drive the first processed fluid out of the first chamber 62 . In the same way, the plates 64 and 65, which determine the second chamber 66, comprise an inlet 70 connected to a second supplying<br>
circuit 71 with a second fluid to supply the said second chamber 66, and an outlet 72 to drive the second fluid out of the second chamber 66.<br>
Of course, in this example, the spacers 61 have first and second side walls opened and destined to be closed by one of the plates 64 or 65 of a previous block, or by a final plate 73 . An end plate, acting as an inlet plate, may enable the full framing by the first and last channels of the second fluid supplying circuit.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in figures 8 and 9, a final plate 73 may be substituted by two other plates 64 and 65 which determine a second additional chamber 66.<br>
In the examples illustrated in figures 1 to 7, the inlets and outlets were marked by arrows to facilitate understanding of the flow directions of the different fluids. Of course, and as illustrated in figures 8 to 10, the different inlets and outlets may be favourably integrated in the spacers and in the plates, as is well known by those of the art.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 9 is an alternative to that illustrated in figure 8, in which each thick spacer 61 is constituted by two sub-spacers 61-a and 61-b so as to increase the thickness of each first chamber 62.<br>
The device illustrated in figure 10 is an alternative to that illustrated in figure 9, in which are provided first thick spacers 61, constituted (in this case) by two sub-spacers 61-a and 61-b in order to increase the thickness of each first chamber 62, alternating with second thick spacers 81, constituted (in this case) by two sub-spacers 81-a and 81-b in order to increase the thickness of each second chamber 82, by inserting a plate between each successive first 61 and second 71 spacers.<br>
All that has been indicated in the description relating to the first example of the device illustrated in figure 1, also applies to the other examples of embodiments illustrated in figures 2 to 10.  In particular,  certain chambers formed in the<br>
spacers may contain one or more inserts, and certain spacers may be equipped with nozzles for injecting a specific product destined, for example, for controlling a chemical reaction in a chamber.<br>
Four examples of insert realisation are shown in figures 11A to 11D.<br>
In figures 12 to 15 are also shown examples of spacers equipped with nozzles. More specifically, in figure 12 is illustrated a conical-shaped nozzle 100, in figure 13 is shown a vertical cylindrical nozzle 101, in figure 14 is illustrated a horizontal cylindrical nozzle 102, and in figure 15 are illustrated a first upper horizontal nozzle 102 of the cylindrical type and a second intermediate horizontal nozzle 103.<br>
Otherwise, as mentioned previously, in all the examples of the devices previously described, tightness between consecutive spacers or between a spacer and a plate may be ensured either through a sealing means (a flat peripheral gasket or an o'ring, metallic or not, located on one of the two elements) , or by gluing or welding.<br>
Furthermore, the different spacers may be made of a polymer type material, for example PEEK (English acronym for PolyEtherEtherKetone). But numerous other materials may also be considered, such as, for example glass, ceramics, or metal (stainless steel, titanium, aluminium, for example). The embodiment of these spacers depends on the material(s) used: machining and/or welding and/or forming and/or pressing.<br>
Moreover, the flow of fluid inside the device may be either completely alternate (upwards / downwards / upwards / downwards...), which corresponds to a "serial" flow, as previously indicated, or partly alternating (upwards then downwards or downwards then upwards), which corresponds to a "parallel/serial" flow type. More generally, all the combinations of serial and parallel/serial modes may be considered (the illustrated examples are not exhaustive). It is also possible to<br>
consider a subdivision of a spacer chamber into two parts, as illustrated in figure 16, for example by installing a partition 110 in the chamber. The spacer may be composed of closed side walls, possibly preformed, or of opened side walls, or it may also have an opened side wall and a closed side wall, possibly preformed. Of course, in this case, each opened wall may be closed either by a diaphragm or by a plate. The plate may be an inserted part, or an integral part of the spacer (in this case, it is obtained by forming or by machining) . Otherwise, the wall may include surface deformations forming, for example, disturbing devices and/or guides.<br>
As has been previously described, and as illustrated in figures 17A to 17D, the spacers fitted with partly opened side walls may be realised in two ways. In a first embodiment (see figure 17A) , the opened side walls are practically flat (not conformed) and may be closed by a diaphragm or a plate. In a second embodiment (see figures 17B and 17C) , the opened side walls are conformed so as to install a plate or a diaphragm, possibly preformed. The embodiments illustrated in figures 16 and 17 may be combined.<br>
It is also possible to use spacers (opened or closed) with six supplying collection inlets, of the type of that illustrated in figure 18. More specifically, in this embodiment the two left apertures enable the flow of the second fluid between any second chamber, the two right apertures enable the flow of a third fluid between any second chamber, and the two centre apertures are used for supplying the first chamber with a first fluid as well as for collecting this first fluid. This type of spacer may also receive one or more nozzles, as illustrated in figure 19.<br>
As it was previously indicated, the first chamber may present different conformations. Among others, it may be rectangular, circular or oval. But it may also contain some disturbing devices, or guides 12 0 which may determine a flow path for the first fluid, as illustrated in figure 20 (here the guides<br>
are an integral part of the spacer which is realised by forming or machining, but they could be one or more inserted parts).<br>
Finally, for questions of maintenance, it is preferable that the devices according to this invention be of the "one-piece" type, and assembled by means of tie-rods at which end nuts are screwed on. So, by pressing plates and/or spacers one against the other, a tight assembly is constituted that does not need any welding or gluing and, due to this fact, allows for quick dismantling. Of course, it could be quite possible to consider the use of brazed or welded plate heat exchangers. But such a heat exchanger comprising stacked plates, simply assembled by pressing them one against the other, may be cleaned more easily. Moreover this type of modular assembly is particularly advantageous and can be adjusted or adapted to changes of use.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments of devices described above which are given only as examples, but it comprises all the alternatives that may be considered by those of the art within the scope of the claims hereunder.<br>
The invention has thus been described as applied to devices for fluids containing particles. But it is obvious that numerous other fluids, or mixtures of fluids of any kind, are concerned by the invention, and especially foodstuffs, chemicals and metallurgy. As a matter of fact, the invention enables chemical reactions to be permanently controlled via heat exchange as well as by injecting one or several reactants. Moreover, the fluids may be in liquid, gaseous, solid/liquid or liquid/gaseous forms.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also applies to desorption and to absorption, these operations being ensured independently from other the operations previously mentioned, or in complement to them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
