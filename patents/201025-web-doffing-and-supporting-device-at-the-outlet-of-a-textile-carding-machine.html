				<td>The invention relates to a Web doffing and supporting device at the outlet of a Textile carding machine. This invention is more particularly directed to a device for taking off and gathering of fibre web discharged by a fibre delivery mechanism of the textile carding machine with built in dedicated drive for driving the delivery calendar rollers present downstream of the machine immediately after the condenser.<br>
The Carding machines are provided with feeding device comprising a feed roller and a feed plate cooperating therewith. The fibre batt supplied to the carding machine is firmly held between the feed roller and the feed plate and due to the rotation of the feed roller the fibre batt is slowly advanced into the licker-in zone. The Carding machines are provided with a licker-in roller. The fibre batt is opened by the clothing of the licker in roller and the opened fibres are carried by the licker- in roller and delivered to the card cylinder, clothed with wire points for subsequent opening and so on. For the removal of waste and dirt from the opened batt, stationary carding elements, also known as combing segment associated with mote knife and discharge opening is present in the carding machine.<br>
The lickerin roller present immediately next to the feed roller rotates significantly faster than the feed roller and the fibres opened by the licker-in passes through the stationary carding element, mote knife and the discharge opening present in the licker-in under casing zone. The opened fibres carried by the licker-in roller is further opened by the stationary carding elements gently. The loose fibres carried by the licker- in roller is stripped by the mote knife and dropped in to the discharge opening, which may be collected in a chamber provided and removed by suitable suction means. The fibre material is subsequently carried by the card cylinder. The fibres carried by the cylinder in cooperation with revolving flats is fully opened and parallelized . The fibres are subsequently doffed by the doffer and detaching device and presented to the calendar roller pair in sliver form, through a web doffing device which is normally present in high production cards . The detaching device is arranged downstream to the doffer Normally the detaching device comprises a redirecting roller and a pair of crush rollers and driven by the doffer drive system of the carding machine at a pre determined speed. A top and bottom calendar roller, which forms the calendar roller pair being located at the out let of the carding machine. Generally the calendar rollers are also driven by the doffer drive system at a pre determined speed. The sliver delivered by the calendar rollers is transferred to the revolving sliver cans through the coiler calendar rollers and can coiler.<br>
The web delivered by the carding machine is very thin and web gathering devices are in use in modem high production carding machines to minimize sagging of the web<br><br>
which is being delivered by the crush rollers to the calendar rollers through a condenser.<br>
One such known device for gathering the fibre web discharged by the fibre delivery mechanism employing transverse conveyor is known. In this device the fibre emerging from the nip of at least two rotating rollers is deposited in the top run of one or two transverse conveyor which moves axially of the roll between guide rollers in order to convey the fibre web laterally away for the card. In practice it has been found very advantageous to use a transverse conveyor for guiding the fibre to one end of the card or to the middle of the card by using two transverse conveyor, after which the web is turned through about 90Â° at the turning place of the transverse conveyor and is conveyed through a condenser to nip of the rotating delivery rollers. In practice, in the construction of many cards equipped with such transverse conveyors, particularly where the surface of the top run is inclined, a stationary guide plate is disposed on the longitudinal side of the top run facing the doffer, covers the gap between the top run and the adjacent rollers. However it has been found that fibre particles occur on the transverse conveyor at the edge of the fibre web. These pocket may work loose and travel along with the fibre web, and this has an adverse effect on the subsequent processing of the fibre. Such fibre packets are therefore undesirable. To overcome the problem of occurrence of fibre packets on the transverse conveyor at the edge of fibre web the use of transverse conveyor with shoulder of trapezoidal cross section with an inner side for guiding the web instead of the guide plates is known<br>
The carding machines employing such traverse conveyors essentially requires a drive mechanism for driving to the transverse conveyors and the calendar rollers. The means of providing drive to the transverse conveyor from the doffer gearing is complicated and involves many drive element resulting in high cost and the requirement of more maintenance. For high speed application it is generally desirable that tension be applied to the web between the delivery roller and the sliver forming nip. In the known devices the calendar rollers are driven by gearing ofthe doffer and there exists limitation in adjusting the speed of the calendar rollers to incorporate necessary tension draft. Moreover the devices described above have limitations on the delivery speeds because of the gearings and mechanical components.<br>
The present invention is directed towards a simple means for taking off and gathering of fibre web discharged by a fibre delivery mechanism of a Textile Carding machine to minimize the sagging of the web in the region between the pair of revolving crush rollers and pair of revolving calendar rollers without the use of traverse conveyor and the delivery calendar rollers present downstream immediately after the condenser of the present invention are driven by independent drive means. By this it is possible to use the web guiding and supporting device even at higher delivery speeds of the order 300 m/min and above.<br><br>
Accordingly the invention provides a Web doffing and supporting device at the out let of a textile carding machine arranged in between a pair of revolving crush rollers and a pair of revolving calendar rollers, the said crush rollers being rotatably mounted on a detaching device and driven at a pre determined speed , the said pair of revolving calendar rollers rotatably mounted and located at the out let of 9 textile carding machine and driven at a pre determined speed , a condenser being arranged in between the said crush rollers and the said calendar rollers , characterized in that the web doffing and supporting device comprises a web collecting sheet which is being mounted on the frame of the said web doffing and supporting device and arranged at a distance 'D' downstream of the said crush rollers, the said condenser being mounted on the frame of the said web doffing and supporting device at a pre determined location in between the said web collecting sheet and the said calendar rollers , the said calendar rollers being rotatably mounted within the said web doffing and supporting device at a pre determined location and the said top calendar roller is driven by an independent variable speed motor .<br>
