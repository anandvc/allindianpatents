The invention relates to an optoelectronic apparatus for static and dynamic measurements. The apparatus according to the invention may be used for non-destructive measurements under both static and dynamic loadings. It also measures slope, which is mainly used for static loading.<br>
For displacement measurements light from a laser beam is split into a reference beam  and an object beam.    The reference beam  is attenuated and passed through plurarility of mirrors to have path length equal to the path length of the object beam when the object is under no load. The object beam is expanded and made to illuminate the object. The reflected light from the object is passed through a prism and lens assembly, reflected light from the object beam and the reference beam a-e recombined on a wedge beam splitter located before an image capturing means connected to a computer to obtain displacement measurements under loaded conditions by interferometry.   For slope measurement the reference beam is blocked.  The object beam is expanded and   made to illuminate the object.    The reflected light from the object is passed through an assembly of a prism and mutually perpendicular mirrors and recombined after passing through the lens assembly on the wedge beam splitter located before the image capturing means connected to the<br><br>
computer for measuring slope by interferametry. The image capturing means preferably comprises a camera and an image-grabbing card connected to a computer. The image capturing means may be a web camera connected to a computer. The image-grabbing card may also have real time capabilities. An actuator connected to the computer is attached to the object during dynamic measurements.<br>
The invention provides an optoelectronic apparatus for static and dynamic measurements comprising a laser mounted on a rigid base, a reflecting mirror to reflect the laser beam from the laser to a beam splitter for splitting the laser beam into a reference beam and an object beam a beam exp^der to expand the object beam and illuminate an object on which measurement is to be carried out, a prism for directing the reflected beam from the object to a wedge beam splitter through a lens assembly, a neutral density filter and plurality of mirrors located in the path of the reference beam from the beam splitter to attenuate and match the path length of the reference beam with the path length of the object beam and direct it to the wedge beam splitter a tiltable mirror located at a distance from the side of the prism opposite to the side<br><br>
receiving the reflected light from the object with the plane of the mirror perpendicular to the axis of the reflected beam from the object, a fixed mirror  with the plane of the mirror perpendicular to that of the tillable mirror and located at a distance from the side adjacent to the side of the prism receiving the reflected light from the object,   a removable screen located between the beam spliter   and the neutral density filter   and another removable screen located   between the prism    and the titlable mirror,  an image capturing means  located  with its axis parallel to the axis of the reflected   beam  from the object directed to the wedge beam splitter a computer   connected to the out put of said image     capturing means for   interferometric measurements of displacement and slope and an actuator  connected to the computer   for vibrating the object   during dynamic measurements.<br>
The optoelectronic apparatus for static and dynamic measurements will be described with reference to the only figure shown in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Laser beam from a laser (LA) is reflected on mirror (Mi) and split into two beams reference beam (BR) and object beam (BO), by a beam<br><br>
splitter (BS1).   A  removable  screen   (S1)  provided  for blocking  the reference beam is kept out of the path of reference beam (BR) during the displacement measurement.  The reference beam (BR) passes through a neutral density filter (NDF) for attenuation and passed through a set of mirrors (M2 to Mg) for matching the path length with the object beam (BO).   The reference beam (BR) with corrected   path length is passed through a beam expander (BEX2) to a wedge beam splitter (BS2) kept before an image capaturing means (C).  The object beam (BO) from the beam  splitter (BS1) is passed through a beam  expander (BEX1) to illuminate the object   (0) and the reflected beam from the object (0) passes through a prism (P) directing the reflected beam from the object to a lens assembly (L) provided for focusing the object (0). The reflected beam from the object is directed to the image capturing means through the beam splitter (BSj) resulting in interference with the reference beam (BR).    During the displacement measurement, screen (S2) is located between the prism (P) and mirror (M7) to block mirror (M7). The image capturing means ( C) and the associated computer (PC) provides the measure of displacement.<br><br>
For slope measurement the laser beam from the laser (LA) is reflected on mirror (M1) and is passed through the beam splitter (BS1) and beam expander (BEX1) to illuminate the object (O). During this measurement, screen (S1) is kept in the path of the reference beam (BR) from the beam splitter (BS1) to block the reference beam and screen (S2) between the prism (P) and mirror (M7) is removed from the plath of the reflected beam from the object (0). The reflected beam from the object is sheared by the assembly of the prism (P) and the two mutually perpendicular mirrors (M7 and Mg) The mirror (M7) is tiltable and tilting this mirror will produce sheared images which is captured by the image capturing means (C) for measuring slope by interferometry with the aid of the computer (PC).<br>
The image capturing means (C ) is preferably a charge coupled device (CD) camera associated with an image grabbing card (IGC). The image grabing card may be with real time capabilities or a multimedia IGC with non realtime capabilities. The image capturing means (C) may also be a web camera. An actuator (A) connected to the computer (PC) provides excitation to the object during dynamic measurements.<br><br>
