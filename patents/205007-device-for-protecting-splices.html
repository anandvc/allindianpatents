THE PATENTS ACT,   1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
'DEVICE FOR PROTECTING SPLICES"<br>
CORNING CABLE SYSTEMS S.A., a French company of Favieres,  28170 Chatcauneufen  Thyymcrais, France<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a device for protecting splices, particularly splices in telephone cables.<br>
Devices of this kind are conventionally installed at the junction of cables for protecting the connections in the wires from chemical attack from the outside and the mechanical stresses to which they may be subjected.<br>
These protective devices may be used for cables installed in underground ducts, in the ground, in the air or on the outside of buildings.<br>
They have to meet a certain number of requirements, in particular they must be gas- and water-tight both when immersed (for use in underground ducts) and when subjected to running water (for use in the air or on the outside of buildings) and should have sufficient mechanical strength to allow tensile, flexural or torsional stresses to be exerted on the cables within certain limits.<br>
It is also essential for these devices to be chemically neutral to any possible attacks from the media where they are used (chemical neutrality relative to a basic medium (pH13) and an acid medium (pHl), or relative to exposure to UV radiation or to hydrocarbons, for limited periods).<br>
To meet these requirements protective devices have conventionally been proposed in the form of sleeves made up of two substantially semi-cylindrical half-shells made of synthetic material and closed off at their ends by cheeks or stoppers formed around the diameter of the cables.  To ensure a leaktight seal between the half-shells, a joint of synthetic material or mastic may be intercalated between them; the assembly thus formed<br><br>
is generally locked in position around the cables by a resilient closure means applied to the outer surface of the half-shells.<br>
To perfect the tightness of the protective device thus formed, it has already been proposed that the half-shells be lined on the inside with a polymeric sealing material which may advantageously be in the form of a gel in which the cables are embedded.<br>
By way of example, a protective device of this type is described in the publication WO-93/14547.<br>
Devices of this kind are totally satisfactory from the point of view of their resistance to the stresses to which they may be subjected, but they have the disadvantage of requiring a flat and non-bulky splicing plane and furthermore they are particularly costly in view of the number of components which make them up and particularly the cost of the sealing material which is generally a particularly expensive resin.<br>
The present invention sets out to overcome these disadvantages by proposing a splice protecting device, particularly for protecting splices in telephone cables, which is inexpensive and quick to install while having sufficient resistance to external attacks both chemical and mechanical.<br>
According to the invention, this device is characterised in that it comprises, on the one hand, two substantially semi-cylindrical identical half-shells respectively delimited on either side by two longitudinal bearing surfaces by which they press against each other, so as to define on their inside a cable accommodating channel, level with the splices, and to ensure the longitudinal tightness of the device around the splices and, on the other hand, two sealing washers having a diameter which corresponds to the cross-section of the accommodation channel, which are provided with a series of median openings through which the cables to be connected can pass, and which ensure<br><br>
the transverse tightness of the device around the splices.<br>
According to the invention, the sealing washers consist of hollow members, generally made of plastics, which are filled with a polymer material, particularly a polyurethane-type gel or elastomer capable of being pierced by the cables which are to be connected and outwardly flush, on the one hand, with the through-openings for these cables and, on the other hand, with at least one peripheral annular recess.<br>
Moreover, the half-shells are provided, on their inside, level with the respective ends of the accommodation channel, with substantially semi-circular transverse mouldings allowing the positioning of the sealing washers and cooperating with the peripheral annular recesses thereof so as to displace and deform the polymer sealant and ensure transverse tightness of the device at this level.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, one of the bearing surfaces of the half-shells or first bearing surface comprises, over substantially its entire length, a groove filled with a sealant, particularly a mastic, while the other bearing surface or second bearing surface is provided with a corresponding rib, again over substantially its entire length, the rib of one of the half-shells cooperating with the groove of the other half-shell so as to displace and deform the sealant and ensure longitudinal tightness of the device around the splices.<br>
A device of this kind is capable of accommodating a large number of cables; it is distinguished essentially by the presence, in its central part, of a closed space accommodating the splices, which is sealed off by sealing zones filled with polymer gel or mastic and is thus sufficiently protected from external attack.  The quantity of sealing material required according to the invention is significantly less than that used in the<br><br>
prior art devices, in which the inner part of the protective sleeve is totally filled with such a material.<br>
It should also be noted that the mastic which provides the longitudinally seal is substantially less expensive than the polymer gel which ensures the transverse seal.<br>
According to the invention, the width of the bearing surfaces is generally of the order of 4 to 10 mm.<br>
In the particular case of the connection of telecommunications cables, the semi-cylindrical shells may advantageously consist of components made of polypropylene or another synthetic material having a width of 5 to 10 cm and a length of 20 to 60 cm.  The depth of the grooves is, on average, of the order of 4 to 6 mm while the height of the ribs is of the order of 2 to 3 mm.<br>
According to the invention, when the two half-shells are pressed against each other by their bearing surfaces, the ribs, by penetrating into the opposing grooves, displace and deform the sealing material, particularly the mastic, which ensures and maintains a permanent contact between this material and the ribs and consequently produces a barrier which ensures longitudinal tightness of the sealed space present inside the sleeve against liquids and gases.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the bearing surfaces of the semi-cylindrical half-shells are fitted, along their outer edges, with alternate male and female ratchet-type connecting means adapted to cooperate in pairs to lock the device around the cables simply by pressure.<br>
It is, of course, necessary, when the half-shells are positioned facing each other on either side of the cables, for each male member to cooperate with a female member and vice versa.<br><br>
According to another feature of the invention, the bearing surfaces are each provided with at least one attachment ring.<br>
This ring enables the device to be attached to and particularly suspended from the outside of a building, for example.<br>
The essential feature of the device which forms the subject of the invention, however, is connected with the nature of the means used to ensure the transverse seal around the splices and in particular the prior filling of the sealing washers, at the factory, with a sealant in the form of a substantially incompressible flexible gel having high elongation characteristics.<br>
In fact, this gel is subjected to a first displacement and deformation stress when it is drilled by the cables to be connected, which are passed through the gel before the splices are made, and it thus tends to be evacuated outwardly at the peripheral annular recesses.<br>
It then undergoes a second stress of the same type when, once the splices have been made, the device is closed up again following the pressing together of the two half-shells by their respective bearing surfaces: in fact, the transverse mouldings then penetrate into the annular recesses located opposite in order to displace the sealing gel; this ensures and maintains permanent contact between the gel and the transverse mouldings and consequently produces a barrier which ensures a transverse seal of the enclosed space present inside the device against liquids and gases.<br>
This barrier is all the more effective as the degree of deformation of a polymer sealing gel increases, and consequently the contact forces between this material and the cables, on the one hand, and the transverse mouldings, on the other hand, are substantial.<br>
According co a preferred feature of the invention,<br><br>
each of the sealing washers consists of a combination of two identical half-washers arranged head to tail and preferably fitted together by ratchet means.<br>
It should be noted that the two half-washers may if desired be pre-assembled at the factory.<br>
According to another particularly advantageous feature of the invention, each sealing half-washer consists of a circular plate drilled with median openings through which the cables to be connected can pass and the inner surface of which is fitted with a peripheral flange and is extended by flexible leaves extending radially from the peripheral flange between the median openings.<br>
In this configuration, the two half-shells are in the form of cylinders, wherein one of the lateral surfaces immediately adjacent to the peripheral flange consists of gel, and they are put together level with these gel surfaces.<br>
It should be noted that during this assembly the gel is also subjected to a prior displacement and deformation stress of the same kind as the stresses to which it is subjected when drilled by the cables to be connected and during the closure of the half-shells.<br>
According to the invention, the flange of each half-washer may advantageously be 1 to 2 cm wide, thus ensuring the presence of a sufficient mass of gel inside the hollow washers.<br>
According to the invention, it is advantageous to subdivide the median openings into a central opening surrounded by a series of peripheral openings uniformly distributed around a circle and respectively separated by a flexible leaf;   these leaves thus constitute radial partitions defining compartments each of which is capable of accommodating one of the cables to be connected, which can thus be perfectly embedded in the gel.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the<br><br>
median openings' consist of pennant-shaped members in a star configuration.<br>
This feature ensures that the gel is held inside the device to the optimum degree and consequently guarantees maximum contact between the gel and the cables which are to be connected.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, the peripheral flange comprises a main annular part integral with the inner surface of the circular plate and an auxiliary annular part separated from the main annular part by   a peripheral annular recess of specified width which is attached to the latter by the flexible leaves which have a cut-out level with this recess.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the half-shells are provided, at each end of the accommodation channel, with four regularly spaced parallel transverse mouldings, namely, on the one hand, two inner mouldings capable of penetrating into the peripheral annular recesses of the sealing half-washers to ensure transverse tightness of the device and, on the other hand, two outer mouldings the function of which is to ensure the positioning of these sealing half-washers around the splices.<br>
The features of the device to which the invention relates will be  described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

ribs and grooves provided on the bearing surfaces,<br>

shown in Figure 5, on the axis VII-VII,<br>
Figure 8 is a side view of two half-washers placed<br>
side-by-side.<br>
According to Figure 1, the splice protecting device consists of two half-shells 1, l' which are totally identical, comprising a substantially semi-cylindrical median part 2 delimited on either side by longitudinal bearing surfaces 3, 4.<br>
The two half-shells 1, 1' are pressed against each other by their bearing surfaces 3, 4, so that the semi-cylindrical median parts 2 define between them, on the inside, an accommodation channel 10 for the cables level with the splices (not shown) (Figure 2).<br>
According to Figures 2 and 3, a first bearing surface 3 has a groove 5 which extends over substantially its entire length.  The second bearing surface 4, meanwhile, is equipped with a rib 6 corresponding to the groove 5 and also extending over substantially its entire length.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, when the two half-shells 1, 1' are positioned facing each other around the cables level with the splices, the groove 5 in one of the half-shells cooperates with the rib 6 in the other half-shell 1' and vice versa.<br>
According to Figure 4, the groove 5 in each half-shell is filled with a sealing material A, particularly a mastic which is introduced by pouring.<br>
The insertion of a rib 6 in the mass of material A, in the position shown in Figure 4, results in displacement and deformation of this mass A, thus ensuring a longitudinal seal between the two half-shells 1, 1' around the splice (not shown).<br>
Furthermore, as in Figure 1, the bearing surfaces 3, 4 of the half-shells 1, l1 are provided along their edges with ratchet connecting means 20, 21, alternately<br><br>
male and female, which cooperate in pairs to lock the half-sheila l, l' around the cables simply by pressure.<br>
The half-shells are also provided on their bearing surfaces 3, 4 with attachment rings 22 enabling them to be fixed to a building exterior, in particular.<br>
According to Figure 2, the half-shells 1, 1' are provided, on their inside level with their respective ends, with four regularly spaced transverse mouldings 8, 9, namely two inner mouldings 81 9: and two outer mouldings 82, 92; the function of these mouldings is to cooperate with the hollow sealing washers 11 shown in Figures 5 to 8 to ensure lateral tightness of the device in a manner which will be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
According to Figure 8, each sealing washer 11 is made up of a combination of two identical half-washers 12, 13 arranged head-to-tail and fixed to one another by ratchet means 14, 14' .<br>
In a manner which is not shown in the drawings, the entire inner space of the half-washers 12, 13 is filled with a polymer sealant in the form of a substantially incompressible gel having high elongation characteristics.<br>
According to Figures 5 to 8, each sealing half-washer 12, 13 consists of a circular plate 15 the inner surface of which is surrounded by a peripheral flange 16 and which is extended by flexible leaves 24 (six, in the embodiment shown in the drawings) which are independent of one another; these leaves 24 extend radially from the peripheral flange 16 so as to sub-divide the inner space of the half-washers 12, 13 into six radial compartments  sub of equal size.<br>
The flange is furthermore sub-divided into a main annular part 17 integral with the inner surface of the plate 15 and an auxiliary annular part 18 separated from the main annular part 17 by a peripheral annular recess 19 of specified width, and fixed thereto by the flexible<br><br>
leaves 24 which have a cut-out 25 level with this recess (Figure 7).<br>
According to Figure 5 the circular plate 15 is drilled with median openings 23 through which cables which are to be connected (not shown) can pass.  These openings 23 are made up of pennants in a star-shaped configuration and are arranged as a central opening surrounded by six peripheral openings which are situated respectively in one of the compartments defined by the radial leaves 24.  Of course, this configuration by no means restricts the invention.<br>
In view of the foregoing, each half-washer 12, 13 is in the form of a gel-filled cylinder one of the lateral surfaces of which, immediately adjacent the peripheral flange 16, consists of gel; this latter is also flush on the outside with the median openings 23 in the circular plate 15 and with the peripheral recess 19.<br>
Moreover, and as shown in Figure 8, the width e of the auxiliary annular part 18 of the flange 16 is equal to half the width E of the main annular part 17 thereof; consequently, after the two half-washers 12, 13 have been fitted together by means of the ratchet members 14, 14', a sealing washer 11 is obtained having three annular parts of equal size separated by two gel-filled peripheral annular recesses 19.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 8, after the two half-shells 1, 1' have been closed, these recesses 19 cooperate with the inner semi-circular transverse mouldings 81, 9. to ensure transverse tightness of the device.<br>
This cooperation may be broadly likened to the cooperation of the ribs 6 with the mastic A which fills the grooves 5 shown in Figure 4: in fact, the inner transverse moulding 8, 9l  penetrate into the gel filling the peripheral annular recesses 19 of the washers ll, causing displacement and deformation of this gel.<br>
As for the outer transverse moulding 8Z, 9:, these<br><br>
