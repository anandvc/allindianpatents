The present invention relates to antibodies against insulin-like growth factor I<br>
receptor (IGF-IR), methods for their production, pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing said antibodies, and uses thereof.	<br>
Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR, EC 2.7.112, CD 221 antigen) belongs to the family of transmembrane protein tyrosine kinases (LeRoith, D., et al, Endocrin. Rev. 16 (1995) 143-163; and Adams, T.E., et al.. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 57<br>
(2000)	1050-1093). IGF-IR binds IGF-I with high affinity and initiates the<br>
physiological response to this ligand in vivo. IGF-IR also binds to IGF-II, however<br>
with slightly lower affinity. IGF-IR overexpression promotes the neoplastic<br>
transformation of cells and there exists evidence that IGF-IR is involved in<br>
malignant transformation of cells and is therefore a useful target for the<br>
development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer (Adams, T.E., et al.,<br>
Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 57 (2000) 1050-1093).<br>
Antibodies against IGF-IR are well-known in the state of the art and investigated for their antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo (Benini, S., et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 7<br>

252). Antibodies against IGF-IR are also described in a lot of further publications, e.g., Arteaga, C.L., et al.. Breast Cancer Res. Treatment 22 (1992) 101-106; and Hailey, J., et al, Mol. Cancer Ther. 1 (2002) 1349-1353.<br>
In particular, the monoclonal antibody against IGF-IR called aIR3i-s widely used in the investigation of studying IGF-IR mediated processes and IGF-I mediated diseases such as cancer. Alpha-IR-3 was described by Kull, F.C., J. Biol. Chem. 258 (1983) 6561-6566. In the meantime, about a hundred publications have been published dealing with the investigation and therapeutic use of aIR3 in regard to its antitumor effect, alone and together with cytostatic agents such as doxorubicin and vincristine. aIR3 is a murine monoclonal antibody which is known to inhibit IGF-I binding to IGF receptor but not IGF-II binding to IGF-IR. aIR3 stimulates at high concentrations tumor cell proliferation and IGF-IR phosphorylation (Bergmann, U., et al.. Cancer Res. 55 (1995) 2007-2011; Kato, H., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268 (1993) 2655-2661). There exist other antibodies (e.g., 1H7, Li, S.L., et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 49 (2000) 243-252) which inhibit IGF-II binding to IGF-IR more potently than IGF-I binding. A summary of the state of the art of antibodies and their properties and characteristics is described by Adams, T.E., et al., Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 57 (2000) 1050-1093.<br>
Most of the antibodies described in the state of the art are of mouse origin. Such antibodies are, as is well known in the state of the art, not useful for the therapy of human patients without further alterations like chimerization or humanization. Based on these drawbacks, human antibodies are clearly preferred as therapeutic agents in the treatment of human patients. Human antibodies are well-known in the state of the art (van Dijk, M.A., and van de Winkel, J.G., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 5 (2001) 368-374). Based on such technology, human antibodies against a great variety of targets can be produced. Examples of human antibodies against IGF-IR are described in WO 02/053596, WO2004071529, WO2005016967 WO2006008639, US20050249730, US20050084906, WO2005058967, WO2006013472, US20030165502, WO2005082415, WO2005016970, WO03106621, WO04083248, WO2003100008, WO2004087756, WO2005005635 and WO2005094376.<br>
However, there is still a need for antibodies against IGF-IR with convincing benefits for patients in need of antitumor therapy. The relevant benefit for the patient is, in simple terms, reduction in tumor growth and a significant prolongation of time to progression caused by the treatment with the antitumorigenic agent.<br><br><br><br>
Routier, F.H. et al., Glycoconjugate J. 14 (1997) 201-207 report the glycosylation pattern of a humanized IgGl antibody expressed in CHO-DUKX cells. This antibody shows a molar ratio of Fuc: Man of 0.8 ; 3.0, which refers to a fucosylation ratio of 80%. Niwa, R. et al., J. Immunol. Methods 306 (2005) 151-160 report for anti-CD20 IgGl and IgG3 antibodies recombinatly produced in CHO DG44 fucosylation of 90% resp. 91%. Mimura, Y. et al., J. Immunol. Methods 247 (2001) 205-216 report that butyrate increases production of human chimeric IgG in CHO-Kl cells whilst maintaining function and glycoform profile. The oligosaccharide profiles show a considerable content of afucosylated glycan structures. Raju, T.S., BioProcess International 1 (2003) 44-53 report the impact of glycosylation variation by expression systems on the biological activity of therapeutic immunoglobulins and the nomenclature. Ma, S. et al.. Anal. Chem. 71 (1999) 5185-5192 report the carbohydrate analysis of rituximab. Rituximab shows 9-10% fucosylation (Niwa, R. et al., J. Immunol. Methods 306 (2005) 151-160). Fujii, S., J. Biol. Chem 265 (1990) 6009-6018 report that bovine IgG includes about 11% afucosylated IgG. Mizuochi, T., J. Immunol. 129 (1982) 2016-2020 report that human IgG is about 14% afucosylated. Bergwerff, A.A., Glycoconjugate J. 12 (1995) 318-330 report that antibodies produced in mouse SP2/0 contains N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) oligosaccharides in large amounts.

Davies, J., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 74 (2001) 288-294 report that expression of aritrbodies with altered glycoforms leads to an increase of ADCC. Sheeley, D.M., et al.. Anal. Biochem. 247 (1997) 102-110 compare antibody glycosylation in different expression systems. Shields, R.L., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 26733-26740 report that lack of fucose on human IgGl Fc improves FcyRIII binding and ADCC.

The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising such antibodies in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition may be included in an article of manufacture or kit.<br>
The invention further comprises a method for the production of a recombinant human antibody according to the invention, characterized by expressing a nucleic acid encoding an antibody binding to IGF-IR in a CHO host cell, which completely fucosylates said antibody and recovering said antibody from said cell. The invention further comprises the antibody obtainable by such a recombinant method.<br>
The term "antibody" encompasses the various forms of antibodies including but not being limited to whole antibodies, antibody fragments, human antibodies, humanized antibodies and genetically engineered antibodies as long as the characteristic properties according to the invention are retained.<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally at least the antigen binding portion or the variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include diabodies, single-chain antibody molecules, immunotoxins, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.<br>
The terms "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of a single amino acid composition. Accordingly, the term "human monoclonal antibody" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences.<br>
The term "chimeric antibody" refers to a monoclonal antibody comprising a variable region, i.e., binding region, from one source or species "and at least a portion of a constant region derived from a different source or species, usually prepared by recombinant DNA techniques. Chimeric antibodies comprising a murine variable region and a human constant region are especially preferred. Such murine/human chimeric antibodies are the product of expressed immunoglobulin<br><br>
genes comprising DNA segments encoding murine immunoglobulin variable regions and DNA segments encoding human immunoglobulin constant regions. Other forms of "chimeric antibodies" encompassed by the present invention are those in which the class or subclass has been modified or changed from that of the original antibody. Such "chimeric" antibodies are also referred to as "class-switched antibodies." Methods for producing chimeric antibodies involve conventional recombinant DNA and gene transfection techniques now well known in the art. See, e.g., Morrison, S.L., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 81 (1984) 6851-6855; US Patent Nos. 5,202,238 and 5,204,244.<br>
The term "humanized antibody" refers to antibodies in which the framework or "complementarity determining regions" (CDR) have been modified to comprise the CDR of an immunoglobulin of different specificity as compared to that of the parent immunoglobulin. In a preferred embodiment, a murine CDR is grafted into the framework region of a human antibody to prepare the "humanized antibody." See, e.g., Riechmann, L., et al., Nature 332 (1988) 323-327; and Neuberger, M.S., et al.. Nature 314 (1985) 268-270. Particularly preferred CDRs correspond to those representing sequences recognizing the antigens noted above for chimeric and bifunctional antibodies.<br>
The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The variable heavy chain is preferably derived from germline sequence DP-50 (GenBank L06618) and the variable light chain is preferably derived from germline sequence L6 (GenBank X01668) or the variable heavy chain is preferably derived DP-61 (GenBank M99682) and the variable light chain is derived from germline sequence LI 5 (GenBank KOI323). The constant regions of the antibody are constant regions of human IgGl type. Such regions can be allotypic and are described by, e.g., Johnson, G., and Wu, T.T., Nucleic Acids Res. 28 (2000) 214-218 and the databases referenced therein.<br>
The term "recombinant human antibody", refers to antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences in a rearranged form. The recombinant human antibodies according to the invention have been subjected to in vivo somatic hypermutation. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.<br>

As used herein, " binding" refers to antibody binding to IGF-IR with an affinity of about 10"' to 10" M (KD), preferably of about lO'" to 10" M.<br>
The term "nucleic acid molecule", as used herein, is intended to include DNA molecules and RNA molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.<br>
Human constant domains having of IgGl or IgG3 type are described in detail by Kabat, E.A. et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed.. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (j991), and by BrUggemann, M., et al., J. Exp. Med. 166 (1987) 1351-1361; Love, T.W., et al., Methods Enzymol. 178 (1989) 515-527. Examples are shown in SEQ ID N0S:5 to 8. Other useful and preferred constant domains are the constant domains of the antibodies obtainable from the hybridoma cell lines deposited with DSMZ for this invention.<br>
Constant domains of IgGl or IgG3 type are glycosylated at Asn297. "Asn 297" according to the invention means amino acid asparagine located at about position 297 in the Fc region; based on minor sequence variations of antibodies, Asn297 can also be located some amino acids (usually not more than +3 amino acids) upstream or downstream. For example, in one antibody according to the invention "Asn297" is located at amino acid position 298.<br>
Glycosylation of human IgGl or IgG3 occurs at Asn297 as core fucosylated biannteimary complex oligosaccharide glycosylation terminated with up to 2 Gal residues. These structures are designated as GO, Gl (al,6 or al,3) or G2 glycan residues, depending from the amount of terminal Gal residues (Raju, T.S., BioProcess Int. 1 (2003) 44-53). CHO type glycosylation of antibody Fc parts is e.g. described by Routier, F.H., Glycoconjugate J. 14 (1997) 201-207.<br>
The "variable region" (variable region of a light chain (VL), variable region of a heavy chain (VH)) as used herein denotes each of the pair of light and heavy chains which is involved directly in binding the antibody to the antigen. The domains of variable human light and heavy chains have the same general structure and each domain comprises four framework (FR) regions whose sequences are widely conserved, connected by three "hypervariable regions" (or complementarity determining regions, CDRs). The framework regions adopt a j3-sheet"'c6nformation and the CDRs may form loops connecting the f3-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held in their three-dimensional structure by the framework regions and form together with the CDRs from the other chain the antigen binding site. The<br>
11<br><br>
antibody heavy and light chain CDR3 regions play a particularly important role in the binding specificity/affinity of the antibodies according to the invention and therefore provide a further object of the invention.<br>
The terms "hypervariable region" or "antigen-binding portion of an antibody" when used herein refer to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from the "complementarity determining regions" or "CDRs". "Framework" or "FR" regions are those variable domain regions other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Therefore, the light and heavy chains of an antibody comprise from N- to C-terminus the domains FRl, CDRl, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDRS, and FR4. Especially, CDRS of the heavy chain is the region which contributes most to antigen binding. CDR and FR regions are determined according to the standard definition of Kabat, E.A. et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed., Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable loop".<br>
The term "binding to IGF-IR" as used herein means the binding of the antibody to IGF-IR in an in vitro assay, preferably in a binding assay in which the antibody is bound to a surface and binding of IGF-IR is measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Binding means a binding affinity (KD) of 10" M or less, preferably 10"' to 10" M.<br>
Binding to IGF-IR can be investigated by a BIAcore assay (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The affinity of the binding is defined by the terms ka (rate constant for the association of the antibody from the antibody/antigen complex), kd (dissociation constant), and KD (kd/ka). The antibodies according to the invention show a KD of 10'° M or less.<br>
The binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR is also inhibited by the antibodies according to the invention. The inhibition is measured as IC50 in an assay for binding of IGF-I/IGF-II to IGF-IR on tumor cells. Such an assay is described in Example 7. In such an assay, the amount of radiolabeled IGF-I or IGF-II or IGF-IR binding fragments thereof bound to the IGF-IR provided at the surface of said tumor cells (e.g. HT29) is measured without and with increasing concentrations of the antibody. The IC50 values of the antibodies according to the invention for the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR are no more than 2 nM and the ratio of the IC50 values for binding of IGF-I/IGF-II to IGF-IR is about 1:3 to 3:1. IC50 values are measured as average or median values of at least three independent measurements. Single IC50 values may be out of the scope.<br>
12<br><br>
The term "inhibiting the binding of IGF-I and IGF-II to IGF-IR" as used herein refers to inhibiting the binding of l'"'-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II to IGF-IR presented on the surface of HT29 (ATCC HTB-38) tumor cells in an in vitro assay. Inhibiting means an IC50 value of 2 nM or lower.<br>
The term "IGF-IR expressing cells" refers to such cells which are overexpressing<br>
IGF-I receptor to about at least 20,000 receptors/cell. Such cells are, for example,<br>
tumor cell lines such as NCI H322M or HT29, or a cell line (e.g. 3T3 ATCC<br>
CRL1658) overexpressing IGF-IR after transfection with an expression vector for<br>
IGF-IR. The amount of receptors per cell is measured according to Lammers, R., et<br>
al., EMBO J. 8 (1989) 1369-1375.	, . .<br>
The term "inhibiting of IGF-IR phosphorylation" refers to a cellular phosphorylation assay using 3T3 cells providing 400,000 to 600,000 molecules IGF-IR per cell in a medium containing 0.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) when compared to such an assay without said antibody. Phosphorylation is detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Such an assay is described in Example 11. Heat inactivation of FCS is performed by short term heating to 56° C for inactivation of the complement system.<br>
The term "inhibiting of PKB phosphorylation" refers to a cellular phosphorylation assay using 3T3 cells providing 400,000 to 600,000 molecules IGF-IR per cell in a medium containing 0.5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) when compared to such an assay without said antibody. Phosphorylation is detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for PKB phosphoylated at serine 473 of PKB (Akt 1, Swiss Prot Ace. No. P31749). Such an assay is described in Example 11.<br>
The term "antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)" refers to lysis of human tumor target cells by an antibody according to the invention in the presence of effector cells. ADCC is measured preferably by the treatment of a preparation of IGF-IR expressing cells with an antibody according to the invention in the presence of effector cells such as freshly isolated PBMC or purified effector cells from buffy coats, like monocytes or NK cells.<br>
The term "complete inhibition of IGF-I mediated signal transduction" refers to the inhibition of IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of IGF-IR. For such an assay, IGF-IR expressing cells, preferably H322M cells, are stimulated with IGF-I and treated with an antibody according to the invention (an antibody concentration of 5 nM or higher is useful). Subsequently, an SDS PAGE is performed and phosphorylation<br>
13<br><br>
of IGF-IR is measured by Western blotting analysis with an antibody specific for phosphorylated tyrosine. Complete inhibition of the signal transduction is found if on the Western blot visibly no band can be detected which refers to phosphorylated IGF-IR.<br>
The antibodies according to the invention show preferably a binding to the same epitope of IGF-IR as antibody 18 or are inhibited in binding to IGF-IR due to steric hindrance of binding by antibody 18. Binding inhibition can be detected by an SPR assay using immobilized antibody 18 and IGF-IR at a concentration of 20-50 nM and the antibody to be detected at a concentration of 100 nM. A signal reduction of 50% or more shows that the antibody competes with antibody 18. Such an assay can be performed in the same manner by using antibody 22 as an immobilized antibody.<br>
The term "epitope" means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents.<br>
The antibodies according to the invention inhibit IGF-IR phosphorylation of tyrosine and preferably also PKB phosphorylation of tyrosine to a similar extent.<br>
The antibodies according to the invention preferably downregulate the IGF-IR protein level in tumor cells and in tumors , e.g. xenograft tumors.<br>
The antibodies according to the invention inhibit preferably the three-dimensional growth of tumor cells in a colony formation assay as well as proliferation of IGF-IR expressing cells (e.g. NIH 3T3 cells).<br>
The antibodies according to the invention preferably do not inhibit binding of insulin to insulin receptor in a binding competition assay on insulin receptor overexpressing 3T3 cells using the antibody in a concentration of 200 nmol/1.<br>
The antibodies according to the invention are produced by recombinant means in a CHO cell which completely fucosylate the antibody. For the protein expression, nucleic acids encoding light and heavy chains or fragments thereof are inserted into expression vectors by standard methods. Expression is performed in such CHO cells, and the antibody is recovered from the cells (supernatant or cells after lysis).<br>
14<br><br>
A useful CHO host cell can be produced by a method comprising cultivating a CHO cell, transfected with nucleic acid encoding an antibody according to the invention, under DHFR selection pressure, picking single clones expanding the clones and selecting a clone producing an antibody with the glycosylation pattern according to the invention. Preferably cultivation is performed for at least two, preferably at least three weeks. The CHO cell is preferably a DG44 cell.<br>
The term "CHO cell" encompasses the various forms of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells based on two deleted dhfr alleles (dihydrofolate reductase deficient (dhfr')). Such dhfr' cells and methods for their generation are described e.g. in Urlaub, G. et al., Cell 33 (1983) 405-412; Chasin, L. et al., Som. Cell Molec. Genet. 12 (1986) 555-556; Kolkekar, A.S. et al.. Biochemistry 36 (1997) 10901-10909. Preferably the cell is a DG44 cell line. Such CHO dhfr:.cells can be produced using gamma rays to eliminate the entire dhfr locus. In non-mutated, wild-type cells, dhfr is an essential enzyme for de novo synthesis of glycine, purines, and thymidylate. This allows the dhfr gene encoded on plasmids to be used as a dominant selectable marker and a gene amplifier for the expression of proteins in dhfr" deficient cell lines. The dhfr" mutation in DG44 cells is stable and irreversible. CHO cells successfully co-transfected with expression vector(s) for an antibody of human IgGl or IgG3 type and the DHFR gene will possess the dhfr+ phenotype and can readily be selected by culturing the colonies on media devoid of thymidine and hypoxanthine and optionally containing methotrexate (MTX) for amplification.<br>
DG44 cells are well known in the state of the art and e. g. commercial available as cell lines e.g. from Invitrogen Corp.(USA). DG44 cells can grow, adherent, in suspension and/or in serum-free medium. As used herein, the expressions "cell," "cell line," and "cell culture" are used interchangeably and all such designations of CHO dhfr" cell lines (two deleted dhfr alleles) include progeny. Thus, the words "transformants" and "transformed cells" include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Variant progeny that have the glycosylation properties according to the invention as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included.<br>
Preferably the CHO dhfr" cell line is co-amplified with at least DHFR as one selectable marker gene. For example a mammalian expression vector containing the selectable marker(s) and the antibody gene are co-transfected into recipient<br><br>
CHO cells. The resulting colonies may be selected and colonies" eAibiting the expected phenotype are capable of expressing the antibody. Additional selectable markers are or may not be of a dominant nature. Examples of additional selectable markers for use co-transfection include adenosine deaminase (Kaufman, R.J., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83 (1986) 3136-3140) asparagine synthetase (Cartier, M., et al., Mol.Cell Biol. 7 (1987) 1623-1628), E. coli trpB gene and Salmonella hisD gene (Hartman, S.C, and Mulligan, R.C., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988) 8047-8051), M2 mouse ribonucleotide reductase (Thelander, M., and Thelander, L., EMBO J. 8 (1989) 2475-2479), human multidrug resistance gene (Kane, S.E., et al. Gene 84 (1989) 439-446), glutamine synthetase (Bebbington, C.R. et al, DNA Cloning, Vol. Ill, D.M. Glover (ed.), IRL Press, pp. 163-188, 1987), xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt) (Mulligan, R.C., and Berg, P., Science 209 (1980) 1422-1427), hygromycin B (Santerre, R.F., et al., Gene 30 (1984) 147-156), neomycin gene (Southern, P.J., and Berg,' P., J. Mol. Appl.Genet. 1 (1982) 327-341).<br>
The selectable markers may also provide the basis upon which the genes encoding the antibody may be amplified. In co-transfection of a CHO cell line, the vector DNAs are often integrated into the chromosome of the cell at the same locus. Thus, the use of only one of the selectable markers as the basis for amplification normally results in a parallel increase in the copy number of both genes. One particular selectable marker for use in this way is dhfr which enables the desired amplification to be obtained thi'ough the use of increasing concentrations of MTX. A second preferred selectable marker is GS which allows amplification by the addition of methionine sulphoximine (MSX).<br>
The selectable markers are of course under the control of regulatory elements of DNA so as to provide for their expression. In the case of the use of dhfr as a selectable marker, the regulatory elements are preferably of a viral source, such as from DNA tumour viruses. Particularly preferred are the use of an SV40 or adenovirus major late promoter. It is particularly advantageous in this regard to remove the enhancer element from the promoter thus effectively "crippling" it. This modification allows for increased levels of gene amplification at each concentration of methotrexate selection than would otherwise occur if a strong promoter was used. In the case of the use of neomycin as a selectable marker, an example of a suitable promoter is the mouse metallothionein promoter.<br>
The general methods for recombinant production of antibodies are well-known in the state of the art and described, for example, in the review articles of Makrides,<br><br>
S.C, Protein Expr. Purif. 17 (1999) 183-202; Geisse, S., et al., Protein Expr. Purif. 8 (1996) 271-282; Kaufman, R.J., Mol. Biotechnol. 16 (2000) 15i-l&amp;l; Werner, R.G., Drug Res. 48 (1998) 870-880.<br>
The antibodies may be present in whole cells, in the supernant, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form. Purification is performed in order to eliminate other cellular components or other contaminants, e.g. other cellular nucleic acids or proteins, by standard techniques, including alkaline/SDS treatment, CsCl banding, column chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis, and others well known in the art. See Ausubel, F., et al., ed. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York (1987).<br>
The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, enhancers and polyadenylation signals.<br>
Nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies can be suitably separated from a hybridoma culture medium by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. DNA and RNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated from the hybridoma and sequenced using conventional procedures. The hybridoma cells can serve as a source of such DNA and RNA. Once identified and isolated, the DNA may be inserted into expression vectors, which are then transfected into CHO cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in the host cells.<br><br>
The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising the antibody according to the invention conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, or fragments thereof), a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate) or a prodrug of a cytotoxic agent. Agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleuritesfordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes.<br>
Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2=pyridyldithioI) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters; (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediatnine), diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta, E.S., et al, Science 238 (1987) 1098-1104). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO 94/11026.<br>

Examples<br>
Cell lines<br>
The parental cell line used for the generation of a cell line for recombinant IgG expression is a Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell line, CHO-DG44 (Flintoff, W.F. et al., Somat. Cell Genet. 2 (1976) 245-261; Flintoff et al., Moi. Cell. Biol. 2 (1982) 275-285; Urlaub, G. et al., Cell 33 (1983) 405-412; Urlaub, G. et al, Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 12 (1986) 555-566). CHO-DG44 cells have lost both endogenous loci for the enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR).<br>

Determination of antibody mediated effector functions by anti-IGF-IR HuMAbs<br>
In order to determine the capacity of the generated HuMAb antibodies to elicit immune effector mechanisms, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) studies were performed.<br>
To study the effects of the antibodies in ADCC, DU145 prostate cancer cells (1 x 106 in 2 to 4 ml RPMI-FM) expressing IGF-IR were labeled with 1 |al BATDA solution for 25 minutes at 37°C in a cell incubator. Cells were washed four times with 10 ml of RPMI-FM and spun for 10 minutes at 200 xg with brake. Afterwards, cells were adjusted to a concentrations of 1 x 10 cells per ml. 5,000 cells were plated per well in a round bottom plate corresponding to a volume of 50 |il. HuMAb antibodies were added at a final concentration ranging from 25-0.1 ng/ml in a volume of 50 pi cell culture medium. Subsequently, 50 [x\ of effector cells, PBMC freshly isolated from whole blood or purified effector cells from buffycoats, were added at an E:T ratio in the range of 25:1. The plates were centrifuged immediately for 1 minute at 200 xg with brake, and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. After incubation the cells were spun down for 10 minutes at 200 xg and 20 |al of supernatant were transferred to an Optiplate 96-F microtiterplate. 200 |al of Europium solution (at room temperature) were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 minutes on a shaker. Resulting fluorescence was measured in a time-resolved fluorometer using the EU-TDA protocol from Perkin Elmer.<br>
The magnitude of cell lysis by ADCC is expressed as % of the maximum release of TDA from the target cells lysed by detergent corrected for spontaneous release of TDA from the respective target cells. As reference standard of an antibody showing "no ADCC" is used an antibody against KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) or an IgG mixture isolated from about 35.000 donors ("Redimune"). A 75% fucose free antibody against IGF-IR was used as positive control. An antibody according to the invention showed a TDA release which is within 3xSD of the TDA release of the standard antibody (Fig. 1).<br>

Inhibition of IGF-I and IGF-II binding to tumor cells expressing IGF-IR<br>
In order to determine the ability of the antibody of the invention to block binding of the ligands IGF-I and IGF-II to the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), competition experiments with radioactively labeled ligand peptides were performed.<br>
Human tumor cells (HT29, NCI H322M, 0.5 to 1 x IQ-'/ml) were plated in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Cat. No. El5-039) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamin, Ix non-essential amino acids (Gibco, Cat. No. 11140-035), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Cat. No. 11360-039) and 10% heat inactivated FCS (PAA, Cat. No. A15-771). Six bottles in the T175 format were inoculated with 20 ml cells in the respective medium for each experiment and cultivated for two days at 37°C and 5% CO2 to obtain confluent cell monolayers.<br>
To collect individual cells, 2 ml of Ix Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, Cat. No. 25300-054) per T175 flask were added and detachment of cells monitored with a Zeiss Axiovert25 microscope. The cells were collected and medium with 10% FCS as described before was added to a total volume of 50 ml. Cells were reisolated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm (Heraeus sepatech, Omhtfiige 2.0 RS) and resuspended in 50 ml of binding buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgS04, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM D(+)glucose, 15 mM NaAc, 100 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 1% BSA). Cells were counted, reisolated by centrifugation and adjusted with binding buffer to 1 x 10 cells/ml.<br><br>
l'--labeled IGF-I and IGF-II peptides (Amersham, -2000 Ci/mmol, Cat. No. IM172 and IM238), solubilized in 0.1 % CH3COOH, were diluted in binding buffer to a final activity of 4 x 10 counts/(minute x ml). 75 |J! of antibody at the specified concentrations together with 25 fal of prediluted I'"'-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II peptide was added to 200 |ul of cell suspension and incubated for 3,5 h at 4°C. Cells were reisolated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm (Eppendorf, 5415C) and supernatant removed. After washing two times in 1 ml binding buffer, cells were resuspended in 1 ml binding buffer and transferred to scintillation tubes. The amount of radioactive peptide bound to the cell surface receptors was measured on a scintillation counter.<br>
The average IC50 value for antibody 18 is 0.3 nM. No detectable inhibition for IGF-II binding could be observed.<br>
Example 7<br>
Antibody competition assay for IGF-IR binding<br>
For an epitope mapping of anti-IGF-IR monoclonal antibodies a similar format as for affinity measurement (Example 5) was selected, but IGF-IR was pre-incubated for at least 0.5 hours at RT with the antibody in solution. This mixture was injected and IGF-IR binding (or inhibition) was detected. This assay allows measuring the reciprocal inhibitory activity of monoclonal antibodies for IGF-IR binding. It was found that the antibodies of the invention compete for binding to IGF-IR witii aIR3, an antibody which is known to bind to aa 217-274 (Gustafson, T.A., and Rutter, W.J., J. Biol. Chem. 265 (1990) 18663-18667).<br>
Example 8<br>
Inhibition of IGF-I mediated phosphorylation of IGF-IR and Akt/PKB<br>
In order to determine the ability of the antibody of the invention to inhibit activation and phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), competition experiments were performed with IGF-I peptide and subsequent Western blotting analysis with antibodies specific for phosphorylated tyrosine.<br>
Human tumor cells (HT29, NCI H322M, 5 x 10/ml) were plated in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Cat. No. E15-039) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamin, Ix non¬essential aminoacids (Gibco, Cat. No. 11140-035), 1 mM sodium pypjyate (Gibco, Cat. No. 11360-039) and 0.5% heat inactivated FCS (PAA, Cat. No. Al 5-771). For determination of IC50 values, 12 well plates were inoculated with 1 ml cells in<br><br>
the respective medium for each experiment and cultivated for two days at 37°C and 5% CO2.<br>
After 48 hours of cultivation with low serum medium, the medium was carefully removed and replaced by different concentrations of antibody diluted in the respective medium. After 5 minutes incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2IGF-I peptide was added at a final concentration of 2 nM and cells were again incubated for 10 minutes under the conditions mentioned above. The medium was carefully removed by aspiration and 100 |j] of cold lysis buffer was added per well (50mM Hepes pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, ImM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton®-X100, lOOmM NaF, 10 mM Na4P207, Complete® protease inhibitor). The cells were detached using a cell scraper (Corning, Cat. No. 3010) and well contents transferred to Eppendorf reaction tubes. Cell fragments were removed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13000 rpm and 4°C and half of the supernatant was added to 2x Laemmli sample buffer in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. For immunoprecipitation of IGF-IR, the remaining supernatant of cell lysates underwent a clearifying spin (10 minutes at 13000 rpm and 4°C) right before 1 pi of an polyclonal antibody against IGF-IRB (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or a murine monoclonal antibody (IgGl) which recognizes an epitope within amino acids 440-586 of the extracellular domain (a-chain) of the human IGF Type 1 Receptor was added (mAb 24-55, GroPep). After 2 hours incubation at 4°C in a rotating Eppendorf reaction tube, 25 pi Protein G Sepharose® beads (Amersham Biosciences, Cat. No. 17-0618-01) were added followed by another incubation step of 1 haur at 4°C. The beads with bound antibody-protein-complexes were isolated by centrifugation (1 minute at 2000 rpm and 4°C) and washed three times with wash buffer (lysis buffer with only 0.1% Triton®-X100). After boiling the beads in Laemmli sample buffer, cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN® BA 85, Schleicher&amp;Schuell) by semi-dry Western blotting.<br>
A phosphotyrosine specific antibody (Upstate, clone 4G10, Cat. No. 05-321) was used to determine phosphorylation status of immunopurified IGF-IR. For the detection of phosphorylated Akt/PKB an antibody with specificity for phosphorylated Ser473 (Cell Signalling, Cat. No. 9271) was applied.<br><br>

Induction of antibody mediated downregulation of IGF-IR in-vitro<br>
In order to detect effects of the antibody of the invention on the amount of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in tumor cells, time-course experiments and subsequent western-blotting analysis with IGF-IR specific antibodies were performed.<br>
Human tumor cells (HT29, 5x10 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Cat. No. E15-039) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamin, Ix non-essential aminoacids (Gibco, Cat. No. 11140-035), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Cat. No. 11360-039) and 10% heat inactivated FCS (PAA, Cat. No. Al 5-771). For each incubation period one 12 well plate was inoculated with 1 ml cells in the respective medium for each experiment and cultivated for 24 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2.<br>
The medium was carefully removed and replaced by different concentrations of antibody diluted in the respective medium. In two control wells, medium was replaced by either medium without antibody or medium with a control antibody (AB-1, Oncogene, Cat. No. GRl 1). Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 and individual plates were taken out for further processing after 15 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours.<br>
The medium was carefully removed by aspiration and 100 [il of cold lysis buffer was added per well (50mM Hepes pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, ImM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton®-X100, lOOmM NaF, 10 mM Na4P207, Complete® protease inhibitor). The cells were detached using a cell scraper (Corning, Cat; No. 3010) and well contents transferred to Eppendorf reaction tubes. Cell fragments were removed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13000 rpm and 4°C and the supernatant was added to 2x Laemmli sample buffer in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN® BA 85, Schleicher&amp;Schuell, Cat. No. 10 401196) by semi-dry western-blotting.<br>
An antibody specific for IGF-IR (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Cat. No. sc-713) was used to determine protein levels of IGF-IR.<br>
Downregulation of IGF-IR induced by the antibody of the invention after less than 24 hours after addition of the antibody was observed.<br><br>

Inhibition of insulin binding to 3T3-cells expressing human insulin receptor<br>
In order to determine whether the antibody of the invention also blocks binding of insulin to the insulin receptor (IR), competition experiments were performed with a radioactively labeled ligand peptide.<br>
3T3 cells (1 X 10/ml) expressing recombinantly high numbers (&gt;10) human IR were plated in MEM Dulbecco medium (DMEM) with high glucose (PAA, Cat. No. El5-009) supplemented with 2mM L-Glutamin (Gibco, Cat. No. 25030-024) and 10% heat inactivated PCS (PAA, Cat. No. A15-771). Six bottles in the T175 format were inoculated with 20 ml cells in the respective medium for each experiment and cultivated for two days at 37°C and 5% CO2 to obtain confluent cell monolayers.<br>
To collect individual cells, 2 ml of Ix Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, Cat. No. 25300-054) per T175 flask were added and detachment of cells monitored with a microscope. The cells were collected and medium with 10% PCS as described before was added to a total volume of 50 ml. Cells were reisolated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm and resuspended in 50 ml of binding buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgS04, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM D(+)glucose, 15 mM NaAc, 100 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 1% BSA). Cells were counted, reisolated by centrifugation and adjusted with binding buffer to 1 x 10 cells/ml.<br>
I'-labeled insulin peptide (Amersham, Cat. No. IM166, -2000 Ci/mmol), solubilized in 0.1 % CH3COOH, were diluted in binding buffer to a final activity of 4*10 counts/(minute*ml). 75 pi of antibody together widi 25 |il of prediluted l'-labeled insulin peptide was added to 200 |il of cell suspension (final antibody concentration 200 nM) and incubated for 3,5 h at 4°C. Cells were reisolated by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm and supernatant was removed. After washing two times in 1 ml binding buffer, cells were resuspended in 1 ml binding buffer and transferred to scintillation tubes. The amount of radioactive peptide bound to the cell surface receptors was measured on a scintillation counter.<br>
The results demonstrate that the antibody of the invention does not interfere with binding of insulin ligand to the insulin receptor.<br><br>
No stimulation of IGF-IR and Akt/PKB phosphorylation<br>
In order to exclude IGF-IR stimulating activities of the antibody of the invention, phosphorylation of IGF-IR was determined in the absence of IGF-I ligand but in the presence of the antibody of the invention and a reference antibody (aIR3, Oncogene, Germany). This was performed by a western-blotting analysis with phosphorylation-state specific antibodies. 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) transfected with IGF-IR (5*10'cells/ml, Pietrzkowski, Z., et al.. Cell Growth Differ. 4 (1992) 199-205) were plated in MEM Dulbecco medium (DMEM) with high glucose (PAA, CatNo. El5-009) supplemented with 2mM L-Glutamin (Gibco, CatNo. 25030-024) and 0.5% heat inactivated FCS (PAA, CatNo. A15-771) or human tumor cells (HT29, NCI H322M, 5*10'*/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, CatNo. E15-039) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamin, Ix non-essential aminoacids (Gibco, CatNo. 11140-035), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, CatNo. 11360-039) and 0.5% heat inactivated FCS (PAA, CatNo. Al5-771). For determination of IC50 values, 12 well plates were inoculated with 1 ml cells in the respective medium for each experiment and cultivated for two days at 37°C and 5% CO2.<br>
After 48 hours of cultivation with low serum medium, the medium was carefully removed and replaced by different concentrations of antibody diluted in the respective medium. Cells were incubated for 15 minutes under the conditions mentioned above. The medium was carefully removed by aspiration and 100 pi of cold lysis buffer was added per well (50mM Hepes pH 7.2, 150 mMNaCl, ImM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton-XlOO, lOOmM NaF, 10 mM Na4P207, Complete' protease inhibitor). The cells were detached using a cell scraper (Corning, CatNo. 3010) and well contents transferred to Eppendorf reaction tubes. Cell fragments were removed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13000 rpm and 4°C (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415R) and half of the supernatant was added to 2x Laemrali sample buffer in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. For immunoprecipitation of IGF-IR, the remaining supernatant of cell lysates underwent a clearifying spin (10 minutes at 13000 rpm and 4°C) right before 1 |al of an antibody against IGF-IR was added (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CatNo. sc-713 or mAb 24-55, GroPep, CatNo. MADl). After 2 hours incubation at 4°C in a rotating Eppendorf reaction tube, 25 \il Protein G Sepharose" beads (Amersham Biosciences, CatNo. 17-0618-01) were added followed by another incubation step of 1 hour at 4°C. The beads with bound antibody-protein-complexes were isolated by centrifugation (1 minute at 2000 rpm and 4°C) and washed three times with wash buffer (lysis buffer wkh only 0.1% Triton-XlOO). After boiling the beads in Laemmli sample buffer, cellular proteins<br><br>
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN BA 85, Schleicher&amp;Schuell, CatNo. 10 401196) by semi-dry western-blotting.<br>
A phosphotyrosin specific antibody (Upstate, clone 4G10, CatNo. 05-321, recognizing tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins) was used to determine phosphorylation status of immunopurified IGF-IR. For the detection of phosphorylated Akt/PKB an antibody against Aktl with specificity for phosphorylated Ser473 (Cell Signalling, CatNo. 9271) was applied.<br>
It was observed that the Akt/PKB kinase downstream in the signalling pathway of IGF-IR was significantly activated by the reference antibody at concentrations higher than 5 nM but not by the antibody of the invention at concentrations up to 10.000 nM.<br>
Example 12<br>
Induction of receptor down-regulation in H322M xenograft models<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice and treated once with different concentrations of the antibody of the invention. 24 hours after treatment the tumors were extracted and homogenized under liquid nitrogen. Cold lysis buffer was added (50mM Hepes pH 7.2, 150mMNaCl, ImMEGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton-XlOO, lOOmMNaF, 1 mM Na3V04, 10 mM Na4P207, Complete™ protease inhibitor, ImM PMSF) in a buffer-volume to tumor-weight ratio of 3:1 and thoroughly mixed with the thawing tumor homogenate. After solubilizing the tissue for 15 minutes on ice, insoluble fragments were removed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 13000 rpm and 4°C (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415R). The protein concentration of the-samples was determined with the Micro BCA' Reagents (Pierce) and lysis buffer was added to adjust equal concentrations. Part of the supernatant was added to 2x Laemmli sample buffer in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN BA 85, Schleicher&amp;Schuell, CatNo. 10 401196) by semi-dry western-blotting. An IGF-IR specific antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, CatNo. sc-713) was used to to detect IGF-IR.<br>
Upon treatment with the antibody of the invention, a concentration dependent decrease of IGF-IR levels with an estimated EC50 at 0.6 mg/kg was observed.<br>

Growth inhibition of H322M tumors<br>
The effects of antibody 18 in vivo was investigated by inducing tumors in athymic nude mice according to established methods. Human H322M NSCLC cells were coinjected together with Matrigel subcutaneously into 6-7 week-old athymic nu mice (nu/nu). For that purpose, 5 x 10 H322M cells were concentrated in 100 culture medium and mixed with 100 ual Matrigel. 200|il of this mixture were injected into the right flanks of the mice. Tumor volume was calculated by measuring tumor diameters with Vernier calipers twice a week according to the formula first published by Geran et al. ("Protocols for screening chemical agents and natural products against animal tumors and other biological systems", Cancer Chemother. Rep. 11.301, 1972) where tumor volume [mg] = (length x (width)"). Antibody was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 10ml/ kg. Treatment was started with doubled doses of the antibody administered in doubled volumes. Tumors were induced in nude mice as described above. After tumors had grown to an average volume of 160 mg, mice were treated intraperitoneally six times once a week with 6, 0.6 and 0.06 mg/ kg of antibody as consecutive doses starting with 12, 1.2 and 0.12 mg/ kg as loading dose given once on the first day of treatment. The experiment demonstrates that blocking of the IGF-IR axis by rhu anti-IGF-IR mAb 18 results in antitumoral efficacy when administered as a single agent at 6 and 0.6 mg/kg. In contrast, 0.06 mg/kg had no effect on tumor growth.<br>
In addition antibody 18 was tested in combination with gemcitabine in the same model. Tumors were induced as described above and treatment was initiated when tumors had established and grown to 170mm average in all groups. Antibody was administered once a week i.p. at 6 and 0.6 mg/kg and in combination with 62 mg/ kg of gemcitabine at 0.6 mg. Gemcitabine was administered one cycle i.e. every third day for four times in total. Again, treatment was started by administering doubled doses of the antibody. The experiment demonstrated that treatment with antibody 18 administered once every seven days inhibits tumor growth by itself and enhances the effectiveness of gemcitabine, a known antimetabolic compound.<br>
Example 14<br>
Growth inhibition of 3T3 tumors<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice essentially as described in Example 15 except that murine 3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing the human IGF-IR were used. Mice with established tumors of approximately 180 mg were treated intraperitoneally once weekly for seven times with 18, 6 or 0.6 mg/kg of antibody 18. Again, treatment was started with doubled doses of antibody given as loading dose (36, 12<br><br>
and 1.2 mg/kg). The experiment demonstrates that by treatment with the antibody, tumor growth can be delayed when administered at 18 and 6 mg/kg once weekly.<br><br><br>
