TITLE<br><br>
" AN IMPROVED DEPRESSED AND DEEP PITTED SCAR (DDPS)  OPERATING DEVICE"<br>
APPLICANT<br>
DR BIPINBHASKAR DESHPANDE, of 3 Harihar<br>
Apartments, 8th Lane, Dahanukar Colony,<br>
Kothrud, Pune 411 029, Maharashtra, an<br>
Indian national	<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an uniparlled	depressed and deep pitted scar<br>
(DDPS) operating device.	<br>
The present invention further relates to a novel device to hold uplifted skin to a desired height during the treatment of pitted scars. This invention particularly relates to a new device used with radiosurgery equipment for treatment of depressed and deep pitted scars on skin by radiovaporabrasion technique.<br>
"Depressed and Deep Pitted Scars" (DDPS) on face are a cause for great disturbance in the face value of a person. It can lead to loss of confidence, inadequate performance of a person and great mental distress due to ugly facial appearance. Hence, there is always a great demand to treat such scars on face with cosmetic outcome, whereas, the demand to treat similar lesions on skin of any other part of body is less common.<br>
There are various modalities of treatments available to treat this problem. The commonly available and practiced treatments are: Chemical Peeling, Laser resurfacing, Dermabrasion (mechanical), Punch excision and grafting, Subcision, Microdermabrasion (using Aluminium oxide microcrystals).<br>
All the above treatments have their own advantages, drawbacks and limitations. Hence, there was always a need to have more modalities of treatments and more new devices to be developed to overcome the drawbacks and shortcomings of the already prevalent treatment methods and devices. Considering the need to develop a new device to overcome the drawbacks and shortcomings of the already prevalent treatment methods and equipments, the applicant has invented a novel device used with Radiovaporabrasion for treatment of DDPS on skin especially on the face of a patient. A totally new method using the specially developed Novel Device in combination with a "Radiosurgical equipment" is described hereinafter.<br><br>
Radiosurgery is a branch of surgery where 3.8 and 4 Mega Hertz Radiofrequency waves which are generated with the help of Ellman Surgitron FFPF and DF (Dual Frequency) which are Radiosurgical equipments manufactured by "Ellman International Inc." of New York, USA, (used presently for all "elevated skin lesions". These equipments are used for cutting and coagulation while doing surgery. The surgery is done with the help of RF (Radiofrequency) electrode. The equipments gtenerate 3.8 and 4 Mega Hz. Radiowaves which pass into the tissue through the RF electrode. Tissue resists the passage of Radiowaves. Hence, at the treatment site, impedance to the passage of Radiowaves results in the generation of heat. This heat vaporizes the water molecules in the cells resulting in exploding of the cells in the path of the dissecting RF electrode causing a split in the tissue. Hence, Radiosurgery works on the principle of "Vaporization" of water molecules inside the cells. Radiosurgery is an straumatic method of cutting and coagulating soft tissues because the lateral heat spread to the surrounding tissues is minimum resulting in least lateral tissue damage.<br>
Radiosurgery is used in "Dermatosurgery" (Dermatologic Surgery) for more than 10 years now. In "Dermatosurgery" it is used mostly for the "elevated skin lesions" (lesions above the plans of skin surface). To name a few : moles, warts, skin tags, keratoses etc. Till today, it has not been used for "depressed skin lesions".<br>
At present elevated skin lesions are treated by adopting the following steps by using Ellman Surgitron FFPF and DF equipments and RF electrode.<br>
1)	The skin lesion is held with a forcep and cut at its base with RF electrode, or<br>
2)	The skin lesion is cut layer by layer with the help of fine and light paint brush like strokes till its base,<br><br>
3)      Finally, the skin is stretched between thumb and index finger and the cut edges are feathered out to level with the surroundÂ¬ing skin to give a superior cosmetic result.<br>
The conventional method is suitable only for treating "raised or elevated skin lesions" of face and other parts.<br>
The same method cannot be used for DDPS on skin. In fact there are about 40% of patients in Dermatocosmetology and Dermatosurgery who seek treatment for DDPS on skin.<br>
It has therefore been the endeavour of the applicant to develop an instrument or device which is suitable for the treatment of DDPS on skin with ease and efficiency.<br>
A specially developed device of the present invention is provided with a ring to hold the uplifted "scarred skin" over and above the plane of the skin surface the "Radiovaporabrasion" procedure for DDPS on skin.<br>
Since, "depressed scars" have shrunken skin which is thin and pulled inside, while dealing with such lesions the individual scar has to be lifted above the normal plane of skin surface. In fact there is no device or method to treat "depressed scars on skin" in medical literature by uplifting the skin till date.<br>
The crude way of uplifting with the help of index finger and thumb is always possible. However, this method has the following disadvantages:-<br>
(1)     The fingers being thick it may not give desired lifting of skin on all surfaces.<br><br><br>
(2)	The thickness of fingers varies from doctor to doctor. <br>
(3)	The finger grip is unlikely to remain steady for long timer <br>
(4)	The dermatosurgeon will have to hold the skin with fingers of his free hand instead of his assistant for convenience and for not to obstruct his surgical view.<br>
There is not a single equipment known or as yet developed to hold the uplifted skin to desired height and maintain it in that position till the surgical procedure is over without damaging the skin surrounding the scar lesion in Dermatosurgery.<br>
An object of the present invention is to mitigate the disadvantages experienced in the prior art for the treatment of DDPS on skin.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a novel device to be used with Radiosurgery equipment for the above treatment.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to provide a device having means to hold the uplifted scarred skin over and above the plane of the skin surface during Radiovaporabrasion.<br>
As stated above, there are numerous equipments and devices in Dermatosurgery used for routine and specialized Dermatosurgical and cosmetic surgical procedures. Yet, there is not a single equipment known or developed till date in Dermatosurgery to hold the uplifted skin without damage and maintain it at the desired height till the surgical procedure is over and at the same time having the flexibility to adjust to the scar shape and size.<br><br>
This need as well as the advantage of working on the uplifted skin while treating the  DDPS   on skin using the Radiosurgical equipmet was taken into consideration when developing the    Novel Device of the present,<br>
A^v Â°#Â» â """^ -*â¢"â¢*?"â <br>
invention.	<br>
The newly developed "Novel Device" helps in precisely catching hold of the adjoining skin of the depressed scars without damage. This device can be precisely adjusted to the scar dimensions and shape, helping to hold the uplifted skin at the required height above plane of the skin surface, thus making it easier for any Dermatosurgeon to work with the Radiosurgical equipment for the DDPS on skin.<br>
The present invention provides a novel depressed and deep pitted scar (DDPS) operating device comprising a pair of tongs, one end of which being bent to form C-shaped curve (23), the other non-working end of said tongs being straight and being placed parallel to each other, said straight arms having a plurality of holes for a pin or stopper to pass through, said straight arms being held at a point with the help of a screw.<br>
In the above DDPS device the non-working ends of the tongs are held in position with the help of a stopper to operate the device. The opening ends of the C-shaped tongs are adjusted by shifting said stopper in the grooves according to the requirements.<br>
Novel Device used with Radiosurgery equipment has the following advantages:<br>
1)	Any deep pitted and depressed scar of any size and shape on skin can be treated with superior results.<br>
2)	No damage to the adjoining normal skin.<br><br>
3)	The soft material lining the ring to hold the skin can conform vary precisely with any shape of the scar.     <br>
4)	The desired position can be very steadily maintained during the whole Dermatosurgical procedure.	<br>
5)	The handle can be easily held by the assistant doctor away from The main surgical site thus not obstructing the Dermatosurgeon"s view.<br>
6)	The novel device can be properly sterilized before Dermatosurgery with either autoclave or chemical sterilization process.<br>
The novel DDPS device of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings accompanying the Provisional Specification wherein:<br>
Fig. 1   illustrates the perspective view of the novel device.<br>
Fig.2   illustrates separately the handle bar of the novel device showing the adjustment means as provided.<br>
According to the above drawings, Novel Device essentially comprises a pair of tongs (10,12) one end of which is made C-shaped (23) which is preferably fixed with pad (25). The said two limbs are held at a point with the help of a screw (30) to adjust the grip of the tongs. The grip can be either tightened or lossened by adjusting the position of the screw (30) along the length of the handle bar (40) provided with pluralities of holes (42,44,46) along its length as shown. The process of tightening and loosening of the screw is done manually to suit the purpose.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention DDPS device is provided with a hinged plate (50) in one of its tongs for locking the uplifted skin during the treatment of pitted scars and as illustrated in the drawing accompanying this Specification. The curve portion of both the tongs of the DDPS device are preferably cut at convenient point (55) to avoid pinching of skin while folding at a particular height. The inside curvature (58) to the tongs being provided with a support particular preferably made of silicon rubber for a better grip. Furthermore, the outside surface of the said curvature (58) are provided with a grip to push up lesion for more and better slackness while using the device.<br><br>
