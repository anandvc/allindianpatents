				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the simultaneous hydrbprocessing of two hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks.    Petroleum refiners<br>
often produce desirable products such as turbine fuel, diesel fuel and other products known as middle distillates as well as lower boiling hydrocarbonaceous liquids such as naphtha and gasoline by hydrocracking a hydrocarbon feedstock derived from crude oil, for example.    Feedstocks most often subjected to hydrocracking are gas oils and heavy gas oils recovered from crude oil by distillation.     A typical  heavy gas  oil  comprises a  substantial  portion  of hydrocarbon components boiling above 371 °C, usually at least 50 percent by weight boiling above 371 °C.   A typical vacuum gas oil normally has a boiling point range between 315°C and 565°C.<br>
Hydrocracking is generally accomplished by contacting in a hydrocracking reaction vessel or zone the gas oil or other feedstock to be treated with a suitable hydrocracking catalyst under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of hydrogen so as to yield a product containing a distribution of hydrocarbon products desired by the refiner. The operating conditions and the hydrocracking catalysts within a hydrocracking reactor influence the yield of the hydrocracked products.<br>
Although a wide variety of process flow schemes, operating conditions and catalysts have been used in commercial activities, there is always a demand for new hydrocracking methods which provide lower costs and higher liquid<br>
product yields and quality. It Is generally known that enhanced product selectivitycan be achieved at lower conversion per pass (60% to 90% conversion of fresh feed) through the catalytic hydfocracking zone. However, it was previously believed that any advantage of operating at below 60% conversion per pass was negligible or would only see diminishing returns. Low conversion per pass is generally more expensive, however, the present invention greatly improves the economic benefits of a low conversion per pass process and demonstrates the unexpected advantages.<br>
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE<br>
US-A-5,720,872   discloses   a   process   for   hydroprocessing   liquid feedstocks in two or more hydfoprocessing stages, which are in separate reaction   vessels   and   wherein   each   reaction   stage   contains   a   bed   of hydroprocessing catalyst. The liquid product from the first reaction stage is sent to a low pressure stripping stage and stripped of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and other dissolved gases.   The stripped product stream is then sent to the next downstream reaction stage, the product from which is also stripped of dissolved gases and sent to the next downstream reaction stage until the last reaction stage, the liquid product of which is stripped of dissolved gases and collected or passed on for further processing. The flow of treat gas is in a direction opposite the direction in which the reaction stages are staged for the flow of liquid.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a catalytic hydrocracking process which simultaneously hydroprocesses two feedstocks to provide higher liquid product yields and increase the quality of the liquid products. The process of the present invention provides the yield advantages associated with a low conversion per pass operation without compromising unit economics. In addition, lower capital costs will be realized with the use of the present invention.<br>
In the present invention,  a first hydrocarbonaceous feedstock and hydrogen are passed to a hydrocracking reaction zone to produce a stream containing lower boiling hydrocarbonaceous compounds which stream is in turn passed to a hot, high pressure stripper utilizing a hot, hydrogen-rich stripping gas to produce a vapor stream containing hydrogen and hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature below the first feedstock and a liquid stream containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling in the range of the first feedstock.    A second hydrocarbonaceous feedstock having a boiling temperature range lower than the first hydrocarbonaceous feedstock is passed into an upper end of the stripper to serve as reflux. The vapor stream containing hydrogen and hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature below the first feedstock is introduced into a post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone comprising a separate vessel to saturate at least a portion of the aromatic compbunds contained therein. At least a portion of the second feedstock is vaporized in the stripper and passes into the post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone to saturate aromatic compounds and thereby improve the quality of the hydrocarbonaceous effluent from the post-treat zone.  At least a portion of the effluent from the post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone is condensed to produce a second liquid stream containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature below the first feedstock and a second vapor stream containing hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide. In a preferred embodiment, at least a portioni of the hydrogen sulfide is removed from the second vapor stream before it is recycled to the hydrocracking zone.      The separate post-treat hydfogenatioh zone is maintained in a separate vessel since the second feed<br>
requires a higher temperature in the top of the hot high pressure stripper then is suitable for the post-treat hydrogenation zone.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment the present invention relates to a process for the simultaneous hyd reprocess ing of two feedstocks having different boiling ranges which process comprises: (a) passing a first hydrocarbonaceous feedstock and hydrogen to a hydrocracking zone containing a hydrocracking catalyst and operating at a temperature of 204°C to 482°C, a pressure from 3.44 mPa   to 17.2 mPa, a liquid hourly space velocity from 0.1hr-1 to 15hr-1 and recovering   a   hydrbcracking   zone   effluent   therefrom;   (b)   passing   the hydrocracking zone effluent directly to a hot, high pressure stripper utilizing a hot, hydrogen-rich stripping gas to produce a first vapor stream comprising hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature below the first hydrocarbonaceous feedstock, and a first liquid stream comprising hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling in the range of the first hydrbcarbbnaceous feedstock; (c) passing a second hydrocarbonaceous feedstock having a boiling temperature range lower than that of the first hydrobarbonaceous feedstock into an upper end of the stripper to serve as reflux; (d) passing at least a portion of the first vapor stream recovered in step (b) to a post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone contained in a separate vessel to saturate aromatic compounds; (e) condensing at least a portion of the resulting effluent from the post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone to produce a second liquid   stream   comprising   hydrobarbonaceous   compounds   boiling   at   a temperature below the first hydrocarbonaceous feedstock and a second vapor stream bbmprising hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide; and (f) recycling at least a portion of the second vapor stream to the hydrocracking zone.<br>
In a further embodiment at least a portion of the first liquid stream is recycled to the hydrocracking zone.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The drawing is a simplified process flow diagram of a preferred embbdiment of the present invention. The drawing is intended to be schematically illustrative of the present invention and not intended to be a limitation: thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is particularly useful for hydroprocessing two feedstocks to achieve higher liquid product yields and a lower cost of production. The feedstocks contain hydrocarbons and/or other organic materials to produce a product containing hydrocarbons and/or other organic materials of lower average boiling point and improved product characteristics such as improved cetane and smoke point, and reduced contaminants such as sulfur and nitrogen. The hydrocarbon feedstocks that may be subjected to hydroprocessing by the method of the invention include all mineral oils and synthetic oils (e.g., shale oil, tar sandi products, etc.) and fractions thereof.  The higher boiling hydrocarbon feedstocks include those containing components boiling above 288°C such as atmospheric gas oils, vacuum gas oils, deasphalted, vacuum, and atmospheric residua,  hydrotreated residual oils, coker distillates, straight run distillates, pyrolysis-derived oils, high boiling synthetic oils and cat cracker distillates. One preferred hydrocracking feedstock is a gas oil or other hydrocarbon fraction having at least 50% by weight and most usually at least 75% by weight, of its<br>
components boiling at temperatures above the end point of the desired product, which erid point, in the case of heavy gasoline, is generally in the range from 193°C to 215°C. One of the most preferred gas oil feedstocks will contain hydrocarbon cornponerits which boil above 288°C with best results being achieved with feeds containing at least 25 percent by volume of the components boiling between 315o0 and 538°C. Also included are petroleum distillates wherein at least 90 percent of the components boil in the range from 149°C to 426°C.<br>
the first selected feedstock is first introduced into a hydrocracking reaction zone at hydrocracking reaction conditions.    Preferred hydrocracking reaction conditions include a temperature from 204°C to 482°C, a pressure from 3.44   mPa to   17.2   mPa,   a   liquid   hourly  space   velocity   of   the   fresh hydrocarbonaceous feedstock from 0.1hr-1 to 10hr-1 with a hydrocracking catalyst. Trie hydrocracking zone may contain one or more beds of the same or different catalyst In one embodiment, when the preferred products are middle distillates the preferred hydrocracking catalysts utilize amorphous bases or low-level zeolite bases combined with one or more Group VIII or Group VIB metal hydrbgeiiating components.     In another embodiment,  when the preferred produdts are in the gasoline boiling range, the hydrocracking zone contains a catalyst which comprises, in general, any crystalline zeolite cracking base upon which isdeposited a minor proportion of a Group VIII metal hydrogenating component.    Additional hydrogenating components may be selected from Group VIB for incorporation with the zeolite base.   The zeolite cracking bases are sometimes referred to in the art as molecular sieves and are usually composed of silica, alumina and one or more exchangeable cations such as<br>
sodium^  magnesium, calcium, rare earth  metals,  etc.     They  are  further characterized by crystal pores of relatively uniform diameter between 4 and 14 Angstroms (10hr-10 meters).  It is preferred to employ zeolites having a relatively high silica/alumina mole ratio between 3 and 12.   Suitable zeolites found in nature include, for example, mordenite, stilbite, heulandite, ferrierite, dachiardite, chabazite,  erionite and faujasite.     Suitable synthetic zeolites  include,  for example, the B, X, Y and L crystal types, e.g., synthetic faujasite and mordenite. The preferred zeolites are those having crystal pore diameters between 8-12 Angstroms (10)-10 meters), wherein the silica/alumina mole ratio is 4 to 6.   A prime example of a zeolite falling in the preferred group is synthetic Y molecular sieve.<br>
The naturaloccurring zeolites are normally found in a sodium form, an alkaline earth metal form, or mixed forms. The synthetic zeolites are nearly always prepared first in the sodium form. In any case, for use as a cracking base it is preferred that most or all of the original zeolitic monovalent metals be ion-exchahged with a polyvalent metal and/or with an ammonium salt followed by heating to decompose the ammonium ions associated with the zeolite, leaving in their place hydrogen ions and/or exchange sites which have actually been decationized by further removal of water. Hydrogen or "decationized" Y zeolites of this nature are more particularly described in 3,130,006.<br>
Mixed polyvalent metal-hydrogen zeolites may be prepared by ion-exchanging first with an ammonium salt, then partially back exchanging with a polyvalent metal salt and then calcining. In some cases, as in the case of<br>
synthetic mordenite, the hydrogen forms can be prepared by direct acid treatment of the alkali metal zeolites. The preferred cracking bases are those which are at least 10 percent, and preferably at least 20 percent, metal-cation-deficient based on the initial ion-exchange capacity. A specifically desirable and stable class of zeolites are those wherein at least 20 percent of the ion exchange capacity is satisfied by hydrogen ions.<br>
the active metals employed in the preferred hydrocracking catalysts of the present invention as hydfogenation components are those of Group VIII, i.e., iron,  cobalt,   fiicke!,  ruthenium,rhodium,   palladium,   osmium,   iridium   and platinum! In addition to these metals, other promoters may also be employed in conjunction therewith, including the metals of Group VIB, e.g., molybdenum and tungsten;  The amount of hydrogehating metal in the catalyst can vary within wide ranges-    Broadly speaking, any amount between 0.05 percent and 30 percent by weight may be used.  In the case of the noble metals, it is normally preferred to use 0.05 to 2 weight percent.     The  preferred  method for incorporating the hydrogenating metal is to contact the zeolite base material with an aqueous solution of a suitable compound of the desired metal wherein the metal fe present in a cationic form.     Following addition of the selected hydrogenatirjO, metal or metals, the resulting catalyst powder is then filtered, dried, pelleted with added lubricants, binders or the like if desired, and calcined in air at temperatures of, e.g., 371°-648°C in order to activate the catalyst and decompose ammoniumions.  Alternatively, the zeolite component may first be pelleted, followed by the addition Of the hydrogenating component and activation by calcining. The foregoing catalysts may be employed in undiluted form, or the<br><br>
powdered zeolite catalyst may be mixed and copelleted with other relatively less active catalysts, diluents or binders such as alumina, silica gel, silica-alumina cogels, activated clays and the like in proportions ranging between 5 and 90 weight percent. These diluents may be employed as such or they may contain a minor proportion of an added hydrogenating metal such as a Group VIB and/or Group VIII metal.<br>
Additional metal promoted hydrbcracking catalysts may also be utilized in the process of the present invention which comprises, for example, aluminophosphate molecular sieves, crystalline chromosilicates and other crystalline silicates. Crystalline chromosilicates are more fully described in US-A-4,363,718;<br>
The hydrocracking of the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock in contact with a hydrbcracking catalyst is conducted in the presence of hydrogen and preferably at hydrocracking conditions which include a temperature from 232°C to 468°C, a pressur^ from 3.44 mPa to 20.7 mPa, a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) from 0.1 to 30hr-1, and a hydrogen circulation rate from 337 normal m3/m3 to 4200 normal m3/m3. In accordance with the present invention, the term "substantial conversion to lower boiling products" is meant to connote the conversion of at least 10 volume percent of the fresh feedstock. The conversion per pass in the hydrocracking zone is preferably in the range from 10% to 50% and more preferably in the range from 20% to 40%.<br>
The resulting effluent from the hydrocracking reaction zone is transferred without intehtiohal heat-exchange (uncooled) and is introduced into a hot, high<br><br>
pressure stripping zone maintained at essentially the same pressure as the hydrocracking  reaction  zone  where  it  is  countercurrently  stripped   with   a hydrogen-rich gaseous stream to produce a first gaseous hydrocarbonaceous stream containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature less than    371 °C,    hydrogen    sulfide    and    ammonia,    and    a    first    liquid hydrocarbonaceous stream containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature greater than 371 °C.     The  stripping zone  is  preferably maintained at a temperature in the range from 232°C to 468°C.   The effluent frdm  the hydrobracking reaction zone is not substantially cooled and would only be lower" in temperature due to unavoidable heat loss during transport from the reaction ;zone to the stripping zone.   It is preferred that the cooling of the hydrocrackingreactiori zone effluent is less than 84°C and more preferably less than 56°C,  By maintaining the pressure of the stripping zone at essentially the same pressure as the hydrocrackihg reaction zone is meant that any difference in pressure is due to the pressure drop required to flow the effluent stream from the reaction zone to the stripping zone.  It is preferred that the pressure drop is less than 1.03 mPa and more preferably less than 0.69 mPa. The hydrogen-rich gaseous strearn is preferably supplied to the stripping zone in an amount greater than 5 weight percent of the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock.    The second feedstock is introduced into the upper end of the hot, high pressure stripper to serve as reflux and to be processed further in accordance with the present inventiori.<br>
At least a portion of the first liquid hydrocarbonaceous stream containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature greater than 371°C<br><br>
recovered from the stripping zone is in one preferred embodiment recycled to the hydrbcracking reaction zone along with added hydrogen.<br>
The   resulting  first   gaseous   hydrocarbonaceous   stream   containing hydrocatbonaceous compounds boiling at a temperature less than 371°C, hydrogell, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia from the stripping zone is introduced into a separate vessel containing a post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone to hydrogehate at least a portion of the aromatic compounds in order to improve the quality of the middle distillate, particularly the jet fuel.  A portion of the first gaseous hydrocarbonaceOus stream contains at least a portion of the second feedstock.  The post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone may be conducted in a downflbw, upflow or radial flow mode of operation and may utilize any known hydrbgehation catalyst.<br>
Downflow is preferred for the reactor since the higher temperature required for the second feedstock will usually require intermediate heat exchange between the hot, high pressure stripper and the post-treat hydrogenation zone. Cooling of the first gasesous stream may produce mixed phase conditions that are best suited for downflow operation. The effluent from the post-treat hydrogenation reaction zone is cooled to a temperature in the range from 4.4oC to 60°C and at least partially condensed to produce a second liquid hydrocarbonaceous stream which is recovered and fractionated to produce desired hydrocarbon product streams. A portion of the second liquid hydrocarbonaceous stream may be recycled to the top of the hot, high pressure stripper along with the second feedstock. Condensed the second stream also produces a second hydrogen-rich gaseous stream which is bifurcated to provide<br><br>
at least a portion of the added hydrogen introduced into the hydrocracking zone as hereinabove described and at least a portion of the first hydrogen-rich gaseous stream introduced in the stripping zone. Fresh make-up hydrogen may be introduced into the process at any suitable and convenient location but is preferably introduced into the stripping zone.  Before the second hydrogen-rich gaseous stream is introduced into the hydrocracking zone, it is preferred that at least a significant portion, at least 90 weight percent, for example, of the hydrogen sulfide is removed and recovered by means of known, conventional methods.    In a preferred embodiment, the hydrogen-rich gaseous stream introduced into the hydrocracking zone contains less than 50 wppm hydrogen sulfide.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the second feedstock contains hydrocarbons and/or other organic materials and has a boiling range or at least a portibn thereof less than the first feedstock. The second feedstock preferably boils in the range from 149°C to 382°C. The second feedstock is introduced into the upper end of the hot, high pressure stripper to serve as reflux. Depending on the boiling range of the second feedstock and the operating conditions of the stripper, at least a portion may be vaporized and subsequently passed directly to the post-treat hydrogenatioh reaction zone wherein heteroatoms containing sulfur arid nitrogen are converted to hydrocarbons thereby producing hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, and aromatic compounds are saturated. The post treat hydrogenation reaction zone produces a hydrocarbon stream having improved product qualities.<br>

ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT<br>
A vacuum gas oil feedstock in the amount 91.4 m3/hr and having the characteristics presented in Table 1 is introduced into a hydrocracking zone containing a hydrocracking catalyst and operated at conditions including a pressure of 11.0 mPa, a temperature of 399°C and a hydrogen circulation rate 6f 1348 n m3/rh3. The hydrocracking zone effluent is introduced without cooling into a hot high pressure stripper operated at a pressure of 10.7 mPa   and a temperature of 399°C.  A diesel boiling range feedstock in the amount of 58.9 m3/hr and having the characteristics presented in Table 1 is introduced into an upper end of the hot, high pressure product stripper to serve as reflux and to be upgraded. A hot, hydrogen-rich stripping gas is introduced into the lower end of the stripper in an amount of 1264 nrm3/m3 based on the combined feeds.   A vapor stream containing hydfocracked hydrocarbon compounds and at least a majority ?of the diesel feedstock is removed from the high pressure product stripper and introduced into a post-treat zone containing a hydrogenation catalyst selected for its ability to saturate aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and is operated at conditions including a pressure of 10.7 mPa and a temperature of 349°C;   ; The resulting hydretreated gaseous hydrocarbonaceous stream is removed from the post-treat zone admixed with a wash water stream and Cooled.    A resulting cooled and partially condensed stream is separated to recover a spent aqueous stream, a liquid hydrocarbonaceous stream and a<br>
hydrogen-rich gaseous  stream,     the  recovered liquid  hydrocarbonaceous stream is stabilized and separated to yield a naphtha product in an amount of 17.2 m3/hr and a diesel product in an amount of 96.7 m3/hr and having a specific gravity of 0.849 at 15oC and a cetane index of 50.   A stream of unconverted hydrocarbons in an amount of 45:7 m3/hr is removed from the bottom of the high pressure! product stripper and recycled to the hydrocracking zone.    Another stream in an amount of 46.4 m3/hr and having a specific gravity of 0.886 at 15°C is  removed from the bottom of the high  pressure  product stripper and subsequently charged to a fluid catalytic cracking zone or otherwise employed.<br>
