RECEIVERS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[1001] The present invention relates generally to data communication, and more specifically to techniques for generating pseudo-random number (PN) sequences or vectors based on ROM(s).<br>
Background<br>
[1002] Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication such as voice, packet data, and so on, for a number of users. These systems may be based on code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), or some other multiple access technique. CDMA systems may provide certain advantages over other types of system such as increased capacity. A CDMA system may be designed to implement one or more CDMA standards such as IS-95, IS-2000, IS-856, W-CDMA, and so on, all of which are well known in the art.<br>
[1003] In a CDMA system, data to be transmitted over the air is spectrally spread over the entire system bandwidth to combat deleterious transmission effects such as fading and multipath. At a transmitter, the spectral spreading is performed by multiplying the data to be transmitted with a pseudo-random number (PN) sequence. The spread data is further processed to generate a modulated signal, which is then transmitted over the air.<br>
[1004] Due to artifacts in the propagation environment (e.g., building, natural structures, and so on), the modulated signal transmitted from a given transmitter may reach a receiver via a number of signal paths. The received signal at the receiver may thus include a number of multipath components (or signal instances), each of which corresponds to the signal received via a respective propagation path. Since the receiver may receive signals from multiple transmitters, the received signal may thus include a number of multipath components for a number of transmitters.<br>
[1005] To recover a given multipath component in the received signal, a complementary spectral despreading operation is performed at the receiver.    The<br><br>
received signal is initially conditioned and digitized to provide samples, and the samples are then despread with a (complex-conjugated) PN sequence corresponding to the one used at the transmitter. To recover the multipath component, the PN sequence used at the receiver needs to be aligned in time with the time of the arrival of the multipath component. Thus, the phase (or offset) of the PN sequence used at the receiver to recover the multipath component is dependent on both the offset of the PN sequence used at the transmitter and the propagation delay of the multipath component. [1006] For a CDMA system, a rake receiver is often used to concurrently process a number of multipath components in the received signal. The rake receiver typically includes one or more searcher elements (or simply "searchers") and a number of demodulation elements (often referred to as "fingers")- Each searcher may be operated to process the received signal to search for strong multipath components. Each finger may then be assigned to process a multipath component of sufficient strength to recover the transmitted data.<br>
[1007] Each searcher despreads the samples with PN sequences at various offsets, with each PN offset corresponding to a hypothesis being evaluated. In particular, to search for strong multipath components, each searcher typically performs a number of correlations of the samples with PN sequences at various offsets. Each correlation results in a high value if the PN sequence used for despreading is time-aligned with that of a multipath component, and a low .value otherwise.<br>
[1008] Each finger similarly despreads the samples with a PN sequence at a particular offset. This PN offset, which is dependent in part on the arrival time of the multipath component, may be initially determined by the searcher and thereafter tracked by the finger.<br>
[1009] Conventionally, a dedicated PN generator is provided for each finger and used to generate the PN sequence at the desired offset. Similarly, a dedicated PN vector generator is provided for each searcher and used to generate the necessary PN vectors. (A PN vector is a short (e.g., 8-chip) segment of a PN sequence.) This conventional design includes a number of individual PN generators for a number of fingers and searchers. The total circuitry for all such PN generators may comprise a relatively large portion of the integrated circuit for the rake receiver. For this design, the PN generator circuitry grows as the number of searchers and fingers in the receiver increases.<br><br>
[1010] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques for generating PN sequences or vectors for the searchers and fingers of a rake receiver, and which may be implemented with reduced circuitry.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[1011] ROM-based PN generation techniques are described herein which can provide PN vectors for various processing units (e.g., fingers and searchers of a rake receiver). In one specific embodiment, a device operable to provide PN vectors includes a request arbitration unit, an address generator, and a buffering unit. The request arbitration unit receives a number of requests for PN vectors from a number of processing units, selects requests for processing if the processing order is not already specified, and provides a control indicative of each request selected for processing. The address generator provides a set of one or more addresses for each selected request. The addresses may be dependent on (1) a particular PN sequence (e.g., a particular scrambling code number) being requested and (2) the offset (or phase) of that PN sequence, which may in turn be dependent on the time of arrival of the multipath component being processed.<br>
[1012] One or more memory units (which may be implemented internal or external to the device) store all "base" PN sequences (e.g., an X(z) sequence and a Y(z) sequence defined by W-CDMA) that may be used to generate all requestable PN vectors. The memory unit(s) then provide one or more segments of one or more base PN sequences, based on the set of one or more addresses. The buffering unit provides a set of one or more PN vectors derived from the one or more PN segments for each selected request. This buffering, unit may shift each PN segment by a particular number of bit positions determined by the scrambling code number associated with the selected request. [1013] The received requests may be processed in a time multiplexed manner, one request at a time, based on a particular priority assignment scheme. In an embodiment, the device can provide a set of up to three PN vectors (e.g., for a main scrambling code, a first auxiliary scrambling code, and a second auxiliary scrambling code) for each finger request, and a single PN vector (e.g., for the main scrambling code) for each searcher request. The device may also be designed to provide a primary synchronization code (PSC) vector for each finger request. Each PN vector may cover an 8-chip period.<br><br>

The invention further provides integrated circuits, methods, program codes, digital signal processors, receiver units, transmitter units, terminals, base stations, systems, and other apparatuses and elements that implement various aspects, embodiments, and features of the invention, as described in further detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1024] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a wireless communication system 100 that supports a number of users. System 100 includes a number of base stations 104 that provide coverage for a number of geographic regions 102. The base station is also referred to as a base transceiver system (BTS) or an access point, and the base station and/or its coverage area are also often referred to as a cell. System 100 may be designed to implement one or more CDMA standards such as W-CDMA, IS-95, IS-2000, IS-856, and so on, all of which are well known in the art and incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[1025] As shown in FIG. 1, various terminals 106 are dispersed throughout the system. Each terminal 106 may communicate with one or more base stations 104 on the forward and reverse links at any given moment, depending on whether or not the terminal is active and whether or not it is in soft handoff. The forward link (i.e., downlink) refers to transmission from the base station to the terminal and the reverse link (i.e., uplink) refers to transmission from the terminal to the base station. [1026] In the example shown in FIG. 1, base station 104a transmits to terminal 106a on the forward link, base station 104b transmits to terminals 106b, 106c, and 1061, and so on. Terminal 106b is in soft handoff and receives transmissions from base stations 104b and 104d. In FIG. 1, a solid line with an arrow indicates a user-specific data transmission from the base station to the terminal. A broken line with an arrow indicates that the terminal is receiving pilot and other signaling, but no user-specific data transmission, from the base station. The reverse link communication is not shown in FIG. 1 for simplicity.<br>
[1027] FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of base station 104 and terminal 106. On the forward link, at base station 104, a transmit (TX) data processor 214 receives different types of traffic such as user-specific data from a data source 212, messages from a controller 230, and so on. TX data processor 214 then formats and codes the data and messages based on one or more coding schemes to provide coded data. Each coding scheme may include any combination of cyclic redundancy check (CRC), convolutional, Turbo, block, and other coding, or no coding at all. Typically, different types of traffic are coded using different coding schemes. [1028] A modulator (MOD) 216 then receives pilot.data and the coded data from TX data processor 214 and further processes the received data to provide modulated data. For a CDMA system, modulator 216 "covers" the coded and pilot data with different channelization codes to channelize the user-specific data, messages, and pilot data onto their respective code channels. For a CDMA system, modulator 216 further spectrally spreads the channelized data with a (complex) pseudo-random number (PN) sequence having a particular offset assigned to the base station. The modulated data is then provided to a transmitter (TMTR) 218 and conditioned (e.g., converted to one or more analog signals, amplified, filtered, and quadrature modulated) to generate a modulated signal that is suitable for transmission via an antenna 220 and over a wireless link to the terminals.<br><br>
[1029] At terminal 106, the modulated signal is received by an antenna 250 and provided to a receiver (RCVR) 252 (which may also be referred to as a "front-end" unit). Receiver 252 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and quadrature downconverts) the received signal and further digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples. A demodulator (DEMOD) 254 then receives and processes the samples to provide demodulated data. The received signal may include a number of multipath components for a number of base stations. For each multipath component to be processed, demodulator 254 (1) spectrally despreads the samples with the PN sequence used to spectrally spread the data at the base station, (2) "decovers" the despread samples to channelize the received data and messages onto their respective code channels, and (3) data demodulates the channelized data with a pilot recovered for the multipath component. Demodulator 254 may implement a rake receiver that can concurrently process a number of multipath components, as described below.<br>
[1030] A receive (RX) data processor 256 then receives and decodes the demodulated data from demodulator 256 to recover the user-specific data and messages transmitted on the forward link. The processing by demodulator 254 and RX data processor 256 is complementary to that performed by modulator 216 and TX data processor 214, respectively, at base station 104.<br>
[1031] The terminology used to describe the processing performed by modulator 216 at the base station and demodulator 254 at the terminal may be different for different CDMA standards. For a W-CDMA system, the channelization is referred to as "spreading" and the spectral spreading is referred to as "scrambling". The channelization codes for the "spreading" are orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes, and the PN sequences for the "scrambling" are referred to as scrambling codes. For an IS-95 or IS-2000 system, the channelization is referred to as "covering" and the spectral spreading is referred to as "spreading". The channelization codes for the "covering" are Walsh codes or quasi-orthogonal codes, and the PN sequences for the "spreading" are referred to as PN sequences.<br>
[1032]       The ROM-based PN generation techniques described herein may be used for various CDMA standards and designs. For clarity, various aspects and embodiments of the ROM-based PN generation are specifically described for the W-CDMA standard. [1033]       FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a demodulator 254a that includes a ROM-based PN generator.   Demodulator 254a, which is one embodiment of demodulator 254 in<br><br>
FIG- 2, may be used to search for strong multipath components in the received signal and to demodulate one or more multipath components of sufficient strength. Demodulator 254a implements a rake receiver that includes S searcher elements 310 (or simply "searchers") and F demodulation elements 320 (or demodulation fingers or simply "fingers"), where S and F can each be any integer one or greater. [1034] The modulated signal transmitted from each base station may be received by a given terminal via multiple propagation paths. The received signal at the terminal may thus include a number of multipath components for one or more base stations. Each searcher 310 may be used to search for strong multipath components in the received signal and to provide an indication of the strength and timing of each found multipath component that meets one or more criteria. Typically, each searcher 310 searches for the pilots transmitted from the base stations to find these multipath components.<br>
[1035] One finger 320 may then be assigned to process each multipath component of interest (e.g., as determined by controller 260 based on the signal strength and timing information provided by searchers 310). For example, each multipath component of sufficient strength may be assigned to, and processed by, a respective finger of the rake receiver. Each finger processes (e.g., descrambles, despreads, and data demodulates) the assigned multipath component to provide demodulated symbols for that multipath component. The demodulated symbols from all assigned fingers for a particular data transmission may then be combined to provide recovered symbols for that data transmission.<br>
[1036] As shown in FIG. 3, the complex. samples (i.e., the inphase IN and quadrature Qin samples) from receiver 252 may be provided directly to all assigned fingers 320 and to a sample buffer 308. Buffer 308 stores the samples for subsequent processing by searchers 310 and fingers 320, and provides the stored samples to each searcher 310 and each finger 320 as they are needed. The stored samples may be processed by the fingers for some offline processing.<br>
[1037] Each searcher 310 operates in conjunction with controller 260 and a PN generator 330. Within each activated searcher 310, the pertinent complex samples are retrieved from sample buffer 308 and provided to a descrambler 312. Typically, the searcher is designed to process a segment of samples at a time, in which case a corresponding PN vector is provided to the despreader by PN generator 330.  The PN<br><br>
vector has a specific offset corresponding to a hypothesis being evaluated. For W-CDMA, this PN vector is a short segment of a scrambling sequence or code. [1038] Descrambler 312 performs a complex multiply of the complex samples with the complex PN sequence and provides complex descrambled samples. The descrambled samples are further despread with a channelization code for the pilot (which is OVSF code of zero in W-CDMA) to provide pilot samples. A signal strength detector 316 then estimates the signal strength of the pilot for the hypothesis being evaluated, and provides the estimated signal strength to controller 260. [1039] Within each assigned finger 320, the complex samples are provided to a descrambler 322, which also receives a complex PN sequence from PN generator 320. The PN sequence has a specific offset that is dependent on the time of arrival of the multipath component being processed and the offset of the PN sequence used at the transmitter. This arrival time (or PN offset) may be initially determined by the searcher and thereafter tracked by the finger. Descrambler 322 performs a complex multiply of the samples with the PN sequence and provides descrambled samples, which are further despread by despreaders 324a and 324b with the channelization codes for the user-data and the pilot, respectively. The pilot samples from despreader 324b are further filtered by a pilot filter 328 to provide a pilot estimate. A data demodulator 326 then demodulates the despread samples from despreader 324a with the pilot estimate to provide demodulated symbols for the assigned multipath component. [1040] A symbol combiner 340 combines the demodulated symbols from all fingers assigned to process a given data transmission. Symbol combiner 340 then provides recovered symbols, which may be decoded to recover the transmitted data. The design and operation of a rake receiver such as that shown in FIG. 3 is described in further detail in the U.S Patent Nos. 5,764,687 and 5,490,165, which are incorporated herein by reference,<br>
[1041] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, PN generator 330 provides the PN sequences for all active searchers 310 and fingers 320. For W-CDMA, these PN sequences are referred to as scrambling codes. In accordance with document 3GPP TS 25,213 V3.6.0 of the W-CDMA standard, a total of 215 -1 = 262,143 possible scrambling codes can be generated and are labeled as scrambling codes k = 0... 262,142.   However, only some of these scrambling codes may be used for<br><br>
scrambling, and these "usable" scrambling codes are divided into 512 sets.   Each set includes one primary scrambling code and 15 secondary scrambling codes. [1042]       The 512 primary codes in the 512 sets are scrambling codes k=16*/, where i = 0...511.  The 15 secondary scrambling codes in the /-th set are scrambling codes fc = 16*i + j, where j = 1... 15 .   There is a one-to-one mapping between each<br>
primary scrambling code and its associated set of 15 secondary scrambling codes such that z'-th primary scrambling code corresponds to /-th set of secondary scrambling codes. [1043] The 512 sets include scrambling codes k =0...S191. Each of these "regular" scrambling codes is associated with a left alternative scrambling code and a right alternative scrambling code, both of which may be used for "compressed" frames. (For a compressed frame, data is transmitted in a portion of the frame so that the remaining portion of the frame may be used to perform inter-system measurements.) The left alternative scrambling code corresponding to regular scrambling code k is scrambling code fc + Sl92, and the right alternative scrambling code corresponding to regular scrambling code k is scrambling code k + 16384.<br>
[1044]       Table 1 shows the scrambling codes defined by W-CDMA.<br><br><br>
[1045] FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a scrambling code generator 400 for W-CDMA. The scrambling codes used for W-CDMA are gold codes that are generated with two linear feedback shift registers, X_LFSR 412 and Y_LFSR 422. XJLFSR 412 implements the primitive (over GF(2)) polynomial l + je7+x18, and Y_LFSR 422 implements the polynomial 1-f- x5 + x + x10 + xxs.  Each LFSR generates a specific PN<br>
sequence of length 2:s-l, with the bit pattern being determined by the assigned polynomial. X_LFSR 412 and Y_LFSR 422 are initialized as follows:<br>
A(0) = 1, X(1) = X(2)= ... x(17) = 0?and y(0) = y(l) = y(2)=... y(17) = l1<br>
where x(w) and y(/n) are the output of the m-th delay elements in the XJLFSR and Y_LFSR, respectively. The output from the 17-th delay element, x(17), after the /-th shift is denoted as X(/X and the output from the 17-th delay element, y(17), after the z-th shift is denoted as Y(/).<br>
[1046] For W-CDMA, different scrambling codes can be generated by (1) shifting the XJLFSR while keeping the Y_LFSR fixed and (2) combining the shifted output from the XJLFSR and the output from the Y_LFSR. The output from X_LFSR 412, which is denoted as X(Q, is thus shifted by a mask unit 414 by n chips to provide the shifted output, X(i+n). The parameter n for mask unit 414 determines the number of PN chips to shift X(Q, with each PN shift corresponding to a different scrambling code number. Since there are a total of 24,576 scrambling codes (i.e., 8192 x 3) that may be used in W-CDMA, n ranges from 0 to 24,575 and represents a 15-bit scrambling code number. The shifted output, X(i+n), is further shifted by a mask unit 416 by 131,072 chips to provide a shifted output, X(z+n+131,072). Similarly, the output from YJLFSR 422, which is denoted as Y(i), is shifted by a mask unit 426 by 131,072 chips to provide a shifted output, Y(f+131,072). The masking operation performed by the mask units to shift the PN sequences is known in the art and not described in detail herein. [1047] The output X(i+n) from mask unit 414 and the output Y(i) from YJLFSR 422 are added by a modulo-2 adder 418 to provide an inphase scrambling code, I(i'). Correspondingly, the output X(/+?z+131,072) from mask unit 416 and the output Y(/+131,072) from mask unit 426 are added by a modulo-2 adder 428 to provide a<br><br>
quadrature scrambling code, Q(z). 1(0 and Q(f) are components of a complex scrambling code, Z„(0, which may be expressed as Z,,(/) = 1(0 +7 Q(z). [104S] For W-CDMA, each scrambling code has a length of 38,400 chips, which is the duration of one 10 msec frame. Thus, the index i in the 1(0 and Q(0 sequences ranges from 0 to 3S,399. For any given scrambling code n, the bit pattern for / = 0...38,399 is repeated for each frame to provide a continuous sequence. As shown<br>
in FIG. 4, 1(0 is generated based on X(H-/Z) and Y(/), and Q(/) is generated based on X0'+;?+131,072) and Y(f+131,072), where n ranges from 0 to 24,575. [1049] In a specific implementation of the ROM-based PN generator, all bit values for X(/+/i) and X(i+n+131,072) needed to derive valid scrambling codes are stored in an X.ROM, and all bit values for Y(0 and Y(/+131,072) needed to derive valid scrambling codes are stored in a YJROM, where i = 0... 38,399 and n =0... 24,575. The 1(f) and Q(z) sequences for any given scrambling code n may then be generated by retrieving the proper bit values for X(i) and Y(0 from the X_ROM and YJROM, and combining the retrieved bit values.<br>
[1050] To generate 1(f), the X_ROM may be designed to store the bit values X(0) ... X(62,975), where 62,975 = 38,400 + 24,576 - 1, and the Y.ROM may be designed to store the bit values Y(0)... Y(38,399). To generate Q(i), the X.ROM may be designed to store the values X(131,072) ... X(194,047), where 194,047 = 131,072 + 38:400 + 24,576 - 1, and the Y_ROM may be designed to store the values Y(131,072) ... Y(169,471), where 169,471= 131,072 + 38,400 - 1.<br>
[1051] In an embodiment, the ROM-based PN generator is designed with the capability to provide a WPN vector" for a particular scrambling code n for each clock cycle! In an embodiment, the PN vector comprises an 8-bit vector for I(z) and an 8-bit vector for Q(f), and may be used for descrambling by a finger or searcher. In an embodiment, the PN vector is provided for a particular PN phase p that is aligned to an 8-chip boundary (i.e., p = 0, 8, 16, ... or 38,392). The PN vector may be generated based on (1) 8 bits for X(n+p) through Y(w+/H-7) and 8 bits for X(«+/H-131,072) through X(;i+p+131,079) from the X.ROM, and (2) S bits for Y(p) through Y(p+7) and S bits for Yfc+131,072) through Yfc+131,079) from the Y.ROM. [1052] FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a specific embodiment of a bank of ROMs 500 used to store the X(0 and Y(/) bit values used to generate the PN vectors for W-CMDA.<br><br>
In a specific implementation, each individual ROM is able to provide a 16-bit word for each read cycle.<br>
[1053] In an embodiment, the XJROM is implemented with two 4Kxl6 ROMs, X1JROM and X2J3.0M. The Xl_ROM is further partitioned into an upper bank labeled as XII.ROM and a lower bank labeled as XQl_ROM. The XI1JROM stores the even numbered bytes of the sequence X(0) ... X(62,975), and the XQl_ROM stores the even numbered bytes of the sequence X( 131,072) ... X(194,047), as shown in FIG. 5. The X2JROM is similarly partitioned into an upper bank labeled as XI2JROM and a lower bank labeled as XQ2„ROM. The XI2_ROM stores the odd numbered bytes of the sequence X(8) ... X(62,975), and the XQ2__ROM stores the odd numbered bytes of the sequence X(131,QS0) ... X(194,047). Each row of the X1JROM and X2_ROM stores one 16-bit word.<br>
[1054] For the implementation of the X.ROM shown in FIG. 5, a 16-bit word of the sequence X(0) ... X(62,975) may be retrieved from the XIl.ROM and XI2_ROM for each read cycle, and an S-bit vector corresponding to the desired scrambling code ;z may be extracted from the retrieved word. Similarly, a 16-bit word of the sequence X(131,072) ... X(194,047) may be retrieved from the XQl_ROM and XQ2.ROM for each read cycle, and an 8-bit vector corresponding to the desired scrambling code n may also be extracted from this retrieved word. Thus, by using two ROMs each with the capability to provide a 16-bit output for each read cycle, two 8-bit vectors at any offset may be obtained and used to generate the PN vector for any desired scrambling code. [1055] In an alternative implementation, the entire sequence X(0)... X(62,975) may be stored in the X1JROM, and the entire sequence X(131,072) ... X(194,047) may be stored in the X2JROML For this implementation, for each PN vector to be generated, up to two 16-bit words are retrieved from each of the X1JR.OM and X2_ROM, and an 8-bit vector corresponding to the desired scrambling code is then extracted from the retrieved 16-bit words. The number of words to be retrieved is dependent on whether the 8 bits needed from the Xl_ROM are stored in one or two words, which in turn is dependent on the code number.<br>
[1056] In an embodiment, the Y_ROM is implemented with one 5Kxl6 ROM. The YJR.OM is partitioned into an upper bank labeled as YI_ROM and a lower bank labeled as YQJtOM. The YIJfcOM stores all bytes of the sequence Y(0)... Y(3S,399), and the YCLROM stores all bytes of the sequence Y(131,072) ... Y(169,471), as shown in FIG.<br><br>
5. Since the PN vectors to be provided by the ROM-based PN generator are aligned at S-chip boundary, one 16-bit word is retrieved from the YJROM at the PN phase p for each read cycle and may be used to generate both the inphase 1(f) and quadrature Q(f) components of the PN vector.<br>
[1057] The following parameters may be used to derive the PN vector for the desired scrambling code n at the desired PN phase p:<br>
•	pn_c?njcS - the PN count value that is indicative of the current PN phase for a<br>
given scrambling code (given with chipxS or 1/8 chip resolution);<br>
•	baddr- the phase p of the PN vector (given with 8-chip resolution); and<br>
•	codenum - the scrambling code n.<br>
[1058] The pnj:nt_x§ may be maintained by each finger/searcher for the multipath component being processed by that finger/searcher. In an embodiment, a system timer is maintained by the receiver and provides a system reference count value, refjcnt, which is indicative of system time and provided with chipxS resolution. All timing for the receiver may then be referenced to this system reference count value. For a given finger/searcher, pnjcntjcS may be expressed as:<br>
pnjcnt^xS = (ref_cnt - tar_pos + adv - ret) mod (38,400 * 8) ,       Eq (1)<br>
where<br>
tarjpos is the difference between the system reference time and the phase of the<br>
PN sequence used for descrambling; adv is the amount to advance the PN sequence; and ret is the amount to retard or delay the PN sequence.<br>
In equation (1), adv and ret are used to adjust the phase of the PN sequence to account for changes in the arrival time of the multipath component being processed by the finger (adv and ret may be set to zero for the searchers). As shown in equation (1), since the PN sequence has a periodicity of 38,400 chips in W-CDMA, pnjzntjcZ also has a period of 38,400 chips and is reset when it reaches the end of the sequence, which is performed for by the mod (38,400 * 8) operation.<br><br>
[1059] Since pnjcnt_x8 has chipxS resolution and baddr has 8-chip resolution, baddr may be obtained by discarding the 6 least significant bits (LSBs) o(pn_cntjc%, as foilows:<br>
baddr{12:0) = pn_art_x8[l&amp;:6] .	Eq (2)<br>
Since the finger and searcher require the PN generator to provide the PN vector for the next 8-chip period, and not the current S-chip period, the PN generator is provided with the phase for the next PN vector, which may be computed as:<br>
baddr[12:0] = (pn_cnt_x8[l8:6] + 1) mod 4S00 .<br>
Each finger/searcher that desires a PN vector provides the baddr and codenum to the PN<br>
generator.<br>
[1060]       To generate a PN vector for scrambling code codenum with phase baddr, the<br>
start bit address for the X(i) vector used to generate the PN vector can be computed as:<br>
xjxddr = codenum + {baddr * 8) .	Eq (3)<br>
The byte address for the X(f) vector is then:<br>
xj&gt;addr = x_addr[l2:3] .	Eq (4)<br>
As shown in HG. 5, for each 8-bit PN vector, a 16-bit word for XI is retrieved from both the XI1JIOM and XI2JIOM, and a 16-bit word for XQ is retrieved from both the XQl_ROM and XQ2.ROM.<br>
[1061] Jfxjbaddris an even numbered address (i.e., xj?addr[0] = 0), then the same word address may be used for both Xl_ROM and X2JROM, which is:<br>
xljwaddr= xljwaddr = xjbaddr[\2:l].	Eq (5)<br>
Two 16-bit words are then retrieved from the X1JROM and X2_ROM at word addresses xl^waddr andx2_waddr, respectively, as follows:<br>
xljtata = Xl_ROM[xl__waddr], and	Eq (6)<br>
xljtata = X2JlOM[-r2_vv^r] .<br><br>
The 16-bit words for XI and XQ are then obtained from the retrieved words, as follows:<br>
xLword=[(xljdata[l5:S]&amp;x2_data[15:$]) , and	Eq (7)<br>
xqjword = {(xl_data[l:0] &amp;x2_data[l:Q}) .<br>
[1062] Of the 16 bits retrieved from the Xl_ROM and X2^ROM for the words xijiata and xqjiata, only S bits of each word are used to generate the PN vector. The offset of these 8 bits in the word can be determined as:<br>
xjdatajsel = xjiddr[2:0] .	Eq (8)<br>
The two bytes, xijiata and xqjiata, used to generate the PN vector can then be obtained as:<br>
xijiata = [xijvord«xjdata_sel}[15:$] , and	Eq (9)<br>
xqjiata = [xqj\&gt;ord«xjdatajsel}[l5:&amp;] .<br>
The xijiata and xqjiata bytes are obtained by shifting the xi_word and xq_word to the left by xjdatajsel bit positions, discarding the xjiatajsel bits that have been shifted out of the words, and retaining the upper byte of the words.<br>
[1063] If xjbaddr is an odd number (i.e., xjbaddr[0] = 1), then different word addresses are used forXl_ROM and X2_ROM, which are:<br>
xljwaddr = xjbaddr[l2:l] + 1, and	Eq (10)<br>
xljvaddr = xjbaddr[l2:l].<br>
Two 16-bit words are then retrieved from the Xl_ROM and X2JROM at word addresses xljwaddr and x2jvaddr, as shown in equation (6). The 16-bit words for XI and XQ are then obtained from the retrieved words, as follows:<br>
xijvord= {(x2jkaa[l5:%] &amp; xljdata[15:SJ) , and	Eq (11)<br>
xq_word= {(x2jlata[T.0]&amp;xljdata[7:Q]) .<br><br>
a can oe noted that the bytes are concatenated together in a different order in equation (11) than that shown for equation (7).   The two bytes, xijdata and xqjlata. used to generate the PN vector can then obtained as shown in equation (9). [1064]       The start bit address for the Y(7) vector used to generate the desired PN vector and the word address for the Y_ROM are similarly computed as:<br>
y__addr = codenwn -f (baddr * 8), and	Eq (12)<br>
yjvaddr = y_addr[ 12:3] .<br>
The 16-bit word retrieved from the Y_ROM is then:<br>
yjiata = Y„ROM[y_waddr].	Eq (13)<br>
The two bytes, yijiata and yqjiata, used to generate the PN vector can then be obtained as:<br>
yijiata = y_data[l5:Z], and	Eq (14)<br>
yqjiata =y_data[l:0].<br>
Since the PN vector is provided at the 8-chip boundary, only one word needs to be retrieved from the'YJIOM for yjiata, which includes both yijiata and yqjiata. Moreover, no shifting of yjiata is needed to obtain yijiata znd.yqjiata. [1065]       The PN vector can then be generated as follows:<br>
pnijiata = xijiata XOR yijiata , and	Eq (15)<br>
pnqjiata = xqjiata XOR yqjiata ,<br>
where pnijiata and pnqjiata are 8-bit vectors of the 1(f) and Q(i) sequences, respectively, for scrambling code number n (i.e., codenwn) and PN phase p (i.e., baddr). [1066] In an embodiment, a primary synchronization code (PSC) may also be provided by the ROM-based PN generator. The PSC is a specific 256-chip sequence that is inserted at the start of each (0.667 msec) slot in a primary common control physical channel (P-CCPCH) in W-CDMA. The PSC is further XORed with a value of one ("1") or zero ("0") depending on whether or not STTD mode is enabled. The PSC<br><br>
may thus be used by the receiver to (1) determine the start of each slot and (2) detect whether or not STTD mode is enabled.<br>
[1067] In an embodiment, the 256-chip PSC is stored in the last 256 bit positions (i.e., the last 16 words) in the Y_ROM. This Y_ROM is then designed with sufficient size to store the 3S,400 bit values for Y(i) as well as the 256 bit values for the PSC. The address of a PSC word in the Y_ROM may be computed as:<br>
psc_waddr = psc_saddr + y_addr[l:A] ,	Eq (16)<br>
where psc__saddr is the start word address where the PSC is stored in the Y_ROM (e.g., psc_saddr = 5K - 16, where 5K is the highest word address for the YJROM). The 16-bit word retrieved from the YJROM for the PSC is then:<br>
pscjword = YJRQM[psc_waddr] .	Eq (17)<br>
A 16-bit PSC word comprised of two 8-bit PSC vectors is retrieved from the Y_ROM for each read cycle. However, only one PSC vector needs to be provided by the PN generator for a given clock cycle. The particular PSC vector to be provided is determined by yjbaddr. In particular, the PSC vector for the upper byte of the pscjword is provided if y_baddr[0] is an even number, and the PSC vector for the lower byte of the psc_word is provided if yj?addr[0] is an odd number. This may be expressed as follows:<br>
psc_data =psc_word[ 15:8], if yj&gt;addr[0] is an even number, and   Eq (18)<br>
psc_data =psc_word[1:0],   if yJbaddr[G] is an odd number.<br>
[1068] FIG. 6 is" a block diagram of a specific embodiment of a ROM-based PN generator 330a. PN generator 330a, which is one embodiment of PN generator 330 in FIG. 3, includes a PN request arbitration unit 610, an address and control signal generator 620, a bank of ROMs 630, and a bit alignment and buffering unit 640. [1069] Request arbitration unit 610 receives requests for PN vectors from all active fingers and searchers, selects one PN request for processing at any given moment, and provides a control indicative of the selected request. For each PN request selected for processing, address and control signal generator 620 determines the proper ROM addresses (which are dependent on the desired scrambling code and PN count value)<br><br>
and further provides the necessary ROM controls. ROMs 630 store the necessary portions of the X(z) and Y(/) sequences and the entire PSC sequence, and provide the proper X(i), Y(z'), and/or PSC words at the ROM addresses provided by generator 620. Bit alignment and buffering unit 640 receives the X(0 and Y(0 words, shifts the X(/) word based on the scrambling code number, derives the PN vector or the PSC vector, and provides buffering for the output vector. Each of units 610, 620, and 640 is described in further detail below.<br>
[1070] In an embodiment, each finger/searcher provides a request whenever it desires a set of one or more PN vectors for descrambling. The request from each finger may be provided via a respective request signal. fiix_pnreq, where x = 0, 1, ... (F-l). Similarly, the request from each searcher may be provided via a respective request signal, srxjpnreq, wherex = 0, 1, ... (S-l).<br>
[1071] Each finger may request up to three PN vectors for a given PN request. The three PN vectors are for a main scrambling code, a first auxiliary scrambling code, and a second auxiliary scrambling code. The main scrambling code is one of the primary scrambling codes in Table 1, and the first and second auxiliary scrambling codes may each be a secondary scrambling code, a left alternative scrambling code, or a right alternative scrambling code. Each finger may also request a PN vector (for the main scrambling code) and a PSC vector for a given PN request. Since the PSC is not used simultaneously with the auxiliary scrambling codes for any finger, the address and PSC vector for the PSC may be multiplexed with the address and PN vector, respectively, for the first auxiliary scrambling code. Each searcher requests one PN vector for the primary scrambling code for each PN request.<br>
[1072] Each finger and searcher also provide a respective set of parameters needed by the PN generator to provide the proper set of one or more PN vectors. In an embodiment, each finger provides the following parameters:<br>
•	a PN count value with 8-chip resolution, fnxj&gt;addry which is indicative of the<br>
byte address of the PN vector(s)  to be provided for the finger (e.g., fiixj&gt;addr = pn_cnt_xZ[l$:6])•	the number of PN vectors, fivcjiumcode, to be provided for the PN request,<br>
which may be 0,1, or 2;<br>
•	the main scrambling code number, fiix_main_codenum;<br>
•	the first auxiliary scrambling code number, fiix_aaxl_codenumJ if any;<br><br>
•	the second auxiliary scrambling code number, fixxjiuxljcodenwn, if any; and<br>
•	a PSC selection signal, fiixjisc_sel7 which indicates whether or not a PSC vector<br>
is to be provided to the finger-In an embodiment, each searcher provides the following parameters:<br>
•	a PN count value with 8-chip resolution, srx_bciddr, which is indicative of the<br>
byte address of the PN vector to be provided for the searcher; and<br>
•	the main scrambling code number, srx main codenum.<br>
[1073] A specific design for units 610, 620, and 640 of ROM-based PN generator 330a is described below. In general, the ROM-based PN generator may be designed to support any number of fingers and any number of searchers. For clarity, the specific design described below supports 12 fingers and 4 searchers (i.e., F = 12, and S = 4). In general, the ROM-based PN generator may be designed to provide PN vectors of any length. For clarity, each PN vector covers S chips in the specific design described below.<br>
[1074] FIG. 7 is a block diagram of a request arbitration unit 610a, which is one embodiment of request arbitration unit 610 in FIG. 6. Request arbitration unit 610a receives requests from all fingers and searchers desiring PN vectors. Since a PN vector covers an 8-chip period, one PN request may be provided by each active finger/searcher to request arbitration unit 610a for each 8-chip period.<br>
[1075] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 7, the PN request from each finger/searcher is provided to the "S" input of a respective. S-R register 712 and used to set the register output. Each S-R register 712 is reset by a respective reset signal, jh/sr_reset[x\9 provided to the "R" input of the register. The output of each register 712 and the reset signal for the register are respectively provided to a non-inverting input and an inverting input of a corresponding AND gate 713. The outputs from all AND gates 713a through 713t, which are indicative of "active" requests (i.e., requests that need to be processed) from all fingers and searchers, are provided to a priority encoder 714.<br><br>
[1076] Priority encoder 714 determines the processing order for the active requests based on a particular priority assignment scheme. In an embodiment, the priorities of the fingers and searchers are assigned as follows:<br>
fiiO_pnreq &gt; ... &gt;fiilIjjnreq &gt; S)-Qjmreq &gt; ... &gt; sr3jpnreq .<br>
Other priority assignment schemes for the fingers and searchers may also be implemented. Since the PN generator is able to process the requests from all fingers and searchers within an S-chip period, the particular priority assignment scheme selected for use may not be critical.<br>
[1077] Priority encoder 714 provides a control that indicates the specific finger or searcher whose request is to be processed next. This control is latched by a register 716 to provide difii/srjselect control. In an embodiment, the fii/srjselect control includes 16 bits (i.e., F + S bits), with one bit being assigned to each finger/searcher and used to indicate whether or not that finger/searcher has been selected for processing. The fii/srjselect control is a concatenation of a 12-bit fhjselect control and a 4-bit srjselect control (i.e., fii/sr_select = fixjselect &amp; srjselect). Only one bit of the fii/sr_jelect control is set at any given moment based on (1) the active requests pending at that moment and (2) the priority assignment scheme implemented by priority encoder 714. The active request to be processed next is referred to as the selected request. [1078] As noted above, each finger may request up to three PN vectors for each PN request, and each searcher may request a single PN vector for each PN request. A selector 732 receives fiiQjiwncode through jhll_nwncodef which are indicative of the number of PN vectors being requested by the 12 fingers. Selector 732 then selects the fnx_numcode from the finger whose request is being processed, as determined by the fii/sr_select control. The selected frxjiumcode is provided to the selector output and is denoted as numcode.<br>
[1079] A counter 720 is used to count through the number of PN vectors to be provided by the PN generator for the selected request. Counter 720 is enabled if any request is being processed, which may be indicated by performing an OR of all 16 bits of the fii/srjselect control using an OR gate 718. The output of counter 720, cat, is indicative of the number of PN vectors already provided for the selected request. The output of counter 720 is compared by a comparator 722 against the output of a multiplexer 724, which provides a value indicative of the number of PN vectors to be<br><br>
provided for the selected request. If the output of counter 720 is equal to the output of multiplexer 724, indicating that the last PN vector has been generated for the selected request, then comparator 722 provides a reset pulse on a cntj'eset signal. This reset pulse is used to reset counter 720 for the next selected request. The cntjreset signal is also ORed with the logic value, fii/sr__select = "00", by an OR gate 726, and the OR gate output is used to enable register 716. OR gate 726 is used to force register 716 to always be enabled whenever there are no PN requests.<br>
[1080] Multiplexer 724 provides "00", "Or, or "10" if one, two, or three PN vectors, respectively, are to be provided by the PN generator for the selected request. The 4 bits of the srjselect control are provided to the inputs of a NOR gate 728, The numcode from selector 732 and the NOR gate output are provided to the inputs of an AND gate 730, and the AND gate output is used to select one of the inputs of multiplexer 724. If the selected request is from a searcher, then the output of NOR gate 728 is logic low, the output of AND gate 730 is also logic low, and multiplexer 724 provides "00" to comparator 722. Otherwise, if the selected request is from a finger, then the output of NOR gate 728 is logic high, and the output of AND gate 730 is equal to numcode.<br>
[1081] Request arbitration unit 610a also generates various controls for other units of the PN generator and for the fingers and searchers. The fn/srjselect control and the cntjreset signal are provided to an AND gate 742 and used to generate the fn/sr_reset control for S-R registers 712.<br>
[1082] The fii/sr_select control and the cut from counter 720 are also used to provide the access controls for ROMs 630. An OR gate 744 provides a ROM chip select signal, romjcs, which is active logic high if any request is being processed. The ranijos signal is asserted for one clock cycle for each PN vector to be provided for the selected request. In particular, the romjcs signal is asserted for up to three (or numcode) clock cycles for each finger request and for one clock cycle for each searcher request.<br>
[1083] An AND gate 746a provides the enable control, mainjnjeih for the first PN vector for the main scrambling code. This control is activated when cnt = "00". An AND gate 746b provides the enable control, auxljpnjen* for the second PN vector for the first auxiliary scrambling code. This control is activated when cnt = "01". An AND gate 746c provides the enable control, aux2_p?i_en, for the third PN vector for the<br><br>
second auxiliary scrambling code. This control is activated when ait = "10". The 16-bit mainjpnjzn control includes one bit for each finger and searcher, the 12-bit axa\jpn_en control includes one bit for each finger, and the 12-bit aaxljpn_en control also includes one bit for each finger (since only one PN vector for the main scrambling code is provided for each searcher request).<br>
[10S4] An OR gate 748a performs an OR of all bits of the mainjmjzn control to provide a load control, mainj?njd, for the main scrambling code. An OR gate 74Sb performs an OR of ail 12 bits of the aiix\jm_en control to provide a load control, aivx,\_pnjd, for the first auxiliary scrambling code. And an OR gate 74Sc performs an OR of all 12 bits of the aial_pn_en control to provide a load control, anxljxijd, for the second auxiliary scrambling code. The load controls main_pnj,d, aialjpnjd, and aaxljpnjd are used to latch the PN vectors for the main, first auxiliary, and second auxiliary scrambling codes, respectively.<br>
[1085] A register 752 provides the load controls for the PN vectors generated for the fingers and searchers,fiiOjmJd through fnl\_pnjd and stO^pnJd through srjjmjd. These load signals are used to indicate that the PN vectors are ready for the selected request, and may be used by the fingers and searchers to load the PN vectors generated for these units.<br>
[1086] FIG. 8 is a block diagram of an embodiment of an address and control signal generator 620a, which is one embodiment of address and control signal generator 620 in FIG. 6. Generator 620a receives the phases for the PN vectors to be provided for the fingers and searchers, the code numbers for the main and auxiliary scrambling codes, and the controls indicative of whether or not the PSC is to be provided by the PN generator. Generator 620a then provides the addresses for the X_ROM and Y_ROM for each selected request.<br>
[1087] Within generator 620a, the PN vector phases for all fingers and searchers, fiiOJbaddr through fn\\J&gt;addr and srOJbaddr through srZJ&gt;addr, are provided to a selector 812, which also receives the fn/srjselect control. Selector 812 then provides the PN vector phase for the selected request, which is denoted as pnjjaddr. [108S] The main scrambling code numbers for all fingers and searchers, fiiOjnainjzodenwn through fixlXjnainjcodenum and sr0_main_codenwn through srZjnain_codenum, are provided to a selector 814, which also receives the main_pn_en control.  Selector 814 then provides the main scrambling code number for the selected<br><br>
request, which is denoted as inainjcodenitm. The first auxiliary scrambling code numbers for all fingers,fiiQjxuxljcodenum through fhll_ aiix\j:odenum, are provided to a selector 816, which also receives the auxlj?n_en control. Selector S16 then provides the first auxiliary scrambling code number for the selected request, if any, which is denoted as auxljcodemmu Similarly, the second auxiliary scrambling code numbers for all fingers, fiiQ_aia2_codenwn through fiill_jti(x2jcodenum9 are provided to a selector 818, which also receives the aux2_pnjen control. Selector SIS then provides the second auxiliary scrambling code number for the selected request, if any, which is denoted as aiixljcodenum.<br>
[1089] A multiplexer S20 receives the three code numbers main_codenum, aiixljcodenum, and aux2j:odenum from selectors 814, 816, and 818, respectively, selects one of the three code numbers based on a code_sel control, and provides the selected code number, which is denoted as codenum. The codejsel control may be obtained by concatenating the aux2_pnjd and aiixlj?n_ld (i.e., codesel = aux2_pnjd 8c auxljpnjd). A multiplexer 822 receives the most significant bits (MSBs) of codenum from multiplexer 820 (i.e., all but three LSBs of codenum) and the start address, pscjsaddr, of the PSC in the YJROM. Multiplexer 822 then selects one of the inputs based on the psc_sel control and provides the selected input as rom^offset. The rom_offset is indicative of either (1) the byte address offset for the X_ROM, which is determined by the scrambling code number, or (2) the byte address offset for the PSC in the Y.ROM.<br>
[1090] A multiplexer 824 receives the pnjbaddr from multiplexer 812 and the byte address of the PSC, pscjbaddr, selects one of the inputs based on the psc_sel control, and provides the selected input to an adder 826. Adder 826 also receives and adds romjjffset to the output from multiplexer 824 and provides pn/pscjbaddr. The pn/pscjbaddr is indicative of either (1) the byte address for the X_,ROM, if a PN vector is to be provided by the PN generator, or (2) the byte address for the YJROM, if the PSC is to be provided.<br>
[1091] For the specific ROM implementation shown in FIG. 5, an entire word is retrieved from each of the XI,ROM and X2JROM for each PN vector, with the specific word being dependent on whether the 1(0 vector needed for the PN vector is stored starting in the Xl_ROM or X2_ROM. The LSB of the pn/pscjbaddr is provided as an xjzddr_odd control, and all remaining bits of pn/psc_baddr are provided as the<br><br>
word address, x2_waddr, for the X2JROM, as shown in equations (5) and (10). This word address is also provided to one input of a multiplexer 830 and to an adder 832. Adder 832 adds a value of one ("1") to the word address and provides the result to the second input of multiplexer S30. If the x2_wadd_add control indicates that the byte address for the X.ROM is odd, then the value from adder 832 is provided as the word address, x1_wadder, for the Xl_ROM, as shown in equation (10). Otherwise, if the byte address for the X_ROM is even, then the x2jvaddr is provided as the word address for the X1JROM, as shown in equation (5).<br>
[1092] A multiplexer 82S receives the pnjbaddr from selector 812 and the pn/psc_baddr from adder 826. The multiplexer then provides either (1) pnjbaddr as the byte address, yjbaddr, for the Y„ROM if a PN vector is to be provided by the PN generator, or (2)pn/psc_baddrr as the byte address for the YJROM if a PSC vector is to be provided, as indicated by the psc_sel control.<br>
[1093] Bank of ROMs 630 in PN generator 610 may be implemented as shown in FIG. 5, which includes the XL.ROM, X2.ROM, and Y_ROM. For each PN vector to be provided by PN generator 610, address generator 620a provides the word addresses xljvaddr and x2_yvaddr for the Xl„ROM and X2_ROM, respectively, and the byte address yjbaddr for the Y_ROM. The necessary chip select and read enable signals are also provided for these ROMs, but are not described herein for simplicity. The X1JROM, X2JR.OM, and YJROM then provide three words, xljiata, xljiata, and yjiata, respectively, for each read cycle.<br>
[1094] FIG. 9 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a bit alignment and buffering unit 640a, which is one embodiment of bit alignment and buffering unit 640 in FIG. 6. For each PN vector to be provided by PN generator 610, unit 640a receives three words xljiata, xljiata, and yjiata from ROMs 630, shifts the xljiata and x2jiata by the proper number of bit positions to obtain the desired scrambling code, performs an XOR between the bytes of the yjiata with the corresponding bytes of the xljiata or xljiata, and provides the PN vectors. Each PN vector is a complex vector comprised of an inphase vector, pni_yec9 and a quadrature vector, pnqjvec, which are generated by I and Q vector generators 910a and 910b, respectively.<br>
[1095] Within I vector generator 910a, a multiplexer 912a receives (xl_data[\5:8] &amp; x2_data[l5:8]) on one input and (x2_data[15:8] &amp; xl_data[15:S)) on the other input. Multiplexer 912a then provides (xl_data[l5:] &amp; x2_data[15:$]) if the byte address for<br><br>
the X_ROM is even, as shown in equation (7), and (x2_data[l5:8] &amp; A-l_data[15:8]) if the byte address is odd, as shown in equation (11). The output of multiplexer 912a, xijvord* is one contiguous word regardless of the starting address of the desired X(i) vector in the X_ROM.<br>
[1096] A data alignment unit 914a receives and shifts the xijvord from multiplexer 912a by the number of bit positions indicated by the xjdatajsel, as shown in equation (9). In an embodiment, data alignment unit 914a is implemented with combinatory logic (instead of a shift register) to provide minimum and constant delay through the data alignment unit.<br>
[1097] Unit 914a then provides a data byte, xijiata, corresponding to the desired scrambling code number and PN phase. The xijiata is then XORed with the upper byte of Y-data by an XOR gate 916a to provide pnijiata. The xijiata corresponds to X(i-wi) in FIG. 4, the y_data[\5:$] corresponds to Y(i), the pnijiata corresponds to 1(f), and XOR gate 916a corresponds to modulo-2 adder 418. A register 920a receives and latches the pnijiata to provide aux2jmi_vecy if this I vector is for the second auxiliary scrambling code, as determined by the aux2jm_ld signal. Similarly, a register 922a receives and latches the pnijiata to provide mainj&gt;ni_vec, if this I vector is for the main scrambling code, as determined by the mainjpnjd signal.<br>
[1098] A multiplexer 918a receives y_data[\5:S], yjdata[7:Q], and pnijiata on three inputs. Multiplexer 918a then provides one of the inputs based on an outjel control, which may be generated by a concatenation of an inverted psc_sel and the LSB of pnjbaddr (i.e., out^sel = 'not pscjseV 8c pnj&gt;addr\0\). In particular, multiplexer 918a provides pnijiata if a PN vector is being provided for the first auxiliary scrambling code, yjlata[7:0] if the first byte of the PSC word is being provided for a PSC vector, and yjlata[l5:S] if the second byte of the PSC word is being provided. A register 924a receives and latches the output from multiplexer 918a to provide auxljpni_yec, if this I vector is for the first auxiliary scrambling code or the PSC, as determined by the auxljmjd signal.<br>
[1099]       Unit 910b is designed similar to unit 910a, but receives different inputs, as shown in FIG. 9. Unit 910b provides main_pnq_vec, aax\j)nqjecy and auxljmqjec for the main, first auxiliary, and second auxiliary scrambling codes, respectively. [1100]       In the specific implementation shown in FIG. 6, ROM-based PN generator 330a receives a number of parameters from the fingers and searchers and provides a set<br><br>
of one or more PN vectors for each finger and searcher. In an embodiment, to reduce the number of interface sisnals between the finders/searchers and the PN senerator a two-level arbitration scheme is implemented whereby the rake receiver performs the first level of arbitration and the PN generator performs the second level of arbitration. This design can greatly reduce the number of interface signals between the rake receiver and PN generator.<br>
[1101] FIG. 10 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a two-level arbitration scheme for ROM-based PN generation. In this embodiment, a rake receiver 254b includes 12 fingers 320 and 4 searchers 310. Each searcher 310 is associated with a corresponding PN generator interface unit 1010. and each finger 320 is associated with a corresponding PN generator interface unit 1020.<br>
[1102] Each PN generator interface unit locally maintains a PN count value for the associated finger/searcher. This PN count value is indicative of the phase of the PN vector to be used for descrambling. The PN count value may be maintained in chipxS resolution, in which case it may correspond to pn_cnt__xS shown in equation (1). [1103] For each finger, the PN count value may be derived based on the system reference count value, refjcnt, which is provided by the system timer and used as the reference timing by the entire receiver unit. The PN count value for each active finger may also be advanced or retarded (e.g., by 1/S PN chip resolution) based on changes in the arrival time of the multipath component being processed by that finger, as determined by a timing control loop maintained by that finger.<br>
[1104] For each searcher, the PN count value may be derived based on a local reference count value provided by a local counter. This allows each searcher to evaluate different hypotheses in the search for strong multipath components. The PN count value may be temporarily halted between hypotheses (e.g., to update different parameters, evaluate search results, and so on).<br>
[1105] The PN count value is reset to zero (or wraps around) at the end of the scrambling sequence, which is 38,400 chips for W-CDMA. Each PN generator interface unit may further include circuitry needed to slew the PN count value to a particular target value, if needed. The generation of the PN count value, the adjustment of this value to track the timing of the multipath component, and the slewing of the PN count value are all known in the art and not described herein.<br><br>
[1106] Each PN generator interface unit 1020 provides the PN request and the set of parameters for the associated finger/searcher. PN generator interface unit 1020 for each active finger and searcher may provide the respective set of parameters enumerated above. As the PN request for a particular finger/searcher is processed by ROM-based PN generator 330, the available PN vector(s) are received and latched by the associated PN generator interface unit 1020, as indicated by the mainjynjsn[x]7 auxl_pn_en[x], aux2_pn_en[x] signals. The PN vector(s) are then forwarded from the PN generator interface unit to the finger/searcher.<br>
[1107] An arbitration unit 1030a receives the PN requests and parameters from PN generator interface units 1020 for all fingers, selects one request for processing at any given moment, and provides the PN request and parameters for the selected finger to ROM-based PN generator 330. Similarly, an arbitration unit 1030b receives the PN requests and parameters from PN generator interface units 1010 for all searchers, selects one request for processing at any given moment, and provides the PN request and parameters for the selected searcher to ROM-based PN generator 330. PN generator 330 then arbitrates and processes the requests from arbitration units 1030a and 1030b. [1108] In another embodiment, the arbitration for all fingers and searchers is performed by an arbitration unit in the rake receiver. This arbitration unit would then provide the request and parameters for the selected finger/searcher. This embodiment can further reduce the number of interface signals between the rake receiver and PN generator.<br>
[1109] The ROM-based PN generator described herein can support multiple fingers and searchers simultaneously. As the number of the fingers and searchers grows, the ROM-based PN generator design can provide greater savings in die area and power in comparison to a design with one dedicated PN generator per finger/searcher. The ROM-based PN generator can also support both real-time and non-real-time receiver architectures, and can further support numerous finger and searcher architectures. The ROM-based PN generator can also provide PN vector at any desired PN phase, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming slewing operations, which are common performed by conventional PN generators. With the ROM-based PN generator, the fingers and searchers can simply calculate the PN phase (or ROM addresses) of the desired PN sequence, and the ROM-based PN generator can directly generate PN vector at this PN phase without the need for slewing operations.<br><br>
[1110] The ROM-based PN generator described herein may be used to provide PN vectors for various processing units (e.g., demodulation fingers and searchers). For some rake receiver designs, the multiple fingers are implemented by a single digital signal processor (DSP) that is operated in a time multiplexed manner. The same DSP or a different DSP may be used to implement the searchers. For a design in which the fingers and/or searchers are implemented in TDM manner, the ROM-based PN generator may be operated in the same TDM manner. In this way, the interface between the PN generator and the DSP(s) for the fingers and searchers may be simplified. [1111] The ROM-based PN generation techniques described herein may be used in various wireless communication systems. For example, these techniques may be use in CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, and other wireless communication systems. These systems may implement one or more applicable standards. For example, the CDMA systems may implement IS-95, IS-2000, IS-856, W-CDMA, and so on. The TDMA systems may implement GSM and so on. These various standards are known in the art. [1112] For clarity, a specific implementation is described herein whereby the PN sequences are stored in a bank of ROMs. In general, the PN sequences may be stored in one or more memory units that may be implemented with various memory technologies. For example, each memory unit may be implemented as a ROM, programmable ROM (PROM), electrically programmable ROM (EEPROM), random access memory (RAM), static RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), Flash, or some other memory type. Each PN sequence may be stored in a separate set of one or more memory units, as described above. Alternatively, all PN sequences may be stored in a single larger memory unit or in multiple memory units.<br>
[1113] The ROM-based PN generation techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, the elements used for PN generation may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, various elements used for PN generation may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, microcontrollers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof.  The memory unit(s) used to store the PN<br><br>
sequences may be implemented within or external to the processing unit(s) that implement the remaining portion of the PN generator.<br>
[1114] For a software implementation, various portions of the PN generation may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. For example, some or all of the functions performed by units 610, 620, and 640 in FIG. 6 may be implemented with software modules. The software codes may be stored in a memory unit (e.g., memory 262 in FIGS. 2 and 3) and executed by a processor (e.g., controller 260). This memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor, in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is known in the art. [1115] The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein.<br>
