				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention][0001][ Field of Industrial Utilization ] <br>
The present invention relates scooter with a foot brake, in which a main pipe connected to a head pipe runs in the longitudinal direction of the chassis under a foot panel on which the rider's feet are placed, a pedal arm which is linked and connected to a wheel brake under the foot panel extends up through said foot panel, and a foot-operable foot brake pedal is supported by the top end of the pedal arm.40002][Prior Art ]<br>
In conventional scooters, the rotating shaft of the foot brake pedal (brake shaft) was situated in the lateral direction of the chassis below the main pipe so as to avoid said pipe (see, for example, Japanese Utility Model Publication 63-38158}.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the absence of braking, the rider's feet were placed in a foot position on the foot panel between the pedal arm and the outer edge of the foot panel, and the foot brake pedal was roughly square shaped, with the top end of the pedal arm attached to the lateral center on the back surface (see, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Application 60-34089).<br>
[0004]<br>
[ Problems Which the Invention Is Intended to Solve ]<br>
Since the brake shaft passes underneath the main pipe so as to avoid said pipe in conventional vehicles, however, the vehicle floor components (such as the main pipe and foot panel) are high as a whole so as to ensure the minimum height<br>
of the vehicle above the ground, making the foot panel step height that much higher and cramping the heightwise foot space on the foot panel.<br>
[ 0005 ]<br>
Because the pedal arm is also relatively close to the side ends of the foot panel in conventional vehicles, the foot space on the foot panel is smaller in the widthwise direction of the vehicle. Furthermore, since the foot brake pedal is square shaped and is relatively large, the toes tend to catch on the pedal when the rider's foot is moved from the foot panel to the pedal side for braking.<br>
[ 0006 ]<br>
In view of the foregoing, an objective of the present invention is to provide a scooter with a foot brake that allows the aforementioned problems of the conventional structure to be resolved.<br>
[ 0007 ]<br>
[ Means Used to Solve the Above-Mentioned Problems ]<br>

[0009]<br>
In addition to the features of the inventions in the aforementioned claims, the invention in Claim 6 is characterized by the fact that the top (of the aforementioned pedal arm) protruding up from the foot panel is provided with a guide protrusion<br>
which guides the movement of the toes up from the foot panel onto the foot brake pedal.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a scooter with a foot brake, in which a main pipe connected to a head pipe H runs in the longitudinal direction of the chassis under a foot panel Ps on which the rider's feet are placed, and a foot-operable foot brake pedal BP is situated above the foot panel Ps,<br>

[ Preferred Embodiments of the Invention ]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to practical examples of the invention depicted in the attached drawings.<br>
[0011]<br>
In the attached drawings, Figure 1 is an overall side view schematically depicting a practical example of a scooter adapting the present invention. Figure 2 is a schematic plan of the aforementioned practical example (view along arrow 2 in Figure 1). Figure 3 is an enlarged cross section viewed along arrow 3-3 in Figure 2. Figure 4 is an enlarged plane viewed along arrow 4 in Figure 3. Figure 5 is an enlarged cross section viewed along arrow 5-5 in Figure 3. Figure 6 is an enlarged cross section viewed along arrow 6-6 in Figure 4.<br>
[0012]<br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the outer panel P of the scooter-type two-wheel vehicle V comprises: a foot panel Ps on which the rider's feet are placed; a front outer panel Pf that rises from the front of the foot panel Ps to cover the front wheel Wf from above; and a rear outer panel Pr that is connected to the outer end of the foot panel Ps and that covers the rear wheel-driving power unit 2 and the rear wheel Wr from above. A seat S is provided in an opening in the top of the rear outer panel Pr.  The back face of the front outer panel Pf swells out toward the rear so that the center part la corresponding to the main pipe 3 described below detours around said pipe 3, and the components Ib corresponding to the left and right leg shields are pulled forward. As shown in Figure 2, the front edge e of the foot panels Ps conforms to this rear face configuration, with the center portion pulled toward the back, and the parts corresponding to the left and right leg shields pulled forward. A foot brake pedal BP which can be operated by the rider's right foot is situated over the right half of the foot panel Ps.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
The metal chassis frame F supporting the aforementioned outer panel P integrally comprises: a head pipe H steerably supporting the front wheel Wf in the front outer panel Pf; one main pipe extending in the longitudinal direction of the chassis under the foot panel Ps and rising in front toward the head pipe H; and a pair of left and right rear frames 41, and 42 that are arranged in parallel to the left and right under the seat S, and whose front ends incline forward and downward so as to be integrally connected via a rear cross pipe 5 to the rear end of the main pipe 3. Between the left and right ends of the rear cross pipe 5 and the front ends of the pair of left and right rear frames 41, and 42, a pair of left and right brackets 221, and 222 which are intended to enhance the bonding strength between the above is welded so as to straddle the space therebetween. The front of the power unit 2 is swingably supported via a hanger 6 by the rear cross pipe 5, and a rear cushion 7 is mounted between the power unit 2 and the rear frames 41, and 42.<br>
[ 0014 ]<br>
A tubular shaft guide 8 made of a steel tube laterally extending through the main pipe 3 below the foot panel Ps is fixed by welding or the like to the main pipe 3, and the center of a front cross pipe 13 made of a steel tube that is longer than said pipe 3 and that is perpendicular to the main pipe 3 above it is fixed by welding or the like to a channel-shaped bracket 3b that is integrally mounted on said main pipe 3 above and before the shaft guide 8. A cross member 14 extending along the main pipe 3 integrally bridges the left end of the shaft guide 8 and the rear cross pipe 5. Rotatably supported by a spindle 17 on this cross member 14 is the center portion of a bell crank 16 to which the base end of the outer cable 12o of a first operating line 12 linked to the rear wheel brake (not shown in figure) and the base end of the outer cable 15o of a second operating line 15 linked to a parking brake lever (not shown in figure) located near the operating handle are fixed opposite each other, and to which the base end of the inner cable 15i of the second operating line 15 is connected at one end.  A return spring 18 energizing the inner<br>
cable 15i of the aforementioned second operating line 15 is linked to this bell crank 16.<br>
[0015]<br>
A brake shaft 9 that is longer than the aforementioned shaft guide 8 is rotatably fitted through and supported by the shaft guide 8. The drum of a return coil spring Sp is fitted to the right end of the brake shaft 9, and the base end of the pedal arm 10 to which the foot brake pedal BP is mounted at the tip is fixed by welding or the like. The return coil spring Sp is engaged at one end with said arm 10 and at the other end with the aforementioned cross pipe 13 so as to energize the pedal arm 10 to the return side (clockwise direction in Figure 3). The engagement parts are prevented from shifting to the side by a cisclip C engaged around the front cross pipe 13 and by a rubber stopper Sr described below. The part of the front cross pipe 13 corresponding to the pedal arm 10 resists the energizing force of the return coil spring Sb and can engage the pedal arm 10 so as to keep the arm 10 at the prescribed retraction limit (solid line position in Figure 3), and the tubular rubber stopper Sr for bufferably engaging said part is fitted under pressure therein.<br>
[0016]<br>
The base end of a relay lever 11 is fitted to the left end of the brake shaft 9, and the other end of the aforementioned bell crank 16 detachably faces the intermediate part of the lever 11. The base end of the relay lever 11 is formed into a crotch-shaped slot capable of tightening said shaft 9 by means of a bolt b in order to controllably attach the base end to the brake shaft 9 at a relative position around the axis, and serrations Se are provided on the surface where the lever 11 and the left end of the brake shaft 9 are engaged. The brake shaft 9 is prevented from sliding in the shaft guide 8 because the relay lever 11 fixed to the left end of the shaft 9 comes into contact with the left end of the shaft guide 8, while the cisclip C engaged around the left end of the shaft 9 comes into contact with the right end of the shaft guide 8.<br>
[0017]<br>
The base end of the inner cable 12i of the first operating line 12 linked to the rear wheel brake is linked to the tip of the relay lever 11.  Accordingly, when the foot brake pedal BP is stepped on while the vehicle is running, the operating force is transmitted through the brake shaft 9 from the pedal arm 10 on the right side to the relay lever 11 on the left side so as to rotate the lever 11 counterclockwise in Figure 3, thereby pulling the first operating line 12 forward so as to operate the rear wheel brake. When the parking brake lever (not shown in figure) is set while the vehicle is stopped, the bell crank 16 is rotated counterclockwise in Figure 4 via the second operating line 15 to engage it with the relay lever 11, thereby allowing the lever 11 to be similarly rotated counterclockwise in Figure 3 and the first operating line 12 to be pulled forward, so as to operate the rear wheel brake as a parking brake.<br>
[ 0018 ]<br>
The front ends of the pair of left and right metal stays 20, and 20, extending in the longitudinal direction of the chassis are supported outside of the brake shaft 9 by the left and right ends of the front cross pipe 13. Of these stays, the left side stay 20, is welded to the left end of the cross pipe 13, while the right side stay 20, is detachably linked by means of a threaded bolt 21 threaded through it to the right end of the cross pipe 13. The rear end of the left side stay 20, is welded to the aforementioned bracket 22, on the left side, while the rear end of the right side stay 20, is detachably linked by means of a bolt 23 to the right side bracket 22,. Various electrical accessories (battery Ba, fuse box HB, starter coil SC in the example in the figure) are housed in the floor space between the main pipe 3 and the right side stay 20, under the foot panel Ps.<br>
[0019]<br>
The stay 20, on the right side (that is, the foot brake pedal BP side) is detachable from the chassis frame F (specifically, the front cross pipe 13 right end and bracket 22,), so when the right side stay 202 is detached, it can be prevented<br>
from interfering when the internally housed brake shaft 9 and electrical accessories Ba, HB, SR, and the like are taken out or checked, thus facilitating assembly and maintenance operations.<br>
[ 0020]<br>
A total of four mounting bosses (front, back, left, and right) in contact with the upper surface of the pair of left and right stays 201, and 202, integrally protrude from the bottom surface of the foot panel Ps. The foot panel Ps is integrally supported on the two stays 201, and 202, by means of bolts 25 threaded through the bosses 24 into the stays 201, and 202.<br>
[ 0021 ]<br>
An opening 30 in a shape roughly corresponding to the tread f of the foot brake pedal BP is provided, so that the pedal BP can pass through, toward the front end of the right half of the foot panel Ps. The top 10a of the pedal arm 10 protrudes up through the opening 30 beyond the foot panel Ps. The foot position 31 on which the rider's right foot may be placed while the vehicle is running is provided on the foot panel Ps. As indicated by the imaginary line in Figure 4, the foot position 31 is established so that the outside edge is roughly aligned with the right side edge of the foot panel Ps and so that the toe component 3la falls between the top lOa of the pedal arm 10 and the right side edge of the foot panel Ps. The position in which the foot brake pedal BP is arranged with respect to the foot position 31 is displaced toward the center of the chassis (that is, the lateral center of the pedal BP is offset to the chassis center side with respect to the lateral center of the foot position 31).<br>
[ 0022 ]<br>
As shown in Figure 4 and 5, the top lOa (of the pedal arm 10) protruding up from the foot panel Ps is displaced toward the center of the chassis with respect to the tread f of the foot brake pedal BP (that is, the lateral center of the top lOa is offset to the chassis center side with respect to the lateral center of the tread  f). The top end of the arm 10 is also fixed to the foot brake pedal BP at a position displacedtoward the chassis center with respect to the tread f. .The corner of the tread f of the foot brake pedal BP corresponding to the toe component 3la of the aforementioned foot position 31 is cut 32 diagonally.  In the example in the figure, the overall shape is formed roughly in the shape of a right-angled triangle, with the slanted side to the outside rear.<br>
[ 0023 ]<br>
A guide protrusion 10g for guiding the movement of the toe up from the foot panel Ps onto the foot brake pedal BP is integrally formed on the rear end edge of the top 10a (of the pedal arm 10) protruding up from the foot panel Ps. The guide protrusion lOg is formed in a hill shape near the bottom end edge of the pedal BP, when viewed from the side in the example in the figure, so that the top rear end edge of the pedal arm 10 and the bottom end edge of the foot brake pedal BP are connected in an extremely smooth manner, with no pronounced difference in levels between these parts.<br>
[ 0024 ]<br>
The action of the aforementioned practical example is described below. During braking, the pedal arm 10 is held by the energizing force of the return coil spring Sp at the retraction limit (solid line position in Figure 3) in contact with the rubber stopper Sr on the front cross pipe 13, and the rider's right foot is placed on the aforementioned foot position 31 roughly along the right side edge of the foot panel Sp. When the foot brake is operated from this state, the right foot should be moved onto the foot brake pedal BP to push it down, so that the operating force is transmitted from said pedal BP through the pedal arm 10, brake shaft 9, relay arm 11, and operating line 12 to the reafwheel brake, allowing the brake to be operated.<br>
[ 0025 ]<br>
In this case, the guide protrusion lOg located on the rear end edge of the top lOa of the pedal arm 10 can guide the movement of the toes up from the foot panel Ps onto the foot brake pedal BP, so the toes are effectively prevented from<br>
catching on the pedal BP, thus facilitating the opcrability of the foot brake.  The top 10a (of the pedal arm 10) protruding up from the foot panel Ps is displaced toward the chassis center with respect to the tread f of the foot brake pedal BP and is at a considerable distance from the right side edge of the foot panel Ps, making it possible to ensure a considerably wide foot position 31 on the foot panel Ps so as to allow the toe component 3la to fall between the top lOa and the right side edge of the foot panel Ps, and consequently to ensure considerably wide foot space in the . widthwise direction of the vehicle. Because, moreover, the tread f of the pedal BP is cut 32 diagonally at the component where the toes are at rest, the toes can be effectively prevented from catching on the pedal BP during braking.<br>
[ 0026 ]<br>
Because, in particular, the structure is such that the brake shaft 9 passes laterally through the main pipe 3, the vehicle floor components do not need to be made especially high for the brake shaft 9, and it is possible to ensure adequately high foot space on the foot panel Ps. Because adequately high and wide foot space can thus be ensured on the foot panel Ps, the foot brake can be positioned without forming the foot panel Ps with a special width and without diminishing the vertical or lateral foot space.<br>
[ 0027 ]<br>
Furthermore, the shaft guide 8 into which the brake shaft 9 is fitted and supported extends laterally at some length through the main pipe 3, so sufficiently high support rigidity for the brake shaft 9 can be ensured, and the shaft 9 can be rotated smoothly with no problems.  Despite the length of the shaft guide 8 and the brake shaft 9, they are widely encompassed in front by the front cross pipe 13, on the left and right outsides by the left and right stays 201, and 202, and in back by the rear cross pipe 5, allowing the guide 8 and shaft 9 to be effectively protected against collisions and the like with other materials.<br>
[ 0028 ]<br>
The present invention was described with reference to the practical examples above, but the present invention is not limited to these practical examples. Many practical examples are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, the aforementioned practical examples were of a scooter-type vehicle, but the present invention may also be realized with a scooter-type three-wheel vehicle. In the practical examples above, only the stay 202 on the brake side was detachable from the chassis frame F, but both stays 201, and 202 can be detachable in the present invention.<br>
[ 0029 ]<br>
[ Merits of the Invention ]<br>
As described above, in the inventions in Claims 1 through 3, 5 and 6, the brake shaft passed laterally through the main pipe under the foot panel, so the vehicle floor components did not have to be made especially high for the brake shaft, and it was thus possible to ensure adequately high foot space on the foot panel when designing the foot brake.<br>
[ 0030 ]<br>
In the invention in Claim 2, in particular, even though the shaft guide passing through the main pipe was made long to enhance the support rigidity for the brake shaft and to ensure smooth rotation, the shaft guide and brake shaft can be widely encompassed in front by the cross pipe and on the left and right outsides by the left and right stays, so the guide and shaft can be effectively protected against collisions or the like with other materials, enhancing the durability as a whole.<br>
[0031 ]<br>
In the invention in Claim 3, the stay on the foot brake pedal side is detachable, so the stay can be prevented from interfering when the brake shaft is detached or checked, thereby further enhancing the foot brake assembly and maintenance.<br>
[ 0032 ]<br>
In the invention in Claim 4, the top of the pedal arm protruding up from the foot panel is displaced toward the chassis center with respect to the tread of the foot brake pedal, allowing it to remain a considerable distance from the side of the foot panel, so adequately wide foot space on the foot panel in the widthwise direction of the vehicle can be ensured. Moreover, the pedal tread is cut diagonally at the component where the toes are at rest, allowing the rider's toes to be effectively prevented from catching on the pedal during braking.<br>
[ 0033 ]<br>
In the invention in Claim 5, adequately high and wide foot space in the widthwise direction of the vehicle on the foot panel can be ensured, so the foot brake can be readily positioned without forming a specially wide foot panel and without diminishing the vertical and lateral foot space, and the rider's toes can be prevented from catching on the pedal during braking.<br>
[ 0034 ]<br>
In the invention in Claim 6, the guiding action provided by the guide protrusion on the top of the pedal arm protruding up form the foot panel allows the toes to move up smoothly from the foot panel onto the foot brake pedal, further enhancing the foot brake operability.<br>
