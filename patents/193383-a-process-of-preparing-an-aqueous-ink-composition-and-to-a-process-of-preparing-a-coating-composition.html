This invention relates to a process of preparing an aqueous ink composition and to a process of preparing a coating composition which contain a modified carbon product.<br>
There are various classifications of inks used presently. These categories include printing inks, ultraviolet cure inks, ball-point inks, and stamp pad or marking inks. Fundamentally, inks may be composed of four major material categories. They are colorants, vehicles or varnishes, additives and solvents.<br>
In more detail, colorants, which include pigments, toners and dyes, provide the color contrast with the substrate. Vehicles or varnishes act as carriers for the colorants during the printing operation. Upon drying, the vehicles bind the colorants to the substrate. Additives influence the printability, film characteristics, drying speed, and end-use properties. Finally, solvents, besides participating in formation of the vehicles, are used to reduce ink viscosity and adjust drying ease and resin capability. Generally, ingredients from these four classes are<br><br>
A-eighed, mixed, and ground (i.e., dispersed) togecher, or separately, according to desired formulas.<br>
Presently, predominant black piigments are carbon blacks such as furnace blacks which are used as the colorants either in dry, powdered form, a flushed paste, or liquid concentrate form.  The flush paste and liquid concentrate forms are more economical since they require a minimum of dispersing effort.  Generally, the form of nhe colorant influences the hue, permanency, bulk, opacity, gloss, rheology, end use, and print quality.<br>
Generally, inks can be applied by letter press, lithographic, flexographic, gravure, silk screen, stencil, duplicating, and electrostatic.  Inks thus can be found in such end uses as news, publication, commercial, folding carton, book, corrugated box, paper bag, wrapper, label, metal container, plastic container, plastic film, foil, laminating, food insert, sanitary paper, textile and the like.  McGraw-Hill's Encyclopedia   of  Science   and Technology,   Vol. 7, pgs. 159-164, provides further details of the types of inks available and their uses, all of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Even with the inks commercially available, there is still a need to provide inks which may be more readily prepared.<br>
Coatings are used for decorative, procective, and functional treatments of many kinds of surfaces.  These surfaces include, coils, metals, appliances, furniture, hardboard, lumber and plywood, marine, maintenance, aucombbile, cant;, and papeiboard. Some coatings, such as those on undersea pipelines, are for<br><br>
protective purposes.  others, such as exterior automobile coatings, fulfill both decorative and protective functions.  Still others provide friction control on ;boat decks or car seats.- .Some' coatings control the fouling of ship bottoms, others protect food and beverages in cans.  Silicon chips, printed circuit panels, coatings on waveguide fibers for signal transmission, and magnetic coatings on video tapes and computer disks are among many so-called hi-tech applications for coatings.<br>
Each year, tens of thousands of coating types are manufactured.  In general, they are composed of one or more binders, for example resins or polymers, and at least one solvent, one or more pigments, and optionally several additives.  Most coatings are manufactured and applied as liquids and are converted to "solid" films after application to the substrate.<br>
Pigments and coatings provide opacity and color.  Pigment content governs the gloss of the final film and can have important effects on rts mechanical properties.  Some pigments even inhibit corrosion.  Further, pigments affect the viscosity and enhance the application properties of the coating.  An important variable w-termining the properties of pigments is their particle size and particle-size distribution.  Pigment manufacturing processes are designed to afford the particle size and particle-size distribution that provide the best compromise of particles for that pigment.  In manufacturing coatings, it is desirable to disperse Lhe pigiueiiL in such a. way as to achieve a stable dispersion where most, if not all, of the pigment particles are<br><br>
separated into the individual partieles designed into the product by the pigment manufacturer.  The dispersion of pigment involves wetting, separation, and stabilization.<br>
There are three categories of vehicles:  those in which the binder is soluble in water, those in which it is colloidally dispersed, and those in which it is emulsified to form a latex. Surface coating compositions are usually more or less viscous liquids with three based components:  a film-forming substance or combination of substances called the binder, a pigment or coir±)ination of pigments, and a volatile liquid.  The combination of binder and volatile liquid is called the vehicle which may be a solution or a dispersion of fine binder particles in a r.on-solvent .  Pigments are finely divided, insoluble, solid particles dispersed in the coating vehicle and distributed throughout the binder in the final film.  Surfactants are used as pigment dispersants.  The components and manufacturing of aqueous coatings are further discussed in the Concised  Encyclopedia   of Polymers,    Science  and Engineering-,   pgs. 160-171 (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
There is still a need for a; ■ aqueous coating that may be more readily prepared in both aqueous inks and coatings.  The solvent is, or contains, water.<br><br>
StJMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invexition relates to an aqueous ink composition or aqueous coating composition comprising water and a modified carbon product comprising' a carbon having attached an organic group.  The organic group is substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group.  Carbon, as used herein, is capable of reacting with a diazonium salt to form the above-mentioned modified carbon product.

The aqueous inks and coatings of this invention offer desirable dispersion stability, print quality, and image optical density.<br><br>
The description which follows sets out additional features and advantages of the invention.  These functions will be apparent from that description or may be learned by practice of the invention as described.  The objectives and other advantages will be realized and attained by the processes, products, and compositions particularly pointed out in the description below and the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Carbon, as used herein, is capable of reacting with a diazonium salt to form the above-mentioned modified carbon product.  The carbon may be of the crystalline or amorphous type. Examples include, but are not limited to, graphite, carbon black, vitreous carbon, activated charcoal, activated carbon, and -p.ixtures thereof.  Finely divided forms of t'-e above are preferred.<br>
The present invention relates to aqijeous ink and coating compositions comprising an aqueous vehicle and the modified carbon product.  In contrast to conventional carbon pigments; the modified carbon products for use in the ink or coating of the present invention are not difficult to disperse in an aqueous vehicle.  The modified carbon products do not necessarily require a conventional milling process, nor are dispersants necessarily needed to attain a usable ink or coating.  Preferably, the I   modified carbon products only require low shear stirring or mixing to readily disperse the pigment in water.<br><br>
The carbon products may be prepared by reacting carbon as defined above, with a diazonium salt in a licjuid reaction medium to attach at least one organic grotip to the surface of the carbon. Preferred reaction media include water, any medium containing water, and any medium containing alcohol.  Water is the most preferred medium.  These modified carbon products, wherein the carbon is carbon black, and various methods for their preparation are described in U.S. patent application 08/356,660 entitled "Reaction of Carbon Black with Diazonium Salts, Resultant Carbon Black Products and Their Uses," filed December 15, 1994, and its continuation-in-part application, filed concurrently with this application, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. These modified carbon products, wherein the carbon is not carbon black, and various methods for their preparation are described in patent application serial number 08/356,653 entitled "Reaction of Carbon Materials With Diazonium Salts and Resultant Carbon Products," filed December 15, 1994, also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
To prepare the above modified carbon products, the diazonium salt need only be sufficieVitly stable to allow reaction with the carbon.  Thus, that reaction can be carried out with some diazonium salts otherwise considered to be unstable and subject to decomposition.  Some decomposition processes may compete with the reaction between the carbon and the diazonium salt and may reduce the total number of organic groups attached to the carbon. Further, the reaction may be carried out at elevated temperatures<br><br>
where many-di.azonium salts may be susceptible to decomposition. Elevated temperatures.may also advantageously increase the solubility of the diazonium salt in the reaction medium and improve its' handling during the process.  However, elevated temperatures may result in some loss of the diazonium salt due to other decomposition processes.<br>
Carbon black can be reacted with a diazonium salt when present as a dilute, easily stirred, aqueous slurry, or in the presence of the proper amount of water for carbon black pellet formation.  If desired, carbon black pellets may be formed utilizing a conventional pelletizing technology.  Other carbon can be similarly reacted with the diazonium salt.  In addition, when modified carbon products utilizing carbon other than carbon black for used in aqueous inks and coatings are used, the carbon should preferably be ground to a fine particle size before reaction with the diazonium salt to prevent unwanted precipitation in the ink. The organic groups which may be attached to the carbon are organic" groups substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group as a functional group.  An ionizable group is one which is capable of forming an ionic group in the medium of use.  The ionic -/roup may be an anionic group or a cationic group and the ionizable group may form an anion or a cation.<br>
Ionizable functional groups forming anions include, for example, acidic groups or salts of acidic groups.  The organic groups, therefore. Include groups derived from orgcinic acids. Preferably, when it contains an ionizable group forming an anion.<br><br>
such an organic group has a) an aromatic group or a ^-^-€-^2 substituted or unsubstituted alkyl^ group and b) at least one acidic group having a pKa of less than 11, or at least one salt of an acidic group having a pKa of less than 11, or a mixture of at least one acidic group having a pKa of less than 11 and at least one salt of an acidic group having a pKa of less than 11.  The pKa of the acidic group refers to the pKa of the organic group as a whole, not just the acidic substituent.  More preferably, the pKa is less than 10 and most preferably less than 9.  Preferably, the aromatic group or the alkyl group of the organic group is directly attached to the carbon.  The aromatic group may be further substituted or unsubstituted, for example, with alkyl groups.  The C-j_-C-j^2 alkyl group may be branched or unbranched and is preferably ethyl.  More preferably, the organic group is a phenyl or a naphthyl group and the acidic group ^s a sulfonic acid group, a sulfinic acid group, a phosphonic acid group, or a carboxylic acid group.  Excimples include -COOH, -SO3H and -PO3H2, -SO2NH2 , -SO2NHCOR, and their salts, for example -COONa, -COOK, -COO~NR^"^, -S03Na, -KPOjNa, -S03~NR4'*', and PO-jNa2, where R is an alkyl or phenyl group.  Particularly preferred ionizable substituents are -COOH and -SO3H and their sodium and potassium salts.<br>
Most preferably, the organic group is a substituted or unsubstituted sulfophenyl group or a salt thereof; a substituted or unsubstituted (polysulfo)phenyl group or a salt thereof; a substituted or unsubstituted suitoriaphthyi group or a salt thereof; or a substituted or unsubstituted (polysulfo)naphthyl<br><br>
group or a salt thereof.  A preferred substituted sulfophenyl group is hydroxysulfophenyl group or a salt thereof.<br>
Specific organic groups havingran ionizable functional group forming an anion are p-s-ulf ophenyl, ' 4-hydroxy-3-sulfophenyl, and 2-sulfoethyl.<br>
Amines represent examples of ipnizable functional groups that form cationic groups and can be attached to the same organic groups as discussed above for the ionizable groups which form anions.  For example, amines may be protonated to form ammonium groups in acidic media.  Preferably, an organic group having an amine substituent has a pKb of less than 5.  Quaternary ammonium groups (-NR-j"*") and quaternary phosphonium groups (-PR^"^) also represent examples of cationic groups and can be attached to the same organic groups as discussed above for the ionizable groups which form anions.  Preferably, the organic group contains an aromatic group such as a phenyl or a naphthyl group and a quaternary ammonium or a quaternary phosphonium group.  The aromatic group is preferably directly attached to the carbon. Quaternized cyclic amines, and quaternized aromatic amines, can also be used as t;-- organic group.  Thus, N-substituted pyridiniu.Ti compounds, such as N-methyl-pyridyl, can be used in this regard. Sxcimples of organic groups include, but are not limited to, (C5H4N)C2H5*, CgH^ (NC5H5 ) ^ , C5H4COCH2N (CH3 ) 3""", CgH4COCK2 (NC5H5 ) " , {C5H4N)CH3'^, and CgH4CH2N (CH3 ) 3"^ .<br>
Aii advaiitage of the modified carbon products having an attached organic group substituted with an ionic or an ionizable<br><br>
group is that the modified carbon products may have increased water dispersibility relative to the corresponding untreated carbon.  In general, water dispersibility of the modified carbon products increases with the number of organic groups attached to the carbon having an ionizable group or the number of ionizable groups attached to a given organic group.  Thus, increasing the number of ionizable groups associated with the modified carbon products should increase their water dispersibility and permits control of the water dispersibility to a desired level.  It can be noted that the water dispersibility of modified carbon products containing an amine as the organic group at^tached to the carbon may be increased by acidifying the aqueous vehicle.<br>
Because the water dispersibility of the modified carbon products depends to some extent on charge stabilization, it is preferable that the ionic strength of the aqueous medium  be less than 0.1 molar.  More preferably, the ionic strength is less than 0.01 molar.  It is preferred that the modified carbon product of the present invention contain no by-prodilcts or salts.<br>
When water dispersible modified carbon products of the present invention are prepared, it is preferred t'-.at the ionic or ionizable groups be ionized in the reaction medium.  The resulting product dispersion or slurry may be used as is or diluted prior to use.  Alternatively, the modified carbon products may be dried by techniques used for conventional carbon blacks.  These techniques include, but are not limited to, drying in ovens and rotary kilns. Overdrying, however, may cause a loss in the degree of water<br><br>
dispersibility.  in the event that the modified carbon products above do not disperse in the aqueous vehicle as readily as desired, the modified carbon products may be dispersed using conventionally known techniques such as milling or grinding.<br>
The modified carbon black products of this invention are particularly useful in aqueous ink formulations.  Thus, the invention provides an improved ink composition comprising water and a modified carbon product according to the invention.  Other known aqueous ink additives may be incorporated into the aqueous ink formulation.<br>
In general, an ink may consist of four basic components: (1) a colorant or pigment, (2) a vehicle or varnish which functions as a carrier during printing, (3) additives to improve printability drying, and the like, and (4) solvents to adjust viscosity, drying and the compatibility of the other ink components.  For a general discussion on the properties, preparation and uses of aqueous inks, see The  Printing Manual,   5th Ed., Leach et al, Eds. {Chapman and Hall, 1993), incorporated herein by references.  Various aqueous ink compositions are also disclosed, for example, in United States Patents Nos. 2,833,736, 3,607,813, 4,104,833, 4,308,061, 4,770,706, and 5,026,755, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The modified carbon products of the invention, either as predispersion or as a solid, can be incorporated into an aqueous ink formulation using standard techniques.  Use of a water dispersible modified carbon product of the invention provides a<br><br>
significant advantage and cost savings by reducing or eliminating the milling steps generally used with other conventional carbon blacks.<br>
Flexographic inks represent a group of aqueous ink compositions.  Flexographic inks generally include a colorant, a binder, and a solvent.  The modified carbon products of the invention are useful as flexographic ink colorants.  Example 3 shows the use of a modified carbon product of the invention in an aqueous flexographic ink formulation.<br>
The modified carbon products of the invention can be used in aqueous news inks.  For example, an aqueous news ink composition may comprise water, the modified carbon products of the invention, a resin and conventional additives such as antifoam additives or a surfactant.<br>
The modified carbon products of this invention may also be used in aqueous coating compositions such as paints or finishes. Thus, an embodiment of the invention is an improved aqueous coating composition comprising water, resin and a modified carbon product according to the invention.  Other known aqueous coating additives may be incorporated the aqueous coating composition. See, for example, McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology, 5th Ed.  (McGraw-Hill, 1982), incorporated herein by reference.  See also United States Patents Nos. 5,051,464, 5,319,044, 5,204,404, 5,051,464, 4,692,481, 5,356,973, 5,314,945, 5,266,406, and 5,266,361, all incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The modified carbon products of the invention, either as a predispersion or as a solid, can be incorporated into an aqueous coating composition using standard techniques.  Use of a water dispersible modified carbon product provides a significant advantage and cost savings by reducing or eliminating the milling steps generally used with other conventional carbon blacks.  Some of the Excunples below show the use of modified carbon products according to the invention in aqueous automotive topcoat formulations.<br>
An aqueous ink or coating containing an aqueous vehicle and stably dispersed modified carbon product as pigment can be formed with a minimum of components and processing steps when the above carbon products are utilized.  Such an ink or coating may be used for a variety of uses.  Preferably, in aqueous inks and coatings of the present invention, the modified carbon products are present in an amount of less than or equal to 20% by weight of the ink or coating.  It is also within the bounds of the present invention to use an aqueous ink or coating formulation containing h  mixture of unmodified carbon with the modified carbon products of the present invention.  Common additives such as those discussed below may be added to the dispersion to further improve the properties of the aqueous ink or coating.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process of preparing an aqueous ink composition comprising water and a modified carbon product such as herein described having at least one organic group attached to the carbon wherein the organic group is substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process of preparing an aqueous coating composition comprising water, a binder, and a modified carbon product such as herein described having at least one organic group attached to carbon wherein the organic group is substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group.<br>

Volatile content was determined as follows.  A carbon black sample was dried to constant weight iat 125 C.  A 45 mL sample of the dry carbon black was placed in a covered 50 mL crucible that had been dried at 950°C and heated in a muffle furnace for 7 minutes at 950 C.  The volatile content is expressed as the percentage of weight lost by the carbon sample.<br>
The following procedure was used in various Examples below to determine the aqueous residue of carbon black products according to this invention and untreated carbon blacks.  The carbon black product (5 g) was shaken with 45 g of water for 5 minutes.  The resulting dispersion was poured through a screen and rinsed with water until the washings were colorless.  A 325 mesh screen was used unless indicated otherwise.  After drying the screen, the weight of residue on the screen was determined and expressed as a percentage of the carbon black product used in the test.<br>
Exeunple 1<br>
Preparation o£ a carbon black product<br>
with a praformad diazonium salt in a pin pelletizer<br>
This example shows another method for the preparation of a carbon black product of the present invention.  A pin pelletizer<br><br>
was charged with 400 g of a fluffy carbon black  With a surface<br>
2<br>
area of 80 m /g and a DBPA of 85 ml/100 g.  A cold suspension of<br>
4-sulfobenzenediazonium hydroxide inner salt prepared from 27.1 g of the sodium salt of sulfanilic acid, 10.32 g of sodium nitrite, 29.0 g of concentrated HCl and 293.5 g of water and was added to the pelletizer.  After pelletizing for 2 minutes, the sample was removed and dried at 115°C to constant weight.  The product had a 325 mesh residue of 0.1%, compared to 81% for the unreacted carbon black.  Soxhlet extraction with ethanol overnight gave a carbon black product containing 1.1% sulfur, compared against 0.8% for the untreated carbon black.  This shows that 27% of the p-CgH^SOo" groups were attached to the carbon black product.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.09 mmol/g of attached p-CgH^S03~ groups.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation o£ a carbon black product<br>
with a diazoniiun salt generated in situ<br>
This example illustrates another method for the preparation of a caibon black product of the present invention.  A fluffy carbon black  with a surface area of 560 m /g, a DBPA of 90 ml/100 g and a volatile content of 9.5% was used.  Fifty grams of the fluffy carbon black were added to a solution of 8.83 g of sulfanilic acid dissolved in 420 g of water.  The resulting suspension was cooled to 30°C and 4.6 g of concentrated nitric acid was added.   An aqueous solution  containing 3.51 g of sodium<br><br>
, nitrite was then added gradually with stirring, forming 4-sulfobenzenediazonium hydroxide ihr^er.salt in  situ,   which reacts with the fluffy carbon black.   Thd resulting product was dried in an oven at 125oC, leaving the carbon black product.   The product had a 325 mesh residue of 0.1%, compared to 6% for the unreacted carbon black.  The carbon black product contained 1.97% sulfur after Soxhlet extraction with ethanol overnight, compared to 0.24% sulfur for the untreated fluffy carbon black.   This corresponds to attaching 53% of the p-CgH4S03~  groups to the carbon black product.  Therefore, the carbon black product had 0.54 mmol/g of attached p-CgH^SO-^"  groups.<br>
