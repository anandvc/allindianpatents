CONTROLLED RELEASE COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a controlled release composition of a physiologically active substance, a method of producing the same, and a use as a medicine and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Biodegradable polymers having controlled releasing property are useful, for example, as base materials of microcapsules and the like for containing a physiologically active substance. It is known that, as such biodegradable polymers, polymers containing polylactic acid, a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid, and the like are useful (JP-A No. 11-269094 and the like).<br>
As these biodegradable polymers, those produced by a conventional synthesis method have been used themselves, however, it has been found that those produced themselves have poor availability as a controlled release base material since they have low content of end carboxyl groups. Therefore, it has been studied to hydrolyze an biodegradable polymer as described above having higher<br>
molecular weight to control the weight-average molecular weight thereof to suitable level, before use as a base material for a controlled release preparation.<br>
However, polymers obtained by hydrolysis and water-washing tend to cause an initial burst of physiologically active substance, rendering them unsuitable as a controlled release base material, even if they have an appropriate weight-average molecular weight and end carboxyl group content. Therefore, an improvement is desired in current conditions.<br>
JP-A No. 7-97334 discloses a controlled release preparation composed of a physiologically active peptide or salt thereof and an biodegradable polymer having a free carboxyl group at the end, and a method of producing the same.<br>
GB2209937, GB2234169, GB2234896, GB2257909 and EP626170A2 disclose a composition containing as a base material a biodegradable polymer containing a water-insoluble salt such as pamoates of peptide and protein prepared separately, and a method of producing this composition.<br>
WO95/15767 discloses an embonate (pamoate) of cetrorelix (LH-RH-antagonist) and a method of producing the same, and simultaneously describes that even if this pamoate is enclosed in an biodegradable polymer, the<br>
peptide releasing property thereof is the same as for a pamoate alone.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel composition containing a physiologically active substance in high content and capable of achieving a stable releasing speed for a long period of time by suppressing the initial excess release of pharmaceutically active substance, and a method of producing the same.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have intensively investigated in view of the above-mentioned conditions, and ultimately succeeded in producing a lactic acid polymer or salt thereof not readily causing the initial excess release, by reducing the content of a lactic acid polymer of lower molecular weight, particularly, that having a weight-average molecular weight of 5000 or less in an biodegradable polymer, and found that a controlled release preparation containing this lactic acid polymer or salt thereof can incorporate a physiologically active substance in unexpectedly high content and that a stable releasing speed for a long period of time can be achieved by suppressing the initial excess release.<br>
Further, the present inventors have found that if a physiologically active substance is incorporated in high content in a composition by allowing a physiologically active substance and hydroxynaphthoic acid to coexist in forming the composition and further both of them are enclosed in a lactic acid polymer or salt thereof, then, the physiologically active substance is released at a different speed from the releasing speed of a physiologically active substance from a composition formed of a physiologically active substance and hydroxynaphthoic acid prepared in the absence of a lactic acid polymer or salt thereof, and the releasing speed can be controlled by the property of the biodegradable polymer and the addition amount of hydroxynaphthoic acid, and even at high content, the initial excess release can be suppressed effectively and sustained release for a very long period of time can be achieved.<br>

When other amino acids are represented by abbreviations, they are based on abbreviations according to IUPAC-IUB Commission of Biochemical Nomenclature (European Journal of Biochemistry), vol. 138, pp. 9 to 37 (1984) and conventional abbreviations in the art, and when amino acids have optical isomers, they are in the form of L-amino acid unless otherwise stated.<br>
The hydroxynaphthoic acid used in the present<br>
invention is prepared by bonding one hydroxyl group and one carboxyl group to different carbons in naphthalene. Therefore, 14 isomers in total are present in which the position of a hydroxyl group varies for carboxyl groups situated at 1-position and 2-position of a naphthalene ring. Any isomer among them may be used, and a mixture of them at any ratio may also be used. As described later, those having larger acid dissociation constants are preferable, or those having small pKa' s (pKa = — log10Ka, Ka represent acid dissociation constant) are preferable. Those having slight water-solubility are preferable.<br>
Further, those soluble in alcohols (for example, ethanol, methanol and the like) are preferable. The term "soluble in alcohols" means that solubility in methanol is 10 g/L or more.<br>
As the pKa of the above-mentioned hydroxynaphthoic acid isomer, the value of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (pKa = 2.708, Chemical Handbook, Basic II, The Chemical Society of Japan, published on September 25, 1969) is only known, however, useful knowledge is obtained by comparing pKas of three kinds of isomers of hydroxybenzoic acid. Namely, pKas of m-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid are 4 or more, while, pKa of o-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid) is extremely small (= 2.754). Therefore, among the above-mentioned 14 isomers, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 1-<br>
hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid and 2-hydroxy-l-naphthoic acid in which a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group are bonded to adjacent carbon atoms in a naphthalene ring are preferable. Further, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid in which a hydroxyl group is bonded to carbon at 3-position in naphthalene and a carboxyl group is bonded to carbon at 2-position is suitable.<br>
The hydroxynaphthoic acid may be a salt.

and dried.<br>

The lactic acid polymer of the present invention<br>
obtained as described above is suitable as a base material for a controlled release composition since the amount of end carboxyl groups is in the range suitable for a base material for a controlled release composition.<br>
The weight ratio of a physiologically active substance in the composition of the present invention differs depending on the kind of a physiologically active substance, desired pharmaceutical effect and duration period of an effect and the like, and in the case of a physiologically active peptide or salt thereof, is from about 0.001 to about 50% by weight, preferably from about 0.02 to about 40% by weight, more preferably about 0.1 to about 30% by weight, further preferably from about 0.1 to about 24% by weight, most preferably from about 3 to about 24% by weight, and in the case of a non-peptide physiologically active substance or salt thereof, from about 0.01 to about 80% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight, based on the whole composition.<br>
The weight ratio of a physiologically active substance in the composition of the present invention containing hydroxynaphthoic acid or salt thereof varies depending on the kind of physiologically active substance, desired pharmaceutical effect and duration period of the effect and the like, and in the case of a controlled release composition containing a physiologically active substance<br>
or salt thereof, hydroxynaphthoic acid or salt thereof and lactic acid polymer or salt thereof, the weight ratio is, in the case of a physiologically active peptide or salt thereof, from about 0.001 to about 50% by weight, preferably from about 0.02 to about 40% by weight, more preferably about 0.1 to about 30% by weight, most preferably from about 14 to about 24% by weight, and in the case of a non-peptide physiologically active substance or salt thereof, from about 0.01 to about 80% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight, based on the sum of three components.<br>
Even if a hydroxynaphthoate which is a physiologically active substance is contained, the same weight ratio is applied. In the case of a controlled release composition containing a salt of a physiologically active peptide (temporarily called (A) ) and hydroxynaphthoic acid (temporarily called (B)), the weight ratio of (A) is usually from about 5 to about 90% by weight, preferably from about 10 to about 85% by weight, more preferably from about 15 to about 80% by weight, particularly preferably from about 30 to about 80% by weight, cased on the salt of (A) and (B).<br>
In the case of a controlled release composition containing a physiologically active substance or salt thereof, hydroxynaphthoic acid or salt thereof and lactic<br>
acid polymer or salt thereof, the compounding amount of hydroxynaphthoic acid or salt thereof is from about 1/2 to about 2 mol, about 3/4 to about 4/3 mol, particularly preferably from about 4/5 to about 6/5 mol, based on one mol of a physiologically active substance or salt thereof.<br>
The design of a composition of the present invention will be described below on a controlled release composition containing a physiologically active substance, hydroxynaphthoic acid and lactic acid polymer wherein the physiologically active substance is basic. In this case, a physiologically active substance as a base and hydroxynaphthoic acid as an acid coexist in the composition, and in either the case of compounding them as free bodies in the composition or the case of compounding them as a salt in the composition, the dissociation equilibrium is satisfied in each case under aqueous conditions or in the presence of a slight amount of water at a certain point in producing the composition Since the salt formed by hydroxynaphthoic acid which is slightly water-soluble and a physiologically active substance is believed to be slightly water-soluble though varying depending on the property of the physiologically active substance, the dissociation equilibrium shifts to the side of formation of such a slightly water-soluble salt.<br>
For producing a composition containing a basic<br>
physiologically active substance in high content, it is desirable that most of the physiologically active substances are protonated to give the above-mentioned slightly water-soluble salt, from the standpoint of the above-mentioned dissociation equilibrium. For this purpose, it is desirable to compound at least a physiologically active substance or salt thereof and approximately equivalent amount of hydroxynaphthoic acid or salt thereof. Next, the controlled release mechanism of a physiologically active substance contained in the composition will be described below. In the above-mentioned compounding composition, most of physiologically active substances are protonated and exist in the presence of counter ions. Most of the counter ions are hydroxynaphthoic acid (preferably, hydroxynaphzhoic acid). After the composition is administered into an organism, oligomers and monomers form due to the decomposition of a lactic acid polymer, however when the polymer is a lactic acid-glycolic acid polymer, the produced oligomer (lactic acid-glycolic acid oligomer) and monomer (lactic acid or glycolic acid) necessarily have one carboxyl group, which also can be counter ions of a physiologically active substance. Release of a physiologically active substance is not accompanied by movement of electric charge, namely, it is released in the form of a salt maintaining a counter<br>
ion, and as the movable counter ion species, hydroxynaphthoic acid, lactic acid-glycolic acid oligomer (such molecular weight as to enable movement) and monomer (lactic acid or glycolic acid) are listed, as describe above.<br>
When a plurality of acids coexist, a strongly acidic salt is dominantly formed generally though differing depending on the composition ratio. Regarding the pKa of hydroxynaphthoic acid, for example, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid has a pKa of 2.708 (CHEMICAL HANDBOOK, BASIC BOOK II, The Chemical Society of Japan, published on September 25, 1969) . On the other hand, though pKa of a carboxyl group of a lactic acid-glycolic acid oligomer is not known, it can be calculated based on pKa of lactic acid or glycolic acid (= 3.86 or 3-83) according to the principle " change of free energy by introduction of a substituent can be approximated by additive law " . Contribution by a substituent to the dissociation constant has been found and can be utilized (Table 4.1 in "pKa Prediction for Organic Acid and Bases" , D.D.Perrin, B.Dempsey and E.. P. Serjeant, 1981) . Since pKas for a hydroxyl group and an ester bond are<br>
ApKa (OH) = -0.90 and ApKa (ester bond) = —1.7 respectively, pKa of a carboxyl group of a lactic acid-<br>
glycolic acid oligomer is calculated, in view of contribution by an ester bond nearest to the dissociation group, as follow: pKa = pKa (lactic acid or glycolic acid) - A pKa (OH) + pKa (ester bond) = 3.06 or 3.03. As a result, since hydroxynaphthoic acid is a stronger acid than lactic acid (pKa = 3.86), glycolic acid (pKa = 3.83), and further, lactic acid-glycolic acid oligomer, it is supposed that in the above-mentioned composition, a salt of hydroxynaphthoic acid and a physiologically active substance is formed dominantly, and that the property of this salt mainly determines the controlled releasing property of a physiologically active substance in the composition. As the above-mentioned physiologically active substance, the above-mentioned physiologically active substances and the like are listed.<br>
Here, a salt is formed of hydroxynaphthoic acid with a physiologically active substance which is slightly water-soluble but not water-soluble preferably exerts an influence on the controlled release mechanism. That is, as clarified in the consideration of the above-mentioned acid dissociation constant, the salt of hydroxynaphthoic acid which is a stronger acid than the above-mentioned lactic acid-glycolic oligomer and monomer exists dominantly at the initial period of releasing as the hydrolyzable salt of a physiologically active substance, and as a result, the<br>
solubility and distribution properties of the salt into body tissue become determining factors of the releasing speed of a physiologically active substance, therefore, the initial releasing pattern of a drug can be controlled by the compounding amount of hydroxynaphthoic acid. Then, with decrease in hydroxynaphthoic acid and increase in oligomers and monomers generated by the hydrolysis of a lactic acid polymer, the releasing mechanism of a physiologically active substance having an oligomer and monomer as counter ions becomes dominant gradually, and even if hydroxynaphthoic acid disappears substantially from the " composition" , release of a stable physiologically active substance is retained. Further, enhancement of incorporation efficiency of a physiologically active substance in producing a controlled release composition, and capability of suppression of the initial excess release after administration of a physiologically active substance incorporated can also be explained.<br>
The role of hydroxynaphthoic acid in a controlled release composition containing a hydroxynaphthoate of a physiologically active peptide can also be explained by the above-mentioned mechanism.<br>
The term "water-insolubility" in this specification means a case in which when the above-mentioned substance is stirred at a temperature of 40 °C or lower in distilled<br>
water for 4 hours, the weight of a substance dissolved in 1 L of this solution is 25 mg or less.<br>
The term " slight water-solubility " in this specification means a case in which the above-mentioned weight is over 25 mg and 5 g or less. When the above-mentioned substance is a salt of a physiologically active substance, the weight of a physiologically active substance dissolved in the above-mentioned operation is used for application of the above-mentioned definition.<br>
Though the form of a controlled release composition in this specification is not particularly restricted, the form of a fine particle is preferable, and the form of a microsphere (also called microcapsule in the case of a controlled release composition containing a lactic acid polymer) is particularly preferable. The term microsphere means an injectable fine particle in the form of sphere which can be dispersed in a solution. The verification of the form can be conducted, for example, by observation by a scanning type electron microscope.<br>
The method of producing a controlled release composition (for example, microcapsule) containing the physiologically active substance or salt thereof of the present invention and the lactic acid polymer or salt thereof of the present invention is exemplified below.<br>
