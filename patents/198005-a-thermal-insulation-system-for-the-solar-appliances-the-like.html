"A THERMAL INSULATION SYSTEM FOR THE SOLAR APPLIANCES &amp; THE LIKE"<br>
Mr Arun Hari Kulkarni Hari-Krupaa building 4th floor 326 Raastaa Peth PUNE-411011 MAHARASHTRA STATE, INDIA.<br>
Nationality: India<br><br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
                                                               13-9-2004<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
13 SEP 2004<br><br>
More particularly, this invention provides the new construction(s}_of thermal insulationfs), and, thus, also provides new solar cooker. Solar water heater. &amp; other Solar apnliances. This invention provides economy in the consumption of the thermal insulation materials, without sacrificing any of the desired technical property(s); in fact, the technical properties are bettered ; and thus, the invention also offers the new varieties of appliances.<br>
In this description, the following terms apply: "appliances" refers to appliances, apparatus, machines, equipment/s &amp; the like "insulation" refers to "thermal insolation",<br>
"solar cooker" includes all types of SOLAR appliances and the like for installation &amp; conservation of all types of energy/s including solar energy, for the purpose of cooking, heating, lighting, refrigerating, air-conditioning, drying, ventilating, water-supply, sanitary purposes, industrial purposes, and the like.<br>
The significance &amp; beauty of the invention is in selecting particular &amp; peculiar construction of a well defined block or volume of vacuum or air, wherein the block or volume of vacuum or air allows the desired thermal-heat-radiation to penetrate &amp; reach to eg, food to be cooked in solar cooker, but on the other hand the same block of air blocks or prevents, in the mast effective mamner, the heat losses from the cooked food ie hot product<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Conventional Thermal insulations and the solar cookers making use of the thermal insuiation(s) are in use in equipment, general purpose apparatus, industrial machines, and electrical applications &amp; the like, since many decades. And, depending on the requirements, the appliances are insulated, thermally for various purposes like:<br>
1	To minimize heat losses from a hot body like a tank of hot water,<br>
2	To isolate thermal zones, &amp;or to minimize or prevent heat-transfer.<br>
Presently, the thermal insulations are provided by means of variety of materials like asbestos, glasB-wool, fiber-glass in various forms, ceramic wool<br><br><br>
pads, rock-wool, animal-woolen-felt-pads, wooden-saw-dust, waste/s from rice-mill/s, waste/s from jute mill/s, ...and the like item/s. But none of these make use of vacuum  &amp; or air as an insulation.<br>
Regarding Patents-"SEARCH"; with respect to insulation/s &amp; Solar appliances, there are already few Patents. The Patent Number/s, the Subject matter/s, &amp; Applicant/s is given below :<br>
Patent No       subject (in short)	Applicant<br>
153303	Process of NiCr plating on Aluminium<br>
155298	black coatings on metal	CSIR<br>
156459	coating of solar cells with anti-reflection film<br>
157402	solar water heater with black bodies &amp; fresnel lens DhrbesBiswas<br>
160624	solar energy refrigeration<br>
162938	improved solar cooker, box, evacuated	IIT Kanpur<br>
169135	solar water heater	Tata Energy<br>
170245	solar water heater	this Inventor<br>
All these, however, refer to subjects other than what is proposed in this invention. Further, all the Prior Art/s item/s have some drawbacks as mentioned below : The DEFICIENCY(S) OF THE PRIOR ART:<br>
1	The thermal insulations are non-transparent.   So, solar rays cannot pass<br>
, through, if needed.<br>
2	Insulation(s) is/are "solid" in nature, so weight of insulation is more with respect to vacuum &amp; or air, so also the wt of the appliance/s is more.<br>
3	Qualitatively, the property/s of the presently used insulations is less or inferior, with respect to vacuum &amp; or air which are extremely bad conductors of heat.<br>
4	Specific or special construction of the enclosure to contain or hold the solid insulation is necessary; &amp; this construction is always "heavy", &amp; adds to weight<br><br>
Presently, no one makes as per volume or block of "vacuum or air" now proposed; where vacuum or air offers improved &amp; best insulation.<br>
And, incidentally, good or improved insulation is the prime requirement of any machine.<br>
MY INVENTION: OBJECTS:<br>
1	To make the volume/s or "block/s" of vacuum or air, suitably hermetically sealed, in any size &amp; shape, through which Solar heat energy can pass, allowing an object eg food to be heated &amp; cooked.<br>
2	To use &amp; act the volume/s or "block/s" of vacuum or air, as the thermal insulation, based on the scientific, technological, &amp; engineering principles.<br>
3	The block of vacuum or air is enclosed or contained in two [2] modes :<br><br>
3.1	either transparent walls such as glass-panes, PVC or acrylic or Polycarbonate (PC) &amp; the like sheet/s,<br>
3.2	or non-transparent wall/s of sheet/s of Aluminium (Al), iron or galvanized iron (GI), asbestos, ply-wood, hard-board, and the like.<br><br>
4	To make solar cooker &amp; various other appliance/s &amp; the like with the blocks of air as abovementioned.<br>
5	To reduce the consumption of materials, &amp; thus achieve economy.<br><br>
DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will now be described with the help of suitable drawings &amp; figures, by means of explanatory numerals marked thereon.     The drawings &amp; figures are schematic only.      Drawings are not to scale.    Drawings represent non-restrictive examples. Drawings consist of thirteen [13] figures : FIGURE [1J shows how solar thermal energy may be available from the Sun. FIGURES [2 &amp; 3] show the existing solar cooker, &amp; how it is used. FIGURES [4 to 9] show) some examples of the new thermal insulation<br>
) &amp; the new solar cookers as per this invention. FIGURES [10 to 13] show) some examples of the new thermal insulation/s &amp;<br>
) the new solar water heaters as per mis invention.<br>
Referrinig to figures, fig [1] shows the Sun at position/s of East (101) in the morning at say 6 hr, at "top" (102) at 12 hr, &amp; at West (103) in the evening<br>
at say 18 hr.   The hourly position/s of the Sun is shown as (6), (7), (8), (9),	<br>
(17), (18), respectively, at 6 hr, 7 hr, 8 hr,	17 hr, 18 hr.    Incidently it may<br>
also be viewed mat the curve joining the points (6)-(7)-(8)—-(17)-(18) may be considered as the path of the Sun with respect to the earthly object located at Point "P". If an object or a product eg a solar cooker (105) is placed at the point "P" (104), then the incidence of Solar-Rays at any respective time is in the following directions. (6) -&gt; P at 6 hr, (7) -» P at 7 hr, (8) -&gt; P at 8 hr, (9) -&gt; P at 9 hr,.. .&amp; so on. A typical Sun-Ray at 8 hr is shown in the fig. It is desirable, then, that the mechanism of using or collecting or absorbing the heat MUST be "oriented" if maximum benefits of the heat-absorption are to be derived. At point "P" is placed or located the product, process, or project &amp; the like which is scheduled to receive, harness &amp; use the Solar-Energy. A typical example may be that of a conventional solar cooker placed at "P", for heating &amp; cooking the food placed inside the cooker.<br>
FIGURES [2 &amp; 3] show the existing solar cooker (105), &amp; how it is used. The cooker (105) is typically a squarish box. In the cooker (105), is put a container ie box (108). The box (108) contains food articles (109) required to be heated &amp; cooked.   The cooker (105) has vertical walls (106) on top-edges of<br><br><br>
which is placed a square transparent glass sheet as a cover (107) to close the volume or space of the cooker (105). In order that the Solar-Rays should not get blocked by the vertical wall (106), and that the Solar-Rays should fall on the container (108) &amp; food (109), the Solar-rays are required to be managed, guided, diverted or directed. And for this, the cooker (105) is equipped with a flat-mirror (110). The mirror (110) is supported-&amp;-protected at the back side (111) by a sheet-metal (111) in square form. At one end or edge (112) of the sheet-metal (111) is hinged at (112). The mechanism of "hinging", &amp; thus the inclination can be adjusted &amp; set in any particular position &amp; locked in that state by any suitable locking device (113).<br>
WORKING of the cooker (105): Suppose that the cooker is placed at the point or place "P" of fig [1] at 8 AM ie at 8 hr. At 8 hr, the direction of Solar-Rays is in the direction {8 -&gt; P}. A typical ray is shown by (8b) in fig [21 wherein (8b) is parallel to {8 -&gt; P} of fig [1]. To make the Solar-ray (8b) "fall" on the food, the mirror (110) is adjusted &amp; locked so that ray/s (8b) are reflected, &amp; acquire the new direction/position (8c). And thus at 8 hr, the food starts getting heat But, with respect to "P", the position of the Sun is constantly changing; &amp; soon, the Rays will not be falling "on" the food, and, in fact, the rays will be "off" the food. For example, if any adjustment of the mirror (110) is not made, after some time, eg in this particular case of fig [2], after 11 hr, the Rays will be blocked by the back side (111) of the mirror (110) itself, defeating the very purpose &amp; usefulness of the cooker. To avoid the defeat, then, it is required that the mirror must be adjusted, (theoretically, constantly &amp; continuously), but at least practically, frequently &amp; repeatedly. As one more example, in the late afternoon, as shown in FIG [3], the entire cooker itself is required to be re¬positioned ie re-oriented ie turned through 180 degrees. And, all these operations of adjustments &amp; re-orientations are required to be done under hot Sun! Naturally, all these operations are tedious, cumbersome, tiresome, &amp; difficult. That apart, still, all adjustments are manual &amp; non-accurate. It is further noted that the box of cooker (105) is not insulated from all sides or faces to minimize the heat-loss of the absorbed heat. INCIDENTALLY, all these very facts have rendered the present cooker (105) unpopular &amp; unsuccessful.<br><br>
In light of above, this invention is now explained, in FIGURES [4 to 13]: Figures [4 to 9] show the new mode of the said thermal insulation system, &amp; the new cooker. In fig [4], in the new Solar cooker (121), the food-container (108) with food (109) is kept on the base (122). The said new Solar cooker (121) has, importantly, the cover (126) consisting of two separate transparent sheets (127) &amp; (128) of any suitable material eg glass, Polycarbonate (PC), or Acrylic, &amp; the like. These two sheets (127) &amp; (128) contain a block or volume (129) of air. The base (122) is composed of two distinct sheet metals (123) &amp; (124) &amp; the like, separated by a block or volume (125) of air. This block of air (125) is also sealed. The said sheets (127-&amp;-128, &amp;, 123-&amp;-124) are separated, typically, by a distance or gap of 30 mm, though any gap is workable. FIGURE [4], shows, as an example, the cover in semi-or-hemi-spherical construction. At any given time, whatever may be the position of the Sun, now, as per this invention, the Solar-rays do fall straight "onto" the food, through the transparent layers of plastic sheet/s &amp; the like, &amp; through the air. One such position of the Sun-ray is shown by "S", where "S" stands for Sun.<br>
"Important: It is to be noted that the Sun's heat is in the form of "Rays-&amp;-Radiation". The heating-up of the food takes place due to Radiation which "goes through" vacuum &amp; air easily. For example, there is the vacuum, or there is "nothing" in between the Sun &amp; the earth, &amp; still the Sun's "Radiation" reaches earth's atmosphere. And also, the heat "Radiation" travels further through earth's atmosphere which contains "air". Likewise, me SunRay (S) goes through the said block/s of vacuum or air (129 &amp; 134). This is true for any position of "S". Next, as cover is transparent, any "adjustment" of the cooker, as was required in the prior art, is not at all now necessary. And still the food gets directly heated After heating &amp; cooking the food, the cooling of the hot food is minimized, delayed, or, in feet, prevented, by the said blocks or volumes (129 &amp; 134) of vacuum or air which is the best thermal insulation, as air has the lowest thermal conductivity among all known materials. It should be noted here that the cooling is due to the loss of heat due to conduction &amp; convection. The "thermal conductivity" of vacuum is zero, &amp; of air "the lowest" of all materials. Next, the "convection" is zero or nil in vacuum, &amp; "extremely low" in "sealed" air, as the air is sealed &amp; locked, &amp; so any movement or convection current of air is prevented. "<br><br><br>
The insulation-block (129) is in addition to the one already existing (134); and<br>
this insulation-block (134) is also sealed.   Thus, this Invention provides "two"<br>
insulation-blocks. That is the said new Solar cooker (121) is "double-insulated".<br>
Thus the new cooker (121) is superior in performance.   The new cooker is<br>
convenient in use as any adjustments with respect to Sun-Rays are not required. The cover (126} can be in any configuration, shape &amp; size; (and so also<br>
the cooker am be in ant shape &amp; size)-   These things are NOT restricted to any<br>
one particular shape. And so, accordingly,<br>
FIGURES [4 to 9] show that the cover can be in any imaginative form : spherical, conical, cylindrical, pyramid, rectangular, &amp; or any combination/s thereof, and the like: wherein,<br>
FIGURE  [4] shows semi-spherical cover, as already explained, and,<br>
FIGURE  [5] shows semi-cylindrical cover,<br>
FIGURE  [6] shows pyramid shaped cover,<br>
FIGURE [7] shows conical  shaped cover,<br>
FIGURE  [8] shows squarish or rectangular, &amp; sloping cover with flat top (131),<br>
FIGURE  [9] shows cylindrical cover with flat top (132).<br>
The flat tops (131) or (132) facilitate "incidence" of the maximum possible Sun-Rays on the food during time of say 10 hr to 14 hr.<br>
FIGURES [10 to 13] show Solar water heater/s, insulated with the new principle as explained in this invention specification.<br>
{Incidentally, this inventor was granted the Patent Number 170245 for the Solar water heater/s; and the present invention is the new technique}. FIGURES [10 to 13] show the transparent &amp; distinct volume or block of air (129). Thus the water-tank (133) of hot water is further insulated with a new &amp; better mode, with the block of air (129) hermetically sealed &amp; held in between two transparent sheets (127) &amp; (128). Here also, the insulation-block (129) is in addition to the one already existing (134) as per this invention; and this insulation-block (134) is also hermetically sealed. Thus, this Invention provides "two" insulation-blocks. Depending on the design/s, the tank (133) will have corresponding base (122). FIGURES [10 to 13] are only few representatives of the many possible combinations &amp; or examples of which only one view is shown in each figure &amp; is explained below ;<br><br>
FIGURE [10] shows) atypical solar water heater with the transparent block of ) insulation which looks similar to roof-top. The water-tank ) has also similar shape.<br>
FIGURE [11] shows) a typical solar water heater with the transparent block of ) insulation which looks similar to roof-top. The water-tank ) is cylindrical like a barrel, or spherical like a ball.<br>

FIGURE [13] shows) a typical solar water heater with the transparent block of ) insulation which can be in cylindrical or spherical shape. ) And the water-tank is cylindrical or spherical.<br>
LIKEWISE, the insulation cover can be in any form, shape &amp; size; so also the water tank; &amp; so also the solar water heater: in spherical, conical, cylindrical, pyramid, rectangular, &amp; or any combination/s thereof, and the like.<br>
Likewise, further, this principle of "providing effective thermal insulation by means of hermetically sealed block or volume of air" is extended to insulate &amp; to make all appliances, machines, apparatus, equipment &amp; the like operating on Solar or other Energy system/s.   Separate drawings for those are not given here.<br>
ADVANTAGES, APPLICATIONS, &amp; USE OF THIS INVENTION:<br>
1	Improvement in simplicity &amp; thus flexibility, &amp; use.<br>
2	The absorption, &amp; harnessing of    the Solar energy is  maximized, regardless the position of the Sun in the sky during entire day-time.<br>
3	Use of air as an insulation, in the best possible manner.<br>
