Apparatus and method for robust classification of audio<br>
signals, and method for establishing and operating an<br>
audio-signal database, as well as computer program.<br>
Description<br>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and<br>
a method for robust classification of audio signals, as<br>
well as to a method for establishing and operating an<br>
audio-signal database, in particular to an apparatus and a<br>
method for classifying audio signals wherein a fingerprint<br>
for the audio signal is generated and evaluated.<br>
In recent years, the availability of multimedia data<br>
material has increased more and more. High-performance<br>
computers, the strong increase in availability of broad-<br>
band data networks, high-performance compression methods,<br>
and high-capacity storage media have made a major<br>
contribution to this development. There is a particularly<br>
strong increase in the number of available audio contents.<br>
Audio files coded in accordance with the MPEG1/2-Layer 3<br>
standard, shortly referred to as MP3, are particularly<br>
widely used.<br>
The large amount of audio data which very often represent<br>
pieces of music makes it necessary to develop apparatus and<br>
methods enabling audio data to be classified and specific<br>
audio data to be found. Since the audio data are present in<br>
various formats which do not enable exact reconstruction of<br>
the audio content in every case due to, for example, lossy<br>
compression or to transmission via a transmission channel<br>
subject to distortion, there is a need for methods which<br>
assess and/or compare audio signals on the grounds of a<br>
content-based characterization rather than on the grounds<br>
of the representation in terms of values.<br><br>
One field of application of a means for content-based<br>
characterization of an audio signal is, for example, the<br>
provision of metadata to an audio signal. This is<br>
particularly relevant in connection with pieces of music.<br>
Here, the title and the performer may be determined for a<br>
given portion of a piece of music. Thus, additional<br>
information, e.g. about the album containing the music<br>
title, as well as copyright information may also be<br>
determined.<br>
With content-based characterization, features of an audio<br>
signal must be extracted from the present representation of<br>
an audio signal. It has proven advantageous, in particular,<br>
to associate an audio signal with a set of data which is<br>
obtained on the basis of the audio content of the audio<br>
signal and may be used for classifying, searching for or<br>
comparing an audio signal. Such a set of data is also<br>
referred to as a fingerprint.<br>
In recent years, a number of methods for content-based<br>
indexing of audio signals have been published. By means of<br>
such apparatus, music signals, or, generally, acoustic<br>
signals may be associated with a specific class or pattern<br>
on account of a preset property. Thus, acoustic signals may<br>
be categorized by specific similarities.<br>
The major requirements placed upon a fingerprint of an<br>
audio signal will be described in more detail below. Due to<br>
the large number of audio signals available it is necessary<br>
that the fingerprint may be produced with moderate<br>
computing expenditure. This reduces the time required for<br>
generating the fingerprint, and without this, large-scale<br>
application of the fingerprint is not possible. In<br>
addition, the fingerprint must not take up too much memory.<br>
In many case it is required to store a large number of<br>
fingerprints in one database. It may be required, in<br>
particular, to keep a large number of fingerprints in the<br>
main memory of a computer. This clearly shows that the data<br><br>
volume of the fingerprint must be clearly smaller than the<br>
volume of data of the actual audio signal. It is required,<br>
on the other hand, that the fingerprint be characteristic<br>
for an audio piece. This means that two audio signals with<br>
different contents must also have different fingerprints.<br>
In addition, one important requirement placed upon a<br>
fingerprint is that the fingerprints of two audio signals<br>
which represent the same audio content but differ from each<br>
other by, e.g., a distortion, be sufficiently similar so as<br>
to be identified as belonging together in a comparison.<br>
This property is typically referred to as robustness of the<br>
fingerprint. This is particularly important where two audio<br>
signals that have been compressed and/or coded using<br>
different methods are to be compared. Furthermore, audio<br>
signals that have been transmitted via a channel subject to<br>
distortion are to have fingerprints which are very similar<br>
to the original fingerprint.<br>
A number of methods have already been known by which<br>
features and/or fingerprints may be extracted from an audio<br>
signal. US patent No. 5,918,223 discloses a method for<br>
content-based analysis, storage, retrieval and segmentation<br>
of audio information. An analysis of audio data creates a<br>
set of numerical values which is also referred to as a<br>
feature vector and which may be used to classify and rank<br>
the similarity between individual audio pieces. The<br>
features used for characterizing and/or classifying audio<br>
pieces with regard to their contents are the loudness of a<br>
piece, the pitch, the clarity of sound, the bandwidth and<br>
the so-called Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)<br>
of an audio piece. The values per block or frame are stored<br>
and subject to a first time derivation. From this,<br>
statistical quantities are calculated, such as the mean<br>
value or the standard deviation, the statistical quantities<br>
being calculated for each of these features, including the<br>
first derivations, thus to describe a variation over time.<br>
This set of statistical quantities forms the feature<br><br>
vector. The feature vector is thus a fingerprint of the<br>
audio piece and may be stored in a database.<br>
The specialist publication "Multimedia Content Analysis",<br>
Yao Wang et al. , IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, November<br>
2000, pages 12 to 36, discloses a similar concept to index<br>
and characterize multimedia pieces. To ensure efficient<br>
association of an audio signal with a specific class, a<br>
number of features and classifiers have been developed.<br>
Features proposed for classifying the contents of a multi-<br>
media piece are time-domain features or frequency-domain<br>
features. These include the volume, the pitch as well as<br>
the base frequency of an audio-signal form, spectral<br>
features, such as the energy content of a band with regard<br>
to the total energy content, cutoff frequencies in the<br>
spectral curve and others. In addition to short-term<br>
features relating to the so-called quantities per block of<br>
samples of the audio signal, long-term quantities are also<br>
proposed which relate to a relatively long period of time<br>
of the audio piece. Further typical features are formed by<br>
forming a time difference of the respective features. The<br>
features obtained block by block are rarely passed on as<br>
such directly for classification, since their data rate is<br>
still much too high. A common form of further processing<br>
consists in calculating short-term statistics. This<br>
includes, e.g., the formation of a mean value, a variance,<br>
and time-related correlation coefficients. This reduces the<br>
data rate and results, on the other hand, in an enhanced<br>
recognition of an audio signal.<br>
WO 02/065782 describes a method of forming a fingerprint<br>
into a multimedia signal. The method is based on the<br>
extraction of one or several features from an audio signal.<br>
For this purpose, the audio signal is divided into<br>
segments, and each segment sees a processing by blocks and<br>
frequency bands. The band-by-band calculation of the<br>
energy, tonality and standard deviation of the spectrum of<br>
power density shall be mentioned as examples.<br><br>
In addition, DE 101 34 471 and DE 101 09 648 disclose an<br>
apparatus and a method for classifying an audio signal,<br>
wherein the fingerprint is obtained on the basis of a<br>
measure for the tonality of the audio signal. Here, the<br>
fingerprint enables audio signals to be classified in a<br>
robust and content-based manner. The above documents give<br>
several possibilities of generating a tonality measure<br>
across an audio signal. In each case, the calculation of<br>
the tonality is based on a conversion of a segment of the<br>
audio signal to the spectral domain. The tonality can then<br>
be calculated in parallel for a frequency band or for all<br>
frequency bands. The disadvantage of such a method is that<br>
the fingerprint is no longer sufficiently informative as<br>
the distortion of the audio signals increases, and that it<br>
is then no longer possible to recognize the audio signal<br>
with satisfactory reliability. However, distortions occur<br>
in very many cases, in particular when audio signals are<br>
transmitted via a system exhibiting low transmission<br>
quality. Currently, this is the case, in particular, with<br>
mobile systems and/or in the event of high data<br>
compression. Such systems, such as mobile telephones, are<br>
primarily configured for bi-directional transmission of<br>
voice signals and frequently transmit music signals only<br>
with a very poor quality. This is added to by other factors<br>
which may have a negative impact on the quality of a signal<br>
transmitted, e.g. microphones of poor quality, channel<br>
interferences and transcoding effects. The consequence of a<br>
deterioration of the signal quality is a recognition<br>
performance which is highly decreased with regard to an<br>
apparatus for identifying and classifying a signal.<br>
Research has shown that in particular when using an<br>
apparatus and/or a method according to DE 101 34 471 and<br>
DE 101 09 648, by changes to the system while maintaining<br>
the recognition criterion of tonality (spectral flatness<br>
measure), no further significant improvements of the<br>
recognition performance are possible.<br><br>
It may be stated that known methods for classifying audio<br>
signals and/or for forming a fingerprint of an audio signal<br>
mostly cannot meet the demands placed upon them. Problems<br>
still exist with regard to the robustness against<br>
distortions of the audio signal, also towards interferences<br>
superimposed on the audio signal.<br>
In a plurality of current systems for storing and<br>
transmitting audio signals, high signal distortions and<br>
disturbances occur. This is the case, in particular, when a<br>
lossy data compression method or a disturbed transmission<br>
channel are used. Lossy compression is used whenever the<br>
data rate required for storing or transmitting an audio<br>
signal is to be reduced. Examples are data compression<br>
according to the MP3 standard and the methods used with<br>
digital mobile transceivers. In both cases, low data rates<br>
are achieved in that the signals are quantized as coarsely<br>
as possible for the transmission. The audio bandwidth is,<br>
in part, highly limited. In addition, signal portions which<br>
are not perceived at all by the human ear or are only<br>
perceived to a very small extent because they are, e.g.,<br>
masked by other signal portions, are suppressed.<br>
Disturbances, or interferences, on the transmission channel<br>
are very frequent with mobile voice transmission<br>
applications in common use today. More often than not, in<br>
particular, the reception quality is very poor, which<br>
becomes noticeable by means of increased noise on the audio<br>
signal transmitted. In addition, the transmission may be<br>
interrupted completely for a short time, so that a short<br>
section of an audio signal to be transmitted is missing<br>
completely. During such an interruption, a mobile phone<br>
generates a noise signal which is perceived to be less<br>
disturbing by a human user than full blanking of the audio<br>
signal. Finally, disturbances, or interferences, occur also<br>
during the handover from one mobile radio cell to another.<br>
All these interference effects must not represent too<br>
strong a corruption of the fingerprint, so that an<br><br>
identification of a disturbed audio signal is still<br>
possible at a high level of reliability.<br>
Finally, the transmission of audio signals is also<br>
influenced by the frequency response characteristic of the<br>
audio part. In particular small and cheap components, as<br>
are often used with mobile devices, have a pronounced<br>
frequency response and thus distort the audio signals to be<br>
identified.<br>
While a human listener may identify an audio signal with a<br>
high level of reliability even when the interferences and<br>
distortions described occur, the recognition performance<br>
audio signals decreases significantly, in the occurrence of<br>
disturbed, with audio signal recognition means utilizing a<br>
conventional fingerprint of an audio signal.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
concept for calculating a more robust fingerprint on the<br>
grounds of an audio signal.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus and a method for<br>
producing a fingerprint signal from an audio signal in<br>
accordance with claims 1 or 25, by an apparatus and a<br>
method for characterizing an audio signal as claimed in<br>
claims 2 6 or 27, and by a method for establishing an audio<br>
database as claimed in claim 28, a method for obtaining<br>
information on the basis of an audio-signal database as<br>
claimed in claim 2 9, and by a computer program as claimed<br>
in claim 31.<br>
The present invention is based on the findings that a<br>
fingerprint signal associated with an audio signal is<br>
robust against interferences in the case where use is made<br>
of a feature of the signal which is largely unaffected by<br>
various distortions of the signal and which is accessible,<br>
in a similar form, for acoustic perception by humans, i.e.<br>
which includes band energies and, in particular, scaled<br><br>
band energies, an additional degree of robustness against<br>
interferences of, e.g., a wireless channel being obtained<br>
by filtering the temporal course of the scaled band<br>
energies.<br>
Human hearing perceives audio signals in a manner in which<br>
they are subdivided into individual frequency bands.<br>
Accordingly, it is advantageous to determine the energy of<br>
an audio signal band by band. Therefore, the inventive<br>
apparatus includes a means for calculating energy values<br>
for several frequency bands. By this means, the spectral<br>
envelope of an audio signal is represented in a technically<br>
and psycho-acoustically useful approximation.<br>
In addition, the present invention is based on the findings<br>
that scaling of the energy values in several frequency<br>
bands both is in sync with human acoustic perception, and<br>
simplifies technological further processing of the energy<br>
values and enables the compensation of spectral signal<br>
distortions caused by a suboptimal frequency response of a<br>
transmission channel. Human acoustic perception may<br>
identify an audio signal even when individual frequency<br>
bands are elevated or attenuated in terms of their<br>
performance. In addition, a human listener may identify a<br>
signal independently of the volume. This ability of a human<br>
listener is copied by a means for scaling. Re-scaling of<br>
the band-by-band energy values is useful also for a<br>
technical application.<br>
By applying a filter operation to the band-by-band energy<br>
values, interferences may eventually be suppressed in the<br>
same manner as is done by human auditory perception.<br>
Temporal filtering of the band-by-band energy values is<br>
more efficient here than conventional filtering of the<br>
audio signal itself, and enables the formation of a<br>
fingerprint which is more robust against signal<br>
interferences than is common with conventional apparatus.<br><br>
By an inventive apparatus which combines a band-by-band<br>
determination of energy values in several frequency bands<br>
with scaling and filtering same, a robust fingerprint<br>
signal of an audio signal having a high level of validity<br>
may be produced.<br>
An advantage of the present apparatus is that the finger-<br>
print of an audio signal here is adjusted to human hearing.<br>
It is not only purely physical, but essentially psycho-<br>
acoustically based features that influence the fingerprint.<br>
When an inventive apparatus is applied, audio signals will<br>
then have similar fingerprints when a human listener would<br>
judge them as similar. The similarity of fingerprints<br>
correlates with the subjective perception of the similarity<br>
of audio signals as judged by a human listener.<br>
A result of the above-mentioned considerations is an<br>
apparatus for producing a fingerprint signal on the grounds<br>
of an audio signal, which apparatus allows being able to<br>
identify and classify even audio signals exhibiting signal<br>
interferences and distortions. The fingerprints are robust,<br>
in particular, with regard to noise, interferences<br>
occurring in channels, quantization effects and artefacts<br>
due to lossy data compression. Even distortion which occurs<br>
with regard to the frequency response has no significant<br>
influence on a fingerprint which has been produced with an<br>
inventive apparatus. Thus, an inventive apparatus for<br>
producing a fingerprint associated with an audio signal is<br>
well suited for employment in connection with mobile<br>
communication means, e.g. mobile phones according to the<br>
GSM, UMTS or DECT standards.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, compact fingerprints may be<br>
produced at a data rate of about lkByte per minute of audio<br>
material. This compactness allows very efficient further<br>
processing of the fingerprints in electronic data<br>
processing equipment.<br><br>
Additional advantages may be achieved by further<br>
improvement of details of the present method for forming a<br>
fingerprint of an audio signal.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a discrete Fourier transform is<br>
performed for a segment of an audio signal by means of a<br>
fast Fourier transform. Subsequently, the amounts of the<br>
Fourier coefficients are squared and summed up band by band<br>
to obtain energy values for a frequency band. An advantage<br>
of such a method is that the energy present in a frequency<br>
band may be calculated at low expense. In addition, a<br>
corresponding operation is already contained in the MPEG7<br>
standard and therefore does not need to be implemented<br>
separately. This reduces the development costs.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the frequency bands have<br>
variable bandwidths, the bandwidth being larger at high<br>
frequencies. Such a procedure is in line with human hearing<br>
and psycho-acoustic findings.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the means for scaling<br>
includes a means for taking the logarithm and a means,<br>
arranged downstream of the means for taking the logarithm,<br>
for suppressing a steady component. Such an arrangement is<br>
very advantageous, since both logarithmic normalization and<br>
an elimination of the influence of the signal level in the<br>
frequency bands is effected at low expense. A change of the<br>
signal level which is constant in time only entails a<br>
steady component in taking the algorithm. This steady<br>
component may be suppressed in a relatively simple manner<br>
by a suitable arrangement. The logarithmic normalization is<br>
very well adapted, by the way, to the human loudness<br>
perception.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described below in more detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying figures, wherein:<br><br>
Fig.1 shows a block diagram of an inventive apparatus<br>
for producing a fingerprint signal from an audio<br>
signal;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a detailed block diagram of a further<br>
embodiment of an inventive apparatus for<br>
producing a fingerprint signal from an audio<br>
signal;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a method<br>
for establishing an audio database; and<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a method<br>
for obtaining information on the grounds of an<br>
audio-signal database.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an inventive apparatus for<br>
producing a fingerprint signal from an audio signal, the<br>
apparatus being designated by 10 in its entirety. The<br>
apparatus is fed an audio signal 12 as an input signal. In<br>
a first stage 14, energy values are calculated for<br>
frequency bands, which will then be available in the form<br>
of a vector 16 of energy values. In a second stage 18, the<br>
energy values are scaled. A vector 20 of scaled energy<br>
values for several frequency bands will then be available.<br>
At a third stage 22, this vector is time-filtered. As an<br>
output signal of the apparatus, there will be a vector 24<br>
of scaled and filtered energy values for several frequency<br>
bands.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a detailed block diagram of an embodiment of<br>
an inventive apparatus for producing a fingerprint signal<br>
from an audio signal, which apparatus is designated by 30<br>
in its entirety. A pulse-code-modulated audio signal 32 is<br>
present at the input of the apparatus. This signal is fed<br>
to an MPEG-7 front end 34. At the output of the MPEG-7<br>
front end, there is a sequence of vectors 36, whose<br>
components represent the energies of the respective bands.<br><br>
This sequence of vectors is fed to a second stage 38 for<br>
processing the audio spectrum envelope. At the output<br>
thereof, there is a sequence of vectors 40 which represent,<br>
in their entirety, the fingerprint of the audio signal. The<br>
MPEG-7 front end 34 is part of the MPEG-7 audio standard<br>
and includes a means 50 for windowing the PCM-coded audio<br>
signal 32. At the output of the windowing means 50, there<br>
is a sequence of segments 52 of the audio signal, having a<br>
length of 30 ms. These are fed to a means 54 which<br>
calculates the spectra of the segments by means of a<br>
discrete Fourier transform, and at whose output Fourier<br>
coefficients 56 are present. A last/final means 58 forms<br>
the audio spectrum envelope (ASE). Here, the amounts of the<br>
Fourier coefficients 56 are squared and summed up band by<br>
band. This corresponds to calculating the band energies.<br>
The widths of the bands increase with an increase in<br>
frequency (logarithmic band classification), and may be<br>
determined by a further parameter. Thus, a vector 36<br>
results for each segment, the entries of which represent<br>
the energy in a frequency band of a segment of a length of<br>
30 ms. The MPEG-7 front end for calculating the band-by-<br>
band spectrum envelope of an audio segment is part of the<br>
MPEG-7 audio standard (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG 11 (MPEG):<br>
"Multimedia Content Description Interface - part 4: Audio",<br>
International Standard 15938-4, ISO/IEC, 2001) .<br>
The sequence of vectors obtained with the MPEG-7 front end<br>
is, as such, unsuitable with regard to robust<br>
classification of audio signals. Therefore, a further stage<br>
for processing the audio spectrum envelope is necessary to<br>
modify the sequence of vectors which serves as a feature,<br>
so that this feature obtains a higher robustness and a<br>
lower data rate.<br>
The means 38 for processing the audio spectrum envelope<br>
comprises, as a first stage, a means 70 for taking the<br>
logarithm of the band-by-band energy values 36. The energy<br>
values 72, the logarithm of which has been taken, are then<br><br>
fed to a low-pass filter 74. Downstream of the low-pass<br>
filter 74 there is a means 76 for decimating the number of<br>
energy values. The decimated sequence 78 of energy values<br>
is fed to a high-pass filter 80. The high-pass filtered<br>
sequence 82 of spectral energy values is eventually handed<br>
over to a signal-adapted quantizer 84. At the output<br>
thereof, there is, finally, a sequence of processed<br>
spectral values 40 which, in their entirety, represent the<br>
fingerprint.<br>
Based on the description of the structure of the apparatus<br>
for producing a fingerprint signal from an audio signal,<br>
the mode of operation will now be described in detail. The<br>
basis of the inventive apparatus for producing a<br>
fingerprint signal from an audio signal is the calculation<br>
of the band energies in several frequency bands of an<br>
audio-signal segment. This corresponds to determining the<br>
audio spectrum envelope. In the embodiment shown, this is<br>
achieved by the MPEG-7 front end 34 . It is preferred, in<br>
this embodiment, for the widths of the bands to increase<br>
with an increase in frequency, and for the energy values of<br>
the frequency bands to be available as a vector 36 of band-<br>
energy values at the output of the MPEG-7 front end 34.<br>
Such signal processing corresponds to human hearing,<br>
wherein perception is divided up into several frequency<br>
bands, the widths of which increase with an increase in<br>
frequency. Thus, the human auditory sensation is copied, in<br>
this respect, by the MPEG-7 front end 34.<br>
In a further processing step, the energy values are<br>
normalized band by band. The apparatus for normalizing<br>
includes two stages, a means 70 for taking the logarithm of<br>
the energy values and a high-pass filter 80. Here, taking<br>
the logarithm fulfils two tasks. On the one hand, taking<br>
the logarithm copies human perception of loudness.<br>
Especially with high volumes, or high levels of loudness,<br>
subjective perception by humans increases by a certain<br>
amount when the audio performance just doubles. A means 70<br><br>
for taking the logarithm exhibits exactly the same<br>
behavior. In addition, the means 70 for taking the<br>
logarithm has the advantage that the range of values for<br>
the energy values in a band is reduced, which enables a<br>
notation of figures which is clearly advantageous from a<br>
technical point of view. In particular, it is not necessary<br>
to use a floating-point notation, but a fixed-point<br>
notation may be used.<br>
In addition it should be mentioned that "taking the<br>
logarithm" here ought not to be understood in a strictly<br>
mathematical sense. Especially with smaller energies in a<br>
frequency band, taking the logarithm would lead to values<br>
of very large amounts. Neither is this useful from a<br>
technical point of view, nor does it correspond to the<br>
auditory sensation of humans. On the other hand, it is<br>
useful to use, for small energy values, an approximately<br>
linear characteristic or at least to set a lower limit to<br>
the range of values. This, in turn, corresponds to human<br>
perception, wherein a hearing threshold exists for small<br>
volumes, but a roughly logarithmic perception of the sound<br>
power occurs for high volumes. It may thus be established<br>
that the dynamics of the energy values which exhibit, as<br>
experience shows, a very large range of values, is<br>
compressed to a much smaller value by taking the logarithm.<br>
The operation of taking the logarithm in accordance with<br>
the above description thus approximately corresponds to a<br>
specific loudness formation. The choice of the logarithmic<br>
base is irrelevant, since this only corresponds to a<br>
multiplicative constant that may be compensated by further<br>
signal processing, in particular by a final quantization.<br>
In addition to compressing the dynamic range and to<br>
performing an adaptation to human hearing, scaling also<br>
fulfils the task of making the formation of a fingerprint<br>
from an audio signal independent of the level of the audio<br>
signal. To facilitate understanding, it is to be taken into<br>
account that the fingerprint may be formed both from an<br><br>
uncorrupted signal that was available originally, and from<br>
a signal transmitted via a transmission channel. Here, a<br>
change in the ,loudness, or level, may occur. In addition,<br>
in a transmission via a transmission path with a non-<br>
constant frequency response, individual frequency<br>
components are attenuated or amplified. Thus, two signals<br>
having the same contents may exhibit varying spectral<br>
energy distribution. In the following it shall be assumed<br>
that the frequency-response distortion between two signals<br>
is independent of time. It shall further be assumed that<br>
the distortion within a frequency band is approximately<br>
constant. In this case it may be assumed that the energies<br>
in a predefined frequency band only differ by a<br>
multiplicative constant which is constant in time for two<br>
signals with identical audio contents. The operation of<br>
taking the logarithm maps a multiplicative constant, which<br>
is constant in time, to an additive term which is constant<br>
in time. Thus, after taking the logarithm of the energies,<br>
an amplification and/or attenuation constant, by which two<br>
signals differ, appears as a constant additive term in the<br>
feature value. This term is filtered off from the signal by<br>
applying a high-pass filter 80 which, in particular,<br>
suppresses a steady component. Other filters which suppress<br>
a steady component may also be used. It should be pointed<br>
out, in particular, that in the present arrangement, such<br>
an adaptation occurs separately for each frequency band.<br>
Thus, the normalization of levels for each frequency band<br>
is independent, and a spectral distortion of a signal may<br>
be compensated. By the way, this corresponds to the ability<br>
of human hearing to identify spectrally distorted audio<br>
signals.<br>
In addition, the apparatus for producing a fingerprint<br>
signal from an audio signal includes, in the embodiment<br>
present here, a low-pass filter 74. The latter filters, in<br>
the time domain, the sequence of the energy values for the<br>
frequency bands. Again, filtering occurs separately for the<br>
frequency bands. Low-pass filtering is useful, since the<br><br>
temporal consequences of the values, the logarithm of which<br>
has been taken, contain both components of the signal to be<br>
identified, and interferences. Low-pass filtering smoothes<br>
the temporal course of the energy values. Thus, components<br>
which are rapidly variable, which are mostly caused by<br>
interferences, are removed from the sequence of the energy<br>
values for the frequency bands. This results in an improved<br>
suppression of spurious signals.<br>
At the same time, the amount of information to be processed<br>
is reduced by low-pass filtering by means of the low-pass<br>
filter 74, elimination being particularly focused on the<br>
high-frequency components. Due to the low-pass character of<br>
the signal, the signal may be decimated by a certain factor<br>
D by means of a decimation means 7 6 connected downstream of<br>
the low-pass filter 74, without losing information<br>
("sampling theorem"). This means that only a smaller number<br>
of samples is used for the energy in a frequency band.<br>
Here, the data rate is reduced by a factor of D.<br>
The combination of the low-pass filter 74 and the<br>
decimation means 7 6 thus allows not only suppression of<br>
interferences by means of low-pass filtering, but it<br>
allows, in particular, suppression of redundant information<br>
and thus also a reduction of the amount of data for the<br>
fingerprint signal. Therefore, all the information that has<br>
no direct influence on the auditory sensation of humans are<br>
suppressed. The decimation factor is determined using the<br>
low-pass frequency of the filter.<br>
Finally it is expedient to quantize the energy values thus<br>
processed in a quantizing means 84 in a signal-adapted<br>
manner. In the process, finite integer values are<br>
associated with the real-valued energy values. The<br>
quantization intervals may be non-uniform, as the case may<br>
be, and may be determined by the signal statistics.<br>
Alternatively, it may be advantageous to use small<br>
quantization intervals for small values and large<br><br>
quantization intervals for high values. In particular,<br>
interconnecting the high-pass filter 80 and a quantizing<br>
means 84 provides an advantage. The high-pass filter 80<br>
reduces the range of values of the signal. This allows<br>
quantization at a low resolution. Similarly, many values<br>
are mapped to a small number of quantization steps, which<br>
allows the quantized signal to be coded by means of entropy<br>
codes, and thus reduces the amount of data.<br>
In addition, signal-adapted quantization may be effected by<br>
forming amplitude statistics for the signal in a pre-<br>
processing means. Thus it is known which amplitude values<br>
come up with the highest frequency in the signal. The<br>
characteristics of the quantizers are determined on the<br>
basis of the relative frequencies of the respective values.<br>
Fine quantization levels are selected for frequently<br>
occurring amplitude values, whereas amplitude values and/or<br>
the associated amplitude intervals which rarely occur in<br>
signals are quantized with larger quantization levels. This<br>
affords the benefit that for a given signal with a<br>
predetermined amplitude statistic, a quantization with the<br>
smallest possible error (which is typically measured as an<br>
error behavior, or error energy) may be achieved. In<br>
contrast to the above-described non-linear quantization,<br>
wherein the magnitude of the quantization levels is<br>
substantially proportional to the associated signal value,<br>
the quantizer must be readjusted to each signal in the<br>
signal-adapted quantization, unless it is assumed that<br>
several signals have very similar amplitude statistics.<br>
A signal-adapted quantization of the feature vectors may<br>
also be effected by quantizing the vector components with<br>
an adjusted vector quantizer. Thus, an existing correlation<br>
between the components is also implicitly taken into<br>
account.<br>
Instead of performing a direct vector quantization, it is<br>
also possible to subject the vectors to a linear<br><br>
transformation prior to the quantization. This<br>
transformation is preferably configured such that a maximum<br>
de-correlation of the transformed vector components is<br>
ensured. Such a transformation may be calculated as a main-<br>
axis transformation. In this operation, the signal energy<br>
is typically concentrated in the first transformed<br>
components, so that the last values may be ignored. This<br>
corresponds to a reduction of dimensions. The transformed<br>
vectors are subsequently subjected to scalar quantization.<br>
This is preferably done in a manner which is signal-adapted<br>
for all components.<br>
Thus, an embodiment of an apparatus has been described<br>
which assists in producing a fingerprint signal from an<br>
audio signal. A major advantage of the apparatus presented<br>
is constituted, on the one hand, by the high robustness,<br>
which allows an ability to identify GSM-coded audio<br>
signals, and, on the other hand, by the small sizes of the<br>
signatures. Signatures may be produced a rate of about<br>
1 kByte per minute of audio material. With an average song<br>
length of about 4 minutes, this results in a signature size<br>
of 4 kByte per song. This compactness allows, among other<br>
things, to increase the number of reference signatures in<br>
the main memory of an individual computer. Thus, one<br>
million reference signatures may be readily accommodated in<br>
the main memory on newer computers.<br>
The embodiment described with regard to Fig. 2 represents a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. However, it<br>
is possible to make a large variety of changes without<br>
departing from the essential idea of the invention.<br>
A number of different means may be used for determining the<br>
energies in the frequency bands. The MPEG-7 front end 34<br>
may be replaced by any other apparatus as long as it is<br>
ensured that the energy values are available at their<br>
output in several frequency bands in the segments of an<br>
audio signal. Here, the classification of the frequency<br><br>
bands may be changed, in particular. Instead of a<br>
logarithmic band classification, any band classification<br>
may be used, it being preferable to use a band<br>
classification which is adapted to human hearing. The<br>
length of the segments into which the audio signal is<br>
divided may also be varied. In order to keep the data rate<br>
small, segment lengths of at least 10 ms are preferred.<br>
A variety of methods are available for scaling the energy<br>
values in the frequency bands. Instead of taking the<br>
logarithm of the spectral band energies, as set forth in<br>
the above embodiment, followed by high-pass filtering, the<br>
approximate logarithm may be taken, for example. In<br>
addition, the range of values of the initial values of the<br>
means for taking the logarithm may be limited. This affords<br>
the benefit that, in particular with very small energy<br>
values, the result of taking the logarithm is in a limited<br>
range of values. In particular, the means 7 0 for taking the<br>
logarithm may also be replaced by a means which is adapted<br>
even better to the loudness perception of humans. Such an<br>
improved means may take into account, in particular, the<br>
lower hearing threshold of humans as well as the subjective<br>
loudness perception.<br>
In addition, the spectral band energies may be normalized<br>
by the overall energy. In such an embodiment, the energy<br>
values in the individual frequency bands are divided by a<br>
normalization factor, which is either a measure of the<br>
total energy of the spectrum or of the total energy of the<br>
bands considered. In this form of normalization, no more<br>
high-pass filtering needs to be performed, and it is not<br>
necessary to take the logarithm. On the contrary, the total<br>
energy in each segment is constant. Such an approach is<br>
advantageous in particular if only very little mean energy<br>
exists in individual frequency bands. Such a normalization<br>
method obtains the ratio of the energies in different<br>
bands. With some audio signals this may represent an<br>
important feature, and it is advantageous to obtain the<br><br>
feature. A decision as to which type of normalization is<br>
expedient may be made as a result of an uncorrupted audio<br>
signal, i.e. of an audio signal which is not distorted with<br>
regard to the frequency response. The normalization of the<br>
spectral band energies by the total energy has been<br>
proposed, e.g., in Y. Wang, Z. Liu and J.C. Huang:<br>
"Multimedia Content Analysis", IEEE Signal Processing<br>
Magazine, 2000.<br>
It is also possible to perform local spectral<br>
normalization. A normalization of this kind has been<br>
described in J. Soo Seo, J. Haitsma and T. Kalker: "Linear<br>
Speed-change Resilient Audio Fingerprinting", Proceedings<br>
1st IEEE Benelux Workshop on Model Based Processing and<br>
Coding of Audio", Leuven, Belgium, 2002.<br>
Various methods may be employed for temporal smoothing of<br>
the energy values in successive segments. In the above-<br>
described embodiment, a digital low-pass filter is used. In<br>
addition, it is also possible to calculate modulation<br>
spectra for the energy values. Here, low-frequency<br>
modulation coefficients describe the smoothed course of the<br>
spectral energy values. The use of modulation spectra for<br>
audio recognition has been described, e.g., by S.<br>
Sukittanon and L. Atlas: "Modulation Frequency Features for<br>
Audio Fingerprinting", IEEE ICASSP 2002, pp. 1773-1776,<br>
Orlando, Florida, USA, 2002. In comparison, smoothing of<br>
the temporal course of the energy values in successive<br>
segments is made possible by calculating a sliding mean<br>
value. Thus, a mean value is calculated from a specific<br>
number of successive features. In the MPEG-7 standard,<br>
e.g., this is made possible by the "scalable series". This<br>
type of smoothing, however, has the drawback that it may<br>
entail aliasing, in the context of signal theory. This<br>
effect, however, may be suppressed, for the most part, by a<br>
suitably dimensioned low-pass filter.<br><br>
In addition, it is possible to dispense with the decimation<br>
stage. This is useful, in particular, if the segments of<br>
the audio signal which have been processed are very long.<br>
In this case, the data rate is already sufficiently small<br>
by itself, and no more decimation is required. The<br>
advantage of such an arrangement is that in the entire<br>
apparatus, the same data rate applies for deriving a<br>
fingerprint from the spectral energy values. This<br>
facilitates a technical implementation, in particular in<br>
the form of a computer program.<br>
The high-pass filter 80 may vary within a broad range. A<br>
very simple embodiment consists in using the differences of<br>
two successive values, respectively. Such an embodiment has<br>
the advantage that it is very simple to realize from a<br>
technical point of view.<br>
Means 84 for quantizing may be modified within a broad<br>
range. It is not absolutely necessary and may be dispensed<br>
with in an embodiment. This reduces the expense incurred in<br>
the implementation of the inventive apparatus. On the other<br>
hand, in a further embodiment, a quantizing means may be<br>
used which is adapted to the signal and wherein the<br>
quantization intervals are adapted to the amplitude<br>
statistics of a signal. Thus, the quantization error for a<br>
signal becomes minimal. A vector quantization may also be<br>
adapted to the signal and/or may be combined with a linear<br>
transform.<br>
In addition, it is possible to combine the quantizing means<br>
with an apparatus for high-pass filtering and/or for<br>
forming differences. In many cases, a formation of<br>
differences reduces the range of values of the signals to<br>
be quantized. Changes in the energy values are emphasized,<br>
signals constant in time are made to be zero. If a signal<br>
exhibits nearly unchanged values in a sufficiently large<br>
number of segments successive in time, the difference is<br>
approximately zero. Accordingly, the output signal of the<br><br>
quantizer is also zero. If coding the quantized signals is<br>
effected using an entropy code wherein a short symbol is<br>
associated with frequently occurring signal values, the<br>
waveform may be stored with a minimum ' outlay in terms of<br>
storage space.<br>
In a further embodiment, the scalar quantizers individually<br>
quantizing the energy values processed for each frequency<br>
band may be replaced by a vector quantizer. Such a vector<br>
quantizer associates an integer index value with a vector<br>
which includes the processed energy value in the frequency<br>
bands used (e.g. in four frequency bands) . The result for<br>
each vector of energy values is now only a scalar value.<br>
Thus, the amount of data at hand is smaller than with the<br>
separate quantization of the energy values in the frequency<br>
bands, since correlations within the vectors are taken into<br>
account.<br>
In addition, a form of quantization may be used wherein the<br>
widths of quantization levels is larger for large energy<br>
values than for small energy values. The result is that<br>
even small signals may be quantized with a satisfactory<br>
resolution. It is possible, in particular, to design the<br>
quantizing means such that the maximum relative<br>
quantization error of roughly the same magnitude for small<br>
and large energy values.<br>
In addition, in another embodiment, the order of the<br>
processing means may be changed. In particular, means that<br>
cause linear processing of the energy values may be<br>
exchanged. However, it is expedient for a decimation means<br>
which may be present to be arranged immediately downstream<br>
of a low-pass filter. Such a combination of low-pass<br>
filtering and decimation is useful, since disturbing<br>
influences due to under-sampling may be avoided most<br>
effectively. Moreover, a high-pass filter must be arranged<br>
downstream of the means for taking the logarithm in order<br><br>
to be able to suppress the steady component that may result<br>
when taking the logarithm.<br>
The inventive apparatus for producing a fingerprint signal<br>
from an audio signal may be employed advantageously for<br>
establishing and operating an audio database.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a method for<br>
establishing a database. What is described here is the<br>
approach to producing a new data set on the grounds of an<br>
audio signal. Once the process has started, the first free<br>
data set is initially searched for. Subsequently, a search<br>
is made whether an audio signal is present for processing.<br>
If this is so, a fingerprint signal associated with the<br>
audio signal is produced and stored in the database. If,<br>
additionally, there is still information (so-called<br>
metadata) about the audio signal, it is also stored into<br>
the database, and a cross-reference to the fingerprint is<br>
made. Here, storing of a data set is completed. In the<br>
database application, a pointer is then set to the nearest<br>
free data set. If further audio signals are to be<br>
processed, the process described above is cycled through<br>
several times. If there are no more audio signals to be<br>
processed, the process is terminated.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a process for<br>
obtaining information on the grounds of an audio-signal<br>
database. It is the aim of this process to obtain<br>
information about a predefined search audio signal from a<br>
database. In a first step, a search fingerprint is produced<br>
from the search audio signal. For this purpose, an<br>
apparatus and/or a method in accordance with the present<br>
invention is employed. Subsequently, the data-set pointer<br>
of the database is directed at the first data set to be<br>
browsed. The fingerprint signal for a database entry, which<br>
signal is stored in the database, is then read out from the<br>
database. On the grounds of the search fingerprint signal<br>
and the read-out fingerprint signal of the current database<br><br>
entry, a statement is now made about the similarity of the<br>
audio signals. If further data sets are to be processed,<br>
reading out the fingerprint signal and comparing it with<br>
the search fingerprint signal is repeated for the further<br>
dafa sets. If all data sets to be browsed have been<br>
processed, a statement is made about the result of the<br>
search, wherein the statements made for each of the data<br>
sets to be browsed are taken into account.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the inventive method for<br>
browsing an audio-signal database is expanded to include<br>
outputting of meta-information belonging to the audio<br>
signal. This is useful, for example, in connection with<br>
pieces of music. By means of a given portion of a music<br>
title, a database may be browsed using the described<br>
method. Once a sufficient similarity of the unknown music<br>
title with a music title captured in the database is<br>
recognized, the metadata stored in the database may be<br>
output. This data may include, e.g., the title and<br>
performer of the piece of music, information about the<br>
album containing the title, as well as information about<br>
supply sources and copyrights. Thus it is possible to<br>
obtain all information required about a piece of music on<br>
the basis of a portion thereof.<br>
In an expansion of the method described, the database may<br>
also contain the actual music data. Thus, the entire piece<br>
of music may be delivered back starting from the knowledge<br>
of a portion of the music.<br>
The above-described method for operating an audio database<br>
is, of course, not restricted to pieces of music. On the<br>
contrary, all kinds of natural or technical sounds may be<br>
classified accordingly. An audio database based on an<br>
inventive method may thus deliver back corresponding<br>
metadata and enable the recognition of a large variety of<br>
acoustic signals.<br><br>
The methods for establishing and operating an audio-signal<br>
database which have been described with reference to Figs.<br>
3 and 4 differ from conventional databases substantially in<br>
the manner in which a fingerprint signal is produced. The<br>
inventive method for producing a fingerprint signal enables<br>
the generation of a fingerprint signal which is very robust<br>
against disturbing influences, on the basis of the content<br>
of an audio signal. Thus, the recognition of an audio<br>
signal that has previously been stored into the database is<br>
possible with a high level of reliability even if the audio<br>
signal used for comparison has disturbances superimposed on<br>
it or is distorted in its frequency response. In addition,<br>
the magnitude of an inventive fingerprint signal is only<br>
about 4 kByte per song. This compactness affords the<br>
benefit that the number of reference signatures in the main<br>
memory of a single computer is increased as compared with<br>
other methods. A million fingerprint signals may be<br>
accommodated in the main memory on a modern computer. Thus,<br>
the search for an audio signal is not only very reliable<br>
but may also be performed in a very fast and resource-<br>
efficient manner.<br>
The processes described with reference to Figs. 3 and 4 may<br>
be varied within a broad range. In particular, any method<br>
suitable for establishing and operating a database may be<br>
employed, as long as it is ensured that the inventive<br>
fingerprint signal is used. It is feasible, for example in<br>
individual solutions, to produce the fingerprint signal<br>
from the database not until it is actually required. This<br>
is advantageous if an audio database fulfils several tasks<br>
at once and if the comparison of two audio signals is<br>
required only as an exception. Moreover, additional search<br>
criteria may readily be included. In addition, it is<br>
possible to associate entries of the database with a class<br>
of similar audio signals on the grounds of the fingerprint<br>
signal, and to store the information about the association<br>
with a class in the database.<br><br>
The present invention thus provides an apparatus and a<br>
method for producing a fingerprint signal from an audio<br>
signal, as well as apparatus and methods which allow an<br>
audio signal to be characterized, and/or a database to be<br>
established and operated, on the grounds of this<br>
fingerprint. Here, the production of the fingerprint signal<br>
takes into account both the aspects relevant for technical<br>
realization and a low expense in terms of implementation, a<br>
small magnitude of the fingerprint signal and a robustness<br>
against disturbances as well as psycho-acoustics phenomena.<br>
The result is a fingerprint signal which is very small in<br>
relation to the data volume and which characterizes the<br>
content of an audio signal and enables the audio signal to<br>
be recognized with a high level of reliability. The use of<br>
the fingerprint signal is suitable both for classifying an<br>
audio signal and for database applications.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method for<br>
producing a fingerprint signal from an audio signal may be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
may be effected on a digital storage medium, in particular<br>
a disc or CD with electronically readable control signals<br>
which may cooperate with a programmable computer system<br>
such that the corresponding process is executed. Generally,<br>
the invention thus also consists in a computer-program<br>
product with a program code, stored on a machine-readable<br>
carrier, for performing the inventive method if the<br>
computer-program product runs on a computer. In other<br>
words, the invention may thus also be realized as a<br>
computer program with a program code for performing the<br>
method when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>
In addition, the present invention may also be developed<br>
further through a number of detail improvements.<br>
In an embodiment, a segment of the audio signal has a<br>
length in time of at least 10 ms. Such a configuration<br>
reduces the number of energy values to be formed in the<br><br>
individual frequency bands in comparison with methods using<br>
a shorter segment length. The amount of data at hand is<br>
smaller, and subsequent processing of the data requires<br>
less expense. It has been found, however, that a segment<br>
length of about 20 ms is sufficiently small with regard to<br>
human perception. Shorter audio components in a frequency<br>
band do not occur in typical audio signals and hardly<br>
contribute to human perception of audio-signal content.<br>
In one embodiment, the means for scaling is designed to<br>
compress a range of values of the energy values so that a<br>
range of values of compressed energy values is smaller than<br>
a range of values of non-compressed energy values. Such an<br>
embodiment provides the advantage that the dynamic range of<br>
the energy values is reduced. This allows a so-called<br>
number representation. Thereby, in particular, the need to<br>
use a floating-point representation is avoided. In<br>
addition, such an approach takes into account a dynamic<br>
compression which also takes place in the human ear.<br>
In a further embodiment, scaling may go hand in hand with<br>
normalizing the energy values. If a normalization is<br>
performed, the dependence of the energy values on the<br>
control-recording level of the audio signal is eliminated.<br>
This substantially corresponds to the ability of human<br>
hearing to adapt to loud and soft signals alike and to<br>
ascertain the correspondence, in terms of content, between<br>
two audio signals independently of the current playback<br>
volume.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment it is either possible to<br>
restrict the range of values to an interval between a lower<br>
limit and an upper limit, or to take the logarithm of the<br>
energy values. Both approaches lead to robust fingerprints<br>
of an audio signal. Taking the logarithm here is more<br>
closely related to the properties of human auditory<br>
perception.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the means for scaling is configured to<br>
scale the energy values in accordance with the human<br>
loudness perception. Such an approach affords the benefit<br>
that both soft and loud signals are assessed very precisely<br>
in accordance with the perceptive faculty of humans.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the means for<br>
scaling the energy values is configured to scale the energy<br>
values band by band. The scaling on a band-by-band basis<br>
here corresponds to the ability of humans to recognize an<br>
audio signal even if it distorted in relation to the<br>
frequency response.<br>
In one embodiment, a steady component is suppressed by a<br>
high-pass filter connected downstream of the means for<br>
taking the logarithm. This allows achieving identical<br>
control-recording levels in all frequency bands within a<br>
predetermined range of tolerance. The range of tolerance<br>
admissible for evaluating the spectral energy values here<br>
is about ± 3 db.<br>
In a further embodiment, the means for scaling is<br>
configured to perform a normalization of the energy value<br>
by the total energy. By means of such an arrangement, the<br>
dependence on the signal level may be eliminated, just like<br>
in the band-by-band normalization.<br>
In a further embodiment, the means for temporal filtering<br>
of the sequence of scaled vectors includes a means<br>
configured to achieve temporal smoothing of the sequence of<br>
scale vectors. This is advantageous since disturbances on<br>
the audio signal mostly result in a fast change of the<br>
energy values in the individual frequency bands. In<br>
comparison therewith, information-bearing components mostly<br>
change at a lower rate. This is due to the characteristic<br>
of audio signals which represent, in particular, a piece of<br>
music.<br><br>
The means for temporal smoothing of the sequence of scaled<br>
vectors is, in one embodiment, a low-pass filter with a<br>
cutoff frequency of less than 10 Hz. Such a dimensioning is<br>
based on the findings that the information-bearing features<br>
of a voice or music signal change at a comparatively low<br>
rate, i.e. on a time scale of more than 100 ras.<br>
In a further embodiment, the means for temporal filtering<br>
of the sequence of scale vectors includes a means for<br>
forming the difference between two energy values successive<br>
in time. This is an efficient implementation of a high-pass<br>
filter.<br>
In a further embodiment, the apparatus for producing a<br>
fingerprint signal from an audio signal comprises a low-<br>
pass filter as well as a decimation means connected to the<br>
output of the low-pass filter. The decimation means is<br>
configured to reduce the number of vectors derived from the<br>
audio signal such that a Nyquist criterion is met. Such an<br>
embodiment, in turn, is based on the findings that only<br>
temporally slow changes of the energy values in the<br>
individual frequency bands have a high information content<br>
concerning the audio signal to be classified. Accordingly,<br>
fast changes of the energy values may be suppressed by a<br>
low-pass filter. Thus, the sequence of energy values only<br>
has low-frequency components for a frequency band.<br>
Accordingly, a reduction of the sampling rate is possible<br>
in accordance with the sampling theorem. After the<br>
decimation, the scaled and filtered sequence of vectors<br>
only has one vector per D segments instead of, originally,<br>
one vector per segment. Here, D is the decimation factor.<br>
The consequence of such an approach is a reduction of the<br>
data rate of the fingerprint signal. Thus, the removal of<br>
redundant information may, at the same time, be combined<br>
with a reduction of the amount of data. Such an approach<br>
reduces the magnitude of the resulting fingerprint of a<br>
given audio signal and thus contributes to efficient<br>
utilization of the inventive apparatus.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the inventive apparatus includes a<br>
means for quantizing. Thus it is possible to effect, in<br>
addition to scaling, a second conversion of the range of<br>
values of the energy values.<br>
In a further embodiment, a high-pass filter is connected<br>
upstream of the means for quantizing, the high-pass filter<br>
being configured to reduce the amounts of the values to be<br>
quantized. This allows a reduction of the number of bits<br>
required for representing these values in a non-signal-<br>
adapted quantizer. Thus, the data rate is reduced. In a<br>
signal-adapted quantizer, the number of bits does not<br>
depend on the amounts of the values to be quantized.<br>
In addition, entropy coding is preferred. This involves<br>
associating short code words with frequently occurring<br>
values, whereas long code words are associated with rarely<br>
occurring values. The result is a further reduction of the<br>
amount of data.<br>
In a further embodiment, the means for quantizing may be<br>
configured such that the width of quantization levels is<br>
larger for large energy values than for small energy<br>
values. This, too, entails a reduction of the number of<br>
bits required for representing an energy value, very small<br>
signals continuing to be represented with sufficient<br>
accuracy.<br>
In one embodiment, in particular, the means for quantizing<br>
may be configured such that the maximum relative<br>
quantization error is the same for large and small energy<br>
values within a tolerance range. The relative quantization<br>
error is defined, for example, as the ratio of the absolute<br>
quantization error for an energy value and the un-quantized<br>
energy value. The maximum is formed .in a quantizing<br>
interval. An interval of +/-3db about a predefined value<br>
may be used as the tolerance range. The maximum relative<br><br>
quantization error also depends on the bit width of the<br>
quantizer.<br>
The embodiment described represents an example of signal-<br>
adapted quantizing. In the field of signal processing,<br>
however, a variety of additional forms of signal-adapted<br>
quantizing are known. In the inventive apparatus, any of<br>
the embodiments may be employed as long as it is ensured<br>
that it is adapted to the statistical properties of the<br>
energy values filtered.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the means for quantizing may be<br>
configured such that the width of quantization levels is<br>
larger for rare energy values than for frequent energy<br>
values. This, too, entails a reduction of the number of<br>
bits required for representing an energy value, and/or a<br>
smaller quantization error.<br>
In a further embodiment, the means for quantizing is<br>
configured such that it associates a symbol with a vector<br>
of energy values processed. This symbol represents a vector<br>
quantizer. With the help of such a vector quantizer, a<br>
further reduction of the amount of data is made possible.<br>
Finally it is to be stated that the inventive apparatus<br>
and/or and inventive method comprise a very broad field of<br>
application. In particular, the above-described concept for<br>
producing a fingerprint may be employed in pattern-<br>
recognizing systems so as to identify or to characterize<br>
signals. In addition, the concept may also be used in<br>
connection with methods determining similarities and/or<br>
distances between data sets. These may be database<br>
applications, for example.<br><br>
