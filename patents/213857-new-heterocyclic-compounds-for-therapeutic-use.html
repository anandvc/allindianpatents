TITLE:<br>
NEW HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS FOR THERAPEUTIC USE<br>
RELATED APPLICATION :-<br>
This application claims priority from 15.03.2001 on the basis of U.S.Patent Application No.09/809,485.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION :-<br>
The present invention relates to new heterocyclic compounds of the general formula 1 and 2 for therapeutic use.<br>
The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the general formula 1 and 2, process for preparing the same and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having a selective action on inflammation and its related disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are compounds used mainly in the relief of pain , inflammation , and sometimes fever.<br>
The combined analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of NSAIDS make them particularly useful for the symptomatic relief of painful and/ or inflammatory conditions including musculoskeletal and joint disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylo arthopathic, peri-articular and soft tissue disorder.<br>
NSAIDS have shown to be useful in alleviating symptoms of inflammation and pain disorders. Prostaglandins (PGs) are ubiquitous fatty acid derivatives that serve as autocrine / paracrine mediators involved in many different physiological processes in addition to their well recognized role in inflammation and immune response modulation. Prostaglandins elicit a variety of important and beneficial responses. Among the undesirable properties of Prostaglandins is their ability to induce pain, fever, and symptoms associated with the inflammatory response.<br>
NSAIDS exert their actions primarily by inhibiting the production of PGs. Recent studies of inflammatory processes has led to the identification of the key enzyme cycloxygenase (Cox) that is expressed in inflammatory conditions. Various studies on the identification of Cox-2 enzyme are reported:-Vane , J.R. ; Nature 1994 , Made , E.A.., Smith W. L. ., Dewitt, D.L ; J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268: 6610-14<br>
Cox is the first enzyme in the prostanoid biosynthetic pathway catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2 as the first step in the synthesis of PGs, Prostacyclins, and Thromboxane, all of which act as important mediators of biological and inflammatory responses. Pairet, M., Engekelhardt.G ; Fundam . Clin. Pharmacol 1996, 10 ,1-15<br>
The discovery of second inducible isoenzyme has enabled the identification of two major isoforms of COX: the constitutive COX isoform , termed Cox-1 and the inducible isoform , termed the Cox-2 .There are now various theories supporting the fact that the inducible Cox-2 enzyme is responsible for the production of inflammatory mediators. Drugs of Future 1998.23. 598-601.<br><br>
The commonest side effects occurring during therapy with NSAIDS are generally gastrointestinal disturbances, these are usually mild and reversible but in some patients, peptic ulcer and severe gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported. These adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract may be associated with the inhiibition of the form of cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox-1). NSAIDS that are highly selective inhibitors of the form cycloxygenase -2 ( Cox-2) may have less gastrointestinal toxicity, hence, interest has developed in NSAIDS that are highly selective inhibitors of Cox-2 , such as Meloxicam, Nimesulide, Rofecoxib and the like.<br>
Most widely used NSAIDS like Diclofenac , Flufenamic acid, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin and the like, inhibit both the forms of the enzymes (Cox-1 and Cox-2) with many showing selectivity for Cox-1 enzyme.<br>
Inhibition of COX -1 enzyme causes the common gastrointestina] side affects as seen in the known NSAIDS like Diclofenac , Flufenamic acid, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin and the like. All these antiinflammatory agents have shown undesirable side effects.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new pyrazole derivatives and their pharmaceutical compositions as well as their therapeutic uses and the processes for preparing the same.<br>
At present there is a pharmacoepial dogma establishing a mandator/ connection between anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, other therapeutic uses and the side effects mainly, gastrointestinal disturbances caused by the known NSAIDS. This dogma and the constant need has instigated the inventors to develop a newly synthesized anti-inflammatory compounds showing antimicrobial and antipyretic activity with less side effects. The pyrazole class has shown a promising drug like Celecoxib. The description of various pyrazole derivatives has been disclosed in US patent 5,521207, J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40 , 1347-1365<br>
Pyrazoles have been described for use in the treatment of inflammation U. S. Pat. no. 5,134,142 to Matsuo et al describes 1,5- diaryl pyrzoles and specificaiiy ,1-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3-trifluoromethyl pyrazole, as having anti inflammatory activity.<br>
In view of the extensive studies on the above derivatives, the inventors have discovered new compounds of diarylpyrazole class having more advantageous properties and the manufacturing process for the said new pyrazole derivatives fulfilling the desirable features as described herein under.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :-<br>
The present invention relates to new NSAIDS compounds having Diao'Ipyrazole ring of the general formula 1 and formula 2, their synthesis and their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts having a antiinflammatory, antipyretic, or antibacterial activity.<br>
The present invention also relates to synthesis of the intermediates (substituted diketo compounds ) of the compounds of general formula 1 :<br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
The test compounds of formula 1 and 2 were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity and ulcerogenic activity.<br>
Wistar rats (120-180 gms ) were fasted overnight and were given per oral either vehicle ( 1% sodium CMC in water) or a test compound. The paw volume was measured using a Plethysmometer, (UGO- Basile Italy) based on the principal of water displacement. The animals were then injected subcutaneously with 0.1 ml of 1 % w/v of Carrageenan suspension in to the plantar tissue of the right hind paw. The paw volume was measured at 0 hour and subsequently at 1 hour intervals upto 6 hours. The percent increase in the paw volume was compared with the test compound and control. The difference of the average values between treated and control groups was calculated for each time interval and statistically evaluated. The animals were sacrificed and the stomach of each animal was removed , a longitudinal incision along the greater curvature was made and the presence and absence of gastric irritation was determined. All the treatment groups were coded to eliminate observer's bias. The results incicate that some of the test compounds exhibits anti-inflammatory activity comparable with known NSAIDS and these compounds also revealed mild injury which was significantiy less than the ulcerogenic index of standard NSAID known to cause gastric lesions.<br>
It is to be understood that various modifications or changes that Wiay be made to that described herein above by those of ordinary skill in the art are also contemplated by the present invention and are to be included v/ithin the spirit and pur/iew of this application and the following claims :<br>
