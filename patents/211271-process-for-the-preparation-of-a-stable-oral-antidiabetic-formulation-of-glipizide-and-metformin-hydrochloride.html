TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Process for the preparation of a stable oral antidiabetic formulation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride.<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Name: USV Limited Nationality:   Indian Address : BSD Marg, Govandi,<br>
Mumbai 400088, Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention  relates  to   a process for the preparation  of   stable oral antidiabetic   formulation  of glipizide and metformin  hydrochloride.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Glipizide is an oral antihyperglycemic drug of sulfonylurea class used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes ie non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Glipizide has the chemical name l-cyclohexyl-3-[[p-[2-(5-methylpyrazinecarboxamido) ethyl]phenyl] sulfonyl] urea, molecular formula C21H27N5O4S and molecular weight 445.55. Glipizide has a pKa of 5.9 and is insoluble in water and alcohol but soluble in 0. IN NaOH. Metformin hydrochloride is a biguanide class of oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Metformin hydrochloride whose chemical name is (N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide mono-hydrochloride) is not chemically or pharmacologically related to sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, or α-glucosidase inhibitors. It has a molecular formula of C4H12C1N5 (monohydrochloride) and a molecular weight of 165.63. Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone, ether and chloroform. Metformin has a pKa of 12.4. Glipizide is known to lower blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of<br><br>
insulin from the pancreas, whereas metformin hydrochloride is known to improve glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.<br>
US Patent No 6,011,049 describes the use of a combination of a glitazone antidiabetic agent and a biguanide antidiabetic agent and optionally a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent for treating diabetes mellitus and improving glycemic control. Glipizide being a sulfonylurea class is sensitive to degradation in the presence of acidic compounds like metformin hydrochloride with generation of impurities, mainly "Glipizide Related Compound A" chemically known as [N-{2-[(4-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]ethyl}-5-methyl-pyrazinecarboxamide]. Degradation of glipizide is more pronounced at higher storage temperature because of which a high limit of 2% of impurity is allowed for Glipizide tablet in United States Pharmacopoeia 2003 (USP 26, page no. 859). Glipizide and metformin HC1 Tablets of Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA recently marketed under the brand name "Metalglip" are advised to be stored at low temperatures like 20°C - 25°C. In tropical countries like India the average temperature at most of the places most of the time is around 30°C. Therefore such drugs are likely to show pronounced degradation at such tropical climatic conditions. The "Metalglip" tablets comprise plain glipizide.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a stable oral antidiabetic formulation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride having improved storage life even at high temperatures.<br>
Another object     of   the invention   is   to     provide     a	stable     oral   antidiabetic<br>

life even at high temperatures which is suitable for use	in tropical conditions like<br>
in India.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a stable oral antidiabetic formulation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride having improved  storage life even at  high temperatures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a stable oral antidiabetic formulation of 2.5 to 40 mg glipizide and 250 to 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, wherein the glipizide is in the form of an inclusion complex  with  cyclodextrin and non-ionic surfactant.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided process for the preparation of a stable oral antidiabetic formulation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride comprising dry mixing 250 - 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride and inclusion complex of 2.5 - 40 mg glipizide with cyclodextrin and non-ionic surfactant and excipients and optionally converting the formulation into solid dosage forms in known manner.<br>
The inclusion complex of glipizide may be prepared in accordance with the procedure described in our US Patent No. 6,464,988B1. The term cyclodextrin includes its derivatives and may be alpha cyclodextrin, beta cyclodextrin, gamma cyclodextrin, or alkyl or hydroxy alkyl derivatives thereof. Preferably cyclodextrin may be beta cyclodextrin, gamma cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin and/or randomly methylated beta cyclodextrin. The non-ionic surfactant may be any pharmaceutically acceptable  non-ionic   surfactant  such  as  polyoxyl  nonionic   surfactant,  preferably<br><br>
polyoxyl-40-castor oil, polyoxyethylene-20-stearyl ether, polyoxyl-35-castor oil, polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan monooleate or polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan monolaurate.<br>
Immediate release form of metformin hydrochloride may be prepared by techniques commonly known in the art. Sustained release form of metformin hydrochloride may be prepared in accordance with the process described in our PCT publication No. WO 02/28181 Al or any other process known in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include excipients commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations and may be, for example, diluents, such as lactose, maltodextrin, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, starch or sucrose, binders such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, starch, gelatin or acacia, glidants or lubricants such as colloidal silicone dioxide, talc, glyceryl behenate, magnesium stearate or hydrogenated vegetable oil or disintegrants such as sodium starch glycolate, crosspovidone, cross carmellose sodium or starch alginic acid.<br>
The solid dosage forms may be tablets optionally film coated, capsules or dry powder formulated in known manner. The tablets may be single layer tablets or bilayer tablets comprising a first layer of sustained release metformin granules optionally<br><br>
mixed with excepients and a second layer of mixture of glipizide-cyclodextrin inclusion complex with excepients.<br>
The inclusion complex of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride may be dry mixed in granular  forms prepared in known manner.<br>

- 60°C to get solid inclusion complex of glipizide with beta cyclodextrin and polyoxyl-40-castor oil.<br>
300 gm of starch was mixed with 350 gm purified water and the slurry was added to 1380 ml of hot water (heated to 80 - 90°C) to form starch paste. 10000 gm of metformin hydrochloride, 100 gm of sodium starch glycolate and 940 gm of microcrystalline cellulose were mixed and granulated. The starch paste was added to the granules and the wet mass was further granulated. The granules of metformin hydrochloride in immediate release  form were dried and sized by using 16-mesh sieve.<br>

Stability study:<br>
Stability studies of tablets of Examples 1,6, 11 and 14 were carried out to evaluate degradation of glipizide and generation of impurities, mainly "glipizide impurity A" chemically known as [N-{2-[(4-aminosulfonyl)phenyl]ethyl}-5-methyl-pyrazinecarboxamide] over prolonged storage at room temperature and at higher temperatures. The impurity analysis was done using the gradient HPLC (High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) system equipped with 250 X 4.6 mm, C18, 5 μm column and mobile phase of NaH2P04 buffer pH 6.0 : THF (500 :10) with Methanol and UV detector to estimate the percentage of impurity generation. The results were as shown in the following Tables:<br><br>

The Tables 1 to 3 clearly establish that the percentagesof impurities generated over prolonged storage at room temperature and accelerated temperature are significantly reduced in case of the tablets of Examples 1,6 and 11 containing inclusion complex of glipizide with cyclodextrin and non-ionic surfactant as compared to the tablets of Example 14 containing plain glipizide. Table 3 also shows in the case of tablets of Example 14 maximum rise in impurity to about 2.156 % at 40°C with 75% humidity.<br><br>
According to the invention degradation of glipizide and generation of impurities is thus significantly reduced thereby imparting stability to the tablets over a long storage period even at high temperature. Therefore, the tablets of the invention are also suitable for use in tropical conditions like in India. The process of the invention involves simple mixing, which is easy and economical to carry out and is also suitable for carrying out on a commercial scale.<br><br>
