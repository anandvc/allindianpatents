CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of Chinese Patent Application No. 200610041802.2 filed on February 20, 2006 and entitled with "Multi-Speed Compound Vehicular Transmission Having an Auxiliary Section with Three Countershafts", which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a mechanical transmission device for a vehicle, particularly to a multi-speed compound vehicular transmission having an auxiliary section with countershafts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] An important issue in designing modern vehicular transmission systems is to improve load capacity of the mechanical transmission. The most effective design for modern mechanical transmissions of heavy vehicles is to provide several identical countershafts in the mechanical transmissions of heavy vehicles to split the power so as to improve the load capacity of the gear transmission assembly. A double-countershaft transmission successfully achieves the above purpose and has a significant share of market.<br>
[0004] A known multi-speed double-countershaft vehicular transmission with compound main section and auxiliary section includes a main section and an auxiliary section. Among which, the auxiliary section employs a double-countershaft structure, i.e., is provided with two countershafts at both side of an auxiliary section main shaft, with the two auxiliary section countershafts symmetrically and equidistantly arranged with respect to the auxiliary section main shaft and located in the same plane with the auxiliary section main shaft. When power is transmitted from the main section to the auxiliary section via a main section output shaft, a driving gear arranged on the main section output shaft engages with a driven gear arranged on the auxiliary section<br>
 <br>
countershaft, such that power is split into two parts to be respectively transmitted to the two auxiliary section countershafts. Shaft teeth on the two auxiliary section countershafts engage with teeth of gears arranged on the auxiliary section main shaft such that power may be transmitted to the auxiliary section main shaft, combined thereat, and output via the auxiliary section main shaft.<br>
[0005] As the road transportation condition is improved increasingly, the road transportation plays a more and more important role in the entire transport service. For heavy trucks, container trailers, cranes and the like, the transmission equipped therewith is expected to be able to transmit a larger torque, operate at a wider speed range, provide a more reliable performance, and manufactured with a lower cost. However, for a known double-countershaft mechanical transmission, if the input torque exceeds 2200Nm, the gear width, thus the centre distance of the transmission will be increased accordingly. Therefore, the axial size of the transmission would be increased, yielding an increased cost and a reduced reliability. Further, noise and impact will increase under a larger load, and the service life of the gear will be reduced. Therefore, the application of the known double-countershaft transmission is limited in the heavy vehicle field.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The object of the present invention is to overcome one or more defects of the prior art multi-speed compound transmission with double countershafts, and to provide a multi-speed compound structure having an auxiliary section with three countershafts which is adapted for a multi-speed compound transmission gear box requiring a larger power, higher torque and greater load capacity.<br>
[0007]     The present invention is achieved by the following technical solutions.<br>
[0008] According to one aspect of the present invention, a multi-speed compound vehicular transmission having an auxiliary section with three countershafts, comprising:<br>
a main section; and<br>
an auxiliary section, wherein<br>
[0009] the main section comprises an output shaft, a synchronizer and two countershafts symmetrically arranged on both sides of the output shaft; and<br>
the auxiliary section comprises  an auxiliary section main shaft and a<br>
 <br>
synchronizer, with a reduction gear arranged on the auxiliary section main shaft and countershafts arranged around the auxiliary section main shaft; wherein<br>
[0010] there are three countershafts arranged around the auxiliary section main shaft, the three countershafts being arranged to be parallel to each other and being distributed with equal distance around the auxiliary section main shaft;<br>
a driven gear of the auxiliary section countershaft is engaged to a driving gear;<br>
an auxiliary section countershaft gear is engaged to the reduction gear; and an output end of the auxiliary section main shaft is connected to a flange.<br>
[0011] Preferably, one of the three auxiliary section countershafts is concentric with one of the two main section countershafts.<br>
[0012] Preferably, the three auxiliary section countershafts are not concentric with respect to either of the two main section countershafts.<br>
[0013]     Preferably, the synchronizer is a lock pin synchronizer. [0014]     Preferably, the synchronizer is a lock ring synchronizer.<br>
[0015] Preferably, the synchronizer is a lock ring synchronizer with a single cone or multiple cones.<br>
[0016] Preferably, the lock ring synchronizer with multiple cones is a lock ring synchronizer with double cones or triple cones. The present invention is advantageous in that:<br>
[0017] 1. Since the number of the auxiliary section countershafts is increased from two to three, in the case that the load of the transmission is kept unchanged, the load carried by each countershaft is reduced, thus the thickness of the gears may be reduced, and the axial size of the transmission may be reduced. Further, the load capacity of the auxiliary section may be improved.<br>
[0018] 2. A three-countershaft structure is employed in the auxiliary section such that it is possible to increase the number of teeth engaging with the main shaft gear of the auxiliary section, thus to achieve a smoother transmission compared with a known auxiliary section with double countershafts, to reduce noise and impact, and to improve the life of the auxiliary section gears.<br>
