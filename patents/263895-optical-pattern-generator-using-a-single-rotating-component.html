OPTICAL PATTERN GENERATOR USING A SINGLE ROTATING COMPONENT<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) to U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 60/652,891, "High Efficiency, High Speed Optical Pattern<br>
Generator Using a Single Rotating Component," filed Feb. 14, 2005; and is a continuation-in-<br>
part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/750,790, "High Speed, High Efficiency Optical<br>
Pattern Generator Using Rotating Optical Elements," filed Dec. 31,2003. The subject matter<br>
of all of the foregoing are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	This invention relates generally to optically generating a pattern of figures such as<br>
arrays of image points, spots, or lines. More particularly, this invention relates to generating<br>
such patterns using a single rotating component that has a plurality of deflection sectors that<br>
deflect an incident optical beam by various amounts.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003]	The optical generation of a pre-defined pattern of spots or scan lines is used in a<br>
variety of applications. Digital copiers, printers, fingerprint identification, hand-held bar code<br>
scanners, industrial applications, light show entertainment, displays, telecommunications<br>
switching and medical applications are a few examples. Perhaps the most common<br>
mechanisms for generating patterns of figures are tilting mirrors (e.g., oscillating mirrors<br>
driven by galvanometers) and reflections from rotating convex polygons.<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
[0004] However, optical pattern generators based on tilting mirrors typically have<br>
characteristics that make them unsuitable for certain applications. For example, scanning in<br>
these systems is typically achieved by tilting a mirror back and forth. But back and forth<br>
motion requires that the mirror come to a stop and then reverse direction. This takes time,<br>
which limits the scan rate. In order to increase the scan rate of these systems, the mirror often<br>
is driven with an oscillating motion at a rate that is near its resonant frequency. However, this<br>
severely restricts the patterns that can be generated. For example, it is difficult to generate<br>
irregular patterns since the mirror motion is constrained to be oscillatory. The near-resonance<br>
condition also limits the range of scan rates that can be achieved. For example, it is difficult to<br>
tune such a system over a wide range of scan rates since the near-resonance condition cannot<br>
be met over a wide range. In addition, the angular scan velocity of resonant scanners is usually<br>
sinusoidal and not suitable for a large number of applications where dwell time at each point<br>
must be reasonable constant.<br>
[0005] If a two-dimensional pattern is desired (e.g., a series of parallel scan lines or a<br>
two-dimensional pattern of spots), then typically either a single mirror is tilted in two<br>
directions simultaneously or two coordinated, tilting mirrors are used. In many cases the<br>
efficiency of the utilization of light, such as laser light, is also important. The efficiency may<br>
be defined as the fraction of energy deposited in a desired pattern on the treatment surface<br>
compared to the total energy produced by the light source in a given period of time. If a<br>
pattern is sparse compared to the background, it is preferable to turn off the light source and<br>
scan quickly over the background, and then turn it back on when the light beam has settled<br>
over the spot to be exposed and expose the spots in the pattern in such a manner that the light<br>
source is efficiently utilized in tune. This requires an even more responsive device that can<br>
accelerate, decelerate and settle quickly. As a result of these characteristics, galvanometer-<br>
based systems and convex polygon systems are not well suited for high speed pattern<br>
generation, particularly if the pattern is an irregular or a sparse one.<br>
[0006] In the rotating polygon approach, the sides of a three-dimensional polygon are<br>
mirrored and the polygon is rotated about a center axis. As each mirrored side rotates through<br>
an incident optical beam, the optical beam is reflected to generate a point on a scan line. The<br>
rotation of each mirrored side through the optical beam produces one scan line. If all of the<br>
mirrored sides are the same (e.g., make the same pyramid angle with the base of the polygon),<br>
then the same scan line is traced over and over. If the mirrored sides are different, then<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
different scan lines can be traced as each side rotates through the optical beam. For example,<br>
by varying the pyramid angle of each side, the reflected optical beam can trace a series of scan<br>
lines.<br>
[0007] However, the rotating polygon approach also has drawbacks that make it<br>
unsuitable for certain applications. For example, systems that produce a series of scan lines<br>
can suffer from aberrations due to the rotation. In order to trace a series of scan lines, each<br>
side has a different pyramid angle that offsets the basic scan line in a direction that is<br>
perpendicular to the scan direction. However, as each side rotates through the optical beam,<br>
the orientation of the angled side is also rotated. This can cause changes in the amount of<br>
offset and/or other unwanted aberrations. One example is scan line bow. The ideal scan line<br>
is generally a straight line segment but the actual scan line is often an arc segment. The sag of<br>
the arc segment is the bow. In the case of rotating polygon scanners, sides that have non-zero<br>
pyramid angles generate bowed scan lines. The amount of bowing depends on the pyramid<br>
angle. In a polygon scanner where different pyramid angles are used to trace multiple scan<br>
lines or to generate spots at different locations, not only will each scan line be bowed, but the<br>
bow will vary from one scan line to the next. The difference between the bow of the top-most<br>
scan line and the bottom-most scan line can be significant.<br>
[0008] Scan line bow and other effects caused by rotation can cause additional problems,<br>
depending on the application. For example, in some applications, the scanning action is used<br>
to compensate for motion of the scanner relative to a target so that the optical beam ideally<br>
remains at a fixed spot on the target even though the scanner is moving relative to the target.<br>
In this case, scan line bow will cause the optical beam to move in the direction perpendicular<br>
to the scan direction. If this motion is slow compared to the dwell time of the optical beam on<br>
the target, then the bow effectively introduces an unwanted motion in the perpendicular<br>
direction. If the motion is fast relative to the dwell time of the optical beam on the target, then<br>
the bow, which is a radial deflection, when combined with the uncompensated tangential<br>
motion, effectively blurs the optical beam, increasing the spot size of the beam on the target.<br>
Typically, neither effect is desirable.<br>
[0009] Thus, there is a need for optical pattern generators than can operate at high speeds<br>
with long dwell times at each image point, particularly for the generation of irregular patterns.<br>
There is also a need for pattern generators with reduced aberrations and/or image blurring.<br>

WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by providing an<br>
optical pattern generator using a single rotating component. The rotating component includes<br>
a number of deflection sectors containing optical elements. Each sector deflects an incident<br>
optical beam by a substantially constant angle although this angle may vary from one sector to<br>
the next. The rotating component may be combined with an imaging group that produces, for<br>
example, image points, spots, or lines displaced along a line locus. The image spots can also<br>
be displaced to either side of a line, for example by introducing a tilt in the orthogonal<br>
direction.<br>
[0011] This approach can result in many advantages. The use of a single rotating<br>
component with sectors that are positioned contiguously around its periphery can provide a<br>
high radiometric efficiency. The geometry of a rotating component such as a thin disk with<br>
optical elements located on the periphery facilitates rotation at high angular velocities, thus<br>
producing image patterns at high rates of speed. The angular velocity of the rotating<br>
component combined with the pseudo-stationary angular deflection can be used to cause the<br>
individual image points, spots, or lines to deliver high radiant energy doses to a small point in<br>
the image space with high radiometric efficiency. The angular deflection is pseudo-stationary<br>
in the sense that each deflection sector produces an approximately constant angular deflection<br>
as it rotates through the incident optical beam, but each deflection sector can have a different<br>
constant angular deflection.<br>
[0012] Another advantage of a single rotating component compared to two counter-<br>
rotating components is that the synchronization between two counter-rotating components and<br>
its attendant high cost is avoided. The drive mechanism for a single rotating component is less<br>
complex than for two counter-rotating components because the angular velocity can be rapidly<br>
changed without the additional requirement of maintaining synchronism. The use of one<br>
rather than two rotating components can also reduce size and weight. The packing geometry<br>
of the optical elements can also result in a more compact rotating component, and the number<br>
of components with their attendant cost can be significantly reduced.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
[0013] In one aspect of the invention, the preferred embodiments use reflective surfaces<br>
which permit the optical pattern generator to be independent of the wavelengths of the incident<br>
optical beams and thereby permits the simultaneous identical pattern generation of several<br>
different wavelengths in applications that can benefit from this condition.<br>
[0014] In one application, a scanner produces optical patterns that consist of spots or line<br>
segments displaced along a straight line locus. Two dimensional patterns are developed by<br>
movement of the target area with respect to the pattern generator. Implementations of the<br>
present invention can utilize this "painting" concept but can also provide patterns that have a<br>
"zig-zag" image point pattern. The use of zig-zag image point patterns in certain applications<br>
has the advantage of preventing thermal interaction between neighboring image points, for<br>
example sparing biologic tissue from damage and preventing accidental cutting of biologic<br>
tissue.<br>
[0015] In certain embodiments, an optical pattern generator includes a single rotating<br>
component that has a plurality of deflection sectors arranged on the outer periphery of a<br>
rotating disk. The incident optical beam propagates in the plane of rotation for the disk. The<br>
disk presents its edge, which contains the sectors, to the incident optical beam. The sectors<br>
travel through the incident optical beam as the disk rotates. Each sector includes a pair of<br>
opposing planar mirrors which have surface normals that are also in the plane of rotation. The<br>
incident optical beam reflects from one mirror to the other mirror and subsequently exits the<br>
rotating component at a deflection angle that is roughly ninety degrees relative to the optical<br>
beam's incidence angle. The optical path through the mirrors lies primarily in the plane of the<br>
disk. This arrangement of two mirrors has the quality that the deflection angle does not change<br>
as the pair of mirrors rotates through the incident optical beam. Therefore, the pair of mirrors<br>
at the periphery of a rotating disk component will move through the incident optical beam and<br>
produce an exit optical beam that has a constant deflection angle with respect to the incident<br>
optical beam. Successive pairs of mirrors (i.e., different sectors) may have different included<br>
angles such that different pairs of mirrors can deflect the exit optical beam by different<br>
amounts. This geometry therefore produces a pseudo-stationary deflection (PSD) pattern<br>
generation.<br>
[0016] This example geometry produces an output optical beam from the rotating<br>
component that is collimated (assuming a collimated incident optical beam). The output<br>
optical beam can be presented to subsequent imaging optics at a set of selectable beam angles<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
corresponding to different sectors. The subsequent imaging optics can include a simple<br>
reflective objective that produces an image pattern that is independent of the wavelengths<br>
present in the incident beam. Refractive, diffractive, or holographic objective systems can also<br>
be used.<br>
[0017] For this embodiment, example image patterns include a series of image points<br>
displaced along an image line locus if the reflective surfaces have a tilt component in only a<br>
single direction. The image pattern can include image points displaced in a zig-zag pattern<br>
along the image line locus if the reflective surfaces also have a small tilt component in the<br>
orthogonal direction.<br>
[0018] To reduce thermal blooming or other unwanted effects due to the sequential<br>
irradiation of adjacent image points, the sectors on the rotating component can be designed<br>
such that non-neighboring points in the image pattern are sequentially irradiated without<br>
reducing the speed or radiometric efficiency of the system. Galvanometric and other pattern<br>
generators typically do not have this capability.<br>
[0019] Another embodiment uses pairs of planar mirrors arranged in a rhomboid<br>
configuration. One mirror of each pair on one side of the rotating component corresponds with<br>
a second mirror on the opposing side of the rotating component. The incident optical beam is<br>
reflected from the first mirror, passes across the center of the rotating disk component, and<br>
reflects from the second mirror of the mirror pair. The tilt angles for the mirror pairs are<br>
approximately at 45 degrees with respect to the incident or outgoing optical beams. In one<br>
embodiment, the tilt angle for each mirror of one mirror pair is at 45 degrees, and the tilt<br>
angles for other mirror pairs changes slightly such that the outgoing optical beam exits at a<br>
different angle relative to the incident beam angle. This geometry also maintains the exit beam<br>
angle invariance condition. As long as the incident beam is on a selected mirror pair, the exit<br>
beam angle is invariant with respect to rotation of the mirror pair. The exiting beams are PSD<br>
invariant as for the previous embodiment. Any combination of an even number of mirrors<br>
rotating together in a plane containing an incident optical beam can be designed to have the<br>
property of PSD pattern generation.<br>
[0020]	Other embodiments use a single rotating component where the incident optical<br>
beam originates outside the rotating component and propagates in a direction that is not in the<br>
plane of rotation for the rotating component. For example, the incident optical beam may be<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
directed onto two optical surfaces placed on a disk that presents its face to the incident optical<br>
beam.<br>
[0021] In an embodiment based on this geometry, sectors comprise two mirrors in a 'Z-<br>
folded' arrangement that causes the exit optical beam to be approximately collinear to the<br>
incident optical beam. Each sector can have a different included angle between the mirrors in<br>
the sector, such that different sectors cause different angular deflections. The two mirrors can<br>
be planar or they can be sections of larger parent surfaces of revolution such as spheres or<br>
aspheres. Angular deflection can be maintained at a nearly constant level by making the<br>
optical axes of each mirror surface coincident with the rotation axis of the disk so that rotation<br>
of the disk does not change the form of the optical surfaces presented to the incident optical<br>
beam.<br>
[0022] In yet other embodiments, a single rotating component has sectors arranged<br>
around the periphery, similar to the cylindrical section of a barrel. The incident optical beam is<br>
injected from inside the cylindrical section. These embodiments preferably use transmissive<br>
optical elements instead of reflective optical elements, but reflective surfaces can also be used<br>
for example when wavelength independence is important. Transmissive diffractive structures<br>
on the outer surface of the cylinder are the preferred optical elements.<br>
[0023]	The optical pattern generators described above can be used for various<br>
applications. For example, they can be used to deposit optical energy onto human tissue,<br>
either externally onto the skin for example or internally through various orifices. The optical<br>
energy can be used to accomplish different purposes: local heating, ablation, cutting or<br>
cauterizing for example. The devices can also be used to deposit optical energy onto other<br>
materials: metal, powders, or other industrial materials for example. Cutting, welding,<br>
ablation and marking are examples of manufacturing processes that can be implemented. The<br>
devices can also be used in laser or LED printers, optical imaging scanners, or copy machines.<br>
Other applications will be apparent.<br>
[0024]	Other aspects of the invention include methods corresponding to the devices,<br>
systems and applications described above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0038] FIG. 1A is a side view of an optical pattern generator according to the invention,<br>
where the incident optical beam 1 lies substantially in the plane of rotation of rotatable<br>
component 9. In this example, the rotating component 9 is divided into twenty nine sectors<br>
8A, 8B, 8C, etc., which are arranged in a circle centered on the rotation axis 4 of the rotating<br>
component 9. The incident optical beam 1 propagates along a direction that lies in the plane of<br>
rotation. Each sector 8 includes a pair of reflective elements (e.g., reflective surfaces 2 and 3<br>
for the sector that is currently active). The surface normals of the reflective surfaces have a<br>
substantial component in the plane of rotation. In this example, the rotating component 9<br>
includes prisms 6, 7, etc. that are arranged in a circle. The faces of the prisms are reflectively<br>
coated and the reflectively coated surfaces from adjacent prisms (e.g., reflective surfaces 2 and<br>
3 from prisms 6 and 7) form the opposing reflective surfaces for a sector. Discrete structures<br>
other than prisms can also be used and the reflective surfaces need not be planar. Small flat<br>
mirrors can be used in the place of the prism components.<br>
[0039] As the component 9 rotates, the sectors 8 rotate through the incident optical beam<br>
1. Each sector 8 deflects the incoming optical beam 1 by some angular amount. The sectors 8<br>
axe designed so that the angular deflection is approximately constant as each sector rotates<br>
through the incident optical beam 1, but the angular deflection may vary from sector to sector.<br>
In more detail, the incident optical beam 1 reflects from the first reflective surface 2 on prism<br>
6, and subsequently reflects from reflective surface 3 on prism 7 before exiting as output<br>
optical beam 5.<br>
[0040]	The two reflective surfaces 2 and 3 form a Penta mirror geometry. An even<br>
number of reflective surfaces that rotate together in the plane of the folded optical path has the<br>
property that the angular deflection is invariant with the rotation angle of the reflective<br>
surfaces. In this case, there are two reflective surfaces 2,3 and rotation of the disk 9 causes the<br>
prisms 6, 7 and their reflective surfaces 2, 3 to rotate together in the plane of the folded optical<br>
path. As a result, the output beam angle 5 does not change as the two reflective surfaces 2, 3<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
rotate through the incident optical beam 1. The reflective surfaces 2, 3 are self-compensating<br>
with respect to rotation of the disk 9. Furthermore, if the reflective surfaces 2, 3 are planar,<br>
they will also be substantially spatially invariant with respect to disk wobble.<br>
[0041] As the disk 9 rotates clockwise to the next sector 8 and the next two reflective<br>
surfaces, the angular deflection can be changed by using a different included angle between the<br>
opposing reflective surfaces. For this configuration, the beam will be deflected by an angle<br>
that is twice that of the included angle. For example, if the included angle for sector 8A is 45<br>
degrees, sector 8A will deflect the incident optical beam by 90 degrees. If the included angle<br>
for sector 8B is 44.5 degrees, then the incident optical beam will be deflected 89 degrees, and<br>
so on. In this example, different included angles are used for each of the sectors so that each<br>
sector will produce an output optical beam that is deflected by a different amount. However,<br>
the deflection angle will be substantially invariant within each sector due to the even number<br>
of reflective surfaces rotating together through the incident beam. For this example, the<br>
angular deflections have a nominal magnitude of 90 degrees and a variance of -15 to +15<br>
degrees from the nominal magnitude.<br>
[0042] In this example, the apex angle of each prism is 32.5862 degrees, calculated as<br>
follows. Each sector 8 subtends an equal angular amount. Since there are twenty nine sectors,<br>
each sector subtends 360/29 = 12.4138 degrees as shown in FIG. 1B. The two prisms 6 and 7<br>
have the same shape and, therefore, the same apex angle p. The component 9 is designed so<br>
that when the included angle is 45 degrees, the prisms 6 and 7 are positioned so that the line<br>
that bisects the apex angle also passes through the rotation axis 4. Therefore, the design must<br>
satisfy the equation ๏ข/2 + 12.4138 + ๏ข/2 = 45. Solving yields an apex angle of ๏ข = 32.5862<br>
degrees.<br>
[0043] The next prism 17 moving counterclockwise on the disk 9 from prism 6 is tilted<br>
slightly by an angle +๏ก so its bisecting line 17L does not pass through the center of rotation 4<br>
of the disk. As a result, the included angle for the sector formed by prisms 6 and 17 is (๏ข/2 +<br>
๏ก) + 12.4138 + ๏ข/2 = 45 + ๏ก. The next prism 16 is once again aligned with the rotation center<br>
4, so the included angle for the sector formed by prisms 16 and 17 is (๏ข/2 - ๏ก) + 12.4138 + ๏ข/2<br>
= 45 - ๏ก. The next prism is tilted by +2๏ก, followed by an aligned prism, and then a prism tilted<br>
by +3๏ก, followed by another aligned prism, etc. This geometry is maintained around the<br>
periphery of disk 4. This specific arrangement produces twenty nine deflection angles that<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
vary over the range of-l5 degrees to +15 degrees relative to the nominal 90 degree magnitude.<br>
Note that this approach uses an odd number of sectors where every other (approximately)<br>
prism is aligned and the alternate prisms are tilted by angles ๏ก, 2๏ก, 3๏ก, etc.<br>
[0044] Other numbers of sectors and different deflection angle patterns can be produced<br>
by variants of this specific geometry. In addition, other rotation schemes are possible that<br>
produce the same angular deflection but do not produce them in monotonically increasing<br>
order. As another example, the rotating component could have an even number of sectors and<br>
prisms, with every other prism aligned and the alternate prisms tilted by angles ๏ก/2, 3๏ก/2,<br>
5๏ก/2, etc. This would produce a set of angular deflections centered around a nominal<br>
magnitude, but without producing a deflection actually at the nominal magnitude.<br>
[0045]	In another approach, the rotation scheme causes the angular deflections to be<br>
arranged in a sequence such that the final delivered spots are not produced in sequential order.<br>
In other words, if the pattern is an array of spots 1, 2, 3,... 29, the sectors may be designed to<br>
generate the spots in an order other than sequentially from 1 to 29. For certain applications,<br>
producing adjacent spots within a short period of time can cause thermal coupling between the<br>
irradiated regions, and this can be deleterious to proper treatment. By arranging the prisms<br>
appropriately, the spots can be delivered such that temporally successive spots are spatially<br>
separated from each other while still delivering the full pattern of spots.<br>
[0046]	There is another geometric symmetry that is beneficial for some applications.<br>
Certain applications benefit by image patterns that are arranged to be in a zig-zag rather than a<br>
straight line geometry. For example, in some biologic applications, if the image spots are<br>
arranged along a straight line and high irradiance levels are present, the irradiation may<br>
accidentally cut tissue in the manner of a laser scalpel. Depositing the image spots in a zig-zag<br>
pattern substantially reduces the propensity for cutting or for undesirable thermal damage to<br>
biologic tissue while still permitting the thermal treatment level to be delivered. To achieve<br>
the zig-zag pattern, the prisms in the above-described geometry that have a rotation angle a<br>
applied to them can also have an orthogonal tilt angle applied to produce the lateral spot<br>
displacements used to produce a zig-zag geometry.<br>
[0047] In this example application, the family of output optical beams with different<br>
deflection angles subsequently enters an imaging lens group 19, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B,<br>
thus forming a pattern of spots displaced along a line focus. Many imaging optics groups are<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
possible using refractive, reflective, diffractive, or catadioptric forms. The preferred<br>
embodiment of FIGS. 2A-2B uses a solid catadioptric ("solid cat") form which is easily<br>
manufactured and maintains freedom from chromatic aberrations over a wide spectral range.<br>
FIG. 2A is a side view of the optical pattern generator system (i.e., same view as FIG. 1 A) and<br>
FIG. 2B is an end view of the system (i.e., viewer to the left in FIG. 1 A).<br>
[0048] FIG. 2A shows a solid catadioptric imaging lens group 19 combined with the<br>
rotating component 9 described above. In this view, only the reflective surfaces 21,22 of the<br>
rotating component 9 are shown and three different disk rotation positions are shown. The<br>
incident optical beam 20 is first reflected from surface 21 and then reflected from surface 22A.<br>
The optical beam enters the imaging lens group 19 and forms the spot 27A. Two other<br>
positions of the rotating disk 9 are also shown. When the input optical beam 20 reflects from<br>
surface 21 and then from surface 22B, the spot 27B is formed. When the input optical beam<br>
20 reflects from surface 21 and then from surface 22C, the spot 27C is formed. Note that FIG.<br>
2A shows an embodiment where the reflecting surface 21 is at the same angle for all of the<br>
optical paths. This is not a required condition and the geometry more frequently will use<br>
reflecting surfaces 21A, 21B and 21C with different angles and Cartesian coordinates to<br>
achieve specific image array patterns.<br>
[0049]	FIGS. 2A-2B,show the details of one embodiment of a solid cat imaging lens<br>
group. The optical beams exiting from the rotating component 19 first enter a planar surface<br>
28, are reflected from a planar mirror 23, are reflected from a spherical mirror 24, and exit<br>
from a planar surface which in this case is a continuation of surface 23. Element 25 is an<br>
optical window which seals the imaging lens group to maintain clean optical surfaces and item<br>
26 is an optical window that for some biologic applications is useful to maintain optical<br>
contact with the biologic tissue being treated.<br>
[0050] The geometry of this solid cat imaging lens group can be produced by classical<br>
optical fabrication methods in a highly precise and cost effective manner. In one approach, the<br>
spherical reflecting surface 24 is first produced in the material, and then the planar entry<br>
surface 28 is generated into the spherical surface. The planar reflecting surface 23 serves as<br>
the exit window. The geometry has an important advantage over other imaging lens groups in<br>
that the exit beams as shown in FIG. 2A are essentially telecentric. Telecentric exit beam<br>
geometries are advantageous for many biologic and industrial fabrication applications.<br>

WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
[0051] FIG.3 shows a detailed view of the ray fans 30 that produce three image spots 27<br>
at the focal plane of the system. In FIG. 3, each of the three image points have three sets of ray<br>
fans that are associated with a different rotation angle of the corresponding sector as it rotates<br>
through the incident optical beam. For example, ray fans 30A, 30B and 30C are shown for<br>
image spot 27A. Ray fan 30A might correspond to the sector just entering the incident optical<br>
beam, fan 30B to a rotation angle midway through the optical beam and ray fan 30B to the<br>
sector exiting the optical beam. Note that for the image spots 27, the optical beam moves<br>
slightly in the plane of the paper. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, ray fans 30A, 30B and<br>
30C are slightly offset in angle with respect to each other even though they converge at the<br>
same focus spot 27A. Although three sets of ray fans are shown for clarity, there is actually a<br>
continuum of ray sets produced by the continuous movement of the respective sector through<br>
the incident optical beam.<br>
[0052] For certain applications, the movement of the ray fans can have advantageous<br>
qualities. When the image spot is focused inside a tissue such as the human skin, the energy<br>
density is maximum for all rotation angles of the respective mirror pair at the internal focal<br>
point, while the energy density pattern moves on the outer skin surface thereby keeping the<br>
thermal effects at the skin surface much lower than at the internal treatment region. This<br>
condition can permit treatment of internal tissue features at high thermal levels while keeping<br>
the external tissue features at lower thermal levels and not producing unwanted damage to the<br>
tissue surface. The movement of the ray fans along a target plane is also useful in applications<br>
such as seam welding where long linear patterns can be used. It may be desired to operate the<br>
scanner with the target plane tilted and/or displaced relative to the image plane in order to<br>
achieve the desired movement of the ray fans for each of the beams.<br>
[0053]	FIG. 4 is a view of another optical pattern generator according to the invention,<br>
where the direction of propagation for the incident optical beam 42 has a substantial<br>
component in a direction normal to the plane of rotation. This pattern generator also uses a<br>
single rotating component 40 with rotation axis 41 to generate the pattern of interest. In this<br>
example, the disk 40 supports reflective segments 43, 44 that are rotated through the incident<br>
optical beam. The segments have parent optical surfaces that are rotationally symmetric, with<br>
their optical axes coincident with the rotation axis 41 of the rotating component. FIG. 4 shows<br>
the large, parent optical surfaces with their smaller reflective segments 43, 44 where the beam<br>
42 reflects twice and then exits the pattern generator. In FIG. 4, the rotating component<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
includes a disk 40 with pairs of opposing reflective surfaces 43, 44 for each sector, where<br>
different sectors may contain reflective surfaces with different radii of curvature such that the<br>
exiting beams will be displaced at different angles for each sector, but retain the PSD<br>
condition. Because surfaces 43,44 are rotationally symmetric and are rotated about their<br>
optical centerlines, both of the surfaces 43,44 that intersect with the optical beam are spatially<br>
invariant with respect to rotation. The radii of the two reflective segments 43,44 and their<br>
axial separation are chosen to keep the system approximately afocal for all segments while<br>
simultaneously varying the output beam angle.<br>
[0054] FIG. 5A shows a side view of the optical pattern generator described in FIG. 4<br>
combined with a reflective imaging lens group. Refractive and diffractive imaging lens groups<br>
could also be used. The input beam 42 is reflected from the first surface segment 43 and then<br>
reflects from the second surface segment 44A. In this specific embodiment, the surface<br>
segment 43 is the same surface for all sequential segments whereas the second surface segment<br>
radius is different for each sequential segment and is shown as 44A, 44B, and 44C. Variations<br>
of this embodiment are also possible using different first surface radii for sequential segments<br>
and these segments would then be represented by 43 A, 43B, and 43C respectively. The<br>
variation in angular deflection from, the rotating component would then be due to the different<br>
radii on the first surface segments 43.<br>
[0055]	For the specific embodiment where surface segment 43 remains the same for all<br>
sequential optical paths, the surface segment may be non-rotating. For example, it may be<br>
firmly fixed to the imaging lens group 45 rather than to the disk 40.<br>
[0056] In FIG. 5A, the imaging lens group 45 forms an image pattern comprised of the<br>
three spots produced by three sequential sectors on the image plane 53. For this optical pattern<br>
generator, the stigmatic (i.e., sharply focused) images lie on a surface that is tilted with respect<br>
to the optical axis of the imaging lens group 45. This image surface tilt is a consequence of the<br>
fact that only one of the surface segment pairs can have the two radii and separation distance<br>
that causes the exiting beam to be collinear with the input beam and also have no refractive<br>
power added to the beam. Other surface segment pairs require that their radii and separation<br>
distance be chosen to achieve the desired output beam angular deviation. To make the angular<br>
deviation less than the optical path that produces the collinear output beam, the first reflective<br>
surface 43C generally becomes flatter or has an increased radius of curvature while the second<br>
reflective surface 44C becomes steeper or has a decreased radius of curvature. This means that<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
the two surfaces no longer produce an atocal pair and positive power is added to the output<br>
beam causing it to focus closer to the imaging lens group. When the output beam angular<br>
deflection is greater than the collinear output beam, the reverse occurs and negative power is<br>
added to the output beam so that it focuses further from the imaging lens group.<br>
[0057] To achieve near diffraction-limited image spots, it is advantageous to use surface<br>
segments that are segments of aspheric surfaces of revolution with their optical axes coincident<br>
with the rotation axis 41 of the system. Some applications can have larger image spots and for<br>
these cases spherical surfaces of rotation can be acceptable.<br>
[0058] For some applications that do not require high optical throughput efficiency, the<br>
beam is on for only a short portion of the rotation range of each sector. The surface segments<br>
can be made toric aspheres so the refractive power can be cancelled for each of the surface<br>
segment pairs. This causes a small movement of the image spots as the surface segment pair<br>
rotates through the incident optical beam. The direction of movement is orthogonal to the<br>
direction that the spot is displaced from the system optical axis. The orthogonal image<br>
displacement is a function of the toric power of the surfaces, so each spot in the image moves<br>
orthogonal to its displacement distance by a different amount. This condition can be tolerated<br>
if the duty cycle (i.e. radiometric efficiency) of the system is low.<br>
[0059]	FIG. 5B shows a perspective view of FIG. 5A. The rotating disk 40 with its axis<br>
of rotation 41 is shown supporting two surface segments 43 and 44, which are segments of<br>
aspheric surfaces of rotation with their common optical axes coincident with the rotation axis<br>
41. As disk 40 rotates, a different pair of surface segments (not shown) would intercept the<br>
incident optical beam 42 and change the deflection angle of the exiting optical beam 46 just<br>
before the optical beam enters the imaging lens group 45. The imaging lens group 45<br>
comprises a first planar fold mirror 50, an image forming mirror 51 that is preferably an<br>
anamorphic aspheric surface to produce near diffraction-limited image spots, and a second<br>
planar fold mirror 52 that directs the image to the preferred location in space required for<br>
certain applications with long working distances.<br>
[0060] Applications that do not require near diffraction-limited image spots can use<br>
image forming mirrors 51 that are toric in form such that astigmatism is corrected or spherical<br>
in form if non-circular image spots are acceptable for an application.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
[0061] FIG.5C is a top view of this embodiment that shows the folded geometry used in<br>
one embodiment of the imaging lens group. This folded geometry avoids self-obscuration of<br>
the optical path by using an off-axis segment of an image forming mirror 51 or a tilted segment<br>
of an image forming mirror 51. This decentered geometry introduces astigmatism when the<br>
image forming mirror 51 is spherical in form. This astigmatism can be largely corrected by<br>
making the image forming mirror 51 toroidal or aspheric toroid in form. Further image<br>
correction is achieved by making the image forming mirror 51 an anamorphic asphere which<br>
consists of two aspheric shapes orthogonally oriented on the reflecting surface.<br>
[0062]	A variant of this embodiment is shown in FIG. 6 where the reflecting surface<br>
segments 43, 44 are from parent surfaces which are toric or anamorphic aspheric in form. This<br>
variant provides both beam angle variation for different optical paths and full correction of the<br>
refractive power so the rotating component is afocal and the image surface is normal to the<br>
system optical axis. Because the toric or anamorphic asphere segments 43, 44 change their<br>
profile as they are rotated, a small orthogonal displacement of the image spots which is<br>
dependent also upon spot linear displacement on the image surface will exist. For applications<br>
where the exposure period and therefore the rotation angle is small, this variant configuration<br>
may be acceptable.<br>
[0063] FIG. 7 is a view of another optical pattern generator using diffractive elements to<br>
deflect an incident optical beam into a series of output optical beams. In FIG. 7, an input<br>
optical beam 70 is incident upon a fold mirror 71 and then passes through a rotating disk 72<br>
which has a series of deflection sectors, each of which has diffractive optical element(s)<br>
located on the disk periphery. The disk 72 is rotated about its axis 73. Output optical beams<br>
74 produced by different sectors are shown entering an imaging lens group 75, which forms a<br>
pattern on the image surface 76. Each diffractive optical element has a different spatial period<br>
such that each succeeding sector causes a different angular deviation of the optical beam,<br>
which the imaging lens group 75 focuses to a different spot along the focal line.<br>
[0064] In a preferred embodiment, the diffractive elements uses diffractive structures<br>
that are arctuate in form rather than parallel lines and the arctuate grooves have an axis that is<br>
coincident with the rotation axis 73. This diffractive structure does not deflect the transmitted<br>
wavefront at a single angle but introduces a small angular variation of the wavefront which<br>
causes a small blurring of the image spots. This unwanted blurring can be partially corrected<br>
by the design of the imaging lens group so the image spots approach diffraction-limited<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
quality. The arctuate nature results in spatial invariance as each sector rotates through the<br>
incident optical beam 70. A variant of this embodiment uses reflective diffractive optical<br>
elements.<br>
[0065] FIG. 8 is a view of another optical pattern generator according to the invention.<br>
In this example, the rotating component has rotation axis 83. In FIG. 8, the input optical beam<br>
80 first passes through the internal cylindrical surface 81 and subsequently through the<br>
cylindrical surface 82. The cylindrical surfaces have a common rotation axis 83. Surface 82 is<br>
divided into sectors, each containing optical elements. In FIG. 8, these optical elements are<br>
linear diffraction gratings with different periodicity. With respect to FIG. 8, the rulings of the<br>
grating run in the direction perpendicular to the paper. Each diffractive grating surface<br>
deflects the output optical beam 84 by a different angle and the imaging lens group 85 forms a<br>
pattern of spots on the image surface 86. The use of linear gratings means that the sectors are<br>
spatially invariant as they rotate through the optical beam 80.<br>
[0066]	In alternate embodiments, refractive or reflective optical elements may also be<br>
used. For example, reflective facets may act on the input optical beam at cylindrical surface<br>
82, or refractive prisms may be used on cylindrical surface 82. In addition, elements may be<br>
placed on both surfaces 81 and 82, for example to form a Z-shaped folded optical path,<br>
analogous to FIG. 4.<br>
[0067]	The above examples are discussed in the context of one incident optical beam and<br>
one output optical beam. The invention is not limited to this case. For example, referring to<br>
FIG. 1 A, more than one optical beam may be simultaneously incident on the sector shown.<br>
The optical beams may or may not be overlapping. Overlapping beams may be combined<br>
upstream of the rotating component 9, for example by a wavelength-sensitive device, and then<br>
propagate together along the same optical path to the rotating component 9. Alternately, the<br>
optical beams may arrive at the same spot within a sector but from different angles. In FIG.<br>
1 A, a second source might be located slightly above the plane of the paper but travel at a slight<br>
downward angle so that it is incident on the sector at the same location as optical beam 1<br>
shown in FIG. 1 A.<br>
[0068]	Alternately, the optical beams may not overlap at all. In FIG. 1A, the prisms may<br>
extend in the direction perpendicular to the paper and the single optical beam 1 may be<br>
replaced by an array of optical beams also extending in the direction perpendicular to the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
paper. As a final example, more than one sector may be active at a time. In FIG. 1 A, the<br>
optical beam 1 originates from the left and is incident at approximately the 7:30 position of<br>
rotating component 9. A second optical beam may originate from the right and be incident at<br>
the symmetrical 4:30 position. Optical beams can be incident at other positions also, although<br>
the subsequent imaging may become more complex.<br>
[0069] The optical pattern generators described above can be used in many different<br>
applications. Some examples of biological applications are described in U.S. Patent Appl.<br>
Nos. 10/888,356 "Method and Apparatus for Fractional Photo Therapy of Skin," 10/751,041<br>
"Multi-Spot Laser Surgical Apparatus and Method" and 60/xxx (attorney case number 9454)<br>
"Optically-Induced Treatment of Internal Tissue," all of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0070]	Various industrial applications will also be apparent. One example is shown in<br>
FIGS. 9A-9B. In this example, the optical pattern generator shown in FIG. 1 is used to direct a<br>
laser beam 91 to various spots on a workpiece 95 to produce weld joints 97. FIG. 9A shows a<br>
single laser beam 91, deflected by one sector of the optical pattern generator 92 and focused by .<br>
lens 93 onto workpiece 95.<br>
[0071]	FIG. 9B shows a perspective view. In addition, two laser beams 91A-91B are<br>
used simultaneously to produce two parallel rows of welds 97A-97B. FIG. 9B also shows the<br>
entire pattern of welds produced by all sectors. For each laser beam, each focus spot shown in<br>
FIG. 9B is produced by a different sector of the optical pattern generator 92.<br>
[0072] FIG. 9C illustrates one row 97 of the welding pattern shown in FIG. 9B. There is<br>
a total of fifteen tack welds. The numbers show the order in which the welds are generated.<br>
Notice that the welds are not generated in order from left to right. Instead, a far left weld 1 is<br>
generated and then a far right weld 2 is generated. The remaining welds are selected to tack<br>
long spans at their midpoints. For example, weld 3 tacks approximately the middle of the span<br>
between welds 1 and 2; weld 4 tacks the midpoint between 2 and 3 (which is the then-longest<br>
span); weld 5 tacks approximately the middle between welds 1 and 3, etc.<br>
[0073] This approach is advantageous because the initial two welds constrain the part at<br>
both ends, thus reducing the need for clamping. In addition, the laser energy is distributed<br>
across the workpiece, thus avoiding excess heat buildup as might be the case if the welds were<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/088744	PCT/US2006/004821<br>
made sequentially from left to right. Tacking the midpoints of long spans also controls the<br>
effect of differential thermal expansion due to local heat buildup.<br>
[0074] Due to symmetry in the welding pattern, the same effects may be realized by<br>
starting with weld 9 rather than weld 1. This reduces the wait time before start of the welding<br>
pattern. If the workpiece is ready for welding but the active sector is the one for weld 2, the<br>
device need only wait until the sector for weld 9 rather than waiting for the entire pattern to<br>
cycle back to weld 1. Weld speeds of 1-10,000 welds per second could be produced with the<br>
invention, preferably with weld speeds of hundreds or thousands of welds per second. As<br>
shown in FIG. 9D, the control of thermal expansion can be optimized further if symmetry is<br>
not required for the scanner wheel. Other arrangements will be obvious to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
[0075] FIG. 10 illustrates another optical pattern generator according to the invention.<br>
This optical pattern generator uses a single rotating component 1000 with rotation axis 1001 to<br>
generate the pattern of interest. In this example, each segment is comprised of a pair of<br>
reflective surfaces 1003 and 1004, which are supported by the single rotating component 1000.<br>
Three different rotational angles of the single rotating component 1000 are superimposed in<br>
FIG. 1 to illustrate the deflection of the incident optical beam 1002 from the pair of reflective<br>
surfaces 1003 and 1004 as the single rotating component is rotated. This rotation produces<br>
three separate positions for 1003 and 1004, which are illustrated as 1003A, 1003B, and 1003C;<br>
and 1004 A, 1004B, and 1004C respectively. The deflection angle of the incident optical beam<br>
is preserved (because of the reflection off an even number of surfaces) as the component 1000<br>
is rotated.<br>
[0076] Although the detailed description contains many specifics, these should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the invention but merely as illustrating different examples<br>
and aspects of the invention. It should be appreciated that the scope of the invention includes<br>
other embodiments not discussed in detail above. For example, the optical beam can be<br>
incident at angles other than parallel to or normal to the plane of rotation of the rotating<br>
component. In addition, different wavelengths can be used depending on the specific<br>
application. Generally, the term optical beam is used to refer to electromagnetic radiation<br>
having at least half of its power in the wavelength range of 200 to 12000 nm. Various other<br>
modifications, changes and variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art may be<br>
made in the arrangement, operation and details of the method and apparatus of the present<br>

An optical<br>
pattern generator uses a single<br>
rotating component (Fig. 1A,<br>

includes a number of deflection<br>
sectors (8A, 8B, 8C, etc.). Each<br>
sector deflects an incident optical<br>
beam by a substantially constant<br>
angular amount although this<br>
amount may vary from one<br>
sector to the next. The rotating<br>
component may be combined<br>
with an imaging lens group<br>
(Fig. 2A, 19) that produces, for<br>
example, image points, spots,<br>
lines displaced along a line locus.</td>
