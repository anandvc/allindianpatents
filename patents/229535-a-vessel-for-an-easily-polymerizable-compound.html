DESCRIPTION<br>
VESSEL FOR EASILY POLYMERIZABLE COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to column equipment such as a distillation column and an evaporation column for an easily polymerizable compound or a decomposition reaction column for a high boiling point substance, and peripheral equipment of the same. The present invention more specifically relates to column equipment having a reboiler and peripheral equipment of the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Production equipment of an easily polymerizable compound such as (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrylate employs column equipment such as a distillation column for crude (meth)acrylic acid or crude (meth)acrylate or a decomposition reaction column for recovering (meth)acrylic acid or the like by decomposing a high boiling point substance. In such column equipment, part of a column bottom liquid introduced into a reboiler and heated therein may be returned to the column. In order to return a liquid containing an easily polymerizable compound to the column from the reboiler, the column may be provided with: a nozzle for supplying the heated liquid to the column from an opening part on a side wall of the column; an impingement<br><br>
plate for preventing scattering of the liquid to a supply direction; and a top plate for preventing upward scattering of the liquid.<br>
In column equipment having such a structure, a liquid containing an easily polymerizable compound accumulates on a top face of the top plate owing to: supply from the side wall of the column; adhesion or dropping of droplets from above the top plate; and the like. The accumulated liquid is heated by a liquid or gas heated in a reboiler and may form a polymerized product.<br>
As a countermeasure to formation of the polymerized product, a method involving providing at least one hole on a top plate for preventing accumulation of the liquid and allowing the liquid on the top plate to fall may be employed. However, a liquid or gas heated in a reboiler passes through this hole, and thus-caused resistance prevents sufficient falling of the liquid on the top plate. Provision of many holes for the purpose of sufficient falling of the liquid allows the liquid or gas heated in a reboiler to pass through the holes. Thus, the purpose for providing the top plate (to suppress upward flow of the liquid or gas heated in a reboiler with the top plate) cannot be sufficiently attained.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to allow: suppression of formation of a polymerized product due to<br><br>
flowing of a liquid or gas heated in a reboiler into a column with a simple structure; and a stable continuous operation of column equipment over a long period of time by solving the above problems.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have studied intensively and have found out that the above object can be attained by providing a top plate for preventing upward scattering of a liquid containing an easily polymerizable compound supplied from a reboiler such that a tip end of the top plate is inclined downward, in column equipment for treating the easily polymerizable compound.<br>
That is, the present invention is a vessel for an easily polymerizable compound, comprising: a receiving part, which has a side wall and a supply port opened to the side wall for supplying the liquid, for receiving the liquid supplied from the supply port; a top plate, which is provided so as to extend from the side wall above the supply port, for preventing upward scattering of the liquid from the supply port; and an impingement plate, which is provided away from the supply port, for preventing scattering of the liquid from the supply port to a supply direction, wherein a top face of the top plate is inclined downward from a base end to a tip end of the top plate, when a side wall end of the top plate is defined as the base end and an extended end of the top plate is defined as the tip end.<br>
According to the present invention described above, inclination of the top plate prevents formation of a<br><br>
polymerized product because a liquid accumulated on the top plate is eliminated.<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
A vessel for an easily polymerizable compound of the present invention comprises: a receiving part, which has a side wall and a supply port opened to the side wall for<br><br>
supplying the liquid, for receiving the liquid supplied from the supply port; a top plate, which is provided so as to extend from the side wall above the supply port, for preventing upward scattering of the liquid from the supply port; and an impingement plate, which is provided away from the supply port, for preventing scattering of the liquid from the supply port to a supply direction. The vessel for an easily polymerizable compound of the present invention can be applied to a vessel receiving at least the liquid.<br>
The easily polymerizable compound which is a subject of the present invention is not particularly limited so long as the compound easily polymerizes by virtue of heat or the like. Of the easily polymerizable compounds, at least one selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and esters thereof is preferred. Examples of acrylates include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, t-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, and methoxyethyl acrylate. Examples of methacrylates include similar compounds to the above acrylates.<br>
The receiving part is not particularly limited so long as the receiving part includes a side wall and a supply port for supplying the liquid and receives the liquid supplied from the supply port. Examples of the receiving part include a distillation column, an evaporation column, a decomposition reaction column for a high boiling point<br><br>
substance or the like, and a tank for receiving a liquid easily polymerizable compound. In the present invention, the receiving part is preferably one selected from the group consisting of a distillation column, an evaporation column, and a decomposition reaction column for a high boiling point substance or the like.<br>
The liquid containing an easily polymerizable compound is not particularly limited so long as the liquid contains an easily polymerizable compound. Examples of the liquid include: a liquid containing a liquid easily polymerizable compound; and a solution of the easily polymerizable compound containing an appropriate solvent and an easily polymerizable compound. The liquid may contain an additive such as a polymerization inhibitor added as required.<br>
The top plate is provided so as to extend from the side wall above the supply port in the receiving part. As the top plate, a top plate; which prevents upward scattering of the liquid from the supply port and has a top face inclined downward from a base end to a tip end of the top plate, when a side wall end of the top plate is defined as the base end and an extended end of the top plate is defined as the tip end; is used. Such a top plate may employ: a plate having a shape with parallel top and bottom faces; or a member shaped into a wedge-like shape with the top face or the top face and the bottom face in which a distance between the top face and a bottom face of a section gradually decreases<br><br>
from one end to the other.<br>
Further, the top plate may have a top face inclined downward from a central part to at least one side end of the top plate. Examples of such a top plate include: a semi-cylindrical top plate provided such that a cross sectional shape of the top plate across an extension direction is an arc which is convex upward; and a flat plate provided to be inclined downward from one side end to the other side end of the top plate. Such a top plate may be inclined downward from a base end to a tip end, or need not be inclined downward from a base end to a tip end.<br>
The shape and number of the top plate used in the present invention are not particularly limited so long as the above-mentioned conditions are satisfied. Further, the top plate can be provided with holes, grooves, or the like for immediately eliminating the easily polymerizable compound on the top face of the top plate without limitation to the number or shape.<br>
An angle of 91 to 135Â° between a top face of the top plate and the side wall is preferably in terms of preventing upward scattering of the liquid from the supply port and preventing accumulation of the liquid on the top face of the top plate and so on. An angle of inclination of the top plate of less than 91Â° may not sufficiently prevent the accumulation of the liquid on the top face of the top plate, possibly resulting in formation of a polymerized product of the easily polymerizable compound. An angle of<br><br>
inclination of the top plate exceeding 135Â° may not sufficiently prevent upward scattering of the liquid or may adversely affect a supply of the liquid to the receiving part.<br>
The shape and number of the impingement plate are not particularly limited so long as the impingement plate is provided away from the supply port in the receiving part, and prevents scattering of the liquid from the supply port in a supply direction. The impingement plate may be provided vertically from the top plate or may be supported by a supporting member extending from the side wall.<br>
The vessel for an easily polymerizable compound of the present invention preferably comprises: a liquid circulation passage for drawing the liquid received in the receiving part and returning the liquid to the receiving part from the supply port; and a reboiler for heating the liquid in the liquid circulation passage, for applying the present invention to the above-mentioned distillation column, evaporation column, and decomposition reaction column for a high boiling point substance.<br>

The reboiler is not particularly limited so long as the reboiler is a device for heating the liquid introduced into the liquid circulation passage to a desired temperature. The reboiler may employ a known device such as: a heat exchanger such as a vertical fixed tube plate type heat exchanger in which the liquid flows through tubes and a heating medium flows through a shell; and a heater for heating the liquid in the liquid circulation passage. Specific examples of the heat exchanger include a vertical fixed tube plate type, a horizontal fixed tube plate type, a U-tube type, a double-pipe type, a spiral type, a square block type, a plate type, and a film evaporator type. The reboiler is usually attached to each column. The reboiler is generally classified into a reboiler provided inside a column (receiving part) and a reboiler provided outside the column, but is usually provided outside the column in the present invention.<br>

In the decomposition reaction apparatus for acrylic acid or acrylate shown in Fig. 6, a decomposition reaction temperature is preferably 110 to 250Â°C, particularly preferably 120 to 230Â° C. A decomposition reaction time is preferably 0.5 to 50 hours (10 to 50 hours for a low decomposition temperature, and 0.5 to 10 hours for a high decomposition temperature). A pressure may be reduced pressure or normal pressure.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, a pump may be provided upstream of the reboiler 5 in the circulation passage. Vacuum equipment is generally not provided in the decomposition reaction apparatus, but may be provided downstream of the vent gas cooling heat exchanger 35<br><br>
depending on the conditions such as the type or composition of the high boiling point substance, similar to the distillation apparatus.<br>
The tubes 2 and 11 constituting the draw line in Figs, 5 and 6 are connected by connecting flanges 2a and lla as shown in Fig. 1. The tubes 3, 4, and 6 and the nozzle 7 constituting the circulation passage in Figs. 5 and 6 are connected by connecting flanges 3a and 4a and connecting flanges 6a and 7a as shown in Fig. 1,<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the column body 1 is provided with: a side wall; a supply port la opened to the side wall, for supplying the column bottom liquid to the column body 1 from the nozzle 7; a top plate 12a, which is provided so as to extend from the side wall above the supply port la, for preventing upward scattering of the column bottom liquid from the supply port la; and an impingement plate 12b, which is provided away from the supply port 12a, for preventing scattering of the column bottom liquid from the supply port la to a supply direction (direction from the side wall to the center of the column body 1).<br>
The top plate 12a is composed of a plate member having a uniform thickness. As shown in Fig. 1, the top plate 12a is provided to be inclined downward from a base end to a tip end thereof such that an angle (inclination) between an extension direction of the top plate 12a and the side wall is 91* or more. The inclination is preferably 91 to 135Â° , more preferably 95 to 135Â° . The top plate 12a is a<br><br>
plate member having a uniform thickness, and thus an angle between a top face of the top plate 12a and the side wall is equal to the inclination. A hole may be provided on the top plate 12a for accelerating falling of a liquid accumulated on the top face of the top plate 12a, However, the hole need not be provided.<br>
The impingement plate 12b is also composed of a plate member having a uniform thickness. As shown in Fig. 1, the impingement plate 12b is provided vertically to the top plate 12a downward from a tip end edge of the top plate 12a. A length of downward extension of the impingement plate 12b is not particularly limited. However, the impingement plate 12b is preferably extended downward to a lower end edge of the supply port la or more, and the length of the impingement plate is more preferably equal to or more than a diameter of the supply port la. The impingement plate 12b may be provided parallel to the side wall, or provided with an appropriate angle to the side wall such that a distance between the side wall and the impingement plate 12b gradually increases downward, for example.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a width A of the top plate 12a or the impingement plate 12b is preferably equal to or more than the diameter of the supply port la. An extension length B of the top plate 12a is not particularly limited, but is preferably set accordingly such that an opening area of the impingement plate 12b is equal to or more than a sectional area of the supply port la.<br><br>
The opening area used herein is represented by the product of the width (A in Fig. 2) of the impingement plate 12b and the distance between the side wall and the impingement plate 12b. When a thickness of the impingement plate 12b is substantially small compared to the opening area, the opening area may be represented by the product of A and B in Fig. 2.<br>
The column bottom liquid heated in the reboiler 5 is supplied to the column body 1 from the nozzle 7 through the supply port la. Upward flow or scattering of the column bottom liquid supplied from the supply port la is restricted by the top plate 12a, and flow or scattering in a central direction in the column body 1 of the column bottom liquid is restricted by the impingement plate 12b. The column bottom liquid supplied from the supply port la flows downward regardless of the flow rate. Thus, scattering of the column bottom liquid to the side wall of the column body 1 or the inside of the column body 1 containing trays, packing, and the like provided as required can be prevented.<br>
The top plate 12a is provided to be inclined downward from a base end to a tip end of the top plate 12a, and thus the column bottom liquid or a condensate of an easily polymerizable compound such as acrylic acid, acrylate, raw materials of the acrylic acid and acrylate, and by-products in the column body 1 flows down from the top plate 12a even if attached to the top face of the top plate 12a. Thus, accumulation of the condensate on the top face of the top<br><br>
plate 12a is prevented, thereby formation of a polymerized product from the condensate can be prevented.<br>
The column body 1 may comprise: a vertical plate, which is provided vertically and downward on each side of the top plate 12a from a side end edge of the top plate 12a, for preventing scattering of the column bottom liquid in a horizontal direction from the supply port la; and a bottom plate below the supply port la, for example, in addition to the impingement plate 12b as the case may be. The bottom plate may be provided with inclination or with holes as in the top plate 12a. When a large volume of the column bottom liquid is circulated from the reboiler, the volume of the column bottom liquid supplied is large and accumulation of the column bottom liquid does not occur on the top face of the bottom plate. In such a case, the bottom plate may be horizontal or need not be provided with holes. The top plate 12a may be provided along the side wall of the column body 1, and a provided length of the top plate 12a is not particularly limited.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 each employ the column body 1, the draw line, and the circulation passage shown in Fig. 1, but may employ the column body 1, the draw line, and the circulation passage shown in each of Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
The structure of the column body 1 and peripheral parts shown in Fig. 3 is the same as the structure of the column body 1 and peripheral parts shown in Fig. 1 except that: the introduction nozzle 3 is connected near a bottom<br><br>
part of the column body 1 to directly introduce the column bottom liquid to be circulated from the column body 1; and the draw nozzle 2 does not branch and is connected to the tube 11 alone.<br>
The structure of the column body 1 and peripheral parts shown in Fig. 4 is the same as the structure of the column body 1 and peripheral parts shown in Fig. 1 except that: a pot part 10 swelling downward is provided in a lower end part of the column body 1; the introduction nozzle 3 is connected to the pot part 10 on a side wall of the pot part 10; the column bottom liquid to be circulated is introduced from the pot part 10; and the draw nozzle 2 is connected to a bottom part of the pot part 10, does not branch, and is connected to the tube 11.<br>
In the structures shown in Figs. 3 and 4, scattering of the column bottom liquid to the inside of the column body 1 and formation of a polymerized product on the top face of the top plate 12a are also prevented as in the structure shown in Fig. 1.<br>

A decomposition reaction was carried out at a pressure of 100 kPa, a decomposition temperature of 197Â° C, and a residence time of 50 minutes. As a result, a reaction residue was obtained at 200.1 kg/h and drawn from a column bottom. The reaction residue had a composition consisting of: 8.7 wt% butyl acrylate; 62.5 wt% B-butyl butoxypropionate; 2.0 wt% butyl acryloxypropionate; 0.3 wt% butyl B-hydroxypropionate; 8.7 wt% hydroquinone; 5.8 wt% methoxyquinone; 0 .8 wt% butanol; 2 .9 wt% sulfuric acid; and 8.3 wt% other compounds.<br>

the reboiler 5 was measured with a flowmeter provided at an outlet of the pump 40 , and an initial flow rate was 32,000 kg/h. The column bottom liquid flowed through tubes of the reboiler 5.<br>
After a continuous operation for 3 months, the operation was stopped, and the reboiler 5, the inside of the column body 1, the top plate 12a, and the impingement plate 12b were inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: no accumulated substances; a stable supply of the liquid to the reboiler 5 during the operation; and no clogging during the operation.<br><example><br>
The same operation was repeated as that in Example<br>
1 except that the installation angle 0 (inclination) of the top plate 12a was changed to 100Â° . After a continuous operation for 3 months, the operation was stopped, and the reboiler 5 and the like were inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: no accumulated substances; and no clogging during the operation.<br><comparative example><br>
The same operation was repeated as that in Example<br>
2 except that the installation angle 0 (inclination) of the top plate 12a was changed to 90Â° . After a continuous operation for 3 months, a reaction temperature could not be maintained gradually. The operation of the<br><br>
decomposition reaction apparatus was stopped, and the inside of the apparatus was inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: a viscous polymerized product on the top face of the top plate 12a; and a polymerized product inside the tubes of the reboiler 5.<br><example><br>
A decomposition reaction of a high boiling point liquid was carried out using the same apparatus as that in Example 1. The high boiling point liquid has a composition consisting of: 45.3 wt% acrylic acid; 10.0 wt% maleic acid; 42.4 wt% acrylic acid dimer (acryloxypropionic acid); 1.3 wt% hydroquinone; and 1.0 wt% phenothiazine. The high boiling point liquid was supplied to the column body 1 at 580 kg/h.<br>
A decomposition reaction was carried out at a pressure of 72 kPa, a decomposition temperature of 188Â°C, and a residence time of 70 minutes. As a result, a reaction residue was obtained at 130. 5 kg/h from the column bottom. The reaction residue had a composition consisting of: 8.0 wt% acrylic acid; 14.0 wt% maleic acid; 67.2 wt% acrylic acid dimer (acryloxypropionic acid); 5 .8 wt% hydroquinone; 4.4 wt% phenothiazine; and 0.6 wt% oligomer and polymer.<br>
After a continuous operation for 3 months, the operation was stopped, and the reboiler 5 and the like were inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: no accumulated substances; stable a supply of the column<br><br>
bottom liquid to the reboiler 5 during the operation; and no clogging during the operation.<br><comparative example><br>
The same operation was repeated as that in Example<br>
2 except that the installation angle 9 (inclination) of the top plate 12a was changed to 90Â° . After a continuous operation for 1 month, a temperature of the column bottom liquid could not be maintained. The operation of the decomposition reaction apparatus was stopped immediately, and the inside of the apparatus was inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: a popcorn-like polymerized product on the top face of the top plate 12a; and partial clogging in the tubes of the reboiler 5.<br><example><br>
Distillation of crude acrylic acid was carried out in the distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 5 using the distillation column of stainless steel SUS 316 having an inner diameter of 1,100 mm, a length of 20,000 mm, and 21 perforated plates (dual flow trays) provided thereinside as the column body 1. The installation angle<br>
0(inclination) of the top plate 12a is 100Â° . A pump was provided in the middle of the tube 4. The tube 4 has the same diameter as that of the introduction nozzle 3. A crude acrylic monomer was a mixture consisting of 99.2 wt% acrylic acid, 0.3 wt% maleic acid, 0.3 wt% acrylic acid dimer, 0.1<br><br>
wt% hydroquinone, and 0.1 wt% phenothiazine, and the mixture was supplied to the column body 1 at 90Â° C and 1,300 kg/h.<br>

A liquid prepared by dissolving 1 wt% phenothiazine in acrylic acid was supplied to the column body 1 at 31 kg/h. An operation was carried out at a column top pressure of 2.8 kPa, a column bottom pressure of 7.9 kPa, a column top temperature of 53Â° C, and a column bottom temperature of 75Â° C, to thereby obtain high purity acrylic acid having a purity of 99.8 wt% or more from the column top.<br>
The reboiler 5 was a vertical fixed tube plate type heat exchanger. A supply of the column bottom liquid to the reboiler 5 was measured with a flowmeter provided by at an outlet of the tube 4, and an initial flow rate was 68,000 kg/h. The column bottom liquid flowed through tubes of the reboiler 5.<br>
After a continuous operation for 6 months, the operation was stopped, and the reboiler 5 was inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: no accumulated substances; a stable supply of the column bottom liquid to the reboiler 5 during the operation; and no clogging during the operation.<br><br><comparative example><br>
The same operation was repeated as that in Example<br>
4 except that the installation angle Î¸ (inclination) of the top plate 12a was changed to 90Â°. After a continuous operation for 4 months, a temperature of the column bottom liquid could not be maintained and a steam could not be supplied to the reboiler 5- The operation of the decomposition reaction apparatus was stopped, and the inside of the apparatus was inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed: a popcorn-like polymerized product on the top face of the top plate 12a; and partial clogging in the tubes of the reboiler 5.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, a simple structure including a top plate having an inclined top face suppresses formation of a polymerized product on the top face of the top plate caused by a liquid containing an easily polymerizable compound. Thus, problems such as clogging by the polymerized product do not occur, and the present invention can provide a vessel for an easily polymerizable compound capable of a stable continuous operation over a long period of time in handling of the easily polymerizable compound such as production and purification of the easily polymerizable compound.<br>
When the present invention is applied to column equipment involving heating a column bottom liquid which<br><br>
is a liquid containing an easily polymerizable compound in a reboiler and circulating the column bottom liquid such as a distillation column, an evaporation column, or a decomposition reaction column, clogging of the reboiler by the polymerized product is prevented. Thus, the column equipment can be stably and continuously operated over a long period of time.<br>
In particular, the present invention is more effective when applied to production or purification of (meth)acrylic acid (acrylic acid or methacrylic acid) and esters thereof.<br><br>
