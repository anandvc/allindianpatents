				<td>BROADSPECTRUM SUBSTITUTED BENZIMIDAZOLE SULFONAMIDE HIV<br>
PROTEASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to substituted-benzimidazole sulfonamides, their use as aspartic protease inhibitors, in particular as broadspectrum HIV protease inhibitors, processes for their preparation as well as pharmaceutical compositions and diagnostic kits comprising them. The present invention also concerns combinations of the present substituted benzimidazole sulfonamides with another anti-retroviral agent. It further relates to their use in assays as reference compounds or as reagents.<br>
The virus causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is known by different names, including T-lymphocyte virus III (HTLV-III) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) or AIDS-related virus (ARV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Up until now, two distinct families have been identified, i.e. HIV-1 and HIV-2. Hereinafter, HIV will be used to generically denote these viruses.<br>
One of the critical pathways in a retroviral life cycle is the processing of polyprotein precursors by aspartic protease. For instance the HIV viral gag-pol protein is processed by HIV protease. The correct processing of the precursor polyproteins by the aspartic protease is required for the assembly of infectious virions, thus making the aspartic protease an attractive target for antiviral therapy. In particular for HIV treatment, the HIV protease is an attractive target.<br>
HIV protease inhibitors (Pis) are commonly administered to AIDS patients in combination with other anti-HIV compounds such as, for instance nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), fusion inhibitors such as T-20 or other protease inhibitors. Despite the fact that these antiretrovirals are very useful, they have a common limitation, namely, the targeted enzymes in the HIV virus are able to mutate in such a way that the known drugs become less effective, or even ineffective against these mutant HIV viruses. Or, in other words, the HIV virus creates an ever increasing resistance against the available drugs.<br>
Resistance of retroviruses, and in particular the HIV virus, against inhibitors is a major cause of therapy failure. For instance, half of the patients receiving anti-HIV combination therapy do not respond fully to the treatment, mainly because of resistance of the virus to one or more drugs used. Moreover, it has been shown that resistant virus is carried over to newly infected individuals, resulting in severely limited therapy options for these drug-naive patients. Therefore, there is a need in the art for new<br>
compounds for retrovirus therapy, more particularly for AIDS therapy. The need in the art is particularly acute for compounds that are active not only on wild type HIV virus, but also on the increasingly more common resistant HIV viruses.<br>
Known antiretrovirals, often administered in a combination therapy regimen, will eventually cause resistance as stated above. This often may force the physician to boost the plasma levels of the active drugs in order for said antiretrovirals to regain effectivity against the mutated HIV viruses. The consequence of which is a highly undesirable increase in pill burden. Boosting plasma levels may also lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with the prescribed therapy. Thus, it is not only important to have compounds showing activity for a wide range of HIV mutants, it is also important that there is little or no variance in the ratio between activity against mutant HIV virus and activity against wild type HIV virus (also defined as fold resistance or FR) over a broad range of mutant HIV strains. As such, a patient may remain on the same combination therapy regimen for a longer period of time since the C1-6ance that a mutant HIV virus will be sensitive to the active ingredients will be increased.<br>
Finding compounds with a high potency on the wild type and on a wide variety of mutants is also of importance since the pill burden can be reduced if therapeutic levels are kept to a minimum. One way of reducing this pill burden is finding anti-HIV compounds with good bioavailability, i.e. a favourable pharmacokinetic and metabolic profile, such that the daily dose can be minimized and consequently also the number of pills to be taken.<br>
Another important C1-6aracteristic of a good anti-HIV compound is that plasma protein binding of the inhibitor has minimal or even no effect on its potency.<br>
Thus, there is a high medical need for protease inhibitors that are able to combat a broad spectrum of mutants of the HIV virus with little variance in fold resistance, have a good bioavailability and experience little or no effect on their potency due to plasma protein binding.<br>
Up until now, several protease inhibitors are on the market or are being developed. One particular core structure (depicted below) has been disclosed in a number of references, such as, WO 95/06030, WO 96/22287, WO 96/28418, WO 96/28463, WO 96/28464, WO 96/28465, WO 99/65870, WO 99/67254, WO 00/76961 and WO 97/18205. The compounds disclosed therein are described as retroviral protease inhibitors.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
WO 99/67254 discloses 4-substituted-phenyl sulfonamides capable of inhibiting multidrug resistant retroviral proteases.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Surprisingly, the substituted-benzimidazole sulfonamides of the present invention are found to have a favourable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile. Not only are they active against wild-type HIV virus, but they also show a broad spectrum activity against various mutant HIV viruses exhibiting resistance against known protease inhibitors.<br>

Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention include those compounds wherein for instance a hydroxy group, such as the hydroxy group on the asymmetric carbon atom, or an amino group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a patient, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl or free amino, respectively.<br>
Typical examples of prodrugs are described for instance in WO 99/33795,<br>
WO 99/33815, WO 99/33793 and WO 99/33792 all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are C1-6aracterized by excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors in vivo.<br>
For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a pharmaceutically unacceptable counterion may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I). All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using the appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; nitric; phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methane-<br>
sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt form by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl, -D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
Conversely said base addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like. Generically they also are called solvates.<br>
The N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.<br>
The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interC1-6angeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible srereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term 'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The diastereomeric racemates of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods which may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.<br>
It is clear to a person skilled in the art that the compounds of formula (I) contain at least one asymmetric center and thus may exist as different stereoisomeric forms. This asymmetric center is indicated with a asterisk (*) in the figure below.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The absolute configuration of each asymmetric center that may be present in the compounds of formula (I) may be indicated by the stereochemical descriptors R and S, this R and S notation corresponding to the rules described in Pure Appl. Chem. 1976, 45, 11 -30. The carbon atom marked with the asterisk (*) preferably has the R configuration.<br>

Due to their favorable pharmacological properties, particularly their activity against<br>
multi-drug resistant HIV protease enzymes, the compounds of the present invention are<br>
useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HIV and for the prophylaxis of these<br>
individuals.<br>
The prophylaxis treatment can be advantageous in cases where an individual has been<br>
subjected to a high risk of exposure to a virus, as can occur when individual has been in<br>
contact with an infected individual where there is a high risk of viral transmission. As an example, prophylactic administration of said compounds would be advantageous in a situation where a health care worker has been exposed to blood from an HIV-infected individual, or in other situations where an individual engaged in high-risk activities that potentially expose that individual to the HIV virus.<br>
In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the protease enzyme. Conditions which may be prevented or treated with the compounds of the present invention include, but is not limited to, treating a wide range of states of HIV infection: AIDS, ARC (Aids related complex), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and actual or potential exposure to HIV. The compounds of the present are also useful for treating progressive generalized lymphadenophaty, Kaposi's syndrome, thrombocytopenia purpurea, AIDS-related neurological conditions such as AIDS dementia complex, multiple sclerosis, tropical parapesis, and also anti-HIV antibody positive and HIV-positive conditions, including such conditions in asymptomatic patients. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating infection by HIV after suspected past exposure to HIV by e.g., blood transfusion, exC1-6ange of body fluids, bites, accidental needle stick, or exposure to patient blood during surgery. The term prevention includes prophylaxis of HIV infection and prophylaxis of the evolution of HIV infection to AIDS.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines against above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HIV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HIV-1.

The compounds of the present invention may be useful to prevent or delay the onset of mutations in HIV protease, or if the HIV protease contains mutations at the initiation of therapy may prevent or delay the occurrence of additional mutations in the HIV protease.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also find use in inhibiting ex vivo samples containing HIV or expected to be exposed to HIV. Hence, the present compounds may be used to inhibit HIV present in a body fluid sample which contains or is suspected to contain or be exposed to HIV.<br>
Also, the combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of the present invention can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of the present invention, and (b) another antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treatment of retroviral infections, in particular, in the treatment of infections with multi-drug resistant retroviruses. Thus, to combat or treat HIV infections, or the infection and disease associated with HIV infections, such as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS Related Complex (ARC), the compounds of this invention may be co-administered in combination with for instance, binding inhibitors, such as, for example, dextran sulfate, suramine, polyanions, soluble CD4, PRO-542, BMS-806; fusion inhibitors, such as, for example, T20, T1249, RPR 103611, YK-FH312, IC 9564, 5-helix, D-peptide ADS-J1; co-receptor binding inhibitors, such as, for example, AMD 3100, AMD-3465, AMD7049, AMD3451 (Bicyclams), TAK220, TAK 779, T-22, ALX40-4C; SHC-C (SCH351125), SHC-D,<br>

Such combination therapy in different formulations, may be administered simultaneously, sequentially or independently of each other. Alternatively, such combination may be administered as a single formulation, whereby the active ingredients are released from the formulation simultaneously or separately.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with modulators of the metabolization following application of the drug to an individual. These modulators include compounds that interfere with the metabolization at cytochromes, such as cytochrome P450. Some modulators inhibit cytochrome P450. It is known that several isoenzymes exist of cytochrome P450, one of which is cytochrome P450 3A4. Ritonavir is an example of a modulator of metabolization via cytochrome P450. Interesting compounds having an effect at cytochrome P450 include those compounds containing a thiazolyl, imidazolyl or pyridinyl moiety. Such combination therapy in different formulations, may be administered simultaneously, separately or<br>
sequentially. Alternatively, such combination may be administered as a single formulation, whereby the active ingredients are released from the formulation simultaneously or separately.<br>
Such modulator may be administered at the same or different ratio as the compound of the present invention. Preferably, the weight ratio of such modulator vis-a-vis the compound of the present invention (modulator:ompound of the present invention) is 1:1 or lower, more preferable the ratio is 1:3 or lower, suitably the ratio is 1:10 or lower, more suitably the ratio is 1:30 or lower.<br>
The combination may provide a synergistic effect, whereby viral infectivity and its associated symptoms may be prevented, substantially reduced, or eliminated completely. Combinations of the compounds of formula (I) with another HIV protease inhibitor as cytochrome P450 inhibitor can act synergistically, in an additive way or antagonistically. This can be assessed in an experimental setting where the potency of different ratios of the two HIV-protease inhibitors is measured. Results can be plotted in an isobologram graph according to the method described by Chou and Talalay (Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22: 27-55, 1984) Synergism between two inhibitors would mean a more potent combination therapy, but with no increase in undesired side effects.<br>
For an oral administration form, compounds of the present invention are mixed with suitable additives, such as excipients, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by means of the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic, or oily solutions. Examples of suitable inert carriers are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose, or starch, in particular, corn starch. In this case the preparation can be carried out both as dry and as moist granules. Suitable oily excipients or solvents are vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil. Suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are water, ethanol, sugar solutions, or mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols are also useful as further auxiliaries for other administration forms.<br>
For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with the substances customary therefor such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further auxiliaries, are brought into solution, suspension, or emulsion. The compounds of formula (I) can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively<br>
mixtures of the various solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the compounds of formula (I) or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as well as a propellant. Such a preparation customarily contains the active compound in a concentration from approximately 0.1 to 50%, in particular from approximately 0.3 to 3% by weight.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ α-, ß- or -cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
Appropriate cyclodextrins are α-, ß- or -cyclodextrins (CDs) or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with C1-6alky1, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated ß-CD; hydroxyC1-6alkyl, particularly hydroxy-ethyl, hydroxypropyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyC1-6alkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxyethyl; C1-6alkyl-carbonyl, particularly acetyl; C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkyl or carboxyC1-6alkyloxyC1-6alkyl, particularly carboxymethoxypropyl or carboxyethoxy-propyl; C1-6alkylcarbonyloxyC1-6alkyl, particularly 2-acetyloxypropyI. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are P-CD, randomly methylated ß-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-ß-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-ß-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl--CD, 2-hydroxypropyl--CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-ß-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-CD (2-HP-ß-CD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxypropyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
An interesting way of formulating the present compounds in combination with a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof has been described in EP-A-721,331. Although the formulations described therein are with antifungal active ingredients, they are equally interesting for formulating the compounds of the present invention. The formulations<br>
described therein are particularly suitable for oral administration and comprise an antifungal as active ingredient, a sufficient amount of a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof as a solubilizer, an aqueous acidic medium as bulk liquid carrier and an alcoholic co-solvent that greatly simplifies the preparation of the composition. Said formulations may also be rendered more palatable by adding pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners and/or flavors.<br>
Other convenient ways to enhance the solubility of the compounds of the present invention in pharmaceutical compositions are described in WO-94/05263, W098/42318, EP-A-499,299 and WO 97/44014, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
More in particular, the present compounds may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles consisting of a solid dispersion comprising (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) one or more pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermodynamics, such a solid dispersion is referred to as "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase.<br>
The water-soluble polymer in the particles is conveniently a polymer that has an apparent viscosity of 1 to 100 mPa.s when dissolved in a 2 % aqueous solution at 20°C solution.<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses or HPMC. HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether groups present per anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxypropyl molar substitution refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which<br>
have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule.<br>
The particles as defined hereinabove can be prepared by first preparing a solid dispersion of the components, and then optionally grinding or milling that dispersion. Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation, melt-extrusion being preferred.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the present compounds in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the surface of the antiretroviral agent but do not chemically bond to the antiretroviral agent.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the present compounds involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the present compounds are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition with good bioavailability which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise (a) a central, rounded or spherical core, (b) a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and an antiretroviral agent and (c) a seal-coating polymer layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and sacC1-6arides and derivatives thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a kit or container comprising a compound of formula (I) in an amount effective for use as a standard or reagent in a test or assay for determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit HIV protease, HIV growth, or both. This aspect of the invention may find its use in pharmaceutical research programs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in phenotypic resistance<br>
monitoring assays, such as known recombinant assays, in the clinical management of resistance developing diseases such as HIV. A particularly useful resistance monitoring system is a recombinant assay known as the Antivirogram™. The Antivirogram™ is a highly automated, high throughput, second generation, recombinant assay that can measure susceptibility, especially viral susceptibility, to the compounds of the present invention. (Hertogs K, de Bethune MP, Miller V et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1998; 42(2):269-276, incorporated by reference).<br>
The dose of the present compounds or of the physiologically tolerable salt(s) thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted to the conditions of the individual case for an optimum effect. Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the infection and symptoms, and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of formula (I) in the case of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is 0.1 mg to 10 g, preferably 1 mg to lg, more preferably 3 mg to 0.5 g. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose, or divided into several, e.g. two, three, or four, individual doses.<br>
The following tables list the compounds of formula (I) which were prepared following one of the above reaction schemes. ND means not determined.<br>

Antiviral analyses:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were examined for anti-viral activity in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that these compounds exhibited potent anti-HIV activity against a wild type laboratory HIV strain (HIV-1 strain LAI). The cellular assay was performed according to the following procedure. HIV- or mock-infected MT4 cells were incubated for five days in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor. At the end of the incubation period, all HIV-infected cells have been killed by the replicating virus in the control cultures in the absence of any inhibitor. Cell viability is measured by measuring the concentration of MTT, a yellow, water soluble tetrazolium dye that is converted to a purple, water insoluble formazan in the mitochondria of living cells only. Upon solubilization of the resulting formazan crystals with isopropanol, the absorbance of the solution is<br>
monitored at 540nm. The values correlate directly to the number of living cells remaining in the culture at the completion of the five day incubation. The inhibitory activity of the compound was monitored on the virus-infected cells and was expressed as IC50 and IC90. These values represent the amount of the compound required to protect 50% and 90%, respectively, of the cells from the cytopathogenic effect of the virus. The toxicity of the compound was measured on the mock-infected cells and was expressed as CC50, which represents the concentration of compound required to inhibit the growth of the cells by 50%. The selectivity index (SI) (ratio CC50/TC50) is an indication of the selectivity of the anti-HIV activity of the inhibitor. Wherever results are reported as e.g. pIC50 or pCC50 values, the result is expressed as the negative logarithm of the result expressed as IC50 or CC50 respectively.<br>
Antiviral spectrum:<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HIV strains, the present compounds were tested for their potency against clinically isolated HIV strains harboring several mutations. These mutations are associated with resistance to protease inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently commercially available drugs such as for instance saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir and amprenavir. The viral strains R13025, R13027, R13028, R13029, R13034, R13080, T13127 and R13363 contained mutations as indicated below in Table 3.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Results:<br>
As a measure of the broad spectrum activity of the present compounds, the fold resistance (FR), defined as FR = IC50(mutant strain)/IC50(HIV-l strain LAI), was determined. Table 4 shows the results of the antiviral testing in terms of fold resistance. As can be seen in this table, the present compounds are effective in inhibiting a broad range of mutant strains: Column A FR value towards mutant A; Column B: FR towards mutant B; Column C: FR towards mutant C; Column D: FR towards mutant D; Column E: FR towards mutant E; Column F: FR towards mutant F; Column G: FR towards mutant G; Column H: FR towards mutant H. The toxicity (column Tox) is expressed as the pCC50 value as determined with mock transfected cells. Column WT displays the pIC50 value against wild type HIV-LAI strain.<br>

Biovailability:<br>
Caco-2 permeability assay for intestinal absorption<br>
The permeability of different compounds is evaluated according to a Caco-2 test protocol as described by Augustijns et al. (Augustijns et al. (1998). Int. J. of Pharm, 166, 45-54) whereby, Caco-2 cells at cell passage number between 32 and 45 are grown in 24-well transwell cell culture plates for 21 to 25 days. The integrity of the cell monolayer is checked by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The test is performed at pH 7.4 and at 100 uM donor compound concentration.<br>
Aqueous solubility at different pH levels<br>
The equilibrium solubility in simulated gastrointestinal solutions under thermodynamic conditions is a good measure for the solubility profile of the compound in the stomach and the different parts of the intestine. Simulated gastric fluid (SGF) (without pepsin) is set at pH of 1.5. Simulated intestinal fluids (SIF) (without bile salts) are set at pH 5, pH 6.5, pH 7 and pH 7.5. The experimental protocol uses 96-well flat-bottom microplates in which 1 mg of compound is added per well (stock solution in methanol) and evaporated to dryness. The compounds are resolubilized in SGF and SIF and incubated overnight on a horizontal shaking device at 37°C. After filtration, the compound concentrations are determined by UV-spectrophotometry.<br>
Oral availability in the rat<br>
The compounds are formulated as a 20 mg/ml solution or suspension in DMSO, PEG400 or cyclodextin 40% in water. For most experiments in the rat (male and female rats), three dosing groups are formed: 1/ single intraperitoneal (IP) dose at 20 mg/kg using DMSO formulation; 2/ single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using PEG400 formulation and 3/ single oral dose at 20 mg/kg using PEG400 formulation. Blood is sampled at regular time intervals after dosing and drug concentrations in the serum are determined using a LC-MS bioanalytical method. Serum concentrations are expressed in ng/mg. Serum concentration at 30 minutes (30') and at 3 hours (180') can be determined as these values reflect the extent of absorption (30') and the speed of elimination (180'). The rat serum concentration at 30 min and 180 min following IP administration of 20 mg/kg of compound 18 are 2012 ng/ml and 190 ng/ml respectively. The rat serum concentration at 30 min and 180 min following oral administration of 20 mg/kg as a DMSO formulation of compound 18 are 148 ng/ml and 44 ng/ml respectively; whereas in PEG400 said concentrations are respectively 475 ng/ml and 63 ng/ml.<br>
Boosting the systemic bioavailability<br>
With the described type of compounds (protease-inhibitors), it is known that inhibition of the metabolic degradation processes can markedly increase the systemic availability<br><br>
by reducing the first-pass metabolism in the liver and the metabolic clearance from the plasma. This 'boosting' principle can be applied in a clinical setting to the pharmacological action of the drug. This principle can be also explored both in the rat or the dog by simultaneous administration of a compound that inhibits the Cyt-p450 metabolic enzymes. Known blockers are for example ritonavir and ketoconazole. Dosing a single oral dose of ritonvir at 5 mg/kg in the rat and the dog may result in an increase of the systemic availability.<br>
Protein Binding analyses:<br>
Human serum proteins like albumin (HSA) or alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) are known to bind many drugs, resulting in a possible decrease in the effectiveness of those compounds. In order to determine whether the present compounds would be adversely effected by this binding, the anti-HIV activity of the compounds was measured in the presence of human serum, thus evaluating the effect of the binding of the protease inhibitors to those proteins.<br>
Film-coated Tablets<br>
Preparation of Tablet Core<br>
A mixture of 100 g of active ingredient, in casu a compound of formula (I), 570 g lactose and 200 g starch was mixed well and thereafter humidified with a solution of 5 g sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 g polyvinylpyrrolidone in about 200 ml of water. The wet powder mixture was sieved, dried and sieved again. Then there was added 100 g microcrystalline cellulose and 15 g hydrogenated vegetable oil. The whole was mixed well and compressed into tablets, giving 10.000 tablets, each comprising 10 mg of the active ingredient. Coating<br>
To a solution of 10 g methylceliulose in 75 ml of denaturated ethanol there was added a solution of 5 g of ethylcellulose in 150 ml of dichloromethane. Then there were added 75 ml of dichloromethane and 2.5 ml 1,2,3-propanetriol. 10 g of polyethylene glycol was molten and dissolved in 75 ml of dichloromethane. The latter solution was added to the former and then there were added 2.5 g of magnesium octadecanoate, 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 30 ml of concentrated color suspension and the whole was homogenated. The tablet cores were coated with the thus obtained mixture in a coating apparatus.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
