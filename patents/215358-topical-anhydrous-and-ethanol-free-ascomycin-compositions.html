				<td>Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The invention relates to topical pharmaceutical compositions comprising an ascomycin for the treatment of skin disorders, in the form of a single-phase liquid or semi-solid composition substantially free of ethanol and water.<br>
Ascomycins such as ascomycin itself or derivatives thereof are examples of compounds of the FK 506 class. FK506 (tacrolimus) is a known macrolide antibiotic that is produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis No. 9993. It is also a potent immunosuppressant. The structure of FK506 is given in The Merck Index 12th Edition (1996) on p. 546 as entry 9200. Methods of preparing FK506 are described in e.g. EP 184162.<br>
A large number of derivatives, antagonists, agonists and analogues of FK506, which retain the basic structure and at least one of the biological properties (for example the immunological properties) of FK506, are now known. These compounds are described in a large number of publications, for example EP 184162, EP 315978, EP 323042, EP 423714, EP 427680, EP 465426, EP 474126, WO 91/13889, WO 91/19495, EP 484936, EP 532088, EP 532089, EP 569337, EP 626385 and WO 93/5059. Ascomycin and derivatives thereof, including FK506, are referred to hereinafter as "ascomycins".<br>
Ascomycins are known to be indicated for use in e.g. the topical treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated illnesses. The condition of the skin to be treated may vary e.g. with kind and grade of disease; e.g. the skin may be dry or fatty skin. Furthermore, the skin to be treated may be haired. There is a need for a pharmaceutical composition that may be applied to the skin substantially independently of the condition of the skin.<br>
It has now been found that an ascomycin can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a single-phase liquid or semi-solid topical formulation substantially free of ethanol and water. These pharmaceutical compositions are effective independently of the condition of the skin, nail or mucosa, are well tolerated, stable and have particularly interesting penetration properties.<br><br>
They surprisingly retain and improve on the beneficial penetration properties of more complex or inhomogenous formulations such as water- or hydrocarbon-based emulsions or suspensions, while being particularly convenient in terms of ease of administration and patient compliance.<br>
Thus it has been found that a large part of the bulk of the compositions, at least 40% w/w, can consist of simple solvents, resulting in easily-applicable, clear liquid solutions or thickened, semi-solid solutions.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides single-phase topical liquid or semiÂ¬solid pharmaceutical composition substantially free of ethanol and water which comprises an ascomycin in a carrier vehicle comprising a 3-component solvent mixture amounting to at least 40% w/w of the total weight of the composition and consisting of :<br>
i)        one or more of a C3-8 alkanol and C1-8 alkanediol; ii)       a fatty alcohol; and iii)      one or more of a further solvent selected from :<br>
a)	a C12-24 alkane carboxylic acid C2-3 alkyl ester and C2-10 alkane dicarboxylic acid C2-3 alkyl ester;<br>
b)	pharmaceutically acceptable ether diol; a diether alcohol; a di-or partial ether of a low molecular weight mono- or polyoxyalkanediol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, triethyl citrate, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylisosorbide, and propylene carbonate, and<br>
c)	a triglyceride;<br>
and optionally futher conventional excipients.<br>
hereinafter briefly named "the compositions of the invention".<br><br>
The compositions of the invention have the advantage they consist of few components, are straightforward to prepare and are well-tolerated on human skin.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be e.g. in the form of a topical solution or a spray solution, a gel, a foam or an ointment, preferably they are in the form of a gel, a foam or an ointment.<br>
Semi-solid or foamy compositions are preferred.<br>
"Single-phase" means herein that the compositions of the invention are other than multiphasic e.g. other than two-phase systems such as creams or emulsions; they may be in any single-phase form e.g. as a solution or spray solution, a gel, an ointment, or e.g. the liquid component of a foam, whereby the active ingredient normally is in dissolved form.<br>
"Liquid or semi-liquid" means that the compositions of the invention are essentially solutions in liquid or solidified liquid form.<br><br>
"Substantially free of ethanol and water" means that neither ethanol nor water is added as an intentional constituent part of the compositions of the invention. However, e.g. a small amount of humidity, e.g. up to about 1 % water w/w, may nevertheless be present, e.g. as an intrinsic impurity in some of the excipients used, or as part of the active ingredient when this is e.g. a hydrate, e.g. when crystal form A (see WO 99/01458) of compound A hereinafter is used.<br>
A particularly beneficial aspect of the compositions of the invention is that while the components of the above 3-component solvent mixture are solubilizing agents, they additionally may possess penetration enhancing properties, thus contributing to keeping the formulations both simple and effective. Further, it has been found that the solutions may be thickened without any apparent loss in efficacy.<br>

The compositions of the invention may optionally comprise further conventional excipients, e.g., for easier application, a thickened solution may be desirable, e.g. a semi-solid solution or a fluid-gel or a transparent gel. This can be achieved by adding conventional consistency agents (viscosity-enhancing agents) to enhance the viscosity of the compositions.<br>
Suitable consistency agents include e.g.:<br>

The compositions of the invention preferably are devoid of surfactant, except as required during processing to e.g. a foam formulation, and are substantially free of ethanol and water, as defined above.<br>
For the treatment of fatty or hairy skin, non-greasy formulations are preferred, such as provided in e.g. Examples 1 to 17,22 and 23 hereunder. Absence of greasiness and low residue upon application may lead to increased convenience especially on haired skin.<br>
The components of the compositions of the invention are described in i.a. H.P. Fiedler, "Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende Gebiete", Editio Cantor Verlag Aulendorf, Aulendorf, 4th revised and expanded edition (1996), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Particularly preferred are compositions of the invention wherein the ascomycin is e.g. pimecrolimus and<br>
-	component i) is isopropanol and/or hexylene glycol;<br>
-	component ii) is oleyl alcohol; and<br>
-	component iii) is:<br><br>
a)	diisopropyl adipate and/or isopropyl myristate and/or<br>
b)	dimethyl isosorbide and/or<br>
c)	medium-chain triglycerides;<br>
and optionally further conventional excipients;<br>
especially the compositions of Examples 17 to 20 and 23, particularly Example 17 hereunder.<br>
The compositions of the invention are indicated for use in the treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases. The terms "skin" and "cutaneous" should be understood broadly as comprising also diseases of e.g. nail or mucosa. Examples of immunologically-mediated diseases include alopecia areata, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa, urticaria, angioedemas, vasculitides, erythemas, cutaneous eosinophilias, and lupus erythematous. Examples of skin diseases include dermatomyositis, leukoderma vulgaris, ichthyosis vulgaris, photoallergic sensitivity, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, acne, autoimmune diseases such as chronic rheumatoid arthritis, scleoderma and the like.<br><br>
The invention farther provides a composition as defined above for use in the treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases.<br>
It further provides a method for treating inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases or cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases comprising administering a composition of the invention to the skin of a patient in need thereof.<br>
Still further, it provides the use of a composition of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases.<br>
It further provides the use of a carrier vehicle as defined above to enhance penetration of an ascomycin into human skin, nail or mucosa.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be prepared in conventional manner by working up the components into a pharmaceutical composition. For example, the compositions of the invention may be obtained by dissolving an ascomycin in a pharmaceutically acceptable alkanol, e.g. a C3-8 alkanol, a C1-8 alkanediol and/or a fatty alcohol. Other components, e.g. alkane carboxylic alkyl esters and/or alkane dicarboxylic esters, and/or hydrophilic co-components, triglycerides and optional further conventional excipients, may be added at the appropriate time as is conventional.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention. They are not limitative.<br>
All percentages referred to herein are weight/weight (% w/w) except where otherwise indicated. The term "stable" should be understood to mean that no separation of components of the respective composition is observed when stored at room temperature for a period of at least 3 months or longer and that there is no decomposition of active agent. However, some unintentional crystallization may occasionally take place e.g. upon storage, and the presence of a small amount of active ingredient in crystallized form in the compositions of the invention should thus be understood to still fall within the ambit of the invention.<br>
Chemical analysis of the active agent is undertaken using reverse phase HPLC with UV detection; X = 210 nm. Quantification limit is 0.1 % by weight.<br>
In Examples 1 to 25, Compound A (pimecrolimus) may be replaced with Compound B; Compound C; tacrolimus; L-733725; L-732531; andABT-281.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The utility of the compositions of the invention can be observed in standard clinical tests such as the test set out below using a concentration of 0.005 % to 10 % w/w (preferably 0.1 % to 3 % w/w) of the active agent.<br>
A representative clinical trial is carried out as follows:<br>
A randomised double-blind, vehicle-controlled within-patient study comparing the composition of the invention at a dose of 0.1 % to 3 % by weight (based on the total weight of the composition) active agent on the diseased skin area, e.g. 200 cm2, corresponding to about 0.5 to 50 mg/cm2, preferably 1 to 10 mg/cm2 of composition, and placebo on the diseased skin area as positive control is performed in patients suffering from inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases or of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases.<br>
The patients are treated with the composition twice daily for six months. The therapeutic effect is evaluated and the time to partial clearance is used for efficacy. Local tolerability of study medications and routine safety parameters, including haematology and clinical chemistry, are recorded.<br>
The utility can also be observed using the established assay of experimentally induced allergic contact dermatitis in young domestic pigs (J. Investig. Dermatol. 98 [1992] 851-855). Several formulations were tested for inhibition of inflammatory changes (intensity and extent of redness and infiltration) by clinical examination. Efficacy was evaluated by comparison of inflammatory changes in treated and untreated contralateral test sites in the same animals. Results obtained are as follows:<br><br><br>
The exact amount of composition of the invention to be administered depends on various factors, for example the desired duration of treatment and the rate of release of the active agent. Satisfactory results are obtained in larger mammals, for example humans, with the local application over the area to be treated of a 0.05 % to 10 % w/w, preferably 0.1 % to 3 %, concentration of the active agent once or several times a day (for example 2 to 5 times a day). In general the composition may be applied to areas of skin as small as 1 cm to as large as 0.5 m2, preferably the composition will be applied to the head area in the treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases or of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases. Suitable skin loadings of the active agent fall within the range of 0.005 mg/cm to 1 mg/cm .<br>
The compositions of the invention are found to be effective independently of the condition of the skin and are well tolerated on skin. They may be easily applied to large areas of skin using a conventional applicator, e.g. brush, cotton pad, filament, topical spray or roller ball applicator, and are thus very convenient in use.<br><br><br>
