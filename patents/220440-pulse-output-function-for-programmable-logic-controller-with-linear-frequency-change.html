Bacl^roimd<br>
Programmable logic controUcrs can be si^Ued widi some means offaododng pulsed outputs on their dUcrete output points that can be used for controlling the motion of stepper motors, pulse input controlled servo-motor controllers, and/or for other equipment that is controlled by sn input pube ftequency, pnlse width, and/or numba of pulses.<br>
A desired motion profit can be described in tcnns of desired pulse frequency versus time. Such profiles can be used in industry to descnbc, for exan^le, the speed of a motor positioning a tool, where the frequency of pulses delivn«d to the motor system controU the rotational speed. Typical motor systems used in industry today have scaling factors of from 200 to 200000 puLses per revolution. Typical acceleration times from niinimuin to maximum frequency can range from a few milliseconds up to many seconds. The actual object of the modon is often to move a specific distance, expressed as a specific number of pulses, while satisfying constraints on acceleration, and change in acceleratioTi. The constraints on acc^eratipn and change in acc^eration can have any of noxDotius motivations, including controlling motcr torque load, limiting wear on drive trains, avoiding damage to tools, work pieces, and/or handled maiexials, and/or limiting acoostic noise, etc. Controlled changes in acceleration ml^t or might<br><br>
not be included in a particular application, but are incawasingly valued as users strive f(x higher speed Tnovemeat without introducing difiruptive jerks.<br>
Summary<br>

Deffaiitioiis<br>
When the following teims are used herein, fte accon^anying definitions ^y:<br><br>
pTOgrammable lo^c controller (PLQ - a device that follows<br>
programmed instructions to provide automated monitociTig and/or control<br>
functions over a machine and/or process by evaluating a set of inputs. A<br>
PLC can be used to automate con^lex functions, foi example, in<br>
machining, packaging, materials handling, aad/oc other qiplications. A<br>
PLC can be utilized to control an industrial process.<br>
pulse - a transient wave coc^nising a voltage of a predetermined<br>
amplitude that extends for a piedeteimined time period.<br>
pulse train - a series of pulses that can control the operation of a motion<br>
device, e.g., a motion controller, such as a stepper motor control!^, a<br>
servo controller, an actuator coDtroUer, etc.; a motion drive, such as a<br>
stepper drive, servo drive, etc.; and/or a actuator, such as a stepper<br>
motor, servomotor, linear motor, motOT, ball screw, servo valve,<br>
hydraulic actuator, pneumatic valve, etc. The motion device can<br>
interpret 4ie number, fiequestcy, and/or length of pulses as commands for<br>
certain movements.<br>
pulse generator - a device that generates pulses.<br>
pulsed outputs - a series of pulses provided from a device.<br>
frequency - the number of times a specified periodic phenomeDOii<br>
occurs within a specified interval. For wcample, a pulse frequency could<br>
vary from 1 pulse per second to 10,000 pulses per second. TTie<br>
frequency of a pulse train applied to a motion controUed system will<br>
typically be proportional to the velocity of the motion device, and thus<br>
the trams frequency (of the pulse train) and velocity (of the motion<br>
device) are used interchangeably herein.<br>
acceleration - a change in frequency with respect to time.<br>
)erk - a change in acceleration with respea to time.<br><br>
Unear-time-rate Tariation - a change of a pulse vsriable (e.g., frequency, acceleration, jerk, etc.) with respect to time, characterized by a constant increment of change per unit time. poise frequency output profile - a representation (e.g., graphical, tabular, etc.) of a desired variation of pulse frequency with respect to time or pulse count, or an equivalent r^iresentation, such as a r^resentation of five velocity and position of a motion device whereby veloci^ is related to a pulse frequency and position is related to a pulse count. For example, a pulse frequency output profile could specify ttiat for the first 500 pulses of operation, the pulse firequency should rncrease from 10 pulses per second to 100 pulses per second, &amp;nd afterwards remain constant for the next 300 pulses, then decrease at a specified rate, with pulse ou^ut to stop after reaching 20 pulses per second. A poise frequency output profile as a whole can be considered a specification and/or can be considered a collection of speraficotions, each specification relating to one or more constituent of the profile, such as a line segment spedficatioa - a description or characterization. line segment - a portion of a pulse frequency output profile that is characterized, or specified, by certain parameters such as an initial frequency, an initial acceleration, and a change in acceleration with respect to time, and a specification of how the line segment ends. The specification of how a line segment ends can be ctan^ietiix] of a specific pulse count, or the reaching of a specific fr^uency goal, or some external event<br>
polarity of diange - whether a rate of change is positive or negative. automatically - acting or opiating in a manner essentially independent of external influence cr control. For example, an automatic li^l swiitii<br><br>
can turn on upon "aedng" ia person in its view, without the person manuaUy operating the li^t switch.<br>
Detuled Description<br>
Certain exemplary embodin«aits provide a pulse output fiinctioo for a programmable logic controller. The pulse ou^ut function can provide a naeans for producing a user speciiied firequency of pulses, for varyrcig die pulse frequency according to a u.ser spebiCied linear rote of change with tiine (constant acceleration), and/or for varying the frequency in response to a user spedfied linear variation in acceleration witn respect to time. The function can provide for user specified pulse frequency output profiles consisting of an indefinitely large and inde&amp;nitely intraiuixed .sequence of line segments, each line segment represtating an incieasing frequency, decreasing frequency, and/or constant frequency ou^ut The frequency magnitude, rate, and polarity of change in frequency, andrate and polarity of change in acceleration can be indejwndently specified for each line segment- The length of each line segment can be independently specified as a number of pulses, as an indefinite length to be tKminated by an external event, and/or as an indefinite length to be tenninated by reaching a specific frequency igoal. The c^eration of a specified line segment can be intexrupted (as, for examplle, by an emergency stop function)- On such line segment interruption, the pulse output can be almq)tly terminated, and/or a transition can be endued to a newly specified line segment (as, for exan^le, an item in an emergency shul-dowi^ sequence) ^^ithout ^scontlnuities in the pulse generation.<br><br>
Progranunable logic controllers can be supplied with some means of producing pulsed outputs on their discrete ou^ut points that can be used for controlling stepper motors, pulse input controlled servo-motor controllers, and/or for other equipment that is controUed by an input puise frequency, pulse width, and^or number of pulses. Prograinraable logic controllers ctai focus on usa specification of pulse width as a simple implementation. Programmable logic controllers can include a means for delivering a sequence of user specifications so as to produce a desired profile of pulse width outputs. Programmable logic controllers can include a means of intei3)0lating changes in pulse width betwecii specification points so as to reduce generally undesircd discontinuities in pulse width while foUowin^ a specified ramped change in pulse width.<br>
It is recognized that pulse width is inversely related to frequency. Mechanisms that depend on pulse widtii and change in pulse width specification can be inconvenient to use when the user desired specification is in frequency and change in frequency. In particular, in attenqiting to describe frequaicy changes wi&amp; respect to time (accelo^tion), and changes in accelo^ticm with respect to time, the use of pulse widfli and change in pulse width specificatiwis can require an inconveniently large number of points to describe a line segment with sufficient accuracy.<br>
The arithmetic operations required for conqiuting frequency targets acccwding to typical desired rules and converting these frequency targets to pulse widths are reasonably simple. Typical programmable logic controllers for low cost applications have limited available processing power. Certain applications can require pulse output frequences of hundreds of KHz to MHz. Catain applications do not allow sufficient time for accderation change, frequency<br><br>
(diange, and frequency-to-pulse widQi convereion calculations to be performed as needed on a pulse by pulse basis by a typical programmable logic controller.<br>
Cotoiti exemplary embodiments can provide dedicaied logic to peifiiiim these calculations, coupled with input data pipelining mechanisms to allow a consistent supply of timely new data, and state machine logic to manage the calculations, deliver concct calculation results to the pulse generaior, and manage transitions between desired operating modes. The dedicated logic can use fixed point calculations rather than the generally more complicated and more expensive floating point calculation mechaninns. In pardcular, the coaptation of target frequency and target acceleratiDn at a particular time can be carried out as a cumnlative addition of incremental changes. By allowing the rate of such cumulative additions to be independently specified, the fixed point additions can be scaled to cover a range of frequency/time/rate of change values that might otttcrwise require excessive vord length or floating point calculation hardware.<br>

In crataio exemplary embodiments, via one or more usw- interfaces 3600, such as a gr(q&gt;hical user int«f ace, a user can provide a desired motion profile.<br><br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram of an exemplary t&gt;7ical desired motion profile 4000, described in terms of desired piOse frequency versos tune. Such profiles can be used in industry to describe, for example, the speed of a motor positiomng a tool, where tfie frequency of pulses delivered to the motcM- system controls the rotational speed. Typical motor systems used in industry tod&amp;y have scaling factors of horn 200 to 200000 pulses p=r revolution. T&gt;pJcaI acceleraa'on times from minimum to maximum frequ^cy ca.n range from a few milliseconds up to many seconds. The actual object of the motioi) is often to move a specific distance, expressed as a specific number of pulses, while satisfying constraints on acceleration, and change in acceleration. The constraints on acceLoration and change in acceleration can have any of numerous motivations, including controlling motes torque load, limiting wear on drive trains, avoiding damage to toolst work pieces, and/or handled materials, and/or limiting acoustic noise, etc. Controlled changes in acceleration, represented by &amp;e carved portions of the illustrative profile, might or might not be included in a particular application, but are increasingly valued as users strive for hig^ speed movement without introducing disruptive jerks.<br>
The motion represented by die profile in Bg. 4 can start and stop with abrupt changes between 0 and some minimum finite frequency. This can be minimally required by the nature of the system, since frequency can be expressed as a series of finite width pulses. Further, typical motors have minimum stait and stop speeds of, for example, $% or 10% of maximum rated speed, below which imnimums the motor might stall or operate erratically. After Hie initial step to the minimum start frequency, acceleration can be sowothly increased to some maximum amoimt, then can be smoothly decreased to zero to achieve a constant speed at the top of the profile, followed by a similar reverse process to smooflily<br><br>
slow down to Tninimum speed and stop. As used hoein, a factor df means a (jiangc in fi^ueocy per uiiit time, and a factor ddf describes a cbaage in df per unit time- That is, dft^resents an acceleration and ddfarate of change in acceleration.<br>
Within motion profile 4000 can be a number of regimes 4100-4900, which can be comprised of one or more line segments, and which can be described as follows:<br>
4100". motion starts with some minimuni non-zero start frequency;<br>
4200: df &gt; 0 and ddf &gt; 0, frequency (fn+i = fn+df) and accelenttiaii<br>
(df„4.i = dfn +ddf) are increasing, updated at regular intravals to as<br>
specified in the time interval portion of the df specification;<br>
4300: df &gt; 0, ddf = 0, frequency is increasing at constant accderation;<br>
4400: df &gt; 0, ddf 
reduced;<br>
4500: df = 0, ddf = 0, frequency is constant;<br>
4600: df 
and gromrg in magnitude;<br>
4700: df 
4800: df  0, frequency is decreasing, accclcratiOQ is negative<br>
and decreasing in magnitode; and<br>
4900; motion reaches some final minimuni frequency, th«i stops-<br>
Parameters of each line segment can be indqwndently specified or maintained from a previous segment This example is deliberately asymmetrical to illustrate flKubility of line segment descaiption. The number of line segmente can be indefinit^y extensible, and can loaded from some external storage. The term<br><br>
"line BBgment" means a portion of the curve, whether os not straight, controlled by a single load &amp;om the pipeline registers.<br>
Although Rg. 4 repiesents a simple motion profile of start, speed up to scHne constant frequency, slow down, and stop, much more conjilicHted profiles may be required in practice and can be accommodated. Such profiles mi^t include multiple intervals of constant speed, connected by intervening accelerations of different migaitaics, and peiiiaps including segments that are indefinitely extended, requiring some external signal or external data input to the system to determine the timing and nature of a next step. Parameters for each segment of the profile can be independently specified, or maintained fiom the previous segment, allowing for considerable flexibility in application.<br>

The linear ramp Pulse Train Output (Ipto) systtra can allow specification of the pulse train in terms of frequracy and change in frequency per unit time.  The modes of operation can be as follows:<br><br>
Major operatmg modes:<br>
nin_st^s_n: nm for a specified npjnber of pulses, siarting from a<br>
specified frequency and changmg tiie frequency at a specified rate per<br>
unit time. At the conipletion of the pulse count, load a new step<br>
specification.<br>

specii&gt;iiig the interval at which thtf addition takes place, this register is<br>
accessed by firmware by loading Ac dfh (delta frequency pipeline). The<br>
signed addition wf c= wf + dfjnagnitude, repeated at regular counted<br>

Basic Operation<br>
Processor loads src_f, the frequency of the system clock available to<br>
measure pulse width as a Diind&gt;a of counted clocks. src_f is presumed<br>
to remain constant for a complete motiDn. src_f may be fixed for a<br>
system or provided as some selectable clock source.<br>
Processor loads die remaining data pipeline registers, wfh, dfii, ddfli, and<br>
cmpA as desired, and writes a xfr_pipeline command to load the<br>
working registers wf, df, ddf, cmpr. Typically die pipeline registers are<br>
now written with a second set of values to be ready for the next line<br>
segment.<br>
The initial working frequency specification, wf, is loaded to the divider.<br>
The divider determines a first pulse width specification by dividing 8K:_f<br>
/ wf. The division result is loaded to a buffered pulse width specification<br>
registw, pw.<br>
On commaDd to start, the pulse width counts obtains the value of pw,<br>
and begins producing pulses by counting clocks. Each output pulse is<br>
hi^ for approximately one-half the specified pw count, and low for die<br>
remaindw: of the pw count At the completioo of each pw cotmt, a new<br>
value of the buffered pw from the divider is fetched and another ptdse<br>
widdi is counted out.<br>
Concurrent with the counting out of pulse widths, anintarval timeris<br>
marldiig update events as specified by the time specification portion of<br>
the df register. On each update event, wf is loaded with a new value of<br><br>
wf + df, df is loaded with a new value of df + ddf. This regular addition of df and ddf increments at equidistant times performs the calculations'.<br>
wf=wf(0) + df *tiine<br>
df=df{0) + ddf*tiniE<br>
widi the accuniijlation of scaled, fixed point additions being<br>
substituted for multiplications. Each new fi:equMc&gt; value wf is loaded to the divider, which prodttces a new pulse width specification pw = src_f / wf.  The latest value of pw is available to the pulso width connte* to use for timing the ne*t pulse on each pulse boundary. Note that pulse wid&amp;s are changing throughout a sequence, while the update interval is fixed. New values of pw may be presented at any lime daring a pulse, and may be replaced by yet new values before the next pulse start requires a new pw. Synchronous machinery assures that anly valid values of pw are transferred to the pulse width counter.<br>
This operatian continues until the end of a line segment.  Depca^xie on the mode of operation, the end of &amp;e line segment is masked by :<br>
completing a specified number of pulses, as counted down in the<br>
cmpr register (nin_steps_n or last_5tep_n)<br>
wf reaching a frequency as specified in the ermpi register<br>
Cnin_steps_f or last_stq)_0, or<br>
a x&amp; japdine conunand frwn the processOT. the normal escape<br>
&amp;om a run_continuous segment,<br>
the processor commanding an abort, an error escape fit«n any<br>
mode. On completion of a run_steps_n or j\ra_st(q)s_f segment, new speaficaiions from the pipdine registers arc loaded to The working<br><br>
registers, the new line segment commences, and the processor is notified so diat new pipeline register values may be loaded for yet another line segment if aesired. Additional line segments, vrith possible changes in mode carried in their specifications, may be loaded indefinitely. On conqjletion of a last,step_n or last^stcp^f, the pulse widfli counter is commanded to stop issuing pulses on the con^letion of a pulse, and the processor is notified of process completion. Additional line segments, with possible changes in mode carried in their specifications, may be loaded indefinitely.<br>
A xfr_pipeliD6 coimnand during run_continuous mode causes new line segment specifications to be loaded, which may include a change in mode. Typically this would be a ran_stcps_f line segment to transition to a new speed or a last_step_f segment to decelerate to a smooth slop. Additional line segments, with possible changes in mode carried in their specifications, may be loaded indefiiiitely.<br>
An abort command may be initiated as a response to interna] errors (e.g. an illegal result in a math c^wration). or external events (e.g., an unexpected shut down request in the largn- programmable log^c control system). The abort command stops (^ration of the update interval timer, the divider, and pipeline loads, readying ^ system to be set up for a new line segment. The pulse width counter continues to issue pulses al the last pw value specified, mmntaining the exttmal motor or other target device al a constant speed.  The processor may command an immediate stop, or, more typically, load a new Une segment specification in the pipe line registers and execute a xfr_ptpdine command to initiate the new segment The new line segment mi^tbe a smooth transilion to a new operating point or a smooth deceleration to stop.<br><br>
