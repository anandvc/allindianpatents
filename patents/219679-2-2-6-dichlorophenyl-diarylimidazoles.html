2-(2,6-Dichlorophenyl)-Diarylimidazoles<br>
This invention relates to new 2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-diarylimidazoles and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts. The compounds are protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, especially inhibitors of c-met kinase and are therefore excellent therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The invention relates also to pharmaceutical compositions which contain these new compounds as active agents for the treatment of cancer and cancer related diseases.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), enzymes that catalyse the transfer of the 7-phosphate of ATP to tyrosine residues of protein substrates, are critical components of signalling pathways that control cellular proliferation and differentiation. PTKs can be subdivided into two large families, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). RTKs span the plasma membrane and contain an extra-cellular domain, which binds ligand, and an intracellular portion, which possesses catalytic activity and regulatory sequences. Most RTKs, like the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-met possess a single polypeptide chain and are monomeric in the absence of ligand. Ligand binding to the extracellular portion of RTKs, leads to dimerisation of monomeric receptors resulting in autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion (for review see: Blume-Jensen, P., and Hunter, T., Nature 411 (2001) 355-365; Hubbard, S.R., et al, J. Biol. Chem. 273 (1998) 11987-11990; Zwick, E., et al., Trends Mol. Med. 8 (2002) 17-23). In general, tyrosine autophosphorylation either stimulates the intrinsic catalytic kinase activity of the receptor or generates recruitment sites for downstream signalling proteins containing phosphotyrosine-recognition domains, such as the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain.<br>
protein tyrosine kinases play a critical role in intracellular signal transduction pathways leading to diverse cellular responses such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation . Consequently these enzymes have become primary targets for the development of novel therapeutics designed to block cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis and promote apoptosis. The strategy that has progressed farthest in clinical development is the use of monoclonal antibodies to target<br><br>
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. The use of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors however could have significant theoretical advantages over monoclonal antibodies. Small molecule inhibitors could have better tissue penetration, could have activity against intracellular targets and mutated targets and could be designed to have oral bioavailability. Several lead compounds have shown promising activity against such targets as the EGFR, the vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor and bcr-abl.<br>
The hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-met was first identified as an activated oncogene in an N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidinic treated human osteogenic sarcoma cell line (M^NG-HOS) by its ability to transform NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The receptor encoded by the c-met protooncogene (located on chromosome 7) is a two-chain protein composed of 50 kDa(a) chain disulfide linked to a 145 kDa(p) chain in an a(3 complex of 190 kDa. The a chain is exposed at the cell surface whilst the (5 chain spans the cell membrane and possesses an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of this intracellular tyrosine kinase domain groups c-met as a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family of cell surface molecules.<br>
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as Scatter Factor (SF), is a multifunctional cytokine that elicits diverse responses in different cells and tissues. Since its initial discovery and characterisation HGF/SF has been the subject of intense research, particularly regarding its role in cancer development and progression. Much evidence now points to its role as a regulator of carcinogenesis, cancer invasion and metastasis (for review see: Herynk, M.H., and Radinsky, R., In Vivo 14 (2000) 587-596; Jiang, W., et al., Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 29 (1999) 209-248; Longati, P., et al, Curr. Drug Targets 2 (2001)41-55; Maulik, G., et al., CytokineGrowth Factor Rev. 13 (2002) 41-59; Parr, C, and Jiang&gt; W.G., Histol. Histopathol. 16 (2001)251-268.<br>
HGF/SF binds to and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the mature c-met receptor (5 chain. Such events are thought to promote binding of intracellular signalling proteins containing src homology (SH) regions such as PLC-Y, Ras-GAP, PI-3 kinase pp60c'src and the GRB-2 Socs complex to the activated receptor. Each SH2-containing protein may activate a different subset of signalling phosphopeptides thus eliciting different responses within the cell.<br><br>
C-met mutations have been well-described in hereditary and sporadic human papillary renal carcinomas and have been reported in ovarian cancer, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and gastric cancer. C-met is also over-expressed in both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer cells, in breast, colon and prostate tumors. Since c-met appears to play an important role in oncogenesis of a variety of tumors, various inhibition strategies have been employed to therapeutically target this receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
The usefulness of inhibiting the protein-tyrosine kinase c-met for inhibiting tumor growth and invasion has been shown in many well documented preclinical experiments (e.g.: Abounader, R., et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 91 (1999) 1548-1556; Laterra, J., et al., Lab. Invest. 76 (1997) 565-577; Tomioka, D., Cancer Res. 61 2001) 7518-7524; Wang, R., et al., J. Cell Biology 153 (2001) 1023-1033).<br>
WO 96/18626 describes inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and c-met kinase which are derivatives of 2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-5-(pyridin-4yl)-lH-imidazole (examples 5, 6 and 55). However they show unfavorable cytochrome P450 interactions and also some undesirable physical properties like low bioavailability.<br>
It has now been found, that the 2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-5-(pyrimidin-4yl)-lH-imidazoles according to this invention avoid these disadvantages and show improved properties as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors.<br>

3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 28, 103-115), but this requires the use of highly toxic chlorine gas and leads to side products because of overoxidation. The procedure disclosed in this invention (example A2) avoids these disadvantages. 2,6-dichloro-4*hydroxybenzaldehyde can be prepared from 3,5-dichlorophenol by either a Reimer-Tiemann reaction (J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 72-83) or by a bromination/Grignard sequence (WO 01/44154). The Reimer-Tiemann<br><br>
procedure does not allow an economically preparation due to very low yields (
This invention provides an improved process for the manufacture of 2,6-dichloro-<br>
3-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2,6-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. This process is<br>
characterized by the metallation of protected 2,4-dichlorophenol or 3,5-<br>
dichlorophenol with a lithium base, followed by reaction with an ester or amide of<br>
formic acid and the deprotection and isolation of said compounds. A suitable<br>
lithium base is methyllithium, n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, t-butyllithium,<br>
lithiumdiisopropylamide or lithium bistrimethylsilylamide, prefered is<br>
butyllithium. An appropriate solvent is diethyl ether, tetrahydrofurane or 1,2-<br>
dimethoxyethane, preferred is tetrahydrofurane. The metallation step is performed<br>
at -100°C to -60°C, preferably at -80°C to -70°C. Suitable protecting groups are<br>
triisopropylsilanyl, t-butyldimethylsilanyl or phenyldimethylsilanyl, prefered is<br>
triiso-propylsilanyl. Suitable derivatives of formic acid are methyl formate,<br>
ethylformate, dimethylformamide or N-formylpiperidine, preferred is<br>
dimethylformamide. This procedure can also be applied for the manufacture of 2,6-<br>
dichloro-3-hydroxymethylbenzaldehyde	and	2,6-dichloro-4-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzaldehyde according to this invention.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein before refers to conventional acid-addition salts or base-addition salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of formula (I) and are formed from suitable non-toxic organic or inorganic acids or organic or inorganic bases. Sample acid-addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and those derived from organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, and the like. Sample base-addition salts include those derived from ammonium, potassium, sodium and, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, such as for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The chemical modification of a pharmaceutical compound (i.e., a drug) into a salt is a technique well known to pharmaceutical chemists to obtain improved physical and chemical<br><br>
stability, hygroscopicity, flowability and solubility of compounds (see, e.g., H. Ansel et. al, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 6th ed., (1995), pp. 196 and 1456-1457.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g., in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drag£es, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, drag£es and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br><br>
Because of their activity as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, preferably of c-met kinase, compounds of the general formula (I) are valuable ingredients of therapeutics aiming at the treatment of cancer and other diseases that correspond with enhanced expression of the c-met receptor or related kinase receptors. Typically compounds of the general formula (I) block the phosphorylation activity of c-met kinase with an IC50 of 0.5 nM to 5 ^M.<br>
Therefore the dosage of a compound according to this invention can vary within wide limits and will also have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg ^i day of a compound of general formula (I) or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily dosage may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br>
The following examples and preparations illustrate the invention but are not intended to limit its scope.<br>
