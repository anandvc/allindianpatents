U.S. Patent 4,673,798 U.S. Patent 4,203,101 U.S. Patent 4,517,757 U.S. Patent 5,290,998<br>
U.S. Patent 4,686,352 U.S. Patent 4,347,428 U.S. Patent 5,250,139 U.S. Patent 5,376,799<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an iron having a soleplate, a housing connected to the soleplate, and a control switch located inside the housing, characterized in that:<br>
a one-piece actuator having a first end stationarily connected to the housing and a second<br>
nio\ able end extending through an aperture in the housing and located in front of the control<br>
switch to actuate the control switch when the second end is depressed.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,  in an iron having a soleplate,  a housing connected to the soleplate,  and control circuitry located inside the housing, the improvement comprises an actuator located inside and connected to the housing, the actuator having a button section extending through an aperture in the housing for depression by a user, the button section being suitably located to actuate a switch of the control circuitry when the button section is depressed by the user, the button section having a light transmitting section located in a path of a signal light of the control circuitry.<br>
In accordarice with another embodiment of the present invention,  in an iron having a soleplate,  a housing connected to the soleplate,  and control circuitry located inside the housing, the inprovement comprises a combined switch actuator and signal light transmitting member connected to the housing.    The member is depressed by a user to actuate a switch of the control circuitry and transmits light from a signal light of the control circuitry to outside the housing.<br>
The foregoing aspects and other features of the invention are explained in the follcwing description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an iron kncwn in the prior art;<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional  view of the handle of the iron shown in Fig. 1 taken along line 2-2;<br>
Fig. 3 is a partial schematic cross-sectional view of a portion of an ircn incorporating features of the present invention at a rear end of the iron;<br>
Fig. 4 is a partial schematic cross-sectional view of some of the compoents shewn in Fig. 3 with the actuator moved to a depressed position; and<br>
Fig. 5 is an elevaticnal side view of the actuator shewn in Fig. 3 taken from direction A.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 shew an iron 1 known in the prior art that has a depressible button 2 on its handle 3. The button 2 is biased by a metal leaf spring 4 towards its undepressed position. The button 2 is made of plastic translucent material. Two light bulbs 5 (only one of which is shewn) connected to a circuit board 6 are located under the button 2. The leaf spring is fastened to the handle 3 by a fastener 7,<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, there is shewn a partial schematic cross-sectional view of a portion of an iron 10<br>
incorporating features of the present invention. Although the present invention will be described with reference to the single embodiment shown in the drawings, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various different forms of altemate embodiments. In addition, any suitable size, shape or type of elements or materials could be used.<br>
Ihe iron 10 includes a soleplate 12, a housing 14 and control circuitry 16. Ihe housing 14 is attached to the soleplate 12 and encloses the control circuitry 16. Ihe control circuitry 16 includes an automatic off module 18. In the embodiment shown, the module 18 is a time controlled module that turns the iron off after a predetermined or preset period of time, such as one hour after the iron is turned on.    However, the module could have any suitable type of control circuitry. Ihe module 18 includes light sources 20, 21, such as neon bulbs, and a switch 22. One of the two light sources 21 is provided to signal that electrical power is being supplied to the iron. Ihe other light source 20 is provided to signed that the thermostat is being supplied with electricity for powering the heating element (not shown). In an alternate embodiment only one of the light sources need be provided to signal that the power is on. In another alternate embodiment, more than two light sources could be provided. Ihe switch 22 is provided to reset the module 18 after the autonatic off feature has been activated.<br>
Referring also to Fig. 5, an actuator 24 of the iron 10 is shewn. Ihe actuator 24 is preferably comprised of a<br>
transparent plastic or polymer material. The actuator 24 has a first end 26 and a second end 28. The first end 26 has a general "L" shape. The seccnd end 28 forms a push button section for the actuator. The second end 28 has a pocket 30 and two light transmitting areas 32, 33 located at the botton and the top of the pocket 30. In an altemate embodiment, the pocket 30 need not be provided. In another altemate embodiment, more or less than two light transmitting areas could be provided. The rear of the pocket 30 forms a projection 42 at the back of the second end 28. Located between the two ends 26, 28 is an elongate center section 34. The center section 34 is deformable in a general cantilever fashion along its length.<br>
As seen in Fig. 3, the housing 14 includes a receiving area 36 and a slot 38. The receiving area 36 is suitably sized and shaped to have the first end 26 of the actuator 24 stationarily located therein. The first end 26 extends out of the receiving area 36 through the slot 38. In the embodiment shown, the receiving area 36 and slot 38 are formed in the rear end cover 15 of the housing 14. However, the receiving area and slot could be formed in another area of the housing; not necessarily in the rear end cover 15. In order to insert the first end 26 into the receiving area 36, the actuator 24 is positioned inside the rear end cover 15 before connection of the cover to the rest of the housing. The first end 26 slides into the receiving area 36 and the rear end cover 15 is then connected to the rest of the housing to complete the capture of the first end 26 in the area 36. When the rear end cover 15 is attached to the rest of the housing, the entrances to<br>
the area 36 and slot 38 are blocked by a skirt of the iron. Thus, the first end 26 is interlockingly stationarily ccrirvected to the housing without direct use of fasteners between the actuator and the housing. The rear end cover 15 also has a side aperture 40 at its front end. The side aperture 40 is suitably sized and shaped to receive the second end 28 of the actuator 24. More specifically, the outer side of the second end 28 projects out of the housing at the aperture 40 in its unactuated position shown in Fig. 3. As seen in Fig. 5, the actuator 24 has a general angled shape relative to the first end 26. This is because the rear end of the housing 14, Where the rear end cover is attached, has an angled shape.<br>
As noted above, the module 18 has two lights 20, 21. The lights 20, 21 are located on opposite sides of the switch 22; one above and one below. The lower light transmitting area 32 on the actuator's second end 28 is located in a path of light from the lower light source 20 to transmit that light outside of the housing 14. The upper light transmitting area 33 is located in a path of light from the upper light source 21 to transmit that light outside of the housing 14. The light transmitting areas 32, 33 can function as a lens because the actuator 24 is comprised of transparent material. In an altemate embodiment, the actuator could be comprised of translucent material, or the areas 32, 33 could be separate transparent or translucent members that are fixedly connected to the rest of the actuator. The pocket 30 has been provided in order to receive an insert 44 (see Fig. 4) therein. The insert 44 is preferably an qpaque meamber. The insert 44 insures that<br>
light from the two light sources 20, 21 is kept separate at the two light transmitting areas 32, 33. The insert is preferably permanently fixed to the actuator 24, such as by ultrasonic welding or snap-lock attachment. Alternatively, the insert need not be provided. The inside of the pocket 30 could be coated with a light blocking coating to prevent light at area 32 from traveling to area  33 or visa versa. There may be sane cross-over or bleed through of light to the wrong area 32, 33, but such cross-over or bleed through is limited. Alternatively, any suitable means could be used to insure that the two areas 32, 33 each respectively transmit light from only cane of the light sources 20, 21.<br>
Referring also to Fig. 4, the module 18, housing 14 and actuator 24 are shown with the actuator 24 in an actuated or depressed position. In order to actuate the actuator 24, a user merely depresses the second end 28 further into the housing 14. The projection 42, in the unactuated position shown in Fig. 3, is located on or very close to an end of a switch buttcn 46 of the switch 22. When the second end 28 of the actuator 24 is depressed, as shown in Fig. 4, the projection 42 depresses the switch buttcn 46 to thereby actuate the switch 22. Because the first end 26 of the actuator 24 is interlockingly staticnarily captured in the receiving area 36, the center section 34 of the actuator 24 deflects in a general cantilever fashicn. Because the actuator 24 is made of a resilient deflectable material, when the user releases the second end 28, the actuator 24 springs back to its positicn shown in Fig. 3. In a preferred embodiment the actuator 24 proximate the<br>
second end 28 can be preloaded agciinst the inside of the housing 14. When the switch 22 is actuated by the actuator 24, the module 18 is reset to cillow the iron to function again. Thus, the switch 22 merely resets the autcmatic off module 18. In an altemate embodiment, the switch 22 could also control the ON/OFF feature of the iron irrespective of whether the automatic off feature of the module 18 caused the iron to automatically turn OFF.<br>
In alternate embodiments, the actuator could have any suitable shape. However, the one-piece nature of the actuator 24 in combination with the integral light transmitting areas 32, 33 is a preferred embodiment. Any suitable means could be used to connect the actuator 24 to the housing 14. However, the interlocking stationary connection of the first end 26 in the receiving area 36 without the use of additional fasteners is also a preferred embodiment. The switch 22 could also have any suitable switch button or lever to be actuated by the back of the second end 28 of the actuator 24.<br><br><br><br>
