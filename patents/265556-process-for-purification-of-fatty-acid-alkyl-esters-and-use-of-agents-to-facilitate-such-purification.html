				<td>PROCESS FOR PURIFICATION OF FATTY ACID ALKYL ESTERS AND<br>
USE OF AGENTS TO FACILITATE SUCH PURIFICATION<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of certain<br>
agents to facilitate the purification of an organic<br>
solution of fatty acid alkyl esters. The present<br>
invention also relates to a process for purification of<br>
the fatty acid alkyl esters suitable for use as<br>
biodiesel.<br>
Technical background<br>
Fatty acid alkyl esters (mono alkyl esters of fatty<br>
acids such as methyl and ethyl esters of fatty acids)<br>
derived from, vegetable oils or animal fats are known to<br>
be used as biodiesel- Known processes to produce such<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters comprise transesterification of<br>
triglycerides included in vegetable oils or animal fats<br>
in presence of an alcohol and a catalyst. It is well<br>
known in the art to use catalysts such as acid catalysts<br>
or more commonly alkali metal catalysts/ e g sodium and<br>
potassium hydroxide or a metal alkoxide such as sodium or<br>
potassium methoxide. In fact, a metal alkoxide is a<br>
compound formed by the reaction of an alcohol with an<br>
alkali metal. In summary, the transesterification<br>
reaction can generally be described as follow:<br><br>
Among vegetable oils or animal fats that can be used<br>
are coconut oil, palm oil, seed oil, olive oil, sunflower<br>
oil, Soya oil, rapeseed oil and tallow. Suitable alcohols<br>
that can be used are aryl alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol and butanol. Due to low cost, polarity<br><br>
and short chain, methanol is normally used in biodiesel<br>
production. Due to high activity, an alkali catalyst such<br>
as potassium hydroxide is usually used on industrial<br>
scale,<br>
A well-known process for producing fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters comprises heating, for example, a vegetable oil to<br>
a temperature of normally between 30*C and 110"C. The<br>
process further comprises adding an alcohol and a<br>
catalyst to the heated oil. The reaction will result in<br>
two phases, one including produced glycerol and the other<br>
including produced fatty acid alkyl ester. In addition,<br>
the process comprises removing the produced glycerol<br>
phase from the produced fatty acid alkyl ester phase.<br>
Fatty acid alkyl esters produced according to known<br>
processes as described above normally comprises to high<br>
levels of impurities to comply with regulatory norms<br>
concerning fatty acid alkyl esters, e g the European norm<br>
EN-14214 for fatty acids methyl esters, which especially<br>
limits the impurities originating from the metals K, Na,<br>
Mg and Ca. Accordingly, there is a need for purification<br>
of the produced fatty acid alkyl esters. Known processes<br>
for purification include steps of neutralization and<br>
washing with water, which will wash out the impurities<br>
and produce fatty acid alkyl ester that complies with the<br>
regulatory norms and thus can be used as biodiesel. After<br>
each step of washing, the water can be separated from the<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters by any method known in the art<br>
such as await for the mixture to settle into two phases<br>
and thereafter drain off the water phase, or by<br>
centrifugation of the mixture. The total amount of water<br>
used can typically range from 20 to 100% water of the<br>
produced volume of fatty acid alkyl esters: After<br>
purification is completed, the traces of water comprised<br>
in the fatty acid alkyl esters have to be removed, for<br>
example, by re-heating the fatty acid, alkyl esters. In<br>
addition, the water normally contains impurities that in<br>
turn needs to be removed, e g by filtrating the water<br><br>
and/or running the water through an ion exchange medium.<br>
The water can then be re-used or simply treated as<br>
wastewater.<br>
A drawback with known procedures for purification<br>
of fatty acid alkyl esters by using water is that it is<br>
difficult to reduce the amount of metal impurities, e g<br>
calcium and magnesium impurities, to levels that comply<br>
with the regulatory norms concerning fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters, even when large amount of water is used for<br>
purification. Another drawback with known procedures of<br>
purifying the fatty acid alkyl esters using water is that<br>
the manufacturing of biodiesel, for example, requires<br>
high energy input and becomes time-consuming and costly,<br>
since the process, for example, requires a large amount<br>
of water for purification, which in turn, needs to be<br>
purified.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In view of the aforementioned respects of known<br>
processes, an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a use of certain agents as well as a process for<br>
purification of fatty acid alkyl esters, which wholly or<br>
partly eliminate drawbacks of known techniques and which<br>
allow a production of fatty acid alkyl esters which is<br>
easy to handle resulting in high quality fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters suitable for use as biodiesel.<br>
The invention is defined by the independent claims.<br>
Embodiments are evident from the dependent claims and<br>
from the following description and examples<br>
According to a first aspect, there is provided a<br>
use of a flocculating and sequestering agent as an agent<br>
facilitating the purification of an organic solution<br>
comprising fatty acid alkyl esters.<br>
By a ^flocculating and sequestering agent" is meant<br>
a reagent, usually a polyelectrolyte, added to a<br>
suspension to unite fine particles to form flocks.<br>
Further, the term includes an agent that can form several<br><br>
bonds to a metal ion, such as calcium and magnesium. In<br>
addition, the term also relates to an agent that forms an<br>
aqueous phase within an organic solution, which phase<br>
also attracts ions.<br>
By an "organic solution of fatty acid alkyl esters"<br>
is understood a phase mainly comprising said fatty acid<br>
alkyl esters, but also small amounts of impurities such<br>
as the reactants and products of the transesterification<br>
process of triglycerides, e g soap, and ions and salts of<br>
metals.<br>
The use of a flocculating and sequestering agent<br>
facilitates the removal of impurities such as calcium,<br>
magnesium, potassium and sodium impurities. In addition,<br>
the treatment with this flocculating and sequestering<br>
agent will not affect the acid number of the product, e g<br>
measured as free fatty acids and as other acidity, when<br>
added and removed properly. The acid number of free fatty<br>
acid methyl esters, for example, according to EN 14214 is<br>
restricted to 0,5 mg KOH/kg oil (for further discussion<br>
see below).<br>
In one embodiment, the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent is selected from the group consisting<br>
of polyaluminium coagulants.<br>
Such polyaluminium coagulants facilitate to high<br>
extent a process, in which impurities, such as calcium,<br>
magnesium, potassium and sodium impurities, are to be<br>
removed, even from the nonpolar environment of the<br>
organic solution of fatty acid alkyl esters.<br>
In one embodiment, the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent is polyaluminium hydroxychloride.<br>
Polyaluminium hydroxychloride facilitate to high<br>
extent the removal of impurities in the nonpolar<br>
environment of the organic solution of fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters, attracting metal ions such as calcium and<br>
magnesium ions. In addition, the polyaluminium<br>
hydroxychloride also forms an aqueous phase within the<br>
organic solution, which phase also attracts ions such as<br><br>
sodium and potassium ions. Moreover, the chloride ions<br>
aid in the removal of ions such as potassium and sodium.<br>
In one embodiment, the organic solution is<br>
essentially anhydrous.<br>
The term "essentially anhydrous" should be<br>
understood in the context of that no effective amount of<br>
free water is present in the organic solution. An<br>
effective amount is the amount that is sufficient to<br>
achieve a noticeable reduction in impurities according to<br>
the known purification processes using water to wash out<br>
impurities without addition of the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent. Amounts of water known to be<br>
effective in such processes exceed 10% {by weight),<br>
typically around 10 to 60% (by weight) relative the<br>
organic solution. In its strict definition, the term<br>
means that no free water is needed for the purification<br>
and therefore not added to the organic solution during a<br>
purification process using the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent. This means that the only water<br>
present at any time during the purification process is<br>
the water remaining from previous treatment such as a<br>
transesterification process, and additions of compounds<br>
during the purification. The addition of a flocculating<br>
and sequestering agent adds to,the water content, and<br>
which addition depends on the added amount of agent. To<br>
some extent, small amounts of water, e g less than 1000<br>
ppm by weight, will aid the creation of a phase within<br>
the organic solution, which phase attracts ions such as<br>
sodium and potassium ions. But, using to high amounts of<br>
water together with the flocculating and sequestering<br>
agent might affect the purification of the organic<br>
solution in a negative way, i e the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent will not facilitate the removal of<br>
impurities.<br>
Notwithstanding, in a preferred embodiment the<br>
maximum water content of the organic solution can be up<br>
to 10% (w/w) . In a more preferred embodiment the maximum<br><br>
water content of the organic solution Can be up to 9.5,<br>
9.0, 8,5, 8.0, .7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0,<br>
3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.43 or 0.10 % (w/w).<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the water content is<br>
around 100 to 1000 ppm. (w/w), and even more preferred<br>
around 500 ppm. Each of these embodiments will allow<br>
small amounts water as long as the total water content is<br>
well below an effective amount of water as mentioned<br>
above, and that the purification is not affected in a<br>
negative way.<br>
According to a second aspect, there is provided a<br>
process for purification of an organic solution of fatty<br>
acid alkyl esters suitable for use as biodiesel,<br>
comprising:<br>
-	adding a flocculating and sequestering agent to<br>
the organic solution so as to facilitate the<br>
purification, and<br>
-	removing a portion from the organic solution,<br>
which portion comprises the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent, and impurities.<br>
Such a process for purification of fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters makes it possible to reduce the amount of metal<br>
impurities, e g calcium and magnesium impurities, to<br>
levels that comply with the regulatory norms concerning<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, the removing of<br>
the portion, from the organic solution comprises a step of<br>
centrifugation of the organic solution so as to remove<br>
the flocculating and sequestering agent together with<br>
impurities, which are solid, polar and/or have different<br>
densities than the fatty acid alkyl esters.<br>
Such a process will enable less energy input and<br>
becomes less time-consuming and less costly, as compared<br>
to the known processes using water to purify the organic<br>
solution. In addition, the efficiency of the process is<br>
easy to control and the process will demand very little<br>
monitoring. Moreover, the process can accomplish a system<br><br>
with low water content throughout the process. Such a<br>
process requires no water for purification, which in turn<br>
needs to be purified. In addition, the process yields a<br>
high amount of purified fatty acid alkyl esters that are<br>
suitable for use as biodiesel. Such a process will also<br>
enable the production of fatty acid alkyl esters without<br>
the need of separate neutralization with, for example, an<br>
acetic solution. Within the European norm (see above)<br>
there is a demand for the limitation of the acid number,<br>
which includes both free fatty and mineral acids in the<br>
biodiesel. The maximum value is 0.5 expressed as mg KOH/g<br>
of biodiesel. There is no demand for pH value in<br>
biodiesel, but the need for neutralization is assumed to<br>
create metal salts as a by-product of the neutralization.<br>
As an example, when fatty acid methyl esters are produced<br>
using methanol and alkali, the organic solution can<br>
contain rather high levels of alkali, which in turn leads<br>
to a pH up to around 11. In known processes, an acetic<br>
solution has to be added to the material.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, the<br>
centrifugation is performed under low pressure in order<br>
to remove water from the organic solution.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, essentially no<br>
water is added to the organic solution during the process<br>
to remove impurities.<br>
The term "essentially no added water" should be<br>
understood in the context of the term ^essentially<br>
anhydrous' as discussed above, i e the process comprises<br>
that the purification is performed in the absence of an<br>
effective amount of free water.<br>
According to one embodiment, the water content of<br>
the organic solution of fatty acid alkyl esters<br>
throughout the process can be up to 10% (w/w) . in a more<br>
preferred embodiment the maximum water content of the<br>
organic solution throughout the process can be up to 9.5,<br>
9.0, 8,5, 8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0r<br>
3.5, 3.0, 2.5/ 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5 0.43 or 0.10 % (w/w).<br><br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the water content is<br>
around 100 to 1000 ppm (w/w), and even more preferred<br>
around 500 ppm. Each of these embodiments will allow .<br>
small amounts water as long as the total water content is<br>
well below an effective amount of water as mentioned<br>
above, and that the purification is not affected in a<br>
negative way.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, the impurities<br>
comprise glycerol, soap, free fatty acid and/or metal<br>
impurities.<br>
The process for purification of fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters makes it possible to reduce the amount of such<br>
impurities.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, the metal<br>
impurities originate from metals comprising calcium,<br>
magnesium, potassium and/or sodium.<br>
The process for purification of fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters makes it especially possible to reduce the amount<br>
of such metal impurities, and even to reduce the amounts<br>
of the metal impurities in the final product to be used<br>
as biodiesel, so as to comply with regulatory norms.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, the flocculating<br>
and sequestering agent is selected from the group .<br>
consisting of polyaluminium coagulants.<br>
In one embodiment, the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent is polyaluminium hydroxychloride.<br>
The processes and the use according to the<br>
different aspects of the invention will now be described<br>
in more detail with reference to embodiments and<br>
examples.<br>
Detailed description of the invention and embodiments<br>
The invention relates to the use of a flocculating<br>
and sequestering agent as an agent facilitating the<br>
purification of an organic solution comprising fatty acid<br>
alkyl esters, in particular mono alkyl esters of long<br>
fatty acids that are suitable for use as biodiesel. In<br><br>
one aspect, the invention also relates to a process for<br>
purification of the organic solution of fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters. The process makes use of a flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent to facilitate the purification, and<br>
removing a portion from the organic solution, which<br>
portion comprises the flocculating and sequestering<br>
agent, and impurities.<br>
The organic solution of fatty acid alkyl esters to<br>
be purified is a product of vegetable oils or animal<br>
fats. In one embodiment, the oils or fats used are<br>
freshly refined oils or fats, meaning that the oils or<br>
fats have never been used. In another embodiment, the<br>
oils and fats used are re-used crude oils and fats such<br>
as oils that have been used as frying oils. Examples of<br>
vegetable oils freshly refined or re-used, are coconut<br>
oil, palm oil, olive oil, sunflower oil Soya oil and<br>
rapeseed oil.<br>
The organic solution for purification can be<br>
produced according processes known in the art. Examples<br>
of such processes are those that comprise either acid or<br>
base catalysts. Examples of such catalysts are the<br>
hydroxides from sodium and potassium., alkoxides of<br>
potassium and sodium as well as anhydrous sulphuric and<br>
acetic acids. In a process of fatty acid alkyl esters,<br>
such as methyl esters of fatty acids, it is desirable to<br>
accomplish a system with low water content throughout the<br>
process. Such a system will disable production of process<br>
water, increase the produced yield of fatty acid alkyl<br>
esters, and decrease the production of by-products such<br>
as soaps. The final product to be used as biodiesel<br>
should preferably contain less than 500 ppm water.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to use catalysts not<br>
producing, or producing very small amount of water during<br>
preparation or theirs addition. One example of a catalyst<br>
in this context is the methoxide of sodium or potassium,<br>
which in turn can be formed by the reaction of methanol<br>
with sodium or potassium. One example of a process for<br><br>
producing methyl esters of fatty acid comprises heating a<br>
vegetable oil to a temperature of normally between 30ºC<br>
and 110ºC, depending on the oil used, for example 80 to<br>
90°C when using used cooking oil, 50°C when using rape<br>
seed oil and slightly lower when using more unsaturated<br>
oils. The process further comprises adding methanol and<br>
potassium or sodium methoxide to the heated oil. The<br>
amounts of potassium or sodium methoxide and methanol<br>
added depend on, for example, the amount of free fatty<br>
acid present in the oil, and the average molecular weight<br>
of the oil, each of which can be decided as is known to<br>
those skilled in the art. The methanol is usually added<br>
in excess. The reaction will result in two phases, one<br>
including produced glycerol and the other including<br>
produced methyl esters of fatty acids. In addition, the<br>
process comprises removing the produced glycerol phase,<br>
typically constituting around 15 to 20 % (w/w) of the two<br>
phases, from the produced methyl ester phase, e g by<br>
gravity or two-phase centrifugation. Further, the<br>
methanol is removed by evaporation with help of under<br>
pressure or with a temperature above the boiling point of<br>
methanol. This process will yield an organic solution<br>
comprising up to 99 % (w/w) methyl esters of fatty acids,<br>
which organic solution needs to be purified according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Turning now to one aspect of the invention, wherein<br>
the flocculating and sequestering agent is used to aid<br>
the separation of impurities from the organic solution of<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters. The use of a flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent was surprisingly found to be useful in<br>
the almost xionpolar environments of the organic solution<br>
for attracting metal ions of various kinds. In addition,<br>
the flocculating and sequestering agent, was found to aid<br>
the separation of impurities other than metal ions from<br>
the organic solution, such as free fatty acids, soap and<br>
glycerol, which are polar as compared to the organic<br>
solution. Examples of such flocculating and sequestering<br><br>
agents are polyaluminium coagulants. Polyaluminium<br>
coagulants have a polymeric structure, and are known to<br>
be soluble in water. The length of the polymerised chain,<br>
molecular weight and number of ionic charges is<br>
determined by the degree of polymerisation. On<br>
hydrolysis, various mono- and polymeric species are<br>
formed. These highly polymerised sequestering agents<br>
include, for example: polyaluminium chloride, aluminium<br>
hydroxychloride, and polyaluminium hydroxychloride;<br>
marketed as, for example, Ekoflock 54, and Sweflock 10.<br>
The advantages of vising polyaluminium coagulants are, for<br>
example, that they are cheap, non-carcinogenic and that<br>
they also will attract the ions from sodium and potassium<br>
in a chloride solution. Examples of other conceivable<br>
types of sequestering agents available on the market are<br>
polyaluminium ferric chloride, EDTA and acryl amides.<br>
The flocculating and sequestering agent together<br>
with the impurities can be separated and removed from the<br>
organic solution by methods such as centrifugation and<br>
filtration or just by gravity letting the mixture settle<br>
into two phases, or by any other mechanical means as is<br>
known to those skilled in the art. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the impurities are separated and removed by<br>
at least one step of centrifugation.<br>
In one embodiment, polyaluminium hydroxychloride is<br>
used as the flocculating and sequestering agent, which is<br>
known as a satisfactory sequestering agent in water for<br>
metal ions, such as calcium and magnesium. The<br>
sequestering agent polyalurainium hydroxychloride was<br>
found to be useful in the nonpolar environment of the<br>
organic solution of fatty acid alkyl esters, attracting<br>
metal ions such as calcium and magnesium ions. In<br>
addition, the polyaluminium hydroxychloride also forms an<br>
aqueous phase within the organic solution, which phase<br>
also attracts ions such as sodium and potassium ions.<br>
Accordingly, even if less than 100% of the ions such as<br>
calcium and magnesium ions are sequestered by the<br><br>
flocculating and sequestering agent, a sufficient level<br>
of the remaining ions will be able to enter the aqueous<br>
phase. It should be noted that the traces of "water<br>
content" increases in the organic solution after addition<br>
of polyaluminiura hydroxychloride that by its addition<br>
releases up to 1000 ppm (w/w) of water to the organic<br>
solution, depending on the amount of polyaluminium<br>
hydroxychloride added.<br>
In one embodiment, the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent is added when the pH in the organic<br>
solution is 9 to 12. Preferably, the pH is 10-11.<br>
Accordingly, the flocculating and sequestering agent is<br>
preferably added short after the transesterification<br>
process is completed and the methanol and glycerol has<br>
been removed, since the pH is high, around 10.3 to 10.5,<br>
and which pH will decrease in time.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the organic solution is<br>
essentially anhydrous, when the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent is added, meaning that no effective<br>
amount of free water is present in the organic solution.<br>
An effective amount is the amount that is sufficient to<br>
achieve a noticeable reduction in impurities according to<br>
the known purification processes using water to wash out<br>
impurities without addition of the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent. Amounts of water known to be<br>
effective in such processes exceed 10% (by weight),<br>
typically around 10 to 60% (by weight) relative the<br>
organic solution. In its strict definition, the term<br>
means that no free water is needed for the purification<br>
and therefore not added to the organic solution during a -<br>
purification process using the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent. This means that the only water<br>
present at any time during such purification process is<br>
the water remaining from previous treatment such as a<br>
transesterification process, and additions of compounds<br>
during the purification. The addition of a flocculating<br>
and sequestering agent adds to the water content, and<br><br>
which addition depends on the,added amount of agent. To<br>
some extent, small amounts of water, e g less than 1000<br>
ppm by weight, will aid the creation of a phase within<br>
the organic solution, which phase attracts ions such as<br>
sodium and potassium ions. But, using to high amounts of<br>
water together with the flocculating and sequestering<br>
agent might affect the purification of the organic<br>
solution in a negative way, i e the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent will not facilitate the removal of<br>
impurities as will be exemplified by the comparative<br>
examples 7 to 10.<br>
Notwithstanding, in one embodiment the maximum<br>
water content of the organic solution can be up to 10%<br>
(w/w) . In a more preferred embodiment the maximum water<br>
content of the organic solution can be up to 9.5, 9.0,<br>
8,5, 8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5,<br>
3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.43 or 0.10 % (w/w). In a<br>
more preferred embodiment, the water content is around<br>
100 to 1000 ppm (w/w), and even more preferred around 500<br>
ppm. Each of these embodiments will allow small amounts<br>
water as long as the total water content is well below an<br>
effective amount of water as mentioned above, and that<br>
the purification is not affected in a negative way. The<br>
concentration of water of the final product to be used as<br>
biodiesel should comply with the regulatory norms, and be<br>
equal or less than 500 ppm (w/w).<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the<br>
process for purification of the organic solution of fatty<br>
acid alkyl esters is provided. The process comprises a<br>
step of adding a flocculating and sequestering agent to<br>
the organic solution so as to facilitate the<br>
purification. In addition, the process comprises a step<br>
of removing a portion from the organic solution, which<br>
portion comprises the flocculating and sequestering<br>
agent, and impurities.<br>
In one embodiment of the process, the step of<br>
removing a portion from the organic solution comprises a<br><br>
step of centrafugation so as to reduce the amount of<br>
impurities and flocculating and sequestering agent in the<br>
organic solution. One example of a centrifuges is a<br>
centrifuge with a closed bowl, e g model FM600 of Mann-<br>
Hummel, which is driven by and working under continuous<br>
flow of medium to be separated- The inlet of the<br>
centrifuge can be connected to a mixing tank/vessel and a<br>
pump, and the outlet for the purified solution can in<br>
turn also be connected to said tank/vessel.<br>
It is noted that any suitable centrifuge as is<br>
known to those skilled in the art can be used. During the<br>
centrifugation, compounds that are solids, polar or/and<br>
have different densities than the fatty acid alkyl esters<br>
are separated and removed from the organic solution, such<br>
as the flocculating and sequestering agent and<br>
impurities. The total amount of impurities can constitute<br>
around 1 to 5 % (w/w) of the organic solution. Examples<br>
of such compounds are impurities such as salts and ions<br>
of metals, free fatty acids, glycerol and soap. In one<br>
embodiment, using a bowl centrifuge (e g model FM600 of<br>
Mann-Hummel), a portion comprising free fatty acids,<br>
glycerol and soap together with the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent create a phase in the bowl, which<br>
phase is polar as compared to the organic solution of<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters and which is drained off after<br>
centrifugation. Metal ions are also localized in this<br>
portion and thereby removed simultaneously. In one<br>
working embodiment, the centrifugation. is performed using<br>
the bowl centrifuge of model EM600 (Mann-Hummel) at<br>
around 4200 rpm for six hours under continuous<br>
recirculation flow. In one embodiment, the centrifugation<br>
is performed under low pressure, e g -0.9 bar. The low<br>
pressure was shown to provide, for example, a reduction<br>
of water content, wherein the final water content in the<br>
organic solution is less than 500 ppia. The amount of<br>
impurities can, for example, be lowered from around 5% to<br>
1% (w/w) of the organic solution. Typically, the portion<br><br>
drained off from the centrifuge constitutes approximately<br>
1.1 % (w/w) as compared to the initial batch weight.<br>
Using a flocculating and sequestering agent such as<br>
polyaluminium hydroxychloride in combination with<br>
separation by centrifugation lower to high extent the .<br>
amount of impurities in the organic solution. The amount<br>
of added flocculating and sequestering agent depends on<br>
the initial levels of impurities. Saturated levels can be<br>
added, and even in excess., as calculated from the initial<br>
amount of impurities, which calculation is evident for<br>
those skilled in the art. Typical amount is above 0.5 %<br>
(w/w)., in particular 0.5 to 2.5 % (w/w), of the organic<br>
solution to be purified.<br>
The purified organic solution should comply with<br>
regulatory norms, e g the European norm EN-14214. In this<br>
norm the following limitations are stated: 5 mg/kg for<br>
potassium plus sodium and 5 mg/kg for calcium and<br>
magnesium. Examples of values before purification and<br>
after purification using a process comprising both<br>
centrifugation and addition of polyaluminium<br>
hydroxychloride are, as shown in the experimental part,<br>
for calcium plus magnesium 11 to 14 and 0.3 to 2.2,<br>
respectively, and for potassium and sodium 440 to 100 and<br>
3.9 to 4.1, respectively.<br>
As discussed above, one embodiment of the process<br>
comprises that essentially no water is added during the<br>
process. As will be evident from the experimental part,<br>
water can even affect the purification in a negative way.<br>
In one embodiment, the addition of the flocculating<br>
and sequestering agent to the organic occurs before any<br>
centrifugation is performed. The addition is followed by<br>
at least one centrifugation step to remove the impurities<br>
together with the flocculating and sequestering agent.<br>
This method demands no or very little supervision by the<br>
operator, wherein the purification can be performed with<br>
just one step of removing impurities.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the organic solution is<br>
subjected to at least one centrifugation step before any<br>
addition of the flocculating and sequestering agent<br>
occurs and further steps of removing impurities. The<br>
advantage with this method is to enable a pre-removal<br>
impurities, in particular soap and glycerol in almost<br>
pure form, before adding the flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent, and thereafter steps of<br>
centrifugation.<br>
According to an additional aspect of the invention,<br>
there is provided a process for producing an organic<br>
solution comprising fatty acid alkyl esters, in<br>
particular mono alkyl esters of long fatty acids that are<br>
suitable for use as biodiesel. The process comprises<br>
producing the organic solution to be purified as<br>
discussed above, and purifying this organic solution<br>
according to the aspects of the invention regarding<br>
purification.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be illustrated further<br>
through the non-limiting recital of experiments conducted<br>
in accordance therewith. In these experiments the aspects<br>
of purification with or without adding a flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent were tested as well as different<br>
concentrations of the same.<br>
Examples 1 to 6<br>
Experimental procedures<br>
Each one of the experiment of examples 1 to 6 was<br>
based on a batch of organic solution of fatty acid methyl<br>
esters produced using one embodiment of above described<br>
process for transesterification, wherein sodium or<br>
potassium methoxide was used as the catalyst as well as<br>
methanol as the alcohol, The catalyst added was for<br>
potassium methylate 0.64% by weight of organic solution,<br><br>
and for sodium methylate 0.45% by weight. Methanol was<br>
added at a stoichiometric surplus of 50 % by weight.<br>
After the transesterification was completed, the glycerol<br>
phase was drained off and the excess of methanol was<br>
removed under low pressure (-0.9 bar) to leave a<br>
remaining batch of the organic solution for purification.<br>
The batch size for each experiment was around 3000 kg.<br>
Experimental conditions for purification<br>
For all experiments, the centrifugation was<br>
performed using a bowl centrifuge (model FM600 of Mann-<br>
Hummel) at 4,200 rpm for six hours at 55°C under low<br>
pressure (-0.9 bar).<br>
Polyaluminiuin hydroxy chloride (cat no 1327-41-9,<br>
Eka Nobel) was used as the flocculating sequestering and<br>
agent. The amount added was from 0 to 2,25 % by weight<br>
organic solution.<br>
Polyaluminium hydroxychloride was added following<br>
the transesterification process and after the glycerol<br>
and the excess of methanol has been removed, when pH<br>
still is high, which pH was determined to be around 10.3<br>
to 10.5.<br>
Metal content analysis<br>
The metal levels for Mg, Ca, Na and K were<br>
determined with ICP analysis (inductive coupled plasma<br>
with argon) using an instrument from Spectro GmbH. The<br>
analyses were performed based on the standard methods<br>
described by: ASTM D 4951-96, ASTM 5708~95a, ASTM 5185-<br>
95, DIN 51390-4, DIN 51391-3 and DIN 51790-6, whereby the<br>
spectrum lines 183,801/393,366, 285,213, 589,592 and<br>
766.490 nm were ,used to determine the metal content<br>
concentrations for Ca, Mg, Na and K, respectively, which<br>
determination of concentrations is evident for the person<br>
skilled in the,art.<br><br>
Water content analysis<br>
The water content was analyzed volumetrically by<br>
using calcium hydride (CaH2) . The hydride reacts with the<br>
water forming a gas pressure, which was measured by a<br>
special gauge for this purpose (the gauge meter in the so<br>
called Mobil water test kit, no 429950 produced by<br>
Signum/ExxonMobil).<br><br>
From the data shown in table 1, it is evident that<br>
the metals calcium plus magnesium and potassium plus<br>
sodium can amount around 20 and 100 - 450 mg/ kg,<br>
respectively, after production of the organic solution<br>
comprising fatty acid alkyl esters before any<br>
purification. After treating the material with<br>
polyaluminium hydroxychloride followed by centrifugation<br>
the metal levels were to high extent reduced.<br>
In example 3, the results were obtained by a step<br>
of centrifugation, but without addition of any<br>
flocculating and sequestering agent. The results show<br><br>
that the metal levels are reduced to some extent, but not<br>
to the levels obtained by using the purification<br>
combination of centrifugation and addition of a<br>
flocculating and sequestering agent.<br>
For example 5, it should be noted that the results<br>
were obtained by using a slightly malfunctioning<br>
centrifuge.<br>
Results: Example 6<br>
In one experiment the water content of the organic<br>
solution was analyzed. The -water content was as highest<br>
right before centrifugation and was determined to be<br>
0.43% (w/w) . After centrifugation for two hour, the water<br>
content was 0.23% (w/w) and after the centrifugation was<br>
completed the water content was determined to be 0.12%<br>
(w/w) . The reason for the relatively high amount of water<br>
after the completed centrifugation was shown to be a<br>
result of a malfunctioning centrifuge. In other<br>
experiments the final water content have been determined<br>
to be lower than 1000 ppm (w/w), and the final product to<br>
be less than 500 ppm (data not shown).<br>
Comparative Examples 7 to 10<br>
Experimental procedures<br>
Each one of the experiments of examples 7 to 10 was<br>
based on a batch of organic solution of fatty acid methyl<br>
esters produced as mentioned above in examples 1 to 6.<br>
For each experiment, rape seed oil was used as the.<br>
starting material. The amount of biodiesel used for<br>
purification in each experiment was 100 g per experiment.<br>
The purification of the produced organic solution was<br>
performed in a similar way as described in examples 1 to<br>
6, with the exception that the step of removal of the<br>
portion comprising the impurities was not performed by<br>
centrifugation. Instead, the organic solution was washed<br>
with water. The washing comprised mixing water with the<br><br>
organic solution, and removing the water from the organic<br>
solution. Three steps of washing were performed, wherein<br>
20% (w/w) of water was added and removed in each step.<br>
This process resembles methods in the art in which water<br>
is used to wash the organic solution. One difference<br>
compared to the known methods was that a flocculating and<br>
sequestering agent was mixed into the organic solution<br>
before any washing with water occurred. The step of<br>
mixing flocculating and sequestering agent was performed<br>
before the steps of washing. After the washing with<br>
water, the remaining traces of water were removed by<br>
leaving the organic solution in a water bath at 50°C<br>
until the water content was below 500 ppm.<br><br>
From the data shown in table 2, it "is evident that<br>
washing water (3 x 20% w/w) without centrifugation<br><br>
together with the flocculating and sequestering agent<br>
will not work properly in reducing the metal impurities,<br>
even as compared to washing with water without any<br>
addition of flocculating and sequestering agent. Only the<br>
values for calcium plus magnesium are of approved levels.<br>
The reason for the relatively high remaning levels of<br>
metal impurities might be due to poor water solubility<br>
properties of the complexes formed by the flocculating<br>
and sequestering agent. Moreover, as seen from the low<br>
remaining chloride concentration of the final product,<br>
the mechanism of using washing water might not allow the<br>
potassium plus sodium to form chlorides together with the<br>
flocculating and sequestering agent. Instead, the<br>
chloride ions seem to preferably migrate into the water<br>
and thereby being washed away without the metals and the<br>
flocculating and sequestering agent. The concentration of<br>
chloride ions before purification and after the<br>
flocculating and sequestering agent has been added can be<br>
up 11 rug/kg.<br>
These results also indicate that addition of water<br>
with the flocculating and sequestering agent might affect<br>
the purification of the organic solution in a negative<br>
way, i e the flocculating and sequestering agent will not<br>
facilitate the removal of impurities, even when<br>
purification process comprises a centrifugation step.<br>
Examples 11 and 12<br>
Experimental procedures<br>
Each one of the experiment of examples 11 and 12<br>
was based on a batch of organic solution of fatty acid<br>
methyl esters produced, purified and analyzed as<br>
mentioned above in examples 1 to 6, with the exceptions<br>
of a slightly different amount of added catalyst and th&amp;t<br>
batch size was around 3000 kg in example 11 and around<br>
16000 kg in example 12. In example ll, the catalyst was<br>
potassium methylate in an amount of around 0.78%<br><br>
by weight of organic solution. In example 12, the<br>
catalyst was sodium methylate in an amount of around<br>
0.51% by weight of organic solution.<br>
Results: Examples 11 and 12<br><br>
From the data shown in table 3, it is evident that<br>
by treating the organic solution of fatty acid methyl<br>
esters with polyaluminium hydroxychloride followed by<br>
centrifugation the metal levels were to high extent<br>
reduced, even in case of sunflower oil as the origin of<br>
organic solution.<br><br>
