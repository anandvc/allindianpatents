The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
GARNTED<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for regulated release of fluids/water/dissolving liquids under gravity flow. Such a device is adapted for operative connection to active biocide release systems such as halogenated resins and/or chlorine tablets for regulated contact of said fluid/water dissolving liquid with actives usually used for purification/sanitization and like purposes. In particular, the invention is directed to a system for regulated release of fluid/water by way of an unique flow throttling of the fluid/water resulting from gravity flow in or to such purification means/units thereby ensuring desired regulated flow of the fluid/water/dissolving liquid ensuring uniform contact of the flowing fluids/water with the active biocides to avoid problems of under or over treatment of the fluid/water with said actives. The device of the invention is applicable especially in purification devices where the flow of liquid is driven by gravity which result in variations of liquid flow rate with the available head in the overhead storage bucket or top chamber containing the input liquid. The device is especially adapted for domestic applications such as portable water supplies, waste water systems, run of waters, filtration units and the like involving gravity feed flow of<br>
fluids/liquids/water.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that purification means/units of the types discussed above usually require the fluids/water to be treated or used as a treatment media to traverse under gravity flow through various filtration / purification /sanitizing means/units to thereby<br><br>
effect contact with<br><br>
h the active for such treatment or release of the active into the<br><br>
liquid/water to effect the treatment of the water/fluid or serve as a treatment media.<br><br>
US 458 4106 disc<br><br>
oses a chlorination system for distributing chlorine as the active in a<br><br>
hot tub or spa. The system regulates the flow of water through a mixing chamber with a valve or stopcock to control the rate of chlorine distribution. An assembly of venturies and baffles also regulates the flow of water through the mixing chamber and controls the size of particles of chlorination tables that will flow out of the chlorination system.<br>
US 5089127 discloses a chemical feeder including a cylinder for receiving a canister<br>
which holds a plurality of shaped solid sanitizing elements in the form of pellets or the<br><br>
tablets or the like, and the lower end<br>
he bottom and the lower end of the canister sidewall are perforated Dortion of the canister is located within the upper portion of an open top inlet or erosion reservoir. Water enters the lower end of the erosion reservoir through an inlet opening in the form of a jet and passes upwardly to contact the solid<br>
sanitizing elements<br>
supplied to the water passing through the feeder is controlled by varying the inlet flow rate of the water which impinges upon the elements in the lower end portion of the canister. In this system an inlet control valve is mounted in the inlet conduit to control the flow of the inlet water into the sanitizing element reservoir.<br>
in the lower end portion of the canister to gradually erode and dissolve the solid sanitizing elements in the lower end portion of the canister. The amount of chemica<br><br>
US 6298871 B1 discloses yet another chemical feeder that produces a solution of a chemical treating agent for example sodium hypochlorite comprising a housing defining a cavity, and elongated substantial vertical hollow container is centrally located within the cavity. The bottom wall of the side wall of the container is adjacent to the base and contains a plurality of perforations in the lower portion of the side wall which is spaced<br>
from the inside wall of the housing. At least one hollow canister having a plurality of perforations in its base and the lower portion of its sidewall is interposed for example slidably receive within the container. Conduits for delivering the liquid in which the chemical treating agent is provided to a chamber below the perforations in the canister<br><br>
and for removing<br><br>
the liquid stream containing the chemical treating agent from the<br><br>
feeder are also provided<br>
It would be apparent from the above that while several sanitizing/ chlorination systems are well known and available to the art and also there exists several systems which involve the purification / chlorination / disinfecting by contact of the active with fluid/water to be treated, as regards the control over the rate of the water flow into the active dissolving zone of such systems it is mostly attended; to; by mariually operable gadgets such as control valves or pumps, with or without orifice plates and venturies. Moreover, usually such systems of flow control of fluids/water for chlorination/purification necessarily involves the use of either electrically, electronically, pneumatically or hydraulically actuated control valves or flow stop cocks, globe valves, taps or any such flow restricting devices which require manual intervention.<br><br>
require that their Hence such flow<br>
As regards the other simple liquid flow control by orifices, baffles and venturies these unless accompanied with other flow control gadgets can produce drastic changes in the flow characteristics and turbulence by placing a point obstruction in the flow path thereby distorting the flow pattern significantly and producing insufficient flow regulation. This could lead to non uniform flow/contact of the water/fluid with the actives and consequential problems of sanitation. Moreover, these devices are short in length, with the length (dimension parallel to the flow direction) being a few mm which necessarily<br>
diameter be much smaller to achieve the desired flow reduction.<br>
regulators present a significant risk of clogging if either particles or dissolved salts are present in the liquid which physically block the orifice due to precipitation, thereby clogging or blocking the liquid flow channel.<br>
Considering that the fluids / water/dissolving liquids passing through such purification /<br><br>
/filtration systems<br><br>
is either itself treated and/or on its own constitutes a treating media<br><br>
having dissolved actives, in either case it is important that the fluids/water whether it is a<br><br>
treated media or t<br><br>
the treatment media need to encounter its contact with the selective<br><br>
active biocide in a controlled manner whereby only a definite, amount of water/fluid is<br><br>
exposed to the active biocide contact for predetermining time span so as to regulate the contact and/or dissolution of the active in the fluid/water stream and ensure effective and uniform treatment of the water or concentration of actives in the water as a treating media.<br><br>
Thus while need<br><br>
exist for a more definite and precise control over the flow rate to<br><br>
achieve uniform contact of the fluids/water with the active biocide, the flow control<br><br>
means presently manually adapted stopcocks, and v<br>
available and in use especially for gravity flow systems are either for large scale industrial applications involving the use of pumps,<br>
ave or are such that they do not effectively achieve the desired control as discussed above. There is thus no simple and cost effective solution to the required flow control of water / fluids/dissolving liquids under gravity flow.<br><br>
Moreover, in case important that the 1 be incorporated or and on the other favourable end use in shape and size<br><br>
of gravity fed systems especially for domestic applications it is ow control system should be such that on one hand it is adapted to attached to the existing fluids/water flow systems / purification units, land it should be of small dimension to favour its portability and The simplicity and portability requirements again call for limitations of the flow control device for such application which made it more<br><br>
challenging to provide such a device meeting the above requisites.<br><br>

water/fluid entry from a source/supply and an outlet ehd for  the regulated/controlled outflow of the fluid/water, said inlet end and the outlet end of the fluid/water path operatively connected to define at least one fluid/water flow path, said fluid/water flow path comprising a combination of straight path and at least one bend adapted for controlling the flow rate of water flowing there through under gravity.<br><br>
Thus according to a preferred aspect of the present invention there is provided a device for controlled release of fluid/water under gravity flow comprising an inlet end for the water/fluid entry from a source/supply and an outlet end for the regulated/controlled outflow of the fluid/water, said inlet end and the outlet end of the fluid/water path operatively connected to define at least one fluid/water flow path, said fluid/water flow path comprising a combination of straight path whose length is at least 10 times its smallest side or diameter and at least one bend adapted for controlling the flow rate of<br><br>
water flowing there<br><br>
through under gravity.<br><br><br><br>
In accordance wi fluids/water under<br><br>
h a more preferred aspect the device of controlled  release of gravity flow comprises of said inlet end of the said fluid/water and<br><br>
said outlet for the regulated outflow of the fluid/water, said inlet end and the outlet end<br><br><br>
of the water / fluid tubular fluid/water f bends and having a<br>
operatively connected to define a tubular fluid/water flow path, said ow path comprising a combination of plurality of gradual or angular side/diameter in the range of 0.5 mm to 20mm.<br><br>
Preferably, the said tubular water/fluid flow path is provided in an enclosed block adapted for simple and convenient handling / assembling of the flow control device in relation to any conventional water supply source including chiorination/sanitation systems. For the purpose, the inlet end of the device is adapted for operative connection to any conventional water source/supply tank while the outlet if required to supply to any purification means/unit is adapted for operative connection to any conventional purification means/unit including disaffection/sanitizing systems.<br><br>
While the dimensions and configuration of the tubular flow path can be varied to provide<br><br>
the desired leve which includes a<br><br>
of control, it is preferred to achieve the above with a configuration lumber of sharp angular bends arranged in a horizontal plane or over<br><br>
multiple horizontal planes.   The number of the bends in the water/fluid path would<br><br>
depend upon the<br><br>
desired control of the flow rate of the water/fluid passing through the<br><br>
device, usually the number of angular bends for controlling the water flow rate can<br><br>
 range from 1 to 1<br>
00 and preferably in the range of 4-64 and most preferably in the range of 8-32. The number of horizontal planes can be preferably in the range of 1 to 50, but most preferably in a range of 1 to 6.<br><br>

It is preferred that to achieve a maximum pressure drop across minimum of length it is desirable to have that the angles are formed of 90 degrees/<br><br><br>
The uniqueness of<br>
the device of the invention includes the advantageous compression of a large path length of 1cm to 10 m within a small available space by way of a selective configuration of a tubular flow path for the water to traverse for the desired flow regulation.<br><br>
Importantly, the flow control arrangement in the device of the invention achieves the<br>
 required flow control in a very small and compact enclosure thereby providing for its<br>
adaptability for use in any online or gravity flow path for fluids/water such as taps or with<br><br>
any conventional water.<br><br>
purification means/units which require such controlled flow rate of the<br><br>
The aforesaid flow regulating arrangement in the device provides a simple and selective solution to achieve the required flow control of fluid/water in gravity flow situations without involving complexities of conventional flow regulating means such as, solenoid or butterfly valves, stopcocks or encountering problems in simple flow control mechanisms such as orifices, baffles and venturies.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an improved purification/sanitizing system comprising :<br>
a device for comtrolled release of fluid/water under gravity flow comprising an inlet end for said fluid/water from any source or supply of water and an outlet end for regulated supply of said fluid/water, said inlet end and the outlet end of the water/fuid operatively connected to define at least<br>
 one water flow path,, said water flow path comprising a combination of straight path and at least one bend adapted for controlling the flow rate of water flowing therethrough under gravity;the controlled and regulated flow of water exiting the said outlet of said device being supplied to at least one purification units/means for regulated contact of a steady predetermined<br><br>
flow rate of the fluid/water with the active biocide material with said purification means/units.<br>
The configuration of the flow path can be such that it is devoid of sharp angular bends in either the horizontal or the vertical plane and is simply a length of tube whose length is at least 10 times its diameter. It is further preferred that the length of the tubular flow path is at least 50 times its diameter and most preferably more than 100 times its diameter. The long tubular flow path should be preferably coiled, to achieve the desired level of compactness resulting in a single or multiple loops, which can be arranged either in the vertical or horizontal plane. The diameter of the tubular flow path is chosen in a manner so as to minimise the risk of clogging, due to precipitation of particles, over the designed life o the device.<br>
The  above  system  of  the  invention  enables  effective  sanitization/disinfecting  of water/fluids by chemical actives/biocides in selective amounts.<br>
The active can be any suitable purification/sanitizing agent in powdered, granular, resin or tablet form. The sanitizing agent can preferably be pentaiodide resin, trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA). It is also possible to use other conventional chlorine releasing compounds such as potassium dischlorisocyanurate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, chlorinated trisodium phosphate, calcium hypochlorite, lithium hypochlorite, monochloramine, dichloramine, [(monotrichloro)-tetra(monopotassium dichloro)]     pentaisocyanurate,     1,3     dichloro-5,5-dimethylidanotone,     paratoluene<br><br>
sulfodichloroamide thrichloromelamine, N-chloramine, N-chlorosuccinimide, N,N'-dichloroazodicarbonamide, N-chloroacetyl-urea, N,N-dichloroazodicarbonamide, N-chloroacetyl-urea,N.N-dichlorbiurile, chlorinated dicyandiamide.   <br>
DESCRIPTION IN RELATION TO THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the device of the invention under gravity feed situation as per the accompanying figures wherein-<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of the flow regulating system illustrating use of multiple angular bends in a horizontal plane.<br>
Figure 1a shows top view and Figure 1b shows the side view.<br><br>
Figure 2 . is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of the flow regulating system illustrating use of multiple angular bends in multiple horizontal planes. Figure 2a shows top view and Figure 2b shows the side view.<br>
Figure 1a shows the top view of flow regulating system illustrating use of multiple<br>
angular bends in a horizontal plane. The water from the inlet (IN) flows through the<br>
tubular path (TP) having angular bends (AB) and flows into  the receiver (R) that<br>
connects it to the chemical sanitizing unit holding a suitable biocide.<br><br>
Figure 1b shows the side view of flow regulating system illustrating use of multiple angular bends in a horizontal plane. It shows additional feature of how the water after having passed through the chemical sanitizing unit flows out through the outlet (OT) which is further connected to an activated carbon scavenger.<br><br>

especially in simp<br>
It would be apparent from the above that the device of the invention serves the much required control over the rate of water flow through the active biocide release system e chlorinating devices such as those based on gravity flow without complex mechanisms such as pumps and valves to thereby ensure effective and controlled chlorination of the water. This is extremely important since under the gravity<br><br>
 flow systems if the<br><br>
flow rate is not controlled there can be non-uniform release of the<br><br><br>
active biocide in the flowing water.   For example, if the source is a 190-200 mm tall<br><br>
bucket which delivers a flow rate as high as 1000 ml/minute, when water is at full head and can deliver a flow rate of 50 ml / minute towards the end of the cycle when the head of the water in the bucket is low. Such variation in the flow rate has a significant impact on the controlled re ease of active biocide from the active biocide media, as the active release is a function of a contact time of the media with wafer For instance, the active release when flow rate is very low would be as high as 20 units and could fall to 1-2 units when flow rate is 1000 ml/minute under same set of conditions. This then results<br>
in either under treatment or over treatment which is not desired as both would have<br><br><br>
harmful effects contrary to the purpose of the purification/treatments. By incorporating<br><br>
the device for con the active biocide<br>
rolled release of water/fluid of the invention in the water flow path to release system as discussed above under the present invention it is now possible to control flow of water coming in contact with the active biocide media within a narrow band regardless of the input water flow rate into the device.   This<br>
enables control of active release using the flow regulating device of the invention within<br>
a range of +/- 5 units.<br><br><br>
purification/sanitation and the like. The advantages achieved and the various preferred<br><br>
The system of the  to take care of<br><br><br>
invention in particular the controlled release system is thus directed problems of insufficient or over treatment of fluid/water during<br><br><br><br>
embodiments of the hereunder.<br><br>
controlled release sanitizing systems of the invention are discussed<br><br>
In particular, the angular bends enable better control of water flow rate under a compact small region and yet provide dimensions of the tubular flow path such that problems of clogging experienced in small dimension passages such as orifice, venturies could be avoided.<br>
Examples:<br>
Effect of the flow regulating system of the invention on flow rate:<br>
A graduated water tank of 4 L capacity fitted with a pre-filter attached to an outlet at the<br><br>
bottom,  without the<br><br>
flow regulating device was used for comparison (Example 1). The<br><br><br><br>
tank and pre-filten<br><br>
assembly was fitted with a flow regulating device according to<br><br>
invention in one horizontal plane as shown in fig 1 (Example 2). In Example 3 there was no pre-filter or flow throttling device, and in Example 4, there was no pre-filter but a flow throttling device having the angular bends in multiple horizontal planes as shown in fig 2 was fitted. In Example 5 a pre-filter with high resistance but without the flow throttling device was used to throttle flow.<br>
The details of the length, the number of right angular bends, and the diameter of the flow path etc and the effect on flow throttling data are presented in Table 1 and 2. The initial water head in the tank was maintained 20 cm for all the experiments.<br>
The water was allowed to flow out of the tank and the water flow rate was measured at intervals of a minute from 1min, 5 and 20 min.<br>
16<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 show that flow throttling device according to the<br><br>
invention is capab<br><br>
e of reducing the variability in the flow rate although the initial water<br><br>
head was the same. This will also help in ensuring constant concentration of the biocide pick up over a water purification cycle. The high resistance pre-filter brings down the flow drastically which is not preferred as an alternative to the flow regulating device. Pre filters clog with usage bringing down the flow rate further while the device of the invention does not show significant reduction of flow rate with usage. Other conventional flow regulating devices such as orifice plates would also incur the problem of clogging with usage.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to achieve a simple to fabricate device<br><br>
for flow regulation water flow throttling<br>
of fluid/water/dissolving liquids under gravity by way of an unique device which is compact, portable and easily adaptable for use with<br>
any gravity flow fluid/water supply/source without encountering problems of, turbulence and/or clogging and related system failure. The device is compact and can be available in the form of a cartridge for ready and diverse applications for such flow control. The device is further adapted for use in or with any conventional water source /pipeline, tap or purifying/sanitizing/disinfecting/filtration system requiring regulated supply of water/fluids there through and should have wide utility especially for domestic and simple applications for like purposes.<br><br><br><br>
