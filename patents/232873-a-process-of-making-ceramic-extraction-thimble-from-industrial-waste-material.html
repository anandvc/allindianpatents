				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method of making ceramic extraction thimble from industrial waste materials. The process of the present invention particularly relates to the use of industrial waste like waste from paper industries for making extraction thimble with vast applicability. The extraction thimble is used for sampling of flue gas Suspended Particulate Matters from the stack of a furnace.<br>
At present for stack monitoring Glass fibre filter and cellulose filters are available in the market. Conventional thimbles are manufactured from high-alpha cellulose cotton linters where only virgin material is used of assured purity. References for which may be made to the product guide of Whatman, 1996. It may also be made by using synthetic polymers references for which may be made to " Handbook of particle sampling and analysis"' by Charles H. Murphy, Verlag Chemie International Inc., Florida, 1984. No manufacturing process was divulged by way of paper publication or by patents. The disadvantages of the above materials are:<br>
1.	Cellulose filter can not withstand temperature above 150°C.<br>
2.	Glass Fibre filters can not withstand temperature above 600°C.<br>
The stack gas temperature is generally more than 600°C and in those cases sampling of stack becomes impossible. But according to the Central<br><br>
1.	Grinding of waste paper pulp, charcoal, china clay and alumina to -<br>
300 mesh size.<br>
2.	Ground waste paper pulp is mixed with clay and water.<br><br>
4.	The mixture is ball milled for four hours.<br>
5.	The mixture is taken out and a slip is made with it.<br>
6.	The slip is casted in moulds to shape.<br>
7.	The shaped material is taken out and dried in oven below 100°C.<br><br>
8.	The material  was taken to  furnace and  fired  in  the  range  of<br>
1200° - 1400°C.<br>
9.	The material is taken out from the furnace and finished by known<br>
methods for use.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce extraction thimble for application of separation of particles from air or gas or for the collection of suspended perticulate matters present in dust ladden flue gases.<br>
Instead of organic membrane structure, which is susceptible to oxidation along with the fragility under flue thrust particularly at higher temperature in the application areas, here the basic structure of the material is inorganic refractory materials like clay. The pores in the body is generated by the use of combustible materials, original size of the particles of which determines the ultimate pore structure. The invent <br><br>

The process of the present invention can be used to produce extraction thimble for application of separation of particles from air or gas or for the collection of suspended perticulate matters present in dust ladden flue gases.<br>
Instead of organic membrane structure, which is susceptible to oxidation along with the fragility under flue thrust particularly at higher temperature in the application areas, here the basic structure of the material is inorganic refractory materials like clay. The pores in the body is generated by the use of combustible materials, original size of the particles of which determines the ultimate pore structure. The i<br><br>
step of the process of the present invention resides in the replacement of organic and low temperature withstanding membrane structure of the thimble material by inorganic refractory networking using organic combustible waste material. The novelty of the process of the present invention lies in making high temperature withstanding (&gt;1300°C) ceramic extraction thimble from industrial waste material. The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be constructed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

50 gms of dry ground pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with finely ground 50 gms of china clay passed through 300 mesh is taken in a ball mill and 300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 4 hrs. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials were dried in oven at 70°C, kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1350°C. Porosity : 53%, Bulk Density : 1.27<br>

mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials are dried in oven at 80°C. kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1200°C. Porosity : 58%, Bulk Density : 1.03<br>
Example 3<br>
40 gms of dry ground pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with finely ground 60 gms of china clay passed through 300 mesh was taken in a ball mill and 300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 2 hrs. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials are dried in oven at 50°C, kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1350°C. Porosity : 48%. Bulk Density : 1.32<br>
Example 4<br>
To 60 gms of dry ground pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with finely ground 40 gms of china clay passed through 300 mesh was taken in a ball mill and 300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 6 hrs. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials are dried in oven at 80°C, kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1400°C. Porosity : 56%, Bulk Density : 1.25<br><br>
Example 5<br>
70 gms of dry ground pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with finely ground 30 gms of china clay passed through 300 mesh was taken in a ball mill and 300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 3 hrs.

Porosity : 57%, Bulk Density : 1.29<br>
Example 6<br>
35 gms of dry ground charcoal and 10 gms of ground paper pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with 45 gms of alumina and 10 gms china clay passed through 300 mesh was taken in a ball mill and 300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 2 hrs. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials are dried in oven at 90°C, kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1400°C. Porosity : 49%, Bulk Density : 1.30<br>
Example 7<br>
10 gms of dry ground charcoal and 10 gms of ground paper pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with finely ground 70 gms of alumina and 10 gms china clay passed through 300 mesh was taken in a ball mill and<br><br>
300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 7 hrs. The mixture was taken out sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials are dried in oven at 80°C, kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1400°C. Porosity : 40%, Bulk Density : 1.45<br>
Example 8<br>
20 gms of dry ground charcoal and 40 gms of ground paper pulp, sieved through 300 mesh was mixed with finely ground 20 gms of alumina and 20 gms china clay passed through 300 mesh was taken in a ball mill and 300 ml of water was added and ball milled for 5 hrs. The mixture was taken out, sodium silicate was added to make slip and then casted in required moulds. The raw materials are dried in oven at 80°C, kept in an electric furnace and fired at 1350°C. Porosity : 51%, Bulk Density : 1.28 Some of the results are summarised below.<br>
1.	Pyrochemical Cone Equivalent of the thimbles are 1529 to 1621°C<br>
2.	The body is composed of calcined clay with mullite needles with minor<br>
quartz crystals. Mullite needles are more or less uniformly distributed<br>
within the matrix.<br>
3.	When compared with commercial Glass Fibre thimble in case of stack<br>
monitoring the efficiency of dust collection was found to be comparable.<br><br>
4. During sampling the particle penetration inside the matrix is less than<br>
1.0 mm from the inner surface.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
1.	Utilisation of waste material to make a value added product.<br>
2.	Making of extraction thimbles which can be operated at 1300°C quite<br>
easily.<br>
3.	Utilisation of wastes whose disposal is problem<br>
4.	A simple cost effective easy process.<br>
5.	Use of raw materials which are available and easily accessible.<br>
6.	The extraction thimbles do not break even at a pressure drop of<br>
650 mm murcurv.<br><br><br><br><br>
