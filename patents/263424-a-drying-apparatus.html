CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] Benefit is claimed of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/507,466, filed<br>
September 29, 2003 and entitled "HEAT PUMP CLOTHES DRYER", the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated by reference herein as if set forth at length.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a dryer for drying clothes and other things made<br>
from fabric and to a washer for washing same.<br>
[0003] Ordinary dryers are a study in simplicity. As shown in FIG. 30, they draw room air,<br>
pass it over a heater, and blow it through a rotating drum containing laundry to be dried. The<br>
air passes through the drum once, and is then vented out of the building. Some of the air<br>
extracts moisture from the fabric, and some of it bypasses the laundry, and escapes without<br>
doing any work. This is the simplest, least expensive, and the most fallacious way to build a<br>
dryer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a dryer which has<br>
improved performance and efficiency.<br>
[0005] The foregoing object is attained by the present invention.<br>

chamber for containing articles to be dried, means for supplying heated dry air at a first<br>
temperature to the chamber, which air supplying means comprises an air flow pathway<br>
having means for removing moisture from air exiting the chamber and for decreasing the<br>
temperature of the air to below dew point temperature and means for increasing the<br>
temperature of the air exiting the moisture removing means to the first temperature, and a<br>
heat pump system. The heat pump system comprises means for passing a refrigerant in a<br>
liquid state through the temperature increasing means, means for controlling refrigerant mass<br>
flow and for converting the refrigerant from the liquid state to a liquid/vapor state, and means<br>
for passing the refrigerant in the liquid/vapor state through the moisture removing means to<br>
convert the refrigerant into a vapor state.<br>
[0007] In a second aspect of the present invention, a washing apparatus is provided. The<br>
washing apparatus broadly comprises a washing chamber, means for supplying heated water<br>
to the washing chamber, which heated water supplying means comprises a first heat storage<br>
device having a heat exchanger device and an inlet means for receiving water, means for<br>
draining heated water from the washing chamber and passing heat from the heated water to a<br>
drain side heat storage device, and a heat pump system for transferring heat from the drain<br>
side heat storage device to the first heat storage device.<br>
[0008] In yet another aspect of the present invention, a drying chamber for use in a drying<br>
system is provided. The drying chamber comprises a stationary drum and a plurality of<br>
rotating vanes for tumbling the article to be dried.<br>
[0009] Other details of the heat pump clothes dryer of the present invention, as well as<br>
other objects and advantages attended thereto, are set forth in the following detailed<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
Heat Pump Dryer<br>
[0052] Inside the drum, the basic heat pump dryer functions in the same way as a<br>
conventional dryer. Heated dry air enters the drum, extracts moisture from the clothes, and<br>
then leaves the drum, cooler and wetter. The fundamental difference is in the way the heat<br>
pump dryer provides the heated dry air.<br>
[0053] Instead of continually heating room air and then venting it, the heat pump dryer<br>
dries and warms the air from the drum exhaust, and returns it to the drum. Useful heat is<br>
recovered and reused instead of being vented out of the building.<br>
[0054] This is accomplished by connecting the drum exhaust back to the drum intake,<br>
through dehumidifier means. The heat pump dryer uses a closed air loop, with dehumidifier<br>
means in the flow path. The dehumidifier means removes entrained moisture from wet air<br>
exiting the drum, reheats the air, and returns it to the drum. The drum is a rotating drum<br>
which may be rotated by any suitable means known in the art.<br>
[0055] With reference to Figure 1, heated dry air enters rotating drum, 10, at Point 1, and<br>
extracts moisture from the tumbling fabric. Air then leaves the drum, 10, laden with extracted<br>
moisture at Point 2, and enters the main blower, 12, which circulates drying air through the<br>
drying air loop. Air leaves the main blower, 12, at Point 3, and passes through the wet air<br>
heatsink, (heatsink), 14.<br>
[0056] The heatsink, 14, as taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,603,489, which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein, removes heat substantially equal to the power consumption of the heat<br>
pump compressor, 16. In the preferred embodiment, heatsink, 14, is a simple air to air heat<br>
exchanger that conducts heat from the drying air to the ambient air surrounding the dryer.<br>
The drying air does not communicate with the ambient air, only heat is passed. Heatsink, 14,<br>
is preferably cooled with fan or blower driven ambient room air. In an alternate embodiment,<br>
the heatsink, 14, may be a liquid cooled type.<br>
[0057] As the dryer is a closed loop design, continuous removal of heat substantially equal<br>
to power consumption is necessary to control operating temperature. The heatsink, 14,<br>
removes heat after it has performed useful work in the drum, a desirable feature. Alternate<br>
approaches, as taught in prior art, remove heat from the drying air before it enters the drum,<br>
cooling the air entering the drum, and materially compromising performance.<br>
[0058] Drying air exits the heatsink, 14, at point 4, and enters the evaporator, 18, which<br>
cools the air below its dew point. The moisture previously extracted from the fabric<br>
condenses out of the drying air, is collected by drip tray, 20, and drains into collection tank,<br>
22. In the preferred embodiment, an automatic pump, 24, pumps water from the collection<br>
tank, 22, to an external drain connection. Pump, 24, may be controlled by any suitable<br>
method, such as a float switch or electronic level sensor in collection tank, 22. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, collection tank, 22, may be removable for manual emptying.<br>
[0059] The evaporator, 18, extracts sufficient sensible heat to pull the temperature of the air<br>
below its dew point, as well as heat of condensing of the water removed from the fabric. The<br>
required evaporator cooling capacity is thus equal to the sum of the sensible heat and the heat<br>
of condensing.<br>
[0060] Drying air exits the evaporator, 18, at point 6, cool and effectively saturated<br>
(Nominal RH = 85% ~ 90%), and enters the condenser, 26. The condenser 26, reheats the auto<br>
its original temperature at Point 1. The air then exits the condenser, 26, and reenters the<br>
drum, 10, at point 1, completing the cycle. The heating capacity of the condenser, 26, is equal<br>
to the evaporator, 18, cooling capacity plus the power consumption of the heat pump<br>
compressor, 16.<br>
[0061] The additional heat, equal to the power consumption of compressor, 16, that is<br>
added to the drying air by the condenser, 26, does useful work in the drum, 10, incrementally<br>
increasing the moisture extraction rate. This heat is then removed by the heatsink, 14,<br>
maintaining system heat balance.<br>
Heat Pump<br>
[0062] Referring again to Figure 1, the system heat pump operates as a dehumidifier, as<br>
follows: Refrigerant exits the compressor, 16, as high pressure vapor, and passes to condenser<br>
26, at point 1', where heat of condensation (of the refrigerant) is transferred away to the<br>
drying air. The refrigerant condenses, and exits the condenser, 26, at point 2', as high<br>
pressure liquid, and passes through receiver, 28, to thermal expansion valve (TEV), 30, which<br>
reduces the refrigerant pressure. The refrigerant exits the TEV, 30, at point 5', as a low<br>
pressure, low quality liquid/vapor mixture, (high liquid content) and enters the evaporator.<br>
[0063] The evaporator, 18, extracts heat of vaporization of the refrigerant from the drying<br>
air, and boils the refrigerant to the vapor state. Slightly superheated vapor exits the<br>
evaporator, 18, at point 7', and reenters the compressor, 16, completing the cycle.<br>
[0064] The TEV, 30, controls the refrigerant mass flow by proportionally opening and<br>
closing in response to system conditions. In one embodiment, it maintains a constant low<br>
superheat, to maximize evaporator capacity while preventing liquid from entering the<br>
compressor. A plurality of TEV and control embodiments and are discussed in the System<br>
Controls section of this document.<br>
[0065] Control, 32, serves several functions, such as cycle time and dryness control, also<br>
discussed in the System Controls section of this document.<br>
[0066] The control, 32, may be a control and monitoring system implemented using a<br>
micro-controller, micro-computer, or the like. The control, 32, may receive input from<br>
sensors and user input/output devices. The control, 32, may be coupled to various drier<br>
components via control lines (not shown) for controlling the respective operations. Sensors<br>
which may be used with the control, 32, include temperature sensors positioned at various<br>
locations along the air supply flow path and the refrigerant flow path and moisture sensors<br>
positioned at various locations along the air supply flow path.<br>
Heat Pump Dryer Performance and/or Efficiency Improvements<br>
Warmup Considerations<br>
[0067] Textile drying occurs in three phases, Rising Rate or Warmup, Steady State, and<br>
Falling Rate, as discussed in Appendix A: Theoretical Considerations. When the heat pump<br>
dryer is first started, it must reach operating temperature before steady state drying rate is<br>
achieved. In practice, the rising rate phase in a heat pump dryer can be inordinately long,<br>
undesirably increasing the total drying time. The warmup time is a function of the mass of the<br>
heated portions of the dryer and the wet laundry, and the available heat. It is advantageous<br>
that this phase be as short as practical, and the dryer and the wet fabric brought to operating<br>
temperature as rapidly as practical.<br>
Warmup Heat<br>
[0068] In the basic configuration, as shown in Figure 1, the heat pump is the only source of<br>
heat. At normal operating temperatures, the heat pump supplies more heat than needed for<br>
steady state drying, and the excess is released through the heatsink, 14. However, at low<br>
starting temperatures, the refrigerant pressure is low, and as a result, refrigerant mass flow is<br>
low, the heat pump consumes very little power, and supplies very little heat. This causes slow<br>
warmup, and increases the overall drying time.<br>
[0069] Warmup time may be reduced by the addition of a warmup heater, 34, as shown in<br>
Figure 2, which directly heats the drying air, bringing the dryer and the laundry up to<br>
operating temperature in a comparatively short time. In the preferred embodiment, this heater<br>
is energized only until the dryer reaches operating temperature. The heater is preferably as<br>
large as available power permits, because a larger heater presents a shorter warmup period. It<br>
may be used without materially increasing overall energy consumption, because it is used for<br>
only a short time at the beginning of each cycle.<br>
[0070] In an another embodiment, an electric warmup heater may be incorporated in the<br>
refrigerant piping, to either supplement or replace the warmup heater, 34, in the air loop.<br>
Radiant or conduction heating means, discussed in the section Nonconvective Heating, may<br>
also be used for warmup heat, either in lieu of or in conjunction with, a warmup heater in the<br>
air loop and/or the refrigerant circuit.<br>
Alternate Warmup Means<br>
External Evaporator<br>
[0071] An alternate source of warmup heat may be realized by means of an external<br>
warmup evaporator, 36, as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In both embodiments, during<br>
warmup, refrigerant gas passes from evaporator, 18, through warmup evaporator, 36, before<br>
entering compressor, 16. Warmup evaporator, 36, draws heat from the ambient room air,<br>
which is transported by the heat pump to the condenser, 26. This approach supplies warmup<br>
heat equivalent to warmup heater, 34, but takes advantage of the heat pump coefficient of<br>
performance (C.O.P.), consuming less energy than warmup heater, 34, while providing<br>
substantially the same quantity of warmup heat.<br>
[0072] As shown in Figure 3, warmup heat may be controlled by means of Diverter Valve,<br>
38, which switches warmup evaporator, 36, out of the refrigerant circuit when it is not<br>
needed. Diverter valve 38, is preferably a simple 3 way solenoid valve that is activated by<br>
control, 32; however, any suitable valve type may be used.<br>
[0073] When the diverter valve, 38, is in warmup mode, point 7' is connected through the<br>
diverter valve, 38, to point 6B', and point 6' is cut off. Refrigerant then flows from the<br>
evaporator, 18, to the warmup evaporator, 36, at point 6A'. The warmup evaporator, 36,<br>
transfers heat from the room air to the refrigerant. The refrigerant then exits warmup<br>
evaporator, 36, at point 6B', passes through diverter valve, 38, to compressor, 16, suction at<br>
point 7'.<br>
[0074] When diverter valve, 38, is in normal steady state mode, point 7' is connected to<br>
point 6', and point 6B' is cut off. Refrigerant exits evaporator, 18, at point 6, and passes<br>
through diverter valve, 38, to compressor suction at point 7'. Refrigerant does not enter the<br>
warmup evaporator 36 at point 6A' because its discharge, at point 6B', is cut off. In this<br>
mode, refrigerant bypasses the warmup evaporator, 36, entirely.<br>
[0075] In Figure 4, an alternate means of controlling the warmup evaporator, 36, is shown.<br>
In this embodiment, refrigerant passes through the warmup evaporator, 36, continuously.<br>
Warmup evaporator, 36, is enclosed in a preferably insulated housing that substantially<br>
restricts heat transfer and natural convective airflow. When warmup heat is needed, blower,<br>
40, is energized, preferably by control, 32, forcing ambient room air over warmup evaporator,<br>
36. When warmup heat is not needed, blower, 40, is shut down, again preferably by control,<br>
32, and warmup evaporator, 36, is effectively cut off.<br>
Variable Capacity Compressor<br>
[0076] This approach compensates for refrigerant behavior at low temperatures by<br>
increasing the effective volumetric capacity of the compressor during warmup. With<br>
sufficiently increased volumetric capacity, the compressor 16 will draw normal or near<br>
normal power during warmup, and will pump heat at normal or near normal steady rate. This<br>
will provide warmup heat and good heat pump performance during warmup. Preferably, the<br>
compressor 16 is operated at increased capacity during warmup, and then stepped or ramped<br>
down to normal capacity as the dryer reaches desired operating temperature. Compressor<br>
capacity control is preferably handled by Control, shown as item 32 in Figures 1-4.<br>
[0077] This approach is also useful in conjunction with other warmup methods, to insure<br>
proper condensation of water extracted from the laundry during warmup. Variable capacity<br>
may be a feature of the compressor itself; with means such as unloading cylinders, variable<br>
stroke, or the like. Alternatively, a two speed compressor motor, with separate low and high<br>
speed windings, may be used. A preferred method is compressor speed control via variable<br>
frequency drive electronics.<br>
Variable Drying Air Flowrate<br>
[0078] This approach increases compressor power consumption by reducing the drying<br>
loop mass airflow during warmup. This causes the evaporator saturation temperature to drop<br>
slightly, and the condenser saturation temperature to rise, effectively increasing the AT and AP<br>
across the compressor. This in turn reduces the compressor COP, and increases compressor<br>
power consumption.<br>
[0079] The increased compressor power consumption in this mode is commensurate with<br>
that achieved using a variable speed compressor. This approach may be implemented with a<br>
simple electronic blower speed control, or with a two speed or multispeed blower motor; less<br>
expensive to manufacture than a variable speed compressor drive.<br>
[0080] Variable capacity compressor means and variable airflow means may be employed<br>
together, for combined effect. The warmup heater, 34, is not needed in embodiments with<br>
alternate warmup means; if desired, it may be used to supplement the alternate warmup<br>
means, and further reduce warmup time.<br>
Air Economizer<br>
[0081] Control, 32, has been deleted from Figure 5, and subsequent figures, for clarity.<br>
 [0082] An improved embodiment of the heat pump dryer includes an air economizer, 42, as<br>
shown in Figure 5. In this embodiment, the air economizer, 42, is an air to air heat exchanger<br>
which operates as follows: Wet air exits the Heatsink, 14, at point 4, and instead of passing<br>
directly to the evaporator, 18, it first enters the air economizer, 42. Heat from the wet<br>
airstream is transferred through the air economizer, 42, to the cold saturated air exiting the<br>
evaporator, 18, at Point 6. The two airstreams do not communicate, only heat is transferred<br>
between them.<br>
[0083] The cooled wet air then exits the air economizer, 42, and enters the evaporator, 18,<br>
at Point 5. The evaporator 18 cools the air to below dew point, as in previously discussed<br>
embodiments. However, the economizer, 42, has extracted a significant portion of the<br>
sensible heat in the wet air, and as a result, a larger portion of the evaporator, 18, cooling<br>
capacity is available for condensing moisture. This benefit may manifest as a smaller<br>
(reduced cooling capacity) less expensive evaporator, or as increased moisture condensing<br>
rate, as desired.<br>
[0084] Cooled saturated air then leaves the evaporator, 18, and enters the economizer, 42,<br>
at point 6, where it receives heat from the wet air entering at point 4, as discussed above. The<br>
warmed air then leaves the economizer, 42, and enters the condenser, 26, at point 7. The<br>
condenser 26 reheats the air as per previously discussed embodiments, however, the entering<br>
air is significantly warmer, and the required condenser heating capacity is reduced. This may<br>
manifest as a smaller (reduced heating capacity) less expensive condenser, or as increased<br>
heating rate, as desired.<br>
[0085] The heat exchange capacity of the economizer, 42, manifests as additional effective<br>
cooling capacity at the evaporator and additional heating capacity at the condenser, with no<br>
additional energy consumption. For a given evaporator and condenser, the addition of the air<br>
economizer, 42, will result in increased drying rate. If they are made smaller, the compressor,<br>
16, may also be made smaller and less expensive, and the same drying rate will be realized,<br>
with reduced energy consumption.<br>
Refrigerant Subcooler<br>
[0086] The wet air heatsink, 14, is effective as a means for removing heat from the dryer,<br>
after the heat has done useful work. An alternate means for removing heat substantially equal<br>
to the compressor power consumption, an improvement over the wet air heatsink, 14, is<br>
shown in Figure 6.<br>
 [0087] In this embodiment, refrigerant exits the condenser, 26, and enters the refrigerant<br>
subcooler, 44, at point 2'. The subcooler, 44, removes heat substantially equal to the<br>
compressor, 16, power consumption, effectively performing the same function as the<br>
heatsink, 14, which is not needed when subcooler, 44, is used. The heatsink, 14, is shown as<br>
dashed lines to indicate that it is not required.<br>
[0088] Refrigerant exits the subcooler, 44, at point 3', and passes through receiver, 28, to<br>
TEV, 30. The TEV, 30, reduces the refrigerant pressure, as in previously discussed<br>
embodiments. However, the subcooler, 44, has removed substantial heat from the refrigerant,<br>
and it enters TEV, 30, at significantly lower enthalpy. Refrigerant exiting TEV, 30, and<br>
entering evaporator, 18, at point 5' is of much lower quality (more liquid, less gas) when<br>
subcooler, 44, is used. This materially improves the cooling capacity of evaporator, 18.<br>
[0089] The subcooler, 44, has additional advantages over the heatsink, 14. The subcooler,<br>
44, is preferably a refrigerant to air or refrigerant to liquid heat exchanger, as opposed to the<br>
heatsink, 14, which is an air to air heat exchanger. Consequently the subcooler, 44, is more<br>
effective, and may be smaller and less expensive to manufacture.<br>
[0090] The refrigerant entering the subcooler, 44, at point 2' is substantially hotter than the<br>
wet air entering the heatsink, 14, at point 3. Consequently the subcooler, 44, has a larger<br>
approach (AT between the refrigerant, and the cooling fluid, e.g., room air) than does the<br>
heatsink, 14, further improving its effectiveness, and permitting additional size reduction.<br>
[0091] The subcooler 44 also changes the system heat balance. Normally, the condenser,<br>
26, capacity is equal to the evaporator, 18, capacity plus the compressor, 16, power<br>
consumption. However, since compressor, 16, power is removed by the subcooler, 44, energy<br>
balance dictates that the condenser, 26, capacity must equal the evaporator, 18, capacity.<br>
Saturation temperatures are reduced when the subcooler is active, evaporator capacity<br>
increases, and condenser capacity drops, until this equilibrium is reached.<br>
[0092] As saturation temperatures in the system are reduced when the subcooler, 44, is<br>
active, either the evaporator, 18, superheat or the refrigerant mass flow will change<br>
accordingly. This is dependent on TEV, 30, behavior. If the TEV, 30, is configured to<br>
maintain constant superheat, it will increase refrigerant mass flow as needed when the<br>
subcooler, 44, is active, This will commensurately increase heat pump capacity and drying<br>
rate, provided loop airflow is sufficient.<br>
[0093] If evaporator, 18, superheat is permitted to float, then it will increase when<br>
subcooler, 44, is active. This may be advantageous in some embodiments, discussed in the<br>
Refrigerant Economizer section of this document. When the subcooler, 44, is used, increased<br>
refrigerant superheat at the compressor suction, point 7', causes increased superheat in the<br>
refrigerant exiting the compressor, 16, at point 1'. This in turn reduces the condenser, 26,<br>
effectiveness, commensurate with the reduced condenser, 26, capacity required when the<br>
subcooler, 44, is active.<br>
[0094] The subcooler, 44, has an additional advantage when used with the air economizer,<br>
42. When the heatsink, 14, is used, the air economizer, 42, performance is materially reduced<br>
because wet air entering at point 4 has been cooled by the heatsink, 14. When the subcooler,<br>
44, is used, and the heatsink, 14, is preferably not used, and the wet air entering the<br>
economizer, 42, is substantially warmer, substantially increasing economizer, 42,<br>
performance.<br>
[0095] The subcooler 44 may be configured as an air cooled heat exchanger. In the air<br>
cooled embodiment, suitable fan or blower means are preferably included to deliver ambient<br>
room air to the subcooler air side. The fan or blower means preferably draws room air from<br>
the front of the dryer cabinet as close to the floor as practical, where the air is generally<br>
coolest, and exhausts the air at the rear of the cabinet, so as to avoid discharging warm air<br>
toward the operator, and to prevent drawing exhaust air.<br>
[0096] Subcooler, 44, may be enclosed in a preferably insulated housing that substantially<br>
restricts heat transfer and natural convective airflow when fan 6r blower means are not<br>
operating, thus facilitating accurate subcooler, 44, effectiveness control, via cooling airflow<br>
control means.<br>
[0097] Alternatively the subcooler, 44, may be liquid cooled. In this embodiment, the<br>
cooling media may be cold tap water. In a laundry room or laundromat venue, the heat from<br>
the subcooler in each dryer 1002 may be used to preheat wash water for use by a washer<br>
1000. Such a scenario is illustrated in FIGS. 33 and 35. As shown in FIG. 35, multiple<br>
washers 1000 and dryers 1002 may be manifolded together. If desired, an optional<br>
accumulator 1004 may be provided. Each dryer 1002 may be fitted with two common<br>
subcooler discharge water output ports if desired. Both ports are the same, and if only one is<br>
used, the other should be capped. They may be used together for daisy chaining the dryers<br>
together, eliminating the need for a manifold.<br>
[0098] Referring now to FIG. 34, the water cooled dryer subcooler discharge may be used<br>
as a space heating source when supplied to an external radiator 1006 for space heating. If<br>
desired, the external radiator 1006 could be used for dryer cooling.<br>
[0099] If desired, a liquid cooled subcooler, 44, embodiment may be used with a separate<br>
air cooled radiator to cool the liquid coolant. The radiator may be used within a unitary dryer<br>
housing to facilitate component fit, or may be remotely located, for example on a roof, or<br>
may provide useful space or process heat. The radiator may be used for cooling a single dryer<br>
or a plurality of dryers.<br>
Heat Pipe Air Economizer<br>
[00100] An alternate embodiment of the Air Economizer, 42, is shown in Figure 7. In this<br>
embodiment, the air economizer, 42, comprises a heat pipe assembly in two heat exchanger<br>
sections connected by heat pipe means, designated 46 and 48, shown connected by a dashed<br>
line representing heat flux.<br>
[00101] This approach offers thermodynamic performance similar to the air to air<br>
economizer, 42, shown in Figure 5, with added practical manufacturing advantages. These<br>
advantages include the ability to install the economizer, 42, in line with the evaporator, 18,<br>
eliminating the need for crossover air ductwork, and multiple changes of direction in the<br>
airflow path. This embodiment presents reduced air loop pressure drop, and requires less<br>
cabinet space.<br>
[00102] The heat pipe air economizer, 42, operates as follows: Wet air enters the heat pipe<br>
air economizer hot section, 46, at point 4. Heat from the wet air stream is transferred away by<br>
the hot section of the heat pipe economizer, 46. The heat pipe transports this heat to cold<br>
section, 48. The cooled wet air then exits the air economizer hot section, 46, and enters the<br>
evaporator, 18, at Point 5.<br>
[00103] The evaporator cools the air below its dew point, as in previously discussed<br>
embodiments. However, the economizer, 42, has extracted a significant portion of the<br>
sensible heat in the wet air, and as a result, a larger portion of the evaporator, 18, cooling<br>
capacity is available for condensing moisture. This benefit may manifest as a smaller<br>
(reduced capacity) evaporator, or as increased moisture condensing rate, as desired.<br>
[00104] Cooled saturated air then leaves the evaporator, 18, and enters the heat pipe<br>
economizer cold section, 48, at point 6, where it receives heat from the wet air entering at<br>
point 4, via the heat pipe, as discussed above. The warmed air then leaves the heat pipe<br>
economizer cold section, 48, and enters the condenser, 26, at point 7. The condenser, 26,<br>
reheats the air as per previously discussed embodiments. However, the entering air is<br>
significantly warmer, and the required condenser, 26, heating capacity is reduced. This may<br>
manifest as a smaller (reduced capacity) condenser, 26, or as increased heating rate as<br>
desired.<br>
 [00105] As with the air to air economizer, the heat exchange capacity of the economizer, 42,<br>
manifests as additional cooling capacity at the evaporator, 18, and additional heating capacity<br>
at the condenser, 26, with no additional energy consumption. If the evaporator, 18, and<br>
condenser, 26, are not changed, then the addition of the air economizer, 42, will result in<br>
increased drying rate. If the evaporator, 18, and condenser, 26, are made smaller, the<br>
compressor, 16, may also be made smaller, and the same drying rate will be realized with<br>
reduced energy consumption. In Beta level residential lab tests, the air economizer, 42,<br>
reduced energy consumption by 10% ~ 15%.<br>
Refrigerant Economizer<br>
[00106] Additional operating efficiency may be realized with a refrigerant economizer, 50,<br>
as shown in Figure 8. The refrigerant economizer (RE), comprises two sections, 52, and 54.<br>
For clarity, the drawing shows the RE, 50, as two separate sections connected by a dashed<br>
line representing heat flux; typically the two sections comprise a single assembly. The<br>
preferred embodiment is a flat plate type heat exchanger, but any suitable refrigerant grade<br>
heat exchanger, such as coaxial tube, or the like, may be used.<br>
[00107] In operation, referencing Figure 8, refrigerant exits the subcooler, 44, at point 3',<br>
and enters the hot section of the RE, 52. The RE hot section, 52, transfers heat away from the<br>
refrigerant, to its cold section, 54. The refrigerant then exits the RE hot section, 52, at point 4,<br>
and passes through the receiver, 28, to the TEV, 30.<br>
[00108] The TEV, 30, reduces the refrigerant pressure as in previously discussed<br>
embodiments. However, the enthalpy of the refrigerant entering the TEV, 30, is reduced, and<br>
exits the TEV, 30 at point 5' as a lower quality mixture (more liquid, less gas) than when the<br>
RE, 50, is not used. This increases the effective capacity of the evaporator, 18. This benefit<br>
may manifest as a smaller (reduced capacity) evaporator, or as increased moisture condensing<br>
rate, as desired.<br>
[00109] In the preferred embodiment, the RE, 50, is used in conjunction with the subcooler,<br>
44. In this configuration, heat is sequentially removed from the refrigerant in both the<br>
subcooler, 44, and the RE, 50, reducing the enthalpy of the refrigerant entering the TEV, 30,<br>
at point 4', further than with either component alone.<br>
[00110] Refrigerant enters the evaporator, 18, at point 5' at reduced enthalpy, where it<br>
extracts heat of vaporization from the wet air. The refrigerant then exits evaporator, 18, as<br>
slightly superheated vapor, and enters the RE cold section, 54, at point 6'. In the RE cold<br>
section, 54, the refrigerant absorbs heat conducted from the liquid refrigerant in the RE hot<br>
section, 52, and exits the RE cold section, 54, as very superheated vapor. In Beta level lab<br>
testing, typical superheat has been on the order of 100°F.<br>
[0100] The high superheat substantially increases the refrigerant density at the compressor,<br>
16, suction, point 7'. If compressor, 16, is a constant displacement type, the increased<br>
refrigerant density at point 7' results in increased refrigerant mass flow. The high temperature<br>
at the compressor suction, point 7', also improves compressor isentropic efficiency.<br>
[0101] In Beta level lab testing, the refrigerant mass flow increase has been on the order of<br>
20%. This may manifest as increased heat pump capacity, and concurrent increased drying<br>
rate, or alternatively, a less expensive, smaller displacement compressor may be used with the<br>
RE, 50, with no performance degradation.<br>
[0102] The high superheat delivered by the RE, 50, permits novel control methods. It is not<br>
necessary to maintain a margin of superheat at the evaporator, 18, discharge, point 6',<br>
because with the RE, 50, in use, there is no risk of liquid entering the compressor at point 7'.<br>
An alternate control algorithm that maintains constant temperature of the air exiting the<br>
evaporator, 18, at point 6, may be used, as discussed in the Controls section of this document.<br>
[0103] The refrigerant economizer, 50, is shown in Figure 8 with the preferred heat pipe air<br>
economizer. It may alternately be used with an air to air economizer such as shown in Figures<br>
5 &amp; 6; or with no air side economizer, at some loss of performance and efficiency. The RE,<br>
50, may also be used with the heatsink, 14, with or in lieu of the subcooler, 44.<br>
Alternate Configuration<br>
[0104] Figure 9 shows an alternate configuration in which the relative locations of the<br>
subcooler, 44, and the RE, 50, are interchanged. This is generally not a preferred<br>
embodiment, but can be advantageous if a liquid cooled subcooler, 44, is desired. The<br>
advantage of a liquid cooled subcooler, 44, is the ability to extract more heat, especially in<br>
hot ambient conditions. However, the refrigerant exiting a liquid cooled subcooler, 44, is<br>
sufficiently cold as to restrict or prevent useful heat extraction by the RE, 50, in the<br>
previously discussed embodiment of Figure 8.<br>
[0105] The alternate embodiment of Figure 9, eliminates this limitation; the RE, 50,<br>
receives refrigerant directly from the condenser 26, at point 2', which is sufficiently hot to<br>
permit good RE, 50, performance, and the water cooled subcooler, 44, has sufficient<br>
approach to permit good subcooler performance with refrigerant exiting the RE, 50, at point<br>
3'.<br>
Compressor Desuperheater<br>
[0106] A compressor desuperheater, 56 may be used as shown in Figure 14 to further<br>
increase refrigerant mass flow for a given compressor. The increased mass flow may be used<br>
toward increased drying rate, or a smaller less expensive compressor, may be used, with no<br>
loss in performance.<br>
Low Temperature Drying<br>
[0107] During steady state, increasing the drum inlet temperature does not materially affect<br>
the drum exhaust dew point, as shown in the examples of Figure 25. However, it does<br>
increase the drum exhaust dry bulb temperature. This introduces significant sensible heat that<br>
must be removed by the wet air heat sink and/or the evaporator, before moisture condensation<br>
can commence.<br>
[0108] The sensible heat represents parasitic work that is not used for drying the clothes.<br>
As the drum inlet dry bulb temperature rises, the sensible heat rises concurrently. For a given<br>
evaporator size, it is possible for the sensible heat to exceed the evaporator cooling capacity,<br>
leaving no cooling capacity for condensation of water. An example of this is shown in Figure<br>
26. It is substantially more efficient to operate with the lowest practical level of sensible heat.<br>
[0109] There is a lower limit to this approach. If the drum exhaust temperature is low<br>
enough, then condensate may freeze on the evaporator surface. This has compromising<br>
effects on air mass flow and heat transfer. During steady state, the preferred configuration<br>
employs drum inlet air as dry as practical, and operating temperatures just high enough to<br>
prevent freezing.<br>
[0110] Low temperature drying reduces or eliminates warmup time, uses less energy, and is<br>
gentler to the fabric, with no compromise in performance. This is discussed in more detail in<br>
Appendix A; Theoretical Considerations.<br>
Improved Airflow<br>
Horizontal Updraft Fluidized Bed Airflow<br>
 [0111] Conventional residential dryers generally employ downdraft airflow, or airflow with<br>
a prominent downdraft component. Most residential dryers employ a drum inlet high on the<br>
rear bulkhead, and a drum exhaust on the front bulkhead, below the door. A small number of<br>
residential dryers employ horizontal airflow from back to front, employing a door comprising<br>
a downdraft perforated plenum. This design also introduces a significant downdraft<br>
component to the airflow. Another design locates both drum inlet and exhaust on opposite<br>
sides the rear bulkhead, with the inlet located higher on the bulkhead than the exhaust. No<br>
dryers currently employ updraft airflow, or airflow with a significant updraft component.<br>
[0112] Downdraft airflow is disadvantageous to tumble drying. It drives the falling fabric<br>
downward, reducing critical falling dwell time, and compacting the falling items closer to<br>
each other. Fabric is driven forward, as well as downward toward the drum exhaust, causing a<br>
tendency to occlude the exhaust vent. These factors compromise performance and efficiency.<br>
[0113] An alternate airflow path may be advantageously applied, as shown in Figure 12.<br>
Typical conventional airflow is shown in Figure 12A. Air enters the drum near the top, at the<br>
rear, at point 58, and travels forward and downward, exiting under the door, at point 60.<br>
Figure 12B illustrates improved airflow, in which air enters the drum under the door, at point<br>
58', and exits near the top of the rear bulkhead, at point 60'.<br>
[0114] In this embodiment, the updraft component of the airflow tends to fluidize the bed;<br>
falling fabric items are falling against the airflow rather than with it, and fall more slowly,<br>
extending critical dwell time. Falling items tend to fluff and separate rather than aggregate,<br>
and exposure to drying air is substantially enhanced. The effects of the horizontal component<br>
of the airflow are substantially mitigated. Fabric items do not bunch up at the bottom front or<br>
rear of the drum, and do not occlude the drum exhaust. This embodiment provides improved<br>
moisture extraction and drying performance.<br>
[0115] An alternative embodiment, comprises a drum inlet on the rear bulkhead, situated<br>
near or at the bottom, and a front drum exhaust. The door may be constructed as a plenum,<br>
with the front drum exhaust at or near the top of the door, or alternatively, the drum exhaust<br>
may be in the front bulkhead, above the door. These embodiments present the same<br>
advantageous updraft airflow, with the added benefit of more accessible lint filter location.<br>
[0116] If the drum exhaust is in the door, the lint filter may also be located in the door,<br>
preferably near the top, to be reached easily for removal. The filter assembly may be<br>
configured for access from inside the door, from the top of the door, or from the outside of<br>
the door, as desired. If the drum exhaust is in the bulkhead above the door, the filter assembly<br>
may be configured for easy access from the front of the dryer, above the door, or from the top<br>
of the dryer, at the front, as desired.<br>
Vertical Updraft Fluidized Bed Airflow<br>
[0117] Conventional commercial and industrial dryers generally employ vertical downdraft<br>
airflow. This is believed to be a safety requirement commensurate with the use of large<br>
electric or gas fired heaters for heating the drying air. Placing a large heater or burner directly<br>
under a load of fabric is not intrinsically safe. Consequently, the heater is generally located<br>
above the drum, and vertical downdraft air is employed. This approach is disadvantageous; it<br>
drives the falling clothes down toward the bottom of the drum, compacting the falling items<br>
and substantially reducing dwell time. The exhaust draft pulls the fabric to the bottom of the<br>
drum, substantially occluding the drum exhaust.<br>
[0118] The heat pump dryer does not present the intrinsic fire hazard of electric and gas<br>
fired units, and is well suited to vertical updraft airflow. An example embodiment that may<br>
be advantageously applied is shown in Figure 13. As shown in Figure 13A, in conventional<br>
dryers, air enters the drum from the top, at point 62, and travels vertically downward, exiting<br>
through the bottom of the drum at point 64. In the improved embodiment, shown in Figure<br>
13B, air enters from the bottom of the drum, at point 62', and travels vertically, exiting<br>
through the top of the drum, at point 64'.<br>
[0119] This embodiment presents substantially improved tumbling action; longer falling<br>
dwell time, and improved separation of the fabric items, with commensurate improved<br>
exposure to drying air. Drum exhaust occlusion is eliminated, and drying airflow is<br>
substantially enhanced. Moisture extraction and drying performance may be substantially<br>
improved with this embodiment.<br>
Nonconvective Heating<br>
[0120] During steady state convective drying, used by all conventional tumble dryers, and<br>
by heat pump dryer embodiments previously discussed in this document, the overall core<br>
fabric temperature will not exceed the wet bulb temperature of the air in the drum. This<br>
phenomenon is not affected by the dry bulb temperature of the air entering the drum, as<br>
discussed in the above section, Low Temperature Drying.<br>
 [0121] Nonconvective heat sources do not suffer this limitation, and present effective and<br>
novel methods for enhancing dryer performance. These methods are capable of achieving<br>
fabric temperature and drum exhaust dew point substantially higher than convective heating,<br>
thus reducing warmup time, increasing drying rate, and improving efficiency.<br>
Electric Nonconvective Heating<br>
[0122] In one embodiment, radiant heat means may be placed so as to directly heat the<br>
fabric, for example in the door, facing rearward toward the drum interior. This approach is<br>
effective, but consumes additional energy. An alternate approach employs electric resistance<br>
heaters attached to a portion of the drum wall, also effective, but also consumes additional<br>
energy. This latter approach also introduces the need for rotating electrical connections, or a<br>
stationary drum, as discussed in the next section of this document.<br>
Heat Pump Nonconvective Heating<br>
[0123] In a preferred embodiment, conductive heating means are implemented, as shown in<br>
Figure 10, comprising a heated drum wall, 66, that directly heats the fabric via conduction.<br>
The drum wall, 66, includes a refrigerant heat exchanger, of any suitable construction, over a<br>
suitable portion of its circumference.<br>
[0124] At any given time during normal tumbling, a portion of the fabric items are falling,<br>
a portion are being lifted by the drum vanes, and a portion of the items are resting in a dense<br>
pile at the bottom of the drum. In the preferred embodiment, the portion of the drum<br>
circumference that is heated corresponds with the portion of the drum circumference that is<br>
occupied by fallen fabric during tumbling. This is typically the bottom third of the drum<br>
circumference.<br>
[0125] In one embodiment, serpentine tubing may be bonded to the heated portion of the<br>
drum wall, 66, by welding, soldering, or other suitable means. Alternatively, the heated<br>
portion of drum wall, 66, may include integrated flow channels, of the type commonly used<br>
in small refrigerator evaporators. The drum wall exterior is preferably insulated to minimize<br>
heat loss.<br>
[0126] In operation, high pressure superheated refrigerant exits the compressor, 16, at point<br>
1', and enters the drum wall, 66, heating the drum wall, 66, and conducting heat to the fabric<br>
resting on the bottom of the drum. The fabric temperature is thus raised above the wet bulb<br>
temperature of the surrounding air, substantially increasing the moisture extraction rate.<br>
[0127] In the preferred embodiment, the drum wall heat exchanger, 66, substantially<br>
desuperheats the refrigerant, but does not condense it. This permits simpler, less expensive,<br>
drum wall design, and provides ample heat for substantially increased drying rate. The nearly<br>
saturated refrigerant then exits the drum wall, 66, at point 1A' and enters the condenser, 16.<br>
[0128] The remaining portion of the refrigerant cycle is effectively similar to previously<br>
discussed embodiments, except that the heating capacity of condenser, 16, is reduced by the<br>
heating capacity of drum wall, 66. This is not a disadvantage, as the total heat applied to the<br>
drum is the sum of the heat supplied by the condenser, 16, and the drum wall, 66.<br>
[0129] In this embodiment, the drying air entering the drum, 10, at point 1, is slightly<br>
cooler than in embodiments not using heated drum wall, 66. This air functions primarily as a<br>
carrier to remove extracted moisture from the drum, and need only be hotter than the wet<br>
bulb temperature exiting the drum, nominally equivalent to the surface temperature of the<br>
fabric. Performance using heated drum wall, 66, will be substantially improved over<br>
convection heated embodiments.<br>
[0130] If the refrigerant economizer, 50, is used with the heated drum wall, the resulting<br>
increase in compressor discharge superheat will increase the available heat at the drum wall,<br>
further increasing the moisture extraction rate in the drum.<br>
Rotating Drum<br>
[0131] In a variation of this embodiment, the entire rotating drum circumference may be<br>
heated, and preferably with insulated exterior. Refrigerant may be coupled to the drum wall<br>
heat exchanger through rotating fittings. Alternatively, electric drum wall heat may be<br>
similarly implemented with electric heaters on the drum wall, and slip rings for the electrical<br>
connections.<br>
Stationary Drum, Rotating Vane Cage<br>
[0132] The fundamental purpose of drum rotation is to tumble the fabric being dried.<br>
Tumbling is an essential and integral function of forced convection drying. Tumbling<br>
fluidizes the bed, and circulates the fabric items. The fabric is exposed to drying air primarily<br>
while it is falling.<br>
 [0133] The drum wall itself does not contribute materially to tumbling; this is the function<br>
of the lifting vanes, which are attached to the drum wall. As the drum and vanes rotate, when<br>
the vanes are below the horizontal centerline of the drum, their incident angle is upward, and<br>
they catch fabric items and lift them. When the vanes are sufficiently above the horizontal<br>
center line that their incident angle is downward, the fabric items slip off, and fall toward the<br>
bottom of the drum.<br>
[0134] This occurs near, but not at, top dead center. The rotational velocity imparted to the<br>
fabric by the vanes, causes the fabric to fall in a slight arc, such that it tends to fall primarily<br>
through the vertical centerline of the drum. If the drum did not have vanes, the fabric would<br>
slip along the drum wall without significant lifting, and tumbling effect would be reduced to<br>
negligibility.<br>
[0135] To facilitate a heated drum wall in a practical manufacturable manner, it is<br>
advantageous to couple the heat exchanger (HX) means to the refrigerant piping circuit,<br>
without rotating slip joints or the like. In a novel preferred embodiment, the drum does not<br>
rotate. This permits simple and low cost serpentine tubing or other suitable HX means to be<br>
attached directly to the drum wall, and coupled to the refrigerant piping by conventional<br>
means, known in the HVAC industry, such as soldering, brazing, or the like. Alternatively,<br>
the heated portion of drum wall may include integrated flow channels, commonly used in<br>
small refrigerator evaporators.<br>
[0136] In a preferred embodiment, shown in Figures 16 - 19, tumbling is accomplished by<br>
independently rotating a group of vanes 68, inside a stationary drum, 70. These vanes, 68, are<br>
preferably supported by annular rings, 72 at the front, and 74 at the rear, of the drum, 70. The<br>
rings and vanes together form a cage that fits snugly inside the drum and is rotated by a<br>
suitable driving means, such as an electric motor.<br>
[0137] The inside diameter of the front ring, 72, is large enough to provide access clearance<br>
for loading and unloading the laundry, with suitable door means. The front ring, 72, may be<br>
supported by rollers, 76, in Figure 18, which bear on the inside surface of the stationary<br>
drum, 70. The rear ring, 74, may be formed as a perforated disk to facilitate supporting with<br>
an axle shaft. In the latter perforated embodiment, the perforations permit drying air to pass<br>
through the disk.<br>
[0138] The axle shaft, not shown, passes through the rear wall of the stationary drum, and<br>
may be attached to a suitable drive pulley or sprocket, 78, as shown in Figure 19. Pulley or<br>
sprocket 78, may be coupled via belt or chain, 80, to a drive motor, 82. The shaft is<br>
preferably supported by suitable bearing means in the rear drum wall. A suitable shaft seal is<br>
preferably provided at the bearing location to prevent air leakage.<br>
[0139] In a variation of this embodiment, one or both rings, 72 &amp; 74, fit snugly inside the<br>
drum, and may be fabricated from or covered with a low friction material, such as UHMW<br>
polyethylene or Teflon, such as is currently used in the supporting drum glides in many<br>
conventional residential dryers. Alternatively, the low friction material may be applied to the<br>
inside surface of the drum, along the glide path of the rings.<br>
[0140] In another alternate embodiment, the vane cage may fully be cantilevered to the rear<br>
axle shaft, eliminating the need for rollers, 76, or glides at the front.<br>
[0141] These embodiments have the added advantage of eliminating drum rim seals. No<br>
moving seal is required at the front of the drum, which is effectively sealed by the door<br>
gasket; the rear requires only a simple conventional shaft seal.<br>
[0142] In an alternate embodiment, shown in Figures 21 &amp; 22, the stationary drum, 70, is<br>
comprised of two half shells, 70A &amp; 70S, with a slot around the centerline. The front half<br>
shell preferably includes an opening on its end wall (not shown) for loading and unloading<br>
laundry, with suitable door means. A single ring, 84, fits between the drum shells, 70A &amp;<br>
70B, and supports each vane, 68, at its center. The ring, 84, may be primarily inside the drum<br>
as shown in Figure 21, primarily outside the drum, or may be double layered, bearing on both<br>
the inside and outside surfaces of the drum, with integral edge grooves, in which the open<br>
ends of each drum shell ride.<br>
[0143] At least a portion of ring, 68, is preferably exposed through the slot between the<br>
drum half shells, 70A &amp; 70B, and a drive belt, 80, may be wrapped around it to provide<br>
rotation, with suitable driving means, such as an electric motor, 82. The ring, 84, may include<br>
supporting rollers or bearing balls, riding inside and/or outside the drum wall. Alternatively,<br>
the ring, 84, may include glide strips or bands of Teflon or UHMW polyethylene, or other<br>
suitable low friction bearing material, such as is used to support the drum in many<br>
conventional residential dryers.<br>
[0144] Suitable sealing means, such as the drum sealing method discussed in the Drum<br>
Sealing section of this document, are preferably provided at the interfaces between the ring,<br>
84, and the drum shells, 70A, &amp; 70B.<br>
[0145] The vanes, 68, are preferably tapered, thick at the root, and thin at the distal edges,<br>
and forward curved where they contact the drum wall. The vanes or the leading edges are<br>
preferably made from a flexible, low friction material, such as UHMW polyethylene, Teflon,<br>
or other suitable material, and may include suitable internal structural means as needed.<br>
 [0146] The vanes, 68, preferably have sufficient resilience and travel at their leading edges<br>
to maintain contact with the drum wall, and absorb drum shape tolerance and runout, such as<br>
that commonly found in consumer grade dryers. As the vane cage rotates, the vanes, 68,<br>
travel under the fabric items at the bottom of the drum, and lift them to the top or nearly to<br>
the top, where they are permitted to fall, thus facilitating tumbling action in the stationary<br>
drum, 70.<br>
[0147] Although unlikely, it is conceivable that an article of clothing may become caught<br>
between the drum wall and a vane, 68. To address this, the vane cage assembly may be of<br>
slightly smaller diameter than the drum. In this embodiment, the vane cage is positioned<br>
slightly below the axial center of the drum, such that vanes contact the drum wall firmly at<br>
the bottom, and begin to separate from the drum wall as they approach the top of the drum.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates the preferred swept volume, 86, of the rotating vanes.<br>
[0148] As the vanes 68 approach the top of the drum 70, they separate from the drum wall<br>
freeing any clothing caught between the wall and a vane, 68, and permitting it to drop to the<br>
bottom. In the preferred embodiment, the maximum clearance between the vanes, 68, and the<br>
drum wall is approximately /4" to 1" at the top of the drum 70.<br>
[0149] An alternate embodiment comprises electric heat means or refrigerant heat<br>
exchanger means on the rear and/or front drum bulkheads, which are typically stationary in<br>
residential dryers. This is less effective than heating the bottom of the drum circumference,<br>
but may be less expensive to manufacture.<br>
[0150] In a more effective variation of a heated bulkhead embodiment, the rear bulkhead<br>
may be heated, and the drum tilted back, for example 30° ~ 45° from horizontal, thus<br>
improving overall contact between the laundry and the heated rear bulkhead.<br>
Stationary Drum, Commercial Dryers<br>
[0151] Large conventional commercial dryers, typically with capacities of 50 pounds or<br>
more, employ vertical airflow. These dryers have a stationary drum in which an inner basket<br>
rotates. The inner basket is perforated over its entire cylinder wall. The lifter vanes are<br>
attached to the inner basket. The outer drum includes an opening at the top and bottom, each<br>
of which generally extends from front to back. These openings are sufficiently wide to permit<br>
adequate airflow, typically 10% ~ 15% of the drum circumference. Heated air typically enters<br>
the top opening, passes through the perforated rotating inner basket, and wet air exits through<br>
the bottom opening.<br>
 [0152] To facilitate a heated drum wall in this type of dryer, the inner perforated basket<br>
may be eliminated, and a vane cage, similar to that discussed in the previous section, may be<br>
used. An schematic example of this is shown in Figure 29, which also illustrates preferred<br>
updraft airflow. In the preferred updraft embodiment, heated air, 88, enters the bottom<br>
opening and wet air, 90, exits through the top opening.<br>
[0153] To support the heavy loads encountered in commercial dryers, the vane cage is<br>
preferably of high structural strength and stiffness. The rear ring may be formed as a solid<br>
disk, and the front ring may be formed as a ring with a large inside diameter to accommodate<br>
the door. This will provide good structural integrity, and permit unimpeded vertical airflow.<br>
[0154] As the vanes, 68, are in resilient contact with the drum wall, they may undesirably<br>
expand into the top, 92, and/or bottom, 94, airflow openings in the stationary drum, and<br>
become lodged against the far edge of each opening. To prevent this, and to prevent the<br>
laundry from entering the airflow openings, the stationary drum wall may be formed of an<br>
effectively contiguous material, such as sheet metal, and perforated in the area of each<br>
airflow opening, 92 &amp; 94, preferably at the top and bottom of the drum 70. Laundry and<br>
vanes can pass cleanly over the perforated area.<br>
Heated Drum Cool Down<br>
[0155] The heat pump dryer generally does not require a cool down period; the fabric is<br>
generally cool enough to handle at the end of a drying cycle, when the dryer is operating in<br>
the preferred low temperature range. However, conduction heating sources, e.g., heated drum<br>
wall means, preferably operate at temperatures exceeding 140° F, and cool down means are<br>
preferred for safe and comfortable unloading and reloading of the dryer without a lengthy<br>
cool down period.<br>
[0156] In a simple embodiment, the cool down cycle is a control function. At the end of the<br>
drying cycle, the control means may open the TEV, 30, permitting high pressure refrigerant<br>
to rapidly expand and cool. This will effectively cool the accessible surfaces of the drum wall<br>
to a safe temperature.<br>
[0157] In situations where time is critical, such as commercial operations, a more rapid<br>
cool down may be advantageously achieved with an alternate embodiment. This embodiment<br>
includes valve means, preferably of the electric solenoid type, such as those used in reversible<br>
residential HVAC heat pumps.<br>
 [0158] When the drying cycle ends, valve means are activated, preferably by control, 32,<br>
redirecting the flow of refrigerant. In the redirected mode, low pressure refrigerant enters the<br>
drum wall from the TEV, 30, and the drum wall effectively becomes the evaporator. During<br>
this mode, the main blower may be shut down, effectively cutting off the condenser, and<br>
permitting the subcooler to condense refrigerant, removing heat from the system.<br>
[0159] This embodiment effectively chills the drum wall, providing very rapid cool down.<br>
This mode will generally be needed for a very short time at the end of each drying cycle.<br>
When the dryer is sufficiently cooled, the system may be shut down, and the diverter valve<br>
returned to normal mode.<br>
[0160] Another alternate embodiment includes valve means to configure both the<br>
condenser and the drum wall to act as evaporators, cooling both the drum wall, and the<br>
airstream, thus removing heat from the dryer and the fabric via the subcooler. In this<br>
embodiment, during cool down mode, the heat released via the subcooler equals the heat<br>
removed plus the power consumption. To accommodate this, the compressor may be operated<br>
at reduced capacity, via speed control, or the like.<br>
[0161] Alternatively, the subcooler capacity may be larger than necessary for normal<br>
drying, and modulated as necessary to control drying temperature, by means discussed in the<br>
System Controls section of this document. In cool down mode, the subcooler may then be<br>
operated at full capacity, sufficient to remove the heat equal to the power consumption, as<br>
well as cool the drum and fabric.<br>
Drum Sealing<br>
[0162] Drum sealing is an important aspect of heat pump dryer design. Minor air leaks<br>
around the drum, generally unimportant in conventional dryers, can materially degrade heat<br>
pump dryer performance. Room air leaking into the drum can reduce the drying air<br>
temperature and raise the humidity, compromising moisture extraction. Air leaking from the<br>
drum into the surrounding room can cause excessive heat loss, and undesirably raise room<br>
humidity.<br>
[0163] A preferred embodiment for typical residential heat pump dryers, with rotating<br>
drums and stationary bulkheads, is shown in Figures 23 and 24. This embodiment comprises<br>
integral flanges, 96, incorporated in the front and rear bulkheads, parallel with the drum wall,<br>
98. Only rear bulkhead, 100, is shown. Drum wall, 98, includes a sealing area, 102, front and<br>
rear, which may be of the same diameter as the drum, or may be stepped to a slightly smaller<br>
diameter than the drum, as shown.<br>
[0164] An elastomeric seal member, 104, is preferably interposed between the flange, 96,<br>
and the drum wall seal area, 102. Seal member, 104, is of a 'D' cross section or other<br>
suitable profile, with sufficient resilience and travel to absorb drum shape tolerance and<br>
runout, commonly found in consumer grade dryers, while maintaining good sealing contact<br>
with the drum wall sealing area, 102.<br>
[0165] Seal member, 104, is preferably bonded to flange, 96, with double faced tape, self<br>
adhesive backing, or other suitable means, and drum wall sealing area, 102, is then the sliding<br>
seal surface. In the preferred embodiment, the seal assembly is not weight bearing, and the<br>
drum is rotationally supported by separate means. Reduced friction means, such as Teflon or<br>
UHMW polyethylene tape, may be bonded to the drum wall sealing area, 102, along the<br>
contact line of the sealing member, 104, to reduce rotational drag.<br>
[0166] Alternatively, seal member 104, may be bonded to drum sealing area, 102, with 'D'<br>
profile facing outwards, in orientation opposite that shown, and flange, 96, is then the sliding<br>
sealing surface. Reduced friction means may be bonded to flange, 96, to reduce drag. A<br>
single sealing member, 104, or a plurality of sealing members may be used, as desired.<br>
[0167] In an alternate embodiment, not shown, flange 96, may be eliminated, and drum<br>
wall sealing area may be folded inward, 90° to drum wall, 98, and parallel with bulkhead,<br>
100, forming an inner flange on drum wall, 98. Sealing member 104, may then be bonded to<br>
the drum wall sealing area, or to the mating portion of the bulkhead, 100, forming a face<br>
seal.<br>
[0168] The location of blower, 12, is generally not critical, however it is preferably located<br>
at the drum exhaust, to induce slight negative air pressure in the drum, preventing any<br>
moisture or heat from escaping into the room.<br>
System Controls<br>
[0169] Control, 32, shown in Figures 1-4, serves several functions. In the most basic<br>
embodiment, the control, 32, may comprise a simple timer, preferably electronic, that starts<br>
the system and stops it after a preselected running time elapses. It preferably performs startup<br>
sequentially, to minimize electrical surge loads and to establish drum rotation and airflow<br>
before starting the compressor, 16.<br>
 [0170] In the preferred sequence, the control, 32, first starts the blower, 12, then starts the<br>
drum, 10, rotation, and then starts the compressor, 16. The time between these events is<br>
preferably sufficient for the blower to reach full speed before starting the compressor, e.g., 1 -<br>
2 seconds, however any desirable delay may be employed. In another alternate embodiment,<br>
the drum, 10, and blower, 12, may be driven by the same motor. Additional functionality of<br>
control, 32, may include temperature and/or humidity control, safety limits, cycle selection,<br>
and the like.<br>
[0171] In the preferred embodiment, fabric dryness is monitored by control, 32, and the<br>
system is shut down automatically when desired dryness is achieved; this is discussed in the<br>
Dryness Control section of this document. Such a system is shown in FIG. 38. As shown<br>
therein a drum air in, humidity sensor 1040 and a drum air in temperature sensor 1042 are<br>
provided at the inlet to the drying drum 10. Also provided are a drum air out temperature<br>
sensor 1044 and a drum air outlet humidity sensor 1046 at the outlet of the drum 10. Each of<br>
the sensors 1040, 1042, 1044 , and 1046 provides a signal to the control 32 which determines<br>
the fabric moisture and provides a signal to shutoff the dryer when a desired moisture is<br>
attained. Logic flow charts of sample algorithms which may be used in such a system are<br>
shown in FIGS. 40 - 42. FIG. 40 shows a differential temperature algorithm. FIG. 41 shows<br>
a differential humidity algorithm. FIG. 42 shows a combined differential humidity and<br>
temperature algorithm. The intent of all these algorithms is to recognize when the aggregate<br>
fabric load is dry, and then check for individual wet items. Typically, an isolated item will be<br>
wet when the rest of the load is dry, because it was wrapped in another item or is of<br>
substantially heavier fabric than the rest of the load. In this instance, as the wet time tumbles<br>
past the drum exhaust, the temperature will briefly fall and the relative humidity will briefly<br>
rise. Either may reset dwell time.<br>
[0172] While FIG. 38 shows both temperature and relative humidity sensors, both are not<br>
required. Optionally, the dwell timer may also be reset by a dT/dt or dRH/dt spike. For<br>
example, if differential temperature is used as shown in FIG. 40, a single relative humidity<br>
sensor at the drum exhaust or outlet may also be employed. If, during the dwell time, there is<br>
a rapid rise in exhaust relative humidity, faster than a threshold slope, this will also reset the<br>
dwell timer.<br>
Temperature Control<br>
 [0173] It is desirable to maintain relatively constant operating temperature during drying.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the evaporator saturation temperature is kept as low as practical<br>
without causing ice accumulation. The dryer temperature may preferably be controlled by<br>
modulating the effectiveness of the wet air heatsink, 14, and/or the subcooler, 44, as desired.<br>
[0174] It is desirable to accomplish temperature control with as little hysteresis as practical,<br>
particularly when the subcooler, 44, and refrigerant economizer, 50, are both used.<br>
[0175] The refrigerant economizer, 50, transfers more heat when the subcooler, 44, is cut<br>
off. When the subcooler, 44, is switched on or off, e.g. via fan cycling, the TEV, 30,<br>
typically requires 15 ~30 seconds to equalize; an inefficient transitional state. Proportional<br>
control is thus preferable to on/off control for this embodiment, and is advantageous for all<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0176] FIG. 31 illustrates a further embodiment of a heat pump dryer system in accordance<br>
with the present invention wherein a temperature sensor 1010 is placed just outside the hot air<br>
inlet to the drying drum 10. The sensor 1010 provides a signal representative of the<br>
temperature at the inlet of the drying drum 10 to a temperature control 1012. The<br>
temperature control 1012 generates a fan speed control signal which is used to operate a<br>
subcooler fan or blower 1014. The fan or blower 1014 utilizes cooling air from a room or<br>
other suitable source to air cool the subcooler 44.<br>
[0177] FIG. 32 illustrates still another embodiment of a heat pump dryer system in<br>
accordance with the present invention where the temperature sensor 1010 provides a signal<br>
representative of the temperature at the inlet of the drying drum 10 to a temperature control<br>
1012. The temperature control 1012 generates a cooling water control signal which is fed to<br>
a cooling water control valve 1016. The valve 1016 receives cooling water from a facility<br>
water supply or other suitable source and supplies the cooling water to a water cooled<br>
subcooler 44. As shown in FIG. 32, the outlet of the water cooled subcooler may be<br>
connected to a discharge water accumulator 1018. If desired, water in the accumulator 1018<br>
may be discharged to a heat load such as a washer as shown in FIG. 35.<br>
Heatsink<br>
[0178] In embodiments using the wet air heatsink, the heatsink, 14, may be modulated by<br>
means of active mechanical dampers; varying the volume flow of cooling room airflow over<br>
the heatsink, or varying heatsink bypass in the drying air loop.<br>
 [0179] Alternatively, modulation may be accomplished by cycling the heatsink fan, or<br>
preferably, by varying the heatsink fan speed. Variable fan speed, will advantageously reduce<br>
or eliminate parasitic temperature hysteresis that is typically encountered with fan cycling.<br>
[0180] In fan controlled embodiments, the heatsink, 14, may be enclosed in a preferably<br>
insulated housing that substantially restricts heat transfer and natural convective airflow when<br>
the fan or blower is not operating, thus facilitating accurate control of heatsink, 14,<br>
effectiveness with variable cooling airflow means.<br>
Subcooler<br>
[0181] In embodiments using the subcooler, modulation may be accomplished with diverter<br>
valve means, that switch the subcooler in or out of the refrigerant circuit, as desired, in a<br>
manner similar to the warmup evaporator diverter valve, shown as item 38, in Figure 3.<br>
[0182] Alternatively, the subcooler fan may be cycled as needed to modulate the subcooler.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, subcooler modulation is accomplished with variable fan speed,<br>
which achieves modulation without the hysteresis introduced by fan cycling.<br>
[0183] In fan controlled embodiments, the subcooler, 44 may be enclosed in a preferably<br>
insulated housing that substantially restricts heat transfer and natural convective airflow when<br>
the fan or blower is not operating, thus facilitating accurate control of subcooler, 44,<br>
effectiveness with variable cooling airflow means.<br>
Thermal Expansion Valve<br>
[0184] The thermal expansion valve (TEV), 30, may be configured to maintain constant or<br>
near constant superheat at the evaporator discharge. This may be accomplished with a simple<br>
mechanical TEV, 30, of the sensing bulb type, or preferably with a stepper motor type valve,<br>
under proportional or PID control.<br>
[0185] In an alternate embodiment, the TEV, 30, may be configured to ignore evaporator<br>
superheat, and seek to maintain constant air temperature exiting the evaporator. This is the<br>
most direct method of maintaining evaporator air temperature as low as practical without<br>
freezing.<br>
[0186] This latter approach ignores evaporator superheat, which may in practice approach<br>
zero (saturated vapor). This will not compromise performance, or introduce risk of liquid<br>
entering the compressor, if it is used with the refrigerant economizer, 50. The refrigerant<br>
economizer, 50, introduces substantial superheat at the compressor suction, and saturated<br>
vapor at the evaporator discharge will have no undesirable effect.<br>
[0187] A constant pressure valve, capillary tube or other suitable expansion means, may be<br>
used in place of the TEV, 30, if desired.<br>
[0188] Refrigerant receiver, 28, is preferred, offering modest performance improvement,<br>
but it is not essential, and may be eliminated if desired, slightly reducing manufacturing cost.<br>
Dryness Control<br>
[0189] Dryness may be monitored with classical electronic means that measure the<br>
electrical resistance of the fabric, via metallic fingers, that are mounted in the bulkhead or<br>
over insulated vanes. While this method works well, and has evolved into an industry<br>
standard, it does have its disadvantages. The placement of the metal strips is critical, else the<br>
wet clothes may not make the connection often enough to satisfy the sensor logic. In addition,<br>
it relies heavily on perfect tumbling of the clothes. If the clothes become wound up, as is<br>
common with large items such as sheets, or if a few pieces of clothing simply stay toward the<br>
back or front of the dryer, the metal strips may not sense individual wet items, and the dryer<br>
may stop short of appropriate dryness.<br>
[0190] In a preferred embodiment, the mixing ratio of drying air entering and exiting the<br>
drum may be monitored. When the mixing ratio difference across the drum is within a desired<br>
tolerance, such as 5 grams of water per kilogram of dry air, the run may be continued for a<br>
suitable dwell time, such as 5 minutes, and stopped. This 5 minute dwell accommodates<br>
fabric windup and/or hidden small items. If such is the case, these items intermittently<br>
separate during the 5 minute dwell, and the mixing ratio of the air leaving the drum briefly<br>
rises, restarting the dwell timer means. However, if after five minutes, there is no transient<br>
rise in the drum exhaust mixing ratio, the laundry is considered dry. This method has<br>
generally proved accurate to 0.2 pounds of bone dry (2.5 % of dry weight).<br>
Open Loop Air Circuit<br>
[0191] An alternative to the closed air loop embodiments discussed in previous sections of<br>
this document is shown in Figure 27. The blower, 12, may be located as shown, or may be<br>
located at the drum, 10, exhaust, point 3, to induce slight negative static pressure in the drum,<br>
as discussed in the section Drum Sealing.<br>
 [0192] In this embodiment, room air is drawn into the condenser, 26, at point 1, where it is<br>
heated. The heated room air exits the condenser, 26, enters the drum 10 at point 2, and<br>
extracts moisture from the fabric. The air then exits the drum 10 cooler and wetter, and enters<br>
the evaporator, 18, at point 3, which extracts heat from the air. The wet air leaves the<br>
evaporator, 18, at point 4, passes through the blower 12, to external vent means at point 5,<br>
where it is preferably vented to the outdoors.<br>
[0193] In this embodiment, the condenser, 26, performs the function of the heater in a<br>
conventional dryer, with substantially less power consumption, taking advantage of the heat<br>
pump COP. The evaporator, 18, does not condense all of the moisture in the drum exhaust. It<br>
removes sufficient heat for heating incoming room air at the condenser, 26. Moisture not<br>
condensed out is vented outdoors with the exhaust air. Subcooler, 44, and wet air heatsink,<br>
14, are not required, as heat substantially equal to the compressor, 16, power consumption is<br>
vented from the system with the exhaust air.<br>
[0194] In an alternate embodiment, the evaporator, 18, capacity may be sufficient to<br>
condense substantially all the moisture from the exhaust air, permitting the exhaust air to be<br>
vented into the room, and not requiring outdoor venting means. In this embodiment,<br>
subcooler, 44, may be used to removed heat substantially equivalent to the compressor, 16,<br>
power consumption. Exhaust air may be used to cool the subcooler, 44, eliminating the need<br>
for a separate subcooler, 44, fan or blower.<br>
[0195] In a variation of a fully condensing embodiment, wet air heatsink, 14, may be used,<br>
alone, or with subcooler, 44, to remove heat substantially equivalent to the compressor, 16,<br>
power consumption. In this embodiment, the evaporator, 18, capacity may be reduced, such<br>
that the combined heat transfer capacity of the heatsink, 14, and the evaporator, 18, is<br>
sufficient to remove sensible heat and condense substantially all the moisture in the exhaust<br>
air.<br>
[0196] An air to air economizer or heat pipe economizer may be employed, with hot<br>
section at the system exhaust, point 5, and cold section at the system intake, point 1, for<br>
improved efficiency.<br>
[0197] Refrigerant economizer, 50, may be applied to any of the above embodiments to<br>
improve heat pump performance.<br>
[0198] This embodiment draws room air, and like conventional dryers, it is unable to<br>
reduce the partial pressure of water vapor in the drying air, as discussed in Appendix A:<br>
Theoretical Considerations. It presents the following advantages and tradeoffs:<br>
Advantages<br>
Substantially Reduced Manufacturing Cost<br>
No Heat Pipe<br>
Subcooler Not Required<br>
Smaller Heat Pump<br>
Tradeoffs<br>
Drying Air Discharge<br>
Outdoor Vent Required for Most Venues<br>
Chemical Vapors In Exhaust<br>
Dryer Sheets<br>
Wash Additives<br>
Slower, Drying Time Commensurate With Conventional Dryers<br>
Additional Process Enhancements<br>
Warmup Heat Storage<br>
[0199] Warmup time and warmup energy consumption may be reduced by storing waste<br>
heat generated during operation. While the preferred media is a blend of paraffins and/or<br>
other waxes, this may be accomplished with any heat storage media of sufficient capacity,<br>
that is suitable for the operating temperature range.<br>
[0200] One embodiment is shown in Figure 15, in which a phase change heat exchanger,<br>
106, contains phase change media and suitable support structure, interposed in the wet air<br>
discharge from the drum, 10. Said support structure is configured to present sufficient surface<br>
area exposure of the media to the drum exhaust air, as well as maintain the form factor of the<br>
media while in the liquid state.<br>
[0201] While the dryer is at steady state operating temperature, the phase change media<br>
absorbs heat from the drum exhaust air, effectively performing the function of the wet air<br>
heatsink, 14. Air exiting the phase change heat exchanger, 106, is sufficiently cooled to limit<br>
the effectiveness of the heatsink, 14. This continues until the phase change media is<br>
substantially melted, and cannot absorb any more heat. At this point, the heatsink, 14<br>
performs its usual function of removing heat from the dryer for the remainder of the cycle.<br>
Heatsink, 14, may be shut down, preferably by control, 32, as discussed in previous sections<br>
of this document, until heat storage media becomes saturated.<br>
[0202] When the dryer is started for a subsequent drying cycle, if it is cold, or if it is not<br>
fully warmed up, the phase change heat exchanger, 106, will heat the drum exhaust air,<br>
contributing warmup heat to the dryer. When the media is fully frozen, and cannot supply any<br>
more heat, or if the dryer reaches proper temperature before this occurs, the media ceases to<br>
contribute heat, and the cycle continues normally. During the steady state period, the media is<br>
reheated.<br>
[0203] This approach shortens warmup time with no added energy consumption,<br>
effectively reducing drying time and energy consumption per load.<br>
[0204] An alternate embodiment employs heat storage media in the refrigerant circuit (not<br>
shown). In the preferred refrigerant circuit embodiment, the heat storage media is located<br>
between the condenser, 26, and subcooler, 44, at point 2'. In an alternative refrigerant circuit<br>
embodiment, the heat storage media may be integrated with the subcooler, 44, or may be<br>
located between subcooler, 44, and refrigerant economizer, 52, at point 3'.<br>
[0205] In this latter embodiment, the subcooler, 44, may be shut down, preferably by the<br>
system controls, until the heat storage media is saturated. The temperature of saturated heat<br>
storage media will lower than that of the preferred refrigerant circuit embodiment, concurrent<br>
with heat removed by the subcooler, 44, during steady state.<br>
[0206] In the preferred refrigerant circuit embodiment, phase change media absorbs heat<br>
from the refrigerant exiting the condenser, 26, cooling the refrigerant, and serving the<br>
function of subcooler, 44. While the media is absorbing heat, it cools the refrigerant<br>
sufficiently to limit the effectiveness of the subcooler, 44. When the phase change media<br>
becomes saturated, i.e. when it is fully melted, and can no longer absorb heat, the subcooler,<br>
44, performs its usual function of removing heat from the dryer for the remainder of the<br>
cycle. Subcooler, 44, may be shut down, preferably by control, 32, as discussed in previous<br>
sections of this document, until heat storage media becomes saturated.<br>
[0207] When the dryer is started for a subsequent drying cycle, if it is cold, or if it is not<br>
fully warmed up, the phase change media will heat the refrigerant entering the economizer,<br>
50, contributing warmup heat to the dryer. The economizer, 50, conducts this heat directly to<br>
the compressor suction, increasing suction gas density, and refrigerant mass flow. This<br>
compounds the effect of the phase change media; the heat pump operates at useful<br>
effectiveness before reaching operating temperature, further reducing warmup time.<br>
[0208] When the media is fully frozen, and cannot supply any more heat, or if the dryer<br>
reaches proper temperature before this occurs, the media ceases to contribute heat, and the<br>
cycle continues normally. This approach substantially shortens warmup time without added<br>
energy consumption, effectively reducing drying time and energy consumption per load.<br>
Active Expander<br>
[0209] To improve heat pump efficiency and further reduce drying energy consumption, as<br>
shown in Figure 11, this embodiment employs an active expander, 108, in place of the TEV.<br>
The expander, 108, serves the same function as the TEV, but instead of using irreversible<br>
friction as the source of pressure drop, reversibly extracts energy from the refrigerant. The<br>
preferred embodiment employs a small scroll type refrigerant compressor, operating in<br>
reverse as an expander, and generating useful electricity. A scroll type expander will<br>
advantageously tolerate internal vaporization of the refrigerant during expansion.<br>
[0210] This arrangement preserves the hermetic nature of the heat pump refrigerant circuit,<br>
and its concurrent design life and reliability. The electrical output from the expander may<br>
sent to electronic controls that provide steady controlled electrical supply, over a range of<br>
expander rotation speeds. The resultant clean electrical supply may be used to operate<br>
ancillary items, such as fan and/or drum motors, or may supply a portion of the compressor<br>
power, as desired.<br>
Advanced Refrigerant and Equipment for Using Same<br>
[0211] In the interest of entirely eliminating Hydrocarbons, Fluorines, and Chlorines from<br>
the heat pump, it is advantageous to use water as the refrigerant. A heat pump system<br>
intended for water based working fluid presents novel equipment design considerations,<br>
which offer manufacturing advantages, as well as zero ODP, and zero Global Warming.<br>
[0212] A heat pump system using water as the refrigerant will operate at substantially<br>
lower pressures and higher volume flow than with conventional refrigerants. Heat pump<br>
equipment designed for water based refrigerant will have commensurately different<br>
requirements.<br>
 [0213] Typical system pressures in a heat pump, operating in the preferred temperature<br>
range of a heat pump dryer, are less than ~1 PSIA on the low side, and ~10 PSIA on the high<br>
side. Refrigerant volume flow rates are substantially higher than with conventional systems.<br>
The compressor for the preferred embodiment is a hybrid design, resembling a high pressure<br>
blower as much as a conventional heat pump compressor.<br>
[0214] One embodiment of a suitable compressor is a rotary vane type, optimized to handle<br>
deep vacuum on the low side, and high differential pressure, as compared with typical rotary<br>
vane devices. An alternate embodiment comprises regenerative blower stages. Conventional<br>
regenerative blowers are not capable of sufficient differential pressure for use in a heat pump,<br>
and a modified design is necessary. One embodiment comprises a plurality of cascaded<br>
regenerative blower stages.<br>
[0215] The low pressure side of this system operates at a substantial vacuum with respect<br>
to ambient atmospheric pressure. To accommodate this, suitable means to prevent air from<br>
infiltrating the system through shaft seals, or the like, are needed. For this purpose, and for<br>
motor cooling, the compressor block is preferably encased in a hermetic shell, similar to<br>
conventional heat pump compressors.<br>
[0216] In conventional systems, refrigerant soluble lubricant is used in the compressor. A<br>
small amount invariably escapes the compressor through piston rings, scroll seals, or the like.<br>
The escaped lubricant is permitted to circulate throughout the refrigerant circuit, and<br>
eventually returns to the compressor at the suction side.<br>
[0217] One compressor embodiment, for use with water refrigerant, is an oilless type,<br>
requiring no lubricant. An alternate embodiment, which presents improved sealing and<br>
reduced blow by qualities, incorporates a water soluble lubricant that is permitted to circulate<br>
throughout the refrigerant circuit. The preferred lubricant will not materially compromise the<br>
thermodynamic properties of the water refrigerant.<br>
[0218] Water refrigerant introduces the possibility of corrosion. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the piping is nonmetallic, and piping corrosion is not an issue. Corrosion in the<br>
compressor may be addressed with a plurality of methods. One embodiment employs<br>
corrosion inhibitors in the soluble lubricant. An alternate method, which may be used with or<br>
without corrosion inhibitors, is the use of corrosion resistant materials or platings for the<br>
compressor wetted components.<br>
[0219] A third embodiment comprises oxygen getter means installed in the system piping.<br>
Such means remove entrained oxygen from the refrigerant during the first minutes or hours of<br>
run time, mitigating or eliminating corrosion in the compressor, piping, and in all system<br>
components that contact the refrigerant. The getter media may react with available oxygen,<br>
converting it to an inert compound that remains captivated in the media, may catalytically<br>
absorb it, or may use other suitable means for removing available oxygen from the system.<br>
[0220] In a preferred hermetic embodiment, the getter means may be an ablative single use<br>
type, that is substantially consumed in the oxygen removal process. The getter media may be<br>
packaged in a sealed canister that is installed during system manufacture, removes available<br>
oxygen upon first use, and becomes a permanent passive component, much like the<br>
filter/dryer used in conventional systems.<br>
[0221] The heat exchangers in this system will also depart from conventional heat pump<br>
HX design. In light of the low operating pressures, and high volumetric flowrates, classical<br>
small bore Fin and U Tube configurations will not perform properly. A preferred HX<br>
embodiment comprises comparatively large diameter inlet and exhaust ports manifolded to a<br>
substantial plurality of parallel flow tubes or channels. The low operating pressures will<br>
permit very inexpensive HX designs.<br>
[0222] The piping design will also be a departure from conventional systems. It will<br>
preferably be of larger diameter, and may be of lighter materials, such as aluminum, PVC, or<br>
other suitable polymer. In the preferred embodiment, PVC piping is used with solvent welded<br>
joints, offering substantially reduced manufacturing cost over conventional systems.<br>
[0223] Water refrigerant exhibits practical saturation pressures at temperatures typical of<br>
air conditioning systems, and heat pump equipment using water refrigerant may be used in air<br>
conditioning applications, as well as in the heat pump dryer.<br>
Supplemental Features<br>
Stationary Drum For Drying Nontumble Items Such As Sneakers<br>
[0224] Conventional dryers often provide a removable stationary rack for drying sneakers<br>
and the like. This rack attaches to the rear drum bulkhead, which typically does not rotate,<br>
and to the front door frame. It's only purpose is to provide a stationary platform for items that<br>
cannot be tumbled.<br>
[0225] The heat pump dryer has a separate drum or vane drive that may be stopped for<br>
drying items such as sneakers. If desired, a multilevel rack may be provided for drying large<br>
quantities of nontumble items. This rack may simply rest inside the drum without need for<br>
complex attachment means.<br>
 [0226] An alternate embodiment comprises a single or multilevel rack that captivates items<br>
to be dried, so the drum or vanes may rotate without causing these wet items to tumble or fall.<br>
In this embodiment, drum or vane rotation speed may be reduced to minimize the effects of<br>
unbalance while providing enhanced exposure of wet items to drying air. In a stationary drum<br>
embodiment, this type of rack may attach to the vanes, and rotate with them as an integral<br>
unit.<br>
Modular Heat Pump<br>
[0227] The heat pump system may be constructed as unitary module, permitting simplified<br>
removal for repair or replacement. A unitary module may also be advantageously connected<br>
to an existing conventional tumble dryer, thus converting it to a heat pump dryer. In the latter<br>
case, the module may be configured as a pedestal which the connected dryer sits upon.<br>
Heat Pump Dryer Sheets<br>
[0228] Dryer sheets, currently available from a number of vendors, contain a form of fabric<br>
softener that outgases during drying, and infiltrates the fabric. These sheets are designed for<br>
conventional dryers, and produce sufficient active vapor to maintain desired concentration, as<br>
the drum air is continually replaced with room air.<br>
[0229] The heat pump dryer does not dilute the air loop with room air, and dryer sheets<br>
need not produce the quantity of active vapor necessary for use with conventional dryers. A<br>
reduced vapor rate dryer sheet for use with heat pump dryers will exhibit performance<br>
commensurate with conventional dryer sheets used in conventional dryers, at substantially<br>
less cost.<br>
[0230] In an alternate embodiment, a suitable easily accessible holder may be provided in<br>
the heat pump dryer air loop, in which a longer life product may be placed. This product,<br>
preferably heat or moisture activated, may outgas active vapor at a slow rate, only during<br>
drying. It may be fabricated as a sponge, molded cake, or the like, and may be designed to<br>
last for any desirable number of drying cycles before being replaced. The holder may be<br>
located in the door, as part of the lint filter assembly, or any suitable location in the air loop.<br>
Heat Pump Hot Water Source<br>
 [0231] The heat pump hot water source will generate hot water from cold, or preheat a<br>
water heater feed stream. It may heat or preheat process water for any suitable process. It<br>
accomplishes this by recovering and storing heat, that would otherwise be wasted, from hot<br>
drain water, such as from a washer or washers. Heat storage is preferably accomplished with<br>
suitable phase change media, such as paraffin or eutectic salt, allowing sequential heat<br>
recovery and subsequent use; the heat source and the heated process need not operate<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0232] The heat pump preferably uses the stored heat to raise incoming wash water, such as<br>
cold tap water, to the proper wash temperature. The heat pump means may comprise a large<br>
central system that collects and stores heat from a plurality of washer drains, and heats wash<br>
water for a plurality of washers. In the preferred embodiment, the system is integrated in a<br>
single washer, or configured as a pedestal that is placed under an existing washer.<br>
Commercial washers are significantly shorter than their counterpart dryers, and the pedestal<br>
may raise the washer to a more convenient loading height.<br>
[0233] An example of the preferred embodiment is illustrated in Figure 28. In this<br>
embodiment, a heat pump, comprising compressor 16, condenser 110, economizer 50,<br>
receiver 28, TEV 30, and evaporator 112, is interposed between heat storage means, 114 and<br>
116. Heat storage means 114 and 116 may comprise any suitable heat storage media; the<br>
preferred heat storage embodiment comprises containers of suitable phase change media,<br>
such as a paraffin or eutectic salt, or suitable blend thereof. In the preferred embodiment, heat<br>
exchangers, 118 and 112, are integrated within the drain side heat storage media 114, and<br>
heat exchangers, 110 and 120, are integrated within the supply side heat storage media 116.<br>
[0234] When the washer, 124, calls for hot wash water, tap water enters the supply side<br>
heat storage means 116, at point 1, and passes through heat exchanger means 120, integrated<br>
within the heat storage media, which heats the tap water to desired wash temperature, as<br>
described below. Heated wash water exits the heat storage means 116, and enters the warmup<br>
heater, 34, at point 2. The wash water passes through warmup heater 34, and enters the<br>
washer 124, hot water inlet, at point 3. If there is insufficient heat stored for heating incoming<br>
cold wash water, such as during the first run of a cold start, the warmup heater 34, may be<br>
energized to heat the wash water.<br>
[0235] At the completion of the first or any subsequent wash cycles, the drain water leaving<br>
the washer 124, retains substantial heat. This drain water exits the washer 124, at point 4, and<br>
enters drain diverter valve 126. If drain water is sufficiently warm, it passes through the<br>
diverter valve 126, and enters drain side heat storage means 114, at point 7. The drain water<br>
then passes through heat exchanger means 118, integrated within the heat storage media.<br>
Heat exchanger means, 118 transfers heat from the drain water to heat storage media, and the<br>
cooled drain water exits to an external drain provision, at point 5.<br>
[0236] The heat storage media in heat storage means 114, retains the heat transferred from<br>
the drain water. In the preferred embodiment, this media is of the phase change type, such as<br>
a paraffin or eutectic salt, or suitable blend thereof. The heat storage media preferably has<br>
sufficient capacity to store the heat of one or more complete wash cycles.<br>
[0237] The heat pump transports the heat stored in the drain side heat storage means 114,<br>
via heat exchanger means 112, the refrigerant evaporator, to the supply side heat storage<br>
means 116, via heat exchanger means 120, the refrigerant condenser. The supply side heat<br>
storage media stores the pumped heat. The supply side heat storage media is preferably a<br>
phase change media, similar to the drain side media, with a melting point commensurate with<br>
wash temperature.<br>
[0238] When sufficient heat is stored in the supply side media for heating wash water, the<br>
warmup heater, 34 is no longer needed and may be shut off. Incoming cold tap water passes<br>
through heat exchanger means, 110, which transfers heat from the heat storage means, 116, to<br>
the incoming tap water. The tap water, thus heated to proper wash temperature, exits the<br>
supply side heat storage means, 116, at point 2, then passes through warmup heater, 34,<br>
unchanged if already at desired wash temperature, and enters the washer 124, hot water inlet,<br>
at point 3.<br>
[0239] The drain side water heat exchanger, 112 and storage means, 114, is preferably of<br>
sufficient heat transfer capacity to recover and store drain water heat in real time. Likewise,<br>
the supply side water heat exchanger, 120, and heat storage means, 116, is preferably of<br>
sufficient heat transfer capacity to heat incoming tap water to wash temperature in real time.<br>
[0240] The heat storage means are preferably insulated sufficiently to store heat for a<br>
period of time exceeding the maximum idle time of the washer, 124, for example, overnight.<br>
[0241] In the preferred embodiment, heat is stored on both the drain side and the supply<br>
side. This takes advantage of the fill and drain duty cycle, which is relatively low; each<br>
generally requiring approximately 5 minutes, and typically occurring at intervals of 15 to 20<br>
minutes.<br>
[0242] The heat pump is preferably of lower capacity than the heat storage means, and<br>
operates for a period exceeding the drain and fill times and less than the interval between fill<br>
cycles, as needed, to pump stored heat from the drain side to the supply side heat storage<br>
means. This advantageously permits the use of a smaller, less expensive heat pump, with no<br>
compromise in performance.<br>
[0243] Alternatively, heat storage media may be implemented only at the drain or fill side.<br>
In this embodiment, the heat pump is of sufficient capacity to pump heat either from the drain<br>
water or to the wash water in real time. This embodiment permits the use of heat storage<br>
means at either the drain or supply side and not at both, but requires a substantially larger and<br>
more expensive heat pump.<br>
[0244] In practice, it is common for the wash water to be hot, and the rinse water be warm<br>
or cold. It is disadvantageous for cold drain water to pass through the drain side heat storage<br>
means, 114. In the preferred embodiment, when the drain water temperature falls below a<br>
preset threshold, diverter valve, 126, is activated, causing drain water to bypass the heat<br>
storage means, 114, entirely, at point 4, and pass directly to an external drain provision, at<br>
point 6.<br>
[0245] As cold drain water generally follows a cold fill cycle, it is not necessary to heat the<br>
incoming tap water for same. In the aggregate, over a sufficient plurality of wash cycles,<br>
stored heat will generally be commensurate with needed heat.<br>
[0246] The washer, 124, tub or drum is preferably insulated, to minimize heat loss during<br>
the wash dwell time. Typical energy and operational cost reduction, when this system is used<br>
with a washer or a plurality of washers, is commensurate with that of the heat pump dryer.<br>
Appendix A: Theoretical Considerations<br>
Three States of Drying<br>
[0247] In convective drying, there are three discemable states in the transition from wet to<br>
dry fabric: Warmup or Rising Rate, Steady State, and Fatting Rate.<br>
[0248] Warmup is the first state of convective drying. In this state, the fabrics are at their<br>
highest moisture content, and the drying air is relatively dry. At this stage, the surface<br>
temperature of the fabric to be dried is lower than the wet bulb temperature of the drying air.<br>
This is the driving mechanism during warmup. The wet bulb temperature of the drying air<br>
must be reduced, and the surface temperature of the clothes must be increased. The drying air<br>
therefore transfers heat to the clothes, and the clothes transfer moisture to the air. This<br>
mechanism will stop when the equilibrium condition is met, i.e., when the surface<br>
temperature of the clothes equals the wet bulb temperature.<br>
[0249] During Steady State drying, the surface temperature of the clothes remains constant,<br>
as does the wet bulb temperature of the air. There is a stable transfer rate of moisture from the<br>
fabric to the air and the drum is effectively adiabatic during this time. The mechanism for<br>
drying in Steady State is the difference in partial pressures between water in the air/fabric<br>
boundary layer, and water in the bulk air (Discussed below in Low Temperature Drying<br>
Mechanism). Steady State continues while the core of the wet fabric has sufficient moisture<br>
to feed the surface at the same rate as the surface releases moisture to the air. However, at<br>
some point there will no longer be enough moisture in the core of the fabric to sustain this,<br>
and mass transfer will begin to slow the process down. This threshold is referred to as the<br>
Critical Moisture Content. The Critical Moisture Content varies with the size and shape of<br>
the laundry item, as well as the fabric itself.<br>
[0250] Falling Rate is the last and least efficient state of drying. In this state, there is<br>
insufficient moisture near the surface of the fabric to keep the partial pressure of water in the<br>
air/fabric boundary layer constant. As this partial pressure decreases, the driving force behind<br>
drying is reduced. Mass transfer is therefore the bottleneck during this state, as the drying air<br>
can remove only the moisture on the surface. Mass transfer is the movement of moisture<br>
through the fabric from the core to the surface, and is governed by two variables; the fabric<br>
itself, and its internal energy. The fabric cannot be changed, so the only variable that can be<br>
used to increase the driving force for drying is the internal energy of the clothes. It is<br>
relatively difficult to transfer heat via convection during this state, and the drying rate<br>
therefore falls continuously until it becomes asymptotic. This is the practical limit for<br>
convection drying.<br>
Low Temperature Drying Mechanism<br>
"Equilibrium Moisture Content<br>
In drying of solids, it is important to distinguish between hygroscopic and<br>
non-hygroscopic materials. If a hygroscopic material is maintained in contact<br>
with air at constant temperature and humidity until equilibrium is reached, the<br>
material will attain a definite moisture content. This moisture is termed the<br>
equilibrium moisture content for the specified conditions. Equilibrium<br>
moisture may be absorbed as a surface film or condensed in the fine<br>
capillaries of the solid at reduced pressure, and its concentration will vary<br>
with the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air. However, at low<br>
temperatures, e.g., 60° F to 12(f F, a plot of equilibrium moisture content vs<br>
per cent relative humidity is essentially independent of temperature. At zero<br>
humidity the equilibrium moisture content of all materials is zero." (Perry &amp;<br>
Chilton, Chemical Engineers' Handbook, Fifth Edition: 20-12. McGraw-Hill,<br>
1973)<br>
[0251] The above excerpt illustrates the theory behind drying clothes at relatively low<br>
temperatures. The mechanism for this drying is not the boiling of water, but rather the<br>
tendency of two bodies, with differing moisture content, to reach equilibrium. This is the<br>
same mechanism that dries the skin in cold weather. It is driven by the difference between the<br>
partial pressures of water vapor in the drying medium (in this case, air) and on the surface of<br>
the moist fabric.<br>
[0252] The surface of the clothes during steady state drying is always at the wet bulb<br>
temperature of the surrounding air (the core of the fabric will be measurably colder than the<br>
surface). At the boundary layer between the clothes and the air, the temperature of both the<br>
clothes and the surrounding film of air will therefore be the wet bulb temperature. Since the<br>
clothes are wet, the surrounding film of air will be saturated (100% RH). There is a specific<br>
and known partial pressure of water vapor in this film of air which corresponds to 100% RH<br>
at the temperature of the boundary layer. The relative humidity of the bulk drying air is not<br>
100%, it is in fact much lower. This corresponds to a lower partial pressure of water vapor in<br>
the bulk air.<br>
[0253] This difference in partial pressures causes the water vapor in the boundary layer to<br>
migrate into the bulk air. This loss of water vapor is immediately replenished by the surface<br>
of the clothes, drying the clothes and remoistening the boundary layer air. This mechanism<br>
relates to a drying rate in the following equation:<br>
Drying Rate = ht 'A  Ap<br>
[0254] In this equation, ht is the total heat transfer coefficient between the moist fabric and<br>
the convective drying medium (in this case, air). A is the total aggregate surface area of the<br>
moist fabric exposed to the drying medium. A is dependent on the size of the load, the size of<br>
the drying drum, and the speed at which the drum spins. Ap is the partial pressure difference<br>
discussed earlier.<br>
[0255] This equation shows that for a given load of laundry in a drum of a given size, the<br>
only variable that directly controls drying rate is the difference in partial pressures (Ap).<br>
There are two ways of increasing Ap, and therefore the drying rate; increasing the saturated<br>
partial pressure of water vapor at the boundary layer, or decreasing the partial pressure of<br>
water vapor in the bulk air.<br>
[0256] A conventional dryer is incapable of decreasing the partial pressure of water vapor<br>
in the bulk air, because it draws room air, and the partial pressure of water vapor in air does<br>
not measurably change with the dry bulb temperature. Instead, a conventional dryer uses heat<br>
to increase the surface temperature of the clothes, which in turn increases the partial pressure<br>
of water vapor at the boundary layer.<br>
[0257] The heat pump dryer partially uses heat in the same manner, however it also uses<br>
the evaporator coil to reduce the overall moisture content of the bulk air that enters the drum.<br>
This combined capability of reducing the partial pressure of water in the bulk air and<br>
increasing the partial pressure of the water in the boundary layer allows the heat pump dryer<br>
to dry faster at lower drum inlet temperatures.<br>
Standby Moisture Handling<br>
[0258] During long down times, the moisture in the drying air loop may become stale, and<br>
may support bacterial growth. This may be treated in a variety of ways as outlined below.<br>
The treatment ways may be used individually or in combination with each other.<br>
1: Drying out the dryer<br>
[0259] A: Active System, using one or two very small fans, perhaps 20 watts each. These<br>
may be configured to purge the drying air loop between runs. One fan and a vent or one<br>
suction fan and one discharge fan may be used. They may be very low airflow, as there is no<br>
need to purge quickly. They may cycle briefly after each run, or may be programmed to cycle<br>
after a predetermined period of idle time.<br>
[0260] FIG. 39 illustrates such an active system. As shown therein, an input purge fan<br>
1060 may be used to provide air to the drying air loop. The output of the fan 1060 may be<br>
connected to the drying air loop via a check valve or damper 1062. The system may also<br>
include an exhaust purge fan 1064 that is connected to the drying air loop via a check valve<br>
or damper 1066.<br>
[0261] The discharge vent for this approach may be active, either solenoid or motor<br>
operated. It may also be a simple one way shutter, similar in construction to venetion blinds.<br>
If placed at the main blower suction, and biased to close when the main blower is running, it<br>
will close during normal dryer operation. When he purge fan is running, it will open to allow<br>
purge air to exit. The entire configuration may be reversed, with the damper on the main<br>
blower discharge, allowing air to enter only, and the purge fan exhausting air.<br>
[0262] B: Passive System. Humidity sensitive semiporous membrane material, such as<br>
those made by Mitsubishi, and used in refrigerator crisper drawers, may be used in the drying<br>
air loop. If desired, two ports may be created to permit cross flow through the drying air loop.<br>
The ports may be located at a point of relatively low pressure relative to the room ambient to<br>
mitigate stress on the membrane.<br>
[0263] Referring now to FIG. 39, in a preferred embodiment, a membrane 1068 may be<br>
placed at a dry section of the drying air loop, such as the drum inlet. The membrane 1068<br>
will then close in response to the humidity. When the dryer is idle, and the humidity in the<br>
loop equalizes, the membrane 1068 will open, permitting slow migration of moisture out of<br>
the loop. Alternatively, one membrane 1068, and one small purge fan 1064 may be used.<br>
2: Antibacterial<br>
[0264] A: Ultraviolet Lamps in the evaporator section will greatly mitigate bacterial growth<br>
in the loop, and will help freshen the clothes. Small diameter fluorescent UV lamps placed<br>
across the evaporator so the light penetrates the space between the fins will be very effective.<br>
FIG. 39 illustrates a plurality of ultraviolet light sources 1070 placed adjacent a self cleaning<br>
lint trapping evaporator 18.<br>
[0265] B: Ozone Generator means may also be used to retard bacterial growth and render<br>
the clothing smelling very fresh. This may run during idle time and/or during drying time. It<br>
may be desirable to have a two power setting, so the ozinator runs at low power during idle,<br>
and higher power during drying.<br>
[0266] C: Dryer Sheets: The closed loop system requires less treatment vapor, and less<br>
than 54 of a standard sheet seems to provide very good results, and leaves the dryer smelling<br>
nice for at least a day or two.<br>
D: Integrated Lint Filter &amp; Dryer Sheet<br>
[0267] A lint filter fabricated of very small pore open cell foam, or corrugated paper based<br>
media may be treated with fabric softener chemistry similar to that used in disposable dryer<br>
sheets. The filter may be mounted in a suitable disposable or reusable frame, that fits specific<br>
models of dryer and replaces the existing lint filter. The filter may be of sufficient surface<br>
area (eg via corrugations) so as to permit running a plurality of loads before discarding it.<br>
[0268] In a heat pump dryer, because much less lint is generated, and the closed loop<br>
configuration of the heat pump dryer consumes less softener chemistry, facilitating the use of<br>
the filter/softener embodiment for numerous loads. This type of filter in a heat pump dryer<br>
may have a design life 10 or more loads, permitting nominal weekly replacement.<br>
Integrated Self Cleaning Lint Removal<br>
[0269] Dryer design to date has sought to prevent lint from reaching the evaporator. Lint<br>
will tend to stick to the wet evaporator surfaces and ultimately occlude it. However, as a<br>
relatively small amount of lint is produced by this dryer, the evaporator might be designed to<br>
attract lint, eliminating the need for a lint filter entirely. FIG. 36 illustrates such an<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0270] The evaporator 18 may have a plurality of fins (not shown) spaced sufficiently to<br>
allow modest lint buildup on the fins without compromising airflow. Convoluted fins will<br>
tend to attract more lint than flat fins. Some portion of the lint will wash down with the<br>
condensate that drips into the collection tray 20.<br>
[0271] The evaporator 18 may be self cleaning. As shown in FIG. 36, a spray or wash of<br>
condensate water from the sump 22 may be pumped by a lint flush pump 1020 over the<br>
evaporator fins, washing all remaining lint into the condensate tray 20. Lint may then be<br>
pumped out of the dryer by drain pump 1022 with the condensate drain discharge. This<br>
washdown may be done at the conclusion of each drying cycle, or at programmed intervals<br>
during drying. For example, a lint flush control 1024 may be provided. It may be advantages<br>
to circulate washdown water continuously during drying; the impact of this on condensing<br>
performance must be evaluated.<br>
[0272] Further, a self cleaning lint trap 1026 may be provided in the air pathway. The trap<br>
1026 may positioned between the blower 12 and the evaporator 18, which evaporator may be<br>
self-cleaning if desired. Water from the sump 22 may be provided to the lint trap 1026 by the<br>
pump 1020. Water containing lint may be collected by the tray 1028 and drained to the sump<br>
22.<br>
[0273] Moderate water pressure may be used to facilitate lint removal from the fins,<br>
however a high volume flush will likely yield better results. Proper manifold design with at<br>
least one discharge nozzle between each pair of fins, combined with fin design, will<br>
thoroughly flush the interfin gaps. A larger sump that holds sufficient water for washdown<br>
may be desired.<br>
[0274] The manifold may be a single pass across the top of the evaporator, or may employ<br>
a plurality of passes across the evaporator at several heights. It may be constructed of an<br>
additional tubing circuit, similar to the refrigerant circuits, perforated between the fins. If<br>
numerous small perforations are used, such that a plurality occurs in each gap between fins, it<br>
will not be necessary to precisely align the perforations between the fins. This will permit<br>
integrating the washdown circuit into the evaporator during its manufacture.<br>
[0275] The addition of an additional tubing circuit for washdown will render the overall<br>
evaporator 18 slightly larger. This will provide slightly increase fin surface and proper<br>
effectiveness with moderate lint loading.<br>
[0276] This function may be achieved with a condensate diverter valve that selects either<br>
the condensate drain hose, or the washdown nozzles. However, it is simpler, more reliable,<br>
and likely of similar cost to simply use two pumps in the sump, one for drain discharge, and<br>
the other for evaporator washdown. This also permits optimization of each pump for its<br>
specific purpose.<br>
[0277] The heat pipe assembly may also tend to get wet, and/or attract lint, and may need<br>
to be washed down as well.<br>
JFins<br>
[0278] As shown in FIG. 37, interdigitated J fins 1030 may be used in a dedicated prefilter<br>
design. Each pair of adjacent J fins 1030 has a flush water spray nozzle 1034 which is<br>
provided with lint filter flush water via line 1032. Drying loop air 1034 passes between<br>
adjacent ones of the J fins 1030. Water is collected in the tray 1036 and drained to the sump<br>
22. This design takes advantage of the velocity inertia of the lint particles, which will not<br>
negotiate the J turns and will tend to impinge on the fins. This might be done in an evaporator<br>
design, but as higher fin density is needed for proper evaporator capacity than is needed for<br>
lint trapping, a J fin evaporator may impose an undesirable air pressure drop.<br>
Porous Fins<br>
[0279] Hollow porous fins, fabricated of sintered microporous material or microperforated<br>
sheet may offer an effective wet down approach. Washdown water is fed to the hollow<br>
plenum formed by each fin, at moderate pressure, and oozes through the pores, maintaining a<br>
wet external surface, and good drainage downflow. This offers the advantage of completely<br>
wetted trap surfaces, and even wetting. This will help prevent lint from sticking to unwetted<br>
fin surface, and resisting removal. It will also likely require less washdown volume flow.<br>
[0280] Although it is a bit complex, porous fins might also be applied directly to an<br>
evaporator.<br>
Spray or Fog<br>
[0281] This method will tend to humidify the drum exhaust air. This air is already quite<br>
wet, and the humidification effect of spray or fog may not be significant.<br>
[0282] Spray, and to a greater extent fog, will trap lint in the air stream, but provision must<br>
be made to drive the lint ladent spray/fog to drain properly, and not carry lint in the airstream<br>
to the evaporator.<br>
[0283] A spray or fog in combination with J fins, immediately downstream of the spray/fog<br>
source, may work well. It may be desirable to chill the J fins. This can be done with the<br>
refrigerant circuit, and will simply precool the air, without adding additional heat pump work.<br>
[0284] It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention<br>
a heat pump clothes dryer which fully satisfies the objects, means, and advantages set forth<br>
