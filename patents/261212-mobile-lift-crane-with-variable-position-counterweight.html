MOBILE LIFT CRANE WITH VARIABLE POSITION COUNTERWEIGHT<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]      The present application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of Provisional U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/863,265, filed October 27, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]      The present application relates to lift cranes, and particularly to mobile lift cranes having a counterweight that can be moved to different positions in an effort to balance a load on the crane.<br>
[0003]      Lift cranes typically include counterweights to help balance the crane when the crane lifts a load. Sometimes the counterweight on the rear of the crane is so large that the carbody is also equipped with counterweight to prevent backward tipping when no load is being lifted. Further, an extra counterweight attachment, such as a counterweight trailer, is sometimes added to the crane to further enhance the lift capacities of the mobile lift crane. Since the load is often moved in and out with respect to the center of rotation of the crane, and thus generates different moments throughout a crane pick, move and set operation, it is advantageous if the counterweight, including any extra counterweight attachments, can also be moved forward and backward with respect to the center of rotation of the crane. In this way a smaller amount of counterweight can be utilized than would be necessary if the counterweight had to be kept at a fixed distance. [0004]      Since the crane needs to be mobile, any extra counterweight attachments also need to be mobile. However, when there is no load on the hook, it is customary to support these extra counterweights on the ground apart from the main crane; otherwise they would generate such a moment that the crane would tip backward. Thus, if the crane needs to move without a load on the hook, the extra counterweight attachment also has to be able to travel over the ground. This means that the ground has to be prepared and cleared, and often timbers put in place, for swing or travel of the extra counterweight unit.<br><br>
[0005]      A typical example of the forgoing is a Terex Demag CC8800 crane with a Superlift attachment. This crane includes 100 metric tonne of carbody counterweight, 280 metric tonne of crane counterweight, and 640 metric tonne on an extra counterweight attachment, for a total of 1020 metric tonne of counterweight. The extra counterweight can be moved in and out by a telescoping member. This crane has a maximum rated load moment of 23,500 metric tonne-meters. Thus the ratio of maximum rated load moment to total weight of the counterweight is only 23.04.<br>
[0006]      While all of this counterweight makes it possible to lift heavy loads, the counterweight has to be transported whenever the crane is dismantled for moving to a new job site. With U.S. highway constraints, it takes 15 trucks to transport 300 metric tonne of counterweight. Thus there is a need for further improvements in mobile lift cranes, where the same large loads can be lifted using less total crane counterweight.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0007]      A mobile lift crane and method of operation has been invented which use a reduced amount of total counterweight, but wherein the crane is still mobile and can lift loads comparable to a crane using significantly more total counterweight. In a first aspect, the invention is a mobile lift crane comprising a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed; a mast mounted at its first end on the rotating bed; a backhitch connected between the mast and a rear portion of the rotating bed; a moveable counterweight unit; at least one hydraulic cylinder; and at least one arm pivotally connected at a first end to the rotating bed and at a second end to the hydraulic cylinder. The arm and hydraulic cylinder are connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that extension and retraction of the hydraulic cylinder changes the position of the counterweight unit compared to the rotating bed.<br><br>
[0008]      In a second aspect, the invention is a mobile lift crane comprising a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed; a mast mounted at its first end on the rotating bed at a fixed angle compared to the plane of rotation of the rotating bed; a moveable counterweight unit suspended from a tension member connected at second end of the mast; and a counterweight movement structure connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that the counterweight unit may be moved to and held at a position in front of the top of the mast and moved to and held at a position rearward of the top of the mast.<br>
[0009]      A third aspect of the invention is a mobile lift crane comprising a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected about an axis of rotation to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed; a mast mounted at its first end on the rotating bed; a moveable counterweight unit; and a counterweight movement structure connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that the counterweight unit may be moved to and held at both a forward position and a rearward position; wherein the crane has a total amount of counterweight of at least 250 metric tonne and a maximum rated load moment of at least 6,250 metric tonne-meters, and the ratio of the maximum rated load moment to the total weight of all of the counterweight on the crane is at least 25.<br>
[0010]      A fourth aspect of the invention is a method of operating a mobile lift crane. The lift crane comprises a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed, with a hoist line extending therefrom; a mast mounted at its first end on the rotating bed; and a moveable counterweight unit. The method comprises the steps of positioning the counterweight forward of a point directly below the top of the mast when no load<br><br>
is on the hook; and positioning the counterweight reward of the top of the mast when the hoist line is supporting a load; wherein the moveable counterweight is never supported by the ground during crane pick, move and set operations other than indirectly by the ground engaging members on the carbody, [0011]      In a fifth aspect, the invention is a method of operating a mobile lift crane. The lift crane comprises a carbody having moveable ground engaging members; a rotating bed rotatably connected to the carbody such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members; a boom pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed, with a hoist line extending therefrom; a mast mounted at its first end on the rotating bed; at least one hydraulic cylinder; and a moveable counterweight unit. The method comprises the step of performing a pick, move and set operation with a load wherein the moveable counterweight is moved toward and away from the front portion of the rotating bed by extending and retracting the hydraulic cylinder during the pick, move and set operation to help counterbalance the load, but wherein the counterweight is never supported by the ground other than indirectly by the ground engaging members on the carbody.<br>
[0012]      With one embodiment of the lift crane of the present invention, a single large counterweight can be positioned far forward such that it produces very little backward moment on the crane when no load is on the hook. As a result, the carbody need not have extra counterweight attached to it. This large counterweight can be positioned far backward so that it can counterbalance a heavy load. Thus a 700 metric tonne counterweight can be used as the only counterweight on the crane, and the crane can still lift loads equivalent to those of the Terex Demag CC8800 Superlift with 1020 metric tonne of counterweight. Another advantage of the preferred embodiment of the invention is that the counterweight need not be set on the ground when the crane sets its load. There is no extra counterweight unit requiring a trailer, and the limitations of having to prepare the ground for such a trailer.<br>
[0013]      These and other advantages of the invention, as well as the invention itself, will be more easily understood in view of the attached drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0028]      The present invention will now befurther described. In the following passages, different aspects of the invention are defined in more detail. Each aspect so defined may be combined with any other aspect or aspects unless clearly indicated to the contrary. In particular, any feature indicated as being preferred or advantageous may be combined with any other feature or features indicated as being preferred or advantageous.<br>
[0029]      Several terms used in the specification and claims have a meaning defmed as follows.<br>
[0030]      The front of the rotating bed is defined as the portion of the rotating bed that is between the axis of rotation of the rotating bed and the position of the load when a load is being lifted. The rear portion of the rotating bed includes everything opposite the axis of rotation from the front of the rotating bed. The terms "front" and "rear" (or modifications thereof such as "rearward") referring to other parts of the rotating bed, or things connected thereto, such as the mast, are taken from this same context, regardless of the actual position of the rotating bed with respect to the ground engaging members.<br>
[0031]      The position of the counterweight unit is defmed as the center of gravity of the combination of all counterweight elements and any holding tray to which the counterweights are attached, or otherwise move in conjunction with. All counterweight units on a crane that are tied together so as to always move simultaneously are treated as a single counterweight for purposes of determining the center of gravity.<br>
[0032]      The top of the mast is defined as the furthest back position on the mast from which any line or tension member supported from the mast is suspended. If no line or tension member is supported from the mast, then the top of the mast is the position to which any backhitch is attached.<br>
[0033]      The moveable ground engaging members are defmed as members that are designed to remain engaged with the ground while the crane moves over the ground, such as tires or crawlers, but does not include ground engaging members<br><br>
that are designed to be stationary with respect to the ground, or be lifted from contact with the ground when they are moved, such as a ring on a ring supported crane.<br>
[0034]      The term "move" when referring to a crane operation includes movement of the crane with respect to the ground. This can be either a travel operation, where the crane traverses a distance over the ground on its ground engaging members, a swing operation, in which the rotating bed rotates with respect to the ground, or combinations of travel and swing operations. [0035]      Six embodiments of the invention are shown in the attached drawings. In the first embodiment, shown in Figures 1-5, the mobile lift crane 10 includes lower works, also referred to as a carbody 12, and moveable ground engaging members in the form of crawlers 14 and 16. (There are of course two front crawlers 14 and two rear crawlers 16, only one each of which can be seen from the side view of Figure 1. The other set of crawlers can be seen in the top view of Figure 4.) (Figures 4 and 5 are simplified for sake of clarity, and do not show the boom, mast, and backhitch.) In the crane 10, the ground engaging members could be just one set of crawlers, one crawler on each side. Of course additional crawlers than those shown, or other ground engaging members such as tires, can be used.<br>
[0036]      A rotating bed 20 is rotatably connected to the carbody 12 such that the rotating bed can swing with respect to the ground engaging members. The rotating bed is mounted to the carbody 12 with a slewing ring, such that the rotating bed 20 can swing about an axis with respect to the ground engaging members 14,16. The rotating bed supports a boom 22 pivotally mounted on a front portion of the rotating bed; a mast 28 mounted at its first end on the rotating bed; a backhitch 30 connected between the mast and a rear portion of the rotating bed; and a moveable counterweight unit having counterweights 34 on a support member 33. The counterweights may be in the form of multiple stacks of individual counterweight members on the support member 33 as shown in Figure 5.<br><br>
[0037]      Boom hoist rigging 25 between the top of mast 28 and boom 22 is used to control the boom angle and transfers load so that the counterweight can be used to balance a load lifted by the crane. A hoist line 24 extends from the boom 22, supporting a hook 26. The rotating bed 20 may also includes other elements commonly found on a mobile lift crane, such as an operator's cab and hoist drums for the rigging 25 and hoist line 24. If desired, the boom 22 may comprise a luffing jib pivotally mounted to the top of the main boom, or other boom configurations. The backhitch 30 is connected adjacent the top of the mast 28. The backhitch 30 may comprise a lattice member designed to carry both compression and tension loads as shown in Figure 1. In the crane 10, the mast is held at a fixed angle with respect to the rotating bed during crane operations, such as a pick, move and set operation.<br>
[0038]      The counterweight unit is moveable with respect to the rest of the rotating bed 20. A tension member 32 connected adjacent the top of the mast supports the counterweight unit in a suspended mode. A counterweight movement structure is connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that the counterweight unit may be moved to and held at a first position in front of the top of the mast, and moved to and held at a second position rearward of the top of the mast. At least one hydraulic cylinder 38 and at least one arm pivotally connected at a first end to the rotating bed and at a second end to the hydraulic cylinder are used in the counterweight movement structure of crane 10 to change the position of the counterweight. The arm and hydraulic cylinder 38 are connected between the rotating bed and the counterweight unit such that extension and retraction of the hydraulic cylinder changes the position of the counterweight unit compared to the rotating bed.<br>
[0039]      In the crane 10, the at least one arm preferably comprises a pivot frame 40 and a rear arm 36. (As with the crawlers, the rear arm 36 actually has both left and right members (Figures 4 and 5), only one of which can be seen in Figure 1, and the hydraulic cylinder comprises two cylinders that move in tandem. However, the following discussion only refers to one cylinder 38 and one arm 36 for sake of simplicity.) The pivot frame 40 is connected between the rotating bed<br><br>
20 and hydraulic cylinder 38, and the rear arm 36 is connected between the pivot frame 40 and the counterweight unit. A trunion 37 is used to connect the rear arm 36 and pivot frame 40. The hydraulic cylinder 38 is pivotally connected to the rotating bed 20 on a support frame 42 which elevates the hydraulic cylinder 38 to a point so that the geometry of the cylinder 38, pivot frame 40 and rear arm 36 can move the counterweight through its entire range of motion. In this manner the cylinder 38 causes the rear arm 36 to move the counterweight unit when the cylinder is retracted and extended.<br>
[0040]      While Figure 1 shows the counterweight unit in its most forward position. Figure 2 shows the hydraulic cylinder 38 partially extended, which moves the counterweight unit to a mid position, such as when a first load 29 is suspended from the hook 26. Figures 3 and 4 show the cylinder 38 fully extended, which moves the counterweight unit to its most rearward position, such as when a larger load 31 is suspended from the hook, or the boom is pivoted forward to extend the load further from the rotating bed. Thus, in the method of operation of crane 10, the counterweight is positioned forward of a point directly below the top of the mast when no load is on the hoist line; and the counterweight is positioned reward of the top of the mast when the hoist line supports a load. (The phrase "no load" on the hoist line is used in its common meaning of no extra lifted load. Of course the hook and any associated hook block may have a significant weight and apply tension to the hoist line even when no load is on the hoist line.) [0041]      As noted earlier, with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the moveable counterweight is never supported by the ground during crane operations. The crane can performing a pick, move and set operation with a load wherein the moveable counterweight is moved toward and away from the front portion of the rotating bed by extending and retracting the hydraulic cylinder during the operation to help counterbalance the load, but the counterweight is never supported by the ground other than indirectly by the ground engaging members on the carbody. Further, the single moveable counterweight unit is the only fimctional counterweight on the crane. The carbody is not provided with any separate functional counterweight. The fact that the counterweight unit can be<br><br>
moved very near to the centerline of rotation of the crane means that the counterweight does not produce a large backward tipping moment in that configuration, which would otherwise require the carbody to carry additional counterweight. (The phrase "not provided with any separate functional counterweight" is meant to differentiate prior art cranes where the carbody is specifically designed to include significant amounts of counterweight used to prevent backward tipping of the crane.)<br>
[0042]      Figure 6 shows a second embodiment of a crane 110 of the present invention. Like the crane 10, crane 110 includes a carbody 112, crawlers 114 and 116, a rotating bed 120, boom 122, boom hoist rigging 125, a load hoist line 124, a hook 126, a mast 128, a backhitch 130, a tension member 132 and a counterweight unit 134. The primary difference between the crane 110 compared to crane 10 is the configuration of the cylinder and arm used to move the counterweight unit. In crane 110 there are two hydraulic cylinders 136 and 138. Like cylinder 38, cylinder 138 is pivotally connected to the rotating bed 120. Also, arm 140 is pivotally connected at one end to the rotating bed and at its other end to the cylinder 138. However, in this embodiment the second hydraulic cylinder 136 is connected between the arm and the counterweight unit, as the rear arm 36 was in crane 10. The counterweight unit can be moved between a far forward position, when both hydraulic cylinders are retracted, to mid and far rearward positions (shown in phantom lines) when, respectively, the rear cylinder 136 is extended, and when both cylinders are fully extended.<br>
[0043]      Figure 7 shows a third embodiment of a crane 210. Like the cranes 10 and 110, crane 210 includes a carbody 212, crawlers 214, a rotating bed 220, boom 222, boom hoist rigging 225, a load hoist line 224, a hook 226, a mast 228, a backhitch 230, a tension member 232 and a counterweight unit 234. This crane is different than cranes 10 and 110 in that it has a second counterweight unit 237 which is supported directly on the rotating bed. Also, instead of having an arm and a hydraulic cylinder to move the counterweight unit 234, it has only one hydraulic cylinder 236. Further, the cylinder 236 is only indirectly connected to the rotating bed, as it is connected to the second counterweight unit which is<br><br>
supported on the rotating bed. In this fashion, when the second counterweight unit 237 is moved forward and backward, the counterweight unit 234 is also moved, The hydraulic cylinder 236 can be extended to move the counterweight 234 even further away from the centerline of rotation of the rotating bed, as shown in phantom lines.<br>
[0044]      Figure 8 shows a fourth embodiment of a crane 310 of the present invention. Like the crane 10, crane 310 includes a carbody 312, crawlers 314, rotating bed 320, boom 322, boom hoist rigging 325, a load hoist line 324, a hook 326, a mast 328, a backhitch 330, a tension member 332 and a counterweight 334. The primary difference between the crane 310 compared to crane 10 is that only the hydraulic cylinder 336 is used to move the counterweight unit, and no pivoting arm is employed. Like cylinder 38, cylinder 336 is pivotally connected to the rotating bed 320. However, in this embodiment the hydraulic cylinder 336 is connected to the counterweight unit, in this case indirectly by being connected to tension member 332. The counterweight unit can be moved between a far forward position (shown in phantom lines) when the hydraulic cylinder 336 is fully extended in one direction. The counterweight is moved to a mid position by retracting the cylinder 336. The counterweight is moved into a far rearward position when the cylinder 336 is again fiilly extended. [0045]      Figure 9 shows a fifth embodiment of a crane 410 of the present invention. Like crane 10, crane 410 includes a carbody 412, crawlers 414 and 416, a rotating bed 420, boom 422, boom hoist riggmg 425, a load hoist line 424, a hook 426, a mast 428, a backhitch 430, a tension member 432 and a coimterweight unit 434. The primary difference between the crane 410 compared to crane 10 is the configuration of the cylinder and arms used to move the counterweight unit, and the fact that the counterweight is moved backward by retracting the cylinder. In crane 410 the hydraulic cylinder 436 is pivotally connected to the rotating bed, but at a point behind where the arm 438 connects to the rotating bed. Arm 438 is pivotally connected at one end to the rotating bed and at its other end to the cylinder 436. A second arm 440 is connected between the arm 438 and the counterweight unit 434, as the rear arm 36 was in crane 10. The counterweight<br><br>
unit can be moved between a far forward position, when the hydraulic cylinder 436 is fully extended, to a far rearward position (shown in phantom lines) when the cylinder 436 is fully retracted.<br>
[0046]      Figures 10-14 show a sixth embodiment of a crane 510 of the present invention. Like crane 10, crane 510 includes a carbody 512, crawlers 514 and 516, a rotating bed 520, boom 522, boom hoist rigging 525, a load hoist line 524, a hook 526, a mast 528, a backhitch 530, a tension member 532 and a counterweight unit 534. The primary difference between the crane 510 compared to crane 10 is the configuration and placement of the backhitch, and the geometry of the arms 538. Arms 538 are not straight like arms 38 of crane 10, but rather have an angled portion 539 at the end that connects to the pivot frame 540, This allows the arms 538 to connect directly in line with the side members 541 of pivot frame 540, compared to connecting to the outside of the pivot frame 40 as in Figure 4, The angled portion 539 prevents the arms 538 from interfering with the side members 541 of the pivot frame the when the counterweight is in the position shown in solid lines in Figure 10.<br>
[0047]      In crane 510 the rotating bed is shortened, and hence the point on the rotating bed where the backhitch 530 is connected is forward of the point where the mast and backhitch connect, which causes the backhitch to be at an angle from the axis of rotation of the rotatmg bed. This angle may be between about 10° and about 20°. The preferred angle is about 16°, Further, while the backhitch 530 and tension member 532 are not connected at the very top of the mast 528, they are both still connected adjacent the top of the mast,<br>
[0048]      Also, as best seen in Figure 11, the backhitch 530 has an A-frame configuration, with two spaced apart legs 542 and 544 and a central upstanding member 546. (In Figure 11, the arms 538, cylinders 536 and counterweight unit 534 are not shown for sake of clarity.) The lattice connections 552 of the upstanding member 546 are shown in Figure 12. The lattice connections 554 of the legs 542 and 544 are shown in Figure 13. Figure 14 shows the lattice connections 556 used to construct the pivot frame 540.<br><br>
[0049]      The legs 542 and 544 are spaced apart so that arms 538 and pivot frame 540 can fit between legs 542 and 544 of the backhitch 530 as the counterweight 534 swings outwardly. In the crane 10, the top lattice member of the pivot frame 40 is spaced down low enough so that when the pivot frame 40 is in the position seen in Figure 3, the ends of the pivot fi^me can straddle the connection of the backhitch 30 to the rotating bed 20 without the lattice work of the pivot frame 40 contacting the backhitch. The counterweight unit 534 can be moved between a far forward position, when the hydraulic cylinder 536 is frilly retracted, to a far rearward position (shown in phantom lines) when the cylinder 536 is fully extended. The A-frame structure permits the backhitch to be connected up closer to the centerline of rotation without interfering with the movement of the pivot frame 540 and arms 538. Having the backhitch connect at this closer position allows for the rotating bed to be shortened compared to crane 10, [0050]      With the preferred embodiments of the invention, the counterweight unit is supported by the mast and the positioning mechanism at all times. There is no need for a separate wagon to support counterweight when less than the rated capacity is applied to the hook. Compared to the case of a free hanging counterweight as is used in some prior art mobile lift cranes, there is no need to set the counterweight unit on the ground. As a result, there is much less ground preparation needed for operation of the crane 10, This is a huge advantage over the systems presently in the field, in which the wagons are always in place and must be part of the lift planning with or without load on the hook. Frequently obstacles on the construction site make it difficult to position the crane and wagon. More recently designed telescopic systems used to position the wagon have been developed to lessen the size impact, but the wagon is still in place and must be taken into account. A critical part of having a wagon system is providing a rolling path during swing motion. With the wagons operating at very long radii (20 to 30 meters), timber matting is required for the very large sweep areas. Self supporting counterweight in the preferred embodiments of the present invention eliminates the wagon and the necessary matting.<br><br>
[0051]      The counterweight movement structure will generally be able to move the counterweight over a distance of at least 10 meters, and preferably at least 20 meters, depending on the crane size. In the embodiment of crane 10, the hydraulic cylinder 38 will preferably have a stroke of at least 5 meters. For the geometry shown, this results in the center of gravity of the counterweight unit being able to be moved to a distance of 28 meters (90 feet) from the center of rotation of the rotating bed. Alternatively, when the cylinder 38 is fully retracted, the center of gravity of the counterweight unit is only 7 meters (23 feet) from the center of rotation. This forward position can be even shorter, depending on the geometry of the positioning mechanism. Preferably the counterweight movement structure can move the counterweight to a position within 7 meters of the axis of rotation and to a position of at least 28 meters away from the axis of rotation. For the embodiment of crane 410, the counterweight movement structure can move the counterweight over a distance of at least 22 meters with a cylinder stroke of only 5.6 meters. With this configuration, the counterweight can be moved to a position within about 6 meters of the axis of rotation and to a position of at least 28 meters away from the axis of rotation. When the counterweight unit is suspended from the top of the mast, as it is in the embodiments shown in the figures, the counterweight movement structure can move and hold the counterweight at a position forward of the top of the mast such that the tension member is at an angle of over 5° compared to the axis of rotation, preferably over 10°, and more preferably over 13°. When the counterweight is at a position rearward of the top of the mast, the tension member is at an angle of at least 5°, preferably at least 10°, and more preferably over 15° compared the axis of rotation. [0052]      If desired, the extension of the cylinder 38 can be controlled by a computer to move the counterweight unit automatically to a position needed to counterbalance a load being lifted, or a luffing operation. In such cases, a pin-style load cell may be used to sense the load in the backhitch, and move the counterweight to a point where that the load is at a desired level. If desired, the counterweight unit position can be infinitely variable between any position within the range permitted by complete retraction and complete extension of the cylinder<br><br>
38. The variable positioning system self compensates for the required load moment.  In other words, if partial counterweight is installed, the counterweight will automatically be positioned farther back to offset the required load moment. Only when the maximum rearward position is reached will the crane's capacity be reduced.<br>
[0053]      In the preferred methods of the present invention, all of the counterweight is moved to the rearmost position, maximizing the counterweight's contribution to the crane's load moment. When no load is applied to the hook, the counterweight is positioned as far forward as possible. This forward position allows the counterweight to be maximized while maintaining the required backward stability. In preferred embodiments, the crane has a total amount of counterweight of at least 250 metric tonne, preferably at least 700 metric tonne, and more preferably at least 900 metric tonne, and a maximum rated load moment of at least 6,250 metric tonne-meters, preferably at least 17,500 metric tonne-meters, and more preferably at least 27,500 metric tonne-meters, and the ratio of maximum rated load moment to total weight of the counterweight is at least 25, and preferably at least 30.<br>
[0054]      As noted above, prior art designs generally had three counterweight assemblies. The variable position counterweight of the preferred crane has only one assembly. Where the conventional designs require 1,000 metric tonne of counterweight, the crane 10 with a single variable position counterweight will require approximately 70%, or 700 metric tonne of counterweight, to develop the same load moment. The 30% counterweight reduction directly reduces the cost of the counterweight, although this cost is partially offset by the cost of the positioning mechanism. As noted above, under U.S. highway constraints, 300 metric tonne of counterweight requires 15 trucks for transport. Thus, reducing the total counterweight reduces the number of trucks required to transport the crane between operational sites. The positioning mechanism is envisioned to be integrated into the rear rotating bed section and require no additional transport trucks. If it must be removed to achieve the transport weight, one truck may be required.<br><br>
[00551      Because the counterweight is reduced significantly (in the above example, 300 metric tonne), the maximum ground bearing reactions are also reduced by the same amount. The counterweight is positioned only as far rearward as required to lift the load. The crane and counterweight remain as compact as possible and only expand when additional load moment is required. A further feature is the capability to operate with reduced counterweight in the mid position. The reduced counterweight would balance the backward stability requirements when no load is applied to the hook. The variable position function could then be turned off and the crane would operate as a traditional lift crane. The system is scalable. The advantages seen on a very large capacity crane will also be seen on a crane of 300 metric tonne capacity and perhaps as small as 200 metric tonne,<br>
[0056]      It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the backhitch could comprise a strap designed to carry just a tension load if the loading and operation of the crane never produces a compressive force in the backhitch. The cylinders, rear arms and pivot frames can be interconnected differently than shown in the drawings and still be connected between the rotating bed and counterweight unit to produce the desired movement of the counterweight unit. Further, parts of the crane need not always be directly corrected together as shown in the drawings. For example, the tension member could be connected to the mast by being connected to the backhitch near where the backhitch is connected to the mast. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
