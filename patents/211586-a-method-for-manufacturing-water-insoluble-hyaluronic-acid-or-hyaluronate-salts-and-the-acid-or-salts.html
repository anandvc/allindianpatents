CROSSLINKED AMIDE DERIVATIVES OF HYALURONIC ACID AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to crosslinked amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid and manufacturing methods thereof, more particularly, a water-insoluble, crosslinked amide derivatives of hyaluronic acid characterized by crossiinking of polymer or oligomer having two or more amine groups, with hyaluronic acid or its hyaluronate salts through amidation reaction.<br>
Background Art<br>
Hyaluronic acid (hereinafter abbreviated 'HA') is a bio-polymeric material where repeat unit comprising N-acetyl-D-g!ucosamine and D-glucuronic acid is linearly repeated in connection, which polymer plentifully exists in vitreous humor, synovial fluid, connective tissues etc. In this specification,,,the term *HA* means hyaluronic acid and any of its hyaluronate salts. Hyaluronate salts according to the present invention include but not limited to inorganic salts such as sodium hyaluronate and potassium hyaluronate etc. and organic salts such as tetrabutylammonium hyaluronate etc.. Preferable hyaluronate. salt of HA according to the present invention is sodium hyaluronate.<br>
HA derivatives have been developed in diverse uses for prevention of adhesion after surgical operation, correction of facial wrinkles, dermal augmentation, tissue engineering, osteoarthritic viscosupplement etc.. HA derivatives may largely be classified by water solubility into water-soluble derivatives and water-insoluble derivatives. In the case of water-insoluble derivatives, manufacturing methods of those may largely be thought in two ways: one is to react HA with a compound having one functional group to combine this compound with linear chain of HA while the . other is to react HA with a compound having two or more functional groups to make , crosslinked HA.<br><br>
There have been reported in several literature various examples to have synthesized many crosslinked, water-insoluble HA derivatives by using compounds such as divinylsulfone, bisepoxide, bishalide, formaldehyde, etc. having two functional groups.<br>
There have been reported in U.S. Patent 4,582,865 to have used divinylsulfone in order to crosslink HA and in U.S. Patent 4,713,448 to have carried out crosslinldng reaction by using formaldehyde. And there has been reported in PCT Patent Publication WO86/00912 an example to have used compound containing epoxy groups in order to crosslink various polysaccharides containing carboxyl group.<br>
There is a report that water solubility of HA derivatives is decreased if carboxyl group of HA is activated in aqueous solution by using EDC (l-ethyl-3-(3-dimetliylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride) and then reacted with compounds containing one amine group to form amide bond (see U.S. Patent 4,937,270).

Modes for Carrying Out the invention<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the examples given hereinbelow and the accompanying tables and drawings, which are given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention.<br>
Example 1: preparation of amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan<br>
1.25 mg/ml of aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate (mol. wt. &gt; 2,000,000) and 0.625 mg/ml of aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl were prepared. The above aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl was added while the above aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate was being stured. Chitosan-hyaluronate was precipitated after the aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl had been added. pH became 4 to 5 after complete mixing of the two solutions. EDC and NHS were slowly added to the above mixed solution with concentrations according to the following Table 1 while stirring well. Reaction was carried out for two hours at 25 "C after this addition.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
The sample not added of EDC and NHS in Table 1, namely, the sample where chitosan and HA have been precipitated in form of ionic bond, may be dissolved in water under condition of high salt concentration or low'pH. IN HCl was added slowly to the above mixed solution until this sample (group A in Table 1) is completely dissolved. About 30 min. were required for this addition where about 3 ml of 1 N HCl was required for the above mixed solution 100 ml to be dissolved completely. Remainder samples (added of EDC and NHS, groups B, C, D, and E in Table 1) v/ere also treated under same condition, and unreacted chitosan and HA which were simply precipitated in ionic bond form were removed from the amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan through amidation reaction. Remainder part not dissolved even after the above acid treatment was washed with abundant water to completely remove unreacted EDC or NHS and by-products of these after which this remaining portion was vacuum dried at 25'C. Water-insoluble, amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan could be obtained through the above procedure. The more EDC and NHS were added for the reaction, the larger quantity of final product could be obtained. The following resultant percentages are the yields of the amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan which were obtained for respective specimen groups: 49 % from Group B, 58 % from Group C, 71 % from Group D, and 77 % from Group E.<br>
Example 2: preparation of amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan<br>
1.25 mg/ml of aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate (mol. wt. 
 <br>
NHS were added for the reaction, the larger quantity of final product was able to be obtained as described in Example 1. The following resultant percentages are the yields of the amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan which were obtained for respective specimen groups: 53 % from Group B-1, 62 % from Group C-1, 69 % from Group D-1, and 77 % from Group E-1.<br>
Example 3: a test of resistance to acid and high salt concentration and a confirmation of amide formation in the amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan<br>
1.25 mg/mi of aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate and 0.625 mg/ml of aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl were prepared. The above aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl was added while the above aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate was being stirred. Chitosan-hyaluronate was precipitated after the aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl had been added. pH became 4 to 5 after complete mixing of the two solutions. EDC and NHS were slowly added to the above mixed solution with concentrations according to the following Table 2 while stirring well. Reaction was carried out for two hours at 25°C after the addition.<br>
If it is not treated by acid after reaction but is washed with water several times to refme product and then vacuum dried, chitosan-HA complex precipitated by ionic bond also remains in fmal product in mixed situation. Products were obtained by acid treatment and refinement through same procedure as described in Example 1 in case where EDC and NHS were added (samples A, B and C in Table 2) while chitosan-HA complex precipitated by ionic bond was obtained by refimng without acid treatment in case where EDC and NHS were not added (sample D in Table 2). Then, these were vacuum dried and were dispersed in 0.1 N HCI (aq.) so that each sample becomes 0.02 % (w/v), and then respective times elapsed to dissolve completely were measured, which are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
The Table 2 samples were added while stirring to become 1 % (w/v) in 1 N NaCl (aq.) in order to examine endurance of Table 2 samples to high salt concentration. Transparent solution was made as the precipitate was completely dissolved in 30 min. only for case of sample D while other samples maintained their respective forms over ten days. This result means that samples A, B and C did not form complex by ionic bond, but were crosslinked by covalent bond between chitosan and HA,<br>
Infrared spectroscopy spectra for samples A through D which have been vacuum dried after preparing and refining as described in Example 3 are presented in figures 1 to 4. It was shown that the peak around 1728.6 cm-1 by C=0 stretch of carboxyl group of HLAL having made a salt with chitosan amine that has accepted proton is relatively decreased as the crosslinking reaction is progressed (cf. Fig. 1 to 4). It was shown that the peak around 1557.5 cm-1 owing to deformation of primary amine of chitosan which has accepted proton is relatively decreased as the crosslinking reaction is progressed so that it remains only as a shoulder form in the case of sample A (cf Fig. 1 to 4). This result shows that quantity of amine group and carboxyl group which were forming ionic bond (salt form) is decreased with their reaction and it coincides with the fact that the peak around 1600.6 cm"^ by C=0 stretch of amide is relatively increased as the crosslinking reaction is progressed (cf. Fig. 1 to 4). As it has been generally known that hydrogen bonding is increased as the crosslinking is progressed wherewith the peak by C=0 stretch of amide is moved down to a lower wavenumber, now the fact that the peak appeared at wavenumber (1600.6cm-1) that is lower than<br><br>
ordinary amide pealc location (around I660cm-1 J. Bioactive &amp; Compatible Polymers, 9, 429-447 (1994)) coincides with the fact that material according to the present invention has been crosslinked as shown by the test of resistance to acid and high salt concentration. These data confirm that these derivatives of HA according to the present invention have been crosslinked by amide formation. Formation of ester (1745 to 1760cm-1) or anhydride of carboxylic acid (1800cm-1), which can occur as side reaction was not observed on spectrums (Silverstein et al, Spectrometric Identification of Organic Compounds, pp. 122 to 124, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981)). Formation of N-acylurea (1700cm-1) that is a by-product that may be made when using EDC was not also observed on spectrums (see U.S. Patent 5,527,893).<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically shows the structure of amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan and its synthesis procedure by summarizing the above spectral analysis result and the above test result of resistance to acid and high salt concentration.<br>
Example 4 : preparation of crosslinked amide derivatives of HA by using deacetylated HA<br>
If the temperature of HA solution is raised under high or low pH condition, deacetylation is progressed along with chain decomposition so as to form quite an active amine. This amine may form amide bond with carboxyl group by the same chemistry as that of chitosan in Example 1 or 2.<br>
Reaction was carried out for 1 to 30 hours at 25 to 50'C with HA by using 0.2 to ION NaOH (aq.) in order to deacetylate HA. Reaction was terminated by neutralization with HCl after which deacetylated HA was obtained by freeze-drying after dialysis. Degree of deacetylation was determined after measuring quantity of amine group formed as the result of reaction by using Roth's fluorimetric method (see Anal, Chem., 1971, 43, 880 to 882; J. Chromatogr., 1973, 83, 353 to 356; Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem., 1976,14, 361 to 364). Degree of deacetylation was calculated from the following equation.<br>
Degree of deacetylation =[Conc. of amines formed]/[Conc. of repeat units of HA] x lOO(%)<br><br>
Concentration of repeat units of HA was obtained by quantifying carboxyl group according to the presumption that a carboxyl group exists per repeat unit of HA. Carboxyl group quantification was done by carbazole method (Anal. Biochem., 1962, 4, 330),<br>
Degree of deacetyiation became 1 to 40% as the result of reaction. The amidation reaction was carried out using deacetylated HA obtained by the above method. EDC (2.4ing/ml) and NHS (2.9mg/ml) were added into deacetylated HLA (lOing/<br>
ml), which was reacted for 2 hours at 25'C , then the derivatives formed were refined and vacuum dried. Water-insoluble gel was formed in yield of 51%. As test result of resistance to acid and hiah salt concentration for the above formed water-insoluble, crosslinked amide derivatives of HA, said amide derivatives maintained its form of undissolved status over 48 hours in O.IN HCl aqueous solution and over 10 days in IN NaCl aqueous solution. This test method was the same as in the above example 3.<br>
Example 5 : preparation of amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with deacetylated HA<br>
In deacetylated HA, there is a lot of amine groups reactable with carboxyl group as in chitosan. Water-insoluble, amide derivatives of HA as described in example 1 utilizing these amine groups were obtained. After making mixed aqueous solution of deacetylated HA and sodium hyaluronate (mol. wt. &gt; 2,000,000) by amount of 0.5 mg/<br>
m^ for each of both, EDC (0.2 mg/M) and NHS (0.24 mg/ml were added to the mixed aqueous solution to react for 2 hours at 25°C after which the product was refined and dried. Water-insoluble gel was formed in yield of 56% as the result. As test result of resistance to acid and high salt concentration for the above formed water-insoluble, crosslinked amide derivatives of HA, said amide derivatives of HA maintained its form of undissolved status over 48 hours in O.IN HCl aqueous solution and over 10 days in IN NaCl aqueous solution. This test method was the same as in the above example 3.<br>
Example 6 : manufacturing membrane made of amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan<br>
1.25mgM of aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate (mol. wt. &gt; 2,000,000)<br>
and 0.625mg/ml of aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl were prepared. The above aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate was poured into glass plate, then EDC and<br><br>
NHS were added to the above aqueous solution of sodium hyaluronate in various concentrations of such as Groups B, C, D and E of Table 1. After they were well mixed, the above aqueous solution of chitosan-HCl was added to the plate to produce white membrane in the plate. There could be obtained membrane made of amide derivatives of HA crosslinked with chitosan by drying the above white membrane.
