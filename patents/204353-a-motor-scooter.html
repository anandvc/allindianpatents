As a technology related to a scooter type motorcycle of a style of attaching a front wheel via a swing arm, for example, there is provided Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 2-175483 "Front wheel suspension apparatus of scooter type vehicle". According to the above-described technology, in reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of the publication, a rear frame 3 is extended upwardly from rear end portions of a pair of left and right floor pipes 2 installed with a feet mounting plate 17 (numerals described in the publication are cited, the same as follows), a rear wheel 5 is attached to the rear frame 3 via rear arms 4a and 4b and an engine 8 is mounted at rear portions of the floor pipes 2, erected pipes 10 are extended upwardly from front end portions of the floor pipes 2, a head pipe 12 is attached to upper end portions of the erected pipes 10 via stays 11, a bar handle 15 is supported by the head pipe 12, underbrackets 20 are extended forwardly from the front end portions of the floor pipes 2, a lower arm 21 is attached to the underbrackets 20 swingably in an up and down direction and a front wheel 31 is attached to a front end portion of the lower arm 21 to thereby constitute a scooter type "motorcycle.<br>
(Problems to be Solved by the Invention] According to the above-described conventional technology, there is constituted an integrated frame 1 by bonding the rear frame 3, the erected pipes 10, the stays 11, the head pipe 12<br><br><br>
and the underbrackets 20 to the floor pipes 2.<br>
The frame 1 integrated in this way is integrated with (1)  the rear wheel 5 via the rear arms 4a and 4b and a rear suspension system comprising a hydraulic pressure damper 6 and the like, integrated withÂ© the front wheel 31 via a front suspension system comprising a hydraulic pressure damper 38 and the like and integrated with(3) a steering system of the bar handle 15, a shaft 40, a steering arm 30 and the like.<br>
However, in assembling a scooter type motorcycle, generally, in a final assembly line, the front and the rear suspension systems and the steering system are integrated to the frame 1. Various kinds of parts are integrated to the comparatively large-sized frame 1 and therefore, an operational space is large, when the operational space is large, an operational range of an operator becomes wide, the burden of the operator is increased and therefore, there is a room for improvement.<br>
Further, in the final assembly line, all the parts are integrated to the frame 1 and therefore, the final assembly line is obliged to be large-sized and complicated.<br>
Further, the erected pipes 10 as well as the under brackets 20 are welded to the front end portions of the floor pipes 2 . Owing to bonding by welding, control of respective dimensional accuracies is not easy with regard to pivot positions of the underbrackets 20 for supporting the lower arm 21 and a position of the head pipe 12 . Accordingly, a number of controlling steps<br><br>
is increased.<br>
Hence, it is an object of the present invention (1) to promote integrating operational performance and simplify a final assembly line and (2) to facilitate respective dimensional accuracies of pivot positions of stays for supporting swing arms and a position of a head pipe in a scooter type motorcycle of a style of attaching a front wheel via the swing arms.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, a scooter type motorcycle according to Claim 1, a front portion of a vehicle body frame is attached with a front wheel via a swing arm and installed with a head pipe, a middle portion of the vehicle body frame is mounted with a step floor for mounting feet and a rear portion of the vehicle body frame is attached with a rear wheel via a swing type power unit, the vehicle body frame is constituted so that a front frame is coupled to a rear frame dividably at a position below the step floor.<br>
By partially integrating the front suspension system, the steering system and the front wheel to the front frame, there is provided a partially assembled body of the front portion. By partially integrating the swing type power unit and the rear wheel to the rear frame, there is provided a partially assembled body of the rear portion. The partially assembled body of the front portion and the partially assembled body of the rear<br><br>
portion which are respectively provided, are integrated to thereby complete a scooter type motorcycle. The front portion and the rear portion are partially integrated separately and accordingly, the integrating operational performance is promoted.  In the final assembly line, the rear frame may be coupled to the front frame which is partially assembled separately and the final assembly line can be simplified.<br>
A scooter type motorcycle according to Claim 2, characterized in that a front portion of a vehicle body frame is installed with a head pipe and attached with a front wheel via stays and a swing arm extended forwardly, a middle portion of the vehicle body frame is mounted with a step floor for mounting feet and a rear portion of the vehicle body frame is attached with a rear wheel via a swing type power unit, the front portion of the vehicle body frame is constituted of an integrated cast article including the stays as well as the head pipe.<br>

'â . ;â &gt;'â "<br>
Fig. 6 is a view viewing Fig. 5 in an arrow mark direction 6, showing a planar constitution of the front frame 2F, that is, the front portion of the vehicle body frame.<br>
The front frame 2F is a frame member substantially in a square shape in plane view comprising left and right side members 71, a front cross member 72 spanning front ends of the side members 71 and a rear cross member 73 spanning rear ends of the side members 71, further, an integrated cast article is constituted thereby including the left and right stays 31 formed by extending forwardly front ends of the side members 71, the head post 51 extended from the front upper portion of the cross member 72 in a front skew direction and the head pipe 52 installed at the front end of the head pipe post 51.<br>
Since the front portion of the vehicle body frame 2 is constituted of the integrated cast article including the stays 31, the head post 51 and the head pipe 52, in forming the front portion of the vehicle body frame 2, positions of the stays 31 as well as a position of the head pipe 52 are self-evidently determined relative to the vehicle body frame 2. As a result, the positions of the pivot holes 31a of the stays 31 for supporting the swing arm 33 (refer to Fig. 2), that is, the<br><br><br>
pivot positions are also self-evidently determined relative to the position of the head pipe 52. Accordingly, control of respective dimensional accuracies of the position of the head<br>
pipe 52 and the pivot positions is facilitated.<br>
:Further, by further forwardly extending the front ends of the side members 71, the left and right stays 31 are formed, the front portion of the vehicle body frame 2 is constituted of the integrated cast article including these stays 31 and therefore, large load operated on the stays 31 from the front wheel 3 shown by Fig. 2 via the swing arm 33, can efficiently be transmitted to the side members 71 and can be received by a total of the vehicle body frame 2. Since the load is received by the total of the vehicle body frame 2 , the total of the vehicle body frame 2 can be constituted of a rational thin-walled member. As a result, light weight formation and low price formation of the vehicle body frame 2 can be achieved.<br>
Such a front frame 2F is constituted of a die-cast article of an aluminum alloy.<br>
Since the front frame 2 is constituted of the frame member having substantially the square shape in plane view, the rigidity of the front frame 2F can be promoted.<br>
The left and right side members 71 are provided with dividing faces 74 on rear upper faces thereof and four pieces of the coupling bolt holes 75 â¢â¢â¢  (â¢â¢â¢ designates plurality, the same as follows) are perforated at the dividing faces 74.<br><br>
Fig. 7 is a view viewing" Fig. 5 in an arrow mark 7 direction, showing a rear face constitution of the rear frame 2R, that is, the rear portion of the vehicle body frame.<br>
As described above, the rear arm 61 is continuously extended from the upper portion of the rear end portion of the rear frame 2R. The rear frame 2R as well as the rear arm 61 is a frame member having substantially a square-like shape in rear view comprising left and right side members 81, a lower cross member 82 spanning rear lower ends of the side members 81 and an upper cross member 83 spanning upper ends of the side members 81. Further, the rear frame 2R is constituted of an integrated cast articled including the rear arm 61. Such a rear frame 2R is a die-cast article of an aluminum alloy. Since the rear frame 2R as well as the rear arm 61 is constituted of the frame member having the substantially square-like shape in rear<br>
view, the rigidity of the rear frame 2R can be promoted.<br><br>
The left and right side members 81 are provided with dividing faces 84 (refer to Fig. 5) at front lower faces thereof, four pieces of coupling bolt holes 85 â¢â¢â¢ are perforated at the dividing faces 84, further, four pieces of stay attaching bolts 86 â¢â¢â¢ for the power unit are perforated at rear faces thereof and four pieces of bolt holes 88 â¢â¢â¢ for attaching four pieces of stand brackets are perforated at a rear lower inclined faces 87. The left side member 81 is installed with, the rear cushion attaching boss 65 at an upper side portion thereof. Notation P designates the center of the rear pivot shaft for the power unit.<br><br>
Fig. 8 is a side sectional view of a coupling portion of the vehicle body frame according to the present invention, showing that the dividing face 84 provided at the front end of the rear frame 2R is made to overlap the dividing face 74 provided at the rear end of the front frame 2F and coupled thereto by bolts and nuts 89 â¢â¢â¢ inserted through the coupling bolt holes 75.â¢â¢ and 85 â¢.â¢ . In this way, the rear frame 2R can be coupled to the front frame 2F dividably at the position of the dividing line W.<br>
Since the dividing line W is constituted by an inclined line and accordingly, a pitch (separation distance) between the bolts and nuts 89 can be increased. Therefore, a rigidity of coupling the front frame 2F and the rear frame 2R can be promoted.<br>
Fig. 9 is a rear view of a constitution in which the main stand is attached to the rear frame according to the present invention, showing that left and right stand brackets 91 are attached to rear end portions (rear lower inclined faces 87) of the left and right side members 81 of the rear frame 2R by bolts 92 â¢â¢â¢ , the main stand 93 having a gate-like shape in rear view is attached to the left and right stand brackets 91 swingably in the forward and rearward direction, further, the side stand 95 is attached to the left side brackets 91 swingably in the forward and rearward direction.<br>
The vehicle body frame 2 is provided with the large<br><br>
rigidity and accordingly, the main stand 93 can be swingably attached only by the left and right stand brackets 91. Therefore, a support pipe extended in a vehicle width direction which is conventionally regarded as indispensable can be abolished and light weight formation of the vehicle can be achieved.<br>
The main stand 93 is provided with a foot depressing portion 96 extended from a left rear portion thereof in a left rearward direction and the main stand 93 can be operated to erect by the foot depressing portion 96. Numerals 97 and 98 designate tension springs.<br>

(2)	Further, in a second partial assembly line, the rear suspension system 8 of the swing type power unit 6, the rear wheel 7, the rear cushion 64 and the like and the main stand 93 are partially assembled to the rear frame 2R to thereby provide a partially assembled body 1R of the rear portion.<br><br>
Further, at this step, a member of the seat 9 or the like shown by imaginary lines may be assembled.<br>
(3)	Next, the dividing face 84 of the rear frame 2R is made to overlap the dividing face 74 of the front frame 2F and coupled thereto by bolts to thereby assemble the partially assembled body 1F of the front portion and the partially assembled body 1R of the rear portion which have been respectively fabricated into a semifinished vehicle.<br>
(4)	Finally, in a final assembly line, various kinds of members of accessories, lamps, covers and the like are integrated to the above-described semifinished vehicle to thereby complete a scooter type motorcycle.<br>
As described above, owing to the scooter type motorcycle which has been coupled dividably, the partially assembled body 1F of the front portion and the partially assembled body 1R of the rear portion can be assembled by the first and the second partial assembly lines which are separate from each other and are small-scaled. The partially assembled bodies 1F and 1R of the front portion and the rear portion are small-sized in comparison with a finished vehicle and accordingly, an operational space for integrating respective parts can be made small. When the operational space is small, the operational range of the operator is narrowed and accordingly, burden on the operator can be alleviated. Therefore, the integrating operational performance can further be promoted. Further, the partially integrated bodies 1F and 1R of the front portion and the rear portion can be assembled at optimum arbitrary<br><br>
locations separately from the final assembly line. For example, the partially assembled bodies of the front portion and the rear portion can also be assembled at factories for fabricating respective parts constituting these assembled bodies.<br>
The rear wheel 7 and the main stand 93 is partially integrated to the rear frame 2R and accordingly, in the second partial assembly line, in assembling the partially integrated body 1R of the rear portion, the rear frame 2R.in the midst of assembling operation can be brought into a stable self standing state without using a special supporting jig.<br>
In the final assembly line, the rear frame 2R is only coupled to the rear frame 2F partially assembled separately, the final assembly line.can be simplified and the degree of freedom of design can be promoted in arranging the final assembly line in a limited space.<br>
Further, the final assembly line is provided with an operational space larger than those of the first and the second partial assembly lines. Although when the operational space is large, the operational range of the operator is liable to be widened and the burden on the operator is liable to increase, since the rear frame 2R is. coupled to the front frame 2F partially integrated separately and accordingly, a number of assembling steps at the final assembly line is reduced and as a result, the burden can be alleviated.<br>
Further, the rear frame 2R is coupled to the front frame 2F partially assembled separately at a position below the step<br><br>
floor 15 (refer to Fig. 1) having further excellent integrating performance and accordingly, the integrating operational performance is further promoted.<br>
Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) are views of. a modified example of the front frame according to the present invention, Fig. 11(a) shows a constitution of the left side face of the front frame and Fig. 11(b) shows a constitution of viewing Fig. 11(a) in a direction of an arrow mark b.<br>
The front frame 2F of the modified example is featured in that the front portion of the front cross member 72 is integrally formed with the left and right stays 31 which are extended forwardly. Other constitution of the front frame 2F is the same as the constitution shown by Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, described above, the same notations are attached thereto and an explanation thereof will be omitted.<br><br>
Further, according to the above-described embodiments of the present invention, a drive source of the power unit 6 is not limited to the engine 6A but may be, for example, an electrically driven motor or a hybrid of an electrically driven motor and the engine 6a.<br>
The vehicle body frame 2 according to the present invention specified by Claim 1 may be of a constitution in which the frame 2R is coupled dividably to the rear frame 2R at a position below the step floor 15 and the constitution of the cast article is arbitrary.<br>
The vehicle body frame 2 according to the present<br><br>
invention specified by Claim 2 may be of an integrated cast article in which at least a front portion thereof includes the stays 31 and the head pipe 52, further, the integrated cast article is not limited to a die-cast article of an aluminum alloy, furthermore, it is arbitrary to divide the front frame 2F from the rear frame 2R.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention achieves the following effects by the above-described constitution.<br>
According to Claim 1, the vehicle frame is constituted such that the rear frame is coupled dividably to the rear frame at the position below the step floor and accordingly, the scooter type motorcycle can be completed by partially integrating the front suspension system and the steering system to the front frame to thereby provide the partially integrated body of the f rontportion, partially integrating the swing type power unit to the rear frame to thereby provide the partially  assembled body of the rear portion and integrating the partially assembled body of the rear portion to the partially assembled body of the front portion.<br><br>
Accordingly, the partially assembled body of the front portion and the partially assembled body of the rear portion can be integrated by small-scaled partial assembly lines which are separated from each other. The partially assembled bodies of the front portion and the rear portion are small-sized in comparison with a completed vehicle, resulting in making small<br><br>
the operational space for integrating respective parts. When the operational space is small, the operational range of the operator is narrowed and accordingly, the burden on the operator can be alleviated. Therefore, the integrating operational performance is further promoted. Further, the partially assembled bodies of the front portion and the rear portion can be integrated at optimum arbitrary locations separately from the final assembly line.<br><br>
At the final assembly line, the rear frame may only be coupled to the front frame partially integrated separately, the final assembly line can be simplified and the degree of freedom of design can be promoted for arranging the final assembly line to a limited space.<br>
Further, at the final assembly line, the operational space is larger than those of the partial assembly lines. Although when the operational space is large, the operational range of the operator is widened and the burden on the operator is liable to increase, since the rear frame is coupled to the front frame partially assembled separately, a number of assembling steps at the final assembly line is reduced and as a result, the burden can be alleviated.<br>
Furthermore, the rear frame is coupled to the front frame, partially assembled separately at the position below the step floor having the most excellent integrating performance and accordingly, the integrating operational performance is further promoted.<br><br>
According to Claim 2, the front portion of the vehicle frame is constituted of the integrated cast article including the head pipe and the stays and accordingly, in forming the front portion of the vehicle body frame, the position of  the head pipe and the positions of the stays are self-evidently determined relative to the vehicle body frame. As a result, the pivot positions of the stays supporting the swing arms is self-evidently determined relative to the position of the head pipe. Therefore, control, of respective dimensional accuracies of the position of the head pipe and the pivot<br>
positions is facilitated.<br><br>
