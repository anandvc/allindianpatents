PROSIDION LIMITED of WATLINGTON ROAD,  OXFORD, 0X4 6LT, UINITED KINGDOM, UNITED KINGDOM Company<br><br><br>
5 FEB 2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
5-2-2007<br><br>
1 <br>
Field of the invention	*<br>
The present invention relates to the area of dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibition and, more particularly, relates to glutaminyl pyrrolidine and glutaminyl thiazolidine, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and the use of said compounds in inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase IV and dipeptidyl peptidase IV - like enzyme activity.<br>
Background Art<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) is a serine protease which cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from a peptide chain containing, preferably, a proline residue in the penulitimate positionAlthough the biological role of DPIV in mammalian systems has not been completely established, it is believed to play an important role in neuropeptide metabolism, T-cell activation, attachment of canter cells to the endothelium and the entry of HIV into lymphoid cells.<br>
Likewise, it was discovered that DPIV is responsible for inactivating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide also known as gastric-inhibitory peptide (GIP). Since GLP-1 is a major stimulator of pancreatic insulin secretion and has direct beneficial effects on glucose disposal, in WO 97/40832 and US 6,303,661 inhibition of DPIV and DPIV-like enzyme activity was shown to represent an attractive approach e.g. for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes meilitus (NIDDM). It is an aspect of the present invention to provide ;fiew DPIV inhibitors Which are effective e.g. in treating conditions mediated by inhibition of DPIV and DPIV-like enzymesi pharmaceutical compositions e.g. useful in inhibiting DPIV and DPIV-like enzymes and a method of inhibiting said enzyme activity. Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of treatment, in particular to a method for the treatment of diabetes meilitus, especially non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) or Type-2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes meilitus and to compositions for use in such method.<br>
2 <br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) is a post-proline (to a lesser extent post-alanine, post-<br>
serine or post-glycine) cleaving serine protease found in various tissues of the body<br>
including kidney, liver, and intestine.<br>
It is known that DPIV inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of impaired glucose<br>
* tolerance and diabetes mellitus (International Patent Application, Publication Number<br>
WO 99/61431, Pederson RA et al, Diabetes. 1998 Aug; 47(8):1253-8 and Pauly RP et"<br>
al, Metabolism 1999 Mar; 48(3):385-9). In particular WO 99/61431 discloses DPIV<br>
inhibitors comprising an amino acid residue and a thiazolidine or pyrrolidine group, and<br>
salts thereof, especially L-threo-lsoleucyl thiazolidine, L-a//o-lsoleucyl thiazolidine, L-<br>
threoo-isoleucyl pyrrolidine, L-alo-isoleucyl thiazolidine, L-a//o-lsoleucyl pyrrolidine, and<br>
salts thereof.<br>
Further examples for low molecular weight dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are agents<br>
such as tetrahydroisoquinolin-3-carboxamide derivatives, N-substituted 2-cyanopyroles<br>
and -pyrrolidines, N-(N"-substituted glycyl)-2-cyanopyrrolidines, N-(substituted glycyl)-<br>
thiazolidines, N-(substituted glycyl)-4-cyanothiazolidines, boronyl inhibitors and<br>
cyclopropyl-fused pyrrolidines. Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV are described in US<br>

The present invention relates to the area of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) inhibition and, more particularly, relates to glutaminyl pyrrolidine and glutaminyl thiazolidine, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and the use of said compounds in inhibiting DPIV and DPIV-like enzyme activity. The present invention provides new DPIV inhibitors, which are effective e.g. in treating conditions mediated by DPIV inhibition, pharmaceutical compositions e.g. useful in inhibiting DPIV and DPIV-like enzyme activity and a method of inhibiting DPIV and DPIV-like enzyme activity.<br>
The present invention provides a compound of the formula:<br><br>
5<br><br>
and especially a compound of the formula (I)<br><br>
(I)<br>
or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
A further preferred compound of the present invention is the compound of formula II:<br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be converted into acid addition salts, especially pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt generally takes a form in which an amino acids basic side chain is protonated with an inorganic or organic acid. Representative organic or inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, perchloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, benzoic,<br>

mandelic, methanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesuifonic, p-toulenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic, saccharide or , trifluoroacetic acid. All pharmaceutical acceptable acid addition salt forms of the compounds of the present invention are intended to be embraced by the scope of this invention.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the free compounds and the compounds in the<br><br>
form of their salts, whenever a compound is refejred to in this context, a corresponding    salt is also intended, provided such is possible or appropriate under the circumstances. .<br>
The present invention further includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the desired therapeutically active compound. Thus, in these cases, the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with prodrug versions of one or more of the claimed compounds, but which converts to the above specified compound in vivo after administration to the subject. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs",*ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985 and the patent applications DE 198 28 113, DE 198 28 114, WO 99/67228 and WO 99/67279 which are fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral center, they*<br><br>
may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more    chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms of the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e. hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
7<br><br>
The compounds, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.<br>
As indicated above, the compounds of the present invention and especially the	 <br>
compounds of formulas I and II, and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable -<br>
acid addition salt forms, are useful in inhibiting DPIV and DPIV - like enzyme activity.  <br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding	 <br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms to inhibit DPIV and DPIV - like   <br>
*	 <br>
enzyme activity may be demonstrated employing the DPIV activity assay for	 <br>
determination of the K-values in vitro and in human plasma, as described in examples^ and 5. The Ki-values of the compounds of the present invention were determined for glutaminyl thiazolidine as K| = 3.12*10"7 M ± 5.11*10"10M and for glutaminyl pyrrolidine as Ki = 1.30*1 0"6 M ± 8.49*10"8 M against porcine kidney DPIV. The Ki-values of the compounds of the present invention were determined for glutaminyl thiazolidine as Ki = 4.03*1ir7 M ± 2.19*10"10M after 5 min 5.13M0"7 M ± 1.26*10*M after 22 hours pre¬incubation, and for glutaminyl pyrrolidine as Ki = 1.30*10*6 M ± 4,89*10"8 M after 5 min and 1.36*10"6 M ± 3,21 MO"8 M after 22 hours pre-incubation in human plasma.<br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms to inhibit DPIV in vivo may be<br>
demonstrated by oral or intravasal administration to Wistar rats, as described in<br>
example 9. The compounds of the present invention inhibit DPIV activity in vivo after <br>
both, oral and intravasal administration to Wistar rats.	 <br>
DPIV is present in a wide variety of mammalian organs and tissues e.g. the intestinal , brush-border (Gutschmidt S. et al., "In situ" - measurements of protein contents in the brush border region along rat jejunal villi and their correlations with four enzyme activities. Histochemistry 1981, 72 (3), 467-79), exocrine epithelia, hepatocytes, renal tubuli, endothelia, myofibroblasts (Feller A.C. et al., A monoclonal antibody detecting dipeptidylpeptidase IV in human tissue. Virchows Arch. A. Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1986; 409 (2):263-73), nerve cells, lateral membranes of certain surface epithelia, e.g.<br>
8<br><br>
Fallopian tube, uterus and vesicular gland, in the luminal cytoplasm of e.g., vesicular j<br>
gland epithelium, and in mucous cells of Brunner"s gland (Hartel S. et al., Dipeptidyl<br>
peptidase (DPP) IV in rat organs. Comparison of immunohistochemistry and activity j;<br>
histochemistry. Histochemistry 1988; 89 (2): 151-61), reproductive organs, e.g. cauda  <br>
epididymis and ampulla, seminal vesicles and their secretions (Agrawal &amp; Vanha- <br>
Perttula, Dipeptidyl peptidases in bovine reproductive organs and secretions. Int. J. <br>
Androl. 1986,9 (6): 435-52). In human serum, two molecular forms of dipeptidyl	 <br>
peptidase are present (Krepela E. et al., Demonstration of two molecular forms of      I<br><br>
dipeptidyl peptidase IV in normal human serum. Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1983, 32 (6):   "j<br>
■ *	"	 <br>
486-96). The serum high molecular weight form of DPIV is expressed on the surface of<br>
activated T cells (Duke-Cohan J.S. et al.. Serum high molecular weight dipeptidyl  <br>
peptidase IV (CD26) is similar to a novel antigen DPPT-L released from activated T<br>
cells. J. Immunol. 1996,156 (5): 1714-21).<br>
The compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salt forms are able to inhibit DPIV in vivo. In one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, all molecular forms, homologues and epitopes of DPIV from all<br>
mammalian tissues and organs, also of those, which are undiscovered yet, are intendeci<br>
to be embraced by the scope of this invention.	 <br><br>
Among the rare group of proline-specific proteases, DPIV was originally believed to be the only membrane-bound enzyme specific for proline as the penultimate residue at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide chain. However, other molecules, even structurally! non-homologous with the DPIV but bearing corresponding enzyme activity, have beer! identified recently. DPIV-like enzymes, which are identified so far, are e.g. fibroblast./ activation protein a, dipeptidyl peptidase IV p, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein, N-acetylated a-linked acidic dipeptidase, quiescent cell proline dipeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase II, attractin and dipeptidyl peptidase IV related protein (DPP 8), and are described in the review article by Sedo &amp; Malik (Sedo &amp; Malik, Dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like molecules: homologous proteins or homologous activities? Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 2001,36506:1-10).<br>
9<br><br>
Further DPIV-like enzymes are disclosed in WO 01/19866, WO 02/04610, WO 02/34900 and WO02/31134. WO 01/19866 discloses novel human dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPP8) with structural und functional similarities to DPIV and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). WO 02/04610 provides reagents, which regulate human dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like enzyme and reagents which bind to human dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like enzyme gene product. These reagents can play a role in preventing,* ameliorating, or correcting dysfunctions or diseases including, but not limited to, tumors , and peripheral and central nervous system disorders including pain and neurodegenerative disorders. The dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like enzyme of WO 02/04610 is well known in the art. In the Gene Bank data base, this enzyme is registered as KIAA1492 (registration in February 2001, submitted on April 04, 2000, AB040925).       ; WO 02/34900 discloses a dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) with significant homology with* the amino acid sequences of DPIV and DPP8. WO 02/31134 discloses three DPIV-like enzymes, DPRP1, DPRP2 and DPRP3. Sequence analysis revealed, that DPRP1 is identical to DPP8, as disclosed in WO 01/19866, that DPRP2 is identical to DPP9 and that DPRP3 is identical to KIAA1492 as disclosed in WO 02/04610.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, all molecular forms, homologues and epitopes of proteins comprising DPIV-like enzyme activity, from all    mammalian tissues and organs, also of those, which are undiscovered yet, are intended  <br>
to be embraced by the scope of this invention.<br><br><br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding	 <br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms to inhibit DPIV-like enzymes may.<br><br>
be demonstrated employing an enzyme activity assay for determination of the Kj-valuejs<br>
in vitro as described in example 6. The Ki-values of the compounds of the present  <br>
invention against porcine dipeptidyl peptidase II were determined as K = 8.52*10"5 M ±<br>
S.33*106 M for glutaminyl pyrrolidine and Ki = 1.07*10* M ± 3.81*10-7 M for glutaminyl<br>
thiazolidine. All compounds inhibit porcine dipeptidyl peptidase II.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms<br>
10<br><br>
have only low, if no inhibitory activity against non-DPIV and non-DPIV - like proline specific enzymes. As described in example 7, with glutaminyl thiazolidine and glutaminyl pyrrolidine no inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase I and prolyl oligopeptidase was found. Against prolidase, both compounds showed a marked lower efficacy<br>
 mpared to DPIV. The IC 50-values against prolidase were determined as IC so &gt; 3mM for glutaminyl thiazolidine and as IC 50 = 3.4*10"*M ± 5.63*10"5 for glutaminyl pyrrolidin|. <br><br>
 n view of their ability to inhibit DPIV and DPIV - like enzyme activity, the compounds of "<br>
the present invention, especially the compounds of formulas I and II, and their	 <br>
corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms, are useful in  treating conditions mediated by said enzyme activities. Thus, the compounds disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of conditions such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, arthritis, obesity, immune and autoimmune disorders, allograft transplantation, cancer, neuronal disorders like multiple sclerosis and dermal diseases.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of this invention, the compounds of the present invention and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms, improve glucose tolerance by lowering elevated blood glucose levels in response to an oral glucose challenge and, therefore, are useful in treating non-insulin-dependent     diabetes mellitus. The ability of the compounds of the present invention, and their       corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms, to improve glucose tolerance in response to an oral glucose challenge, may be measured in diabetic Zucker;<br>
rats. The method is described in examples 10 and 11. Oral administration of 5 mg/kg " <br><br>
b.w., 15 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg b.w. glutaminyl thiazolidine or glutaminyl pyrrolidine        <br>
resulted in a dose dependent lowering of elevated blood glucose levels and thereby in*   <br>
an improvement of glucose tolerance in diabetic Zucker rats.	  -<br>
The compounds of the present invention are, according to example 5, stable in human plasma. Surprisingly, and as a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, " the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt forms, may be degraded in vivo following administration to a mammal. The ability of the compounds of the present invention, and their<br>
11<br><br>
corresponding pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salt forms, to be degraded in vivo may be determined employing the Wistar rat model and subsequent LC/MS analysis. Glutaminyl thiazolidine was found to be degraded following oral administration to Wistar rats, to the respective pyroglutaminyl thiazolidine.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method of treating a condition mediated by modulation of the DPIV or DPIV - like enzyme activity in a subject in need thereof which comprises administering any of the compounds of te present invention or pharmaceutical compositions thereof in a quantity and dosing regimen therapeutically effective to treat the condition. Additionally, the present invention includes the use of the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salt forms, for the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of a condition mediated by modulation of the DPIV activity in a: subject. The compound may be administered to a patient by any conventional route of administration, including, but not limited to, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and parenteral.<br>
In an further embodiment, the present invention provides formulations for the compounds of the present invention, and their corresponding pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salt forms, in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human, being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br><br><br>
12<br><br><br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the claimed compounds in the therapeutically effective amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the claimed compounds.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or more compounds<br>
of the present invention, especially compounds of the formulas I or II, and their	 <br>
corresponding pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salt forms, as the active       <br>
ingredient, are intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to	 <br>
conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide  <br>
variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g.,  <br>
oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage^<br>
form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral    <br>
preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers"<br>
and additives may advantageously include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring        <br>
agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations such as,<br>
for example, powders, capsules, gelcaps and tablets, suitable earners and additives<br>
include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegratirig<br>
agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric<br>
coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise steriife<br>
water, through other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or<br>
for preservation, may be included.	 <br>
Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers,<br>
suspending agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions ;<br>
herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful ;.<br>
  &gt; and the like, an amount of the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dosev &gt; <br><br>
as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg (preferably about 5 to about 500 mg) and may be, given at a dosage of from about 0.1 to about 300 mg/kg bodyweight per day (preferably<br>
13<br><br>
1 to 50 mg/kg per day). The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the    requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic      dosing may be employed.  Typically the dosage will be regulated by the physician based on the characteristics of the patient, his/her condition and the therapeutic effectj<br>
desired.	 <br><br>
 Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills,  <br>
capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered ; <br>
aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral<br>
parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by      <br>
inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form     <br>
suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt,<br>
of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot<br>
preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets;<br>
the principal active ingredient is ideally mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc,;<br>
stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other<br>
pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition<br>
containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a      <br>
pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation       <br>
compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is ideally dispersed<br>
evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided^;<br>
into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid    ,<br>
preformulation composition may then be subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type* "<br>
described above containing from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 5tto<br>
about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.	 <br>
The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be advantageously coated or ptherise;; compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two       "<br>
14<br><br>
components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration "<br>
in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or-toT.<br><br>
be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or      ;<br>
coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as <br>
»<br>
shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be|<br>
advantageously incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous  <br>
solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured <br>
emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil<br>
as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending<br>
agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as	<br>
tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention<br>
give rise to a mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by	<br>
conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be<br>
prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by	<br>
enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be      <br>
resolved into their components enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the      <br>
formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as<br>
(-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by fractional<br>
crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separatiorj<br>
and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using<br>
-<br>
a chiral HPLC column.	<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on ahy"of| the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting* groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W.<br>

administration selected. Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients,<br>
including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants,	 <br>
sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral	 <br>
administration include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each   including immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), .. granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions,  and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, <br>
emulsions and suspensions.	 <br>
 vantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single!<br>
daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three .;<br>
or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can be	 <br>
administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via   <br>
transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be	 <br>
administered in the form of transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will,""<br>
of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen and <br>
dosage strength will need to be accordingly modified to obtain the desired therapeutic1]<br>
effects.	 <br>
More preferably, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drugs<br><br>
component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert;<br>
16<br><br>
carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can<br><br>
also be incorporated Into the mixture.

Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms are suitable in flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose and thej like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired.     j Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines using processes well described in the art.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamide-phenol, or polyethyl eneoxidepolyllysine substituted with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable" polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polyactic acid,-polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyeric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br><br><br><br>

Fluorescence measurement was performed against 0.9% NaCI in plasma (reference standard) using a plate reader (HTS7000plus, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt,     Germany). The half-life of the inhibitory potency of glutaminyl pyrrolidine or glutaminyl;,<br><br>
thiazolidine was calculated by plotting the enzyme activity versus reaction time.<br>
 For both compounds, no half-time could be determined. The substance is <x>nsidered to<br>
be stable in human plasma over 22 hours.       "<br>
Example 9:   Determination of DPIV inhibiting activity of glutaminyl pyrrolidine and<br>
glutaminyl thiazolidine after intravasal and oral administration to Wistar rats<br>
26<br><br>
Animals<br>
Male Wistar rats (Shoe: Wist(Sho)) with a body weight ranging between 250 and 350 g"<br>
were purchased from Tierzucht Schonwalde (Schdnwalde, Germany).	<br>
Housing conditions<br>
Animals were single-caged under conventional conditions with controlled temperature<br>
(22±2 °C) on a 12/12 hours light/dark cycle (light on at 06:00 AM). Standard pelleted<br>
chow (ssnifr Soest, Germany) and tap water acidified with HCI were allowed ad libitum<br>
Catheter insertion into carotid artery<br>
After zone week of adaptation at the housing conditions, catheters were implanted into<br>
the carotid artery of Wistar rats under general anaesthesia (i.p. injection of 0.25 ml/kg<br>
b.w. Rompun® [2 %], BayerVital, Germany and 0.5 ml/kg b.w. Ketamin 10, Atarost<br>
GmbH &amp; Co., Twistringen, Germany). The animals were allowed to recover for one<br>
week. The catheters were flushed with heparin-saline (100 lU/ml) three times per week<br>
In case of catheter dysfunction, a second catheter was inserted into the contra-lateral"*<br>
carotid artery of the respective rat. After one week of recovery from surgery, this animal<br>
was reintegrated into the study. In case of dysfunction of the second catheter, the<br>
animal was withdrawn from the study. A new animal was recruited and the experiments<br>
were continued in the planned sequence, beginning at least 7 days after catheter<br>
implantation.<br>
Experimental design	 <br>
To rats with intact catheter function were administered placebo (1 ml saline, 0.154 mow) ,<br>
or 100 mg/kg b.w. glutaminyl pyrrolidine or 100 mg/kg b.w. glutaminyl thiazolidine via;<br>
the oral and the intra-vasal (intra-arterial) route.<br>
After overnight fasting, 100 pi samples of heparinised arterial blood were collected at<br>
30, -5, and 0 min The test substance was dissolved freshly in 1.0 ml saline (0.154 rhbl/j)<br>
and was administered at 0 min either orally via %feeding tube (75 mm; Fine Science;<br>
Tools, Heidelberg, Germany) or via the intra-vasal route. In the case of oral<br>
administration, an additional volume of 1 ml saline was injected into the arterial catheter.<br>
In the case of intra-arterial administration, the catheter was immediately flushed with 30<br>
pi saline and an additional 1 ml of saline was given orally via the feeding tube.<br>
27<br><br>
After application of placebo or the test substance^, arterial blood samples were taken 2.5,5,7.5,10,15,20,40,60 and 120 min from the carotid catheter of the conscious unrestrained rats. All blood samples were collected into ice cooled Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, Hamburg, Germany) filled with 10 ul 1M sodium citrate buffr-(pH 3.0) for plasma DPIV activity measurement. Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged immediately (12000 rpm for 2 min, Hettich Zentrifuge EBA 12, Tuttlingen; Germany): The plasma fractions were stored on ice until analysis or were frozen at -20 °C until analysis. All plasma samples were labelled with the following data:<br>
•	Code number<br>
•	Animal Number<br>
•	Date of sampling<br>
•	Time of sampling<br>
Analytical Methods<br>
The assay mixture for determination of plasma DPIV activity consisted of 80 pi reagen|<br><br>
and 20 ul plasma sample. Kinetic measurement "of the formation of the yellow product 4<br>
nitroaniline from the substrate glycylprolyl-4-nitroaniline was performed at 390 nmfof.<br>
min at 30 °C after 2 min pre-incubation at the same temperature. The DPIV activity was<br>
expressed in mU/ml.<br>
Statistical methods<br>
Statistical evaluations and graphics were performed with PRISM9 3.02 (GraphPad<br>
Software, Inc.). All parameters were analysed in a descriptive manner including mean,<br>
and SD.<br>
Results<br>
The compounds glutaminyl pyrrolidine and glutaminyl thiazolidine in a dose of 100<br>
mg/kg b.w. vs. placebo inhibited plasma DPIV activity after oral and intra-vasal<br>
administration (see figures 1 and 2)<br>
Example 10: Dose escalation study in fatty Zuckerrats after oral administration of<br>
glutaminyl pyrrolidine<br>
28<br><br>
Animals<br>
N=30 male Zucker rats (fa/fa), mean age 11 weeks (5-12 weeks), mean body weight<br>
350 g (150-400 g), were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany).<br>
After delivery they were kept for &gt;12 weeks until nearly all fatty Zucker rats had the<br>
characteristics of manifest diabetes mellitus. A group of N=8 animals were recruited for<br>
testing three escalating doses of glutaminyl pyrrolidine vs. placebo (saline).<br>
Housing Conditions<br>
Animals were single-caged under standardized conditions with controlled temperature<br>
(22±2 °C) on a 12/12 hours light/dark cycle (lighfon at 06:00 AM). Sterile standard<br>
pelleted chow (ssniff® Soest, Germany) and tap water acidified with HCI were allowed<br>
ad libitum.<br>
Catheterization of Carotid Artery<br>
Fatty Zucker rats of 24-31 weeks (mean: 25 weeks) age, adapted to the housing<br>
conditions, were well prepared for the study.<br>
Catheters were implanted into the carotid artery of fatty Zucker rats under general<br>
anaesthesia (i.p. injection of 0.25 ml/kg b.w. Rompun® [2 %], BayerVital, Germany and<br>
0.5 ml/kg b.w. Ketamin 10, Atarost GmbH &amp; Co., Twistringen, Germany). The animals<br>
were allowed to recover for one week. The catheters were flushed with heparm-saline<br>
(100 lU/ml) three times per week.<br>
Experimental Design<br>
Placebo (1 ml saline, 0.154 mol/l) or escalating doses of glutaminyl pyrrolidine (5,15<br>
and 50 mg/kg b.w.) were administered to groups of N=8 fatty Zucker rats. 375 mg of<br>
glutaminyl pyrrolidine were dissolved in 1000 ul DMSO (E. Merck, Darmstadt; Germany<br>
[Dimethyl sulfoxide p.a.]).10 ml saline were added and 1 ml aliquots, each containing<br>
34.09 mg of glutaminyl pyrrolidine, were stored at -20 °C. For preparation of the test<br>
substance, dose dependent aliquots were diluted in saline.<br>
After overnight fasting, placebo or test substance were administered to the fatty Zucker rats via feeding tube orally (15 G, 75 mm; Fine Science Tools, Heidelberg, Germany) at -10 min An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 2 g/kg b.w. glucose (40 % solution,<br>
29<br><br>
B. Braun Melsungen, Melsungen, Germany) was administered at ±0 min via a second<br>
feeding tube. Venous blood samples from the tail veins were collected at-30 min, -15<br>
min, ±0 min and at 5,10,15,20,30,40, 60,90 and 120 min into 20 ul glass capillaries.<br>
which were placed in standard tubes filled with 1 ml solution for blood glucose<br>
measurement.<br>
All blood samples were labelled with the following data:<br>
•	Code number<br>
•	Animal Number<br>
•	Date of sampling<br>
•	Time of sampling<br>
Analytical Methods<br>
Glucose levels were measured using the glucose oxidase procedure (Super G Glucose<br>
analyzer; Dr. MQIIer GenMebau, Freital, Germany).<br>
Statistical methods<br>
Statistical evaluations and graphics were performed with PRISM* 3.02 (GraphPad<br>
Software, Inc.). All parameters were analysed in a descriptive manner including mean<br>
and SD.<br>
Effect of Medication on Glucose Tolerance<br>
The placebo treated diabetic Zucker rats showed a strongly elevated blood glucose<br>
excursion indicating glucose intolerance of manifest diabetes mellitus. Administration of<br>
5 mg/kg b.w. glutaminyl pyrrolidine resulted in a limited improvement of glucose<br>
tolerance in diabetic Zucker rats. Significant lowering of elevated blood glucose levels<br>
and improvement of glucose tolerance was achieved after administration of 15 mg/kg<br>
and 50 mg/kg b.w. glutaminyl pyrrolidine (see figure 3).<br>
