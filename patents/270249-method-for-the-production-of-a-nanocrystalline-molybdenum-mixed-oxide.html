				<td>The invention relates to a method for the production of a<br>
nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed oxide, the use of the<br>
molybdenum mixed oxide as catalyst for chemical conversions<br>
as well as a catalyst which contains the molybdenum mixed<br>
oxide.<br>
Until now, molybdenum mixed oxides have been obtained in the<br>
state of the art by precipitation methods, sol-gel methods or<br>
solid-state reactions.<br>
Molybdenum mixed oxides are used in the state of the art as<br>
catalyst for chemical conversions. Conversions of alkyl<br>
compounds or alkene compounds to acrolein or derivatives<br>
thereof as well as a conversion of acrolein to acrylic acid<br>
may be named here as examples. The molybdenum mixed oxide<br>
catalysts according to the state of the art often do not<br>
display a sufficient activity in these reactions.<br>
WO 2008/028681 and WO 2008/006565 Al disclose a method for<br>
the production of nanocrystalline metal oxides or mixed metal<br>
oxides. There is no indication in these documents that<br>
special nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed oxides which are<br>
particularly well-suited as catalyst in particular for the<br>
conversion of acrolein to acrylic acid can be produced with<br>
the method.<br>
A crystalline molybdenum mixed oxide can be obtained only<br>
with difficulty via conventional methods. Thus, G.A.<br>
Zenkovets et al., "The structural genesis of a complex<br>
(MoVW) 5O14 oxide during thermal treatments and its redox<br>
behaviour at elevated temperatures", Materials Chemistry and<br><br>
Physics, 103 (2007), 295-304, disclose that an <br>
mixed oxide obtained via spray drying has an amorphous<br>
structure. This mixed oxide is present in the form of large<br>
aggregates approximately 5 um in size. A partially<br>
nanocrystalline structure forms inside the aggregates due to<br>
subsequent calcining. A pure crystalline phase with<br>
crystallites more than 1000 nm in size forms only after<br>
prolonged thermal treatment at approximately 440°C. The<br>
production of a nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed oxide can<br>
thus be accomplished only with difficulty.<br>
It is clear from 0. Ovsiter et al., "Molybdenum oxide based<br>
partial oxidation catalyst Part 3", Journal of Molecular<br>
Catalysis A: Chemical 185 (2002), 291-303, that a molybdenum<br>
mixed oxide does not display well-crystallized particles<br>
after thermal treatment. A crystalline phase, however, was<br>
able to be observed during a conversion of acrolein to<br>
acrylic acid, i.e. a crystallization first takes place during<br>
the oxidation reaction. Such a catalyst thus has a sufficient<br>
activity only after a prolonged reaction period.<br>
A disadvantage of the molybdenum mixed oxides described in<br>
the state of the art is thus that a uniform particle size of<br>
the molybdenum mixed oxides cannot be obtained and a control<br>
of the crystallization, in particular with regard to the<br>
crystallite size, is not possible. The BET surface area of<br>
the molybdenum mixed oxides described in the state of the art<br>
is likewise mostly too small. A small particle size with as<br>
large as possible a BET surface area is desired, in<br>
particular for catalytic uses.<br>
The object of the present invention was thus the provision of<br>
a nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed oxide which, in catalytic<br>
conversions, in particular in a conversion of acrolein to<br>
acrylic acid, has an increased activity and selectivity.<br><br>
The object is achieved by a method for the production of a<br>
nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed oxide, comprising the steps<br>
of<br>
a) the introduction of a solution, suspension or<br>
slurry which contains a molybdenum starting<br>
compound and at least one further metal-containing<br>
starting compound, selected from a tungsten-<br>
containing and/or vanadium-containing starting<br>
compound, into a reaction chamber by means of a<br>
carrier fluid,<br>
b) a thermal treatment of the solution, suspension or<br>
slurry which contains the molybdenum starting<br>
compound and the at least one further metal-<br>
containing starting compound in a treatment zone by<br>
means of a pulsating flow at a temperature of from<br>
200 to 500°C,<br>
c) the formation of nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed<br>
oxide,<br>
d) the discharge of the nanocrystalline molybdenum<br>
mixed oxide obtained in steps b) and c) from the<br>
reactor.<br>
It was surprisingly found that a uniform particle size of the<br>
molybdenum mixed oxides can be obtained by the method<br>
according to the invention and a control of the<br>
crystallization, in particular with regard to the crystallite<br>
size, is achieved. The BET surface area was likewise able to<br>
be increased compared with the molybdenum mixed oxides known<br>
in the state of the art.<br>
The molybdenum mixed oxide obtained according to the<br>
invention is characterized by a crystallite size in the range<br>
of from 5 nm to 450 nm.<br><br>
The catalytic activity of a catalyst containing the<br>
molybdenum mixed oxide obtained according to the invention,<br>
in particular in the case of a conversion of acrolein to<br>
acrylic acid, was able to be increased by roughly IS compared<br>
with known conventional catalysts.<br>
By the term "mixed oxide" is meant within the meaning of the<br>
invention a mixed oxide that comprises two or more metals and<br>
constitutes a single chemical compound that can be expressed<br>
with a formula. This is to be distinguished accordingly from<br>
a pure (physical) mixture of several metal oxides.<br>
Preferably a molybdate, particularly preferably ammonium<br>
heptamolybdate tetrahydrate, is used as molybdenum starting<br>
compound. However, it is clear to a person skilled in the art<br>
in this field that other molybdates and molybdenum compounds<br>
known in the state of the art can also be used.<br>
In order to obtain a mixed oxide, at least one further metal-<br>
containing starting compound should be used. Tungstates<br>
and/or vanadates are preferred further compounds according to<br>
the present invention. The further starting compound ammonium<br>
metatungstate and/or ammonium metavanadate is particularly<br>
preferred. A combination of the two last named is most<br>
preferred.<br>
The molybdenum starting compound and the at least one further<br>
metal-containing starting compounds are preferably used<br>
together as solution, suspension or slurry. It is most<br>
preferred if the starting compounds are present in solution,<br>
in particular in aqueous solution. If necessary, the solution<br>
can be heated in order to achieve a complete dissolution of<br>
the starting compounds, in particular in the case of poorly<br>
soluble starting compounds. The solution of the starting<br>
compounds is advantageously heated to &gt; 50°C.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a solution of<br>
ammonium metatungstate, ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate<br>
and ammonium metavanadate is used in the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Prior to or during the introduction into the reaction<br>
chamber, a solution, suspension or slurry which contains at<br>
least one additional metal salt can be added to the solution,<br>
suspension or slurry which contains the molybdenum starting<br>
compound and the at least one further metal-containing<br>
starting compound. The at least one metal salt is preferably<br>
a copper salt or an iron salt or a combination of a copper<br>
and an iron salt.<br>
The addition of a solution, suspension or slurry containing<br>
metal salt to the solution, suspension or slurry which<br>
contains the molybdenum starting compound and the at least<br>
one further metal-containing starting compound brings about a<br>
doping of the resulting molybdenum mixed oxide with the<br>
corresponding metal. Any fine adjustments•for the respective<br>
desired catalytic function of the molybdenum mixed oxide can<br>
thereby be achieved.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a solution of<br>
ammonium metatungstate, ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate<br>
and ammonium metavanadate, to which a copper-salt solution is<br>
added, is used in the method according to the invention. The<br>
copper salt is preferably copper sulphate or copper acetate.<br>
In a further particularly preferred embodiment, a solution of<br>
ammonium metatungstate, ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate<br>
and ammonium metavanadate, to which a copper-salt and iron-<br><br>
salt solution is added, is used in the method according to<br>
the invention. The copper salt is preferably copper sulphate<br>
or copper acetate and the iron salt is preferably iron<br>
nitrate.<br>
It was surprisingly found that the method can be carried out<br>
at relatively low temperatures of from 200 to 500°C,<br>
particularly preferably from 250 to 450°C, particularly<br>
preferably from 300 to 400°C. Hitherto, preferred<br>
temperatures of more than 700°C, indeed up to 1400°C, were<br>
known in the state of the art. Quite particularly<br>
surprisingly, it was also found that the crystallization<br>
process of the molybdenum mixed oxide can be controlled in a<br>
targeted manner by the method according to the invention, in<br>
particular the size of the crystallites and the pore-size<br>
distribution of the corresponding molybdenum mixed oxides.<br>
This can further be advantageously influenced by the<br>
residence time in the flame or by the reactor temperature.<br>
The nanocrystalline molybdenum mixed oxide particles that<br>
form are prevented from agglomerating by the pulsating<br>
thermal treatment. Typically, the nanocrystalline particles<br>
are immediately transferred by the stream of hot gas into a<br>
colder zone, where some of the molybdenum mixed oxide<br>
crystallites are obtained with diameters of even less than<br>
2 0 nm.<br>
In the case of the thus-obtainable molybdenum mixed oxide<br>
crystallites, this leads to clearly increased BET surface<br>
areas of &gt; 1 m2/g, particularly preferably 2 to 10 m2/g and<br>
particularly preferably 3 to 7 m2/g. The BET surface area is<br>
determined using the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller method<br>
according to DIN 66132.<br>
In the method according to the invention, suspensions can be<br>
calcined within a very short period, typically within a few<br><br>
milliseconds, at comparatively lower temperatures than are<br>
usual with methods of the state of the art, without<br>
additional filtration and/or drying steps or without the<br>
addition of additional solvents. The molybdenum mixed oxide<br>
nanocrystallites that form have significantly increased BET<br>
surface areas and thus represent a molybdenum mixed oxide<br>
catalyst with increased reactivity, improved rate of<br>
conversion and improved selectivity, in particular with<br>
regard to a conversion of acrolein to acrylic acid.<br>
The nearly identical residence time of every molybdenum mixed<br>
oxide particle in the homogeneous temperature field created<br>
by the method results in an extremely homogeneous end product<br>
with narrow monomodal particle distribution. A device for<br>
carrying out the method according to the invention in the<br>
production of such monomodal nanocrystalline metal oxide<br>
powders is known for example from DE 101 09 892 Al. Unlike<br>
the device described there and the method disclosed there,<br>
the present method does not, however, require an upstream<br>
evaporation step in which the starting material, i.e. the<br>
molybdenum starting compound, is heated to an evaporation<br>
temperature.<br>
The molybdenum starting compound and the further starting<br>
compounds from which the molybdenum mixed oxides according to<br>
the invention are produced are inserted directly via a<br>
carrier fluid, in particular a carrier gas, preferably an<br>
inert carrier gas, such as for example nitrogen, etc., into<br>
so-called reaction chambers, i.e. into the combustion<br>
chamber. Attached exhaust side to the reaction chamber is a<br>
resonance tube with a flow cross-section which is clearly<br>
reduced compared with the reaction chamber. The floor of the<br>
combustion chamber is equipped with several valves for the<br>
entry of the combustion air into the combustion chamber. The<br>
aerodynamic valves are fluidically and acoustically matched<br><br>
with the combustion chamber and the resonance tube geometry<br>
such that the pressure waves, created in the combustion<br>
chamber, of the homogeneous "flameless" temperature field<br>
spread pulsating predominantly in the resonance tube. A so-<br>
called Helmholtz resonator forms with pulsating flow with a<br>
pulsation frequency of between 10 and 150 Hz, preferably 30<br>
to 110 Hz.<br>
Material is typically fed into the reaction chamber either<br>
with an injector or with a suitable two-component nozzle or<br>
in a Schenk dispenser.<br>
Preferably, the molybdenum starting compound is introduced<br>
into the reaction chamber in atomized form, with the result<br>
that a fine distribution in the region of the treatment zones<br>
is guaranteed.<br>
After the thermal treatment, the nanocrystalline molybdenum<br>
mixed oxides that form are immediately transferred into a<br>
colder zone of the reaction chamber, if possible by means of<br>
the carrier fluid, with the result that they can be separated<br>
and discharged in the colder zone. The yield of the method<br>
according to the invention is almost 100%, as all of the<br>
product that forms can be discharged from the reactor.<br>
Typically, the method is carried out at a pressure of between<br>
15 and 40 bar.<br>
A subject of the invention is furthermore the nanocrystalline<br>
molybdenum mixed oxide that can be obtained by the method<br>
according to the invention. It was found that the thus-<br>
obtainable nanocrystalline molybdenum oxide preferably has a<br>
crystallite size in the range of from 5 nm to 450 nm,<br>
preferably of from 10 nm to 400 nm, quite particularly<br>
preferably 15 to 250 nm, which, as already stated above, can<br><br>
preferably be set by the pulsation of the thermal treatment.<br>
The particle size can be determined by XRD or TEM.<br>
Furthermore, molybdenum oxide particles which have a BET<br>
surface area of preferably &gt; 1 nr/g, particularly preferably<br>
2 to 10 nr/g and particularly preferably 3 to 7 nr/g are<br>
obtained by the method according to the invention.<br>
The molybdenum mixed oxide obtained according to the<br>
invention is exceptionally suitable for use as catalyst, for<br>
example in the catalytic conversion of acrolein to acrylic<br>
acid.<br>
Acrylic acid or propenoic acid belongs to the unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids. Acrylic acid is a colourless chemical<br>
compound, with a pungent, vinegary odour, that can be mixed<br>
with water and is liquid at room temperature. Acrylic acid<br>
has a strong corrosive action and is flammable. Large-scale<br>
industrial production usually takes place by a two-stage<br>
oxidation of propylene with the aid of catalysts. In the<br>
first stage, propylene is converted with air to propenal<br>
(acrolein). The oxidation of propenal to acrylic acid takes<br>
place in the second stage. Its main use is polymerization to<br>
superabsorbent polymers (use e.g. in nappies), acrylate<br>
esters (which are in turn used for the production of<br>
polymers) and as comonomers in the production of polymer<br>
dispersions. The water-soluble polymerisates of acrylic acid<br>
are used as finishes and thickeners as well as coatings for<br>
solid dosage forms and as ointment bases. Polyacrylic acid<br>
ethyl ester has proved its worth as copolymerization partner<br>
for the production of weather-proof elastomers.<br>
A subject of the invention is thus also a catalyst which<br>
contains the molybdenum mixed oxide according to the<br><br>
invention. The catalyst can be a supported or an unsupported<br>
catalyst (bulk catalyst, extruded catalyst).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the molybdenum<br>
mixed oxide can be processed together with a suitable binder<br>
to an extrudate (tablets, shaped bodies, honeycomb bodies and<br>
the like). Any binder that is familiar to a person skilled in<br>
the art and appears suitable, in particular silicate<br>
materials, aluminium oxide, zirconium compounds, titanium<br>
oxide, as well as their mixtures, and materials such as e.g.<br>
cement, clay, silica/alumina, can be used as binders.<br>
Preferred binders are, among others, pseudoboehmite as well<br>
as siliceous binders such as colloidal silicon oxide or<br>
silica sol.<br>
In preferred developments of the invention, the molybdenum<br>
mixed oxide can furthermore be processed together with other<br>
components, preferably with a binder, particularly preferably<br>
with an organic binder, for example organic glues, polymers,<br>
resins or waxes, to a washcoat which can be applied to a<br>
metallic or ceramic support. Optionally, additional<br>
impregnating steps or calcining steps can take place.<br>
Preferably, the molybdenum mixed oxide obtained according to<br>
the invention is present as coating on a support. A preferred<br>
support material is steatite, steatite spheres are<br>
particularly preferred. The coating is preferably carried out<br>
in a fluidized bed coating device known per se to a person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a method for the<br>
conversion of acrolein to acrylic acid, wherein an above-<br>
defined catalyst is used.<br>
In the method, acrolein, preferably with oxygen, steam and<br>
nitrogen, is passed at 200 to 400°C over a bed of the<br><br>
catalyst according to the invention. An improvement with<br>
regard to acrolein conversion rate, acrylic acid selectivity<br>
and acrylic acid yield is apparent in the method according to<br>
the invention compared with a method which has been carried<br>
out with a catalyst according to the state of the art.<br>
The invention is described in more detail with reference to<br>
the following embodiment examples and the figures, which are<br>
not to be regarded as limitative. The device used corresponds<br>
largely to the device described in DE 101 09 892 Al, with the<br>
difference that the device used for carrying out the method<br>
according to the invention had no preliminary evaporator<br>
stage.<br>
There are shown in:<br>
Figure 1 the XRD spectrum of the molybdenum mixed oxide<br>
according to the invention obtained in Example 6<br>
Figure 2 the XRD spectrum of the doped mixed oxide<br>
according to the invention obtained in Example 7<br>
Embodiment examples:<br>
General<br>
The essential advantages of the preparation with the aid of<br>
the pulsation reactor are the reduction of the overall<br>
preparation time, the small outlay (only the reactor is<br>
needed) and the fact that there is no drying and treatment of<br>
the product. The desired BET surface areas, particle sizes<br>
and also the crystallinity of the material can be varied in<br>
one step by the pulsation reactor.<br>
The following methods were varied for the preparation of the<br>
mixed oxides:<br>
Example 1: MoWV variant 1<br>
Two solutions were produced for the production.<br>
For solution 1, 18 1 dist. H20 was placed in a steel drum and<br>
heated. 487.8 g ammonium metatungstate was added and<br>
dissolved. Once 70°C had been reached, 3300 g ammonium<br>
heptamolybdate tetrahydrate and 546.6 g ammonium<br>
metavandadate were added. Once the components had dissolved<br>
completely, 113.4 g antimony trioxide was added and the<br>
mixture stirred for 1 hour at 95°C. The solution was cooled<br>
to room temperature.<br>
Solution 2 was produced by dissolving 466.8 g copper sulphate<br>
in 2880 ml dist. H20 at room temperature. The two solutions<br>
were mixed at room temperature and stirred for approx. 1 h. A<br>
suspension formed.<br>
The solution was atomized in the pulsation reactor as<br>
follows: after a heating-up period, conditional on the<br><br>
equipment, of several hours, the suspension was sprayed at<br>
different reactor temperatures (380, 360, 400°C).<br>
Air was used as carrier gas. The BET surface areas of the<br>
obtained molybdenum mixed oxide were between 1 and 4 irr/g.<br>
Example 2: MoWV variant 2<br>
For the production, 11820 ml distilled H20 was introduced.<br>
3150.12 g ammonium heptamolybdate tetraydrate was added to<br>
this and dissolved. Continuous stirring was carried out<br>
during the whole production process.<br>
822.24 g ammonium metatungstate was then added and dissolved.<br>
After subsequent heating to approx. 80°C, 585.6 g ammonium<br>
metavanadate was then added and the mixture heated further to<br>
100°C. This temperature was maintained for 5 hours, then the<br>
solution was cooled to room temperature.<br>
444 g ammonium acetate was then added, also at room<br>
temperature.<br>
Half of the 5 kg batch was doped with iron and copper.<br>
For this, 1.86 g copper acetate and 4.14 g iron nitrate were<br>
dissolved in 120 ml dist. H20 in each case and then added to<br>
the solution.<br>
The solution was heated for 12 h under reflux. A clear,<br>
orange-red solution formed.<br>
This solution was atomized doped and undoped into the<br>
pulsation reactor at 380°C using air as carrier gas. A grey<br>
powder with BET surface areas of 3-4 mz/g formed.<br>
Example 3: MOWV variant 3<br>
11820 ml dist. H20 was placed in a drum. 3150.12 g ammonium<br>
heptamolybdate tetrahydrate was added to this, then heated<br>
and left until it had completely dissolved.<br>
822.24 g ammonium metatungstate was then added and dissolved.<br>
The mixture was then heated to approx. 80°C, then 585.6 g<br>
ammonium metavanadate was added and the mixture heated<br>
further to 100°C. This temperature was maintained for 5 hours<br>
and then cooled to room temperature.<br>
After cooling to room temperature, 444 g ammonium acetate was<br>
added. Continuous stirring was carried out during the whole<br>
production process.<br>
Doping:<br>
The batch was doped with iron and copper. For this, 3.72 g<br>
copper acetate and 8.28 g iron nitrate were dissolved in 240<br>
ml dist. H20 in each case and then added to the solution.<br>
Atomization + results:<br>
The solution was atomized in normal air in the pulsation<br>
reactor.<br>

Example 8 (production of coated catalysts)<br><br>
A fluidized bed coating device was used to carry out the<br>
coating.<br>
The steatite spheres were coated with the various mixed oxide<br>
active materials from Examples 5 to 7 under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
22.22 g of the powder was weighed into a measuring cylinder,<br>
made into a slurry with 500 ml dist. H20. The resulting<br>
suspension was stirred intensively. 8.89 g binder was then<br>
added and the mixture stirred for 1 h on a magnetic stirrer.<br>
The "coating" of the produced suspension took place on a<br>
weighed-in sample of 80 g steatite spheres of (2-4 mm) ,<br>
wherein the active material charge was 20% (50 g powder per<br>
200 g steatite spheres) . The catalyst was then dried in air<br>
at 110°C.<br>
Example 9 (determination of the catalytic performance data of<br>
the catalysts)<br>
21 g catalyst (i.e. the above-described coated steatite<br>
spheres), diluted with 350 g steatite spheres with a diameter<br>
of 4.5 mm to avoid hotspots, was poured into a 120-cm long<br>
reaction tube with an internal diameter of 24.8 mm to a<br>
length of 105 cm. The reaction tube was in a liquid salt bath<br>
which was able to be heated to temperatures of up to 500°C.<br>
In the catalyst bed there was a 3 mm protective tube with an<br>
integrated thermocouple via which the catalyst temperature<br>
over the complete catalyst combination was able to be<br>
displayed.<br>
To determine the catalytic performance data, acrolein was put<br>
into the gas phase by means of a saturator. An air-inert gas<br>
mixture was passed through the saturator in such a way and<br><br>
the thermostat temperature of the saturator set such that an<br>
acrolein content of 5 vol.-% in the feed gas resulted. The<br>
reactor feed consisted of a mixture of 7 vol.-% 0, 10 vol.--<br>
steam and the remainder N;. The acrolein charge was 150 Nl/lh<br>
at most.<br>
The acrolein conversion rate and the acrylic acid selectivity<br>
were determined at an average catalyst temperature of 250°C.<br>
The results of the tests with the catalysts which contain the<br>
active material according to the examples named in the table<br>
are listed in Table 1.<br>
The ascertained results demonstrate an improvement of the<br>
catalysts according to the invention with regard to acrolein<br>
conversion rate, acrylic acid selectivity and acrylic acid<br>
yield compared with a catalyst according to the state of the<br>
art.<br>
