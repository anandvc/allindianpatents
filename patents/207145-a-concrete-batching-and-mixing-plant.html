FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved concrete batching and mixing plant comprises of a pan mixer , jjarticularly electronically controlled pan type concrete mixer which is useful in mixing particularly, but not exclusively, RMC grade concrete by using either cement or cement with an admixer , and for using fly ash in making concrete.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, a batching plant that is an apparatus for producing concrete is equipment for mixing cement, water, sand, rough sand, mixer agent and the like for the material of the concrete measured in a predetermined composition for producing the concrete that is kept in non-solid condition, and has been widely used in a civil construction, a dam construction, a green concrete factory, a concrete secondary factory or the like.<br>
Modern construction practices impose more severe constraints on concrete quality every year. Especially, concrete when freshly mixed is tested and measured for different desired qualities and standards pursuant to imposed and specified quality control standards. These standards include may include water content, both compressive and flexural strength after a prescribed number of days, aggregate shape, air content, and uniformity, etc. If the quality standards of the concrete produced vary statistically above or below the prescribed standard mean or inconsistency in the mixing affect the quality of the construction.<br>
It is generally agreed that higher strength concrete can be reached in<br>
a shorter period of time by better mixing action and accurate<br>
water/cement (W/C) ratios. A shorter period of time by better mixing<br>
action and accurate water/cement (W/C) ratios of concrete, mixed in<br>
conventional tilting drum mixers do not reach uniformity as quickly as<br>
the	mixer	used	in	this	invention.<br>
Because of the large quantity of concrete that can be produced by the<br>
Contractor in a day, the contractor faces great financial risk if many<br>
days pass before he realizes the concrete he is producing is testing<br>
outside of specification mean . It is being intended to show how<br>
important it is for the contractor to maintain quality control on the<br>
concrete he produces. It is imperative that the contractor use batching<br>
and mixing equipment capable of delivering uniformly mixed concrete<br>
to	precision	construction	specifications.<br>
Conventionally, a batcher plant that is an apparatus for producing concrete is equipment for mixing cement, water, sand, rough sand,<br><br>
3<br>
mixer agent and the like for the material of the concrete measured in a<br>
predetermined composition for producing the concrete that is kept in<br>
non-solid condition, and has been widely used in a dam construction,<br>
a civil construction, a green concrete factory, a concrete secondary<br>
factory	or	the	like.<br>
Further, many of the mixing and batching plants utilize rotating and tilting drum mixers located high overhead so they can tilt and gravity feed the mixed concrete into the hauling units. The mixer itself is belt fed with aggregates that are gravity fed through weighing hoppers to maintain precise concrete constituent proportions. This produces several undesirable constructional features, which complicate the erection and subsequent operation of such plants.<br>
First the feeding belt is usually gravity fed from overlying weighing hoppers. Thus, considerable weight must be supported at substantial heights from the ground on such plants which necessitates complex constructions which additionally requires large space to erect the plant.<br>
Also, because the rotating mixer drums are supported high in the air, if the more desirable gravity feed of cement is used with the rotating mixer drum, the cement silo must be elevated even higher in the air. Therefore the resulting silo and structure requires concrete foundations which also take-up considerable space. To save height, and in lieu of gravity feed from the silo to the cement batcher, many manufacturers of conventional concrete plants use cement screws or air slides to convey the cement into the mixer. Most contractors agree these cement-conveying schemes are undesirable.<br>
In using tilting drum mixers which are open in front for discharge and open in the back for loading the concrete constituents into the mixer, it is very difficult to suppress the dust that results from the loading operation and complex constructions and equipments are required in operating tilting drum mixers.<br>
Finally, rotating/tilting drum mixers are relatively slow in delivering desired amounts of thoroughly and uniformly mixed concrete and are not suitable for mixing admixers or cement substitutes such as fly ash because of the lack of forced mixing. Moreover, when cement substitutes are used such as fly ash or admixers, the concrete tends to be sticky which again impedes rapid discharge.<br>
The consistency of concrete depends upon the proportions of aggregates, cement and water used, and although it is usual in the preparation of high grade concrete to weigh the various aggregates<br><br>
4<br>
and the cement, and to weigh or measure volumetrically the water, it is very difficult, as anyone who has had experience of concrete mixing will recognize, to obtain the correct consistency of the concrete mix. This is due to the variable quantity of water present in the aggregates, particularly the fine aggregate or sand, unless these are dried beforehand, which is a very expensive operation.<br>
In the conventional boom scrapper system of storing aggregates, aggregates have to be filled above the discharge gates to make the plant run. The height of the discharge gate is between 1.5 to 2 meters above the ground level hence huge amount of aggregates are required to commission the plant and this in turn requires huge investment. Since the aggregates are stored on the open ground lots of aggregates are lost as it sinks into the ground.<br>
So it is desired to have a Bins system where the aggregates are stored in an enclosed bin and in the respective bin, thereby reducing the investment costs and is fed in a continuous manner with the help of a bin loading shovel.<br>
So what is desired is now to design a concrete batching and mixing plant which is simple in construction , do not take up lot of area and consistently delivering high quality concrete where the dosing, mixing and discharges are rapid. More particularly a concrete batching and mixing plant comprises a concrete mixer with a simplified construction in which the material in the pan is thoroughly stirred, getting a rubbing action when fly ash is used, electronically controlled water batching and aggregate loading to ensure the concrete quality, and the operations such as loading, weighing, including the operation of discharge, are thorough and very rapid.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to make a concrete batching and mixing plant which is simple in construction and can be erected in small area in comparison to conventional batching plants. Another object of the present invention is to provide RMC quality mix within seconds, as the loading and mixing time in the present invention are in Seconds, and there by reduce the operating cost.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a forced type of mixing, and thereby certain quantities of cement can also be saved to get the similar strength while retaining the good quality and consistency of concrete.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a means for continuous storage and dispensing of the different aggregates without getting the aggregates mix up together in a continuous operation thereby also saving the space for storage.<br><br>
5<br>
Yet another object is to use Admixers to get a good quality mix which could give all the advantages of using an Admixer, while providing consistency in mixing.<br>
Yet another object of the invention to make use of flyash in a batching and mixing plant, which is now been propagated in the industry giving the distinct advantage to the Contractors of using flyash, in lieu of saving certain quantities of cement, thereby reducing the cost of concrete,<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the mixing time greatly thereby operating in a continuous manner which can deliver much higher output in a shorter time and to reduce the total power consumption of a given capacity of the mixing plant, Yet another object is to provide high quality consistent concrete ideal for mixing stiff mixes for interlock tiles, hollow blocks, ore cast members, etc, where mix quality is of utmost importance, and to get a required strength of a block or tile.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to suppress the dust that results from the loading operation of cement or the like and to avoid complex constructions and equipments are required in operating tilting drum mixers.<br>
Other objects and advantages will become apparent to persons skilled in the art and familiar with the background art available from careful reading of this specification.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a concrete batching and mixing plant, comprises of mainly a pan type mixer assembly, a hopper for loading different aggregates or cement or admixers or cement substitutes, a load cell and its frame for weighing the aggregates in the hopper , an electronically controlled water dosing system which dispenses water to an accuracy of 0,1 liter, a winch assembly for lifting and loading the aggregates in to the pan mixer from the hopper, a three compartment bins for storing and continuously feeding different types of aggregates in to the hopper, a bin loading shovel for loading aggregates into the three comrjartment bins, a convever for cement loading. which is essentially simple and smaller in construction while able to deliver a higher capacity of consistent concrete continuously. The invention uses a pan type mixer which forcibly mixes the aggregates, water and cement or cement substitutes along with or without admixers. The whole system except the bin loading shovel is connected to a central computerized control panel and the whole system made possible to operate from the control panel.<br><br>
6<br>
Now it is made possible to make concrete of high quality in a continuous manner as the mixing time of the pan mixer used in the present invention is only 30 seconds. The Three compartment bins and the bin loading shovels are provided to reduce the feeding time of the aggregates and the cement. It may be understood that optionally a screw conveyer can also be used to load the three compartment bins and also forms part of the invention.<br>
According to the present invention a concrete mixer particularly but not exclusively to make use of fly ash and admixers which is essentially of pan type comprises, a cylindrical outer frame to form the sides of the pan, a flat base made of steel and a wear plate attached on the base, a centrally mounted shaft in which the mixing arms are attached, the shaft are driven through a geared motor, a housing assembry for the shaft to prevent the wear and tear to the shaft, having mixing blade attached on the ends of the mixing arms with the help of pads, mixing arms are positioned in such a manner to get maximum mixing action through out the periphery of the pan. and a cover containing opening for aggregates , water and an optional inspection gate.<br>
The construction according to the present invention also permits of<br>
extremely rapid discharge of the material and to this end the invention<br>
comprises a pan mixer having in combination a stationary pan with a<br>
flat bottom, a mixer assembly supported from below the pan,<br>
concentrically disposed in the pan and mounted for orbital rotation<br>
therein, a discharge port 30 at optionally any side of the bottom of<br>
the	door slidably disposed to control the discharge port and<br>
means for operating the door.<br>
In accordance with the invention the use of special additives in concrete or substitutes for cement such as fly ash or reinforcing materials such as iron fibbers are now made possible by use of these pan mixers. This achievement is particularly due to the simple construction and the different orientation of the mixing arms along with blades and the forced mixing effect it generates during mixing. Also the accurate dosing due to the additional features such as a load cell controlled weighing aggregate and water batching made it possible to get consistent mixing and extremely good quality concrete which overcomes the problems in the conventional mixers.<br>

From this panel the pneumatic cylinders 64 (fig, 2) are connected by pneumatic pipes 65 (fig, 2) The aggregates are directly discharged in the Mixer's Hopper 5 (fig.l) from the gates 61(fig.2) The required quantity of different Aggregates can be preset in the Micro-Controller based Control Panel. The set quantity of each Aggregate is discharged from the respective gate of the different bins 63-65 (fig, 2) into the Hopper 5 (fig.l) and as soon as this is completed, when the display turns zero and the second Aggregate unloads, and similarly for the 3rd Aggregate, A cumulative figure of the total weight filled in Hoppe 5 (fig, l)can be read after all the aggregates have been unloaded.<br>
The Bin loading shovel 9 (fig.l) essentially consists of a base frame 66 (fig.l) which is fabricated out of mild steel channels. At the centre of the frame a pipe 67(fig,l) is fixed on which the main assembly 68(fig,l) is welded, This main assembly consists of a bearing housing &amp; main gear (not shown) fixed on the assembly, the main shaft (not shown) and the operators cabins 10 (fig.l)base frame 72.(fig.l) In the operator's cabin 10 (fig.l) the hydraulic power pack consisting of hydraulic pump, four station hydraulic valve bank, hydraulic hoses strainers/filters, pressure gauge, hydraulic motor on whose shaft the pinion is fixed, operators chair etc which are known to the skilled in the art (not shown) . On one side of the main assembly a boom 69 (fig, 1) is fixed goes up and down motion, is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder 70 (fig.l)fixed at the center of the boom and the other end of the cylinder fixed at the base of the main assembly. At the end of the boom a second boom called a dip slick is fixed by means of pins made out of alloy steel. These pins move the bashes fixed on the booms, At one end of the date slick a bucket is fixed by means of pins &amp; operated by hydraulic cylinders. The movement of the dipstick is also by hydraulic cylinders. The rotational motion of the complete assembly is by hydraulic motor, which went rotates around the main gear gives the circular motion to the main frame assembly along with the cabin. Different Aggregates would be stacked/Dumped on three sides of the shovel and this shovel shall load the Bins which is located on the 4th side of the shovel. It must be understood that instead of the bin loading shovel 9 (fig.l), optionally screw conveyers can also be used to load the aggregates into the three compartment bins. There is provided a cement screw conveyor which is fabricated out of mild steel pipe to carry the cement bags. On the ends of the pipe to bearing housings are fixed which houses the bearings (not shown)and a main shaft of appropriate length has the screw flight made out of mild steel plate. The screw flight is welded onto the main shaft. At the one end of the pipe a hopper is fixed so that the cement bags can<br><br>
12<br>
be opened and unloaded into this hopper. At the other end at 180 degrees a discharge chute is fixed such that the cement is discharged directly into the mixer's hopper. This shall be of suitable capacity with on inlet and one outlet and one inspection gate. Screw shaft shall be mounted on ball bearing at both ends with proper sealing plates.<br>
Cement can also be fed directly through the Silo below which this screw conveyor can be placed or cement bags manually opened can be fed in the Hopper of the screw conveyor (not shown) from where it would fall in the mixer Hopper 5 (fig.l). The operation of the screw conveyor would be controlled by the control circuit in the Electronic Batching System.<br>
This Plant essentially consists of 3 Modules; Pan Type Mixer 1 (fig.l), Computerized 3 Compartment Bins 7(fig.l), Bin loading shovel 9 (fig.l) and cement screw conveyor and the optional additional feature comprises Admixer,<br>
Dozer (not shown), and printer (not shown). The whole system is connected and operated through a centralized computerized control panel (not shown) except the bin loading shovel 9 (fig.l) which is operated from the operator cabin 10 (fig.l)provided on the bin loading shovel 9(fig.l) .<br>
The use of special additives in concrete are made possible in these pan mixers by positioning and orientation of the blades and the forced mixing effect it generates during mixing with respect to the special construction of the pan mixer. To dose admixers and fly ash which is very light in nature and cannot be mixed in any drum type mixers, since during mixing of concrete with fly ash, due to the lightness of the flyash it gets stuck to the outer periphery of the drum and the dosing is wasted. Since the wear plates have minimum clearance between the base and the arm, the materials are scrapped and also due to forced mixing the ingredients; fly ash or special additives can be mixed in the plant to get a consistent and high quality concrete.<br>
Now it is made possible to make concrete of high quality in a continuous manner as the mixing time of the pan mixer used in the present invention is only 30 seconds. The Three compartment bins and the bin loading shovels are provided to reduce the feeding time of the aggregates and the cement.<br>
It is also made advantageous in cleaning of the mixer which usually is cumbersome due to the simple construction of the mixer of the invention and the cleaning is done by simply mixing the aggregates along with water after completion of concrete A suitable Dot Matrix Printer with  interface  with  the  control panel  shall     optionally  be<br><br>
13<br>
provided. Additionally suitable Admixture Dozer may optionally be provided on the pan mixer.<br>
It is now apparent from the above description that additional advantages of quick erect batching plants over conventional boom scrapper type of arrangement are as follows,<br>
1)	No idle materia! (aggregates) required to fill to a minimum level of the gates of the bulkhead.<br>
2)	Financial savings towards storing minimum amount of aggregates.<br>
3)	Amount of aggregates can be dumped as per the dally schedule of concrete.<br>
4)	Whole plant with storage place can be accommodated only in an area of 30' x 50', leaving a large space for other activities.<br>
5)	Aggregates can be dumped at the shovel base, and hence total material could be used, leaving negligible amount of aggregates being wasted.<br>
6)	Only two operators can operate the plant.<br>
7)	The discharge height below the Pan CGuld be provided as per requirement.<br>
8)	Very simple and user friendly panels giving GOOD and consistent quality of concrete.<br>
9)	Pan type of mixers is ideal for use of additives like fly ash, micro silica and other types of admixer's.<br>
10)Special!y designed replaceable Wear plates, and wear pads to ensure minimum down time for replacement,<br>
11) Almost no breakdown of bin loading shovel as compared to frequent ad justments and maintenance-required in a boom scrapper assembly.<br>
12)Dismantling, transporting and re-erection cost is minimum, as there is minimum amount of civil work involved.<br><br>
