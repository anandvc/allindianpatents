				<td>The invention relates to an auto-dipper, which dips the light when the oncoming vehicle's light fall on the vehicles coming from the opposite side.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
It has been experienced that most of the highway accidents at night occur because drivers do not apply dipper and the glare of the high beam of the oncoming vehicle blinds the driver.<br>
The object of this invention is to obviate this drawback by providing an automatic dipper, which dips the high beam with the light falling on the vehicle from the oncoming vehicle.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides an auto-dipper comprising: at least one light sensor,<br>
the output of said sensor is connected to a timer integrated circuit (TIC) through intensity control device,<br>
the output of said timer integrated circuit (TIC) is connected to a switching transistor to activate the relay,<br>
the said relay is connected to low and high beam lights,<br>
the arrangement between sensor, TIC, switch and the relay being such that when TIC is activated, the said switch energizes the relay<br>
 and thereby dip the light from high beam to low beam whenever  the light from the oncoming vehicle falls on the said sensor.<br><br>
 The said light sensor is a light dependent resistor.<br>
The said intensity control device is a zener diode to activate the TIC only when the light falling on the sensor is above threshold intensity.<br>
A flip-flop circuit is provided between said TIC and relay to flicker the low and high beam, as a signal for pass.<br>
The said flip-flop circuit is astable multi-vibrator consisting of two RC coupled amplifiers. Each amplifier is connected to the input of the other in such a way that when one amplifier is conducting the other is in a cut off state automatically.<br>
The switching action between the two amplifiers is due to charging and discharging of the condensers through respective resistances in said astable multi-vibrator circuit and the rate of switching is decided by the values of said condensers and resistance in the circuit.<br>
A double contact switch is provided to extend power supply to the TIC and flip-flop circuit.<br>
A protection device is provided in the power supply to prevent damages to the circuit due to the wrong polarity. The said protective device is a diode. Reference to the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure I shows an electronic circuit for dipping the light coming from the oncoming vehicle, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the astable multi-vibrator, according to this invention.<br>
The circuit shown in the figure 1 consists of at least one light sensor (S). The said sensor is connected to timer integrated circuited (TIC) through a zener diode (D3). The said sensor is a light dependent resistance, whose resistance decreases when light falls on the sensor and the resistance increases when no light falls on the sensor. When the light intensity falling on the sensor (S) is above ,threshold intensity, overcome the bias of zener diode and voltages applied to the timer integrated circuit becomes about one-third of the applied voltages, TIC is triggered and it output is increased high enough to switch on<br>
the switching transistor (T3). When the transistor (T3) is switched on it energizes the relay (RL1) and its contact N/O is made, connecting power supply to the filament of low beam. Thus a vehicle automatically comes on dipper mode. When the oncoming vehicle passes off resistance of the sensor (S) gradually increases, as. as 10 mega ohms and output of the TIC becomes so low which can no itch on transistor (T3) and relay (RL1) is de-energized. In this de-energized state of relay, the contacts of the relay change over and now power supply is connected to high beam filaments through contacts N/C and contacts N/O becomes open, disconnecting the power supply from low beam filaments. So, in the absence of light on the sensor (S), the vehicle is on high beam automatically.<br>
In order to take permission to overtake a vehicle at night, a light signal is given in which high and low beam of headlight is switched on alternatively. This is achieved by pressing a double contact switch (S-l a and S-l b). When SI-a is enclosed, it triggers pin of TIC is short circuited to ground through SI-a and the output of the TIC becomes high irrespective of light conditions. At the same time switch Sl-b connects the biasing resistance R-5 to the base of transistor T-1. Thus, transistor (T -1 &amp; T -2) start working in an astable mode as a multi vibrator (MV) (flip-flop circuit) and collector of both these transistors go high and low alternately at a frequency 0.8 Hz which is determined by the value of capacitors (C3 and C4) and resistors (R4 &amp; R5).<br>
Astable multi-vibrator is a two stage circuit with each stage controlling the conduction characteristics of the other one and is shown in figure 2. It consists essentially of two RC coupled amplifiers with output of each coupled to the input of the other and operates in such a way that when the first amplifier is conducting, the second amplifier is in cut off state in the first stage. During the<br>
second stage, the first amplifier is in cut off state and the second amplifier is conducting. This switching action takes place automatically once the switch S 1 is closed. Switching ON/OFF in turn is due to the condensers C3 &amp; C4, charging and discharging through resistances R4 and R5 respectively. The rate of switching action is decided by the values of C3 &amp; R4 and C4 &amp; R5 respectively.<br>
The collector if Transistor (Tl) is connected to the output pin of the TIC. Hence the output pin of the TIC also goes high and low along with the collector of transistor (Tl) resulting switching ON and OFF Relay (RL1) to give dimming and brightening effect to the head light<br>
If the device has be put conveniently under the bonnet, in that case connections of S-l switch can be brought to a switch at the dashboard.<br>
FITMENT<br>
Sensor can be connected with shortest possible coaxial cable to the device and it should be better put at the right hand top corner of the windscreen so as to enable it to get maximum light of the oncoming vehicle. The sensor be housed in a plastic dark deep case so as to avoid stray lights from streets.<br>
The main unit can be located conveniently under the bonnet or under the dashboard of the vehicle. In buses and trucks we found during trials that it is more convenient to put it under the bonnet where as in Maruti cars, it is very convenient to install it under the steering wheel next to the Fuse Box. But in Ambassador and Fiat, its fitting under the bonnet is more suitable.<br>
Protection against wrong connection<br>
A diodes (Dl &amp; D2) have been provided for the protection of the circuit against the wrong polarity which may occur inadvertently during connections of power supply for carrying out test. There may be occasion like major repairing or service of the vehicle fitted with the auto dipper of the present invention when driver or a person has to remove the auto dipper. At the time of reconnections if wrong polarity is connected by the driver or a person, a damage to components like ICs and transister is likely to occur at occasion. To avoide damage against such wrong connections a DIODE (A 17) has been provided for the protection. This is a common practice in all sophisticated electronic devices.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
