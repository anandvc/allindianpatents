COMPUTER INPUT DEVICE TRACKING<br>
SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM<br>
Field of the invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to computer input devices.<br>
[0002] In particular, this invention relates to a computer input device having<br>
a plurality of tracking points and an imagmg device to allow entry of three-<br>
dimensional (3D), six-degrees-of-freedom data into a computer or gaming<br>
device.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
[0003] At present, the main input devices for comters are the keyboard<br>
and a pointer device commonly called a "mouse". For computer gaming<br>
purposes, additional devices such as joystics and gaming consoles with<br>
specialized buttons are available to give more input choices to the user in<br>
the game's virtual environment However, these are two-dimensional input<br>
devices used for entering 3D information. More recently, "computer<br>
interface appanels" such as gaming globes, actually worn by gamers are<br>
used to input their choice of movements into the computer games.<br>
[0004] Despite this plethora of input devices, no satisfactory device exists to<br>
accept the desired movements in sword fighting, or racquet, club or bat-<br>
swinging movements for certain computer games. Another possible<br>
application is that of symphony-conducting baton movements or the waving<br>
of a "magic wand' to perform magical thicks in games. The combined use of<br>
cureor control keys and rolling of trackballs do not satisfactorily convey the<br>
user's intended movements for the virtual object or character XXX controls in<br>
some computer games.<br>
[0005] In addition, other applications beyond the realm of computer games<br>
such as computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing<br>
(CAD/CAM) work require three-dimensional (3D)  input when modifying XXX 3D<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>

renditions of designs. Current input devices do not allow ease of use of<br>
such applications.<br>
[0006] Therefore, a need clearly exists for an intuitive, XXX and XXX<br>
input device that enables representation and input of 3D movements by<br>
users into computer and gaming devices.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007] The present invention seeks to provide an input device with three-<br>
dimensional six-degrees-of-freedom data input for a computer said input<br>
device comprising an arrangement of one array of tracking points to define<br>
a first axis, a second array of tracking points to define a second axis or<br>
plane orthogonal to the first axis with distances between the tracking points<br>
carefully selected such that a two-dimensional image of the tracking points<br>
captured by an imaging device can be used by a processor to determine<br>
the position and orientation of  the input device in three-dimensional space<br>
using a provided algorithm.<br>
[0008] Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention provides an input<br>
device comprising a wand with a cross piece, both wand and cross piece<br>
having a plurality of tracking points, at least one imaging device, at least<br>
one lighting means, and at least a processor.<br>

[0013] FIG. 4 shows two embodiments of the wand of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
[0014] A detailed description of the present invention will now be given in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the following<br>
description, details are provided to describe the preferred embodiment. It<br>
shall be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the invention may<br>
be practiced without such details. Some of those details may not be<br>
described at length so as not to obscure the invention.<br>
[0015] It is an object of the present invention to provide an input device for<br>
computer and gaming devices that accept 3D input.<br>
[0016] It is another object of the present invention to provide an input device<br>
for computer and gaming devices that allow the reproduction of intended<br>
3D, 6 DOF movements of virtual objects in the virtual environment. This<br>
type of movement input may be performed with minimal processor<br>
demands so that the present invention can be used in simpler, smaller or<br>
Iess expensive computers and gaming devices and not require too much<br>
processor resources from other concurrently-running processes.<br>
[0017] The terms "computer" and gaming devices' include, but are not<br>
limited to any computing device that require 3D input such as CAD/CAM<br>
workstations, "personal computers", dedicated computer gaming consoles<br>
and devices, personal digital assistants, and dedicated processors for<br>
processing images captured by the present invention.<br>
[0018] There are many advantages of the preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention. One advantage of the preferred embodiment is that swordlighting<br>
thrusts panles, golf drives, or racquet and bat swinging movements<br>
desired by users in the virtual environment of computer games can now be<br>
tracked and represented with the present invention.<br>
[0019] Another advantage is that hitherto unachievable input modaXXX for<br>
applications such as painting and sculpting strokes for virtual artistry.- or<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>

even precise manipulations of surgical instruments in telemedicine or<br>
surgical training, can now be realized with the present invention.<br>
[0020] The invention includes an input device using an arrangement<br>
comprising a first array of tracking points to define a first axis, a second<br>
array of tracking points to define a second axis or plane orthogonal to the<br>
first axis, with the distances between the points carefully selected such that<br>
a two-dimensional image of the tracking points can be used to detennine<br>
the position and orientation of the input device in three-dimensional space.<br>
[0021] Rsferring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment in accordance with the<br>
present invention is illustrated. The array should not be seen to be limited<br>
to the embodiments described. One element of the preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention is the input device is the wand 101, a longitudinal<br>
device that is substantially straight having a handle end 100 and a<br>
reference end 103. The user manipulates the wand by grasping it<br>
substantially the handle end.<br>
[0022] A cross piece 120 is orthogonally disposed near the reference end of<br>
the wand, in the preferred embodiment, the plane of the cross piece is<br>
substantially planar to the longitudinal axis of the wand. The cross piece of<br>
the preferred embodiment is a substantially straight piece of material<br>
although cross pieces in the shape of the letter 1 or in form of XXX or<br>
polygone may also be used.<br>
[0023] Disposed on the wand, on its reference end, is a first plurality of<br>
tracking points. A second plurality of tracking points is also disposed on the<br>
cross piece. These tracking points 110 may be active light emitters or<br>
passive light reflectors.<br>
[0024] In the case where active light emitters are used for the tracking<br>
points, the emitters should be capable of emitting light in all directions. This<br>
is so that the tracking points can be captured from all orientations of the<br>
wand by an imaging device, an element of the present invention, as long as<br>
they are not obscured and are within the field of view of the imaging device.<br>
[0025] The wavelengths of light usable range from infrared wavelengths,<br>
through visible light to ultra-violet light.<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>

[0026] In the preferred embodiment, the tracking points are passive infrared<br>
reflectors and form a XXX arrangement. The preferred shape of most of<br>
thcse tracking points is that of a globe or ball to maximize reflection of light.<br>
The exception is the tracking point of the wand nearest the handle and ( the<br>
"last" tracking point). Instead of being in a globe or half globe shape, this<br>
tracking point is only slightly domed. For most applications, the wand is not<br>
more than 30 cm long, a length that caters to a wide range of users. There<br>
are at least two tracking points on the wand, with three points being<br>
preferable, in a linear arrangement. There are two tracking points at either<br>
end of the cross piece which is preferably about 6 cm long (FIG. 1).<br>
[0027] Other elements of the present invention include at least one lighting<br>
means 150 providing light in the preferred wavelength range and at least<br>
one suitable imaging device 130 such as a camera with complementary<br>
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) or charge-coupled device (CCD)<br>
sensore. In the preferred embodiment, one lighting means and one imaging<br>
device is used and the imaging device is connected to a processor.<br>
[0028] In operation, the user grasps the wand of the present invention end<br>
XXX it as if he is handling the virtual devicc of choice. The light from the <br>
LIGHTING source is reflected from the passive tracking points and is captured<br>
as bright spots by the imaging device or camera. The imaging then in turn<br>
transmits the image to the processor.<br>
[0029] The present rnvention works within the field of view and in line of<br>
sight of the imaging device or camera. Thus, the local position for both the<br>
lighting means and the imaging means is in close proximity to the display<br>
screen of the computer or gaming device with both the lighting means and<br>
the imaging means pointed substantially at the volume of space in which<br>
the user desires to wield the wand.<br>
[0030] To help the user remain in this volume of space covered by the field<br>
of view of the imaging means, a pad 160 with a border marking 180 may be<br>
used to help the user estimate the field of view of the camera. A circle 170<br>
marked in the center of the pad helps the user to center the wand at the<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>
8<br>
start of the application or game. The surface material of the pad be also<br>
selected to minimize reflection of the sight used.<br>
[0031] All the information parameters relating to the wand's position<br>
(translation T = (tx, ty, tz)) and orientation such as pitch 201, roll 203 and yaw<br>
202 are expressed vvith respect to the frame of reference of the imaging<br>
device or camera (XXXX, YXXX ZXXX) (FIG. 2).<br>
[0032] The wand's frame (Xw, YXXX, ZXXX) is assumed to be aligned with the<br>
camera's frame (XXXX, YXXX, ZXXX) as an original condition. Any point on the wand<br>
w = (X, y, Z, 1) is transformed to another point XXX =  (xXXX yXXX, zXXX,1) in the<br>
camera's space by the following "XYZ fixed angle" transformation:<br>
W = T + RXXX RXXX RXXX W<br>
 where RXXX is the pitch rotation matrix about the XXXX axis;<br>
Ry is the yaw rotation matrix about the YXXX axis and<br>
RXXX is the roll rotation matrix about the ZXXX axis<br>
[0033] The relative positions of each bright spot to each other in each<br>
captured image is used by the accompanying algorithm of the present<br>
invention to reconstruct the position and orientation of the wand at each<br>
time interval. This information is then used to make corresponding<br>
movements in the object controlled by the user in the virtual environment<br>
[0034] Thus, the relative position of the tracking points of the wand in the<br>
 image as captured by the carriers are used in the present invention to<br>
reconstruct the movements of the wand.<br>
[0035] Another piece of information that is used is the distance between the<br>
cross piece's two tracking points d1 (the value of which is indicated by the<br>
line 323 in FiG. 3) and the distance between the two tracking points d2 of<br>
the wand nearest the cross piece ( the value of which is indicated by the<br>
line 322). The ratio of these two apparent distances captured by the camera<br>
is used in the reconstruction of the position of the object in the virtual<br>
environment represented by the wand.<br>
[0036] The tracking point 210 cm the wand nearest the handle end may not<br>
be captured by the irnaging device, depending on whether the wand is<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>
7<br>
oriented towards or away from the imaging device. However, the algoriithm<br>
of the present invention is capable to resolving captured images with either<br>
four or five tracking points.<br>
[0037] The four or five tracking points present in the captured image, are<br>
used by the algorithm of the present invention to determinate the<br>
longitudinal exis and the included angle XXX 324 as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
[0038] FIG. 3A shows an example of the image of the five tracking points in<br>
3D space captured by the camera in 2D representation. it is possible to join<br>
any two points to obtain 10 lines (FIG. 3B)<br>
[0039] The algorithm will begin by comparing a first 320 of these 10<br>
possible iines with another of these 10 possible lines to determine if the first<br>
line 320 bisects the other line 321 (FIG. 3C). This process is repeated XXX<br>
unsuccessful example is shown in FIG. 3D) until such two lines with this<br>
relationship are found (FIG. 3E). Thus, the line 322 that bisects another<br>
line is the longitudinal axis of the wand. The line 323 being bisected is the<br>
line defined by the tracking points of the cross piece, that is, the axis of the<br>
cross piece.<br>
[0040]   when the TWO axes have been identified bv the algorithm,  the<br>
intersection of the two axes defines the position of the reference origin 104-<br>
on the wand (FIG. 2), the junction of the wand and its cross piece. This is<br>
represented by the position 326 on the captured images.<br>
[0041] In addition, the included angle 0 of these two axes as well as the<br>
ratio of d1 and d2 as captured by the camera can also be determined. From<br>
line 323 and the x axis of the image, XXX 325, the angle formed by the<br>
projected axis of the cross piece with the horizontal axis of the image can<br>
also be determined. The degree of XXX can then be directly assigned by the<br>
angle δ.<br>
[0042] Concomitantly the translators tx and ty can be directly interpreted<br>
from the position of the wand's reference origin 326 in the captured image.<br>
[0043] The last bit information required is whether the best tracking point 210<br>
on the wand (nearest the handle end) can be seen in the captured image.<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>
8<br>
This information is represented by P5 which is 1 when the point is present<br>
and 0 when the point is absent.<br>
[0044] Once these essential parameter are known, the wand's position<br>
may then be reconstructed or obtained from the 8 DOF information stored<br>
in a prepared lookup table that performs the mapping:<br><br>
where XXX and XXX are the projected distances of either:<br>
a.       the two tracking points of the cross piece, If d1/d2 
b.       the distance of the fourth tracking 300 on the wand from the wand's<br>
origin 326, if d1/d2 
In the captured image when the wand's origin is at distances from the<br>
camera at the lower limit Z; and the upper limit XXX, respectivey, of the usable<br>
operating range from the camera, and where the wand's orientation is at the<br>
specific pitch and yaw given in the mapping above.<br>
[0045] The usable operating range thus defined is important as the lookup<br>
table has been generated based on this usable operational range from the<br>
camera. The usable operational range do not limit the present invention as<br>
the operating range can be varied and scaled to different applications with<br>
accompanying lookup tables. For most desktop applications, the two limits<br>
XXX and XXX are set at 25 cm and 50 cm respectively.<br>
[0046] The distance tXXX, the distance of the translated wind's ongin from the<br>
camera can then be approximated from the following formula:<br><br>
[0047] With the present invention, tracking user movements of the wand<br>
simply entails capturing the relative positions of the racking points,<br>
determining the essential parameters of the wand's position and orientation<br>
and then reconstructing the movement in the virtual environment<br>
concerned. This process is repeated at desired time intervals for as long as<br>
the present invention is in use.<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>

[0048] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that there will be<br>
positions in which the other objects such as the part of the user's body or<br>
the wand itself may mask one or more of the tracking points from the line of<br>
sight of the camera. When this happens, a simple algorithm may not be<br>
able to accommodate such situations. To over come this limitation, any<br>
driver software implementing this algorithm can be programmed to predict<br>
the intended trajectory or movement of the wand so as to ignore such<br>
situations and to resume processing when sufficient tracking points are<br>
detected again. With continue motion of the user's hand, such situations<br>
are not expected to occur with sufficient frequency to even cause any<br>
annoyance with users.<br>
[0049] The minimum number of tracking points for the preferred<br>
embodiment is four. In the case when the minimum number of tracking<br>
points oannot be captured by the imaging means after a predetermined<br>
number of time intervals, the driver software used would alert the user that<br>
an intolerable obscuration of the tracking points has occurred.<br>
[0050] Such situations may arise when the wand is out of the field of view of<br>
the camera or prolonged obscuration by some object The pad 160 of Fig.<br>
1 will help avoid such situations by reminding the user to keep the wand<br>
within the field of view of the imaging device.<br>
[0051] The distances between the tracking points have been carefully<br>
determined to minimize ambiguity when interpreting them on the images<br>
captured by the imaging device so that the position and orientation of the<br>
wand can be rapidly reconstructed.<br>
[0052] Another possible way to reconstruct the position of the wand from<br>
the relative positions of the tracking points in the captured image is by<br>
standard 3D reconstruction algorithms found in most textbooks on robotic<br>
vision and computer graphics techniques. However such algorithms are<br>
computationally expensive and discourage real-time operations in typical<br>
computers. As such, implementation of such algorithms is also not<br>
desirable at the time of this application as it goes against the aim of the<br>
present invention of implementation in simple computing devices. As such<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>
10<br>
a look up table is used in the interim to provide a reasonably fast response<br>
time.<br>
[0053] Despite this, the elements of the present invention will still work with<br>
algorithms that reconstruct 3D movements when processor capabilities are<br>
able to accommodate such algorithms.<br>
[0054] In the preferred embodiment, the lighting source is a ring light<br>
emmiting light substantially in 750-1000 nm, mounted in a co-axial<br>
arrangement around the lens of the camera.<br>
[0055] If light of a narrow wavelength range is used, suitable materials such<br>
as reflectors for the tracking points, filters for the lighting means, and lanses<br>
for the imaging device will also be required for optimal results. As the<br>
preferred embodiment uses light in the infrared range, the tracking points<br>
has coatings such as "Laser Gold' plating, optimized for maximal reftectance<br>
at this range of wavelengths.<br>
[0056] While a grayscale or color camera is usable under the present<br>
invention, cameras optimized to represent images using 1 bit per pixel (that<br>
is, in strict black and white representation) is preferred as data transmission<br>
requirements are minimized.<br>
[0057] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that many embodiments<br>
are possible under the scope of the present invention.  For example, the<br>
cross piece may be a V or L-shaped piece (FIG. 4A) equilateral triangle<br>
(FIG. 4B) or regular polygon. The present invention will work as long as the<br>
tracking points of the cross piece all lie on a plan perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the wand.<br>
[0058] Each tracking point ot the present invention may also emit or reflect<br>
different unique colors or wavelengths distinguishable by the imagine<br>
device. In such an embodiment, speed of reconstruction of the wand's<br>
position may be greatly increased as it will be easier and faster to<br>
distinguish the essential parameters of the wand's position, when used with<br>
a color imaging device.<br>
[0059] In this embodiment, the lighting source may illuminate with visible<br>
light and the reflective coating of the tracking points are selected to reflect<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>
11<br>
the color of choice. Alternatively, small radiation sources sush as light-<br>
emmiting diodes (LEDs) may be used in embodiments with active, light-<br>
emitting tracking points.<br>
[0060| The present invention is also scalable, depending on the application.<br>
The sensitivity of the present invention can be increased, say for tracking a<br>
surgeon's hand, by bringing the imaging device nearer the wand of by using<br>
imaging devices with higher resolution.<br>
[0061] Alternatively, more gross movements such as the swing of a<br>
modified racquet, bat or club may be captured by moving the camera<br>
further away. Capturing of images from these sports equipment may be<br>
done by placing tracking points on them or on representative simulated<br>
equipment.<br>
[0062] As technology advances, the refresh rate for capturing the images<br>
and the sensitivity of tracking the movements, may also be enhanced as<br>
processor speeds and capabilities increase.<br>
[0063] While the use of one imaging device has been described, it is<br>
possible to implement the present invention with more than one imaging<br>
device. If more than one imaging devices are used, triangulation<br>
techniques may be used to better reconstruct the distance of wand from the<br>
imaging devices.<br>
[0064] It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the algorithm<br>
described can be readify implemented in a variety of programming<br>
languages at various leveis from high level programming languages to<br>
assembly languages to machine languages. The integration of the present<br>
invention to various gaming and CAD/CAM applications may also be readily<br>
performed by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0065] The present invention therefore provides an input device comprising<br>
a wand with a cross piece, a lighting means, an imaging device, a<br>
processor end an algorithm and lookup table to allow users to overcome, or<br>
at least alleviate, the problems of the poor art.<br>
[0066] Although in the preferred embodiment, the processor used is that of<br>
the computer to which the imaging device is connected to, a separate.<br><br>
WO 2004/ 114112                                                                                             PC T/SG2004/000175<br>
12<br>
dedicated processor for interpreting the captured linages to obtain the<br>
position and orientation of the wand may also be used under the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0067] In addition, while the present invention has capability to determine<br>
the 3D, 6 DOF input data, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the<br>
present invention can also be readily modified to track either 3DOF input<br>
data alone or 8 DOF input date alons, as desired for other applications.<br>
[0068] It will be appreciated that although one preferred embodiment has<br>
been described in detail, various modifications and improvements can be<br>
made by a person skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
