				<td>APPARATUS FOR GLOBAL CORPORAL MOBILIZATION AND USE<br>
THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for the<br>
overall bodily mobilization of a human subject, that is<br>
to say an apparatus making it possible to set in motion<br>
the trunk, the limbs and the joints of the subject, and<br>
a use of such an apparatus.<br>
This type of apparatus is designed, preferably but not<br>
exclusively, to be used under the supervision of a<br>
physiotherapist who determines the mobilization<br>
movements generated by the apparatus.<br>
Recent neurophysiology studies reveal that the<br>
effectiveness of physiotherapy or osteotherapy care,<br>
applied for example to an injured subject, an aging<br>
person or a healthy subject, or else to a high-level<br>
sports person, is associated with the stimulation of<br>
the neurobiomechanical capabilities of the subject.<br>
Specifically, to stay upright and control the body,<br>
human beings receive information via various sensors,<br>
notably articular, vestibular, visual, cutaneous, etc.<br>
sensors. The brain processes this information by<br>
comparing it with internal models, that are innate and<br>
acquired, according to which human beings adjust their<br>
bodily responses. However, these internal models are<br>
sometimes insufficiently adaptive to respond to new<br>
situations, some of these models being able to have<br>
been lost or never having been acquired by training. It<br>
is understood that the richness of these models depends<br>
on the capability of the subject to adapt to the<br>
difficulties of the environment in which he moves<br>
and/or acts. In addition, in order for the instructions<br>
to control the movements of the body of the subject<br>
given by his brain to be effective, the articulations<br>
of the subject must be functionally reactive and the<br>
muscles which underpin these articulations must be<br>
strong and flexible. However, a portion of the motor<br>
competences of the subject may be lost, notably<br>
following an accident, as he ages, when he adopts<br>
inappropriate working postures or when he suffers from<br>
excess nervous tension.<br>
It is therefore understandable that the recovery or the<br>
training of the neurobiomechanical competences of the<br>
subject require stimulations and combined simulations<br>
as complete and varied as possible of his musculo-<br>
articular functions and of his neuro-vigilance<br>
capabilities.<br>
Items of apparatus that allow such a recovery or such a<br>
training are practically nonexistent today. The few<br>
items of apparatus available usually consist of a<br>
motorized platform which both rests and oscillates on a<br>
central bearing pivot, as in US-A-2,827,894 and US-<br>
4,313,603. The movements of these platforms provoke an<br>
imbalance of the body of the subject standing on the<br>
platform and induce thereby bodily reactions on his<br>
part. However, in practise, since all the mobilization<br>
movements generated by these items of apparatus are<br>
centered on their central bearing pivot, the body of<br>
the subject is not or is only slightly thrown off<br>
balance: during the movements of the apparatus, the<br>
basis of support of the subject's body, that is to say<br>
the virtual surface lying between the bearing points of<br>
the subject's feet standing upright on the platform and<br>
inside which the center of gravity of the subject's<br>
body should be projected so that the latter is not<br>
thrown totally off balance and falls, remains centered<br>
on the central bearing pivot. In other words, the<br>
sagittal axis of the subject's body remains generally<br>
in line with the central bearing pivot, which allows<br>
only a moderate bodily reaction, and always of the same<br>
type. In addition, the subject's weight and the forces<br>
that he generates so as not to fall are sustained in<br>
totality by the central bearing pivot, which makes it<br>
necessary, in order to limit the risks of breakage, to<br>
manufacture the latter in a particularly strong form,<br>
notably in the form of a cardan joint. The motive force<br>
necessary to operate the platform must then be designed<br>
appropriately, which results in a particularly heavy<br>
and bulky apparatus.<br>
US-A-5,813,958 also proposes an apparatus with an<br>
oscillating motorized platform which, in certain<br>
embodiments, incorporates a platform to support the<br>
subject, having a pre-set tilt so that the center of<br>
this platform is offcenter by a fixed distance relative<br>
to the vertical axis about which the platform rotates.<br>
In service, the imbalance of the subject is greater<br>
than with the items of apparatus mentioned above, but,<br>
because the tilt of the platform is fixed, linked to<br>
the very structure of the apparatus, the mobilization<br>
movements generated have kinematics that are fixed and<br>
therefore not very effective and not very powerful to<br>
the extent that the subject rapidly takes account of<br>
the fixed offcentering of the platform in order to<br>
quickly regain his balance and neutralize the<br>
neurobiomechanical stimulation supplied by the<br>
apparatus by anticipating the characteristics of this<br>
stimulation. In addition, the structure of the<br>
apparatus is particularly heavy and bulky because of<br>
the interposition between the frame of the apparatus<br>
and its platform of a rotary disk on which the platform<br>
rests in order to be tilted in a preset manner.<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose an<br>
apparatus for overall bodily mobilization which, while<br>
being reliable, light and having a small space<br>
requirement, makes it possible both to throw the<br>
subject off balance and significantly move the basis of<br>
support and the instantaneous pressure centers of the<br>
subject's body in an effective and controlled manner,<br>
in order to act on the body in movements generated so<br>
as to strengthen or maintain the subject's<br>
neurobiomechanical competences.<br>
Accordingly, the subject of the invention is an<br>
apparatus for overall bodily mobilization of a human<br>
subject, as defined in claim 1.<br>
Thanks to the apparatus according to the invention, the<br>
center of the basis of support and the instantaneous<br>
pressure centers of a subject's body may be moved aside<br>
transversely from the fixed axis defined by the<br>
apparatus: when the subject stands, notably upright, on<br>
the platform, his basis of support is generally<br>
centered on the central zone of the platform, while the<br>
latter is designed to be able to be thrown offcenter<br>
relative to the fixed axis. This throwing offcenter of<br>
the platform is accompanied by a tilting of the latter,<br>
controlled by the peripheral bearing means with which<br>
the platform is furnished, which causes the imbalance<br>
of the subject and the activation of his<br>
neurobiomechanical capabilities as explained above. In<br>
service, when the platform is operated in an offcenter<br>
manner about the fixed axis, the subject's body is<br>
mobilized by a centrifugal force in a circumferential<br>
direction coupled with a linear mobilization parallel<br>
to the plane of the platform, linked to the tilting of<br>
the latter. In other words, the apparatus according to<br>
the invention produces controlled movements of its<br>
platform which throw the subject off balance, causing a<br>
circumferential and laterally translational movement of<br>
the basis of support and of the instantaneous pressure<br>
centers of the subject's body.<br>
The centrifugal effect of this movement is applied in<br>
particular to all the bodily elements that comprise the<br>
cylindrical beam formed by the trunk/abdomen assembly.<br>
The reaction to this centrifugal force is a powerful<br>
effort of centripetal restoration by all the muscles of<br>
the body.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention therefore<br>
produces a neurobiomechanical action suited to the<br>
articular, muscular and informational complexity of the<br>
subject's body in order to return to him, as much as<br>
possible, all his dynamic potential or in order to push<br>
him to his neuromotive limits of adjustment. In<br>
practise, the apparatus generates various types of<br>
actions, such as vestibular, articular, cutaneous,<br>
postural, muscular, neurological, genitopelvic, etc.<br>
actions. Specifically, depending on the adjustments of<br>
the motorized means and depending on the posture of the<br>
subject on the platform, various zones of the body, and<br>
even the whole body, are mobilized in a coordinated<br>
manner. When the subject stands for example upright on<br>
the platform, it is possible to mobilize his legs only,<br>
his legs and his trunk, or his legs, his trunk and his<br>
arms. Depending on the muscular recruitment commanded,<br>
the bodily mobilization is accompanied by significant<br>
burning of calories. In a more general manner, on the<br>
apparatus, the subject's body must not be considered to<br>
be a rigid and stable object: on the contrary, this<br>
body is deformable and comprises a large number of<br>
articulations that are as many degrees of liberty to be<br>
mastered in order to maintain postural control and to<br>
obtain a variable and complex spatial orientation. The<br>
posturo-kinetic activities performed by the subject on<br>
the apparatus will ensure the coordination of the<br>
various articulated elements of his body: in response<br>
to the movements of the platform, the subject puts in<br>
place a postural strategy, that is to say an action<br>
plan that is coordinated between the various portions<br>
of his body involved in the activity, for the purpose<br>
of maintaining or recovering an efficient postural<br>
attitude.<br>
In addition, in service, the weight of the subject and<br>
the mobilization efforts that he generates are<br>
sustained by the peripheral bearing means, in other<br>
words on the periphery of the platform, in a relatively<br>
extensive zone where, for example, several bearing<br>
points may advantageously be provided, while the<br>
corresponding supporting means are supported fixedly by<br>
the frame, without having to interpose an additional<br>
movable component between the platform and the frame.<br>
The reliability and robustness of the apparatus are<br>
therefore remarkable. In addition, since the periphery<br>
of the platform supports the highest forces, the<br>
operating means are advantageously provided to produce<br>
and transmit essentially, or even exclusively, the<br>
motive forces of movement of the platform. The motive<br>
force necessary has not had to be overengineered which<br>
results in a small space requirement of the platform<br>
operating means.<br>
Other features of this apparatus, taken in isolation or<br>
in all the technically possible combinations, are set<br>
out in claims 2 to 15.<br>
A further subject of the invention is the use of a<br>
mobilization apparatus as defined above, characterized<br>
in that both the amplitude of throwing offcenter of the<br>
platform relative to the fixed axis and the speed of<br>
rotary operation of the platform about this fixed axis<br>
are adjusted in a combined or separate manner.<br>
This use is based on the presence of control means,<br>
belonging to the apparatus, suitable for adjusting the<br>
apparatus in an appropriate manner.<br>
The invention will be better understood on reading the<br>
following description given only as an example and made<br>

figure 16 and figure 18, similar to figure 17,<br>
illustrates the apparatus in a different operating<br>
configuration than that of figure 17.<br>
Figures 1 to 7 represent an apparatus 1 for the bodily<br>
mobilization of a subject 2, designed to set in motion<br>
the limbs and articulations of the subject. The<br>
apparatus 1 is designed to be used under the<br>
supervision of a physiotherapist or a similar health<br>
professional, so that the latter determines the<br>
mobilization movements imposed on the subject by the<br>
apparatus. In practise, the apparatus 1 is used in a<br>
physiotherapist's or osteotherapist's medical office,<br>
or more generally in a care center, for example in a<br>
retirement home, or a thalassotherapy institute. As a<br>
variant, the subject may use the apparatus 1 in an<br>
autonomous manner, notably for the purpose of physical<br>
exercises, the apparatus then being made available in a<br>
gym or similar room.<br>
The apparatus 1 comprises a frame 10 for resting on the<br>
ground S. For convenience, the rest of the description<br>
is oriented relative to the ground, so that the term<br>
"vertical" indicates a direction that is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the ground S, while the term<br>
"horizontal" indicates a direction substantially<br>
perpendicular to the vertical thus defined. Similarly,<br>
the terms "bottom" and "lower" indicate a direction<br>
directed toward the ground, while the terms "top" and<br>
"upper" indicate a direction in the opposite direction.<br>
The frame 10 comprises an essentially tubular structure<br>
which, seen from above as in figure 2, has a generally<br>
hexagonal shape, with six individual rectilinear<br>
uprights 12, which extend in one and the same plane.<br>
These uprights rest on the ground by means of feet 14,<br>
distributed around the periphery of the frame. At their<br>
free end, each of these feet 14 is advantageously<br>
furnished with an adjustment screw 15 (figure 1),<br>
making it possible to adapt the frame 10 to any<br>
unevennesses of the ground S, so that the uprights 12<br>
extend horizontally as much as possible. Two of the<br>
uprights 12, opposite to one another, are rigidly<br>
connected to a horizontal crossmember 16 along which a<br>
power unit 18 is arranged. This unit 18 comprises, on<br>
the one hand, an electric motor 20 whose outer case 22<br>
is fixedly attached to the crossmember 16 and, on the<br>
other hand, a reducing-gear stage 24, mounted at the<br>
output of the motor 20 and whose output shaft 26<br>
extends vertically, in the central zone of the<br>
hexagonal shape of the uprights 12. Under the control<br>
of the unit 18, the shaft 26 is designed to rotate on<br>
itself about its axis Z-Z, as indicated by the arrow R.<br>
The apparatus 1 comprises means, not shown, of<br>
electrical power supply and of variable control of the<br>
motor 20.<br>
At its upper free end, the shaft 26 is secured to a<br>
rectilinear horizontal bar 30. The upper end of the<br>
shaft 26 is for example sleeve-fitted or screwed into a<br>
matching orifice of the bar 30, so that the shaft and<br>
the bar are kinematically connected to one another. In<br>
other words, when the shaft 26 rotates about its axis<br>
Z-Z, the bar 30 also rotates about this axis, in a<br>
rotary movement R.<br>
The bar 30 extends on either side of the shaft 26. At<br>
one of its longitudinal ends, the bar 30 supports an<br>
electric motor 32 whose outer case 34 is attached to<br>
the bar 30 and whose output shaft 36 acts on a carriage<br>
38 mounted so as to slide along the bar 30. The motor<br>
32 is supplied from the motor 20, by means of a slip-<br>
ring 28 arranged about the shaft 26 and making it<br>
possible to make electric connections between fixed<br>
contacts of the power unit 18 and rotary contacts<br>
associated with the motor 32. Electric current may<br>
therefore travel, via this slip-ring, from the motor 20<br>
to the motor 32, including when the bar 30 rotates<br>
about the axis Z-Z.<br>
The apparatus 1 also comprises means, not shown, for<br>
the variable control of the motor 32.<br>
The carriage 38, under the control of the output shaft<br>
36 of the motor 32, can be moved in a horizontal<br>
translational movement T, along the bar 30 which<br>
thereby forms a slide, between two extreme positions<br>
respectively represented in figures 3 and 4. End-of-<br>
travel detectors are advantageously provided along the<br>
bar 30 and connected to the means of control of the<br>
motor 32.<br>
The carriage 38 supports a vertical rectilinear rod 40<br>
whose bottom portion is secured fixedly to the<br>
carriage. The axis Z'-Z' of this rod 40 therefore<br>
extends parallel to the axis Z-Z of the shaft 26, while<br>
being able to be moved relative to this axis Z-Z in the<br>
horizontal translational movement T. In its extreme<br>
position of figure 3, the carriage 38 positions the<br>
axis Z'-Z' at a distance from the axis Z-Z, with a<br>
horizontal off center distance marked e in figure 3. In<br>
its extreme position of figure 4, the carriage 38 is<br>
placed in line with the shaft 26, so that the axes Z-Z<br>
and Z'-Z' extend vertically in the extension of one<br>
another. Between these two extreme positions, the<br>
offcentering of the axis Z'-Z' relative to the axis Z-Z<br>
is variable, depending on the position of the carriage<br>
38 along the slide bar 30, under the control of the<br>
motor 32, between a maximum value corresponding to the<br>
aforementioned distance e for the carriage position of<br>
figure 3 and a zero value for the carriage position of<br>
figure 4.<br>
In service, when the shaft 26 rotates on itself about<br>
its axis Z-Z, the rod 40 is therefore rotated about<br>
this axis Z-Z, while being either thrown offcenter<br>
relative to this axis when the offcentering of the axis<br>
Z'-Z' is not zero, or in the vertical extension of the<br>
shaft 26 when this offcentering is zero. In the latter<br>
case, the rod 40 then rotates on itself, about its axis<br>
Z'-Z' indistinguishable from the axis Z-Z.<br>
The mobilization apparatus 1 also comprises a platform<br>
44, being generally disk-shaped, defining a central<br>
axis of revolution 44A, and a substantially flat upper<br>
face 44B and lower face 44C.<br>
In its central portion, the platform 44 delimits an<br>
orifice 46 that is centered on the axis 44A and whose<br>
emergence on the lower face 44C is surrounded by an<br>
annular flange 48 made of the same material as the rest<br>
of the platform 44.<br>
The platform 44 is suitable for being assembled to the<br>
carriage 38, by inserting the rod 40 from the bottom<br>
into the orifice 46, with interposition of a swivel<br>
joint 50 represented in greater detail in figure 5.<br>
This swivel joint 50 comprises, on the one hand, an<br>
outer socket 52, immobilized in the flange 48 by a<br>
bolted cover 49, and, on the other hand, an inner ball<br>
54 delimiting an inner bore with a cross section that<br>
matches that of the rod 40. In a manner known per se,<br>
the outer socket and the inner ball articulate in one<br>
another, by interaction of respective hemispherical<br>
surfaces allowing the inner ball to pivot freely in all<br>
directions relative to the outer socket, with<br>
predetermined maximum clearances. In this way, when the<br>
platform 44 is fitted around the rod 40, this platform<br>
may pivot freely about the inner ball 54 of the swivel<br>
joint 50.<br>
In its outer periphery, the platform 44 is furnished,<br>
in a fixed manner, with five feet 60 extending downward<br>
in protrusion from its lower face 44C as shown<br>
schematically in figure 6. The feet 60 are designed to<br>
rest on the frame 10 when the platform is fitted around<br>
the rod 40, so that the weight of the platform is, at<br>
least mostly, and even exclusively, supported by the<br>
frame via the feet 60, while the lower face of the<br>
swivel joint 50 is pressed against none of the elements<br>
situated beneath the central zone of the platform,<br>
notably the carriage 38.<br>
Each foot 60 extends generally in a direction parallel<br>
to the axis 44A and comprises, at its lower end, a<br>
sliding shoe 62 fixedly attached to the foot, for<br>
example by sleeve-fitting and/or by screwing. Each shoe<br>
62 is suitable for resting against a discal element 64<br>
fixedly attached to the frame 10. As shown in figure 2,<br>
five discal elements 64 are provided, respectively at<br>
five of the six uprights 12 of the frame, while being<br>
distributed in a substantially uniform manner along the<br>
periphery of these uprights.<br>
Each discal element 64 has a convex upper surface 64A<br>
against which the shoe 62 rests in a sliding manner, a<br>
lubricant advantageously being able to be applied to<br>
the surface 64A. This surface 64A corresponds to a<br>
portion of an imaginary sphere 66 represented<br>
schematically in figure 6. This sphere 66, common to<br>
all the surfaces 64A of the discal elements 64, defines<br>
a center C through which the axis Z-Z passes, while<br>
each portion of surface 64A extends about a central<br>
axis corresponding to a diameter of the sphere 66 and<br>
has an outer circular contour centered on this axis, as<br>
shown in figure 7.<br>
When the platform 44 is fitted around the rod 40, the<br>
shoes 62 rest in mobile contact against the surfaces<br>
64A of the discal elements 64, as shown in figures 3<br>
and 4 and as indicated schematically in an exploded<br>
manner in figure 6. When each of the shoes 62 is<br>
positioned substantially in the center 64B of the<br>
corresponding surface 64A, as shown in figure 4, and as<br>
indicated schematically in dashed lines in figure 7,<br>
the platform 44 extends horizontally, being centered on<br>
the axis Z-Z, as shown schematically in figure 6. The<br>
assembly of the platform 44 around the rod 40 can<br>
therefore be envisaged only if this rod extendss<br>
coaxially to the axis Z-Z with the carriage 38 in its<br>
position of figure 4.<br>
By sliding against the surfaces 64A, the shoes 62 can<br>
be freely moved in a centered manner on the center C of<br>
the imaginary sphere 66. The clearances of each shoe<br>
are limited by the transverse extent of the surface<br>
64A, surrounded by a protruding border 64C.<br>
It is understood that the platform 44 can be moved in<br>
one piece relative to the discal elements 64, so that,<br>
when one of the shoes 62 occupies an extreme bottom<br>
position with respect to its associated surface 64A, as<br>
shown in figure 3 and as indicated schematically as a<br>
solid line in figure 7, the other shoes 62 occupy,<br>
against their associated surface 64A, intermediate<br>
positions between this extreme bottom position and an<br>
extreme top position diametrically opposed to the<br>
extreme bottom position relative to the center 64B of<br>
the surface 64A. The platform 44 is then tilted<br>
relative to a horizontal plane, that is to say that its<br>
axis 44A forms a nonzero angle with the vertical<br>
while its central orifice 46 is radially thrown<br>
off center relative to the axis Z-Z. When the platform<br>
4 4 is assembled around the rod 40, such a tilt of the<br>
platform is therefore allowed only when the rod 40 is<br>
thrown offcenter relative to the axis Z-Z, as in figure<br>
3. In practise, the radial distance between the center<br>
64B of the surface 64A and the shoe 62 in the extreme<br>
bottom position corresponds substantially to the<br>
aforementioned value e.<br>
Therefore, when the platform 44 is assembled around the<br>
rod 40, it is understood that the operation of the<br>
carriage 38 in the direction of horizontal translation<br>
T causes the platform 44 to travel between its<br>
horizontal configuration of figure 4 and its tilted<br>
configuration of figure 3, by sliding pressure of the<br>
shoes 62 against the surfaces 64A of the elements 64,<br>
the tilt of the platform relative to the rod 40 being<br>
allowed by the swivel joint 50.<br>
An example of use of the apparatus 1 will be described<br>
below.<br>
Initially, it is considered that the platform 44<br>
occupies its horizontal configuration of figure 4. The<br>
subject 2 therefore easily mounts the platform 44 with<br>
his feet resting on the upper surface 44B of this<br>
platform, as shown in figure 1. In this configuration,<br>
if the motor 20 is actuated, the shaft 26 rotates on<br>
itself about its axis Z-Z and, by means of the bar 30,<br>
this rotary movement is communicated to the rod 40,<br>
which also rotates on itself. The ball 54 then rotates<br>
freely inside the socket 52 and the platform 44 remains<br>
immobile relative to the frame 10.<br>
Now considering that the motor 20 is stopped and that<br>
the motor 32 is actuated, the carriage 38 is moved<br>
horizontally according to the movement T. The platform<br>
44 is then operated in a corresponding translational<br>
movement. Since this platform rests via these shoes 62<br>
on the surfaces 64A of the discal elements 64, this<br>
translational movement causes the platform to tilt so<br>
that the latter forms a non-zero angle a with the<br>
horizontal in the plane of figure 3, that is to say in<br>
the vertical plane P passing through both the axes Z-Z<br>
and Z'-Z'. At the maximum, this tilt may be adjusted<br>
until one of the shoes 62 butts against the peripheral<br>
border 64C of its associated discal element 64, as in<br>
figure 3. In this tilted configuration, the subsequent<br>
actuation of the motor 20, while the motor 32 is<br>
stopped, causes the axis Z'-Z' to rotate offcenter<br>
about the axis Z-Z, so that the plane P containing the<br>
axes Z-Z and Z'-Z' rotates about the axis Z-Z in the<br>
rotary movement R. This means that the axis 44A of the<br>
platform 44 also rotates about the axis Z-Z, according<br>
to the rotation R, so that, at the end of one<br>
revolution in itself of the shaft 26, this axis 44A<br>
generates a substantially conical casing surface, with<br>
an axis Z-Z and a half-angle at the vertex ß which<br>
corresponds to the tilt a of the platform 44 in the<br>
plane P. Seen from above, in the vertical direction,<br>
the center 44D of the platform, defined by the<br>
intersection between the axis 44A and the face 44B,<br>
describes a circular trajectory T441 centered on the<br>
axis Z-Z and having a radius of substantially e, as<br>
shown in figure 8. At the same time, the shoes 62 slide<br>
against the surface 64A of their corresponding discal<br>
element 64 in a substantially circular trajectory<br>
centered on the center 64B of this surface, as shown at<br>
68 in figure 7.<br>
When the tilt is not adjusted to its maximum, which<br>
amounts to saying that the carriage 38 is offcenter<br>
with a nonzero value of less than e, the center 44D of<br>
the platform 44 describes a circular trajectory<br>
centered on the axis Z-Z and with a radius of less than<br>
e. Two examples of such intermediate trajectories,<br>
referenced T442 and T443 are represented in figure 8.<br>
If, during the rotation R controlled by the motor 20,<br>
the offcenter distance between the axes Z-Z and Z'-Z'<br>
is modified, by moving the carriage 38 along the<br>
sliding bar 30, the movement of the platform 44 departs<br>
from the basic kinematics described above in order to<br>
adopt a more elaborate kinematic, which however is<br>
instantaneously similar to the basic kinematic. For<br>
example, if the rotary movement R is maintained with a<br>
constant intensity and if it is combined with the<br>
translational movement T, the center 44D of the<br>
platform describes, seen from above, a trajectory T444<br>
in the shape of a spiral centered on the axis Z-Z, as<br>
shown in figure 9.<br>
It can therefore be understood that, when the offcenter<br>
distance between the axes Z-Z and Z'-Z' is not zero, as<br>
in figure 3, the rotary motive movement R operates the<br>
platform 44 so that it describes an offcenter rotary<br>
travel about the axis Z-Z, while being tilted relative<br>
to a horizontal plane, the tilt a of the platform being<br>
the most marked in the plane P containing the axes Z-Z<br>
and Z'-Z'. The subject standing on the platform 44 is<br>
then thrown off balance and is subjected to a<br>
centrifugal force: the bodily axis of the subject<br>
corresponds generally to the axis 44A, so that the<br>
vertical projection of the center of gravity of the<br>
subject is instantaneously thrown offcenter relative to<br>
the axis Z-Z, while being at a distance from the center<br>
of the basis of support of the subject's body, while<br>
this basis of support is made to move by the platform.<br>
Depending on the adjustment of the tilt a of the<br>
platform, the imbalance cf the subject is more or less<br>
accentuated, forcing the latrer to mobilize his body in<br>
a corresponding manner in order not to fall. In<br>
practise, the apparatus 1 is associated with a fixed<br>
handrail 70, for example secured to the frame 10, which<br>
the subject can grasp to prevent a total loss of<br>
balance. This handrail 70 is schematically represented<br>
in figure 1 only, it being understood that various<br>
forms of means allowing the subject to stand on the<br>
platform in movement can be envisaged.<br>
The apparatus 1 is controlled by a physiotherapist or,<br>
more generally, a health professional, who adjusts the<br>
operating speed of the motor 20, the tilt a of the<br>
platform 44 by adjusting the position of the carriage<br>
38 along the sliding bar 30 by controlling the motor 32<br>
and the possible actuation of the motor 32 while the<br>
motor 20 runs, which amounts to combining the rotary<br>
movement R and the horizontal translational movement T.<br>
If the apparatus 1 is intended to be used in an<br>
autonomous manner by the subject, the control means are<br>
advantageously incorporated into the handrail 70, so<br>
that the subject can modify the operating kinematics of<br>
the platform 44 during his exercise. On this subject,<br>
for the use of the apparatus 1 in a gym, it will be<br>
noted that, in operation, all the muscles of the<br>
subject's body are rapidly and intensely worked, which<br>
combines a significant burning-off of fat and exercises<br>
of articular flexing and of coordinated musculation.<br>
In all cases, control programs for the motors 20 and 32<br>
may be predetermined, being stored notably in a memory<br>
that can be accessed by the aforementioned control<br>
means.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 relate to a variant embodiment of the<br>
apparatus 1. This variant differs from the apparatus<br>
considered in figures 1 to 9 only by its bearing<br>
elements of the platform 44, which replace the elements<br>
64 envisaged hitherto. More precisely, the elements 64<br>
are replaced by five elements 841 to 845, distributed<br>
along the periphery of the frame 10 in the same manner<br>
as the elements 64. The element 843 is identical to the<br>
corresponding element 64, while the other elements 841,<br>
842, 844 and 845 each correspond to an element 64, but<br>
with a larger transverse size: the two elements 842 and<br>
844 closest to the element 843 therefore have a radial<br>
dimension, relative to their central axis,<br>
approximately one and a half times greater than the<br>
corresponding dimension of the elements 64, while the<br>
two elements 841 and 845 furthest from the element 843<br>
have a radial dimension approximately twice as large as<br>
the corresponding dimension of the elements 64.<br>
Apart from this radial dimension, the structural<br>
features of the elements 841 to 845 are similar to those<br>
of the elements 64: each of the elements 841 to 845 has<br>
a convex upper surface 84A1 to 84A5 which corresponds to<br>
a portion of the imaginary sphere 66 of figure 6 and<br>
which is surrounded by a protruding peripheral border<br>
84C1 to 84C5.<br>
The variant embodiment of figures 10 and 11 furthermore<br>
comprises an additional component, namely a guide plate<br>
90 fixedly attached, by securing means not shown, to<br>
any one of the elements 841 to 845, to the element 843<br>
in the example shown, while covering its surface 84A3 in<br>
the manner of a cap. This plate therefore has a<br>
generally discal shape, designed to be received in a<br>
matching manner inside the border 84C3 with its lower<br>
surface 90A matching the surface 84A3, as shown in<br>
figure 11. The plate 90 delimits, along one of its<br>
diameters, a groove 92 passing through the plate from<br>
side to side along its thickness and therefore emerging<br>
on the surface 84A3 when the plate is assembled to the<br>
element 843. In the assembled state of figure 10, the<br>
longitudinal direction of this groove belongs to the<br>
vertical plane P843 containing the axis Z-Z and the<br>
center 84B3 of the element 843, it being noted that this<br>
plane corresponds to the plane of figure 11. The groove<br>
92 is suitable for receiving the shoe 62 of the foot 60<br>
associated with the element 843, the width of the groove<br>
being substantially equal to the corresponding<br>
dimension of the shoe. The vibrations or small ranges<br>
of movement of the platform 44 relative to the frame 10<br>
are thereby limited, conferring on the platform a<br>
greater stability for the subject standing on this<br>
platform. In addition, when the shoe 62 is received in<br>
the groove 92, this shoe can be moved, relative to the<br>
element 843, only along the groove 92, in other words<br>
along the rectilinear trajectory 94 contained in the<br>
plane P843 of figure 11. In these conditions, the groove<br>
92 prevents the corresponding shoe 62 from describing a<br>
circular trajectory against the surface 84A3, similar to<br>
the trajectory 68 of figure 7, which disrupts the<br>
movement of the whole platform 44.<br>
In operation, when the platform 44 is rotated offcenter<br>
about the axis Z-Z, it moves away from the position<br>
that it would occupy in the absence of the plate 90,<br>
while accommodating its inability to travel from side<br>
to side of the plane P843 at the element 843, by greater<br>
movements at the other elements, in particular at the<br>
elements 841 and 845 furthest from the element 843. When<br>
the offcenter movement of the platform is maximal<br>
(value e), the center 44D of the platform describes the<br>
trajectory T445 represented in figure 12, that is to say<br>
a trajectory centered about the axis Z-Z and having an<br>
ampler curved shape on the side of the elements 841 and<br>
845. At the peripheral portions of the platform in line<br>
with the elements 841 and 845, the amplitude of the<br>
movements of the platform is of the order of twice that<br>
at the peripheral portion of the platform in line with<br>
the element 843, which explains the design of the<br>
elements 841 to 845. Figure 12 also represents<br>
intermediate trajectories T446 and T447, similar to the<br>
trajectories T442 and T443 shown in figure 8, that is to<br>
say for offcenter values smaller than the value e.<br>
Similarly, figure 13 shows a trajectory T448 obtained in<br>
the same operating conditions as for the trajectory T444<br>
of figure 9, that is to say by combining the offcenter<br>
rotary movement R and the horizontal translational<br>
movement T.<br>
Thanks to this variant embodiment, the apparatus 1<br>
supplies bodily mobilization kinematics that are more<br>
intricate than those supplied by the apparatus of<br>
figures 1 to 9, inducing differentiated biomechanical<br>
reactions for the subject depending on whether the<br>
latter is standing, amongst other things, in the<br>
central zone of the platform, in the peripheral zone<br>
overhanging the element 843 or in the opposite<br>
peripheral zone overhanging the elements 841 and 845.<br>
Advantageously, the angular position of the plate 90<br>
can be adjusted relative to the discal element 843 so<br>
that the position of the groove 92 may be modified so<br>
as to have the direction of the trajectory 94 vary<br>
relative to the plane P843. In the configuration of the<br>
groove 92 represented in dashed lines in figure 10, the<br>
trajectory 94 forms an angle of approximately 45° with<br>
the plane P843, seen from above in the vertical<br>
direction. Depending on the operating adjustments of<br>
the apparatus 1, the center 44D of the platform 44<br>
describes trajectories T449 to T4412 represented in<br>
figures 14 and 15 corresponding respectively to the<br>
trajectories T445 to T448 of figures 12 and 13.<br>
By changing the direction of the trajectory 94 relative<br>
to the axis Z-Z, the user induces a dissymmetry of the<br>
ranges of movements of the platform 44 relative to the<br>
plane P843 which makes it possible to exercise in a<br>
manner differentiated in intensity the opposite sides<br>
of the subject standing on the platform.<br>
Optionally, the apparatus incorporates means not shown<br>
making it possible to have the direction of the<br>
trajectory 94 vary relative to the fixed axis Z-Z<br>
during the operation of the apparatus 1, by rotation of<br>
the plate 90 against the surface 84A3.<br>
Figures 16 to 18 represent schematically another<br>
embodiment of an overall bodily mobilization apparatus<br>
100. As for the apparatus 1 of the preceding figures,<br>
the apparatus 100 essentially comprises a fixed frame<br>
110, a movable platform 112 and means for operating the<br>
platform relative to the frame, these operating means<br>
being in the form of two motorized cylinders 114 and<br>
116, both connected to one and the same control and<br>
adjustment unit 118.<br>
The platform 112 defines a central axis of revolution<br>
112A and delimits, on the one hand, an upper face 112B<br>
on which the subject is intended to stand and, on the<br>
other hand, a lower face 112C directed toward the frame<br>
110. The platform 112 is surrounded, on its outer<br>
periphery, by an edge 120 extending downward from the<br>
face 112C and furnished, at its lower end, with an<br>
inner ring 122 suitable for resting on the frame 110.<br>
Accordingly, the frame 110 includes, in its upper<br>
portion, a hemispherical wall 124 extending all around<br>
a rigid central post 126 whose longitudinal axis W-W is<br>
substantially vertical. The lower surface 122A of the<br>
ring 122 substantially matches the upper surface 124A<br>
of the wall of the frame 124 so that the platform 112<br>
has capabilities of movement relative to the frame 110<br>
similar to those of the platform 44 relative to the<br>
frame 10 for the apparatus 1 of figures 1 to 7, the<br>
hemispherical surface 124A matching a dome of the<br>
imaginary sphere 66 considered in figure 6.<br>
Each cylinder 114, 116 comprises a rod 130, 132 that<br>
can be moved in translation in its longitudinal<br>
direction relative to the body 134, 136 of the<br>
cylinder. The free end of each rod 130, 132 rests<br>
against the central post 126 of the frame 110 so that<br>
the deployment or retraction of the rod relative to its<br>
body 134, 136 cause this body to move further away or<br>
respectively closer to the post 126. The end of each<br>
body 134, 136 opposite to the corresponding rod 130,<br>
132 is mechanically connected to the edge 120 of the<br>
platform 112 with interposition of a swivel joint<br>
138, 140.<br>
Seen from above, as in figure 16, the cylinders 114 and<br>
116 extend lengthwise in a manner transverse to the<br>
axis W-W defined by the central post 126, forming<br>
between them an angle of approximately 90°.<br>
The unit 118 is suitable for controlling the deployment<br>
and the retraction of each rod 130, 132 relative to the<br>
corresponding body 134, 136 of the cylinders, which<br>
causes the platform 112 to move relative to the frame<br>
110, the movement of the cylinder body being<br>
transmitted to the platform by means of the swivel<br>
joint 138, 140.<br>
At rest, as shown in figures 16 and 17, the total<br>
lengths of the cylinders 114 and 116 are designed so<br>
that the platform 112 extends in a substantially<br>
horizontal manner, its axis 112A then being<br>
substantially indistinguishable from the axis W-W. In<br>
service, when the unit 118 controls, for example, the<br>
deployment of the rod 130, the cylinder body 134 is<br>
translated radially and outward relative to the axis W-<br>
W as indicated by the arrow T in figure 18. The<br>
platform 112 is then operated in a corresponding<br>
translational movement, combined with a tilting<br>
relative to the horizontal in the plane of figure 17,<br>
by the sliding of the surface 122A against the surface<br>
124A. The axes W-W and 112A then form a nonzero angle<br>
ß. It is understood that a similar control of the<br>
cylinder 116 by the unit 118 causes an offcentering and<br>
a tilting similar to the platform 112 relative to the<br>
frame 110, so that, by means of an appropriate control<br>
loop, notably by electronic means, the coordinated<br>
control of the two cylinders 114 and 116 makes it<br>
possible to operate the platform 112 in a kinematic<br>
similar to that described above for the platform 44<br>
relative to the frame 10, that is to say which makes it<br>
possible at the same time, by the translation T, to<br>
throw the platform offcenter relative to the axis W-W<br>
and to rotate it, as indicated by the arrow R, about<br>
this axis when it is offcenter, with the platform then<br>
tilted relative to the horizontal in the vertical plane<br>
passing through the axes W-W and 112A.<br>
Naturally, the embodiment of figures 16 to 18 may<br>
incorporate the teaching of the variant of figures 10<br>
to 15, in the sense that the ring 122 may, at a point<br>
on its periphery, be guided relative to the frame wall<br>
124 in a rectilinear trajectory like the trajectory 94.<br>
To do this, a rectilinear guide rail is, for example,<br>
fitted to the upper surface 124A of the wall 124, while<br>
a foot, similar to one of the feet 60 and attached to<br>
the lower surface 122A of the ring 122, is received in<br>
a sliding manner in this rail. As an option, the<br>
position of the rail relative to the wall 124 may be<br>
changed to adjust the orientation of the trajectory 94<br>
relative to a fixed vertical plane, which makes it<br>
possible to describe at the center of the platform 112<br>
trajectories like the trajectories T445 to T4412 of<br>
figures 12 to 15.<br>
Various optional arrangements and variants to the items<br>
of mobilization apparatus 1 and 100 described above can<br>
furthermore be envisaged. As examples:<br>
- to damp the abutting of the shoes 62 against the<br>
border 64C of their corresponding discal element 64<br>
when the platform 44 is tilted with its maximal<br>
amplitude, each shoe 62 may be furnished with a<br>
flexible peripheral padding, for example in the form<br>
of a ring fitted around the main body of the shoe;<br>
- other embodiments of the end of the feet 60 pressing<br>
movably on the discal elements 64 are possible, the<br>
shoes 62 being able for example to be replaced by<br>
balls or other rolling elements; in particular, the<br>
shoes 62 may be replaced by rollers, notably<br>
connected in a freewheeling manner to the lower face<br>
of the platform; such rollers have the advantage of<br>
adapting instantaneously to the movements of the<br>
platform without inertial or braking effect;<br>
- in the absence of the plate 90, to prevent vibrations<br>
or small movements of the platform 44 relative to the<br>
discal elements, linked notably to the clearances<br>
inherent in the apparatus, dampers, of the pneumatic<br>
cylinder type for example, may be provided directly<br>
interposed between each foot 60 and the frame 10;<br>
- if the user foregoes the ability to vary the degree<br>
of offcentering between the axes Z-Z and Z'-Z' during<br>
the rotary movement R generated by the power unit 18,<br>
the motor 32 may be replaced by any mechanical means<br>
making it possible to adjust the position of the<br>
carriage 38 along the bar 30, such a means notably<br>
being controlled manually, preferably before the<br>
subject gets onto the platform 44;<br>
- the platforms 44 and 112 may have other shapes than<br>
the generally discal shape envisaged above; these<br>
platforms may therefore have, when seen from above,<br>
an ovoid, rectangular, etc. shape;<br>
- rather than providing for the carriage 38 to be<br>
placed in abutment along the sliding bar 30 when it<br>
is in line with the shaft 26, the sliding bar may be<br>
designed lengthwise so that the carriage may be moved<br>
translationally either side of the axis Z-Z;<br>
- the number of foot 60/discal element 64 pairs may be<br>
provided to be higher or lower than five; similarly,<br>
rather than providing distinct elements distributed<br>
along the outer periphery of the apparatus, the<br>
bearing means of the platform on the frame and/or the<br>
corresponding supporting means may take shapes of<br>
production extending continuously over the periphery<br>
of the apparatus, like the ring 122; for example, the<br>
discal elements 64 may therefore be replaced by an<br>
annular wall centered on the axis Z-Z and<br>
corresponding to the portion of the sphere 66<br>
delimited in dashed lines in figure 6;<br>
- the apparatus may incorporate an opto-kinetic<br>
mechanism, supplying a point of light that the<br>
subject must aim at by looking at it; and/or<br>
- above the apparatus, a suspension of the bar or ball<br>
type may be provided to carry out proprioceptive and<br>
muscular exercises.<br>

The invention concerns an apparatus (1) comprising a chassis (10) supported on<br>
the ground (S), a mobile platform (44) supporting a subject, and motorized<br>
means (30, 32, 38) for driving the platform relative to the chassis. In order to put<br>
the subject off balance while moving its lifting polygon, so as to act on the<br>
subject's body according to advanced kinematics, the driving means are capable<br>
of moving the platform off-center relative to a substantially vertical fixed axis (Z-Z)<br>
and of driving the platform in rotation about said axis when the platform is<br>
off-center, whereas the platform is provided with peripheral mobile supporting<br>
means (60, 62) on corresponding bearing means (64) secured to the chassis (10),;<br>
said supporting means being capable of resting the platform on the chassis by<br>
adjustably inclining same relative to the horizontal in a plane passing through<br>
the fixed axis and a central region of the platform when the driving means move<br>
the platform off-center relative to said axis. The apparatus thus generates<br>
remarkable neuro-biomechanical actions, while having a reliable lightweight and<br>
compact structure.</td>
