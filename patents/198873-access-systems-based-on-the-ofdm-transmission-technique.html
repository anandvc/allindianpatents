				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of Wireless Data Communications. More particularly, this invention relates to a Multi-user Indoor Wireless Access Method and System based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing transmission technique. The envisaged application is the high bit-rate downlink of indoor wireless access systems.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Most high-speed indoor wireless access systems are based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission technique due to its various advantages. In a multi-user indoor wireless access system, the downlink is considered to be the more crucial and important link, as there will be a requirement for high data rates in such an application. Typically internet access is a target application wherein more data is expected to come in the downlink rather than in the uplink. In wireless communications, spectrum or frequency is a key resource which needs efficient and careful allocation so that user requirements are met. The allocation problem becomes crucial as users of wireless systems demand more data rates; typically the situation wherein most of the internet access is through wireless might not be a far-fetched idea. Moreover, in wireless data applications, user requirements can be asymmetric and consequently intelligent and efficient resource (frequency, power) allocation techniques are needed to achieve high-capacity systems. Also, radiated power is an important factor as more wireless systems are used in the field.<br>
Focus of this invention is on OFDM systems, which have been found to be suitable for high data-rate transmission in wireless environments. Methods such as 'adaptive modulation and multiple access for the OFDM transmission technique' and 'multiÂ¬user OFDM with adaptive subcarrier, bit and power allocation' have been presented wherein approaches, which can be used to allocate subcarriers in an OFDM based multi-user system are detailed. A formulation has been presented to calculate the<br><br>
analytical solution in a multi-user system so as to optimize power transmitted from the base station in the method for multiuser OFDM with adaptive subcarrier, bit and power allocation. Here, global channel knowledge is used to allocate subcarriers and modulation mode for the various users in the downlink transmission. Schemes have also been outlined in the adaptive modulation and multiple access for the OFDM transmission technique for subcarrier and modulation mode allocation. In this proposal fixed frequency resources are assigned to the users and modulation mode is varied. Various ways are outlined for allocating the resources considering the user requirements in the method for 'transmit optimization for OFDM/SDMA-based WLAN'. A thorough analysis of the allocation problem is carried out in the method for 'transmit power adaptation for multiuser OFDM systems' and it has been shown that subcarrier sharing results in interference problems. The authors propose allocating subcarriers to the strongest user and then equally distributing the power among the different subcarriers. The focus is on maximizing the net data rate as seen from all the users. It is noted that as the number of users increase, the net data rate exceeds the conventional channel capacity limits.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
There are no existing systems which have considered the allocation of subcamers and modulation mode in a joint manner for an OFDM based multiuser system such that the total power transmitted is minimized. Such a system is important in wireless communications where radiated power has to be kept low while satisfying user requirements. In the method for multiuser OFDM with adaptive subcarrier, bit and power allocation, a formulation is presented to calculate the analytical soluUon in a multi-user system so as to optimize power transmitted from the base station. The analytical solution is not realizable as it involves sharing of the subcarriers which is not feasible. Schemes have been outlined in the adaptive modulation and multiple access for the OFDM transmission technique for subcarrier and modulation mode allocation. However, the method presented does not consider the BER and BR requirements of the various users. It allocates fixed resources to the various resources. In practice, it is expected that the user requirements (in terms of the BER and BR) will be different. Schemes have been described in the method for 'transmit<br><br>
optimization for OFDM/SDMA-based WLAN for subcarrier allocation exploiting the channel conditions. Specifically, the Fonward subcarrier allocation algorithm in which allocation is done to the user who is most benefited by the best subcarrier and the Backward subcarrier allocation algorithm in which allocation is done to the user who is least affected by the worst subcarrier have been mentioned. However, the outlined schemes do not consider optimising any transmitter resource (Power, BR, or BER), In the method for 'transmit power adaptation for multiuser OFDM systems', a system is proposed wherein frequency resources are allocated to users whose channel gains are the best for that particular subcarrier and power is equally distributed to all the subcarriers. This proposal does not address the allocation problem with the transmitted power in perspective; it is designed to achieve rate maximization with no constraints to satisfy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Orthogonal Frequency Division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission technique is used for communications between the base station (BS) and the terminals. This technique has become popular recently for providing high data rate multimedia services over severe multi path channels. In such channels, transmission of high data rate signals using conventional single carrier techniques can result in severe Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and a consequent increase in the equalizer complexity. In such environments, OFDM systems offer low-complexity solutions and several new standards have adopted this technique. OFDM is a multi-carrier transmission scheme. It transmits data in parallel through several subcarriers. It also offers flexibility in multiple access by suitably dividing it among several users.<br>
In one OFDM symbol, the data is modulated using 'N' subcarriers and when there are multiple users, each user may be allotted a set of subcarriers, i.e., the transmission of the data to a particular user can take place using the allotted set of subcarriers. This is illustrated using the OFDM Time-Frequency Grid shown in Figure 2.<br>
MOTIVATION FOR ADAPTIVE ALLOCATION AND MODULATION<br>
In a multi-user system, the channel response from the base station to each of the users is different. Also, the channel response among the different subcarriers for a single user may differ because of the frequency-selective nature of the multipath transmission channel and the large bandwidth of the system. In Figure 3, the channel response in the frequency domain for the 2-user case is shown.<br>
Hence, depending on the channel response, the possible adaptations are Adaptively allocate the subcarriers to the users; Adaptively select the modulation mode among the allocated subcarriers.<br><br>
We consider only the downlink of the multiple access system as it is expected that the requirements for the downlink will be challenging in terms of data rates. The uplink transmission can be based on any of the standard multiple access techniques.<br>
ALLOCATION OF SUBCARRIERS, MODULATION MODE AND POWER<br>
A method is outlined to assign subcarriers, modulation type, and power to each user depending on the channel conditions and requirements of all users. The basic philosophy of the method is as follows: In OFDM systems using adaptive modulation the modulation type employed on each subcarrier is different depending on the individual channel Signal to Noise Ratio (SNRs). Hence, the number of Bits Per Modulation Symbol (BPMS) transmitted in individual subcarriers are different based on the modulation type. The transmitted power needed to achieve a certain BER is different for the various modulation types. Hence, the power difference in transmitting x+1 and x BPMS on a subcarrier for a certain user can be calculated. Consider the condition wherein a certain subcarrier has been assigned to a user and it has been assigned x BPMS for transmission in the subcarrier. In this algorithm, we allocate an extra bit to that subcarrier vi/hich requires the least power to transmit one extra bit. Here Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) with square signal constellation is considered and the function fâ(c) denotes the required received power level for reliable transmission of c BPMS and is given by<br>
where.<br>
EXPLANATION OF THE METHOD<br>
The method works as follows:<br><br>
Let ^ Pn.t for n^1....N and k=l..K, be an W x K matrix whose elements contain the transmit power required to transmit the specified modulation type in the corresponding subcarrier for all the users. Let Mc be the maximum number of subcarriers that can be allocated to any user. It is given by,<br>
Mc = floor(N/K)	(3)<br>
Let f^Â«,* represent the number of BPMS used and '",* is a variable used to keep track of the current constellation size for computational purposes.<br>

FLOW CHART OF THE ALLOCATION SCHEME<br>
The flow chart for the allocation scheme is represented in Figure 4.<br>
After the allocation method finishes, Cn,h gives the number of bits to be transmitted in the nth subcarrier of the ^('^ subcarrier and Pn,/
TRANSMITTER SYSTEM<br>
The transmitter contains 2 blocks as shown in Figure 5. The allocation method outlined in the previous section is used to calculate the subcarrier, modulation mode and power to the subcarriers. The information about the channel conditions can be obtained using vahous methods. The QOS requirements of the users in terms of BER and BR for each user have to be supplied. The allocation block will then supply the resource allocation output to the OFDM transmitter section. The bits for the intended users are then modulated accordingly by using the modulation mode and subcarrier allocation information and are transmitted through an antenna. A control channel is used to transmit the allocation information to all the users. The allocation can be repeated after any number of OFDM symbols depending on the changes in the environment and user requirements.<br>
The transmitter in the downlink does the combined subcarrier and modulation mode allocation as shown in figure 9 using the following steps:<br>
â¢	The  channel  information  of all  users  is  obtained   by the   base  station transmitter by sending 2 Pilot OFDM symbols in every frame.<br>
â¢	In addition, the base station transmitter also specifies the users to whom data is to be sent in the following frame.<br><br>
â¢	The active users who are listening to the radio transmissions from the base<br>
station report back the channel status in pre-assigned time slots at the end of<br>
the frame.<br>
â¢	Based on the number of users who have responded and the channel state<br>
.information reported by the respective users, the base station transmitter<br>
assigns the subcarrier and modulation mode so as to minimize the transmit power as outlined in the method.<br>
The operations that need to be completed at the base station transmitter system are outlined in the steps and flowcharts given. The mathematical operations that are used in the system are additions and multiplications. In our system, a general purpose microprocessor shall be programmed with these equations and the output is the allocation information for the following frame. This information is supplied to the control processor of the base station which uses this information to select number of bits in each user stream and to route it to the correct subcarrier.<br>
RECEIVER SYSTEM<br>
The receiver for the m*^ terminal (in general, it could be any one of the K terminals) contains an antenna and an OFDM receiver block as shown in figure 6. The output of the OFDM receiver block is sent to an adaptive demodulator. The adaptive demodulator uses the control channel information about the allocation of the subcarriers and the modulation mode to demodulate the information in the subcarriers, which were allocated for transmitting its signal.<br>
PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES OF THE PROPOSED SCHEME<br>
We have compared the performance of the new scheme with other multiple access schemes. Shown below are the BER Vs Eb/No curves for the different schemes under different channel conditions. These curves clearly elucidate the advantages of the new scheme. We gain around 3 dB by using the new allocation algorithm compared to the OFDM - TDt\/lA scheme. The proposed scheme for minimizing the<br><br>
total transmit power can be easily modified to achieve the maximum throughput when the transmit power is l<ept constant.></ept>

(e)	allocation to accommodate different bit-rate and bit-error rate requirements from the different users.<br><br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the adaptive modulation for the<br>
various sub-carriers allocated to a user "w" is accomplished using the<br>
following method:<br>
if the number of subcarriers allocated to the user w is equal to M^ i.e.<br><br>
3.	The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, which is capable of<br>
accommodating users with varying bit-rate and bit-error rate requirements at<br>
any given time.<br>
4.	A multi-user indoor wireless access system based on the OFDM transmission<br>
technique inter alia comprising;<br>
(a)	a base station which is connected to multiple users and the downlink is<br>
effected through OFDM;<br>
(b)	a transmitter system which, inter alia, comprises an allocation scheme<br>
module, a modulation block module and an OFDM transmitter module; and<br>
(c)	a receiver system which comprises at least an OFDM receiver module<br>
connected to an adaptive demodulation block.<br>
5.	The system as claimed in claim 4, wherein the said OFDM is a multi-carrier<br>
transmission scheme where data is transmitted in parallel through several<br>
subcarriers which offers flexibility in multiple access by suitably dividing the<br>
said subcarriers among several users.<br>
6.	The system as claimed in claims 4 &amp; 5, wherein depending on the channel<br>
response, the adaptations adaptively allocate the subcarriers to the users and<br>
adaptively select the modulation mode among the allocated subcarriers.<br><br>
7.	The system as claimed in claims 4 to 6, wherein in the said transmitter system the QOS requirements of the users in terms of BER and BR for each user have to be supplied and further the allocation block will supply the resource allocation output to the OFDM transmitter section.<br>

11.	The system as claimed In claims 4 to 10, wherein the channel information of any and / or all users is obtained by the base station transmitter by sending at least 2 Pilot OFDM symbols in every frame.<br><br>
12.	The system as claimed in claims 4 to 11, wherein the base station transmitter further specifies the users to whom data is to be sent in the following frame and the active users who are listening to the radio transmissions from the base station report back the channel status in pre-assigned time slots at the end of the frame.<br>
13.	The system as claimed in claims 4 to 12, wherein based on the number of users who have responded and the channel state information reported by the respective users, the base station transmitter assigns the subcarrier and modulation mode so as to minimize the transmit power.<br><br>
14.	The system as claimed in claims 4 to 13, wherein a general purpose microprocessor is programmed with the required mathematical equations and the output is the allocation information for the following frame which is supplied to the control processor of the base station which uses this information to select number of bits in each user stream and to route it to the correct subcarrier.<br>
15.	The system as claimed in claims 4 to 14, wherein in the receiver system the output of the OFDM receiver block is sent to an adaptive demodulator and the adaptive demodulator uses the control channel information about the allocation of the subcarriers and the modulation mode to demodulate the information in the subcarriers, which were allocated for transmitting its signal.<br>
16.	A multi-user indoor wireless access system based on the OFDM transmission technique in which the method as claimed in claims 1 to 3 is implemented.<br>
17.	A multi-user indoor wireless access method based on the OFDM transmission technique as claimed in the preceding claims and as substantially described and illustrated herein.<br>
