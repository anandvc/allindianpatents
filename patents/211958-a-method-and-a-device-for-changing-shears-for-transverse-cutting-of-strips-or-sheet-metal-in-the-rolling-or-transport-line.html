Translation of Amended Pages ("Druckexemplar") of WO 00/05019 (PCT/EP99/05115)<br>
Method and Device for Exchanging Shears in the Cutting to Length of Strips or Sheets in the Rolling or Transport Line<br>
The invention relates to a method for exchanging shears in the<br>
getting to length of strips or sheet metal in a rolling or<br>
transport line, in particular, on a rolling table, with blade<br>
holders one being positioned above and one being positioned below<br>
the strip, which blade holders are guided by means of holding<br>
elements. The invention also relates to a device for performing the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
enternal ro the Strip width, can be positively connected for the<br>
purpose of receiving the shearing forces.<br><br><br>
holder and the lower blade holder of the shears are positioned so in to freely project above and below the strip or the sheet metal,<br><br><br>
Fig. 4   in a front view the shears with coupling rods for the coupling of the machine frame of the shears;<br>
Fig. 5   in a side view the front part of the shears with a<br>
foldable clamping element;<br>
Fig. 6   in a front view the shears with the foldable clamping element according to Fig. 5.<br>
The device illustrated in Fig 1 for cutting to length strips 1 or<br>
sheet metal in the rolling line x~x, in particular, on a rolling<br>
table 2, shows the shears 3 in a position shortly before performing<br>
a cut, with arms 22, 29 of its machine frame 20 still open.  The<br>
shears 3 have a drive apparatus 8 with reducing gear 8' as well as<br>
a synchronization gear 12 flanged onto the frame 20.  The shears 3<br>
are moveable, inclusive of its drive apparatus, by means of a drive<br>
10 and a drive carriage 9 guided on rails transverse to the rolling<br>
or transport line x-x.  The drive carriage 9 is coupled with a<br>
movable part 2' of the rolling table 2 and is moved together with<br>
the shears 3 such that it is positioned external to the rolling<br>
line x-x when the shears 3,  as illustrated in Fig.  1,  are<br>
positioned in the rolling line x-x and, conversely, is rejoined<br>
again with the rolling table 2 when the shears 3 are moved out.<br>
As also illustrated in Fig. 1, at the rolling table side at least one clamping element 7 with actuating members 11, 25, 30, 36 is arranged. The actuating members in the present embodiment are hydraulic piston-cylinder units and are referred to as force means. On the rolling table side of the frame arms 22, 29, the holding elements 6, 6' overlapping the rolling line x-x are provided which<br><br>
receive bearings (not illustrated) for oppositely rotatable rotors of the blade holders 4, 4'.<br>
In the drive side area of the machine frame 20, identical holding elements 5, 5' are provided which also receive the drive side bearings of the blade holders 4, 4'.<br>
The U-shaped open side of the machine frame 20 has correlated therewith the clamping element 7 for coupling the holding elements 6, 6 at the rolling table side. According to the illustration in Figs* 2 and 3, this clamping element 7 is configured for a positive and non-positive connection of the holding elements 6, 6'.<br>
According to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, a hydraulic force means 11 is provided for lifting the clamping element 7 into the gliding paths 26' 26' or for lifting it out of it. Moreover, the Figs. 2 and 3 show that the holding element 6 has two pressure plates 23, 23 â€¢ at the free end of the upper, horizontal frame arm 22, that the clamping element 7 has congruent gliding plates 24, 24', that the holding element 6' has two pressure plates 37, 37', and that the clamping element 7 has congruent gliding plates 38, 38' . The clamping element 7 is slidable by force means 25, 25' on a horizontal gliding path 26, 26' with its gliding plates 24, 24' and 38, 38' across the pressure plates 23, 23' and 37, 37' for generating a positive and non-positive coupling.<br>
In Fig. 4 an alternative embodiment of the coupling device between the upper frame arm 22 and the lower frame arm 29 of the machine frame 20 of the shears 3 is illustrated. In this connection, it is provided that the securing element 6 is embodied at the free end of<br><br>
the upper horizontal frame arm 22 with coupling rods 32, 32' with spindle drive 31, wherein the coupling rods are connected to be pivotal to both sides.<br>
The coupling rods 32, 32' can be engaged via lower recesses 21, 27' and 39, 39' by congruent coupling sockets 28, 28' and 40, 40' of the lower frame arm 29 of the machine frame 20 and are adjustable by a force means 30. The coupling rods 32, 32' are moved with the aid of their spindle drives 31, 31' into the position in which the recesses 39, 39' rests against the coupling sockets 40, 40' for generating a positive and non-positive connection.<br>
In addition, Fig. 4 shows in an illustrative way the configuration of the drive carriage 9 with wheel flanges 13, 13' on the guide rails 14, 14' .<br>
A further alternative configuration of the connection at the open<br>
side of the shears 3 is illustrated in Figs- 5 and 6.  In this<br>
embodiment, the clamping element 7 arranged transversely to the<br>
arms 22, 29 of the machine frame 20 is formed with a joint 34 with<br>
pivot axis 35 extending parallel to the rolling line. With the aid<br>
of the force means 36, 36', the clamping element 7 is folded<br>
upwardly for coupling the two frame arms 22, 29 and is folded<br>
downwardly for canceling the coupling position.   The clamping<br>
element 7 which can be folded up or down as well as the coordinated<br>
force means 36, 36' are arranged on the drive carriage 9.  In this<br>
configuration, the lower pressure plates 23, 23' in the closed<br>
position interact with the glide plates 24, 24' that can be moved<br>
on top of them and this results in a positive as well as non-<br><br>
positive connection of the two arms 22 and 29 of the machine frame<br>
20.<br>
The different configurations show flying or stationary shears for cutting to length strips or sheet metal which shears can be moved in and out of the rolling line or the rolling table while the strip<br>
1	or the sheet metal is moved in the line x-x on the rolling table<br>
2	in the rolling table direction or is standing still- Because the shears are moved in only directly before the cut, the rolling table remains open in the upward direction and can remain freely accessible after mounting of the shears. The shears can be serviced outside of the line and/ in the case of a disruption, can be moved quickly out of the line.<br><br>
