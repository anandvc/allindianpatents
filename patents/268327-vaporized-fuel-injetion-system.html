				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
VAPORIZED FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
[0001]     This invention relates to fuel delivery systems and methods. More particularly, this invention relates to systems and methods for vaporizing fuel for delivery in combustion engines.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
[0002]     Fuel injection systems are commonly used to deliver fuel in many modern<br>
engines because of a number of well-known advantages, such as their ability to<br>
efficiently and accurately meter fuel flow and the mixture of fuel and air (air/fuel ratio)<br>
delivered to an engine. Fuel injection systems can dramatically improve engine<br>
performance while reducing engine exhaust gas emissions.<br>
[0003]     Vaporized or heated fuel delivery systems are also known for improving<br>
the efficiency of combustion engines. Once such system is described in U.S. patent<br>
6,415,775 B1. This patent describes a vaporized fuel delivery system for<br>
combustion engines that requires a bubbler fuel tank in order to produce a source of<br>
vaporized fuel. The fuel is pulled into the intake port of the combustion source by<br>
vacuum.<br>
[0004]     However, the prior art system is designed for engine with a carburetor fuel<br>
supply system. The fuel processor of the prior art system thus has a number of<br>
disadvantages. First, it cannot effectively heat the fuel vapor to increase its internal<br>
energy for fuel economy and reduced emission. Second, the system cannot heat the<br>
fuel vapor to exert high pressure for fuel injection purposes. Third, the system<br>
cannot efficiently produce enough preheated, pressurized fuel vapor swiftly for fuel<br>
injection.<br>
[0005]     Thus, there is a need for new and improved vaporized fuel delivery<br>
systems that address and solve the problems associated with prior art systems with<br>
the following advantages:<br>
1)	Breaking up gasoline fuel to its smallest molecular size via<br>
vaporization process to maximize the total surface area for chemical<br>
reaction process, namely combustion process. In this way, reaction<br>
rate increases and energy released during combustion will also<br>
increase drastically.<br>
2)	Igniting gasoline fuel in gaseous state at high temperature, and<br>
combustion process of fuel will be complete with no un-burnt<br>
hydrocarbon left behind. Therefore, power output will be maximized<br>
and air pollution will be minimized.<br><br>
3)	Utilizing heat loss from radiator/ exhaust pipe/ engine block to vaporize<br>
gasoline fuel, and heat being added to the fuel vaporization chamber<br>
will effectively increase the internal energy of gasoline fuel without<br>
increasing load to alternator or engine such as using electric heating<br>
coil. As a result, energy released during combustion in the combustion<br>
chamber will substantially increase.<br>
4)	Injecting lesser amount of vaporized fuel, as compared with fuel in<br>
liquid form, into combustion chamber without affecting performance in<br>
normal driving condition.<br>
5) Injecting equivalent or higher amount of vaporized fuel, as compared with fuel in liquid form, into engine combustion chamber to increase acceleration rate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
[0006]     According to an embodiment of the present invention, a vaporized fuel injection system for a combustion engine is provided. The system includes a fuel vaporization chamber and a two-way valve. The fuel vaporization chamber has a first input and a first output, and is connected with a fuel source via the first input. The fuel vaporization chamber vaporizes fuel input to the first input and outputs vaporized fuel to the first output. The two-way valve has first and second valve inputs and an valve output. The first valve input is connected to the first output of the fuel vaporization chamber, and the second valve input is connected to the fuel source. The two-way valve is switchable to allow fuel to flow from only one of the first or second valve inputs to the valve output.<br>
[0007]     According to another embodiment of the present invention, a vaporized fuel injection system is provided. The system includes a fuel vaporization chamber means for storing fuel to be heated, a first flow-controlling means for controlling fuel flowing into the chamber, a second flow-controlling means for controlling heated-up gaseous fuel flowing out of the chamber, and a heating means for heating up fuel in the chamber. The fuel in the fuel vaporization chamber means is heated up to a gaseous state and is fed to a combustion engine combustion chamber under control of the first and second flow-controlling means.<br>
[0008]     According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for heating up fuel to high-temperature, high-pressure gaseous state for injection into a<br>
combustion engine is provided. The combustion engine includes a combustion chamber, a fuel source and a vaporization chamber. The method comprises a step of heating said vaporization chamber. When a temperature of the vaporization chamber reaches a predetermined temperature value, fuel is allowed to flow into the vaporization chamber from the fuel source. When a pressure of the vaporization chamber reaches a predetermined pressure value, the fuel is allowed to flow from the vaporization chamber to the combustion chamber.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS:<br>
40014]     Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a fuel injection system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fuel injection system 100a is configured to operate with a combustion engine, such as a gasoline combustion engine.   Fuel injection system 100a includes a fuel vaporization chamber 3 connected to a fuel source, i.e., fuel pump (not shown) via a pressurized fuel line at an inlet (chamber input) via fuel injector valve 2. The fuel vaporization chamber 3 is also connected to a two-way valve 4 at an outlet (chamber outputs) thereof. The two-way valve 4 may be for example, a Y-valve, and includes two inlets (value inputs) and one outlet (valve output), and limits the flow from one of the inlets to the outlet. [0015]     The pressurized fuel line branches upstream of the fuel injector valve 2 into a liquid mode branch 7, which connects to the second input of two-way valve 4. The outlet of two-way valve 4 is connected to a fuel injector 1 of the combustion engine. Accordingly, pressurized fuel can be fed to the two-way valve 4 via fuel vaporization chamber 3 or directly via the liquid mode branch 7. The two-way valve 4 is switchable to limit the flow to the fuel injector 1 from either the fuel vaporization chamber 3 or directly from the liquid mode branch 7.<br>
[0016]     One will readily understand that the above system can be modified for a variety of configurations, and the embodiments described herein are not meant to limit the invention. For example, the vaporized fuel injection system may be duplicated for each fuel injector jet in a combustion engine, or configured to use one or more common vaporization chambers for all fuel injector jets. Also, the two-way valve and fuel injector 1 in figure 1 can be replaced by using a bi-fue' injector. US patent* 6,431,471 B2, that accepts gasoline in liquid form and in vapor form. Initially, the bi-fuel injector injects fuel into combustion chamber in liquid form. When vapor pressure in the vaporized fuel chamber increases to above that of fuel in liquid form,<br>
 the pressure differential causes a switchover between two fuel supply channels to inject fuel in pressurized vapor form into combustion chamber for combustion. [0017]     Fuel vaporization chamber 3 may be a pressure controlled chamber and configured to heat / vaporize fuels, such as gasoline or propane. Heat may be supplied to the fuel vaporization chamber 3 from a variety of heat sources, such as the engine block, a radiator, exhaust piping, other heat exchangers, etc. Fuel injector valve 2 may be a conventional valve, or a fuel injector having means of spraying fuel into the chamber for more complete fuel vaporization and heating. [001 8]     An electronic control unit (ECU) 1 0 is configured to communicate with and control various subsystems of the engine, including the fuel delivery system. Accordingly, ECU 1 0 includes subcomponents such as a memory unit or EPROM 10a for storing system set-points and configuration data, an analog to digital A/D converter 10b, a processor or control module 10c, and a digital to analog D/A converter 10d. ECU 10 may be coupled with and configured to receive data from a temperature sensor 5 and a pressure sensor 6, which respectively measure temperature and pressure of the vaporization chamber 3. Accordingly, temperature sensor 5 and a pressure sensor 6 may be disposed appropriately within the system to perform such measurements.<br>
[0019]     ECU 10 is coupled with and configured to control two-way valve 4, fuel injector valve 2, and fuel injector 1 , in order to align fuel flow paths of system 1 00a. One having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that the constitution of ECU 10 may vary to incorporate modern computing architecture. [0020]     Operational details of system 100a are described next with additional reference to the flowchart in Fig. 2. After the engine is started, the current temperature T1 inside the vaporized fuel chamber 3 is determined at step S2-1 , via<br>
temperature sensor 5. When the temperature T1 of fuel vaporization chamber 3 is below a predetermined value Tp (e.g., low at engine start-up), the system is set to liquid-mode fuel injection mode, at step S2-3. In this mode, ECU 10 performs a valve alignment to establish the liquid mode flow path, at step S2-4.   Accordingly, passage from the fuel vaporization chamber 3 to fuel injector 1 is shut off, and two-way valve 4 is aligned so that liquid fuel from the liquid branch 7 is fed to fuel injector 1 . Fuel injector / valve 2 is controlled to be inactive at this moment, and no fuel is injected into the fuel vaporization chamber 3 for vaporization. Liquid mode may be the default system alignment at start-up, and therefore, the alignment may have already been performed and steps S2-3 and S2-4 would be skipped. Processing then returns to step S2-1 to monitor the temperature and is repeated. [0021]     After the fuel vaporization chamber 3 is heated up to a predetermined temperature Tp (i.e., adequate to vaporize the fuel), it will be determined that T1 is greater than Tp at step S3-2 and processing will proceed to step S2-5. [0022]     At step S2-5, ECU 1 0 turns on the fuel injector / valve 2, and fuel is injected to the vaporization chamber 3. This continues in liquid fuel mode until the pressure P1 in the chamber 3 is high enough due to vapor pressure of fuel.  At step S2-6, the pressure is measured within the chamber 3 (i.e., by polling pressure sensor 6). If the measured pressure P1 is greater than a predetermined pressure Pp, then it is determined that the system is ready for vaporized fuel injection. Then, at step S2-8, ECU 10 enters gas-mode fuel injection and performs a valve alignment to switch to the gas mode flow path, at step S2-9. ECU 10 opens the passage from the vaporization fuel chamber 3 to the fuel injector 1 by switching two-way valve 4, allowing vaporized fuel (gasoline in vapor) to be injected into the engine for combustion, and prohibiting liquid fuel from entering the fuel injector 1.<br>
[0023]     One having ordinary skill will readily understand that fuels like propane are already in gaseous form, and the above method may also be used to heat up the fuel to hot, gaseous form for better combustion to increase fuel economy. Tp and Pp may be set appropriately depending on the fuel type, fuel grade, engine requirements, etc.<br>
[0024]     According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a mechanically controlled vaporized fuel delivery system as shown in Fig. 3. In this embodiment, System 100b includes the same basic components as 100a, and the same method steps are performed as shown in Fig. 2, except that no ECU is necessary to control the switching from liquid mode to gas mode because mechanically driven valves are used (e.g., pressure relief valves, etc.). Accordingly, two-way valve 4 is pressure controlled and fuel injector / valve 2 is temperature controlled.<br>
[0025]     When pressure of fuel vaporization chamber 3 is low (P1<pp passage from the fuel vaporization chamber to injector via pressure-controlled two-way valve is shut off at position of and normal mode injection active. pp trigger pressure for opening or switching assuming that temperature t1 in below a predetermined tp temperature-controlled not active this moment no injected into vaporization.></pp>
[0026]     After engine start-up, fuel vaporization chamber 3 is heated up from the heating source, and the temperature T1 of fuel vaporization chamber 3 increases. When temperature is high enough and reaches a predetermined temperature Tp, the temperature-controlled valve / injector 2 is turned on, which allows fuel to be injected<br>
into the vaporization chamber 3. Tp is the trip / set temperature of the temperaturecontrolled valve / injector 2.<br>
[0027]     Fuel vapor pressure in the chamber 3 will increase as fuel is injected into the chamber and heated. When the pressure of the fuel vaporization chamber P1 reaches or exceeds the predetermined level Pp (i.e., high enough for vapor mode), the pressure-controlled two-way valve 4 switches to position 4b and opens the passage from the fuel vaporization chamber 3 to the fuel injector 1. Thus, high-temperature, high-pressure vaporized fuel (gasoline) is injected into the engine for combustion.<br>
[0028]     One having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand how to implement temperature and pressure driven control valves.   It will be understood that Tp and Pp may be set based on the fuel type, fuel grade, engine type, etc. It will also be understood that the size and number of vaporization chambers may be varied as desired. Preferably, the temperature, Tp, is set as high as possible and is close to, but lower than, the valve opening temperature of the engine thermostat. In this way, engine heat will be used to heat up fuel before the radiator fan is turned on and heat is dissipated, unless, of course, a separate heater than the engine block is used to heat the fuel.<br>
[0029]     A compressor can be added downstream of the vaporization chamber to compress the vaporized fuel prior to injection, as shown in Fig. 4. The system 100c of Fig. 4 is identical to that shown in Fig. 1, except that fuel in fuel vaporization chamber 3 is output to a compressor connected to an insulated fuel chamber 7, which is connect to the two-way valve 4. The two-way valve 4 may have a pressure regulator built-in.<br>
[0030]     Similar to the embodiments above, after the fuel vaporization chamber 3 is heated up from heating sources like engine block, radiator, exhaust and etc., and the temperature of said chamber 3 reaches the minimum temperature Tp required, liquid-mode injection is entered and fuel flows into fuel vaporization chamber 3. However, when minimum pressure Pp is established in the fuel vaporization chamber 3 and ECU 10 enters gas-mode fuel injection, the compressor 8 is actuated to draw and compress fuel vapor from the chamber 3 into insulated fuel chamber 7, to a higher pressure. When a desired pressure (second predetermined pressure) for fuel injection is reached in insulated fuel chamber 7, the two-way valve 4 switches to position 1, to allow vaporized fuel (gasoline in vapor) to be injected for combustion. [0031]     If necessary, the insulated fuel chamber 7 can be installed with a second pressure sensor (not shown) to send a pressure signal to ECU 10 for deactivating compressor 8 based on the pressure in the insulated fuel chamber 7, (i.e., when a maximum pressure is met in the insulated fuel chamber 7) and also for switching position of the two-way valve 4.<br>
[0032]     Thus, the present invention has been fully described with reference to the drawing figures. Although the invention has been described based upon these preferred embodiments, it would be apparent to those of skilled in the art that certain modifications, variations, and alternative constructions would be apparent, while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
[0033]     For example, when the system enters the vaporized fuel mode, air/fuel mixture changes and oxygen control system may be configured to change correspondingly to achieve the best performance. However, this can also be done without having oxygen control system to react correspondingly when entering<br>
-vaporized fuel mode by increasing or decreasing the injection time to control the exact amount of fuel being injected to the combustion chamber via ECU.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
