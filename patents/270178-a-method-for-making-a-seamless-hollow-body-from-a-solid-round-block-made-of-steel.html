METHOD OF MAKING A SEAMLESS HOLLOW BODY FROM STEEL<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method for making a seamless hollow body from steel according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The manufacture of a seamless hollow body from a solid round block of steel typically involves cross rolling by which a piercing mandrel is held between the inclined rolls to so adjust the round block that the roll distance is smaller in the narrowest cross section by 10-12% than the diameter of the used round block.<br>
The piercing mandrel is positioned with its piercing piece upwardly of the narrowest cross section of the rolls. This plane is also called 'high point'.<br>
The tip of the piercing mandrel is thus positioned before the plane of the smallest roll distance (plane "high point') such that the produced hollow block is free of any internal flaws. The smoothing part and the expansion part of the piercing mandrel (if present) are located behind of the 'high point'. More details are described in "Bander, Bleche, Rohr 6" [Strips, Metal Sheets, Tubes 6], (1965) No. 4, pp. 1840189.<br>
According to this known process, the hollow block diameters range between 5% smaller and significantly greater (&gt; 20%) than the diameter of the used solid round block.<br>
The known process is unsuitable to provide a greatly reducing piercing with the hollow block being free of flaws. Internal flaws are encountered in particular when extruded round blocks are involved.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for making a seamless hollow body from a solid round block of steel by means of cross roiling, by which extruded round blocks can be pierced also with a diametric reduction of &gt; 5% in the absence of any internal flaws.<br><br>
Based on the preamble, this object is solved in combination with the characterizing part of claim 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
According to the teaching of the invention, the extent of the constriction (ratio roll distance to block diameter cold) is not the crucial factor for realizing a piercing that is free of internal flaws; rather it is maintaining a material-dependent and rolling-mill-dependent deformation anteriorly of the mandrel tip. The variables of block and hollow block diameters provide the basis for calculating the guide and/or roll distance according to the given equations. As a result, the position of the mandrel tip is determined with the aid of the deformation limit to be observed anteriorly of the mandrel tip.<br>
Tests have shown that the forming limit X rises as the transport angle increases and the run-in angle decreases. The material dependency is governed by the deformability of the used steel. When simple carbon steels are involved, the forming limit X is greater in comparison to a 13% chrome steel that is hard to shape.<br>
It has been further shown that the ascertained forming limit must be corrected with a correction factor in dependence of the cone angle, with the cone angle being defined as the angle between rolling stock and rolling axis, when the transport angle is zero degree.<br>
When the cone angle is zero degree (barrel piercer), the correction factor is equal 1 and increases above 1 up to a value 
When using a three-roll cross rolling mill, the same dependencies hold true, as described above, with the difference residing only in the increase of the forming limit X by at least the factor 1.2 in comparison to a two-roll cross rolling mill.<br><br>
The configuration of the tools is now a compromise between roll run-in length, roll run-in angle, mandrel length and position of the mandrel tip with consideration of the marginal production parameters.<br>
On one hand, it must be taken into account that the smoothing part of the piercing mandrel has to commence directly at the 'high point' or even in the run-in portion of the inclined roll. On the other hand, a selected roll pass should permit, if possible, the whole range of required shaping because an exchange of inclined rolls is time consuming.<br>
The process according to the invention closes the gap between the currently employed procedure and the process protected in DE 33 269 46 C1 and is applicable for a two-roll cross rolling mill as well as for a three-roll cross rolling mill without guides. DE 332 69 46 C1 discloses for the manufacture of in particular thin-walled hollow bodies without internal flaws and little eccentricity an adjustment of the inclined rolls to a distance in the range of 75 to 60% and an adjustment of the guides to a distance in the range of 85 to 70% of the diameter of the used round block.<br>
The equations for calculating the roll and guide distances are as follows:<br>
Two-roll cross rolling mill:<br>
Roll distance	= diameter hollow block - 0.075 x block diameter<br>
Guide distance        = diameter hollow block + 0.075 x block diameter<br>
Three-roll cross rolling mill:<br>
Roll distance      =3/2 x diameter hollow block -14 x block diameter<br>
As the individual cross rolling mill types and the material to be pierced differ in their flow behavior, the afore-mentioned equations are adequate to be able to check the possibilities to manufacture desired hollow blocks and to configure rolls<br><br>
and the piercing mandrel with good approximation. Good approximation relates hereby to a deviation of 
It is essential that fine tuning permits a change in roll and guide distances as well as piercing mandrel shape, while preventing at the same time that the mandrel tip does not exceed the critical decrease. The forming limit X anteriorly of the mandrel tip is defined as<br><br>
As already stated, the permitted variable X depends on the rolling mill and the material to be pierced. It is recommended to select this variable such that all materials are pierced with the same variable.<br>
The advantage of the proposed method for rolling mills that predominantly produce seamless tubes of up to 200 mm diameter resides in that formats that can be extruded can be used as starting material. Normally, the same roll pass allows piercing from greatly reduced to slightly expanding. As a result, the number of the required round block formats can be significantly reduced.<br>
In this manner, a hollow block with a diameter of 186 mm may, for example, be manufactured from a round block of 220 mm diameter. Normally, this would have required a round block with 180 mm diameter and a slight widening thereof. Or, a hollow block could have only been produced from a round block of 220 mm diameter with slight reduction.<br>
An example for the determination of the roll and guide distances while maintaining a particular forming limit X will now be described.<br><br>
A hollow block having the dimensions 186 x 20 mm should be produced from a<br>
round block of a grade of steel ST 52 with a diameter of 220 mm, using a two-roll<br>
cross rolling mill. The ratio of hollow block diameter to round block diameter<br>
186<br>
establishes a value of 	=0.84, which, as stated, is far below the currently<br>
220 typical value of a minimum of 0.95. The two-roll cross rolling mill uses in this example a barrel piercer with side guards.<br>
As outlined above, this means that the correction factor is equal 1. The transport angle is 10° and the run-in and run-out angles are at 3.5°. This results in a forming limit value X of 6 %. As the diameter of the round block is 220 mm, a roll distance is realized at the position of the mandrel tip of 206.8 mm.<br>
The roll distance in the 'high point' is 186 mm - 0.075 x 220 = 169.5 mm, and the guide distance is 186 mm + 0.075 x 220 = 202.5.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention will be described with reference to a schematic length section. The present half-side length section shows only the upper double-conical inclined roll 1 of the cross rolling mill. The pertaining second inclined roll as well as the pass-closing guides, be it side guards or Diescher disks, that are situated in the other plane of the two-roll cross rolling mill have been omitted for the sake of simplicity.<br>
The plane of the narrowest cross section 2 of the inclined rolls, designated as "high point", is characterized by a dashed line.<br>
Clearly shown is the otherwise uncommon disposition of the piercing mandrel 3 in the first example (Figure 1). The end of the smoothing part 4 is situated before of the 'high point' 2 and thus also the piercer 5. The mandrel tip 6 assumes hereby a position which ensures that the stated forming limit X is maintained in the run-in zone of the round block, and the round block 7 is pierced free of flaws.<br><br>
Characteristic is the great diameter reduction from diameter 8 of the round block 7 to the diameter 9 of the hollow block 10.<br>
When the run-in angle of the roll is changed, as illustrated in the second example (Figure 2), it can be shown that a respective hollow block with reduced diameter can be produced, when the smoothing part of the piercing mandrel is positioned behind the 'high point', while maintaining the permitted deformation before the mandrel tip. According to the illustration of Figure 3, the greater run-in angle causes a slightly smaller forming limit X.<br>
Figure 4 shows the dependency of the correction factor from the cone angle.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
