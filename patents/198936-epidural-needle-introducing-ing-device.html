				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to epidural needle introducer and more particularly, an epidural needle introducing device, capable of being used on patients who need epidiural anaesthesia and post-operative continuous epidiural analgesia.<br>
It is well known that epidural is situated on the outside of 
Now the major detriment of successful epidural anaeshthesia is the looalissation of the epidural space. The manual techmque for loss of resistance** is widely used by anaesthesiologists to identify the epidural space. Method of identifying the epidural space is de8cribedÂ» in which the traditional *loss of resistance technique" to air or saline being practiced. The epidural needle as it traverse through interspinous<br><br>
ligamenta and the ligamentum flavum and then enters the epidural space. Another technique of identifying the epidural space is by using hanging drop technique.<br>
Sometimes the location of epidural space for local anaesthetic irijection or other medications can be difficult with ineseperienoed anaesthetists. Inadvertent puncture of dura mater is quite a common complication, while introducdz^ the epidural needle to localize the epidiural space. Post spinal headache can be complained by the patient due to leak of cerebrospinal fhiid from subarachnoid space. Some of the patients may require a blood patch to close the puncture site of dura mater. So, the smooth control while introducing the epidural needle is very essential. An important cause of inadvertent dural puncture is the use of syringes with plungers that do not move freely. Fine movement of epidural needle is essential with either of the techniques. (Loss of resistance technique or hac^^ing drop technique).<br>
Accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide an epidural needle introducing device which is completely tww and novel in its construction.<br><br>
A ftirther object of the present invention is to provide an epidural needle introducing device with which a fine movement of epidural needle is possible with either loss of resistance technique or hanging drop technique.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an epidural needle introducing device which has a amooth control while introducing the ^dural needle.<br>
Yet, another object of the present invention is to provide an epidural needle introducing device which is very easy to operate, even inexperienced anaesthetists may operate it without any puncture of dura mater.<br>
A atm fiirther ot^ect of the present invention la to provide an epidural needle introducii^ device wherein major parts are made of stainless steel, stronger in its construction, rustproof, lighter in its weight and cheaper in original coata.<br>
Keeping the above objecta in mind, the present invention thua providea an epidural needle introducing device comprising introducer back support, fitted with a<br><br>
hollow connulated groved screw having fine spirally grooved on its outer periphery, a fine needle advancer with corresponding grooves rotatably sliding over said screw, a graded guider permanently fixed to the said back support, a needle hub support with a needle hub fixator screw being adjusted Into the said graded guider and a three way stop cook.<br>
The said epidural needle introducing device of the present invention is made of stainless steel and teflon, thus rust prodT and durable. Mco-eover the whole device may be configured into any shape dependiz^ upon requirement and choice.<br>
The said device in addition to being useful in difficult epidurals and as an exellent teaching aid can tdBO be modified for thoracis epidural space identification.<br>
For a better understanding of the nature of this invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect (operated), reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Figure I : Shows side sectional view of the epidural needle introducing device According to the present invention as it is being operated in the body of a patient.<br><br>
The description of the invention made hereunder which now follows is made in relation to figure I wherein an epidural needle introducing device comprises on introducer back support (9) zaade of teflon whose all ports can be separated for easy cleaning and autodavable, a fine needle advances (10) made of stainless steel, can be autoclaved and is grooved so as to rotatably slide over a hollow connulated grooved screw (12) througih which the needle (17) passes, a graded guider (11) made up of stainless steel, is permanently fixed to the said introducer back support and helps in two ways: namely, it guides anaesthetist, the distance through which the epidural needle is advanced and it gives stability to the needle is advanced and it gives stabilily to the needle hub support (14) fitted to distal and which accommodates the flanges of epidural needle, at the same time it gives provision for needle hub fixator screw (13), and a three way stop cock (15) is attached to said epidural needle hub.<br>
Now to show how the epidural needle introducing device of the present may be carried into effect or operated, reference is again made to figure I wherein first the area of puncture site is identified and all aseptic precautions are being followed according<br><br>
to hospital protocol. Epidural needle from air (or) fluid filled syringe is introduced through the epidural introducer and hub of the needle is Oxsd with the help of needle hub fixator screw (13). Needle hub support (14) is adjusted into the grade guider (11). Fine needle advancer (10) is threaded into the proximal grooves of cannulated grooved screw (12). Initial 1.5 cms or 2 cms. of the epidwal needle is introduced throu^ the puncture site and introducer back support rest on the patienfis back and the same is well firmly supported by the hand. The very fine controller is rotated anticlockwise so that the epidural needle is gradual^ advanced about one to two cms. more. The stylet of the epidural needle is removed. Proximal port of three way stop cock (15) is attached to the hub epidural needle. Distal port is fixed to an air filled or fluid filled glass syringe. (5 ml or 10 ml. glass syringe can be selected). Vertical port of the three way stop-cock is filled with few drops of fluid and the Distal port is temporarily blocked. Now the fluid filled vertical port of three way stop- cook is in line with epidural needle channel. Fine needle advancer is rotated slowly in anticlockwise, whole observing the fluid in vertical port of three way stop-cock. As the 
 <br>
pierces the ligamentum flavum. (6) and then the epidural space (5) the fluid in the vortical port of the three way stop cock is sucked (aspirated), hi case the fluid is not sucked (aspirated) the loss of resistance technique can be used with the help of air filled or fluid filled glass syringe by tumiz^ the distal port open. Standard size epidural catheter can also be passed in the same sitting through the epidural needle.<br>
Epidiural needle introducing device of the present invention as evident in figure 1 above, for the sake of simplicity and greater clarity, components, performing the same functions are given the same reference niunerical and are as under:<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1	An epidural needle introducing device comprising introducer back support (9), fitted with a hollow connulated grooved screw (12) having fine spirally grooved on its outer periphery, a fine needle advancer (10) with corresponding grooves rotatably sliding over said screw, a graded guider (11) permanently fixed to the said back support, a needle hub support (14) with a needle hub fixator screw (13) being adjusted into the said graded guider and a three way stop cock (15).<br>
2	An epidural needle introducing device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said introducer back support (9) is made of tefion and whose all parts can be separated for easy cleaning.<br>
3	An epidural needle introducio^ device as claimed in previous claims wherein said graded guider (11) is made of stainless steel and is capable of guiding the anaesthetist, the distance through which the epidural needle is advanced and proving to said needle hub support (14).<br><br>
4	An epidural needle introducing device as claimed in previous claim<br>
wherein beside the said hub support, all parts are made of stainless steel<br>
thus making the device as rust proof and durable.<br>
5	An epidural needle introducing device as claimed in previous claim<br>
wherein fine needle advancer (10) provides fine, smooth and gradual<br>
advance of epidural needle (17).<br>
