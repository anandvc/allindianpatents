				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The wiper blades with a supporting-bracket frame (DE-C 15 05 397) which have been widely used for a long time in practice in wiper devices for windscreens of motor vehicles have a large overall height which accommodates the attempts of the wiper blade to lift in the air flow conditions present in front of the vehicle window/lens glass, in particular at a relatively high driving speed. This at least so greatly reduces the prescribed bearing pressure of the wiper blade against the window/lens glass that the wiping quality suffers.<br>
The invention proceeds from a wiper blade of very low construction in accordance with the generic type of Claim 1. In a known wiper blade of this type (DE 19 72 98 65.6 Al) a hinge pin which is not round in cross section is arranged on each of the two longitudinal sides of the coupling parts, the two hinge pins having a common hinge axis. The hinge half formed in such a manner on the wiper-blade side interacts with bearing holes which are present on the wiper arm, form the hinge half on the wiper-arm side and are in each case open at the edge via an inlet channel, the channel width being matched to the smaller pin diameter. The hinge is formed here in such a manner that it is not possible for the hinge pins to come out of their bearing holes during the wiping operation. If the wiper blade is to be removed from the wiper arm, for example if a worn wiper blade is to be replaced by a new wiper blade, the wiper arm has first of all to be swung away<br><br>
from the window/lens glass so that the wiper blade can be brought into its fitting position in which the hinge pins can be taken through the inlet channels and the wiper blade can be detached from the arm. When not handled properly, however, it is possible, even as the arm is being swung away, for the wiper blade to become twisted by itself in the hinge in such a manner that the blade may become unintentionally detached from the wiper arm, may fall onto the vehicle body and cause damage to this.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
In the case of the wiper blade according to the invention having the characterizing features of Claim 1 it is possible to equip the wiper arm with a pin which is round in cross section and which can be introduced into the bearing recess in the direction of the hinge axis. This produces a coupling and hinge device in which the hinge bolt of the wiper arm is completely surrounded by the bearing recess of the wiper blade. The wiper blade is detached from the wiper arm by pulling off the wiper blade from the bearing bolt of the wiper arm in the direction of the hinge axis, in which case, if appropriate, corresponding securing means have to be released beforehand. The design according to the invention of the hinge half on the wiper-blade side and of the coupling means can be used particularly advantageously in wiper devices in which the wiper arm and the wiper blade is [sic] arranged one behind the other, as seen in the wiping direction. The design of the wiper blade in the region of the coupling part is particularly cost-effective, which is of importance for structuring the cost of replacement wiper blades. In addition to its functions as a coupling means and as a hinge half, the bearing recess also acts as an excellent positioning aid when the wiper blade passes through fitting or testing devices<br><br>
during its manufacture. For a quiet wiping operation it is of substantial importance for the wiper-arm coupling part to have two side-wall regions which extend in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade, are arranged perpendicular with respect to the window/lens glass and one side-wall region of which in each case is formed on one of the two coupling-part longitudinal sides, the distance between the two side-wall regions furthermore being between 16 mm and 25 mm. Definitive guiding or locating surfaces are produced against which mating surfaces of the wiper arm can be placed neatly during the wiping operation, so that a good wiping result is ensured. By means of the range of distances of from 16 mm to 25 mm, as measured in the wiping direction, at the maximum size a minimization of a tilting movement of the wiper blade about its longitudinal axis is achieved when the wiper blade reverses its wiping direction, which, when there is a large amount of play, may also be associated with a certain, undesirable formation of noise. On the other hand, for styling reasons the width of the wiper blade, as measured in the wiping direction, must not exceed a certain size.<br>
It has turned out in practice that these problems can be solved particularly well if the distance between the two side-wall regions, as measured in the wiping direction, is between 20 mm and 23 mm.<br>
For one specific case of connection, a distance, as measured in the wiping direction, between the two side-wall regions of 22 mm has proven exceptionally favourable.<br>
In particular for visual reasons it is especially advantageous if the ratio of the length of the wiper blade to the distance between the two side-wall regions is from 1:22 to 1:33.<br>
In a continuation of the inventive concept, the bearing recess is arranged close to one end of the coupling part, as seen in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade, the thickness of the coupling part<br><br>
between the one end region, which is provided with the bearing recess, and the other end of the coupling part being smaller, at least over one longitudinal section, than that end section of the coupling part which has the bearing recess. That thicker end of the coupling part which has the bearing recess ensures the necessary stability in the region in which the force is transmitted from the wiper arm to the wiper blade.<br>
So that the wiper blade is secured, even in a position in which it is swung away from the window/lens glass, against becoming unintentionally detached from the wiper arm, the distance, as measured in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade, of the transverse hole over the transverse groove and as far as the one end of the wiper blade is greater than to the other end of the wiper blade.<br>
If [sic] the coupling-part longitudinal section having the smaller thickness of the coupling part is formed by a transverse groove in the coupling part, which groove is open to that side of the coupling part which faces away from the supporting element. This longitudinal section can be used as a transfer channel for securing means of the wiper arm, the said securing means, with the wiper blade arranged next to the wiper arm in the wiping direction, being effective on that side of the wiper blade which faces away from the wiper arm, without the low overall height of the wiper blade thereby being unfavourably affected.<br>
It has proven particularly advantageous if one of the two side-wall regions surrounds the mouth of the bearing recess and the other side-wall region is arranged on that section of the coupling part which has a smaller thickness than that end region of the coupling part which is provided with the bearing recess. There is therefore, as seen in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade, a distance between the two locating surfaces, which has proven particularly<br><br>
Advantageous with regard to the guiding of the wiper blade during the wiping operation.<br>
If the bearing recess is designed as a blind hole, the soiling of this higuly stressed bearing can be considerably reduced.<br>
If the securing means which have already been mentioned for the wiper blade are matched to the selected width of the groove of 8 mm to 10 mm, preferably 9 mm, there results for the wiper blade during the wiping operation a further improvement in the stability and also alleviation of the load on the bearing if the securing means are supported on the mutually facing groc v"e walls.<br>
So that a wind-deflecting surface which is to be arranged on the wiper blade is also continued in the region of the coupling part, at least one of the two coupling-part longitudinal sides in provided over one section with a bevel. Moreover, if both coupling-part longitudinal sides are provided with a bevel of this type, further simplification of the fitting of the wiper blade to the wiper arm can be achieved.<br>
Advantages with regard to the production costs for the wiper blade arise if the coupling part is produced from a plastic.<br>
It may be of advantage here [lacuna] the bearing recess in the coupling part [lacuna] by the hole in a guide bushing seated in the coupling part, a favourable sliding-partner combination together with the material for the hin^e bolt can be obtained.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a wiper blade for cleaning motor vehicle windows and glass, having an elongated, rubber-elastic wiper strip that can be pressed against the window and glass and that is disposed, parallel to a longitudinal axis, on one band face of a band-shaped-elongated, spring-elastic support element, and a coupling part cormected to a center portion of the support element is seated on another band face of the support element and has one hinge half, whose hinge axis is oriented transversely to a length of the wiper blade, wherein both this hinge half and coupling means of the wiper blade are formed by a bearing recess in the coupling part, and the coupling part is considerably shallower over a longitudinal portion than a longitudinal region of the bearing recess, and wherein the longitudinal portion is formed by a width of a transverse groove.<br>
Further advantageous developments and refinements of the invention are specified in the following description of an exemplary embodiment which is illustrated in the associated drawing.<br>
Drawing<br>
In the drawing: Figure 1 shows a side view of a wiper blade according to the<br>
invention, Figure 2 shows	<br><br>
a plan view of the wiper blade according to Figure 1 with the wiper arm indicated by dash-dotted lines. Figure 3 shows an isometric, enlarged illustration of a detail denoted in Figure 1 by III, Figure 4 shows a coupling part which is shown in Figure 3, in plan view and partially sectioned. Figure 5 shows a section through the coupling part along the line V-V in Figure 4, Figure 6 shows a section through the coupling part along the line VI-VI in Figure 4, and Figure 7 shows another version of the design of the coupling part which is illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
The wiper blade 10 shown in Figure 1 has a resilient supporting element 12 which is elongated in a band-like manner (Figure 3) with an elongated, elastomeric wiper strip 16 fastened to its lower side 14 parallel to its longitudinal axis. On the upper side 18, which faces away from the windscreen 24, of the supporting element 12, which can also be described as a spring rail, there is arranged, in the central section of the said supporting element, that coupling part 20 of a connecting device which is on the wiper-blade side, with the aid of which device the wiper blade 10 can be hinged to a driven wiper arm in a manner enabling it to be detached. For this purpose, the wiper arm is provided at its free end with a part of the connecting device on the wiper-arm side. The wiper arm, and therefore also the wiper blade 10, is loaded in the direction of the arrow 22 towards the motor-vehicle window/lens glass 24 which is to be wiped (indicated by dash-dotted lines in Figure 1) and whose surface which is to be wiped has been provided with the reference number 26 in Figure 1. Since the line 26 is intended to depict the greatest curvature of the window/lens glass surface, it is clearly apparent that the curvature of the wiper blade 10 which is not yet loaded and bears by<br><br>
its two ends against the window/lens glass 24 is greater than the maximum curvature of the window/lens glass (Figure 1). Under the contact pressure (arrow 22) the wiper blade 10 is placed over its entire length by its wiper lip 28 against the window/lens glass surface 26. In the process, tension builds in the resilient supporting element 12, which is manufactured from metal, the tension ensuring a correct positioning of the wiper strip 16 and of the wiper lip 28 over its entire length against the window/lens glass and also ensuring a uniform distribution of the contact pressure. A wiper blade designed in such a way is of considerably lower construction than a wiper blade with a supporting-bracket frame which has already been described at the beginning. The advantages of a wiper blade which is provided with a spring rail 12 in place of a supporting frame can be seen, in particular, in its insensitivity to the attempts to lift, which are unavoidable in the case of wiper blades which have a supporting-bracket frame and are of higher construction. Since the generally spherically curved window/lens glass does not constitute a section of a spherical surface, the wiper blade 10 has to be able to be adapted with respect to the wiper arm 30 during its wiping movement continuously to the particular position of the window/lens glass surface. The connecting device is therefore designed at the same time as a hinge connection between the wiper blade 10 and wiper arm 30 (illustrated by dashed lines in Figure 2).<br>
During the wiping operation the wiper arm 30 swivels around a swivel axis 32 (Figure 2), so that the wiper blade 10 is displaced transversely to its longitudinal extent over the window/lens glass 24 in the direction of a double arrow 34, which is shown in Figure 2.<br>
In the following, further details of the particular refinement of the wiper blade 10 will be entered into. As the drawing shows, the coupling part<br><br>
20 on the wiper-blade side sits in the central section of the supporting element 12, which is elongated in a band-like manner, specifically sits on the upper band surface 18 thereof which faces away from the window/lens glass. The wiper strip 16 is arranged on the other, lower band surface 14. In spite of the fact that in the exemplary embodiment the supporting element 12 is illustrated as a single-piece spring band, it may, if required, also be constructed from a plurality of individual or sub-elements. The coupling part 20, which is connected fixedly to the supporting element 12, is provided close to its one end region with a transverse hole 36 which, in the embodiment according to Figure 4, is illustrated as a blind hole and forms the hinge half on the wiper-blade side of a hinge which permits a relative movement between the wiper arm and wiper blade in a plane which is perpendicular to the window/lens glass 24. The transverse hole 36 therefore constitutes a bearing recess, for example for a hinge bolt 38 which is arranged laterally on the wiper arm 30 and is depicted by dash-dotted lines (Figure 4). In addition to its function as a bearing recess for the hinge bolt, the transverse hole 36 also forms the coupling means which is on the wiper-blade side and via which the wiper blade 10 can be connected in an operationally reliable manner to the wiper arm 30.<br>
The coupling part 20 is provided with two side-wall regions 40 and 42 which extend in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade 10, are arranged perpendicular with respect to the window/lens glass and one side-wall region of which in each case is formed on one of the two coupling-part longitudinal sides 44. The distance 4 6, as measured in the wiping direction (double arrow 34), between the two side-wall regions 40 and 42 is of particular importance here, and will be discussed further later on. One purpose of the side-wall regions 40 and 42 can be seen in the fact that the wiper blade can be supported in one wiping direction by<br><br>
its side-wall region 40 against a supporting surface of the wiper arm 30, while the other side-wall region 42 takes over this function during the countermovement of the wiper blade. In order to ensure the smallest possible tilting movement of the wiper blade about its longitudinal axis at the moment of reversal of the wiping direction, a distance 46 which is as large as possible has to be aimed for. On the other hand, too great a distance 46 interferes with the visual appearance of the wiper blade and with the harmony in the front view of the motor vehicle equipped with a wiper blade of this type. In weighing up these two criteria it has proven advantageous if the distance 46 between the two side-wall regions is between 16 and 25 mm. Furthermore, it has turned out that the ratio of the length of the wiper blade to the distance 4 6 between the two side-wall regions should as far as possible be in the range of from 1:22 to 1:33, likewise for visual reasons. The result, therefore, for a wide spectrum of the available wiper blades is a distance 46 between the two side-wall regions 40 and 42 which is between 20 and 23 mm. For a special and specific application a distance 46 of 22 mm has proven exceptionally advantageous.<br>
As Figures 3 and 4 show, the blind transverse hole 36, which can be described as a bearing recess, in the coupling part 20 is arranged close to the one end of the coupling part. In this region (Figure 6) the thickness 48 of the coupling part, as measured from the upper side 18 of the coupling part 20, is greater than in another region of the coupling part. It is apparent, in particular from Figure 3, that the coupling part 20 is considerably lower over a length section 50 than in the region of the bearing recess 36. This longitudinal section 50 is formed by the width of a transverse groove 54 which is open to that side of the coupling part which faces away from the supporting element 12.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment it is of particular<br><br><br><br><br>
importance that the one 4 0 of the two side-wall regions 40, 42 is designed as a bearing lug which projects in the direction of the hinge axis 52 and surrounds the mouth of the transverse hole 36. The other side-wall region 42 is situated in that region of the coupling-part longitudinal side 44 at which the transverse groove 54 opens or ends. It is therefore also situated at the location where the coupling part 20 has a smaller thickness than at the end region of the coupling part 20 which is provided with the bearing recess 36. In the exemplary embodiment, the width 50, as measured in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade, of the transverse groove 54 is 9 mm. This results in a sufficiently wide clearance for the transfer of a securing hook 56 which is connected to the wiper arm 30, belongs to the latter and with one leg 58, which is bent towards the window/lens glass, engages over the coupling part 20 and therefore the wiper blade 10 in the region of the transverse groove 54, and with its leg 58 interacts with the side-wall region 42 when the wiper blade executes its working movements. A width of 9 mm for the transverse groove 54 makes possible an appropriately stable design of the securing hook 56 which crosses over the wiper blade in the transverse groove 54 without the overall height of the wiper blade 10 being unfavourably affected thereby. The coupling part 20 according to Figures 3 to 6 is produced from a plastic, the transverse hole 36 being formed directly in the block-like coupling part and the bearing lug being moulded onto the coupling part.<br>
In order to optimize the sliding properties between the hinge bolt 38 on the wiper-arm side and that wall of the transverse hole 36 which acts as a sliding partner, it can be of advantage if the transverse hole 36 is formed by the central hole 60 in a guide or sliding bushing 62 which is seated in the coupling part 120. The guide bushing 62 may for the same reason be provided with an annular collar 64 which<br><br>
protrudes out of the coupling-part longitudinal side 144 which faces the wiper arm 30 and in place of the bearing lug therefore forms a side-wall region 140 which corresponds to the side-wall region 40 of the embodiment already described. Of course, this also applies if a separate annular disc is arranged in place of the annular collar. An embodiment of this type is illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
By virtue of the fact that the bearing or transverse hole 36 is arranged at a certain distance 59 from the transverse groove 54 (Figure 4), a corresponding distance between the two side-wall regions 40 and 42 or 140 and 42 naturally also arises, as a result of which a further improvement in the guiding of the wiper blade is obtained.<br>
It can be seen from Figure 2 that the distance 82, as measured in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade 10, of the transverse or bearing hole 36 or of the hinge axis 52 over the transverse groove 54 and as far as the one end of the wiper blade 10 is greater than the distance 84 from the hinge axis 52 to the other end of the wiper blade. The centre of gravity which is defined in such a manner and is displaced towards the one end of the wiper blade causes a torque to arise when the wiper blade 10 has been swung away from the window/lens glass 24, the said torque rotating the wiper blade about the hinge axis 52 in the direction of the arrow  with the result that the said wiper blade always remains with its side-wall regions 40, 42 of the coupling part 20 between the securing means 30, 56 of the wiper arm 30 and is thereby secured against becoming unintentionally detached from the wiper arm.<br>
The forcibly predetermined operating position of the wiper blade 10 between the securing means of the wiper arm means that erroneous fitting is reliably avoided, since otherwise the operating position which<br><br>
can clearly be seen visually between the wiper arm and wiper blade cannot be reached.<br>
In certain applications the wiper blade 10 can be provided with a so-called wind-deflecting strip, which is known per se, on the upper side 18 of the supporting element 12. In such applications it may be of advantage if at least one of the two coupling-part longitudinal sides 44 or 144 is provided over one section with a bevel 66 which takes over the function of the wir.d-deflecting strip in this subregion of the wiper blade. Moreover, if both coupling-part longitudinal sides are provided with a bevel 66 of this type, fitting, if the wiper blade 10 is to be connected to the wiper arm, can be further facilitated.<br>
