Interlocking Brake System for Small Type Vehicle [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a brake system used in a small type vehicle such as a motorcycle, and particularly to an interlocking brake system for a small type vehicle, including an interlocking device which includes an independent brake operation cable and an interlocking brake operation cable and which ensures that either one of a front brake and a rear wheel brake operates singly when the independent brake operation cable is operated and that both the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake operate in an interlocked manner when the interlocking brake operation cable is operated. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
In small type vehicles such as motorcycles, in some cases, for example, only a front wheel brake operates when a front wheel brake lever on the right grip side provided on a steering handle is operated, and on the other hand, not only a rear wheel brake but also the front wheel brake operate in an interlocked manner when a<br>
rear wheel brake lever on the left grip side is operated. In such cases, the brake system for the vehicle is provided with an interlocking device for causing the front wheel brake to operate singly or causing both the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake to operate in an interlocked manner, according to the operation on each of the brake levers. [0003]<br>
As such an interlocking device conventionally known, there is one as described in Patent Document 1.  The interlocking device has a structure in which an interlocking link is swingably attached to a brake lever in an interlocking brake operation system, and a front wheel brake operation cable and a rear wheel brake operation cable are respectively connected to the interlocking link at positions spaced from the swinging center of the interlocking link. [0004]<br>
In use of the interlocking brake system including such an interlocking device, when the brake lever in the interlocking brake operation system is operated, the interlocking link is turned together with the brake lever, and the front wheel brake operation cable and the rear wheel brake operation cable which are connected to the<br>
interlocking link are pulled.  Therefore, both the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake operate.  In this case, the operating force on the brake lever is transmitted respectively to the front wheel brake operation cable and the rear wheel brake operation cable at a distribution ratio according to the distances from the swinging center of the interlocking link to the connection portions of the individual cables.  Therefore, the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake generate braking forces according to the distribution ratio. [Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-16862<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0005]<br>
However, in the system in which the interlocking link is moved by an operation on the brake lever as described in Patent Document 1, the operation range of the interlocking link is comparatively wide due to the operating conditions of the individual cables, so that it is difficult to reduce the overall size of the system, due to the need to prevent interferences in the wide range.  In addition, since it is necessary to provide the interlocking link in the periphery of the brake lever and<br>
to connect the front and rear wheel brake operation cables to the interlocking link, the degree of freedom in layout is limited. [0006]<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-mentioned circumstances. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an interlocking brake system for small type vehicle which is simple in structure, has a high degree of freedom in layout, and can be configured in a compact form.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems] [0007]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the present invention is firstly characterized in that, in an interlocking brake system for a small type vehicle, including an interlocking device which includes an independent brake operation cable and an interlocking brake operation cable and which ensures that either one of a front wheel brake and a rear wheel brake operates singly when the independent brake operation cable is operated and that both of the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake operate in an interlocked manner when the interlocking brake operation cable is operated, the<br>
interlocking device includes a cable holding member, and a holder slidable in the axial direction of the independent brake operation cable and the interlocking brake operation cable; outer cables of the independent brake operation cable and the interlocking brake operation cable are divided into an input side and an output side at the position where the interlocking device is laid out; an outer cable on the input side or the output side of the independent brake operation cable is attached to the holder, while the other outer cable is fixed to the cable holding member; and of outer cables on the input side or the output side of the interlocking brake operation cable, the outer cable on the opposite side of the independent brake operation cable is attached to the holder, and the other outer cable is fixed to the cable holding member. [0008]<br>
In addition, the present invention is secondly-characterized, in addition to the first characteristic, in that a delay spring for biasing the holder toward a non-operative position is provided between the holder and the cable holding member. [0009]<br>
Further, the present invention is thirdly<br>
characterized, in addition to the first or second characteristic, in that the cable holding member is included of a hollow cylindrical case for surrounding the independent brake operation cable and the interlocking brake operation cable, and covers for closing both end faces of the case, and the holder is slid inside the case, [0010]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is fourthly characterized, in addition to the first or second characteristic, in that the cable holding member is included of a rod substantially parallel to the independent brake operation cable and the interlocking brake operation cable, and a pair of plates fixedly supported on both end portions of the rod, and the holder is slidably supported on the rod. [0011]<br>
Besides, the present invention is fifthly characterized in that, in an interlocking brake system for a small type vehicle, including a front wheel brake, a rear wheel brake, either one of the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake being a hydraulic type brake operated by a liquid pressure generated by a master cylinder and the other one being a mechanical type brake operated by turning an operation lever by a traction of<br>
an operation cable, and an interlocking device which includes an independent brake operation cable and an interlocking brake operation cable and which ensures that a piston in the master cylinder is pushed and the resulting liquid pressure causes the hydraulic type brake to operate singly when the independent brake operation cable is operated and that the operation lever of the mechanical type brake is turned and the piston in the master cylinder is pushed so as to cause both the hydraulic type brake and the mechanical type brake to operate in an interlocked manner when the interlocking brake operation cable is operated, the interlocking device includes a cable holding member disposed to be incapable of being displaced relative to the master cylinder, a holder slid in the axial direction of the interlocking brake operation cable to push the piston in the master cylinder, and a knocker arm driven by an operation of the independent brake operation cable to abut on the piston in the master cylinder and to push the piston; an outer cable of the interlocking brake operation cable is divided into an input side and an output side at the position where the interlocking device is laid out; and the outer cable on the input side or the output side of the interlocking brake operation cable is<br>
attached to the holder, and the other outer cable is fixed to the cable holding member. [0012]<br>
Besides, the present invention is sixthly-characterized, in addition to the fifth characteristic, in that the holder, at the time of sliding thereof, abuts on the knocker arm to thereby push the piston in the master cylinder. [Effects of the Invention] [0013]<br>
According to the first characteristic above, when the interlocking brake operation cable is operated to pull the inner cable thereof, the rear wheel brake or the front wheel brake which is in connection with the inner cable is first caused to operate.  Simultaneously, a reaction force against the traction exerted on the inner cable is generated on the outer cable of the interlocking brake operation cable, and the holder to which the outer cable is attached is displaced in the axial direction of the cable, so that a pushing force is exerted on the outer cable of the independent brake operation cable attached to the holder, and the inner cable of the independent brake operation cable is pulled. As a result, the front wheel brake or the rear wheel brake to which<br>
the inner cable of the independent brake operation cable is connected is caused to operate.  In this way, the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake can be made to operate in an interlocked manner.  In this case, the interlocking device can be laid out at an arbitrary position insofar as the position ensures that the independent brake operation cable and the interlocking brake operation cable are laid out roughly in parallel to each other, and therefore, the structure in the periphery of the brake lever can be simplified.  Besides, since the moving direction of the holder is in the axial direction of each of the cables, prevention of interferences thereof can be easily achieved. Moreover, the interlocking device is extremely simple in structure. Therefore, the interlocking device as a whole can be configured in a compact form. [0014]<br>
In addition, according to the second characteristic above, at the time of operation of the interlocking brake operation cable, until the reaction force generated on the outer cable thereof exceeds the biasing force of the delay spring, the holder is not moved and only the brake on one side operates, and when the reaction force has exceeded the biasing force of the delay spring, the<br>
holder is moved to a position where the two forces balance each other, with the result that both the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake operate.  Therefore, by regulating the spring load of the delay spring, it is possible to adjust the operation timings of the front and rear wheel brakes and the distribution ratio of braking forces. [0015]<br>
According to the third characteristic above, the holder which is a movable part of the interlocking device is contained in the case, so that the interferences between the holder and vehicle body portions can be securely prevented from occurring.  In addition, the work of mounting the interlocking device onto the vehicle body can be facilitated. [0016]<br>
On the other hand, according to the fourth characteristic above, the case used in the third characteristic is omitted, so that the outside diameter size of the interlocking device can be further reduced, and the interlocking device as a whole can be configured in an extremely compact form. [0017]<br>
Besides, according to the fifth characteristic<br>
above, when the interlocking brake operation cable is operated to pull the inner cable thereof, the traction on the inner cable causes the mechanical type brake to operate, first.  Simultaneously, the reaction'force against the traction exerted on the inner cable is generated on the outer cable of the interlocking brake operation cable, and the holder to which the outer cable is attached is displaced, so that the piston in the master cylinder is pushed by the holder.  Therefore, the hydraulic type brake is made to operate.  In this manner, the hydraulic type brake and the mechanical type brake can be made to operate in an interlocked manner. [0018]<br>
Further, according to the sixth characteristic above, both when the independent brake operation cable is operated and when the interlocking brake operation cable is operated, the piston in the master cylinder is pushed by the knocker arm which functions in common for both cases, and therefore, the number of component parts can be reduced.  Besides, since the holder and the knocker arm are designed to simply abut on each other, the knocker arm parts from the holder when the independent brake operation cable is operated.  Therefore, it is possible, for example, to cause the front wheel brake to operate<br>
solely.<br>

[0021]<br>
First, a first embodiment of the present invention shown in Figs. 1 to 5 will be described. [0022]<br>
In Fig. 1, on a steering handle 2 provided at an upper end portion of a vehicle body 1 of a motorcycle, an independent brake lever 3 is rotatably supported adjacently to a right grip 2a, and an interlocking brake lever 4 is rotatably supported adjacently to a left grip 2b. An inner cable 5a of an independent brake operation cable 5 is connected to the independent brake lever 3, and the inner cable 5a is pulled by operating the independent brake lever 3.  In addition, an inner cable 6a of an interlocking brake operation cable 6 is connected to the interlocking brake lever 4, and the inner cable 6a is pulled by operating the interlocking brake lever 4.<br>
[0023]<br>
On the other hand, both a front wheel brake Bf and a rear wheel brake Br provided respectively at front and rear wheels of the motorcycle are mechanical type drum brakes which are each made to operate by turning an operation lever, and the inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5 is connected to the operation lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf, while the inner cable 6a of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 is connected to the operation lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br.  Thus, the front wheel brake Bf is made to operate by pulling the inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5, whereas the rear wheel brake Br is made to operate by pulling the inner cable 6a of the interlocking brake operation cable 6.  The operation levers 7f, 7r of the brakes Bf, Br are biased in non-operative directions by return springs 8f, 8r, respectively. [0024]<br>
The independent brake operation cable 5 and the interlocking brake operation cable 6 are laid out to be substantially parallel to each other, at a position in the vicinity of a side surface of a head pipe Ih of the vehicle body 1 of the motorcycle. At the position, there<br>
is provided an interlocking device 9 for causing the front and/or rear wheel brake Bf, Br to operate either singly or in an interlocked manner. Outer cables 5b, 6b of the independent brake operation cable 5 and the interlocking brake operation cable 6 are divided respectively into an input-side outer cable 5bl, 6bl and an output-side outer cable 5b2, 6b2, at the position where the interlocking device 9 is laid out.  Of each of the input-side outer cables 5bl, 6bl, one end is supported on the steering handle 2, whereas the other end is supported by the interlocking device 9 as will be described later.  Besides, of each of the output-side outer cables 5b2, 6b2, one end is supported by a fixed panel of the front or rear wheel brake Bf, Br, and the other end is supported by the interlocking device 9 as will be described later. [0025]<br>
As is clear from Figs. 2 and 3, the interlocking device 9 includes a cable holding member 13 which is composed of a hollow cylindrical case 10 for surrounding the independent brake operation cable 5 and the interlocking brake operation cable 6, and a pair of covers 11, 12 for closing both end faces of the case 10. Each of the covers 11, 12 is fixed while being positioned<br>
by a hollow cylindrical body 14, fitted in the inner circumferential surface of the case 10, and a pair of rings 15, 15.  The cable holding member 13 is fixed to and supported on the vehicle body 1 by bolts 16, 16. Incidentally, the cable holding member 13 can also be supported on the vehicle body 1 in a floating state. [0026]<br>
A holder 18 having insertion holes 17, 17 for slidably passing therethrough the inner cables 5a, 6a of the independent brake operation cable 5 and the interlocking brake operation cable 6 is provided inside the case 10.  The holder 18 is supported while being slidably fitted in the inner circumference of the above-mentioned hollow cylindrical body 14.  Therefore, the holder 18 is slidable in the axial direction of the cables 5, 6, between the covers 11, 12 provided at both ends of the case 10. [0027]<br>
The input-side outer cable 5bl of the independent brake operation cable 5 is attached to a surface on the input side (the right side in Fig. 2) of the holder 18. In addition, the output-side outer cable 5b2 of the independent brake operation cable 5 is fixed to the cover 12 on the output side (the left side in Fig. 2).  On the<br>
other hand, of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, the input-side outer cable 6bl is fixed to the cover 11 on the input side, and the output-side outer cable 6b2 is attached to a surface on the output side of the holder 18. Thus, the input-side outer cable 5bl of the independent brake operation cable 5 and the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 are attached respectively to surfaces on the opposite sides of the holder 18; the outer cables on the other side, i.e., the output-side outer cable 5b2 of the independent brake operation cable 5 and the input-side outer cable 6bl of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 are fixed to the cable holding member 13 so as to be opposed to each other.  Further, spring holders 19, 20 are attached to the cover 11 on the input side and the holder 18 so as to be opposed to each other, and a delay spring 21 for biasing the spring holders 19, 2 0 in repelling directions are provided between the spring holders 19, 20.  Therefore, the holder 18 is biased (pushed) toward the position for abutting on the cover 12 on the output side, i.e., toward a non-operative position. [0028]<br>
Next, the functions of the first embodiment will be described.<br>
[0029]<br>
When both the independent brake operation cable 5 and the interlocking brake operation cable 6 are in non-operative conditions, i.e., when an operating force is exerted on neither the independent brake lever 3 nor the interlocking brake lever 4, the inner cables 5a, 6a of the independent brake operation cable 5 and the interlocking brake operation cable 6 are biased toward the left side in Fig. 2 by return springs 8f, 8r provided in the front and rear wheel brakes Bf, Br, respectively. In addition, the biasing force of the delay spring 21 keeps the holder 18 in the state of abutting on the cover 12 on the output side.<br>
[0030]<br>
When the independent brake lever 3 is operated to pull the inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5 under this condition, the traction<br>
(pulling force) is directly transmitted to the operation lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf, so that the front wheel brake Bf operates.  In this instance, respective reaction forces are generated on the outer cables 5bl, 5b2 of the independent brake operation cable 5, but, since the output-side outer cable 5b2 is fixed to the cover 12 on the output side which constitutes a part of<br>
the cable holding member 13 fixedly supported on the vehicle body 1, the reaction force thereon does not produce any change.  In addition, since the reaction force generated on the input-side outer cable 5bl serves as a force for pushing the holder 18 toward the cover 12 on the output side, the reaction force does not produce any change.  Therefore, no traction (pulling force) is exerted on the inner cable 6 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, so that the rear wheel brake Br does not operate, [0031]<br>
Thus, when the independent brake lever 3 is operated, the rear wheel brake Br does not operates, and only the front wheel brake Bf operates singly.  Then, when the operating force on the independent brake lever 3 is eliminated, the operation lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf is returned to its initial position by the biasing force of the return spring 8f, so that the front wheel brake Bf is put into a non-operative condition. [0032]<br>
In addition, when the interlocking brake lever 4 is operated to pull the inner cable 6a of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, the traction (pulling force) is directly transmitted to the operation lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br, so that the rear wheel brake Br<br><br>
operates first.  In this instance, due to the reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, a force for moving the holder 18, to which the outer cable 6b2 is attached, toward the cover 11 on the input side is exerted on the holder 18. However, while this force is smaller than a movement restricting force exerted on the holder 18 by the delay spring 21, the holder 18 is kept in abutment on the cover 12 on the output side. [0033]<br>
When the interlocking brake lever 4 is continuedly operated and the reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 is further increased under this condition, the force for moving the holder 18 toward the cover 11 on the input side comes to exceed the movement restricting force exerted by the delay spring 21.  Then, the holder 18 moves toward the cover 11 on the input side, and the input-side outer cable 5bl of the independent brake operation cable 5 attached to the holder 18 is pushed in the rightward direction in Fig. 2. As a result, the inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5 is pulled together with the inner cable 6a of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, so that the front wheel brake Bf<br>
also operates.  In this instance, the holder 18 is moved to the position where the combined force with the reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 balances the load generated on the delay spring 21.  Therefore, the braking forces of the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br are in a distribution ratio according to the spring force of the delay spring 21. [0034]<br>
Then, when the operating force on the interlocking brake lever 4 reaches a predetermined magnitude, the holder 18 abuts on the cover 11 on the input side as shown in Fig. 4, so that the holder 18 is inhibited from moving further.  Therefore, the braking force of the front wheel brake Bf is not increased further, and only the braking force of the rear wheel brake Br is increased thereafter. [0035]<br>
Thus, when the interlocking brake lever 4 is operated, the rear wheel brake Br operates first, and the front wheel brake Bf operates next in an interlocked manner, with a little time lag. As a result, the front and rear wheels are braked substantially simultaneously while pitching of the vehicle is being prevented, and the<br>
motorcycle is braked in a stable manner. When the operating force on the interlocking brake lever 4 is removed, the operation levers 7f, 7r of the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br are returned to their initial positions by the biasing forces of the return springs 8f, 8r, so that both the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake B£ are put into non-operative conditions.  Then, the interlocking device 9 is also returned to the condition shown in Fig. 2. [0036]<br>
As mentioned above, according to this embodiment, the interlocking device 9 is configured by only providing the holder 18 slidable in the axial direction of the cables 5, 6 and appropriately attaching the outer cables 5b, 6b of the cables 5, 6 to the holder 18 and to the cable holding member 13 fixedly supported on the vehicle body 1, so that the interlocking device 9 can be made compact and the degree of freedom in laying out the interlocking device 9 can be enhanced.  Besides, since the cable holding member 13 is composed of the hollow cylindrical case 10 and the covers 11, 12 for closing both ends of the case 10 and the holder 18 is contained in the case 10, the movable portions can be prevented from being exposed to the exterior.<br>
[0037]<br>
Now, a second embodiment of the present invention shown in Figs. 5 to 7 will be described below. [0038]<br>
The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment only in the cable holding member constituting the interlocking device 9, and the other configurations are the same as in the previous embodiment; therefore, the portions corresponding to those in the previous embodiment are denoted by the same symbols as used above, and description thereof will be omitted. [0039]<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, in the case of the second embodiment, the interlocking device 9 includes a cable holding member 26 which includes a rod 23 disposed in parallel to an independent brake operation cable 5 and an interlocking brake operation cable 6, and a pair of plates 24, 25 fixedly supported on both end portions of the rod 23.  The plates 24, 25 are fixed while being positioned by stepped portions 23a, 23a formed at both end portions of the rod 23, and nuts 27, 27 fastened to screw portions 23b, 23b at both ends of the rod 23. The cable holding member 26 is fixedly supported on a vehicle body 1 through a bracket 2 8 which is co-fastened to the<br>
plate 24 on one side.  Incidentally, the cable holding member 2 6 can also be supported on the vehicle body 1 in a floating state. [0040]<br>
A holder 29 is provided between the plate 24 on the input side (the right side in Fig. 5) and the plate 25 on the output side (the left side in Fig. 5) .  The holder 2 9 is slidably supported on the rod 23 through a slide bush 30 fitted over the rod 23.  Therefore, the holder 29 is slidable in the axial direction of the cables 5, 6, between the plates 24, 25 located at both ends. [0041]<br>
In the same manner as in the first embodiment, an input-side outer cable 5bl of the independent brake operation cable 5 is attached to a surface on the input side of the holder 29, and an output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking operation cable 6 is attached to a surface on the output side of the holder 29.  In addition, an output-side outer cable 5b2 of the independent brake operation cable 5 is fixed to the plate 25 on the output side, and an input-side outer cable 6bl of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 is fixed to the plate 24 on the input side. A slide bush 31 for slidably supporting the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the<br>
interlocking brake operation cable 6 is provided at the plate 25 on the output side. The outer cable 6b2 is provided with a stopper 32 to be brought into abutment on the plate 25 on the output side. [0042]<br>
Further, a delay spring 33 for biasing the plate 24 on the input side and the holder 29 in repelling directions is provided between the plate 24 and the holder 29. Therefore, the holder 29 is biased (pushed) toward the position for abutting on the plate 25 on the output side, i.e., toward a non-operative position. [0043]<br>
Also in an interlocking brake system including such an interlocking device 9, when an interlocking brake lever 4 (see Fig. 1) is operated to pull an inner cable 6a of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, a rear wheel brake Br operates, and due to a reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, a force for moving the holder 2 9 toward the plate 24 on the input side is exerted on the holder 29. Then, when the reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 comes to exceed a load set for the delay spring 33, the holder 29 is moved<br>
toward the plate 24 on the input side, and the input-side outer cable 5bl of the independent brake operation cable 5 attached to the holder 29 is pushed in the rightward direction in Fig. 5. Therefore, an inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5 is pulled, and a front wheel brake Bf operates.<br>
[0044]<br>
Then, when the operating force on the interlocking brake lever 4 reaches a predetermined magnitude, the stopper 32 provided on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 abuts on the plate 25 on the output side, as shown in Fig. 7, whereby the holder 2 9 is inhibited from moving further.  Therefore, the braking force of the front wheel brake Bf is not increased further, and only the braking force of the rear wheel brake Br is increased thereafter.<br>
[0045]<br>
Thus, according to this second embodiment, also, the same functions or effects as in the case of the first embodiment can be obtained. Besides, the second embodiment is particularly effective in the case where it is desired to reduce the outside diameter size of the interlocking device 9.<br>
[0046]<br>
Now, a third embodiment of the present invention shown in Figs. 8 to 14 will be described below. [0047]<br>
This third embodiment is an embodiment in which a hydraulic type brake is used as one of front and rear wheel brakes Bf, Br.  The basic configuration of the third embodiment is the same as that of the first embodiment, so, in the figure, the portions corresponding to those in the first embodiment are denoted by the same symbols used above. [0048]<br>
In Fig. 8, on a steering handle 2 provided at an upper end portion of a vehicle body 1 of a motorcycle, an independent brake lever 3 is rotatably supported adjacently to a right grip 2a, and an interlocking brake lever 4 is rotatably supported adjacently to a left grip 2b. The independent brake lever 3 is for causing the front wheel brake Bf to operate singly when it is operated, and the interlocking brake lever 4 is for causing the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br to operate in an interlocked manner when it is operated. The front wheel brake Bf is a hydraulic type disk brake made to operate by a liquid pressure fed into a caliper body 35, whereas the rear wheel brake Br is a<br>
mechanical type drum brake made to operate by turning an operation lever 7r by a traction (pulling force) on an operation cable 6.  The operation lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br is biased in a non-operative direction by a return spring 8r. [0049]<br>
For causing the front and/or rear wheel brake Bf, Br to operate either singly or in an interlocked manner, this interlocking brake system is provided with an independent brake operation system A and an interlocking brake operation system B.  The independent brake operation system A is composed of the independent brake lever 3, an independent brake operation cable 5, a master cylinder 36, a liquid pressure piping 37, and the caliper body 35. On the other hand, the interlocking brake operation system B is composed of the interlocking brake lever 4, the interlocking brake operation cable 6, the operation lever 7r, and the master cylinder 36, the liquid pressure piping 37 and the caliper body 35 which are used in common for this system and for the independent brake operation system A. [0050]<br>
The independent brake operation system A is composed of an inner cable 5a and an outer cable 5b.  One<br>
end of the inner cable 5a is connected to the independent brake lever 3 so that the inner cable 5a is pulled when the independent brake lever 3 is operated.  One end of the outer cable 5b is supported on the steering handle 2, and the other end is supported by the master cylinder 36 as will be described later.  On the other hand, the interlocking brake operation system B is composed of an inner cable 6a and an outer cable 6b. The outer cable 6b is divided into an input-side outer cable 6bl and an output-side outer cable 6b2.  The inner cable 6a is a single cable of which one end is connected to the interlocking brake lever 4, and the other end is connected to the operation lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br, so that the inner cable 6a is pulled when the interlocking brake lever 4 is operated.  Of the input-side outer cable 6bl, one end is supported on the steering handle 2, and the other end is supported by an interlocking device 38 as will be described later; of the output-side outer cable 6b2, one end is supported on a fixed panel of the rear wheel brake Br, and the other end is supported by the interlocking device 38 as will be described later. [0051]<br>
The master cylinder 36 is attached, by a bolt 39,<br>
to a side surface, in the vicinity of a head pipe Ih located on the lower side of the steering handle 2, of the vehicle body 1 of the motorcycle. As is clear from Figs. 10 and 11, the master cylinder 36 is composed of a cylinder main body 40, and a piston 42 slidably fitted in a cylinder bore 41 which is provided in the cylinder main body 40 and extends in the vertical direction.  The upper end of the cylinder bore 41 is closed with an upper bottom wall 41a, while the other end is left open.  The piston 42 forms a liquid pressure chamber 43 between itself and the upper bottom wall 41a of the cylinder bore 41, and is biased (pushed) downwards by a return spring 44 which is disposed in a contracted state in the liquid pressure chamber 43.  Thus, a lower end portion of the piston 42 is projected from the lower-end opening of the cylinder bore 41. [0052]<br>
The upper bottom wall 41a of the cylinder bore 41 is provided with a connection port 45 communicated with the liquid pressure chamber 43, and the above-mentioned liquid pressure piping 37 is connected to the connection port 45.  In addition, a circumferential wall, at a central portion in the vertical direction, of the cylinder bore 41 is provided with a supply port 47<br>
connected to a reservoir 46 (see Fig. 8).<br>
[0053]<br>
At a lower end portion of the cylinder main body 4 0 of the master cylinder 36, a support shaft 48 is provided on the rear side (the right side in Fig. 10) of the cylinder bore 41. A knocker arm 49 and a front arm 50 are rotatably supported on the support shaft 48.  The knocker arm 49 is provided, at its portion opposed to the piston 42 of the master cylinder 36, with a knocker portion 49a for pushing the piston 42. While the knocker arm 49 is not in operation, the knocker portion 4 9a is kept in abutment on the lower end face of the piston 42.  The knocker arm 49 is provided, at its rear end portion, with a stopper portion 51 to be brought into abutment on the back surface of the cylinder main body 40.<br>
[0054]<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Figs. 9 and 12, the front arm 50 is a member roughly J-shaped in plan view, which is provided with a pair of side walls opposed to each other with a spacing therebetween by turning back a tip end side portion of a single sheet of metallic plate. An intermediate portion in the front-rear direction of the front arm 5 0 can abut on a tip end portion of the knocker arm 49.  The inner cable 5a of the independent<br>
brake operation cable 5 is connected to a tip end portion of the front arm 50.  The outer cable 5b of the independent brake operation cable 5 is movably supported by a support portion 52 provided on a front side surface of the cylinder main body 40.  This ensures that when the independent brake lever 3 is operated to pull the inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5, the front arm 50 is turned clockwise about the support shaft 48. [0055]<br>
As shown in Figs. 9 and 11, the cylinder main body 40 of the master cylinder 36 attached to the vehicle body 1 is provided, at an upper portion of an outside surface thereof, with an input-side support portion 53 for fixingly supporting the input-side outer cable 6bl of the interlocking brake operation cable 6, i.e., a cable holding member.  In addition, the cylinder main body 40 is provided, at a lower portion of the outside surface thereof, with a holder support portion 56 for slidably supporting a holder 55 through a slide bush 54. A stopper nut 58 abutting on an end face, on the side of the input-side support portion 53, of the holder support portion 56 is screw-engaged with the holder 55, and a delay spring 57 is provided between the stopper nut 58 and the input-<br>
side support portion 53 in the state of being under a predetermined compressive load, whereby the holder 55 is biased for moving toward the left side in Fig. 9.  The holder 55 is so disposed as to abut on the knocker arm 49 from the lower side. The output-side outer cable 6b2 of the interlocking brake operation cable 6 is attached to a lower end portion of the holder 55. [0056]<br>
Incidentally, the input-side support portion 53 may not necessarily be provided in the master cylinder 36, and may be provided in the vehicle body 1 in the vicinity of the master cylinder 36.  In short, it suffices for the input-side support portion 53 to be so disposed that it cannot be displaced relative to the master cylinder 36. [0057]<br>
Next, the functions of the third embodiment will be described. [0058]<br>
When both the independent brake operation system A and the interlocking brake operation system B are in non-operative conditions, the piston 42 in the master cylinder 36 is being pushed downwards by the return spring 44, so that the knocker arm 49 is turned counterclockwise by the lower end face of the piston 42,<br>
and the stopper portion 51 at the rear end portion of the knocker arm 4 9 is in abutment on the back surface of the cylinder main body 40.  In other words, the piston 42 is held in its lowest limit position.  In this instance, the knocker portion 4 9a of the knocker arm 4 9 is in abutment on the lower end face of the piston 42, as shown in Fig. 10. [0059]<br>
When the independent brake lever 3 is operated to pull the inner cable 5a of the independent brake operation cable 5 under this condition, the front arm 50 is turned clockwise about the support shaft 4 8 by the traction (pulling force) on the inner cable 5a, so that, as shown in Fig. 13, the piston 42 in the master cylinder 36 is pushed upwards by the knocker portion 4 9a provided on the front arm 50, and the piston 42 is moved upwards along the cylinder bore 41 against the biasing force of the return spring 44. As a result, the inside volume of the liquid pressure chamber 43 is reduced, and a liquid pressure is generated inside the liquid pressure chamber 43.  The liquid pressure is transmitted through the liquid pressure piping 3 7 to the caliper body 3 5 of the front wheel brake Bf.  In this manner, the front wheel brake Bf consisting of a hydraulic type disk brake operates.<br>
[0060]<br>
In this instance, as shown in Fig. 13, the knocker arm 4 9 parts from the holder 55; in this case, since the compressive load is exerted on the holder 55 by the delay spring 57 and the holder 55 is biased (pushed) downwards, the holder 55 is maintained in the initial condition. [0061]<br>
When the operating force on the independent brake lever 3 is removed, the piston 42 is returned to it initial lowest limit position by the biasing force of the return spring 44, so that the front wheel brake Bf is put into a non-operative condition. [0062]<br>
In addition, when the interlocking brake lever 4 is operated, the inner cable 6a of the operation cable 6 in the interlocking brake operation system B is first pulled, the traction (pulling force) is directly transmitted to the operation lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br, and the operation lever 7r is turned against the action of the return spring 8r, so that the rear wheel brake Br operates. Besides, in this instance, due to the reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the rear wheel brake operation cable 6 serving as an output cable of the interlocking brake operation system B, a<br><br>
force for moving the holder 55 supporting the output-side outer cable 6b2 upwards (rightwards in Fig. 9) is exerted on the holder 55.  However, while this force is smaller than a movement restricting force exerted on the holder 55 by the delay spring 57, the knocker arm 49 and the holder 55 are kept as they are. [0063]<br>
When the interlocking brake lever 4 is continuedly operated and the reaction force generated on the output-side outer cable 6b2 of the rear wheel brake operation cable 6 is increased further under this condition, the force for moving the holder 55 upwards comes to exceeds the movement restricting force exerted by the delay spring 57. Then, the holder 55 is moved upwards, and the holder 55 comes into abutment on the knocker arm 4 9 from the lower side, so that the knocker arm 4 9 is turned clockwise. As a result, as shown in Fig. 14, the piston 42 in the master cylinder 36 is pushed upwards by the knocker portion 4 9a of the knocker arm 49, thereby generating a liquid pressure in the liquid pressure chamber 43 of the master cylinder 36. Therefore, the front wheel brake Bf operates, in the same manner as in the case where the independent brake lever 3 is operated. [0064]<br>
Thus, when the interlocking brake lever 4 is operated, the rear wheel brake Br first operates, and the front wheel brake Bf operates next in an interlocked manner, with a little time lag.  This ensures that the front and rear wheels are braked substantially simultaneously while pitching of the vehicle is being prevented from occurring, so that the motorcycle is braked in a stable manner.  When the operating force on the interlocking brake lever 4 is removed, the operation lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br is returned to its initial position by the biasing force of the return spring 8r, so that the rear wheel brake Br is put into a non-operative condition.  In addition, the holder 55 is moved downwards due to the compressive load on the delay spring 57, and attendant on this, the knocker arm 49 is turned counterclockwise, so that the interlocking device 38 is returned to the condition shown in Fig. 9.  Further, since the piston 42 is returned to its lowest limit position by the biasing force of the return spring 44, the front wheel brake Bf is also put into a non-operative condition. [0065]<br>
In this way, also in the case where either one of the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br is a<br>
hydraulic type brake and the other one is a mechanical type brake, it is possible to cause the hydraulic type brake to operate singly by operating the independent brake operation cable 5, and to cause the hydraulic type brake and the mechanical type brake to operate in an interlocked manner by operating the interlocking brake operation cable 6. [0066]<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and various design modifications are possible without departure from the gist of the invention.  For example, the present invention can be applied also to motor tricycles, buggy cars and the like. [Explanation of Symbols] [0068]<br>
