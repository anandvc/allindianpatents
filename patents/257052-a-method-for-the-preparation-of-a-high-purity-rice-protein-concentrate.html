				<td>A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF A HIGH-PURITY RICE PROTEIN CONCENTRATE<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/547,153, entitled A Method for the Preparation of a High-Purity Rice Protein Concentrate, filed February 23, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a rice protein concentrate and to a method for the preparation thereof. The method comprises enzymatically hydrolyzing a rice substrate at a temperature below the denaturation temperature and at or near the isoelectric pH of the protein in the rice substrate to obtain a fraction including solubilized granular starch hydrolysate and a residue including insoluble rice protein and separating the solubilized starch hydrolysate fraction from the residue including the insoluble rice protein to obtain a rice protein concentrate and particularly a high-purity rice protein concentrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rice is a major food grain for more than half the world's population. Proteins (8%) and starch (80%) make up the two main components of rice. Even though rice protein is a desirable food ingredient, rice is processed industrially for its starch and starch hydrolysate, and the rice protein is used mainly in animal feed applications.<br>
Methods for producing solubilized rice starch hydrolysates and the separation of rice protein from the starch are known. Commonly, the separation of rice proteins from rice flour is carried out by solubilizing rice starch by heating at high temperatures which is followed by hydrolyzing using starch degrading amylases (See for example, Hansen et al., (1981) Food Technology 35:38 - 42; Chen et al., (1984) J. Sci. FoodAgric. 35: 1128 -1135; and Shin et al., (1997) Cereal Chem. 74:437 - 441 and Juliano B.O. (1984) IN STARCH: CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY, 2nd Ed. Ed. R.L. Whistler et al., Academic Press, New York, pp.507 - 528). More specifically, Mitchell et al., (U.S. Pat. No. 4,744,922) disclose a process to produce rice starch hydrolysate using conventional high temperature jet cooking processes. Slott et al., (U.S. Pat. No. 3,912,590) disclose a process to solublize rice starch, which is followed by hydrolyzing using a thermostable alpha amylase. Euber et al., (U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,344) report a process for making rice protein concentrate with<br><br>
reduced levels of manganese, aluminum and phytic acid and with improved digestibility for use in infant food formulations by solubilizing and hydrolyzing the rice starch at an elevated temperature with thermostable alpha amylase.<br>
The processes described above are performed at high temperatures and generally in the range of 90°C. At these solubilization temperatures for granular starch, the protein in rice will be denatured. It is reported that rice protein is generally denatured at temperatures above 75°C (Ju et al., (2001) J. Food Sci. 66:229 - 232). Protein denaturation results in a loss of many functional properties which play a role in food formulations. For example, the nutritional value and digestibility of rice protein concentrate produced at a high temperature treatment is lower than the nutritional value of the milk protein, casein, which is used as the industry standard. (Morita et al., (1993) J. Food Sci. 58:1393 - 1406 and Chang et al. (1993) J. Food Sci. 51:464 - 467). Therefore, as mentioned above industrially produced rice protein, which results from high temperature cooking, is predominantly sold in the animal feed market.<br>
The process of separating rice proteins from rice starch without starch solubilization presents a number of disadvantages. The process is time consuming and expensive and further the product yield is low. Additionally, high alkali, acid and surfactant compounds typically used in the process are unattractive, .particularly if the protein is intended for food applications.<br>
Rice proteins are valuable because they are hypoallergenic (Helm et al., (1996) Cereal Foods World 41: 839 - 843) and high in essential amino acids, such as methionine (Tecson et al., (1971) Cereal Chem. 48:91 - 202). Therefore, it would be desirable to improve the quality and quantity of rice protein as a by-product of starch processing by developing a process whereby rice protein, which was obtained from a rice substrate used in starch processing, was not denatured. The protein could then be used in various applications, such as in human food applications. For example, during microbial fermentations in the production of monosodium glutamate, vast amounts of rice substrate are used, and this results in the by-product of a large quantity of denatured rice protein. In China alone, it is estimated that approximately 2.6 metric tons of rice substrate would be required to meet the annual production of monosodium glutamate which exceeds 1.0 x 106 metric tons. A tremendous benefit would be gained if the production of MSG yielded a high rice protein concentrate as opposed to a denatured protein by-product.<br>
The present invention provides a method for the production of a rice protein concentrate, and particularly a high-purity rice protein concentrate obtained during starch processing wherein the process does not include subjecting a rice substrate containing<br><br>
starch and protein to a high temperature treatment but instead includes subjecting the rice substrate to temperatures below the denaturation temperature of the rice substrate protein.<br>
The rice protein concentrate produced by the method encompassed by the invention may be used in various applications, including uses in human food formulations and in animal feed. It is an additional advantage to obtain a rice protein concentrate according to the methods encompassed by the invention because in general rice protein has a high level of certain essential amino acids and low human allergenicity.<br>

The enzymes also hydrolyzes alpha-1, 6 and alpha -1,3 linkages although at much slower rates than alpha-1, 4 linkages.<br>
The term "granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme (GSHE)" or "an enzyme having granular starch hydrolyzing (GSH) activity" as used herein refers to an enzyme having the ability to hydrolyze starch in granular form.<br>
The term "recombinant" when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-<br><br>
recombinant form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all.<br>
The terms "recombinant GSHE", "recombinantly expressed GSHE" and "recombinantly produced GSHE" refer to a mature GSHE protein sequence that is produced in a host cell from a heterologous polynucleotide. The symbol "r" may be used to denote recombinant. The protein sequence of a rGSHE excludes a signal sequence. In one embodiment Humicola grisea var. thermoidea GSHE expressed in a strain of Trichoderma reesei is denoted by "rH-GSHE".<br>
The terms "native GSHE" and "nGSHE" mean a GSHE, which was derived from a host organism wherein the polynucleotide encoding the GSHE is endogenous to the host organism. Preferred native GSHEs are derived from a Humicola grisea strain or an Aspergillus awamori strain.<br>
The term "glycosylation" refers to the post-transcriptional modification of a protein by the addition of carbohydrate moieties, wherein the carbohydrate is either N-linked or O-linked resulting in a glucoprotein. An N-linked carbohydrate moiety of a glycoprotein is attached by a glycosidic bond to the β-amide nitrogen of an asparagine residue. An O-linked carbohydrate is attached by a glycosidic bond to a protein through the hydroxy group of a serine or a threonine residue.<br>
A "signal sequence" means a sequence of amino acids bound to the N-terminal portion of a protein, which facilitates the secretion of the mature form of the protein outside the cell. The definition of a signal sequence is a functional one. The mature form of the extracellular protein lacks the signal sequence which is cleaved off during the secretion process.<br>

The term "nucleic acid" means either DNA, RNA, single stranded or double stranded and chemical modifications thereof. The terms "nucleic acid" and "polynucleotide" may be used interchangeably herein. Because the genetic code is degenerate, more than one codon may be used to encode a particular amino acid, and the present invention encompasses polynucleotides, which encode a particular amino acid sequence.<br>
A "vector" refers to a polynucleotide sequence designed to introduce nucleic acids into one or more cell types. Vectors include cloning vectors, expression vectors, shuttle vectors, plasmids, phage particles, cassettes and the like.<br><br>
An "expression vector* as used herein means a DNA construct comprising a DNA sequence which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting expression of the DNA in a suitable host.

B. Preferred Embodiments. Rice Substrates:<br>
A rice substrate to be employed in the process of the invention may be obtained from any known source. In some preferred embodiments, the rice substrate is rice flour and in other preferred embodiments the rice substrate is a polished rice substrate. While not meant to limit the invention in any manner, in general rice flour from grain contains about 6 -10% protein (N x 5.95); about 70 - 82% carbohydrate; about 9 -12% moisture; about 0.4 -1.5% crude fat; about 0.6 to 0.8% ash and about 0.2 to 0.6% fiber.<br>
Rice proteins found in the grain have limited solubility in water. These proteins are predominantly found as insoluble (alkali-soluble) glutelins (about 80 - 90%); salt-soluble globulins (7 -15%) water-soluble albumins (9 -10%) and alcohol-soluble prolamins (about 2 - 5%). See, Houston et al., (1970) Cereal Chem. 47:5; Perdon et ah, (1978) Phytochem. 17:351, and Landers et al., (1994) Cereal Chem 71:409 - 411.<br>

At least one of the starch hydrolyzing enzymes used in the methods encompassed by the invention is a granular starch hydrolyzing enzymes (GSHEs). Some granular starch hydrolyzing enzymes have glucoamylase activity and some of these enzymes have alpha amylase activity (See, Tosi et al., (1993) Can. J. Microbiol. 39:846 -855 and Kanlayakrit et<br><br>
-<br>
-al.r(1387) J.Ferment.Techno/.65:379 - 385). Suitable GSH enzymes maybe naturally occurring as well as recombinant and mutant GSH enzymes. Naturally occurring GSHEs have been recovered from fungal cells such as Humicola sp., Aspergillus sp., Mucor sp. and Rhizopus sp. A Rhizopus oryzae GSHE has been described in Ashikari et al., (1986) Agric. Biol. Chem. 50:957-964 and USP 4,863,864. A Humicola grisea GSHE has been described in Allison et al., (1992) Curr. Genet. 21:225-229 and European Patent No. 171218. The gene encoding this enzyme is also known in the art as g/a1. An Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi GSHE has been described by Hayashida et al., (1989) Agric. Biol. Chem 53:923-929. An Aspergillus shirousami GSHE has been described by Shibuya et al., (1990)&gt;Agric. Biol. Chem. 54:1905-1914.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the GSHE is recovered from fungi including ATCC 16453, NRRL 15219, NRRL 15220, NRRL 15221, NRRL 15222, NRRL 15223, NRRL 15224 and NRRL 15225 as well as genetically altered strains thereof. (EP 0 171218).<br>
In one embodiment, a GSHE may be derived from a strain of Humicola grisea, particularly a strain of Humicola grisea var. thermoidea (H-GSHE) (see, USP 4,618,579).<br>
In one embodiment, a GSHE may be derived from a strain a! Aspergillus awamori, particularly a strain of A. awamori var. kawachi (A-GSHE) (See, Hayashida et al., (1989) Agric. Biol. Chem. 53:923-929).<br>

A polynucleotide or polypeptide having a certain percent (e.g., 80%, 85%, 90% or 99%) of sequence identity with another sequence means that when aligned, that percent of bases or amino acid residues are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and the percent homology or identity can be determined using any suitable<br><br>
software program known in the art, for example those described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et al., eds 1987 Supplement 30, section 7.7.18). Preferred programs include GCG Pileup program, FASTA and BLAST. Another preferred alignment program is ALIGN Plus and TFASTA.<br>
In a further embodiment, a GSHE enzyme may be derived from a strain of Rhizopus. Such as the enzyme derived from the Koji strain of R niveus (sold under the trade name "CU CONC") or the enzyme from Rhizopus sold under the trade name GLUCZYME.<br>
Alpha Amylases -<br>
In some of the embodiments encompassed by the invention, the granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme will be combined with an alpha amylase. Alpha amylases are microbial enzymes having an E.C. number, E.G. 3.2.1.1-3 and in particular E.C 3.2.1.1. In some embodiments, the alpha amylase is a thermostable bacterial alpha amylase and in other embodiments, the alpha amylase is a fungal alpha amylase. Suitable alpha amylases may be naturally occurring as well as recombinant and mutant alpha amylases. In some particularly preferred embodiments, the alpha amylase is derived from a Bacillus species. Preferred Bacillus species include B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, B. lentus, B. licheniformis, B. coagulans, and B. amyloliquefaciens (USP 5,763,385; USP 5,824,532; USP 5,958,739; USP 6,008,026 and USP 6,361,809). Particularly preferred alpha amylases are derived from Bacillus strains B. stearothermophilus, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis. Also reference is made to strains having ATCC 39709; ATCC 11945; ATCC 6598; ATCC 6634; ATCC 8480; ATCC 9945A and NCIB 8059.<br>
Commercially available alpha amylases contemplated for use in the methods of the invention include; SPEZYME AA; SPEZYME FRED; GZYME G997 (Genencor International Inc.') and TERMAMYL 120-L, LC, SC and SUPRA (Novozymes Biotech.).<br>
Glucoamylases -<br>
Glucoamylases (E.G. 3.2.1.3) are enzymes that remove successive glucose units from the non-reducing ends of starch. The enzyme can hydrolyze both linear and branched glucosidic linkages of starch, amylose and amylopectin. While glucoamylase may be derived from bacteria, plants and fungi, preferred glucoamylases encompassed by the present are derived from fungal strains. Suitable glucoamylase include not only naturally occurring glucoamylases but also recombinant and mutant glucoamylases<br>
Glucoamylases secreted from fungi of the genera Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Humicola and Mucor have been derived from fungal strains, including Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus<br><br>
oryzea, Aspergillus awamori, Rhizopus niveus, Rhizopus oryzae, Mucor miehe, Humicola grisea, Aspergillus shirousami and Humicola (Thermomyces) laniginosa (See, Boel et a/. (1984) EMBO J. 3:1097-1102; WO 92/00381; WO 00/04136; Chen et a/., (1996) Prof. Eng. 9:499-505; Taylor et a/., (1978) Carbohydrate Res. 61:301 -308 and Jensen et a/., (1988) Can. J. Microbiol. 34:218-223).<br>
Enzymes having glucoamylase activity used commercially are produced for examples, from Aspergillus niger (trade name OPTIDEX L-400 from Genencor International Inc.) or Rhizopus species (trade name CU.CONC. from Shin Ninon Chemicals, Japan and trade name GLUCZYME from Amano Pharmaceuticals, Japan).<br>
Recombinantly produced GSHEs -<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the GHSE used in a method encompassed by the invention is a recombinantly expressed GSHE (rGSHE) obtained from a filamentous fungal strain, which has been genetically engineered to express a heterologous polynucleotide that encodes a GSHE derived from a source other than the host strain.<br>
In some embodiments, the filamentous fungal strain is a strain of Aspergillus sp., Trichodermasp., Fusarium sp., or Penicillium sp. Particularly preferred fungal hosts include A. nidulans, A. awamori, A. oryzae, A. aculeatus, A. niger, A. japonicus, T. reesei, T. viride, F. oxysporum, and F. so/an/. Aspergillus strains are disclosed in Ward et a/., (1993) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 39:738-743 and Goedegebuur et a/., (2002) Curr. Gene 41:89-98. In a most preferred embodiment, the host is a Trichoderrna strain and particularly a T. reesei strain. Strains of T. reesei are known and nonlimiting examples include ATCC No. 13631, ATCC No. 26921, ATCC No. 56764, ATCC No. 56765, ATCC NO. 56767 and NRRL 15709. In some preferred embodiments, the host strain is a derivative of RL-P37. RL-P37 is disclosed in Sheir-Neiss et a/., (1984; Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 20:46 - 53.<br>
A host strain which expresses GSHE may have be previously manipulated through genetic engineering. In some embodiments, various genes of the fungal host have been inactivated. These genes include, for example genes encoding cellulolytic enzymes, such as endoglucanases (EG) and exocellobiohydolases (CBH) (e.g., cbh"\, cbh2, eg/1 and eg/3). US Patent No. 5,650,322 discloses derivative strains of RL-P37 having deletions in the cbh1gene and the cbh2 gene.<br>
In some embodiments, the fungal host has been genetically engineered to comprise a polynucleotide encoding a GSHE derived from Humicola grisea. In one embodiment the rGSHE will have at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 93%, 95%, 97%, 98% and 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set<br><br>
forth in SEQ ID NO:3. In other embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding the GSHE of SEQ ID NO:3 will have at least 70% sequence identity with the sequence of SEQ ID N0:1.<br>
In other embodiments, the fungal host has been genetically engineered to express a polynucleotide encoding a GSHE derived from Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi. In one embodiment the rGSHE will have at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 93%, 95%, 97%, 98% and 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:7. In other embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding the GSHE of SEQ ID NO:7 will have at least 70% sequence identity with the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5.<br>
Vectors and Fungal Transformation:<br>
According to the invention the heterologous polynucleotide encoding a GSHE may be introduced into a fungal host cell by a vector, particularly an expression vector which comprises regulatory sequence operably linked to a GSHE coding sequence. The vector may be any vector which when introduced into a fungal host cell is integrated into the host cell genome and is replicated. Reference is made to the Fungal Genetics Stock Center Catalogue of Strains (www.FGSC. net) for a list of vectors. Also, examples of suitable expression and/or integration vectors may be found in Sambrook et al., (1989) supra, Ausubel (1987) supra, van den Hondel et al. (1991) in Bennett and Lasure Eds. MORE GENE MANIPULATIONS IN FUNGI, Academic Press pp. 396-428 and USP 5,874,276. Particularly useful vectors include pFB6, pBR322, PUC18, pUC100 and pENTR/D.<br>
In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a GSHE is operably linked to a suitable promoter, which shows transcriptional activity in the fungal host cell. The promoter may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell. Preferably, the promoter is useful in a Trichoderma host and suitable nonlimiting examples of promoters include c/&gt;/?1, cbh2, eg/1, and eg/2. In one embodiment, the promoter is one that is native to the host cell. For example, when T. reesei is the host, the promoter is a native T. reesei promoter. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter is T. reesei cbhl, which is an inducible promoter and has been deposited in GenBank under Accession No. D86235. An inducible promoter is a promoter that is active under environmental or developmental regulation. In another embodiment the promoter is one that is heterologous to the fungal host cell. Other examples of useful promoters include promoters from A. awamori and A. niger glucoamylase genes (See, Nunberg et al., (1984) Mol. Cell Bid. 4:2306-2315 and Boel et al., (1984) EMBOJ. 3:1581-1585). Also the promoters of T. reesei x/n1 gene and cellobiohydrolase 1 gene may be useful (EPA 137280A1).<br><br>
In some embodiments, the GSHE coding sequence is operably linked to a signal sequence. The DNA encoding the signal sequence is preferably that which is naturally associated with the GSHE gene to be expressed. Preferably, the signal sequence is encoded by a Humicola grisea or Aspergillus awamori gene which encodes a GSHE. More preferably the signal sequence has at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, and at least 99% sequence identity to the signal sequence depicted in Figure 2A and 6A. In additional embodiments, a signal sequence and a promoter sequence comprising a DNA construct or vector to be introduced into a fungal host cell are derived from the same source. For example, in some embodiments, the signal sequence is the cdh1 signal sequence which is operably linked to a cdh1 promoter.<br>
In some embodiments, the expression vector also includes a termination sequence. In one embodiment, the termination sequence and the promoter sequence are derived from the same source. In another embodiment, the termination sequence is homologous to the host cell. A particularly suitable terminator sequence is cbh1 derived from a Trichoderma strain and particularly T. reesei. Other useful fungal terminators include the terminator from A. niger or A. awamori glucoamylase gene (Nunberg et a/. (1984) supra, and Boel et at., (1984) supra).<br>
In some embodiments, an expression vector includes a selectable marker. Examples of preferred selectable markers include ones which confer antimicrobial resistance (e.g., hygromycin and phleomycin). Nutritional selective markers also find use in the present invention including those markers known in the art as amdS, argB and pyr4. Markers useful in vector systems for transformation of Trichoderma are described in Finkelstein, chapter 6 in BIOTECHNOLOGY OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGI, Finkelstein et al. Eds. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA (1992), Chap. 6. and Kinghorn et al. (1992) APPLIED MOLECULAR GENETICS OF FILAMENTOUS FUNGI, Blackie Academic and Professional, Chapman and Hall, London). In a preferred embodiment, the selective marker is the amdS gene, which encodes the enzyme acetamidase allowing transformed cells to grow on acetamide as a nitrogen source. (See, Kelley et al., (1985) EMBO J. 4:475-479 and Penttila et al., (1987) Gene 61:155 - 164).<br>
An expression vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a GSHE may be any vector which is capable of replicating autonomously in a given fungal host organism or of integrating into the DNA of the host. In some embodiments, an expression vector is a plasmid. In preferred embodiments, two types of expression vectors for obtaining expression of genes are contemplated.<br>
The first expression vector comprises DNA sequences in which the promoter, GHSE coding region, and terminator all originate from the gene to be expressed. In some<br><br>
-<br>
embodiments, gene truncation is obtained by deleting undesired DMA sequences (e.g., coding for unwanted domains) to leave the domain to be expressed under control of its own transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences.<br>
The second type of expression vector is preassembled and contains sequences required for high-level transcription and a selectable marker. In some embodiments, the coding region for a GSHE gene or part thereof is inserted into this general-purpose expression vector such that it is under the transcriptional control of the expression constructs promoter and terminator sequences. In some embodiments, genes or part thereof are inserted downstream of the strong ob/Tl promoter.<br>
Methods used to ligate a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding a GSHE, a promoter, a terminator and other sequences and to insert them into a suitable vector are well known in the art. Linking is generally accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. (See, Sambrook (1989) supra, and Bennett and Lasure, MORE GENE MANIPULATIONS IN FUNGI, Academic Press, San Diego (1991) pp 70 -76.). Additionally, vector can be constructed using known recombination techniques (e.g. Invitrogen Life Technologies, Gateway Technology).<br>
Where it is desired to obtain a fungal host cell having one or more inactivated genes known methods may be used (See, US Patent No. 5,246,853; US Patent No. 5,475,101 and WO 92/06209). Gene inactivation may be accomplished by complete or partial deletion, by insertional inactivation or by any other means which renders a gene nonfunctional for its intended purpose (such that the gene is prevented from expression of a functional protein). Any gene from a Trichoderma sp. or other filamentous fungal host, which has been cloned can be deleted, for example cbh"\, cbh2, eg/1 and eg/2. In some embodiments, gene deletion is accomplished by inserting a form of the desired gene to be inactivated into a plasmid by known methods. The deletion plasmid is then cut at an appropriate restriction enzyme site(s), internal to the desired gene coding region and the gene coding sequence or part thereof is replaced with a selectable marker. Flanking DNA sequences from the locus of the gene to be deleted (preferably about between 0.5 to 2.0 kb) remain on either side of the marker gene. An appropriate deletion plasmid will generally have unique restriction enzyme sites present therein to enable the fragment containing the deleted gene, including the flanking DNA sequences and the selectable marker gene to be removed as a single linear piece.<br>
Introduction of a DNA construct or vector into a host cell includes techniques such as transformation; electroporation; nuclear microinjection; transduction; transfection, including lipofection mediated and DEAE-Dextrin mediated transfection; incubation with<br><br>
calcium phosphate DNA precipitate;high velocity bombardment with DNA-coated microprojectiles; and protoplast fusion. General transformation techniques are taught in Ausubel et al., (1987), supra chapter 9 and Sambrook (1989) supra. More specifically methods of transformation for filamentous fungi are disclosed in Campbell et al., (1989) Curr. Genet. 16:53-56. Specifically, to effect the expression of heterologous protein in Trichoderma reference is made to USP 6,022,725; USP 6,268,328; Harkki et al. (1991); Enzyme Microb. Technol. 13:227-233; Harkki et al., (1989) Bio Technol. 7:596-603; EP 244,234; and EP 215,594. Reference is also made to Nevalainen et al., "The Molecular Biology of Trichoderma and its Application to the Expression of Both Homologous and Heterologous Genes", in MOLECULAR INDUSTRIAL MYCOLOGY, Eds. Leong and Berka, Marcel Dekker Inc., NY (1992) pp. 129 -148. Reference is also made to Cao et al., (2000) Sci.9:991 -1001 for transformation of Aspergillus strains.<br>
Preferably genetically stable transformants may be constructed with vector systems whereby the nucleic acid encoding GSHE is stably integrated into a host strain chromosome. Transformants may then be purified by known techniques.<br>
In one nonlimiting example, stable transformants including an amdS marker are distinguished from unstable transformants by their faster growth rate and the formation of circular colonies with a smooth, rather than ragged outline on solid culture medium containing acetamide. Additionally, in some cases a further test of stability is conducted by growing the transformants on solid non-selective medium (i.e. lacking acetamide), harvesting spores from this culture medium and determining the percentage of these spores which will subsequently germinate and grow on selective medium containing acetamide. Alternatively, other methods known in the art may be used to select transformants.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the preparation of Trichoderma sp. for transformation involves the preparation of protoplasts from fungal mycelia. (See, Campbell et al.,(1989) Curr. Genet. 16:53-56). In some embodiments, the mycelia are obtained from germinated vegetative spores. The mycelia are treated with an enzyme that digests the cell wall resulting in protoplasts. The protoplasts are then protected by the presence of an osmotic stabilizer in the suspending medium. These stabilizers include sorbitol, mannitol, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate and the like. Usually the concentration of these stabilizers varies between 0.8 M and 1.2 M. It is preferable to use about a 1.2 M solution of sorbitol in the suspension medium.<br>
Uptake of DNA into the host Trichoderma sp. strain is dependent upon the calcium ion concentration. Generally between about 10 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM CaCI2 is used in an uptake solution. Besides the need for the calcium ion in the uptake solution, other items<br><br>
generally included are a buffering system such as TE buffer (10 Mm Tris, pH 7.4; 1 mM EDTA) or 10 mM MOPS, pH 6.0buffer (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). It is believed that the polyethylene glycol acts to fuse the cell membranes thus permitting the contents of the medium to be delivered into the cytoplasm of the Trichoderma sp. strain and the plasmid DNA is transferred to the nucleus. This fusion frequently leaves multiple copies of the plasmid DNA tenderly integrated into the host chromosome.<br>
Usually a suspension containing the Trichoderma sp. protoplasts or cells that have been subjected to a permeability treatment at a density of 105 to 107/mL, preferably 2 x 106/mL are used in transformation. A volume of 100μL of these protoplasts or cells in an appropriate solution (e.g., 1.2 M sorbitol; 50 mM CaCI2) are mixed with the desired DNA. Generally a high concentration of PEG is added to the uptake solution. From 0.1 to 1 volume of 25% PEG 4000 can be added to the protoplast suspension. However, it is preferable to add about 0.25 volumes to the protoplast suspension. Additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide, heparin, spermidine, potassium chloride and the like may also be added to the uptake solution and aid in transformation. Similar procedures are available for other fungal host cells. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,022,725 and 6,268,328, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Generally, the mixture is then incubated at approximately 0°C for a period of between 10 to 30 minutes. Additional PEG is then added to the mixture to further enhance the uptake of the desired gene or DNA sequence. The 25% PEG 4000 is generally added in volumes of 5 to 15 times the volume of the transformation mixture; however, greater and lesser volumes may be suitable. The 25% PEG 4000 is preferably about 10 times the volume of the transformation mixture. After the PEG is added, the transformation mixture is then incubated either at room temperature or on ice before the addition of a sorbitol and CaClg solution. The protoplast suspension is then further added to molten aliquots of a growth medium. This growth medium permits the growth of transformants only. One skilled in the art is well aware that similar procedures and methods may be used to transform host cells and heterologously express other enzymes such as starch hydrolyzing enzymes in the host cells.<br>
Cell culture:<br>
Appropriate host cells are generally cultured in a standard medium containing physiological salts and nutrients, such as described in Pourquie, J. et al., BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS OF CELLULOSE DEGRADATION, eds. Aubert, J. P. et al., Academic Press, pp. 71-86,1988 and llmen, M. et al., (1997) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63:1298-1306. Also<br><br>
reference is made to common commercially prepared media such as Yeast Malt Extract (YM) broth, Luria Bertani (LB) broth and Sabouraud Dextrose (SD) broth.<br>
Culture conditions are also standard, e.g., cultures are incubated at approximately 28°C in appropriate media in shaker cultures or fermenters until desired levels of GSHE expression are achieved. Preferred culture conditions for a given filamentous fungus may be found in the scientific literature and/or from the source of the fungi such as the American Type Culture Collection and Fungal Genetics Stock Center (www.FGSC.net).<br>
After fungal growth has been established, the cells are exposed to conditions effective to cause or permit the expression of a starch hydrolyzing enzymes and particularly a GSHE as defined herein. In cases where a GSHE coding sequence is under the control of an inducible promoter, the inducing agent, e.g., a sugar, metal salt or antibiotics, is added to the medium at a concentration effective to induce GSHE expression.<br>
Identification of GSHE Activity:<br>
In order to evaluate the expression of a starch hydrolyzing enzyme by a cell line that has been transformed with a heterologous polynucleotide encoding the starch hydrolyzing enzyme e.g. a GSHE, assays can be carried out at the protein level, the RNA level or by use of functional bioassays particular to glucoamylase activity and/or production.<br>
In general, assays employed to analyze the expression of a GSHE include, Northern blotting, dot blotting (DNA or RNA analysis), RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), or in situ hybridization, using an appropriately labeled probe (based on the nucleic acid coding sequence) and conventional Southern blotting and autoradiography.<br>
In addition, the production and/or expression of a starch hydrolyzing enzyme may be measured in a sample directly, for example, by assays directly measuring reducing sugars such as glucose in the culture media and by assays for measuring glucoamylase activity,.expression and/or production. For example, substrates useful for assaying GSHE activity include granular starch substrates. For example, glucose concentration may be determined by any convenient method such as by using glucose reagent kit No 15-UV (Sigma Chemical Co.) or an instrument such as Technicon Autoanalyzer. Also reference is made to glucose oxidase kits and glucose hexose kits commercially available from Instrumentation Lab. (Lexington, MA). Glucoamylase activity may be assayed by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (See, Goto et al., (1994) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 58:49 - 54). In one nonlimiting example, a rGSHE has the ability to hydrolyze granular<br><br>
starch in a^S%^tarch~solids suspension in water to a solution of saccharides of at least 90%, 95% and 97% wt glucose, dry substance basis.<br>
In addition, protein expression, may be evaluated by immunological methods, such as immunohistochemical staining of cells, tissue sections or immunoassay of tissue culture medium, e.g., by Western blot or ELISA. Such immunoassays can be used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate expression of a starch hydrolyzing enzyme. The details of such methods are known to those of skill in the art and many reagents for practicing such methods are commercially available.<br>
Exemplary assays include ELISA, competitive immunoassays, radioimmunoassays, Western blot, indirect immunofluorescent assays and the like. In general, commercially available antibodies and/or kits may be used for the quantitative immunoassay of the expression level of a GSHE.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the GSHE expressed by a recombinant Trichoderma host will be greater than 1 gram protein per liter (g/L) of culture media. In some embodiments the amount of GSHE expressed by a recombinant Trichoderma host will be greater than 2 g/L of culture media. In other embodiments the amount of GSHE expressed by a recombinant Trichoderma host will be greater than 5 g/L of culture media. Yet in other embodiments the amount of GSHE expressed by a recombinant Trichoderma host will be greater than 10 g/L of culture media. The amount of expressed GSHE may in some instances be greater than 20 g/L, greater than 25 g/L, greater than 30g/L and greater than 50 g/L of culture media.<br>
Methods for Purifying Starch Hvdrolvzina Enzymes:<br>
In general, a starch hydrolyzing enzyme (e.g., nGSHE or rGSHE) produced in cell culture is secreted into the medium and may be purified or isolated, e.g., by removing unwanted components from the cell culture medium. In some cases, a GSHE may be produced in a cellular form necessitating recovery from a cell lysate. In such cases the enzyme is purified from the cells in which it was produced using techniques routinely employed by those of skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography (Tilbeurgh etal., (1984) FEBS Lett. 16:215); ion-exchange chromatographic methods (Goyal etal., (1991) Biores. Technol. 36:37; Fliess etal., (1983) Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 17:314; Bhikhabhai etal., (1984) J. Appl. Biochem. 6:336; and Ellouz et a/., (1987) Chromatography 396:307), including ion-exchange using materials with high resolution power (Medve etal., (1998) J. Chromatography A 808:153; hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Tomaz and Queiroz, (1999) J. Chromatography A 865:123; two-phase partitioning (Brumbauer, et a/., (1999) Bioseparation 7:287);<br><br>
ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; and gel filtration using, e.g., Sephadex G-75.<br>
Process Conditions:<br>
The rice substrate, preferably in slurry form, is contacted or incubated with the starch hydrolyzing enzymes to hydrolyze the granular starch of the rice substrate. The GSHE may be supplied in a cell free extract (such that the GSHE is isolated from a culture medium) or supplied in the culture medium (fermentation broth), which includes fungal cells that express and secrete GSHE.<br>
In some embodiments, a GSHE may be added to a composition comprising a rice substrate in an amount of between about 0.001 to 15.0 GSHE Units (U) /g ds of the slurry adjusted to 10 - 55% dry solids. In other embodiments, a GSHE may be added to a compositions comprising a rice substrate in an amount of 0.01 to 10.0 GSHE Units (U)/g starch dry solids (ds) of a slurry adjusted to 10 - 55% dry solids.

In some preferred embodiments, the GSHE will have glucoamylase activity and the second starch hydrolyzing enzyme will be an alpha amylase. As understood by those in the art, the quantity of alpha amylase used in the methods of the present invention will depend on the enzymatic activity of the alpha amyiase. In general, an amount of about 0.001 to 5.0 kg of the alpha amylase is added to a metric ton (MT) of the rice substrate. In some embodtments, an amount of 0.01 to 5.0 kg of the alpha amylase is added to a metric ton (MT) of the rice substrate. Although in some embodiments the alpha amylase is added in an amount about 0.05 to 4.0 kg per MT. In other embodiments, the alpha amylase is added in an amount of about 0.1 to 2.5 kg per MT and also about 0.5 to 1.5 kg per MT. In further embodiments, other quantities are utilized. For example, generally an amount of between about 0.01 to 1.5 kg of GZYME G997 or SPEZYME FRED (Genencor International Inc.) is added to a MT of starch. In other embodiments, the enzyme is added in an amount between about 0.05 to 1.0 kg; between about 0.1 to 0.6 kg; between about 0.2 to 0.6 kg and between about 0.4 to 0.6 kg of GZYME G997 or SPEZYME FRED per MT of starch.<br><br>
In some embodiments, a GSHE will be added with an alpha amylase to the rice substrate for incubation essentially simultaneously. However, in other embodiments the GSHE and alpha amylase are added sequentially, but in general the hydrolyzing enzymes will be added within about 1 to 60 minutes of each other and also within about 1 to 30 minutes of each other.<br>
In some embodiments, the ratio of alpha amylase units to GSHE units (alpha amylase:GSHE) encompassed by the methods of the invention will be in the range of 15:1 to 1:15 and in some embodiments in the range of 10:1 to 1:10. In other embodiments, the ratio will be in the range of 5:1 to 1:5 and in further embodiments, the alpha amylase:GSHE will be 4:1 to 1:4. In preferred embodiments the ratio will be about 2:1 to 1:4 and most preferably about 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
In some embodiments, the mixture including the rice substrate and the hydrolyzing enzymes are incubated at a temperature equal to or below the denaturation temperature of the proteins comprising the rice substrate. In some embodiments, the temperature is below about 72°C, 70°C, 68°C, 65°C, 63°C, 60°C, 58°C, 55°C, 50°C, 45°C, and 40°C but not less than 10°C. In other embodiments, the process is conducted at a temperature of between about 70°C and 50°C. In further embodiments, the process is conducted at a temperature of between about 70°C to 55°C and also between about 65°C to 55°C.-<br>
In some embodiments, the mixture including the rice substrate and the starch hydrolyzing enzymes is incubated at a pH in the range of about pH 3.0 to pH 6.5; also in the range of about pH 3.0 to pH 6.0; in the range of about pH 3.0 to pH 5.5; in the range of about pH 3.5 to pH 5.0; in the range of about pH 3.0 to pH 4.0; in the range of about pH 4.5 to 6.5, and in the range of about pH 5.0 to 6.0.<br>
In some embodiments, the mixture including the rice substrate and starch hydrolyzing enzymes (and preferably a GSHE and an alpha amylase) incubated at a temperature and pH as indicated above, are incubated for a period of time of about 2 to 100 hours, about 5 to 100 hours, about 10 to 100 hours, about 5 to 50 hours, about 10 to 50 hours, and about 10-24 hours.<br>
In some embodiments, at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% and 99% of the dry solids of the rice substrate are converted into a solublized starch hydrolysate. In some embodiments, the dry solids of the rice substrate are completely solublized. Preferably, the soluble starch hydrolysate is glucose and most preferably the yield of glucose as a percent of the total solublized dry solids is at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 95.5%, 96%, 96.5%, 97%, 97.5%, 98%, 98.5%, 99% and 99.5%.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, at least 80%, 85% and 90% of the granular starch of the rice substrate is soiubilized and hydrolyzed in a time period of 24 hours. In other embodiments, at least 95% of the granular starch of the rice substrate is solublized and hydrolyzed in a time period of 24 hours. In yet other embodiments, at least 98% of the granular starch of the rice substrate is solublized and hydrolyzed in a time period of 24 hours.<br>
In some embodiments, the composition including the rice substrate and starch hydrolyzing enzymes (e.g. an alpha amylase and GSHE) will be incubated at a pH of between about 5.0 to 6.0 for a sufficient time period (for example, between 2 and 96 hours). In some embodiments, the pH of the incubated slurry will be lowered to a pH of about 3.0 to 4.0. This lowering of the pH causes termination of the enzyme reaction on the rice substrate.<br>
After a sufficient incubation time period, a fraction, comprising the solublized rice starch hydrofysate, is separated from the incubated slurry leaving a residue, which comprises a substantially insoluble rice protein, concentrate. One skilled in the art is well aware of methods to accomplish separation. In genera!, some of these separation methods include centrifugation; conventional filtration methods and membrane separation processes.<br>
The protein content (N x 5. 95) of the residue comprising the rice protein concentrate is greater than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. In some embodiments, the protein content of the rice protein concentrate is in the range of about 10% to 60%; in the range of about 10% to 50%, in the range of about 20% to 45%, and in the range of about 30% to 40%.<br>
In other embodiments, a high-purity rice protein concentrate will be obtained. In some embodiments, the high-purity rice protein concentrate is obtained by a second enzymatic hydrolysis step whereby the residue, which includes the substantially insoluble rice protein concentrate and which is obtained from the first enzymatic hydrolysis is further incubated for a period of time and at a temperature and pH as indicated above to hydrolyze remaining granular or insoluble starch. In some embodiments, the enzyme hydrolysis of starch remaining in the residue will be terminated by lowering the pH to a value lower than the pH of the incubation, for example from pH 5.5 to a pH in the range of pH 3.0 - 4.0, at a temperature of about 55°C to 60°C. The soluble rice starch hydrolysate will then be separated from the residue as described above to obtain a high-purity rice protein concentrate.<br>
In this embodiment, the same starch hydrolyzing enzymes may be used as described above. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the starch hydrolyzing<br><br>
enzymes will be a GSHE.In other preferred embodiments, aGSHE may be Usec in combination with an alpha amylase, and in other preferred embodiments, a GSHE may be used in combination with a glucoamylase. However, neither the first nor second enzymatic hydrolysis of the process is limited to the use of only these enzymes. Other enzymes may be used in the process and these include but are not limited to cellulases, pectinases, pullulanases and beta glucanases.<br>
The protein content (N x 5.95) of the high-purity rice protein concentrate is generally greater than 60%, 63%, 65%, 68%, 70% and 75%. In some embodiments, the high-purity rice protein concentrate will have a protein content of about 65% or greater and also about 70% or greater.<br>
The rice protein concentrate or high-purity rice protein concentrate obtained in accordance with the process may be dried using conventional and well-known techniques, e.g., vacuum drying, spray drying and freeze drying. In some embodiments, the moisture content of the rice protein concentrate obtained according to the invention will be below about 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3% and 2%. In some embodiments, the obtained high-purity protein concentrate will be dried to a moisture content below 6%, 5%, 4%, 3% and also 2%. In some embodiments, the moisture content will be between about 2% to 5%.<br>
The protein concentrate and high-purity protein concentrate obtained according to the methods herein may have improved characteristics over a protein fraction obtained by starch processing methods using conventional high temperature treatments. In some embodiments, the protein concentrate and high-purity protein concentrate include proteins having greater solubility at alkaline pH levels and particularly at pH levels of 10.0 as compared to the solubility of proteins in protein residues obtained from prior art processes used in starch processing. In some embodiments, the solubility at pH 10 will be at least 20%, at least 40% and at least 50%. In further embodiments, the protein concentrate and high-purity protein concentrate include proteins having greater solubility at acidic pH levels and particularly at pH levels of 2.0 as compared to the solubility of proteins in protein residues obtained from prior art processes used in starch processing. In some embodiments, the solubility at pH 2.0 will be at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25% and at least 30%.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the protein concentrate and high-purity protein concentrate obtained according to the invention will have an amino acid composition wherein the percent of certain amino acids will be increased as compared to the amino acid profile of the protein fraction of a residue obtained from prior art methods used in starch processing. For example in some embodiments, the amount of glutamic acid,<br><br>
valine, leucine, proline, methionine, arginine aspartic acid, or alanine will be greater in a protein concentrate obtained according to the invention.<br>

General Methods:<br>
Rice Substrates - White rice flour, Elephant Brand was purchased from Thai Better Foods, Co., Ltd. Bangpong, Thailand.<br>
Total Protein Analysis - The total nitrogen content of the rice flour and rice protein preparation was determined by the Kjeldhal method (See Methods 22B608, American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) 1983, St Paul, MN). Protein content (%) was calculated using the mortification factor of 5.95 for total nitrogen (Juliano B. O. (1985) Rice: Chemistry and Technology; AACC, St. Paul MN).<br>
Determination of Total Starch Content - The total starch content was determined by the enzyme-enzyme starch liquefaction and saccharification process. In a typical analysis,<br><br>
two grams (g) of the dry sample were taken in a 100 ml Kohlraucsh flask and 45 ml of MOPS buffer pH 7.0 was added. The slurry was stirred well for 30 min. 1.0 ml SPEZYME FRED (1:50 diluted in H2O) was added and heated to boiling for 3 - 5 min. The flask was placed in an autoclave maintained at 121°C) for 15 min. After autoclaving, the flask was placed in a water bath maintained at 95°C and 1.0 ml of 1:50 diluted SPEZYME FRED was added and incubated for 45 min. The pH was adjusted to pH 4.2, the temperature was reduced to 60°C and then 20 ml acetate buffer pH 4.2 was added to the mixture. Saccharification was carried out by adding 1.0 ml of 1:100 diluted OPTIDEX L-400 (Genencor International, Inc.) and the incubation was continued for another 18 hours at 60°C. The enzyme reaction was terminated by heating at 95°C for 10 min. Total sugar composition was determined by HPLC analysis using glucose as a standard. The soluble starch hydrolysate from water extraction of the sample at room temperature without enzymatic treatment was subtracted from the total sugar.<br>
Oligosaccharides Analysis -  The composition of the reaction products of oligosaccharides was measured by HPLC (Beckman System Gold 32 Karat Fullerton,<br>
i<br>
California, USA) equipped with a HPLC column (Rezex 8 u8% H, Monosaccharides), maintained at 50°C fitted with a refractive index (Rl) detector (ERC-7515A, Rl Detector from The Anspec Company, Inc.). Dilute sulfuric acid (0.01 N) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml per minute. Twenty microliter of 4.0% solution was injected on to the column. The column separates based on the molecular weight of the saccharides. For example a designation of DP1 is a monosacchride, such as glucose; a designation of DP2 is a disaccharide, such as maltose; a designation of DPS is a trisaccharide, such as maltotriose and the designation DP4+ is an oligosaccharide having a degree of polymerization (DP) of 4 or greater.<br>
Relative solubilization of the solids - A conventional low temperature jet cooking process was used to solublize the rice starch (See, U.S. Patent 3,912,590). The clear supernatant was used to measured the Brix (ABBE Refractometer, American Optical Corporation, Scientific Instrument Division, Buffalo, New York ). The Brix for the solublized starch from 30% rice flour slurry (300 grams rice flour in 700 g dH2O) under a low temperature jet process was taken at 100% solubilization and used to calculate the percent relative solubilization of starch under different treatment conditions.<br>
In a typical low temperature jet cooking experiment, 700g of distilled H2O were added to 300 g of white rice flour in a plastic beaker to make up a 30% ds rice flour slurry. The slurry was stirred and the pH adjusted to 6.0 using 6.0 N H2SO4. Alpha amylase from<br><br>
Bacillus strearothermophilus (G-zyme G997) (Genencor International Inc.) was added at a dosage of 0.8 kg/MT (w/w dss). The slurry was pumped through a heated coil at 105°C for 5 min and held in a covered Erlenmeyer flask partially submerged in a 95°C water bath for 2 hrs. Two ml of liquefact was transferred using a plastic pipette into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 min. The Brix value of the supernatant was 27.<br>
Assuming 100% solubilization of rice starch by G-Zyme G997, a Brix value of 27 represents the reference Brix and was used to calculate relative solubilization of rice starch in the examples which follow.<br>
RS   =    (Brix / Reference Brix)   X 100%<br>
where RS = relative solubilization; Brix = experimental (Expt) Brix and Reference Brix = Brix at 100% solubilization.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is described in further detail in the following examples which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Expression of Humicola grisea var. thermoidea GSHE in Trichoderma reesei (rH-GSHE).<br>
Cloning the H. grisea var. thermo/dea GSHE gene -<br>
Genomic DNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) was extracted from frozen Scytalidium thermophilum (ATCC 16453, anamorph, H. grisea var. thermoidea) mycelia. The frozen mycelia were ground with dry ice in a coffee grinder and the DNA was extracted by the EasyDNA protocol (Invitrogen). An extra chloroform/phenol/isoamyl alcohol extraction was added to the standard protocol. PCR primers were designed, based on the NCBI database accession number M89475. The forward primer contained a motif for directional cloning into the pENTR/D vector (Invitrogen).<br>
The sequence of the RSHOOS3f primer was<br>
CAACATGCATACCTTCTCCAAGCTCCTC (SEQ ID NO:8) and the sequence of the RSH004r primer was TTAACGCCACGAATCATTCA CCGTC (SEQ ID NO:9).<br>
The PCR product was cloned into pENTR/D, according to the Invitrogen Gateway system protocol. The vector was then transformed into chemically competent TopIO E.coli (Stratagene) with kanamycin selection. Plasmid DNA from several clones was restriction digested to confirm the correct size insert. The gla1insert was sequenced (Sequetech, Mountain View, CA) from several clones. Plasmid DNA from one clone, pENTR/D_N13,<br><br>
was added to the LR clonase reaction (Invitrogen Gateway system) with pTrex3g/amdS destination vector DNA. Recombination, in the LR clonase reaction,.replaced the CmR and ccdB genes of the destination vector with the H. grisea gla1 from the pENTR/D vector.<br>
This recombination was directionally inserted gla1between the cbhl promoter and terminator of the destination vector. Recombination site sequences of 48 and 50 bp remain upstream and downstream, respectively, of gla1. An aliquot of the LR clonase reaction was transformed into chemically competent TopIO E.coli and grown overnight with carbenicillin selection. Plasmid DNA from several clones was restriction digested to confirm the correct insert size. Plasmid DNA from clone, pTrex3g_N13 (Figures 3 and 4) was digested with Xba1to release the expression cassette including the cbhl promoter:gla1 :cbhland terminatoramdS. This 6.6 kb cassette was purified by agarose extraction and transformed into a strain of T. reesei derived from the publicly available strain QM6a, as further described below.<br>
The cassette was sequenced by Sequetech, Mountain View, CA and the DNA for GSHE is illustrated in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) and the polypeptide sequence is illustrated in Figure 2 (SEQ ID NOs:2 and 3).<br>
Transformation of T. reesei -<br>
Approximately one-half swab (or 1 -2 cm2) of a plate of sporulated mycelia (grown on a PDA plate for 5 days at 30°C) was inoculated into 50ml of YEG (5 g/L yeast extract plus 20 g/L glucose) broth in a 250ml, 4-baffled shake flask and incubate at 37°C for 16-20 hours at 200 rpm. The mycelia were recovered by transferring liquid volume into 50ml conical tubes and spinning at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated off. The mycelial pellet was transferred into a 250ml, 0.22 m CA Corning filter bottle containing 40ml of (β-glucanase solution and incubated at 30°C, 200rpm for 2 hours to generate protoplasts for transformation.<br>
Protoplasts were harvested by filtration through sterile miracloth into a 50ml conical tube. They were pelleted by spinning at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes and aspirated. The protoplast pellet was washed once with 50ml of 1.2M sorbitol, spun down, aspirated, and washed with 25ml of sorbitol/CaCI2. Protoplasts were counted and then pelleted at 2000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was aspirated off, and the protoplast pellet was resuspended in an amount of sorbitol/CaCI2. sufficient to generate a protoplast concentration of 1,25 x 108 protoplasts per ml, generating a protoplast solution.<br>
Aliquots of up to 20μg of expression vector DNA (in a volume no greater than 20μl) were placed into 15ml conical tubes and the tubes were put on ice. Then 200ul of protoplasts were added along with 50μl PEG solution to each transformation aliquot. The<br><br>
tubes were mixed gently and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. PEG solution (2ml) was added to the transformation aliquot tubes and these were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Sorbitol/CaCI2 (4 ml) was added to the tubes generating a total of 6.2 ml. The transformation mixture was divided into 3 aliquots each containing about 2ml. An overlay mixture was created by adding each of these three aliquots to three tubes of melted top agar (kept molten by holding at 50°C) and this overlay mixture was poured onto the transformation plates. The transformation plates were then incubated at 30°C for four to seven days.<br>
The transformation was performed with amdS selection. Acetamide/sorbitol plates and overlays were used for the transformation. For the selection plates, the same plates are used, but without sorbitol. Transformants were purified by transfer of isolated colonies to fresh selective media containing acetamide.<br>

Fermentation of T. reesei transformed with the H. grisea var. thermoidea glucoamylase gene-<br>
In general, the fermentation protocol as described in Foreman et al. (Foreman et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem 278:31988-31997) was followed. More specifically, duplicate fermentations were run for each of the strains. 0.8 L of Vogels minimal media (Davis et al., (1970) Methods in Enzymology 17A, pg 79 - 143 and Davis, Rowland, Neurospora,<br><br>
Contributions-ofa Model-Organism, Oxford University Press2OOO)) containing 5% glucose was inoculated with 1.5 ml frozen spore suspension. After 48 hours, each culture was transferred to 6.2L of the same medium in a 14L Biolafitte fermenter. The fermenter was run at 25°C, 750 RPM and 8 standard liters per minute airflow. One hour after the initial glucose was exhausted, a 25% (w/w) lactose feed was started and fed in a carbon limiting fashion to prevent lactose accumulation. The concentrations of glucose and of lactose were monitored using a glucose oxidase assay kit or a glucose hexokinase assay kit with beta-galactosidase added to cleave lactose, respectively (Instrumentation Laboratory Co., Lexington, MA). Samples were obtained at regular intervals to monitor the progress of the fermentation. Collected samples were spun in a 50ml centrifuge tube at 3/4 speed in an Internal Equipment Company (Needham Heights, MA) clinical centrifuge.<br>
Sample supernatants were run of 4 - 12% Bis-Tris SDS PAGE gels, under reducing conditions with MOPS (morpholinepropane sulfonic acid) SDS running buffer and LDS sample buffer. A 68kD rGSHE band (data not shown) was observed at different time . periods.<br>
Assay of GSHE Activity from Transformed Trichoderma reesei Clones -<br>
Enzyme activity - GSHE activity was determined as milligrams (mg) of reducing sugars released (measured as glucose equivalent) per minute (min) during an incubation of 5 ml of 10% granular cornstarch in a 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 50°C with an aliquot of the enzyme preparation.<br>
Native GSHE (nGSHE) from Humicola grisea var. thermoidea and recombinant Humicola grisea var. thermoidea rGSHE produced from T. reesei were purified by standard techniques using hydrophobic interaction chromatography using phenyl-sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) followed by ion exchange chromatography using SP-sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The recombinant GSHE initially expressed by T. reesei clones included two protein peak fractions in about equal concentrations. These peaks were labeled rGSHE1 and rGSHE2. The two peaks differed in mass by 1500D and by 0.3 pH units as measured by matrix assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI-TOF) on a Voyageur mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an isoelectric focusing gel (SERVA Electrophoresis, GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) according to manufacturer directions. Both rGSHEl and rGSHE2 have the same specific activity as measured by the raw starch hydrolyzing assay and protein measurements using a MicroBCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockland, IL) and the percent solution extinction coefficient (A280 0.1% = 1.963). After a<br><br>
period of time, measured at approximately 72 hours after initial rGSHE expression, only one form of rGSHE is represented (rGSHE3). Reference is made to Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)The % carbohydrate (CHO) of the GSHEs was determined by acid hydrolysis using 4N trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 5 hrs and measurements were made of the released reducing sugars using parahydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide. When initially expressed, the glycosylation of rGSHE! and rGSHE2 was 2.70% of the total carbohydrate. However after 72 hours the level of glycosylation of rGSHES found in the medium was 0.57% total CHO. The level of glycosylation of native GSHE is 1.12%.<br>
The rGSHE obtained according to this example was used as a source of the recombinant GSHE in the following examples and is referred to as rH-GSHE.<br>
Expression of the Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi GSHE in Trichoderma reesei -<br>
Cloning the Aspergillus awamori var. kawachi GSHE gene which encodes the mature amino acid sequence as depicted in Figure 6 and transformation and transformation into Trichoderma reesei was accomplished in the same manner as described above.<br>
Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from frozen mycelia of a strain of A. awamori var. kawachi according to the methods described above. The primer sequences were designed based on the published sequence of the A. awamori var. kawachi glucoamylase (GAI) (Hayashida et al (1989) Agric. Biol. Chem. 53:923-929). The following primers were used:<br>
the RSHIOf primer having the sequence CACCATGTCGTTCCGATCTCTTCTC (SEQ ID NO. 10),<br>
which includes the Gateway (Invitrogen) directional cloning motif CACC and the RSH11 r primer having the sequence<br>
CTACCGCCAGGTGTCGGTCAC (SEQ ID NO. 11).<br>
The DMA sequence is provided in Figure 5 (SEQ ID NO: 5). Vector construction and transformation of T. reesei proceeded as described above. The A-GSHE insert was<br><br>
sequehced by Sequetech Corp. (Mountain View, CA). Expression of rA-GSHE was determined as described above for expression of rH-GSHE. The level of expression was determined to be greater than 2g/L<br>

Solubilization of granular rice starch bv alpha amvlases.<br>
In a 1000 ml stainless steel container, 350 g dH2O was added to 15O g white rice flour to make up a 30% ds rice flour slurry. The slurry was stirred and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 using 6N H2SO4. A stainless steel stirrer was placed into the container and a glass cover was placed on top. Before enzymes were added to the container, the container was placed in a 70°C water bath for 15 min. Alpha amylase from Bacillus strearothermophilus (G-zyme G997 from Genencor International, Inc) was compared to alpha arnylase from Bacillus licheniformis (SPEZYME FRED from Genencor International, Inc) on the ability to solublize granular rice starch added at a dosage of 0.8 kg/MT (w/w dss). After enzyme addition, the suspensions were incubated with stirring at 70°C for 2 hrs followed by 60°C for 48 hrs. A 2 ml sample was taken from each container at a predetermined time interval using a plastic pipette and transferred to a centrifuge tube. The sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 mins. The supernatant was withdrawn from the centrifuge tube and a few drops were placed into a sample well of Lecia AR200 digital hand held refractometer. The Brix value was recorded and the relative solubilization (RS) was calculated.  The results as depicted in Table 2 demonstrate that alpha amylase B. strearothermophilus (G-zyme G997) is more effective in solubilizing granular rice starch than alpha amylase from B. iicheniformis (SPEZYME FRED).<br>

The suspension was stirred and the pH was adjusted to pH 5.5 using 6N H2SO4. A stainless steel stirrer was placed into the container and a glass covered placed on top. The steel container with the suspension was placed into a 60°C water bath for 15 min before the alpha amylase was added. Three containers of suspension as described above were prepared. G-zyme G997 was added into each container at a dosage of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 kg/MT rice flour (ds). After enzyme addition, the suspensions were incubated at 60°C for 24 hours with stirring. A 2 ml sample was taken from each container at a pre-determined interval using a plastic pipette and transferred to a centrifuge tube. The samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 3 min. A few drops of'supernatant were then carefully withdrawn from the tube and the Brix was measured. The Brix value was recorded and the relative solubilization (RS) was calculated. The results, as depicted in Table 3 show no significant difference in the relative solubilization of granular rice starch when the dosage of G-zyme G997 is increased above 0.25 kg/MT rice flour (ds).<br>

Distilled H2O (350g) was added to 150 g of white rice flour in a 1000 ml stainless steel container to make up a 30% ds rice flour suspension. The suspension was stirred and the pH adjusted to 5.5 using 6N H2SO4. A stainless steel stirrerwas placed in the container and a glass cover was placed on top of the contained. The steel container containing the suspension was placed into a 60°C water bath for 15 min before the enzymes were added.<br>
Two containers of the suspension as described above were prepared. G-Zyme G997 was added to each container at a dosage of 0.1 kg/MT rice flour (ds) and rH-GSHE was added at a dosage of 0 and 1.0 GSHE units/g rice flour ds. After the enzyme addition, the suspensions were incubated at 60°C for 24 hours with stirring. A 2 ml sample was taken from each container at a pre-determined interval using a plastic pipette and transferred to a centrifuge tube. The tube with the sample was centrif uged at 8000 rpm for 3 min. A few drops of the supernatant were carefully withdrawn from the centrifuge tube and the Brix was measured. The Brix value was recorded and the relative Solubilization (RS) was calculated. Another 0.5 ml supernatant was transferred to a test tube equipped with a screw cap. The tube was capped and placed into a boiling water bath for 15 minutes to inactivate the enzymes. The supernatant was diluted with distilled H2O so that the Brix was approximately 3. Each tube was mixed well and 2 ml of the contents were filtered through a 0.45 urn filter into an autosampler vial. Sugar profile of the supernatants was analyzed using HPLC.<br>
The results as depicted in Tables 5 and 6 demonstrate that rH-GSHE significantly increases the solubilization of granular rice starch to over 90% after only 24 hours in the presence of 0.1 kg/MT dss G-Zyme G997. Reference is also made to Figure 7, wherein the % solublized starch over time is compared for G-Zyme G997 alone, rH-GSHE alone and rH-GSHE and G-Zyme-G997 in combination. It is observed that after 20 hours over 90% of the granular starch is solublized when both rH-GSHE and G-Zyme-G997 are combined as compared to about 50% when G-Zyme G997 is used alone and about 28% when rH-GSHE is used alone. Additionally, rH-GSHE with G-Zyme G997 was able to produce a syrup with over 96% glucose after only 24 hours. However, the G-Zyme G997, alone, was neither able to solublize over 90% of the granular rice starch nor produce high glucose syrup.<br>

Distilled H2O (700g) was added to 300 g of white rice flour (Elephant brand, Thai Better Foods, Co. Ltd., Bangpong, Thailand) in a 1000 ml stainless steel container to make up a 30% ds rice flour slurry. The pH of the slurry was adjusted to pH 5.5 using 6N H2SO4. The slurry was placed into a 60°C water bath and stirred continuously for uniform mixing before enzymes were added. rH-GSHE was added at a dosage rate of 1.0 GSHE Units/g rice flour, ds and G-Zyme G997 was added at a dosage of 0.1 kg/MT rice flour ds. After enzyme addition, the suspensions were incubated at 60°C for 24 hours with stirring (until more than 99% of the granular rice was solubilized).<br>
Solubilization of rice starch at a pH of the minimum solubility of rice protein (pH 3.0 - 5.5) facilitated the separation of insoluble rice protein from solublized rice starch. After completion of the hydrolysis of rice starch, the incubated slurry was filtered using a Buchner funnel on Whatman No. 1 filter paper to obtain a wet cake. A small portion of the wet cake was washed several times with dH2O and dried at 60°C (single treatment). The remaining wet cake was reslurried in 300g dH2O and incubated at 60°C for an additional 12 hrs with G-Zyme G997 (0.1 kg/MT rice flour) and rH-GSHE (1.0 GSHE Units/g rice flour). The pH of the slurry was adjusted at 60°C to pH 3.5 using 6N H2SO4 to terminate the enzyme reaction. Using a Buchner funnel for filtering with Whatman filter paper, the insoluble rice protein was separated. The cake was washed with dH2O to remove any solubilized starch. The rice protein concentrate was dried at 60°C until the moisture content was reduced to less than 5.0% (double treatment).-<br>
The proximate composition of the rice protein was determined and is given in Table 12. The protein concentrate from the high temperature jet cooking process was obtained as follows: SPEZYME FRED (Genencor International Inc.) (0.1kg/MT rice flour) was added to a 30% aqueous slurry of rice substrate, pH 5.5. The slurry was passed through a jet cooker maintained at 105°C (holding for 8 min) and then flashed to atmospheric pressure. The liquefaction was continued for another 90 min at 95°C. The pH of the liquefied starch was adjusted to pH 4.2 and the temperature was decreased to 60°C. OPTIMAX 4060 VHP (a glucoamylase and pullulanase blend from Genencor International Inc.) was added at 0.4 kg/MT of rice substrate and incubated for 48 hours and washed at least twice. The solubles were separated by centrifugation as described above to obtain a cake comprising an insoluble protein residue. The protein residue was washed with dH2O and dried at 60°C.<br>
