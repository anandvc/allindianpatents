RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provision Patent Application<br>
Nos. 60/431,901, filed December 9, 2002, and 60/847, filed December 19, 2002, each of<br>
which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of methods and systems for optimization of<br>
refrigeration system operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In large industrial scale systems, efficiency may be a critical aspect of operations. Even<br>
small improvement of system efficiency can lead to significant cost savings; likewise, loss of<br>
efficiency may lead to increased costs or even system failure. Chillers represent a significant<br>
type of industrial system, since they are energy intensive to operate, and are subject to variation<br>
of a number of parameters which influence system efficiency and capacity.<br>
The vast majority of mechanical refrigeration systems operate according to similar, well<br>
known principles, employing a closed-loop fluid circuit through which refrigerant flows, with a<br>
source of mechanical energy, typically a compressor, providing the motive forces for pumping<br>
heat from an evaporator to a condenser. In a chiller, water or brine is cooled in the evaporator<br>
for use in a process. In a common type of system, discussed in more detail below, the evaporator<br>
is formed as a set of parallel tubes, forming a tube bundle, within a housing. The tubes end on<br>
either side in a separator plate. The water or brine flows through the tubes, and the refrigerant is<br>
separately provided on the outside of the tubes, within the housing.<br>
The condenser receives hot refrigerant gas from the compressor, where it is cooled. The<br>
condenser may also have tubes, which are, for example, filled with water which flows to a<br>
cooling tower. The cooled refrigerant condenses as a liquid, and flows by gravity to the bottom<br>
of the condenser, where it is fed through a valve or orifice to the evaporator.<br>
The compressor therefore provides the motive force for active heat pumping from the<br>
evaporator to the condenser. The compressor typically requires a lubricant, in order to provide<br>
extended life and permit operation with close mechanical tolerances. The lubricant is an oil<br>
which miscible with the refrigerant. Thus, an oil sump is provided to feed oil to the compressor,<br>
and a separator is provided after the compressor to capture and recycle the oil. Normally, the<br>
gaseous refrigerant and liquid lubricant are separated by gravity, so that the condenser remains<br>
relatively oil free. However, over time, lubricating oil migrates out of the compressor and its<br>
lubricating oil recycling system, into the condenser. Once in the condenser, the lubricating oil<br>
becomes mixed with the liquefied refrigerant and is carried to the evaporator. Since the<br>
evaporator evaporates the refrigerant, the lubricating oil accumulates at the bottom of the<br>
evaporator.<br>
The oil in the evaporator tends to bubble, and forms a film on the walls of the evaporator<br>
tubes, In some cases, such as fin tube evaporators, a small amount of oil enhances heat transfer<br>
and is therefore beneficial. In other cases, such as nucleation boiling evaporator tubes, the<br>
presence of oil, for example over 1%, results in reduced heat transfer. See, Schlager, L.M., Pate,<br>
M.B., and Berges, A.E., "A Comparison of 150 and 300 SUS Oil Effects on Refrigerant<br>
Evaporation and Condensation in a Smooth Tube and Micro-fin Tube", ASHRAE Trans. 1989,<br>
95(l):387-97; Thome, J.R., "Comprehensive Thermodynamic Approach to Modelling<br>
Refrigerant-Lubricating Oil Mixtures", Intl. J. HVAC&amp;R Research (ASHRAE) 1995, 110-126;<br>
Poz, M. Y., "Heat Exchanger Analysis for Nonazeotropic Refrigerant Mixtures", ASHRAE<br>
Trans. 1994, 10Q(1)727:735 (Paper No. 95-5-1).<br>
A refrigeration system is typically controlled at a system level in one of two ways: by<br>
regulating the temperature of the gas phase in the top of the evaporator (the superheat), or by<br>
seeking to regulate the amount of liquid (liquid level) within the evaporator. As the load on the<br>
system increases, the equilibrium within the evaporator changes. Higher heat load will increase<br>
temperatures in the headspace. Likewise, higher load will boil more refrigerant per unit time,<br>
and lead to lower liquid levels.<br>
For example, US 6,318,101, expressly incorporated herein by reference, relates to a<br>
method for controlling an electric expansion valve based on cooler pinch and discharge<br>
superheat. This system seeks to infer the level of refrigerant in the evaporator and control the<br>
system based thereon, while preventing liquid slugging. A controlled monitors certain variables<br>
which are allegedly used to determine the optimal position of the electronic expansion valve, to<br>
optimize system performance, the proper discharge superheat value, and the appropriate<br>
refrigerant charge. Sec also, US Patent No. 6,141,980, expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
US Patent No. 5,782,131, expressly incorporated herein by reference, relates to a<br>
refrigeration system having a flooded cooler with a liquid level sensor.<br>
Each of these strategies provides a single fixed setpoint which is presumed to be the<br>
normal and desired setpoint for operation. Based on this control variable, one or more<br>
parameters of operation are varied. Typically, a compressor will either have a variable speed<br>
drive or a set of variable angle vanes which deflect gaseous refrigerant from the evaporator to the<br>
compressor. These modulate the compressor output. Additionally, some designs have a<br>
controllable expansion valve between the condenser and evaporator. Since there is a single main<br>
control variable, the remaining elements are controlled together as an inner loop to maintain the<br>
control variable at the setpoint.<br>
Typical refrigerants are substances that have a boiling point (at the operating pressure)<br>
below the desired cooling temperature, and therefore absorb heat from the environment while<br>
evaporating (changing phase) under operational conditions. Thus, the evaporator environment is<br>
cooled, while heat is transferred to another location, the condenser, where the latent heat of<br>
vaporization is shed. Refrigerants thus absorb heat via evaporation from one area and reject it via<br>
condensation into another area. In many types of systems, a desirable refrigerant provides an<br>
evaporator pressure as high as possible and, simultaneously, a condenser pressure as low as<br>
possible. High evaporator pressures imply high vapor densities, and thus a greater system heat<br>
transfer capacity for a given compressor. However, the efficiency at the higher pressures is<br>
lower, especially as the condenser pressure approaches the critical pressure of the refrigerant.<br>
The overall efficiency of the refrigeration system is influenced by the heat transfer<br>
coefficients of the respective heat exchangers. Higher thermal impedance results in lower<br>
efficiency, since temperature equilibration is impaired, and a larger temperature differential must<br>
be maintained to achieve the same heat transfer. The heat transfer impedance generally increases<br>
as a result of deposits on the walls of the heat exchangers, although, in some cases, heat transfer<br>
may be improved by various surface treatments and/or an oil film.<br>
Refrigerants must satisfy a number of other requirements as best as possible including:<br>
compatibility with compressor lubricants and the materials of construction of refrigerating<br>
equipment, toxicity, environmental effects, cost availability, and safety. The fluid refrigerants<br>
commonly used today typically include halogenated and partially halogenated alkanes, including<br>
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCFs), and less commonly<br>
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). A number of other refrigerants are<br>
known, including propane and fluorocarbon ethers. Some common refrigerants are identified as<br>
R11, R12, R22, R500, and R502, each refrigerant having characteristics that make them suitable<br>
for different types of applications.<br>
In an industrial chiller, the evaporator heat exchanger is a large structure, containing a<br>
plurality of parallel tubes in a bundle, within a larger vessel comprising a shell. The liquid<br>
refrigerant and oil form a pool in the bottom of the evaporator, boiling and cooling the tubes and<br>
their contents. Inside the tubes, an aqueous medium, such as brine, circulates and is cooled,<br>
which is then pumped to another region where the brine cools the industrial process. Such an<br>
evaporator may hold hundreds or thousands of gallons of aqueous medium with an even larger<br>
circulating volume. Since evaporation of the refrigerant is a necessary part of the process, the<br>
liquid refrigerant and oil must fill only part of the evaporator.<br>
It is also known to periodically purge a refrigeration or chiller system, recycling purified<br>
refrigerant through the system to clean the system. This technique, however, generally permits<br>
rather large variance in system efficiency and incurs relatively high maintenance costs. Further,<br>
this technique generally does not acknowledge that there is an optimum (non-zero) level of oil in<br>
the evaporator and, for example, the condenser. Thus, typical maintenance seeks to produce a<br>
"clean" system, which may be suboptimal, subject to incremental changes after servicing.<br>
Refrigerant from a refrigeration system may be reclaimed or recycled to separate oil and provide<br>
clean refrigerant, in a manual process that requires system shutdown.<br>
US patent No. 6,260,378, expressly incorporated herein by reference, relates to a<br>
refrigerant purge system, in particular to control removal of non-condensable gases.<br>
The oil in the evaporator tends to accumulate, since the basic design has no inherent path<br>
for returning the oil to the sump. For amounts in excess of the optimum, there are generally<br>
reduced system efficiencies resulting from increasing oil concentration in the evaporator. Thus,<br>
buildup of large quantities of refrigerant oil within an evaporator will reduce efficiency of the<br>
system.<br>
In-line devices may be provided to continuously remove refrigerant oil from the<br>
refrigerant entering the evaporator. These devices include so-called oil eductors, which remove<br>
oil and refrigerant from the evaporator, returning the oil to the sump and evaporated refrigerant<br>
to the compressor. The inefficiency of these continuous removal devices is typically as a result<br>
of the bypassing of the evaporator by a portion of the refrigerant, and potentially a heat source to<br>
vaporize or partially distill the refrigerant to separate the oil. Therefore, only a small proportion<br>
of the refrigerant leaving the condenser may be subjected to this process, resulting in poor<br>
control of oil level in the evaporator and efficiency loss. There is no adequate system for<br>
controlling the eductor. Rather, the eductor may be relatively undersize and run continuously.<br>
An oversize eductor would be relatively inefficient, since the heat of vaporization is not<br>
efficiently used in the process.<br>
Another way to remove oil from the evaporator is to provide a shunt for a portion of<br>
mixed liquid refrigerant and oil in the evaporator to the compressor, wherein the oil is subject to<br>
the normal recycling mechanisms. This shunt, however, may be inefficient and is difficult to<br>
control. Further, it is difficult to achieve and maintain low oil concentrations using this method.<br>
US Patent No. 6,233,967, expressly incorporated herein by reference, relates to a<br>
refrigeration chiller oil recovery system which employs high pressure oil as an eductor motive<br>
fluid. See also, US Patent Nos. 6,170,286 and 5,761,914, expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
In both the eductor and shunt, as the oil level reaches low levels, e.g., about 1%, 99% of<br>
the fluid being separate is refrigerant, leading to significant loss of process efficiency.<br>
It is noted that it is difficult to accurately sample and determine the oil concentration in<br>
the evaporator. As the refrigerant boils, oil concentration increases. Therefore, the oil<br>
concentration near the top of the refrigerant is higher than the bulk. However, as the boiling<br>
liquid churns, inhomogeneities occur, and accurate sampling becomes difficult or impossible.<br>
Further, it is not clear that the average bulk oil concentration is a meaningful control variable,<br>
apart from the effects of the oil on the various components. Since it is difficult to measure the<br>
oil concentration, it is also difficult to measure the amount of refrigerant in the evaporator. A<br>
difficulty of measurement of the amount of refrigerant is compounded by the fact that, during<br>
operation, the evaporator is boiling and froths; measuring the amount during a system shutdown<br>
must account for any change in distribution of the refrigerant between the other system<br>
components.<br>
It is known that the charge conditions of a chiller may have a substantial effect on both<br>
system capacity and system operating efficiency. Obviously, if the amount of liquid refrigerant<br>
in the evaporator is insufficient, the system cannot meet its cooling needs, and this limits<br>
capacity. Thus, in order to handle a larger heat load, a greater quantity of refrigerant, at least in<br>
the evaporator, is required. However, in typical designs, by providing this large refrigerant<br>
charge, the operating efficiency of the system at reduced loads is reduced, thus requiring more<br>
energy for the same BTU cooling. Bailey, Margaret B., "System Performance Characteristics of<br>
a Helical Rotary Screw Air-Cooled Chiller Operating Over a Range of Refrigerant Charge<br>
Conditions", ASHRAE Trans. 1998 104(2), expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Therefore, by correctly selecting the "size" (e.g., cooling capacity) of the chiller, efficiency is<br>
enhanced. Typically the chiller capacity is determined by the maximum expected design load,<br>
and thus for any given design load, the quantity of refrigerant charge in a typical design is<br>
dictated. Therefore, in order to achieve improved system efficiency, a technique of modulation<br>
recruitment is employed, in which one or more of a plurality of subsystems are selectively<br>
activated depending on the load, to allow efficient design of each subsystem while permitting a<br>
high overall system load capacity with all subsystems operational. See, Trane "Engineer's<br>
Newsletter" December 1996, 25(5): 1-5. Another known technique seeks to alter the rotational<br>
speed of the compressor. See, U.S. Patent No. 5,651,264, expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference. It is also possible to control compressor speed using an electronic motor control, or<br>
system capacity, by restricting refrigerant flow into the compressor.<br>
Chiller efficiency generally increases with chiller load. Thus, an optimal system seeks to<br>
operate system near its rated design. Higher refrigerant charge level than the nominal full level,<br>
however, results in deceased efficiency. Further, chiller load capacity sets a limit on the<br>
minimum refrigerant charge level. Therefore, it is seen that there exists an optimum refrigerant<br>
charge level for maximum efficiency. As stated above, as oil level increases in the evaporator, it<br>
both displaces refrigerant and has an independent effect on system efficiency.<br>
Systems are available for measuring the efficiency of a chiller, i.e., a refrigeration system<br>
which cools water or a water solution, such as brine. In these systems, the efficiency is<br>
calculated based on Watt-hours of energy consumed (Volts x Amps x hours) per cooling unit,<br>
typically tons or British Thermal Unit (BTU) (the amount of energy required to change the<br>
temperature of one British ton of water 1° C). Thus, a minimal measurement of efficiency<br>
requires a power meter (timebase, voltmeter, ammeter), and thermometers and flowmeters for<br>
the inlet and outlet water. Typically, further instruments are provided, including a chiller water<br>
pressure gage, gages for the pressure and temperature of evaporator and condenser. A data<br>
acquisition system processor is also typically provided to calculate the efficiency, in BTU/kWH.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for optimizing operation of a<br>
refrigeration system.<br>
 In most known refrigeration systems, control is exerted principally to assure that liquid<br>
refrigerant is not returned to the compressor, and otherwise to assure that the level of refrigerant<br>
in the evaporator is presumed to be at a predetermined set level.<br>
According to the present the optimum level of refrigerant arid oil in the -<br>
evaporator is not predetermined] The problem of the prior art is that, over time, the system<br>
characteristics may change, as well as the load characteristics, and that an optimal control<br>
requires more complexity. simularly direct measurements of the effective<br>
levels of relevant parameters may not be measurable, and thus surrogates may be provided. Thus<br>
According to the present invention, a pair of control loops, an inner loop and an outer<br>
loop, are provided. The inner loop controls the compressor, than is, the motive force for<br>
pumping heat. This inner control loop receives a single input from the outer loop, and optimizes<br>
the compressor operation in accordance therewith, for example compressor speed, duty cycle,<br>
inlet vane position, and the like. If present, a controllable expansion valve (typically located<br>
between the condenser and evaporator) is also encompassed within this inner control loop.<br>
Thus, the inner control loop controls the rate of supply of liquid refrigerant to the evaporator.<br>
The outer control loop controls the partitioning of refrigerant between the evaporator and<br>
a refrigerant accumulator element within the system. The accumulator is typically not a<br>
"functional" system element, in that the amount of refrigerant in the accumulator is not critical,<br>
simply that this element allows a variation in the amount of refrigerant elsewhere in the system.<br>
The accumulator may be a lower portion of the condenser, a separate accumulator, or even a<br>
reserve portion of the evaporator which does not significantly particulate in the cooling process. During steady state operation, the feed of liquid refrigerant from the condenser will equal<br>
the rate of gaseous intake to the compressor. Thus, the rate of heat absorption in the evaporator<br>
will effectively control the inner control loop for the compressor. Typically, this heat absorption<br>
may be measured or estimated from a variety of system sensors, including evaporator discharge<br>
temperature and pressure, evaporator water/brine inlet and outlet temperature and pressure, and<br>
possibly condenser headspace temperature and pressure.<br>
The outer control loop determines an optimal level of refrigerant in the evaporator. A<br>
direct measurement of refrigerant level in the evaporator is difficult for two reasons: First, the<br>
evaporator is filled with refrigerant and oil, and a direct sampling of the evaporator contents,<br>
such as by using an optical sensor for oil concentration, does not typically yield useful results<br>
during system operation. During system shutdown, the oil concentration may be accurately<br>
measured, but such shutdown conditions typically allow a repartitioning of refrigerant within the<br>
various system components. Second, during operation, the refrigerant and oil bubble and froth,<br>
and therefore there is no simple level to be determined. Rather a preferred method for inferring<br>
the amount of refrigerant in the evaporator, especially changes over a relatively short period of<br>
time, is to monitor the level of refrigerant in the accumulator, which is preferably a lower portion<br>
of the condenser or associated with the condenser. Since this refrigerant is relatively pure, and<br>
held under condensing conditions, the level is relatively easy to measure. Since the remaining<br>
system components include principally refrigerant gas, a measurement of the condenser or<br>
accumulator refrigerant level will provide useful information for measuring changes in<br>
evaporator refrigerant level. If the starting levels of both the accumulator or condenser and<br>
evaporator are known (even during a shutdown state), than an absolute measurement may be<br>
calculated.<br>
Of course, there are other means for measuring or calculating the amount of refrigerant in<br>
the evaporator, and broad embodiments of the invention are not limited to the preferred method<br>
of measurement.<br>
The present invention provides, however, that there is a partitioning of refrigerant, with<br>
variable control over the amount within the evaporator. The outer loop controls this level to<br>
achieve an optimum state.<br>
In a refrigeration system, efficiency is calculated in terms of energy per unit heat transfer.<br>
Energy may be supplied as electricity, gas, coal, steam, or other source, and may be directly<br>
measured. Surrogate measurements may also be employed, as known in the art. Heat transfer<br>
may also be calculated in known manner. For example, the heat transfer to the cooled process<br>
water is calculated by measuring or estimating the flow rate and the inlet and outlet<br>
temperatures.<br>
While it is possible to map the control algorithm in terms of desired partitioning of<br>
refrigerant under a variety of load circumstances, a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
provides an adaptive control. This adaptive control determines, during system transients, which<br>
may be normally occurring or induced, the charge in system efficiency with changes in<br>
refrigerant partitioning at a given operating point. For example, if the process changes, requiring<br>
a different heat load dissipation, this will be represented by a change in inlet water temperature<br>
and/or flow rate. This change will result in a different rate of refrigerant evaporation in the<br>
evaporator, and thus a transient change in partitioning. Before or in conjunction with correcting<br>
the refrigerant partitioning, the control monitors the system efficiency. This monitoring allows<br>
the control to develop a system model, which then allows it to anticipate an optimum control<br>
surface. The outer loop repartitions the refrigerant to achieve optimum efficiency. It is noted<br>
that, while efficiency is typically considered to be kW/ton, other measurements of efficiency may<br>
be substituted without materially altering the control strategy. For example, instead of<br>
optimizing the refrigeration system itself, the industrial process may be included. In this case,<br>
the production parameters or economics of the process may be calculated, to provide a more<br>
global optimization.<br>
In a global optimization, other systems may also require control or serve as inputs. These<br>
may be accommodated in known manner.<br>
Over time, oil migrates from the oil sump of the compressor to the evaporator. One<br>
aspect of the invention provides a control system which measures oil consumption, in order to<br>
estimate oil level in the evaporator. This control system therefore measures oil replenishment<br>
into the sump, oil return from the outlet of the compressor, and oil return from the eductor. It is<br>
noted that the oil in the sump may be mixed with refrigerant, and therefore a simple level gage<br>
will likely require compensation, such as by boiling a sample of oil to remove refrigerant, or by<br>
using an oil concentration sensor, such as an optical type sensor. Thus, it is possible to estimate<br>
the amount of oil migration into the evaporator, and with a known starting state or clean system,<br>
to estimate a total amount of oil. Using measurements of evaporator discharge temperature and<br>
pressure, as well as water inlet and outlet temperature and pressure, it is further possible to<br>
estimate heat transfer coefficients in the tube bundle, and impairments thereof. The refrigerant,<br>
oil and heat transfer impairments arc the principle internal variables which control the efficiency<br>
of the evaporator. Over the short term (and assuming that oil is not intentionally added to the<br>
evaporator), refrigerant is the only effective and available control variable. Over longer periods,<br>
an oil eductor may be controlled based on inferred or measured oil concentration to return the oil<br>
level in the evaporator to an optimal level. Over extended intervals, maintenance may be<br>
performed to correct heat transfer impairments and purify the refrigerant. Such maintenance<br>
requirements may be indicated as an output from the control system. For example, the control<br>
system operates automatically to immediately tune the control variable to an optimum'state.<br>
This tuning is triggered by a change in process conditions or some adaptive auto-tuning process.<br>
In addition, overtime, the optimization control surface will vary. As this surface varies to reduce<br>
overall efficiency, secondary correction controls may be invoked, such as oil eductor, non-<br>
condensable gas purge (typically from the condenser), or the like. Over a longer term, the<br>
control may model significant parameters of system operation with respect to a model, and<br>
determine when a service is required, either because the system is failing, or substantial<br>
inefficiencies are apparent, such as impaired heat transfer through the tube bundle.<br>
As stated above, the inner control loop is generally insulated from direct response to<br>
changes in process. Further, since the evaporator is generally outside of the inner control loop,<br>
this control loop generally does not suffer adverse changes over time, except buildup of non-<br>
condensable gasses in the condenser, which are relatively easy to infer based on a superheat<br>
value, and relatively easy to purge. Thus, the inner control loop may typically operate according<br>
to a predetermined control strategy, and need not be adaptive. This, in turn, allows multivariate<br>
control, for example, motor speed, inlet vane position, and expansion valve control, to be<br>
effected based on a static system model, to achieve optimal efficiency under a variety of<br>
conditions.<br>
On the other hand, the outer control loop seeks to control the short term system response<br>
principally based on an optimization of a single variable, refrigerant partitioning, with variations<br>
in system load. While a static system model is difficult or impossible to implement, while<br>
achieving the required accuracy, such a control is readily implemented in an adaptive fashion, to<br>
compensate for changes in the system, and indeed, over a period of time, to correct deviations in<br>
system parameters which adversely effect system efficiency.<br>
It is, of course, apparent that these control loops and their algorithmic implementation<br>
may be merged, and indeed hybridized, the general strategy remains the same. At any operating<br>
point, the partitioning of refrigerant is controlled to achieve a maximum efficiency. The system<br>
senses or tests efficiency as a function of the control variable, in order to compensate for changes<br>
in system response.<br>
A more detailed analysis of the basis for refrigerant partitioning as a control strategy is<br>
provided. Chiller efficiency depends on several factors, including subcooling temperature and<br>
condensing pressure, which, in turn, depend on the level of refrigerant charge, nominal chiller<br>
load, and the outdoor air temperature. First, subcooling within the thermodynamic cycle will be<br>
examined. Fig. 6A shows a vapor compression cycle schematic and Fig. 6B shows an actual<br>
temperature-entropy diagram, wherein the dashed line indicates an ideal cycle. Upon exiting the<br>
compressor at state 2, as indicated in Fig 6A, a high-pressure mixture of hot gas and oil passes<br>
through an oil separator before entering the tubes of the remote air-cooled condenser where the<br>
refrigerant rejects heat (Qh) to moving air by forced convection (or other cooling medium). In<br>
the last several rows of condenser coils, the high-pressure saturated liquid refrigerant should be<br>
subcooled, e.g., 10F to 20F (5.6C to 11.1 C), according to manufacturer's recommendations, as<br>
shown by state 3 in Fig. 6B. This level of subcooling allows the device following the condenser,<br>
the electronic expansion valve, to operate properly. In addition, the level of subcooling has a<br>
direct relationship with chiller capacity. A reduced level of subcooling results in a shift of state 3<br>
(in Fig. 6B) to the right and a corresponding shift of state 4 to the right, thereby reducing the heat<br>
removal capacity of the evaporator (Q1).<br>
As the chiller's refrigerant charge increases, the accumulation of refrigerant stored in the<br>
condenser on the high-pressure side of the system also increases. An increase in the amount of<br>
refrigerant in the condenser also occurs as the load on the chiller decreases due to less refrigerant<br>
flow through the evaporator, which results in increased storage (accumulation) in the condenser.<br>
A flooded condenser causes an increase in the amount of sensible heat transfer area used for<br>
subcooling, and a corresponding decrease in the surface area used for latent or isothermal heat<br>
transfer associated with condensing. Therefore, increasing refrigerant charge level and<br>
decreasing chiller load both result in increased subcooling temperatures and condensing<br>
temperatures.<br>
According to the present invention, therefore, the condenser or accumulator are provided<br>
to reduce any inefficiency resulting from variable storage of the refrigerant. This can be<br>
achieved by a static mechanical configuration, or a controlled variable configuration.<br>
Increased outdoor air or other heat sink (condenser heat rejection medium) temperatures<br>
have an opposite effect on the operation of the condenser. As the heat sink temperature<br>
increases, more condenser surface area is used for latent or isothermal heat transfer associated<br>
with condensing and a corresponding decrease in sensible heat transfer area used for subcooling.<br>
Therefore, increases in heat sink temperature result in decreased subcooling temperatures and<br>
increased condensing temperatures.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6B, an increase in subcooling drives state 3 to the left, while an increase<br>
in condensing temperature shifts the curve connecting states 2 and 3 upward. High condensing<br>
temperatures can ultimately lead to compressor motor overload and increased compressor power<br>
consumption or lowered efficiency. As subcooling increases, heat is added to the evaporator,<br>
resulting in an upward shift of the curve connecting states 4 and 1. As the evaporating<br>
temperature increases, the specific volume of the refrigerant entering the compressor also<br>
increases, resulting in increased power input to the compressor. Therefore, increased levels of<br>
refrigerant charge and decreased chiller load conditions result in increased subcooling, which<br>
leads to increased compressor power input.<br>
Superheat level is represented by the slight increase in temperature after the refrigerant<br>
leaves the saturation curve, as shown at state 1 in Fig. 6B. Vaporized refrigerant leaves the<br>
chiller's evaporator and enters the compressor as a superheated vapor. According to the present<br>
invention, the amount of superheat is not constant, and may vary based on operating conditions<br>
to achieve efficiency. In some systems, it is preferred that a minimum superheat be provided,<br>
e.g., 2.2C, to avoid premature failure from droplet pitting and erosion, or liquid slugging.<br>
However, any amount of superheat generally represents an inefficiency. According to the<br>
present invention, the "cost" of low superheat levels may optionally be included in the<br>
optimization, in order to account for this factor. Otherwise, systems may be provided to reduce<br>
or control such problems, allowing low operating superheat levels.<br>
Superheat level in the condenser may be increased, for example, by an accumulation of<br>
non-condensable gasses, which cause thermodynamic inefficiency. Therefore, according to one<br>
aspect of the invention, superheat level is monitored, and if it increases beyond a desired level, a<br>
non-condensable gas purge cycle, or other refrigerant purification, may be conducted. Non-<br>
condensable gases may be removed, for example, by extracting a gas phase from the condenser,<br>
and subjecting it to significant sub-cooling. The head-space of this sample will be principally<br>
non-condensing gasses, while refrigerant in the sample will liquefy. The liquefied refrigerant<br>
may be returned to the condenser or fed to the evaporator.<br>
As discussed previously, an increase in heat sink temperature causes an increase in<br>
discharge pressure, which, in turn, causes the compressor's suction pressure to increase. The<br>
curves connecting states 2 and 3 and states 4 and 1 on Fig. 6B 3 both shift upward due to<br>
increases in heat sink temperature. An upward shift in curves 4 through 1 or an increase in<br>
refrigerant evaporating temperature results in a decrease in the evaporating approach<br>
temperature. As the approach temperature decreases, the mass flow rate through the evaporator<br>
must increase in order to remove the proper amount of heat from the chilled water loop.<br>
Therefore, increasing heat sink temperatures cause evaporating pressure to increase, which leads<br>
to increased refrigerant mass flow rate through the evaporator. The combined effect of higher<br>
refrigerant mass flow rate through the evaporator and reduced approach temperature causes a<br>
decrease in superheat temperatures. Therefore, an inverse relationship exists between heat sink<br>
temperature and superheat temperatures.<br>
With decreasing refrigerant charge, the curve connecting states 2 and 3 in Fig. 6B shifts<br>
downward and the subcooling level decreases or state 3 on the T-s diagram in Fig. 6B moves to<br>
the right. Bubbles begin to appear in the liquid line leading to the expansion device due to an<br>
increased amount of gaseous refrigerant leaving the condenser. Without the proper amount of<br>
subcooling in the refrigerant entering the expansion device (state 3 in Fig. 6B), the device does<br>
not operate optimally. In addition, a decrease in refrigerant charge causes a decrease in the<br>
amount of liquid refrigerant that flows into the evaporator and a subsequent decrease in capacity<br>
and increase in superheat and suction pressure. Thus, an inverse relationship exists between<br>
refrigerant charge level and superheat temperature.<br>
According to the present invention, the discharge from the condenser includes a<br>
compliant reservoir, and thus may provide increased opportunity to achieve the desired level of<br>
subcooling. Likewise, because a reservoir is provided, the refrigerant charge is presumed to be<br>
in excess of that required under all operating circumstances, and therefore it will not be limiting.<br>
It is also possible to have a hybrid control strategy, wherein the reservoir is undersize, and<br>
therefore under light load, refrigerant accumulates in a reservoir, while under heavy load, the<br>
refrigerant charge is limiting. The control system according to the present invention may, of<br>
course, compensate for this factor in known manner. However, preferably, when the refrigerant<br>
charge is not limiting, the superheat temperature is independently controlled. Likewise, even<br>
where the refrigerant charge is sufficient, the evaporator may be artificially starved as a part of<br>
the control strategy.<br>
Under extreme refrigerant undercharge conditions (below -20% charge), refrigerant<br>
undercharge causes an increase in suction pressure. In general, the average suction pressure<br>
increases with increasing refrigerant charge during all charge levels above -20%. Refrigerant<br>
charge level is a significant variable in determining both superheat temperature and suction<br>
pressure.<br>
A system and method for measuring, analyzing and manipulating the capacity and<br>
efficiency of a refrigeration system by instrumenting the refrigeration system to measure<br>
efficiency, selecting a process variable for manipulation, and altering the process variable is<br>
provided. The process variable may be varied during operation of the refrigeration system while<br>
measuring efficiency thereof.<br>
In an industrial process, a refrigeration system must have sufficient capacity to cool the<br>
target to a desired level. If the capacity is insufficient, the underlying process may fail,<br>
sometimes catastrophically. Thus, maintaining sufficient capacity, and often a margin of<br>
reserve, is a critical requirement. Therefore, it is understood that where capacity is limiting,<br>
deviations from optimal system operation may be tolerated or even desired in order to maintain<br>
the process within acceptable levels. Over the long term, steps to ensure that the system has<br>
adequate capacity for efficient operation may be taken. For example, system maintenance to<br>
reduce tube bundle scale or other heat transfer impediment, cleaning of refrigerant (e.g., to<br>
remove excess oil), and refrigerant-side heat transfer surfaces, and purging of non-condensable<br>
gases may be performed alone or in combination.<br>
Efficiency is also important, although an inefficient system does not necessarily fail.<br>
Efficiency and system capacity are often related, since inefficiency typically reduces system<br>
capacity.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, a set of state measurements are taken<br>
of the refrigeration system, which are then analyzed for self-consistency and to extract<br>
fundamental parameters, such as efficiency. Self-consistency, for example, assesses<br>
presumptions inherent in the system model, and therefore may indicate deviation of the actual<br>
system operation from the model operation. As the actual system deviates from the model, so<br>
too will the actual measurements of system parameters deviate from their thermodynamic<br>
theoretical counterparts. For example, as heat exchanger performance declines, due for example<br>
to scale accumulation on the tube bundle, or as compressor superheat temperature increases, for<br>
example due to non-condensable gases, these factors will be apparent in an adequate set of<br>
measurements of a state of the system. Such measurements may be used to estimate the capacity<br>
of the refrigeration system, as well as factors which lead to inefficiency of the system. These, in<br>
turn, can be used to estimate performance improvements which can be made to the system by<br>
returning it to an optimal state, and to perform a cost-benefit analysis in favor of any such<br>
efforts.<br>
Typically, before extensive and expensive system maintenance is performed, it is<br>
preferable to instrument the system for real time performance monitoring, rather than simple<br>
state analysis. Such real time performance modeling is typically expensive, and not apart of<br>
normal system operation; whereas adequate information for a state analysis may be generally<br>
available from system controls. By employing a real time monitoring system, analysis of<br>
operational characteristics in a fluctuating environment may be assessed.<br>
This scheme may also be used in other types of systems, and is not limited to<br>
refrigeration systems. Thus, a set of sensor measurements are obtained and analyzed with<br>
respect to system model. The analysis may then be used to tune system operational parameters,<br>
instigate a maintenance procedure, or as part of a cost-benefit analysis. Systems to which this<br>
method may be applied include, among others, internal combustion engines, turbomachinery,<br>
hydraulic and pneumatic systems.<br>
Preferably, the efficiency is recorded in conjunction with the process variables. Thus, for<br>
each system, the actual sensitivity of efficiency, detected directly or by surrogate measures, to a<br>
process variable, may be measured.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, a business method is provided for<br>
maintaining complex systems based on a cost-savings basis, rather than the typical cost of<br>
service or flat fee basis. According to this aspect of the invention, instead of servicing and<br>
maintaining a system for a fee based on a direct cost thereof, compensation is based on a system<br>
performance metric. For example, a baseline system performance is measured. Thereafter, a<br>
minimum system capacity is defined, and the system is otherwise serviced at the significant<br>
discretion of the service organization, presumably based on the cost-benefit of such service, with<br>
the service organization being compensated based on the system performance, for example a<br>
percentage of cost savings over the baseline. According to the present invention, data from the<br>
control system may be used to determine degradation of system parameters from an efficient<br>
stale. The invention also allows monitoring of system performance, and communication of such<br>
performance data remotely to a service organization, such as through radio uplink, modem<br>
communication over telephone lines, or computer network. This communication may also permit<br>
immediate notification to the service organization of process shift, potentially in time to prevent<br>
subsequent and consequent system failure.<br>
In this case, the system is performance monitored frequently or continuously, and if the<br>
system capacity is sufficient, decisions are made whether, at any time, it would be cost efficient<br>
to perform certain maintenance services, such as refrigerant purification, evaporator descaling or<br>
cleaning, purging of non-condensing gasses, or the like. Typically, if system capacity is<br>
substantially diminished below a prespecified reserve value (which may vary seasonally, or<br>
based on other factors), service is required. However, even in this case, degradation in system<br>
capacity may be due to a variety of factors, and the most efficient remediation may then be<br>
selected to cost-efficiently achieve adequate system performance.<br>
After system service or maintenance, the control system may be initialized or retimed to<br>
ensure that pre-service or pre-maintenance parameters do not erroneously govern system<br>
operation.<br>
According to a second main embodiment of the present invention, multivariate<br>
optimization and control may be conducted. In the case of multivariate analysis and control,<br>
interaction between variables or complex sets of time-constants may require a complex control<br>
system. A number of types of control may be implemented to optimize the operation of the<br>
system. Typically, after the appropriate type of control is selected, it must be tuned to the<br>
system, thus defining efficient operation and the relation of the input variables from sensors on<br>
the efficiency of the system. Often, controls often account for time delays inherent in the<br>
system, for example to avoid undesirable oscillation or instability. In many instances,<br>
simplifying presumptions, or segmentations are made in analyzing the operating space to provide<br>
traditional analytic solutions to the control problems. In other instances, non-linear techniques<br>
are employed to analyze the entire range of input variables. Finally, hybrid techniques are<br>
employed using both non-linear techniques and simplifying presumptions or segmentation of the<br>
operating space.<br>
For example, in the second main embodiment of the invention, it is preferred that the<br>
range of operating conditions be segmented along orthogonal delineations, and the sensitivity of<br>
the system to process variable manipulation be measured for each respective variable within a<br>
segment. This, for example, permits a monotonic change in each variable during a testing or<br>
training phase, rather than requiring both increasing and decreasing respective variables in order<br>
to map the entire operating space. On the other hand, in the case of a single variable, it is<br>
preferred that the variable be altered continuously while measurements are talcing place in order<br>
to provide a high speed of measurement.<br>
Of course, it may not be possible to measure orthogonal (non-interactive) parameters.<br>
Therefore, another aspect of the invention provides a capability for receiving a variety of data<br>
relating to system operation and performance, and analyzing system performance based on this<br>
data. Likewise, during a continuous system performance monitoring, it may be possible to<br>
employ existing (normally occurring) system perturbations to determine system characteristics.<br>
Alternately, the system may be controlled to include a sufficient set of perturbations to determine<br>
the pertinent system performance parameters, in a manner which does not cause inefficient or<br>
undesirable system performance.<br>
In an adaptive control system, the sensitivity of the operating efficiency to small<br>
perturbations in the control variables are measured during actual operation of the system, rather<br>
than in a testing or training mode, as in an autotuning system, which may be difficult to arrange<br>
and which may be inaccurate or incomplete if the system configuration or characteristics change<br>
after training or testing. Manual tuning, which requires an operator to run different test or trial<br>
and error procedures to determine the appropriate control parameters, is typically not feasible,<br>
since the characteristics of each installation over the entire operating range are not often fully<br>
characterized and are subject to change over time. Some manual tuning methods are described<br>
in D. E. Seborg, T. F. Edgar, and D. A. Mellichamp, Process Dynamics and Control, John Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons, New York (1989) and A. B. Corripio, Tuning of Industrial Control Systems, Instrument<br>
Society of America, Research Triangle Park, N.C. (1990).<br>
Autotuning methods require a periodically initiated tuning procedure, during which the<br>
controller will interrupt the normal process control to automatically determine the appropriate<br>
control parameters. The control parameters thus set will remain unchanged until the next tuning<br>
procedure. Some autotuning procedres are described in K. J. Astrom and T. Hagglund,<br>
Automatic Tuning of PID Controllers, Instrument Society of America, Research Triangle Park,<br>
N.C. (1988). Autotuning controllers may be operator or self initiated, either at fixed periods,<br>
based on an external event, or based on a calculated deviance from a desired system<br>
performance.<br>
With adaptive control methods, the control parameters are automatically adjusted during<br>
normal operation to adapt to changes in process dynamics. Further, the control parameters are<br>
continuously updated to prevent the degraded performance which may occur between the tunings<br>
of the other methods. On the other hand, adaptive control methods may result in inefficiency<br>
due to the necessary periodic variance from an "optimal" condition in order to test the<br>
optimally. Further, adaptive controls may be complex and require a high degree of intelligence.<br>
Advantageously, the control may monitor system operation, and select or modify appropriate<br>
events for data acquisition. For example, in a system operating according to a pulse-width<br>
modulation paradigm, the pulse width and/or frequency may be varied in particular manner in<br>
order to obtain data about various operational states, without causing the system to unnecessarily<br>
deviate from acceptable operational ranges.<br>
Numerous adaptive control methods have been developed. See, for example, C. J. Harris<br>
and S. A. Billings, Self-Tuning and Adaptive Control: Theory and Applications, Peter<br>
Peregrinus LTD (1981). There are three main approaches to adaptive control: model reference<br>
adaptive control ("MRAC"), self-tuning control, and pattern recognition adaptive control<br>
("PRAC"). The first two approaches, MRAC and self-tuning, rely on system models which are<br>
generally quite complex. The complexity of the models is necessitated by the need to anticipate<br>
unusual or abnormal operating conditions. Specifically, MRAC involves adjusting the control<br>
parameters until the response of the system to a command signal follows the response of a<br>
reference model. Self-tuning control involves determining the parameters of a process model on<br>
line and adjusting the control parameters based upon the parameters of the process model.<br>
Methods for performing MRAC and self-tuning control are described in K. J. Astrom and B.<br>
Wittenmark, Adaptive Control, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company (1989). In industrial<br>
chillers, adequate models of the system are typically unavailable for implementing the control, so<br>
that self-tuning controls are preferred over traditional MRAC. On the other hand, a sufficient<br>
model may be available for estimating system efficiency and capacity, as discussed above.<br>
With PRAC, parameters that characterize the pattern of the closed-loop response are<br>
determined after significant setpoint changes or load disturbances. The control parameters are<br>
then adjusted based upon the characteristic parameters of the closed-loop response. A pattern<br>
recognition adaptive controller known as EXACT is described by T. W. Kraus and T. J. Myron,<br>
"Self-Tuning PID Controller uses Pattern Recognition Approach," Control Engineering, pp. 106-<br>
111, June 1984, E. H. Bristol and T. W. Kraus, "Life with Pattern Adaptation," Proceedings<br>
1984 American Control Conference, pp. 888-892, San Diego, Calif. (1984), and K. J. Astrom<br>
and T. Hagglund, Automatic Tuning of PID Controllers, Instrument Society of America,<br>
Research Triangle Park, N.C. (1988). See also U.S. Pat. No. Re. 33,267, expressly incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The EXACT method, like other adaptive control methods, does not require<br>
operator intervention to adjust the control parameters under normal operation. Before normal<br>
operation may begin, EXACT requires a carefully supervised startup and testing period. During<br>
this period, an engineer determines the optimal initial values for controller gain, integral time,<br>
and derivative time. The engineer also determines the anticipated noise band and maximum wait<br>
time of the process. The noise band is a value representative of the expected amplitude of noise<br>
on the feedback signal. The maximum wait time is the maximum time the EXACT algorithm<br>
will wait for a second peak in the feedback signal after detecting a first peak. Further, before an<br>
EXACT-bascd controller is put into normal use, the operator may also specify other parameters,<br>
such as the maximum damping factor, the maximum overshoot, the parameter change limit, the<br>
derivative factor, and the step size. In fact, the provision of these parameters by an expert<br>
engineer is generally appropriate in the installation process for any control of an industrial<br>
chiller, and therefore such a manual definition of initial operating points is preferred over<br>
techniques which commence without a priori assumptions, since an unguided exploration of the<br>
operating space may be inefficient or dangerous.<br>
According to the present invention, the system operational parameters need not be<br>
limited to an a priori "safe" operating range, where relatively extreme parameter values might<br>
provide improved performance, while maintaining a margin of safety, while detecting or<br>
predicting erroneous or artifact sensor data. Thus, using a model of the system constructed<br>
during operation, possibly along with manual input of probable normal operational limits, the<br>
system may analyze sensor data to determine a probability of system malfunction, and therefore<br>
with greater reliability adopt aggressive control strategies. If the probability exceeds a threshold,<br>
an error may be indicated or other remedial action taken.<br>
A second known pattern recognition adaptive controller is described by Chuck Rohrer<br>
and Clay G. Nelser in "Self-Tuning Using a Pattern Recognition Approach," Johnson Controls,<br>
Inc., Research Brief 228 (Jun. 13, 1986). The Rohrer controller calculates the optimal control<br>
parameters based on a damping factor, which in turn is determined by the slopes of the feedback<br>
signal, and requires an engineer to enter a variety of initial values before normal operation may<br>
commence, such as the initial values for a proportional band, an integral time, a deadband, a tune<br>
noise band, a tune change factor, an input filter, and an output filter. This system thus<br>
emphasizes temporal control parameters.<br>
Manual tuning of loops can take a long time, especially for processes with slow<br>
dynamics, including industrial and commercial chillers. Different methods for autotuning PID<br>
controllers are described by Astrom, K. J., and T. Hagglund, Automatic Tuning of PID<br>
Controllers, Instrument Society of American, Research Triangle Park, N.C., 1988, and Seborg,<br>
D. E. T., T. F. Edgar, and D. A. Mellichamp, Process Dynamics and Control, John Wiley &amp;<br>
sons, 1989. Several methods are based on the open loop transient response to a step change in<br>
controller output and other methods are based on the frequency response while under some form<br>
of feedback control. Open loop step response methods are sensitive to load disturbances, and<br>
frequency response methods require a large amount of time to tune systems with long time<br>
constants. The Ziegler-Nichols transient response method characterizes the response to a step<br>
change in controller output, however, implementation of this method is sensitive to noise. See<br>
also, Nishikawa, Yoshikazu, Nobuo Sannomiya, Tokuji Ohta, and Haruki Tanaka, "A Method<br>
for Autotuning of PID Control Parameters," Automatica, Volume 20, No. 3, 1984.<br>
For some systems, it is often difficult to determine if a process has reached a steady-state.<br>
In many systems, if the test is stopped too early, the time delay and time constant estimates may<br>
be significantly different than the actual values. For example, if a test is stopped after three time<br>
constants of the first order response, then the estimated time constant equals 78% of the actual<br>
time constant, and if the test is stopped after two time constants, then the estimated time constant<br>
equals 60% of the actual time constant. Thus, it is important to analyze the system in such a way<br>
as to accurately determine time-constants. Thus, in a self-tuning system, the algorithm may<br>
obtain tuning data from normal perturbations of the system, or by periodically testing the<br>
sensitivity of the plant to modest perturbations about the operating point of the controlled<br>
variable(s). If the system determines that the operating point is inefficient, the controlled<br>
variable(s) are altered in order to improve efficiency toward an optimal operating point. The<br>
efficiency may be determined on an absolute basis, such as by measuring kWatt hours consumed<br>
(or other energy consumption metric) per BTU of cooling, or through surrogate measurements of<br>
energy consumption or cooling, such as temperature differentials and flow data of refrigerant<br>
near the compressor and/or water in the secondary loop near the evaporator/heat exchanger.<br>
Where cost per BTU is not constant, either because there are different sources available, or the<br>
cost varies over time, efficiency may be measured in economic terms and optimized accordingly.<br>
Likewise, the efficiency calculation may be modified by including other relevant "costs".<br>
A full power management system (PMS) is not required in order to optimize the<br>
efficiency. However, this PMS may be provided depending on cost and availability, or other<br>
considerations.<br>
In many instances, parameters will vary linearly with load and be independent of other<br>
variables, thus simplifying analysis and permitting traditional (e.g., linear, proportional-integral-<br>
differential (PID)) control design. See, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,568,377, 5,506,768, and 5,355,305,<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference. On the other hand, parameters which have<br>
multifactorial dependencies are not easily resolved. In this case, it may be preferable to segment<br>
the control system into linked invariant multifactorial control loops, and time-varying simple<br>
control loops, which together efficiently control the entire system, as in the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Alternately, a neural network or fuzzy-neural network control may be employed. In order<br>
to train a neural network, a number of options are available. One option is to provide a specific<br>
training mode, in which the operating conditions are varied, generally methodically, over the<br>
entire operating space, by imposing artificial or controlled loads and extrinsic parameters on the<br>
system, with predefined desired system responses, to provide a training set. Thereafter, the<br>
neural network is trained, for example by back propagation of errors, to produce an output that<br>
moves the system toward an optimal operating point for the actual load conditions. The<br>
controlled variables may be, for example, oil concentration in the refrigerant and/or refrigerant<br>
charge. See, U.S. Patent No. 5,579,993, expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Another option is to operate the system in a continual learning mode in which the local'<br>
operating space of the system is mapped by the control during operation, in order to determine a<br>
sensitivity of the system to perturbations in process variables, such as process load, ambient<br>
temperature, oil concentration in the refrigerant and/or refrigerant charge. When the system<br>
determines that the present operating point is suboptimal, it alters the operating point toward a<br>
presumable more efficient condition. The system may also broadcast an alert that specific<br>
changes are recommended to return the system to a more efficient operating mode, where such<br>
changes are not controlled by the system itself. If the process has insufficient variability to<br>
adequately map the operating point, the control algorithm may conduct a methodical search of<br>
the space or inject a pseudorandom signal into one or more controlled variables seeking to detect<br>
the effect on the output (efficiency). Generally, such search techniques will themselves have<br>
only a small effect on system efficiency, and will allow the system to learn new conditions,<br>
without explicitly entering a learning mode after each alteration in the system.<br>
Preferably, the control builds a map or model of the operating space from experience,<br>
and, when the actual system performance corresponds to the map or model, uses this map or<br>
model to predict an optimal operating point and directly control the system to achieve the<br>
predicted most-efficient state. On the other hand, when the actual performance does not<br>
correspond to the map or model, the control seeks to generate a new map or model. It is noted<br>
that such a map or model may itself have little physical significance, and thus is generally useful<br>
only for application within the specific network which created it. See, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,506,768, expressly incorporated herein by reference. It may also be possible to constrain the<br>
network to have weights which correspond to physical parameters, although this constraint may<br>
lead to either control errors or inefficient implementation and realization.<br>

Thus, while a system model may be useful, especially for large changes in system<br>
operating parameters, the adaptation mechanism is advantageous in that it does not rely on an<br>
explicit system model, unlike many of the on-line adaptation mechanisms such as those based on<br>
Lyapunov methods. See Wang, 1994; Kang, H. and Vachtsevanos, G., "Adaptive fuzzy logic<br>

The adaptive fuzzy controller (AFC) is a nonlinear, multiple-input multiple-output<br>
(MIMO) controller that couples a fuzzy control algorithm with an adaptation mechanism to<br>
continuously improve system performance. The adaptation mechanism modifies the location of<br>
the output membership functions in response to the performance of the system. The adaptation<br>
mechanism can be used off-line, on-line, or a combination of both. The AFC can be used as a<br>
feedback controller, which acts using measured process outputs and a reference trajectory, or as<br>
a feedback controller with feedforward compensation, which acts using not only measured<br>
process outputs and a reference trajectory but also measured disturbances and other system<br>
parameters. See, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,740, 5,740,324, expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
As discussed above, a significant process variable is the oil content of the refrigerant in<br>
the evaporator. This variable may, in fact, be slowly controlled, typically by removal only, since<br>
only on rare occasions will the oil content be lower than desired for any significant length of<br>
time, and removing added oil is itself inefficient. To define the control algorithm, the process<br>
variable, e.g., oil content, is continuously varied by partially distilling the refrigerant at, or<br>
entering, the evaporator, to remove oil, providing clean refrigerant to the evaporator in an auto-<br>
tuning procedure. Over time, the oil content will approach zero. The system performance is<br>
monitored during this process. Through this method, the optimal oil content in the evaporator<br>
and the sensitivity to changes in oil content can be determined. In a typical installation, the<br>
optimum oil concentration in the evaporator is near 0%, while when the system is retrofitted<br>
with a control system for controlling the oil content of the evaporator, it is well above optimum.<br>
Therefore, the auto-tuning of the control may occur simultaneously with the remediation of the<br>
inefficiency.<br>
In fact, the oil content of the evaporator may be independently controlled, or controlled in<br>
concert with other variables, such as refrigerant charge (or effective charge, in the case of the<br>
preferred embodiment which provides an accumulator to buffer excess refrigerant and a control<br>
loop to regulate level of refrigerant in the evaporator).<br>
According to one design, an external reservoir of refrigerant is provided. Refrigerant is<br>
withdrawn from the evaporator through a partial distillation apparatus into the reservoir, with the<br>
oil separately stored. Based on the control optimization, refrigerant and oil are separately<br>
returned to the system, i.e., refrigerant vapor to the evaporator and oil to the compressor loop. In<br>
this way, the optimum oil concentration may be maintained for respective refrigerant charge<br>
levels. It is noted that this system is generally asymmetric; withdrawal and partial distillation of<br>
refrigerant is relatively slow, while charging the system with refrigerant and oil are relatively<br>
quick. If rapid withdrawal of refrigerant is desired, the partial distillation system may be<br>
temporarily bypassed. However, typically it is more important to meet peak loads quickly than<br>
to obtain most efficient operating parameters subsequent to peak loads.<br>
It is noted that, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, both<br>
refrigerant-to-oil ratio and refrigerant fill may be independently controlled variables of system<br>
operation.<br>
The compressor may also be modulated, for example by controlling a compression ratio,<br>
compressor speed, compressor duty cycle (pulse frequency, pulse width and/or hybrid<br>
modulation), compressor inlet flow restriction, or the like.<br>
While the immediate efficiency of the evaporator may be measured assuming a single<br>
compartment within the evaporator, and therefore short time delay for mixing, it is also noted<br>
that an oil phase may adhere to the evaporator tube walls. By flowing clean refrigerant through<br>
the evaporator, this oil phase, which has a longer time-constant for release from the walls than a<br>
mixing process of the bulk refrigerant, is removed. Advantageously, by modeling the evaporator<br>
and monitoring system performance, by removing the oil phase from the refrigerant side of the<br>
evaporator tub walls, a scale or other deposit on the water-side of the tube wall may be<br>
estimated. This, it turns out, is a useful method for determining an effect on efficiency of such<br>
deposits, and may allow an intelligent decision as to when an expensive and time consuming<br>
descaling of the tube bundles is required. Likewise, by removing the excess oil film from the<br>
tube wall, efficiency may be maintained, delaying the need for descaling.<br>
The optimal refrigerant charge level may be subject to variation with nominal chiller load<br>
and plant temperature, while related (dependent) variables include efficiency (kW/ton),<br>
superheat temperature, subcooling temperature, discharge pressure, superheat temperature,<br>
suction pressure and chilled water supply temperature percent error. Direct efficiency<br>
measurement of kilowatt-hours per ton may be performed, or inferred from other variables,<br>
preferably process temperatures and flow rates.<br>
Complex interdependencies of the variables, as well as the preferred use of surrogate<br>
variables instead of direct efficiency data, weigh in favor of a non-linear neural network model,<br>
for example similar to the model employed in Bailey, Margaret B., "System Performance<br>
Characteristics of a Helical Rotary Screw Air-Cooled Chiller Operating Over a Range of<br>
Refrigerant Charge Conditions", ASHRAE Trans. 1998 104(2). In this case, the model has an<br>
input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The output layer typically has one node for<br>
each controlled variable, while the input layer contains one node for each signal. The Bailey<br>
neural network includes five nodes in the first hidden layer and two nodes for each output node<br>
in the second hidden layer. Preferably, the sensor data is processed prior to input into the neural<br>
network model. For example, linear processing of.sensor outputs, data normalization, statistical<br>
processing, etc. may be performed to reduce noise, provide appropriate data sets, or to reduce the<br>
topological or computational complexity of the neural network. Fault detection may also be<br>
integrated in the system, either by way of further elements of the neural network (or a separate<br>
neural network) or by analysis of the sensor data by other means.<br>
Feedback optimization control strategies are may be applied to transient and dynamic<br>
situations. Evolutionary optimization or genetic algorithms, which intentionally introduce small<br>
perturbations of the independent control variable, to compare the result to an objective function,<br>
may be made directly upon the process itself. In fact, the entire theory of genetic algorithms may<br>
be applied to the optimization of refrigeration systems. See, e.g., US Patent Nos. 6,496,761;<br>

According to the present invention, the control may operate on multiple independent or<br>
interdependent parameters. Steady state optimization may be used on complex processes<br>
exhibiting long time constants and with disturbance variables that change infrequently. Hybrid<br>
strategies are also employed in situations involving both long-term and short-term dynamics.<br>
The hybrid algorithms are generally more complex and require custom tailoring for a truly<br>
effective implementation. Feedback control can sometimes be employed in certain situations to<br>
achieve optimal plant performance.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a refrigerant-side vs. water side heat<br>
transfer impairment in an evaporator heat exchanger may be distinguished by selectively<br>
modifying a refrigerant composition, for example to remove oil and other impurities. For<br>
example, as the oil level of the refrigerant is reduced, oil deposits on the refrigerant side of the<br>
heat exchanger tubes will also be reduced, since the oil deposit is generally soluble in the pure<br>
refrigerant. The heat exchanger may then be analyzed in at least two different ways. First, if the<br>
refrigerant-side is completely cleaned of deposits, then any remaining diminution of system<br>
performance must be due to deposits on the water side. Second, assuming a linear process of<br>
removing impairment on the refrigerant side, the amount of refrigerant-side impairment may be<br>
estimated without actually removing the entire impairment. While, as stated above, a certain<br>
amount of oil may result in more efficient operation than pure refrigerant, this may be added<br>
back, if necessary. Since this process of purifying the refrigerant is relatively simpler and less<br>
costly than descaling the evaporator to remove water-side heat exchange impairment, and is of<br>
independent benefit to system operation, it therefore provides an efficient procedure to<br>
determining the need for system maintenance. On the other hand, refrigerant purification<br>
consumes energy, and may reduce capacity, and results in very low, possibly suboptimal, oil<br>
concentrations in the evaporator, so continuous purification is generally not employed.<br>
Thus, it is seen that a perturbation in system response in order to determine a parameter<br>
of the system is not limited to compressor control, and, for example, changes in refrigerant<br>
purity, refrigerant charge, oil level, and the like, may be made in order to explore system<br>
operation.<br>
Multivariate processes in which there are numerous interactive effects of independent<br>
variables upon the process performance can best be optimized by the use of feedforward control.<br>
However, an adequate predictive mathematical model of the process is required. This, for<br>
example, may be particularly applicable to the inner compressor control loop. Note that the on-<br>
line control computer will evaluate the consequences of variable changes using the model rather<br>
than perturbing the process itself. Such a predictive mathematical model is therefore of<br>
particular use in its failure, which is indicative of system deviation from a nominal operating<br>
state, and possibly indicative of required system maintenance to restore system operation.<br>
To produce a viable optimization result, the mathematical model in a feedforward<br>
technique must be an accurate representation of the process. To ensure a one-to-one<br>
correspondence with the process, the model is preferably updated just prior to each use. Model<br>
updating is a specialized form of feedback in which model predictions are compared with the<br>
current plant operating status. Any variances noted are then used to adjust certain key<br>
coefficients in the model to enforce the required agreement. Typically, such models are based on<br>
physical process elements, and therefore may be used to imply real and measurable<br>
characteristics.<br>
hi chillers, many of the relevant timeconstants are very long. While this reduces short<br>
latency processing demands of a real time controller, it also makes corrections slow to<br>
implement, and poses the risk of error, instability or oscillation if the timeconstants are<br>
erroneously computed. Further, in order to provide a neural network with direct temporal<br>
control sensitivity, a large number of input nodes may be required to represent the data trends.<br>
Preferably, temporal calculations are therefore made by linear computational method, with<br>
transformed time-varying data input to the neural network. The transform may be, for example,<br>
in the time-frequency representation, or time-wavelet representation. For example, first and<br>
second derivatives (or higher order, as may be appropriate) of sensor data or transformed sensor<br>
data may be calculated and fed to the network. Alternately or additionally, the output of the<br>
neural network may be subjected to processing to generate appropriate process control signals. It<br>
is noted that, for example, if the refrigerant charge in a chiller is varied, it is likely that critical<br>
timeconstants of the system will also vary. Thus, a model which presumes that the system has a<br>
set of invariant timeconstants may produce errors, and the preferred system according to the<br>
present invention makes no such critical presumptions. The control system therefore preferably<br>
employs flexible models to account for the interrelation of variables.<br>
Other potentially useful process parameters to measure include moisture, refrigerant<br>
breakdown products, lubricant breakdown products, non-condensable gasses, and other known<br>
impurities in the refrigerant. Likewise, there are also mechanical parameters which may have<br>
optimizable values, such as mineral deposits in the brine tubes (a small amount of mineral<br>
deposits may increase turbulence and therefore reduce a surface boundary layer), and air or water<br>
flow parameters for cooling the condenser.<br>
Typically, there are a set of process parameters which theoretically have an optimum<br>
value of 0, while in practice, achieving this value is difficult or impossible to obtain or maintain.<br>
This difficulty may be expressed as a service cost or an energy cost, but in any case, the control<br>
system may be set to allow theoretically suboptimal parameter readings, which are practically<br>
acceptable and preferable to remediation. A direct cost-benefit analysis may be implemented.<br>
However, at some threshold, remediation is generally deemed efficient. The control system may<br>
therefore monitor these parameters and either indicate an alarm, implement a control strategy, or<br>
otherwise act. The threshold may, in fact, be adaptive or responsive to other system conditions;<br>
for example, a remediation process would preferably be deferred during peak load periods if the<br>
remediation itself would adversely affect system performance, and sufficient reserve capacity<br>
exists to continue operation.<br>
Thus, it is seen that in some instances, as exemplified by oil levels in the evaporator, an<br>
initial (or periodic) determination of system sensitivity to the sensed parameter is preferred,<br>
while in other instances, an adaptive control algorithm is preferred.<br>
In the case of autotuning processes, after the optimization calculations are complete, the<br>
process variable, e.g., the oil content of the evaporator, may be restored to the optimal level. It is<br>
noted that the process variable may change over time, e.g., the oil level in the evaporator will<br>
increase, so it is desired to select an initial condition which will provide the maximum effective<br>
efficiency between the initial optimization and a subsequent maintenance to restore the system to<br>
efficient operation. Therefore, the optimization preferably determines an optimum operating<br>
zone, and the process variable established at the lower end of the zone after measurement. This<br>
lower end may be zero, but need not be, and may vary for each system measured.<br>
In this way, it is not necessary to continuously control the process variable, and rather the<br>
implemented control algorithm may, for example, include a wide deadband and manual<br>
implementation of the control process.<br>
A monitor may be provided for the process variable, to determine when reoptimization is<br>
necessary. During reoptimzation, it is not always necessary to conduct further efficiency<br>
measurements; rather, the prior measurements may be used to redefine the desired operating<br>
regime.<br>
Thus, after the measurements are taken to a limit (e.g., near zero oil or beyond the<br>
expected operating regime), the system is restored, if necessary, to achieve a desired initial<br>
efficiency, allowing for gradual variations, e.g., accumulation of oil in the evaporator, while still<br>
maintaining appropriate operation for a suitable period.<br>
An efficiency measurement, or surrogate measurement(s) (e.g., compressor amperage,<br>
thermodynamic parameters) may subsequently be employed to determine when process variable,<br>
e.g., the oil level, has change or accumulated to sufficient levels to require remediation.<br>
Alternately, a direct oil concentration measurement may be taken of the refrigerant in the<br>
evaporator. In the case of refrigeration compressor oil, for example, the monitor may be an<br>
optical sensor, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,694,210, expressly incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
A closed loop feedback device may seeks to maintain a process variable within a desired<br>
range. Thus, a direct oil concentration gage, typically a refractometer, measures the oil content<br>
of the refrigerant. A setpoint control, proportional, differential, integral control, fuzzy logic<br>
control or the like is used to control a bypass valve to a refrigerant distillation device, which is<br>
typically oversize, and operating well within its control limits. As the oil level increases to a<br>
level at which efficiency is impaired, the refrigerant is distilled to remove oil. The oil is, for<br>
example, returned to the compressor lubrication system, while the refrigerant is returned to the<br>
compressor inlet. In this manner, closed loop feedback control may be employed to maintain the<br>
system at optimum efficiency. It is noted that it is also possible to employ an active in-line<br>
distillation process which does not bypass the evaporator. For example, the Zugibeast® system<br>
(Hudson Technologies, Inc.) may be employed, however, this is system typically larger and more<br>
complex than necessary for this purpose. U.S. Patent No. 5,377,499, expressly incorporated<br>
herein by reference, thus provides a portable device for refrigerant reclamation. In this system,<br>
refrigerant may be purified on site, rather than requiring, in each instance, transporting of the<br>
refrigerant to a recycling facility. U.S. 5,709,091, expressly incorporated herein by reference,<br>
also discloses a refrigerant recycling method and apparatus.<br>
In the oil separating device, advantageously, the refrigerant is fed into a fractional<br>
distillation chamber controlled to be at a temperature below its boiling point, and therefore<br>
condenses into a bulk of liquid refrigerant remaining within the vessel. Relatively pure<br>
refrigerant is present in the gas phase, while less volatile impurities remain in the liquid phase.<br>
The pure refrigerant is used to establish the chamber temperature, thus providing a sensitive and<br>
stable system. The fractionally distilled purified liquid refrigerant is available from one port,<br>
while impurities are removed through another port. The purification process may be manual or<br>
automated, continuous or batch.<br>
One aspect of the invention derives from a relatively new understanding that the<br>
optimum oil level in the evaporator of a refrigeration system may vary by manufacturer, model<br>
and particular system, and that these variables are significant in the efficiency of the process and<br>
may change over time. The optimal oil level need not be zero, for example in fin tube<br>
evaporators, the optimal oil level may be between 1-5%, at which the oil bubbles and forms a<br>
film on the tube surfaces, increasing heat transfer coefficient. On the other hand, so-called<br>
nucleation boiling heat transfer tubes have a substantially lower optimal oil concentration,<br>
typically less than about 1%.<br>
Seeking to maintain a 0% oil concentration may itself be inefficient, since the oil<br>
removal process may require expenditure of energy and bypass of refrigerant, and an operating<br>
system has a low but continual level of leakage. Further, the oil level in the condenser may also<br>
impact system efficiency, in a manner inconsistent with the changes in efficiency of the<br>
evaporator.<br>
Thus, this aspect of the invention does not presume an optimum level of a particular<br>
process variable parameter. Rather, a method according to the invention explores the optimum<br>
value, and thereafter allows the system to be set near the optimum. Likewise, the method<br>
permits periodic 'tune-ups" of the system, rather than requiring continuous tight maintenance of<br>
a control parameter, although the invention also provides a system and method for achieving<br>
continuous monitoring and/or control.<br>
The refrigeration systems or chillers may be large industrial devices, for example 3500<br>
ton devices which draw 4160V at 500A max (2 MW). Therefore, even small changes in<br>
efficiency may produce substantial savings in energy costs. Possibly more importantly, when<br>
efficiency drops, it is possible that the chiller is unable to maintain the process parameter within<br>
the desired range. During extended operation, for example, it is possible for the oil<br>
concentration in the evaporator to increase above 10%, and the overall capacity of the system to<br>
drop below 1500 tons. This can result in process deviations or failure, which may require<br>
immediate or expensive remediation. Proper maintenance, to achieve a high optimum<br>
efficiency, may be quite cost effective.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains upon<br>
reference to the following detailed description of one of the best modes for carrying out the<br>
invention, when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention are shown and described by way of illustration, and not of<br>
limitation, wherein:<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
As shown in Figs. 1-2, a typical tube in shell heat exchanger 1 consists of a set of parallel<br>
tubes 2 extending through a generally cylindrical shell 3. The tubes 2 are held in position with a<br>
tube plate 4, one of which is provided at each end 5 of the tubes 2. The tube plate 4 separates a<br>
first space 6, continuous with the interior of the tubes 7, from a second space 8, continuous with<br>
the exterior of the tubes 2. Typically, a domed flow distributor 9 is provided at each end of the<br>
shell 3, beyond the tube sheet 4, for distributing flow of the first medium from a conduit 10<br>
through the tubes 2, and thence back to a conduit 11. In the case of volatile refrigerant, the<br>
system need not be symmetric, as the flow volumes-and rates will differ at each side of the<br>
system. Not shown are optional baffles or other means for ensuring optimized flow distribution<br>
patterns in the heat exchange tubes.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a refrigerant cleansing system provides an inlet 112 for receiving<br>
refrigerant from the condenser, a purification system employing a controlled distillation process,<br>
and an outlet 150 for returning purified refrigerant. This portion of the system is similar to the<br>
system described in U.S. 5,377,499, expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compressor 100 compresses the refrigerant, while condenser 107, sheds the heal in<br>
the gas. A small amount of compressor oil is carried with the hot gas to the condenser 107,<br>
where it cools and condenses into a mixed liquid with the refrigerant, and exits through line 108<br>
and fitting 14. Isolation valves 102, 109 arc provided to selectively allow insertion of a partial<br>
distillation apparatus 105 within the refrigerant flow path. The refrigerant from the partial<br>
distillation apparatus 105 is received by the evaporator 103 through the isolation valve 102.<br>
The partial distillation apparatus 105 is capable of boiling contaminated refrigerant in a<br>
distillation chamber 130, with the distillation is controlled by throttling the refrigerant vapor.<br>
Contaminated refrigerant liquid 120 is fed, represented by directional arrow 110, through an inlet<br>
112 and a pressure regulating valve 114, into distillation chamber 116, to establish liquid level<br>
118. A contaminated liquid drain 121 is also provided, with valve 123. A high surface area<br>
conduit, such as a helical coil 122, is immersed beneath the level 118 of contaminated refrigerant<br>
liquid. Thermocouple 124 is placed at or near the center of coil 122 for measuring distillation<br>
temperature for purposes of temperature control unit 126, which controls the position of three-<br>
way valve 128, to establish as fractional distillation temperature. Temperature control valve 128<br>
operates, with bypass conduit 130, so that, as vapor is collected in the portion 132 of distillation<br>
chamber 116 above liquid level 118, it will feed through conduit 134 to compressor 136, to<br>
create a hot gas discharge at the output 138 of compressor 136, which are fed through three-way<br>
valve 128, under the control of temperature control 126. In those situations where thermocouple<br>
124 indicates a fractional distillation temperature above threshold, bypass conduit 130 receives<br>
some of the output from compressor 136; below threshold, the output will flow as indicated by<br>
arrow 140 into helical coil 122; near threshold, gases from the compressor output are allowed to<br>
flow partially along the bypass conduit and partially into the helical coil to maintain that<br>
temperature. Flow through bypass conduit 130 and from helical coil 122, in directions 142, 144,<br>
respectively, will pass through auxiliary condenser 146 and pressure regulating valve 148 to<br>
produce a distilled refrigerant outlet indicated by directional arrow 150. Alternatively,<br>
condenser 146 is controlled by an additional temperature control unit, controlled by the<br>
condenser output temperature. Thus, oil from the condenser 107 is removed before entering the<br>
evaporator 105. By running the system over time, oil accumulation in the evaporator 103 will<br>
drop, thus cleansing the system.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an instrumented chiller system, allowing periodic or batch reoptimization,<br>
or allowing continuous closed loop feedback control of operating parameters. Compressor 100<br>
is connected to a power meter 101, which accurately measures power consumption by measuring<br>
Volts and Amps drawn. The compressor 100 produces hot dense refrigerant vapor in line 106,<br>
which is fed to condenser 107, where latent heat of vaporization and the heat added by the<br>
compressor 100 is shed. The refrigerant carries a small amount of compressor lubricant oil. The<br>
condenser 107 is subjected to measurements of temperature and pressure by temperature gage<br>
155 and pressure gage 156. The liquefied, cooled refrigerant, including a portion of mixed oil, if<br>
fed through line 108 to an optional partial distillation apparatus 105, and hence to evaporator<br>
103. In the absence of the partial distillation apparatus 105, the oil from the condenser 107<br>
accumulates in the evaporator 103. The evaporator 103 is subjected to measurements of<br>
refrigerant temperature and pressure by temperature gage 155 and pressure gage 156. The<br>
chilled water in inlet line 152 and outlet line 154 of the evaporator 103 are also subject to<br><br>
temperature and pressure measurement by temperature gage 155 and pressure gage 156. The<br>
evaporated refrigerant from the evaporator 103 returns to the compressor through line 104.<br>
The power meter 101, temperature gage 155 and pressure gage 156 each provide data to a<br>
data acquisition system 157, which produces output 158 representative of an efficiency of the<br>
chiller, in, for example, BTU/kWH. An oil sensor 159 provides a continuous measurement of<br>
oil concentration in the evaporator 103, and may be used to control the partial distillation<br>
apparatus 105 or determine the need for intermittent reoptimization, based on an optimum<br>
operating regime. The power meter 101 or the data acquisition system 157 may provide<br>
surrogate measurements to estimate oil level in the evaporator or otherwise a need for oil<br>
removal.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the efficiency of the chiller varies with the oil concentration in the<br>
evaporator 103. Line 162 shows a non-monotonic relationship. After the relationship is<br>
determined by plotting the efficiency with respect to oil concentration, an operating regime may<br>
thereafter be defined. While typically, after oil is removed from the evaporator 103, it is not<br>
voluntarily replenished, a lower limit 160 of the operating regime defines, in a subsequent<br>
removal operation, a boundary beyond which it is not useful to extend. Complete oil removal is<br>
not only costly and directly inefficient, it may also result in reduced system efficiency. Likewise,<br>
when the oil level exceeds an upper boundary 161 of the operating regime, system efficiency<br>
drops and it is cost effective to service the chiller to restore optimum operation. Therefore, in a<br>
close loop feedback system, the distance between the lower boundary 160 and upper boundary<br>
will be much narrower than in a periodic maintenance system. The oil separator (e.g., partial<br>
distillation apparatus 105 or other type system) in a closed loop feedback system is itself<br>
typically less efficient than a larger system typically employed during periodic maintenance, so<br>
there are advantages to each type of arrangement.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Fig. 7A shows a block diagram of a first embodiment of a control system according to<br>
the present invention. In this system, refrigerant charge is controlled using an adaptive control<br>
200, with the control receiving refrigerant charge level 216 (from a level transmitter, e.g., Henry<br>
Valve Co., Melrose Park IL LCA series Liquid Level Column with E-9400 series Liquid Level<br>
Switches, digital output, or K-Tek Magnetostrictive Level Transmitters AT200 or AT600,<br>
analog output), optionally system power consumption (kWatt-hours), as well as thermodynamic<br>
parameters, including condenser and evaporator water temperature in and out, condenser and<br>
evaporator water flow rates and pressure, in and out, compressor RPM, suction and discharge<br><br>
pressure and temperature, and ambient pressure and temperature, all through a data acquisition<br>
system for sensor inputs 201. These variables are fed into the adaptive control 200 employing a<br>
nonlinear model of the system, based on neural network 203 technology. The variables are<br>
preprocessed to produce a set of derived variables from the input set, as well as to represent<br>
temporal parameters based on prior data sets. The neural network 203 evaluates the input data<br>
set periodically, for example every 30 seconds, and produces an output control signal 209 or set<br>
of signals. After the proposed control is implemented, the actual response is compared with a<br>
predicted response based on the internal model defined by the neural network 203 by an adaptive<br>
control update subsystem 204, and the neural network is updated 205 to reflect or take into<br>
account the "error". A further output 206 of the system, from a diagnostic portion 205, which<br>
may be integrated with the neural network or separate, indicates a likely error in either the<br>
sensors and network itself, or the plant being controlled.<br>
The controlled variable is, for example, the refrigerant charge in the system. In order to<br>
remove refrigerant, liquid refrigerant from the evaporator 211 is transferred to a storage vessel<br>
212 through a valve 210. In order to add refrigerant, gaseous refrigerant may be returned to the<br>
compressor 214 suction, controlled by valve 215, or liquid refrigerant pumped to the evaporator<br>
211. Refrigerant in the storage vessel 212 may be subjected to analysis and purification.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A second embodiment of the control system employs feedforward optimization control<br>
strategies, as shown in Fig. 7B. Fig. 7B shows a signal-flow block diagram of a computer-based<br>
feedforward optimizing control system. Process variables 220 are measured, checked for<br>
reliability, filtered, averaged, and stored in the computer database 222. A regulatory system 223<br>
is provided as a front line control to keep the process variables 220 at a prescribed and desired<br>
slate of values. The conditioned set of measured variables are compared in the regulatory system<br>
223 with the desired set points from operator 224A and optimization routine 224B. Errors<br>
detected are then used to generate control actions that are then transmitted as outputs 225 to final<br>
control elements in the process 221. Set points for the regulatory system 223 are derived either<br>
from operator input 224A or from outputs of the optimization routine 224B. Note that the<br>
optimizer 226 operates directly upon the model 227 in arriving at its optimal set-point slate<br>
224B. Also note that the model 227 is updated by means of a special routine 228 just prior to use<br>
by the optimizer 227. The feedback update feature ensures adequate mathematical process<br>
description in spite of minor instrumentation errors and, in addition, wili compensate for<br>
discrepancies arising from simplifying assumptions incorporated in the model 227. In this case,<br><br>
the controlled variable may be, for example, compressor speed, alone or in addition to refrigerant<br>
charge level.<br>
The input variables are, in this case, similar to those in Example 2, including refrigerant<br>
charge level, optionally system power consumption (kWatt-hours), as well as thermodynamic<br>
parameters, including condenser and evaporator water temperature in and out, condenser and<br>
evaporator water flow rates and pressure, in and out, compressor RPM, suction and discharge<br>
pressure and temperature, and ambient pressure and temperature.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
As shown in Fig. 7C, a control system 230 is provided which controls refrigerant charge<br>
level 231, compressor speed 232, and refrigerant oil concentration 233 in evaporator. Instead of<br>
providing a single complex model of the system, a number of simplified relationships are<br>
provided in a database 234, which segment the operational space of the system into a number of<br>
regions or planes based on sensor inputs. The sensitivity of the control system 230 to variations<br>
in inputs 235 is adaptively determined by the control during operation, in order to optimize<br>
energy efficiency.<br>
Data is also stored in the database 234 as to the filling density of the operational space;<br>
when the set of input parameters identifies a well populated region of the operational space, a<br>
rapid transition is effected to achieve the calculated most efficient output conditions. On the<br>
other hand, if the region of the operational space is poorly populated, the control 230 provides a<br>
slow, searching alteration of the outputs seeking to explore the operational space to determine<br>
the optimal output set. This searching procedure also serves to populate the space, so that the<br>
control 230 will avoid the naive strategy after a few encounters.<br>
In addition, for each region of the operational space, a statistical variability is determined.<br>
If the statistical variability is low, then the model for the region is deemed accurate, and<br>
continual searching of the local region is reduced. On the other hand, if the variability is high,<br>
the control 230 analyzes the input data set to determine a correlation between any available input<br>
235 and the system efficiency, seeking to improve the model for that region stored in the<br>
database 234. This correlation may be detected by searching the region through sensitivity<br>
testing of the input set with respect to changes in one or more of the outputs 231, 232, 233. For<br>
each region, preferably a linear model is constructed relating the set of input variables and the<br>
optima] output variables. Alternately, a relatively simple non-linear network, such as a neural<br>
network, may be employed.<br>
The operational regions, for example, segment the operational space into regions<br>
separated by 5% of refrigerant charge level, from -40% to +20% of design, oil content of<br>
evaporator by 0.5% from 0% to 10%, and compressor speed, from minimum to maximum in 10-<br>
100 increments. It is also possible to provide non-uniformly spaced regions, or even adaptively<br>
sized regions based on the sensitivity of the outputs to input variations at respective portions of<br>
the input space.<br>
The control system also provides a set of special modes for system startup and shutdown.<br>
These are distinct from the normal operational modes, in that energy efficiency is not generally a<br>
primary consideration during these transitions, and because other control issues may be<br>
considered important. These modes also provide options for control system initialization and<br>
fail-safe operation.<br>
It is noted that, since the required update time for the system is relatively long, the neural<br>
network calculations may be implemented serially on a general purpose computer, e.g., an Intel<br>
Pentium IV or Athlon XP processor running Windows XP or a real time operating system, and<br>
therefore specialized hardware (other than the data acquisition interface) is typically not<br>
necessary.<br>
It is preferred that the control system provide a diagnostic output 236 which "explains"<br>
the actions of the control, for example identifying, for any given control decision, the sensor<br>
inputs which had the greatest influence on the output state. In neural network systems, however,<br>
it is often not possible to completely rationalize an output. Further, where the system detects an<br>
abnormal state, either in the plant being controlled or the controller itself, it is preferred that<br>
information be communicated to an operator or service engineer. This may be by way of a<br>
stored log, visual or audible indicators, telephone or Internet telecommunications, control<br>
network or local area network communications, radio frequency communication, or the like. In<br>
many instances, where a serious condition is detected and where the plant cannot be fully<br>
deactivated, it is preferable to provide a "failsafe" operational mode until maintenance may be<br>
performed.<br>
The foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention has been<br>
presented for purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to<br>
limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, since many modifications and variations are<br>
possible in light of the above teaching. Some modifications have been described in the<br>
specifications, and others may occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.<br>
