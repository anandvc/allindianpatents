Each guide post is surrounded at its three sides by guide rollers which are attached to a central shaft and are placed in Rota table contact with the guide post so that as being guided through this Rota table contact the central shaft is moved up and down.<br>
Operation of the System<br>
The vehicle is driven into the entry section of the automated multilevel modular system for parking vehicles, and left over the cradle. The Driver comes out of the vehicle and leaves the vehicle. The sensor provided in the cradle measures the weight, height, width and length of the vehicle. If the size and other measure of the vehicle do not match with the specifications of the system, it will not accept the vehicle. If the specifications match with the system, then it accepts the vehicle. On acceptance a card is issued to the driver manually by the attendant. In this connection it may be noted that the issue of the card can also be made automatic by utilizing known computer operated systems. In that case an electronically encoded ID card will be issued.<br>
It is possible to incorporate into the system a motion sensor or (Close Circuit TV) CCTV which can be monitored by an attendant to ensure that no people, animals, inflammables or explosives are left in the vehicle.<br>
Once the card is issued, the shutter of the entry or exist section of the system closes the carousal (7) provided at the platform identifies the vacant places in the platform. The transfer mechanism (the pinion &amp; rack system) holds up the vehicle along with the cradle. The cradle, then, transfers the vehicle to the parking area where closer and suitable spaces are available. It may be noted that this operation can also be<br><br>
effected by employing a central computer for identifying efficiently and quickly the vacant parking slot for the vehicle in the rack.<br>
The vertical threaded telescopic shaft raises the vehicle to the appropriate level in the system and the cradle base elongates (affected by the pinion &amp; rack system) by pushing the vehicle in to the vacant slot and places the vehicle in the space.<br>
When the driver returns to pick up the vehicle, he presents the card to the attendant or to the automatic card reader. The attendant or the central computer then locates the vehicle parked in the system. The transfer mechanism (the pinion &amp; rack system) performs all the operations in the reverse and brings back the vehicle to the exit section for delivery.<br>
Within each parking slot, there is provision for considering various sizes and weight of the vehicle. Limit switches and proximity sensors provided in each rack ensure that vehicles are safely positioned without touching the walls or materials it surrounds or even the vehicles parked the next to it. Sophisticated fire detection and alarm system provided in each rack ensures the safety of vehicles within the total structure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the automated multilevel modular system for parking vehicles, consists of a pair of racks at the central areas of the construction with said racks being disposed one above the other with a space in between.<br>
The entry or exit section may be constructed at the ground level at one side of the system. At the entry or exit section a forward ground portion is formed at the same level as said ground level.<br>
CCTV equipment when provided in the system also ensures no unauthorized persons are allowed entry into the system so that the system is safe from theft and burglary.<br>
The automated control system of the present invention allows for efficient placing and usage of the parking slots. It is possible to provide "SMART CARDS for regular<br><br>
users, which allow for monthly billing for usage of the parking by providing appropriate means in the system. Short and long term parking can also be provided. Optionally, automatic servicing and air checking of the tyre and so on can also be provided.<br>
The entire system can works on a minimum power levels of only around 11KW? Backup generators can also be provided for operation during power failure.<br>
The system of the present invention can be fabricated using steel frame with steel or reinforced concrete slabs as per convenience. It may also be noted that the system can be fixed on the ground or can be made portable and fixed appropriately at the desired places.<br>
