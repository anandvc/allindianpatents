Methocarbamol	500 mg<br>
Nimesulide	100 mg<br>
MANUFACTURING PROCESS (Batch Size 1 Lakh Tablet)<br>
Step -1:      Manufacturing of the granules<br>
50 kg of Methocarbamol, 10 kg of Nimesulide, 5.0 kg of microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, 3.4 kg of starch were passed through a 40-mesh sieve and placed<br>
in a planetary mixer. The ambient temperature was maintained below 25<br>
degrees Celsius and the relative humidity below 60%. The mixer was run for<br>
25 minutes at 30 r.p.m. so that a homogenous mixture of the particles of<br>
active ingredients and the above said inert excipients resulted.<br>
0.60 kg of starch mixed with 5 Kg of purified water in a stainless steel [s.s.] tank under continuous stirring to obtain slurry. Simultaneously heat 10 kgs of purified water in a jacketed steam vessel till boiling. Add 4gms of methyl paraben and dissolve it with stirring. Add the above said slurry to this boiling purified water until the binder was completely dissolved in the solvent. The solution was then added to the planetary mixer containing the homogenous mixture of the particles of active molecules with the excipients.<br>
Wet mixing was then commenced for 20 minutes at 15 r.p.m. to obtain a wet<br>
homogenous mixture mass.<br>
The   wet homogenous mixture mass was milled, in a multimill fitted with 12<br>
mm perforated sieve to obtain granules of mesh size 8 to 12 mm.<br>

The granules were subjected to heated drying at a temperature of 50 to 60<br>
degrees Celsius in a tray drier for 6 hrs. The drying mass was raked during<br>
the process. The Loss on drying was 1.2%.<br>
The dry granules were sifted in an 18-mesh vibrosifter to obtain uniform sized<br>
granules.<br><br>

stearate. This sifted mass (except magnesium stearate) along with 0.5kg<br>
aspartame , 0.5 kg mixed fruit flavor and the dried granules were transferred<br>
to a double cone blender at temperature of 22 degrees Celsius and the mass<br>
was blended at speed of 30 r.p.m. for 25 minutes. 1.2 kg of magnesium<br>
stearate; was then added to the blender and further blending was done for 5<br>
minutes resulting in the lubricated dispersible tabletmass.<br>
Step - 3 : Compression<br>
This dispersible tabletmass was fed to hopper of a single rotary compression<br>
machine and the compression pressure was set at 7 kg/sq cm.<br>
1,00,000 Cores were obtained:<br>

Trials were conducted by administering the tablets of the above examples to patients suffering from spasmodic pain.    Patients were also administered<br><br>
nimesulide alone and separate tablets of nimesulide and methocarbamol. Significant results were obtained for the formulation of this invention over both nimesulide alone and the active ingredients administered separately. Unexpectedly, the relief was obtained significantly earlier [perceived to be at least 15 to 30 minutes earlier] but was more satisfactory [perceived to be at least 16.2% better]. In addition the single dosage form of the two active ingredients improved patient compliance as well as the cost of manufacture.<br><br>
