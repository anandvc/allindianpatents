Oxime ester photoinitiators with heteroaromatic groups<br>
The invention pertains to new oxime ester compounds, having specific heteroaromatic sub-stitutents, and their use as photoinitiators in photopolymerizable compositions.<br>
From US patent 3558309 it is known that certain oxime ester derivatives are photoinitiators. In US 4255513 oxime ester compounds are disclosed. EP 810595 discribes some oxime es¬ter compounds having electron-donating groups. US-A-2001012596 describes aldoxime or ketoxime ester compounds. From GB-A-2339571 and US 6485885 oxime ester compounds with OR-, SR- or NR2-substituents as well as corresponding photopolymerizable composi¬tions, are known. US 4202697 discloses acrylamino-substituted oxime esters. In JP 7-140658 A, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1969, 42(10), 2981-3, Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1975, 48(8), 2393-4, Han'guk Somyu Konghakhoechi 1990, 27(9), 672-85, Macromolecules, 1991, 24(15), 4322-7 and European Polymer Journal, 1970, 933-943 some aldoxime ester com¬pounds are described.<br>
In US 4590145 and JP 61-24558-A several benzophenone oxime ester compounds are dis¬closed. In Chemical Abstract No. 96:52526c, J. Chem. Eng. Data 9(3), 403-4 (1964), J. Chin. Chem. Soc. (Taipei) 41 (5) 573-8, (1994), JP 62-273259-A (= Chemical Abstract 109:83463w), JP 62-286961-A (= Derwent No. 88-025703/04), JP 62-201859-A (= Derwent No. 87-288481/41), JP 62-184056-A (= Derwent No. 87-266739/38), US 5019482 and J. of Photochemistry and Photobiology A 107, 261-269 (1997) some p-alkoxy-phenyl oxime ester compounds are described.<br>
In photopolymerization technology there still exists a need for highly reactive, easy to pre¬pare and easy to handle photoinitiators. For example, highly pigmented formulations are re¬quired for the high color quality property in color filter resist applications. With the increase of the pigment content, curing of color resists becomes more difficult. Hence, photoinitiators having higher sensitivity than the current initiation systems are required. In addition, such new photoinitiators must meet the high requirements of the industry regarding properties like, for example, thermal stability and storage stability.<br>

Examples are<br><br><br>
It is clear, that in the context of the present definitions and in view of the examples these groups may bear further substituents.<br>
Oxime esters of formulae I, II, III and IV are prepared by methods described in the literature, for example by reaction of the corresponding oximes with an acyl chloride or an anhydride in an inert solvent such as for example f-Butyi methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dimethyl-formamide in the presence of a base, for example triethylamine or pyridine, or in a basic sol¬vent such as pyridine.<br><br>
Such reactions are well known to those skilled in the art, and are generally carried out at temperatures of -15 to +50°C, preferably 0 to 25°C.<br>
The compounds of formulae II, III and IV can be obtained analogously by using the appropri¬ate oximes as starting materials:<br><br>
Ch1t Ch2, An, M, R2 and R2' have the meanings as given above.<br><br>
The oximes required as starting materials can be obtained by a variety of methods described in standard chemistry textbooks (for instance in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, 1992), or in specialized monographs, for example, S.R. Sandler &amp; W. Karo, Organic functional group preparations, Vol. 3, Academic Press. One of the most convenient methods is, for example, the reaction of aldehydes or ketones with hydroxylamine or its salt in polar solvents like ethanol or aqueous ethanol. In that case, a base such as sodium acetate or pyridine is added to control the pH of the reaction mixture. It is well known that the rate of the reaction is pH-dependent, and the base can be added at the beginning or continuously during the reaction. Basic solvents such as pyridine can also be used as base and/or solvent or cosolvent. The reaction temperature is generally the re-fluxing temperature of the mixture, usually about 60-120°C.<br>
Another convenient synthesis of oximes is the nitrosation of "active" methylene groups with nitrous acid or an alkyl nitrite. Both alkaline conditions, as described for example in Organic Syntheses coll. Vol. VI (J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1988), pp 199 and 840, and acidic condi¬tions, as described, for example, in Organic Synthesis coll. vol V, pp 32 and 373, coll. vol. Ill, pp 191 and 513, coll. vol.II, pp. 202, 204 and 363, are suitable for the preparation of the oxi¬mes used as starting materials in the invention. Nitrous acid is usually generated from so¬dium nitrite. The alkyl nitrite can be for example methyl nitrite, ethyl nitrite, isopropyl nitrite, butyl nitrite, or isoamyl nitrite.<br>
Every oxime ester group can exist in two configurations, (Z) or (E). It is possible to separate the isomers by conventional methods, but it is also possible to use the isomeric mixture as such as photoinitiating species. Therefore, the invention also relates to mixtures of configura-tional isomers of compounds of the formulae I, II, III and IV.<br>

The composition may comprise additionally to the photoinitiator (b) at least one further photo-initiator (c), and/or other additives (d).<br>
The unsaturated compounds (a) may include one or more olefinic double bonds. They may be of low (monomeric) or high (oligomeric) molecular mass. Examples of monomers contain¬ing a double bond are alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or amino acrylates, or alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or amino methacrylates, for example methyl, ethyl, butyl, 2-ethylhexyl or 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate,<br><br>
isobornyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or ethyl methacrylate. Silicone acrylates are also ad¬vantageous. Other examples are acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-substituted (meth)acrylamides, vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers such as isobutyl vinyl ether, styrene, alkyl- and halostyrenes, N-vinylpyrrolidone, vinyl chloride or vinylidene chlo¬ride.<br>
Examples of monomers containing two or more double bonds are the diacrylates of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, hexamethylene glycol or of bisphenol A, and 4,4-bis(2-acryl-oyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol tria-crylate or tetraacrylate, vinyl acrylate, divinylbenzene, divinyl succinate, diallyl phthalate, tri-allyl phosphate, triallyl isocyanurate or tris(2-acryloylethyl) isocyanurate.<br>
Examples of polyunsaturated compounds of relatively high molecular mass (oligomers) are acrylated epoxy resins, polyesters containing acrylate-, vinyl ether- or epoxy-groups, and also polyurethanes and polyethers. Further examples of unsaturated oligomers are unsatu¬rated polyester resins, which are usually prepared from maleic acid, phthalic acid and one or more diols and have molecular weights of from about 500 to 3000. In addition it is also pos¬sible to employ vinyl ether monomers and oligomers, and also maleate-terminated oligomers with polyester, polyurethane, polyether, polyvinyl ether and epoxy main chains. Of particular suitability are combinations of oligomers which carry vinyl ether groups and of polymers as described in WO 90/01512. However, copolymers of vinyl ether and maleic acid-functionaliz-ed monomers are also suitable. Unsaturated oligomers of this kind can also be referred to as prepolymers.<br>
Particularly suitable examples are esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and polyols or polyepoxides, and polymers having ethylenically unsaturated groups in the chain or in side groups, for example unsaturated polyesters, polyamides and polyurethanes and copolymers thereof, polymers and copolymers containing (meth)acrylic groups in side chains, and also mixtures of one or more such polymers.<br>
Examples of unsaturated carboxylic acids are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, ita-conic acid, cinnamic acid, and unsaturated fatty acids such as linolenic acid or oleic acid. Acrylic and methacrylic acid are preferred.<br><br>
Suitable polyols are aromatic and, in particular, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyols. Ex¬amples of aromatic polyols are hydroquinone, 4,4,-dihydroxydiphenyl, 2,2-di(4-hydroxyphe-nyl)propane, and also novolaks and resols. Examples of polyepoxides are those based on the abovementioned polyols, especially the aromatic polyols, and epichlorohydrin. Other suitable polyols are polymers and copolymers containing hydroxyl groups in the polymer chain or in side groups, examples being polyvinyl alcohol and copolymers thereof or polyhy-droxyalkyl methacrylates or copolymers thereof. Further polyols which are suitable are oligo-esters having hydroxyl end groups.<br>
Examples of aliphatic and cycloaliphatic polyols are alkylenediols having preferably 2 to 12 C atoms, such as ethylene glycol, 1,2- or 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-butanediol, pen-tanediol, hexanediol, octanediol, dodecanediol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glcyol, poly¬ethylene glycols having molecular weights of preferably from 200 to 1500, 1,3-cyclopen-tanediol, 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-dihydroxymethylcyclohexane, glycerol, tris(p-hydroxyethyl)amine, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and sorbitol.<br>
The polyols may be partially or completely esterified with one carboxylic acid or with different unsaturated carboxylic acids, and in partial esters the free hydroxyl groups may be modified, for example etherified or esterified with other carboxylic acids.<br>
Examples of esters are:<br>
trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimeth-acry-late, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacryiate, triethylene gly¬col dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol diacrylate, dipentaerythritol triacry¬late, dipentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate, dipentaerythritol hexa-acrylate, tripentaerythritol octaacrylate, pentaerythritol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol trimeth¬acrylate, dipentaerythritol dimethacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, tripen-ta-erythritol octamethacrylate, pentaerythritol diitaconate, dipentaerythritol tris-itaconate, dipen¬taerythritol pentaitaconate, dipentaerythritol hexaitaconate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-bu-tanediol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diitaconate, sorbitol triacryl¬ate, sorbitol tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol-modified triacrylate, sorbitol tetra methacrylate, sor¬bitol pentaacrylate, sorbitol hexaacrylate, oligoester acrylates and methacrylates, glycerol<br><br>

Also suitable as components (a) are the amides of identical or different, unsaturated car-boxylic acids with aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic polyamines having preferably 2 to 6, especially 2 to 4, amino groups. Examples of such polyamines are ethylenediamine, 1,2- or 1,3-propyIenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-or 1,4-butylenediamine, 1,5-pentylenediamine, 1,6-hexyle-nediamine, octylenediamine, dodecylenediamine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, isophoronediami-ne, phenylenediamine, bisphenylenediamine, di-U-aminoethyl ether, diethylenetriamine, triet-hylenetetramine, di(ft-aminoethoxy)- or di(ft-aminopropoxy)ethane. Other suitable polyamin¬es are polymers and copolymers, preferably with additional amino groups in the side chain, and oligoamides having amino end groups. Examples of such unsaturated amides are meth-ylenebisacrylamide, 1,6-hexamethylenebisacrylamide, diethylenetriaminetrismethacrylamide, bis(methacrylamidopropoxy)ethane, (l-methacrylamidoethyl methacrylate and N[(ft-hydroxy-ethoxy )ethyl]acrylamide.<br>
Suitable unsaturated polyesters and polyamides are derived, for example, from maleic acid and from diols or diamines. Some of the maleic acid can be replaced by other dicarboxylic acids. They can be used together with ethylenically unsaturated comonomers, for example styrene. The polyesters and polyamides may also be derived from dicarboxylic acids and from ethylenically unsaturated diols or diamines, especially from those with relatively long chains of, for example 6 to 20 C atoms. Examples of polyurethanes are those composed of saturated or unsaturated diisocyanates and of unsaturated or, respectively, saturated diols.<br>
Polymers with (meth)acrylate groups in the side chain are likewise known. They may, for ex¬ample, be reaction products of epoxy resins based on novolaks with (meth)acrylic acid, or may be homo- or copolymers of vinyl alcohol or hydroxyalkyl derivatives thereof which are esterified with (meth)acrylic acid, or may be homo- and copolymers of (meth)acrylates which are esterified with hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates.<br>
Other suitable polymers with acrylate or methacrylate groups in the side chains are, for ex¬ample, solvent soluble or alkaline soluble polyimide precursors, for example poly(amic acid ester) compounds, having the photopolymerizable side groups either attached to the back¬bone or to the ester groups in the molecule, i.e. according to EP 624826. Such oligomers or<br><br>
polymers can be formulated with the new photoinitiators and optionally reactive diluents, like polyfunctional (meth)acrylates in order to prepare highly sensitive polyimide precursor re¬sists.<br>
The photopolymerizable compounds can be used alone or in any desired mixtures. It is pre¬ferred to use mixtures of polyol (meth)acrylates.<br>
Examples of the component (a) are also polymers or oligomers having at least two ethyl¬enically unsaturated groups and at least one carboxyl function within the molecule structure, such as a resin obtained by the reaction of a saturated or unsaturated polybasic acid anhy¬dride with a product of the reaction of an epoxy compound and an unsaturated monocarbox-ylic acid, for example, photosensitive compounds as described in JP 6-1638 and JP 10-301276 and commercial products such as EB9696, UCB Chemicals; KAYARAD TCR1025, Nippon Kayaku Co.,LTD., or an addition product formed between a carboxyl group-containing resin and an unsaturated compound having an a,p-unsaturated double bond and an epoxy group (for example, ACA200M, Daicel Industries, Ltd.).<br>
Preferred is a photopolymerizable composition comprising as component (a) a compound having at least two ethylenically unsaturated bonds and at least one carboxylic acid group in the molecule.<br>
As diluent, a mono- or multi-functional ethylenically unsaturated compound, or mixtures of several of said compounds, can be included in the above composition up to 70 % by weight based on the solid portion of the composition.<br>
The unsaturated compounds (a) can also be used as a mixture with non-photopolymerizable, film-forming components. These may, for example, be physically drying polymers or soluti¬ons thereof in organic solvents, for instance nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. They may also, however, be chemically and/or thermally curable (heat-curable) resins, examples being polyisocyanates, polyepoxides and melamine resins, as well as polyimide precursors. The use of heat-curable resins at the same time is important for use in systems known as hybrid systems, which in a first stage are photopolymerized and in a second stage are crosslinked by means of thermal aftertreatment.<br><br>
The invention also provides compositions comprising as component (a) at least one ethyl-enically unsaturated photopolymerizable compound which is emulsified or dissolved in water. Many variants of such radiation-curable aqueous prepolymer dispersions are commercially available. A prepolymer dispersion is understood as being a dispersion of water and at least one prepolymer dispersed therein. The concentration of water in these systems is, for ex¬ample, from 5 to 80% by weight, in particular from 30 to 60% by weight. The concentration of the radiation-curable prepolymer or prepolymer mixture is, for example, from 95 to 20% by weight, in particular from 70 to 40% by weight. In these compositions the sum of the per¬centages given for water and prepolymer is in each case 100, with auxiliaries and additives being added in varying quantities depending on the intended use.<br>
The radiation-curable, film-forming prepolymers which are dispersed in water and are often also dissolved are aqueous prepolymer dispersions of mono- or polyfunctional, ethylenically unsaturated prepolymers which are known per se, can be initiated by free radicals and have for example a content of from 0.01 to 1.0 mol of polymerizable double bonds per 100 g of prepolymer and an average molecular weight of, for example, at least 400, in particular from 500 to 10*000. Prepolymers with higher molecular weights, however, may also be consider¬ed depending on the intended application. Use is made, for example, of polyesters contain¬ing polymerizable C-C double bonds and having an acid number of not more than 10, of po-lyethers containing polymerizable C-C double bonds, of hydroxyl-containing reaction pro¬ducts of a polyepoxide, containing at least two epoxide groups per molecule, with at least one a,R-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, of polyurethane (meth)acrylates and of a-crylic copolymers which contain a,(l-ethylenically unsaturated acrylic radicals, as are des¬cribed in EP 12339. Mixtures of these prepolymers can likewise be used. Also suitable are the polymerizable prepolymers described in EP 33896, which are thioether adducts of po¬lymerizable prepolymers having an average molecular weight of at least 600, a carboxyl group content of from 0.2 to 15% and a content of from 0.01 to 0.8 mol of polymerizable C-C double bonds per 100 g of prepolymer. Other suitable aqueous dispersions, based on spe¬cific alkyl (meth)acrylate polymers, are described in EP 41125, and suitable waterdispersible, radiation-curable prepolymers of urethane acrylates can be found in DE 2936039. Further additives which may be included in these radiation-curable aqueous prepolymer dis¬persions are dispersion auxiliaries, emulsifiers, antioxidants, e.g. 2,2-thiobis(4-methyl-6-t-butylphenol) or 2,6-di-t-butylphenol, light stabilizers, dyes, pigments, fillers, such as glass or alumina, for example talc, gypsum, silicic acid, rutile, carbon black, zinc oxide, iron oxides, reaction accelerators, levelling agents, lubricants, wetting agents, thickeners, flatting agents,<br><br>
antifoams and other auxiliaries customary in paint technology. Suitable dispersion auxiliaries are water-soluble organic compounds which are of high molecular mass and contain polar groups, examples being polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidone or cellulose ethers. Emulsifi-ers which can be used are nonionic emulsifiers and, if desired, ionic emulsifiers as well.<br>
In certain cases it may be of advantage to use mixtures of two or more of the novel photoiniti-ators. It is of course also possible to use mixtures with known photoinitiators (c), for example mixtures with camphor quinone, benzophenone, benzophenone derivatives, acetophenone, acetophenone derivatives, for example a-hydroxycycloalkyl phenyl ketones or 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propanone, dialkoxyacetophenones, a-hydroxy-or a-aminoacetophenones, e.g. (4-methylthiobenzoyl)-1 -methyl-1 -morpholinoethane, (4-morpholinobenzoyl)-1 -benzyl-1 -dimethylaminopropane, 4-aroyl-1,3-dioxolanes, benzoin alkyl ethers and benzil ketals, e.g. dimethyl benzil ketal, phenylglyoxalic esters and derivatives thereof, dimeric phenylglyoxalic esters, diacetyl, peresters, e.g. benzophenone tetracarboxylic peresters as described for ex¬ample in EP 126541, monoacyl phosphine oxides, e.g. (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)diphenylphos-phine oxide, bisacylphosphine oxides, bis(2,6-dimethoxy-benzoyl)-(2,4,4-trimethyl-pentyl)-phosphine oxide, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoy!)-phenylphosphine oxide, bis(2,4,6-trimethylben-zoyl)-2,4-dipentoxyphenylphosphine oxide, trisacylphosphine oxides, halomethyltriazines, e.g. 2-[2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-vinyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-(4-methoxy-phen-ylH^-bis-trichloromethyKl^^ltriazine, 2-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[I.S^ltriazine, 2-methyl-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-(4-N,N-di(ethoxycarbonyl-methyl)aminophenyl)-4,6-bis(trichloromethylH1,3,5]triazine, 2-(4-methoxy-naphthyl)-4,6-bis-trichIoromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1 .S.Sltriazine, 2-[2-[4-(pentyloxy)phenyl]ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1I3,5]triazine, 2-[2-(3-methyl-2-fur-anyl)-ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-[2-(5-methyl-2-furanyl)-ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-[2-(2,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichlorometh-yl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-[2-(2-methoxy-phenyl)ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-[2-[4-isopropyloxy-phenyl]-ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-[2-(3-chloro-4-meth-oxy-phenyl)ethenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, 2-[2-bromo-4-N,N-di(ethoxycarb-onylmethyl)amino-phenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1t3,5]triazine, 2-[2-chloro-4-N,N-di(ethoxy-carbonylmethyOamino-phenylj^^-bis-trichloromethyKI.S.Sltriazine, 2-[3-bromo-4-N,N-di-(ethoxycarbonylmethylJamino-phenyH.e-bis-trichloromethyKI.S.Sltriazine, 2-[3-chloro-4-N,N-di(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)amino-phenyl]-4,6-bis-trichloromethyl-[1,3,5]triazine, or other halomethyl-triazines as described for example in G.Buhr, R. Dammel and C. Lindley Polym.<br><br>
Mater. Sci. Eng. 61,269 (1989), and EP 0262788; halomethyl-oxazol photoinitiators, such as described in US 4371606 and US 4371607; 1,2-disulfones, such as described in E. A. Bart-mann, Synthesis 5, 490 (1993); hexaarylbisimidazole, and hexaarylbisimidazole / coinitiators systems, e.g. ortho-chlorohexaphenyl-bisimidazole combined with 2-mercaptobenzthiazole, bisacridine derivatives, e.g. 1,7-bis(9-acridinyl)heptane, ferrocenium compounds, or tita-nocenes, e.g. bis(cyclopentadienyl)-bis(2,6-difluoro-3-pyrryl-phenyl)titanium. Further, borate salts can be employed as additional photoinitiators.<br>
Where the novel photoinitiator systems are employed in hybrid systems, use is made, in ad¬dition to the novel free-radical hardeners, of cationic photoinitiators, of peroxide compounds, such as benzoyl peroxide (other suitable peroxides are described in US Patent 4950581 co¬lumn 19, lines 17-25), of aromatic sulfonium-, phosphonium- or iodonium salts as described for example in US Patent 4950581, column 18, line 60 to column 19, line 10 or cyclopenta-dienyl-arene-iron(ll) complex salts, for example (ri6-iso-propylbenzene)(*n5-cyclopentadienyl)-iron(ll) hexafluorophosphate, as well as oxime sulfonic acid esters, as are, for example des¬cribed in EP 780729. Also pyridinium and (iso)quinolinium salts as described e.g. in EP 497531 and EP 441232 may be used in combination with the new photoinitiators.<br>
The new photoinitiators, either alone or in mixtures with other known photoinitiators and sensitizers, can be used also in the form of a dispersion or emulsion in water or aqueous solutions.<br>
Interesting also are compositions comprising besides the compound of formula I, II, III or IV at least one a-aminoketone, in particular (4-methylthiobenzoyl)-1-methyl-1-morpholino-ethane.<br>
The photopolymerizable compositions generally comprise 0.05 to 25 % by weight, preferably 0.01 to 10 % by weight, in particular 0.01 to 5 % by weight of the photoinitiator, based on the solid composition. The amount refers to the sum of all photoinitiators added, if mixtures of initiators are employed. Accordingly, the amount either refers to the photoinitiator (b) or the photoinitiators (b) +(c).<br>
In addition to the photoinitiator the photopolymerizable mixtures may include various additi¬ves (d). Examples of these are thermal inhibitors, which are intended to prevent premature polyme/ization, examples being hydroquinone, hydroquinone derivatives, p-methoxyphenol,<br><br>
(i-naphthol or sterically hindered phenols, such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol In order to in¬crease the stability on storage in the dark it is possible, for example, to use copper compo¬unds, such as copper naphthenate, stearate or octoate, phosphorus compounds, for ex¬ample triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine, triethyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite or tri-benzyl phosphite, quaternary ammonium compounds, for example tetramethylammonium chloride or trimethylbenzylammonium chloride, or hydroxylamine derivatives, for example N-diethylhydroxylamine. To exclude atmospheric oxygen during the polymerization it is pos¬sible to add paraffin or similar wax-like substances which, being of inadequate solubility in the polymer, migrate to the surface in the beginning of polymerization and form a transparent surface layer which prevents the ingress of air. It is also possible to apply an oxygen-imper¬meable layer on top of the coating, for example poly(vinylalcohol-co-vinylacetate). Light sta¬bilizers which can be added in a small quantity are UV absorbers, for example those of the hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole, hydroxyphenyl-benzophenone, oxalamide or hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type. These compounds can be used individually or in mixtures, with or without sterically hindered amines (HALS). Examples of such UV absorbers and light stabilizers are<br>

A photopolymerizable composition, comprising as further additive (d) a photosensitizer com¬pound selected from the group consisting of benzophenone and its derivatives, thioxanthone and its derivatives, anthraquinone and its derivatives, or coumarin derivatives is preferred.<br>
The curing process can be assisted by adding photosensitizers, in particular, in compositions which are pigmented (for example with titanium dioxide), and also by adding a component which under thermal conditions forms free radicals, for example an azo compound such as 2,2'-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), a triazene, diazo sulfide, pentazadiene or a peroxy compound, for instance a hydroperoxide or peroxycarbonate, for example t-butyl hy¬droperoxide, as described for example in EP 245639.<br>

In order to cure thick and pigmented coatings it is appropriate to add glass microspheres or pulverized glass fibres, as described for example in US 5013768.<br>
The choice of additive(s) (d) is made depending on the field of application and on properties required for this field. The additives described above are customary in the art and according¬ly are added in amounts which are usual in the respective application.<br>
Binders (e) as well can be added to the novel compositions. This is particularly expedient when the photopolymerizable compounds are liquid or viscous substances. The quantity of binder may, for example, be 2-98 %, preferably 5-95 % and especially 20-90 %, by weight relative to the overall solids content. The choice of binder is made depending on the field of application and on properties required for this field, such as the capacity for development in aqueous and organic solvent systems, adhesion to substrates and sensitivity to oxygen.<br>
Examples of suitable binders are polymers having a molecular weight of about 2'000 to 2'000'000, preferably 5'000 to VOOO'OOO. Examples of alkali developable binders are acrylic polymer having carboxylic acid function as a pendant group, such as conventionally known copolymers obtained by copolymerizing an ethylenic unsaturated carboxylic acid such as (meth)acrylic acid, 2-carboxyethyl (meth)acrylic acid, 2-carboxypropyI (meth)acryiic acid ita-conic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and ocarboxypolycaprolactone mono(meth)acrylate, with one or more monomers selected from esters of (meth)acrylic acid, such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)-acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hy-droxypropyl (meth)acrylate, glycerol mono(meth)acrylate, tricyclo[5.2.1.02,6]decan-8-yl (meth)acrylate, glycidyl (meth)acrylate, 2-methylglycidyl (meth)acrylate, 3,4-epoxybutyl (meth)acrylate, 6,7-epoxyheptyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-diethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-diethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylamlno-propyl (meth)acrylate; vinyl aromatic compounds, such as styrene, a-methylstyrene, vinyl-toluene, p-chlorostyrene, vinylbenzyl glycidyl ether, 4-vinylpyridine; amide type unsaturated compounds, (meth)acrylamide diacetone acrylamide, N-methylolacrylamide, N-butoxymeth-acrylamide N,N-dimethyiacrylamide, N,N-dimethylaminopropyl (meth)acrylamide; and poly-olefin type compounds, such as butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene and the like; methacryloni-trile, methyl isopropenyl ketone, mono-2-[(meth)acryloyloxy]ethyl succinate, N-phenylmalel-mide, maleic anhydride, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl pivalate, vinylpyrrolidone, N,N-<br><br>
dimethylaminoethyl vinyl ether, diallylamine, polystyrene macromonomer, or polymethyl (meth)acrylate macromonomer. Examples of copolymers are copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and with styrene or substituted styrene, phenolic resins, for example novolak, (poly)hydroxystyrene, and copolymers of hydroxysty-rene with alkyl acrylates, acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid. Preferable examples of co¬polymers are copolymers of methyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid, copolymers of benzyl me-thacrylate/methacrylic acid, copolymers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid, copolymers of benzyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/styrene, copolymers of benzyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/hydroxyethyl methacrylate, copolymers of methyl methacry-late/butyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/styrene, copolymers of methyl methacrylate/benzyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid/hydroxyphenyl methacrylate. Examples of solvent develop¬able binder polymers are poly(alkyl methacrylates), poly(alkyl acrylates), poly(benzylmeth-acrylate-co-hydroxyethylmethacrylate-co-methacrylic acid), poly(benzylmethacrylate-co-methacrylic acid); cellulose esters and cellulose ethers, such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetobutyrate, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose; polyvinylbutyral, polyvinylformal, cyclized rub¬ber, polyethers such as polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide and polytetrahydrofuran; polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, chlorinated polyolefins, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride/vinylidene copolymers, copolymers of vinylidene chloride with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate, copoly(ethylene/vinyl acetate), polymers such as polycaprolactam and poly(hexamethylene adipamide), and polyesters such as poly(ethylene glycol terephtalate) and poly(hexamethylene glycol succinate) and polyimide binder resins.<br>
The polyimide binder resin in the present invention can either be a solvent soluble polyimide or a polyimide precursor, for example, a poly(amic acid).<br>
Preferred is a photopolymerizable composition, comprising as binder polymer (e), a copoly¬mer of methacrylate and methacrylic acid.<br>
Interesting further are polymeric binder components as described e.g. in JP 10-171119-A, in particular for use in color filters.<br>
The photopolymerizable compositions can be used for various purposes, for example as printing ink, e.g. screen printing inks, inks for offset- or flexo printing, as a clear finish, as a white or colored finish, for example for wood or metal, as powder coating, as a coating ma¬terial, inter alia for paper, wood, metal or plastic, as a daylight-curable coating for the mar-<br><br>
king of buildings and roadmarking, for photographic reproduction techniques, for holographic recording materials, for image recording techniques or to produce printing plates which can be developed with organic solvents or with aqueous alkalis, for producing masks for screen printing, as dental filling compositions, as adhesives, as pressure-sensitive adhesives, as laminating resins, as etch resists, solder resists, electroplating resists, or permanent resists, both liquid and dry films, as photostructurable dielectric, for printed circuit boards and elec¬tronic circuits, as resists to manufacture color filters for a variety of display applications or to generate structures in the manufacturing process of plasma-display panels and electroluminescence displays, (as for example described in US 5853446, EP 863534, JP 09-244230-A, JP 10-62980-A, JP 08-171863-A, US 5840465, EP 855731, JP 05-271576-A, JP 05-67405-A) for the production of optical switches, optical lattices (interference lattice), light circuits, for producing three-dimensional articles by mass curing (UV curing in transparent moulds) or by the stereolithography technique, as is described, for example, in US 4575330, to produce composite materials (for example styrenic polyesters, which may, if desired, contain glass fibres and/or other fibres and other auxiliaries) and other thick-layered compositions, for coating or sealing electronic components and integrated circuits, or as coatings for optical fibres, or for producing optical lenses, e.g. contact lenses or Fresnel lenses. The compositions according to the invention are further suitable for the production of medical equipment, auxiliaries or implants. Further, the compositions according to the invention are suitable for the preparation of gels with thermotropic properties, as for example described in DE 19700064 and EP 678534.<br>
The photoinitiators of the present invention are also suitable for the composition of the holo¬graphic data storage system. The holographic data storage system is preferably comprised of a matrix network of low-refractive index matrix precursors and high-refractive index photo-polymerizable monomers. The media matrix is formed by in-situ polymerization which yields as cross-linked network in the presence of the photopolymerizable monomers which remain "dissolved" and unreacted. The matrix containing unreacted, photopolymerizable monomers can also be formed by other means, for example by using a solid-resin matrix material in which the photoreactive, liquid monomer is homogeneously distributed. Then, monochro¬matic exposure generates the holographic pattern, which according to the light intensity dis¬tribution, polymerizes the photoreactive monomers in the solid pre-formed matrix. The unre¬acted monomers (where light intensity was at a minimum) diffuse through the matrix, produc¬ing a modulation of the refractive index that is determined by the difference between the re-<br><br>
fractive indices of the monomer and the matrix and by the relative volume fraction of the monomer. The thickness of the recording layer is in the range of several micrometers up to a thickness of one millimeter. Because of such thick holographic data storage layers it is re¬quired that the photoinitiator combines high photoreactivity with low absorbance, in order to render the layer transparent at the laser wavelength to assure that the extent of photopoly-merization is as little as possible dependent on the exposure depth into the recording layer.<br>
The novel photoinitiators may additionally be employed as initiators for emulsion polymeriza¬tions, pearl polymerizations or suspension polymerizations, as polymerization initiators for fixing ordered states of liquid-crystalline monomers and oligomers, or as initiators for fixing dyes on organic materials.<br>
In coating materials, use is frequently made of mixtures of a prepolymer with polyunsaturated monomers, which may additionally include a monounsaturated monomer as well. It is the prepolymer here which primarily dictates the properties of the coating film, and by varying it the skilled worker is able to influence the properties of the cured film. The polyunsaturated monomer functions as a crosslinking agent which renders the film insoluble. The mo¬nounsaturated monomer functions as a reactive diluent, which is used to reduce the viscosity without the need to employ a solvent.<br>
Unsaturated polyester resins are usually used in two-component systems together with a monounsaturated monomer, preferably with styrene. For photoresists, specific one-compo¬nent systems are often used, for example polymaleimides, polychalcones or polyimides, as described in DE 2308830.<br>
The novel photoinitiators and mixtures thereof can also be used for the polymerization of ra¬diation-curable powder coatings. The powder coatings can be based on solid resins and mo¬nomers containing reactive double bonds, for example maleates, vinyl ethers, acrylates, acrylamides and mixtures thereof. A free-radically UV-curable powder coating can be formu¬lated by mixing unsaturated polyester resins with solid acrylamides (for example methyl me-thylacrylamidoglycolate) and a novel free-radical photoinitiator, such formulations being as described, for example, in the paper "Radiation Curing of Powder Coating", Conference Pro¬ceedings, Radtech Europe 1993 by M. Wittig and Th. Gohmann. The powder coatings can also contain binders, as are described, for example, in DE 4228514 and in EP 636669. Free-radically UV-curable powder coatings can also be formulated by mixing unsaturated polyes-<br><br>
ter resins with solid acrylates, methacrylates or vinyl ethers and with a novel photoinitiator (or photoinitiator mixture). The powder coatings may also comprise binders as are described, for example, in DE 4228514 and in EP 636669. The UV-curable powder coatings may addi¬tionally comprise white or coloured pigments. For example, preferably rutiletitanium dioxide can be employed in concentrations of up to 50% by weight in order to give a cured powder coating of good hiding power. The procedure normally comprises electrostatic or tribostatic spraying of the powder onto the substrate, for example metal or wood, melting of the powder by heating, and, after a smooth film has formed, radiation-curing of the coating with ultravio¬let and/or visible light, using for example medium-pressure mercury lamps, metal halide lamps or xenon lamps. A particular advantage of the radiation-curable powder coatings over their heat-curable counterparts is that the flow time after melting the powder particles can be delayed in order to ensure the formation of a smooth, high-gloss coating. In contrast to heat-curable systems, radiation-curable powder coatings can be formulated to melt at lower tem¬peratures without the unwanted effect of shortening their lifetime. For this reason, they are also suitable as coatings for heat-sensitive substrates, for example wood or plastics. In addi¬tion to the novel photoinitiator systems, the powder coating formulations may also include UV absorbers. Appropriate examples are listed above in sections 1.-8.<br>
The compositions comprising the novel photoinitiators can, for example, also be used as re¬pair materials and as putty materials.<br>
The novel photocurable compositions are suitable, for example, as coating materials for sub¬strates of all kinds, for example wood, textiles, paper, ceramics, glass, plastics such as poly¬esters, polyethylene terephthalate, polyolefins or cellulose acetate, especially in the form of films, and also metals such as Al, Cu, Ni, Fe, Zn, Mg or Co and GaAs, Si or Si02 to which it is intended to apply a protective layer or, by means of imagewise exposure, to generate an image.<br>
The novel radiation-sensitive compositions further find application as negative resists, having a very high sensitivity to light and being able to be developed in an aqueous alkaline medium without swelling. They are suitable for the production of printing forms for relief printing, planographic printing, photogravure or of screen printing forms, for the production of relief copies, for example for the production of texts in braille, for the production of stamps, for use in chemical milling or as a microresist in the production of integrated circuits. The composi¬tions further may be used as photopatternable dielectric layer or coating, encapsulating ma-<br><br>
terial and isolating coating in the production of computer chips, printed boards and other electric or electronic components. The possible layer supports, and the processing condi¬tions of the coating substrates, are just as varied.<br>
The novel composition also relates to a photosensitive thermosetting resin composition and a method of forming a solder resist pattern by the use thereof, and more particularly relates to a novel photosensitive thermosetting resin composition useful as materials for the production of printed circuit boards, the precision fabrication of metallic articles, the etching of glass and stone articles, the relief of plastic articles, and the preparation of printing plates and particu¬larly useful as a solder resist for printed circuit boards and to a method of forming a solder resist pattern by the steps of exposing a layer of the resin composition selectively to an ac¬tinic ray through a photomask having a pattern and developing the unexposed part of the layer.<br>
The solder resist is a substance which is used during the soldering of a given part to a printed circuit board for the purpose of preventing molten solder from adhering to irrelevant portions and protecting circuits. It is, therefore, required to possess such properties as high adhesion, insulation resistance, resistance to soldering temperature, resistance to solvents, resistance to alkalis, resistance to acids, and resistance to plating.<br>
Because the photocurable compositions according to the invention have a good thermal sta¬bility and are sufficiently resistant to inhibition by oxygen, they are particularly suitable for the production of color filters or color mosaic systems, such as described, for example, in EP 320 264. Color filters usually are employed in the manufacturing of LCD's, projection systems and image sensors. The color filters can be used, for example, for display and image scan¬ner in television receivers, video monitors or computers, in flat panel display technology etc..<br>
The color filters usually are prepared by forming red, green and blue pixels and a black ma¬trix on a glass substrate. In these processes photocurable compositions according to the in¬vention can be employed. A particularly preferred method of use comprises adding of the coloring matters, dyes and pigments of red, green and blue colors to the light-sensitive resin composition of the present invention, coating of the substrate with the composition, drying of the coating with a short heat treatment, patternwise exposure of the coating to actinic radia¬tion and subsequent development of the pattern in an aqueous alkaline developer solution<br><br>
and optionally a heat treatment. Thus, by subsequently applying a red, green and blue pig¬mented coating, in any desired order, on top of each other with this process a color filter layer with red, green and blue color pixels can be produced.<br>
The development is carried out by washing out the areas which were not polymerized with a suitable alkali developing solution. This process is repeated to form the image having plural colors.<br>
In the light-sensitive resin composition of the present invention, with a process in which at least one or more picture elements are formed on a transparent substrate and then an expo¬sure is given from a side of the transparent substrate, on which the above picture elements are not formed, the above picture elements can be utilized as a light-shielding mask. In this case, for example, in the case where an overall exposure is given, a position adjustment of a mask gets unnecessary and a concern on a position slippage thereof is removed. And, it is possible to cure all of the part on which the above picture elements are not formed. Further, in this case, it is possible as well to develop and remove a part of the portion on which the above picture elements are not formed by using partially a light-shielding mask.<br>
Since in either case, no gap is formed between the picture elements which are formed for¬merly and those which are formed later, the composition of the present invention is suitable for, for example, a forming material for a color filter. To be concrete, the coloring matters, dyes and pigments of red, green and blue colors are added to the light-sensitive resin com¬position of the present invention, and the processes for forming an image are repeated to form the picture elements of red, green and blue colors. Then, the light-sensitive resin com¬position to which, for example, the black coloring materials, dyes and pigments are added is provided on an overall face. An overall exposure (or a partial exposure via a light-shielding mask) can be provided thereon to form the picture elements of a black color all over the spaces (or all but a partial region of the light-shielding mask) between the picture elements of red, green and blue colors.<br>
In addition to a process in which the light-sensitive resin composition is coated on a substrate and dried, the light-sensitive resin composition of the present invention can be used as well for a layer transfer material. That is, the light-sensitive resin composition is layer-wise pro¬vided directly on a temporary support, preferably on a polyethylene terephthalate film, or on a<br><br>
polyethylene terephthalate film on which an oxygen-shielding layer and a peeling layer or the peeling layer and the oxygen-shielding layer are provided. Usually, a removable cover sheet made of a synthetic resin is laminated thereon for a protection in handling. Further, there can be applied as well a layer structure in which an alkali soluble thermoplastic resin layer and an intermediate layer are provided on a temporary support and further a light-sensitive resin composition layer is provided thereon (JP 5-173320-A).<br>
The above cover sheet is removed in use and the light-sensitive resin composition layer is laminated on a permanent support. Subsequently, peeling is carried out between those layer and a temporary support when an oxygen-shielding layer and a peeling layer are provided, between the peeling layer and the oxygen-shielding layer when the peeling layer and the oxygen-shielding layer are provided, and between the temporary support and the light-sensitive resin composition layer when either the peeling layer or the oxygen-shielding layer is not provided, and the temporary support is removed.<br>
A metal support, glass, ceramics, and a synthetic resin film can be used as a support for a color filter. Glass and a synthetic resin film which is transparent and have an excellent di¬mension stability is particularly preferred.<br>
The thickness of the light-sensitive resin composition layer is usually 0.1 to 50 micrometers, in particular 0.5 to 5 micrometers.<br>
A diluted aqueous solution of an alkaline substance can be used as a developing solution for the light-sensitive resin composition of the present invention if the composition contains alkali soluble resin or alkali soluble monomers or oligomers, and further a developer solution pre¬pared by adding a small amount of a water-miscible organic solvent thereto is included as well.<br>
Examples of suitable alkaline materials include alkali metal hydroxides (for example, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide), alkali metal carbonates (for example, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate), alkali metal bicarbonates (for example, sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate), alkali metal silicates (for example, sodium silicate and potassium silicate), alkali metal metasilicates (for example, sodium metasilicate and potassium metasili-cate), triethanolamine, diethanolamine, monoethanolamine, morpholine, tetraalkylammonium<br><br>
hydroxides (for example, tetramethyiammonium hydroxide), or trisodium phosphate. The concetration of the alkaline substance is 0.01 to 30 weight %, and pH is preferably 8 to 14.<br>
Suitable organic solvents which are miscible with water include methanol, ethanol, 2-propan-ol, 1-propanol, butanol, diacetone alcohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether, diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, propyl-eneglycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethyl-3-ethoxypropionate, methyl-3-methoxypropionate, n-butyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexa-none, 2-heptanone, 2-pentanone, epsilon-caprolactone, gamma-butylolactone, dimethylfor-mamide, dimethylacetoamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, ethyl lactate, methyl lactate, epsi-lon-caprolactam, and N-methyl-pyrrolidinone. The concentration of the organic solvent which is miscible with water is 0.1 to 30 weight %.<br>
Further, a publicly known surface active agent can be added. The concentration of the sur¬face active agent is preferably 0.001 to 10 weight %.<br>
The light sensitive resin composition of the present invention can also be developed with or¬ganic solvents, including blends of two or more solvents, not containing alkaline compounds. Suitable solvents include methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-propanol, butanol, diacetone al¬cohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether, diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, propyleneglycol monomethyl ether ace¬tate, ethyI-3-ethoxypropionate, methyl-3-methoxypropionate, n-butyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, 2-pentanone, epsilon-caprolactone, gamma-butylolactone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexa¬methylphosphoramide, ethyl lactate, methyl lactate, epsilon-caprolactam, and N-methyl-pyrrolidinone. Optionally, water can be added to these solvents up to a level at which still a clear solution is obtained and at which sufficient solubility of the unexposed areas of the light sensitive composition is maintained.<br>
The developer solution can be used in all forms known to the person skilled in the art, for ex¬ample in form of a bath solution, puddle, or a spraying solution.

other hand, glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate are advantageous from the viewpoint of sensitivity and heat resistance because they have a low molecular weight and can give a high conversion of esterification.<br>

Examples are disclosed in, JP 50-34443-B4 and JP 50-34444-B4, US 5153095, by T. Kudo et al. in J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 37 (1998), p. 3594-3603, US 5677385, and US 5650233.<br>
The weight-average molecular weight of the binders is preferably 500 to 1'000'000, e.g. 3*000 to VOOO'000, more preferably 5'000 to 400r000.<br>
These compounds may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more kinds. The content of the binder in the light-sensitive resin composition is preferably 10 to 95 weight %, more pref¬erably 15 to 90 weight % based on the whole solid matters.<br>
Further, in the color filter the total solid component of each color may contain an ionic impu¬rity-scavenger, e.g. an organic compound having an epoxy group. The concentration of the<br><br>
ionic impurity scavenger in the total solid component generally is in the range from 0.1% by<br>
weight to 10% by weight.<br>
Examples of color filters, especially with respect to the above described combinations of<br>
pigments and ionic impurity scavenger are given in EP 320264.   It is understood, that the<br>

The heat treatment can be performed after ex¬posure or after development of the latent pigment-containing photoimageable layer. Such la¬tent pigments are soluble pigment precursors which can be transformed into insoluble pig¬ments by means of chemical, thermal, photolytic or radiation induced methods as described, for example, in US 5879855. This transformation of such latent pigments can be enhanced by adding a compound which generates acid at actinic exposure or by adding an acidic com¬pound to the composition. Therefore, a color filter resist can also be prepared, which compri¬ses a latent pigment in a composition according to this invention.<br>

S15-S18; US 5368976; US 5800952; US 5882843; US 5879855; US 5866298; US 5863678; JP 06-230212-A; EP 320264; JP 09-269410-A; JP 10-221843-A; JP 01-090516-A; JP 10-171119-A, US 5821016, US 5847015, US 5882843, US 5719008, EP 881541, or EP 902327.<br>
The photoinitiators of the present invention can be used in color filter resists, for example, such as those given as examples above, or can partially or fully replace the known photoini¬tiators in such resists. It is understood by a person skilled in the art that the use of the new photoinitiators of the present invention is not limited to the specific binder resins, crosslinkers<br><br>
and formulations of the color filter resist examples given hereinbefore but can be used in conjunction with any radically polymerizable component in combination with a dye or color pigment or latent pigment to form a photosensitive color filter ink or color filter resist.<br>
Accordingly, subject of the invention also is a color filter prepared by providing red, green and blue (RGB) colour elements and, optionally a black matrix, all comprising a photosensi¬tive resin and a pigment on a transparent substrate and providing a transparent electrode ei¬ther on the surface of the substrate or on the surface of the color filter layer, wherein said photosensitive resin comprises a polyfunctional acrylate monomer, an organic polymer binder and a photopolymerization initiator of formula I, II or III as described above. The monomer and binder components, as well as suitable pigments are as described above. In the manufacture of color filters the transparent electrode layer can either be applied on the surface of the transparent substrate or can be provided on the surface of the red, green and blue picture elements and the black matrix. The transparent substrate is for example a glass substrate which can additionally have an electrode layer on its surface. It is preferred to apply a black matrix between the color areas of different color in order to im¬prove the contrast of a color filter.<br>
Instead of forming a black matrix using a photosensitive composition and patterning the black photosensitive composition photolithographically by patternwise exposure (i.e. through a suitable mask) to form the black pattern separating the red green and blue coloured areas on the tranparent substrate it is alternatively possible to use an inorganic black matrix. Such in¬organic black matrix can be formed from deposited (i.e. sputtered) metal (i.e. chromium) film on the transparent substrate by a suitable imaging process, for example utilizing photolitho¬graphic patterning by means of an etch resist, etching the inorganic layer in the areas not protected by the etch resist and then removing the remaining etch resist.<br>
There are different methods known how and at which step in the color filter manufacturing process the black matrix can be applied. It can either be applied directly on the transparent substrate prior to formation of the red, green and blue (RGB) colour filter as already men¬tioned above, or it can be applied after the RGB colour filter is formed on the substrate.<br><br>
In a different embodiment of a color filter for a liqid crystal display, according to US 5626796, the black matrix can also be applied on the substrate opposite to the RGB color filter ele¬ment-carrying substrate, which is separated from the former by a liquid crystal layer.<br>
If the transparent electrode layer is deposited after applying the RGB color filter elements and -optionally - the black matrix, ah additional overcoat film as aprotective layer can be ap¬plied on the color filter layer prior to deposition of the electrode layer, for example, as de¬scribed in US 5650263.<br>
To form an overcoat layer of a color filter, photosensitive resin or thermosetting resin compo¬sitions are employed. The photosensitive composition of the present invention can also be used to form such overcoat layers, because a cured film of the composition is excellent in flatness, hardness, chemical and thermal resistance, transparency especially in a visible re¬gion, adhesion to a substrate, and suitability for forming a transparent conductive film, e.g., an ITO film, thereon. In the production of a protective layer, there has been a demand that unnecessary parts of the protective layer, for example on scribing lines for cutting the sub¬strate and on bonding pads of solid image sensors should be removed from the substrate as described in JP57-42009-A, JP1-130103-A and JP1-134306-A. In this regard, it is difficult to selectively form a protective layer with good precision using the above-mentioned thermoset¬ting resins. The photosensitive composition, however, allows to easily remove the unneces¬sary parts of the protective layer by photolithography.<br>
It is obvious to those skilled in the art, that the photosensitive compositions of the present in¬vention can be used for generating red, green and blue color pixels and a black matrix, for the manufacture of a color filter, regardless of the above described differences in processing, regardless, of additional layers which can be applied and regardless of differences in the de¬sign of the color filter. The use of a composition according to the present invention to form colored elements shall not be regarded as limited by different designs and manufacturing processes of such color filters.<br>
The photo-sensitive composition of the present invention can suitably be used for forming a color filter but will not be limited to this application. It is useful as well for a recording material, a resist material, a protective layer, a dielectric layer, in display applications and display ele¬ments, a paint, and a printing ink.<br><br>
The photosensitive compositions according to the invention are also suitable for manufactur¬ing interlayer insulating layers or dielectric layers in a liquid crystal display, and more particu¬larly in a reflection type liquid crystal display including an active matrix type display having a thin film transistor(TFT) as a switching device, and a passive matrix type without a switching<br>
device.<br>
In recent years, liquid crystal displays have, for example, been widely used for pocket-type TV sets and terminal devices for communication by virtue of its small thickness and light weight. A reflection type liquid crystal display without necessity of using a back light is in par¬ticular in demand because it is ultra-thin and light-weight, and it can significantly reduce power consumption. However, even if a back light is removed out of a presently available transmission type color liquid crystal display and a light reflection plate is added to a lower surface of the display, it would cause a problem in that the efficiency of utilizing lights is low, and it is not possible to have practical brightness.<br>
As a solution to this problem, there have been suggested various reflection type liquid crystal displays for enhancing an efficiency of utilizing lights. For instance, a certain reflection type liquid crystal display is designed to include a pixel electrode having reflection function. The reflection type liquid crystal display includes an insulating substrate and an opposing substrate spaced away from the insulating substrate. A space between the substrates is filled with liquid crystals. A gate electrode is formed on the insulating substrate, and both the gate electrode and the insulating substrate are covered with a gate insulating film. A semi¬conductor layer is then formed on the gate insulating film above the gate electrode. A source electrode and a drain electrode are also formed on the gate insulating film in contact with the semiconductor layer. The source electrode, the drain electrode, the semiconductor layer, and the gate electrode cooperate with one another to thereby constitute a bottom gate type TFT as a switching device.<br>
An interlayer insulating film is formed covering the source electrode, the drain electrode, the semiconductor layer, and the gate insulating film therewith. A contact hole is formed throughout the interlayer insulating film on the drain electrode. A pixel electrode made of alu¬minum is formed on both the interlayer insulating film and an inner sidewall of the contact hole. The drain electrode of the TFT is eventually in contact with the pixel electrode through the interlayer insulating film. The interlayer insulating layer is generally designed to have a roughened surface by which the pixel electrode acts as a reflection plate which diffuses lights to get a wider angle for viewing(angle of visibility).<br><br>
The reflection type liquid crystal display remarkably enhances an efficiency of using lights by virtue that the pixel electrode acts as a light reflection plate.<br>
In the above-mentioned reflection type liquid crystal display, the interlayer insulating film is designed to have projections and recesses by photolithography. To form and control a fine shape of the projections and recesses in micrometer order for surface roughness and to form contact holes, photolithography methods using positive and negative photoresists are used. For these resists the compositions according to the invention are especially suitable.<br>
The photosensitive compositions according to the invention can further be used for manufac¬turing spacers, which control a cell gap of the liquid crystal part in liquid crystal display pan¬els. Since the properties of light transmitted or reflected through the liquid crystal layer in a liquid crystal display are dependent on the cell gap, the thickness accuracy and uniformity over the pixel array are critical parameters for the performance of the liquid crystal display unit. In a liquid crystal cell, the spacing between the substrates in the cell is maintained con¬stant by sparsely distributing glass or polymer spheres about several micrometers in diame¬ter as spacers between the substrates. The spacers are thus held between the substrates to maintain the distance between the substrates at a constant value. The distance is deter¬mined by the diameter of the spacers. The spacers assure the minimum spacing between the substrates; i.e., they prevent a decrease in distance between the substrates. However, they cannot prevent the substrates from being separated apart from each other, i.e., the in¬crease in distance between the substrates. Additionally, this method of using spacer beads has problems of the uniformity in the diameter of spacer beads and difficulty in the even dis¬persion of spacer beads on the panel, as well as nonuniform orientation and decrease in brightness and/or optical aperture depending on the location of spacers on pixel array region. Liquid crystal displays having a large image display area have recently been attracting much attention. However, the increase in the area of a liquid crystal cell generally produces the distortion of the substrates constituting the cell. The layer structure of the liquid crystal tends to be destroyed due to the deformation of the substrate. Thus, even when spacers are used for maintaining the spacing between the substrates constant, a liquid crystal display having a large image display area is unfeasible because the display experiences disturbances. In¬stead of the above spacer sphere dispersion method, a method of forming columns in the cell gap as spacers has been proposed. In this method, columns of a resin are formed as spacers in the region between the pixel array region and the counter electrode to form a pre¬scribed cell gap.  Photosensitive materials having adhesive properties with photolithography<br><br>
are commonly used, for instance, in the manufacturing process of color filters. This method is advantageous compared with the conventional method using spacer beads in the points that location, number and height of the spacers may be controlled freely. In a color liquid crystal display panel, such spacers are formed in the nonimaging area under black matrix of color filter elements. Therefore, the spacers formed using photosensitive compositions do not decrease brightness and optical aperture.<br>
Photosensitive compositions for producing protective layer with spacers for color filters are disclosed in JP 2000-81701-A and dry film type photoresists for spacer materials are also disclosed in JP 11-174459-A and JP 11-174464-A. As described in the documents, the pho¬tosensitive compositions, liquid and dry film photoresists, are comprising at least an alkaline or acid soluble binder polymer, a radically polymerizable monomer, and a radical initiator. In some cases, thermally crosslinkable components such as epoxide and carboxylic acid may additionally be included.<br>
The steps to form spacers using a photosensitive composition are as follows: a photosensitive composition is applied to the substrate, for instance a color filter panel and after the substrate is prebaked, it is exposed to light through a mask. Then, the substrate is developed with a developer and patterned to form the desired spacers. When the composi¬tion contains some thermosetting components, usually a postbaking is carried out to ther¬mally cure the composition.<br>
The photocurable compositions according to the invention are suitable for producing spacers for liquid crystal displays (as described above) because of their high sensitivity.<br>
The photosensitive compositions according to the invention are also suitable for manufactur¬ing microlens arrays used in liquid crystal display panels, image sensors and the like. Microlenses are microscopic passive optical components that fit on active optoelectronic de¬vices such as detectors, displays, and light emitting devices(light-emitting diodes, transversal and vertical cavity lasers) to improve their optical input or output quality. The areas of appli¬cations are wide and cover areas such as telecommunications, information technology, au¬dio-visual services, solar cells, detectors, solid-state light sources, and optical interconnects. Present optical systems use a variety of techniques to obtain efficient coupling between mi¬crolenses and microoptical devices.<br>
The microlens arrays are used for condensing illuminating light on the picture element re¬gions of a nonluminescent display device, such as a liquid crystal display devices, to in¬crease the brightness of the display, for condensing incident light or as a means for forming<br><br>
an image on the photoelectric conversion regions of a line image sensor used for example in facsimiles and the like to improve the sensitivity of these devices, and for forming an image to be printed on a photosensitive means used in liquid crystal printers or light emitting diode (LED) printers.<br>
The most common application is their use to improve the efficiency of photodetector arrays of a solid-state image sensing device such as a charge coupled device (CCD). In a detector ar¬ray, the collection of as much light as possible in each detector element or pixel is wanted. If a microlens is put on top of each pixel, the lens collects incoming light and focuses it onto an active area that is smaller than the size of the lens. According to the prior-art, microlens arrays can be produced by a variety of methods;<br>
(1)	A method for obtaining convex lenses wherein a pattern of the lenses in a planar configu¬ration is drawn on a thermoplastic resin by a conventional photolithographic technique or the like, and then the thermoplastic resin is heated to a temperature above the softening point of the resin to have flowability, thereby causing a sag in the pattern edge (so called "reflowing") (see, e.g., JP 60-38989-A, JP 60-165623-A, JP 61-67003-A, and JP 2000-39503-A). In this method, when the thermoplastic resin used is photosensitive, a pattern of the lenses can be obtained by exposure of this resin to light.<br>
(2)	A method for forming a plastic or glass material by the use of a mold or a stamper. As lens material, a photocurable resin and a thermosetting resin can be used in this method (see, e.g., WO99/38035).<br>
(3)	A method for forming convex lenses on the basis of a phenomenon in which when a pho¬tosensitive resin is exposed to light in a desired pattern by the use of an aligner, unreacted monomers move from the unexposed regions to the exposed regions, resulting in a swell of the exposed regions (see, e.g., Journal of the Research Group in Microoptics Japanese So¬ciety of Applied Physics, Colloquium in Optics, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 118-123 (1987) and Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 87-92(1988)).<br>
On the upper surface of a supporting substrate, a photosensitive resin layer is formed. Thereafter, with the use of a separate shading mask, the upper surface of the photosensitive resin layer is illuminated with light from a mercury lamp or the like, so that the photosensitive resin layer is exposed to the light. As a result, the exposed portions of the photosensitive resin layer swell into the shape of convex lenses to form the light condensing layer having a plurality of microlens.<br>
(4)	A method for obtaining convex lenses wherein a photosensitive resin is exposed to light<br>
by a proximity exposure technique in which a photomask is not brought into contact with the<br><br>
resin, to cause a blur at the pattern edge, so that the amount of photochemical reaction products is distributed depending upon the degree of blurring at the pattern edge (see, e.g., JP61-153602-A).<br>
(5) A method for generating a lens effect wherein a photosensitive resin is exposed to light with a particular intensity distribution to form a distribution pattern of refractive index depend¬ing upon the light intensity (see, e.g., JP 60-72927-A and JP 60-166946-A). The photosensitive compositions according to the invention can be used in any one of the above-mentioned methods to form microlens arrays using photocurable resin compositions.<br>
A particular class of techniques concentrates on forming microlenses in thermoplastic resins like photoresist. An example is published by Popovic et al. in the reference SPIE 898, pp.23-25 (1988). The technique, named reflow technique, comprises the steps of defining the lenses' footprint in a thermoplastic resin, e.g. by photolithography in a photosensitive resin like a photoresist, and subsequently heating this material above its reflow temperature. The surface tension draws the island of photoresist into a spherical cap with a volume equal to the original island before the reflow. This cap is a plano-convex microlens. Advantages of the technique are, amongst others, the simplicity, the reproducibility, and the possibility of in¬tegration directly on top of a light-emitting or light-detecting optoelectronic device. In some cases, an overcoat layer is formed on the patterned lens units with a rectangular shape prior to reflowing to avoid a sagging of the island of the resin in the middle without re¬flow into a spherical cap in the reflow step. The overcoat acts as a permanent protective layer. The coating layer is also made of a photosensitive composition. Microlens arrays can also be fabricated by the use of a mold or a stamper as, for example, disclosed in EP0932256A2. A process of manufacturing the planar microlens array is as fol¬lows: a release agent is coated on a shaping surface of a stamper on which convex portions are densely arranged, and a photocurable synthetic resin material having a high refractive index is set on the shaping surface of the stamper. Next, the base glass plate is pushed onto the synthetic resin material, thereby spreading the synthetic resin material, and the synthetic resin material is cured by irradiating with ultraviolet radiation or by heating and is shaped to form the convex microlenses. Thereafter the stamper is peeled off. Then, a photocurable synthetic resin material having a low refractive index is additionally coated onto the convex microlenses as an adhesive layer and a glass substrate which is made into a cover glass plate is pushed onto the synthetic resin material, thereby spreading the same. The synthetic resin material is then cured and finally the planar microlens array is formed.<br><br>
As disclosed in US 5969867, a similar method using a mold is applied for the production of a prism sheet, which is used as a part of backlight units for color liquid crystal display panels to enhance the brightness. A prism sheet forming a prism row on one side is mounted on the light-emitting surface of the backlight. For fabricating a prism sheet, an active energy ray-curable composition is cast and spread in a lens mold which is made of metal, glass or resin and forms the lens shape of the prism row, etc., after which a transparent substrate sheet is placed onto it and active energy rays from an active energy ray-emitting source are irradiated through the sheet for curing. The prepared lens sheet is then released from the lens mold to obtain the lens sheet.<br>
The active energy ray-curable composition used to form the lens section must have a variety of properties, including adhesion to the transparent substrate, and suitable optical character¬istics.<br>
Lenses at least with some photoresists in the prior art are not desirable for some applications since the optical transmittance in the blue end of the optical spectrum is poor. Because the photocurable compositions according to the invention have low yellowing prop¬erties, both thermally and photochemically, they are suitable for the production of microlens arrays as described above.<br>
The novel radiation-sensitive compositions are also suitable for photo-lithographic steps used in the production process of plasma display panels (PDP), particularly for the imaging form¬ing process of barrier rib, phosphor layer and electrodes.<br>
The PDP is a planar display for displaying images and information by virtue of the emission of light by gas discharge. By the construction of panel and the method of operation, it is known in two types, i.e. DC (direct current) type and AC (alternating current) type. By way of example, the principle of the DC type color PDP will be briefly explained. In the DC type color PDP, the space intervening between two transparent substrates (generally glass plates) is divided into numerous minute cells by latticed barrier ribs interposed between the transparent substrates. In the individual cells a discharge gas, such as He or Xe, is sealed. On the rear wall of each cell there is a phosphor layer which, on being excited by the ultravio¬let light generated by the discharge of the discharge gas, emits visible light of three primary colors. On the inner faces of the two substrates, electrodes are disposed as opposed to each other across the relevant cells. Generally, the cathodes are formed of a film of trans¬parent electroconductive material such as NESA glass. When a high voltage is applied be¬tween these electrodes formed on the fore wall and the rear wall, the discharge gas which is<br><br>
sealed in the cells induces plasma discharge and, by virtue of the ultraviolet light radiated consequently, incites the fluorescent elements of red, blue, and green colors to emit lights and effect the display of an image. In the full-color display system, three fluorescent ele¬ments severally of the three primary colors of red, blue, and green mentioned above jointly form one picture element.<br>
The cells in the DC type PDP are divided by the component barrier ribs of a lattice, whereas those in the AC type PDP are divided by the barrier ribs which are arranged parallel to each other on the faces of the substrates. In either case, the cells are divided by barrier ribs. These barrier ribs are intended to confine the luminous discharge within a fixed area to pre¬clude false discharge or cross talk between adjacent discharge cells and ensure ideal dis¬play.<br>
The compositions according to the invention also find application for the production of one- or more-layered materials for the image recording or image reproduction (copies, reprography), which may be mono- or polychromatic. Furthermore the materials are suitable for color proofing systems. In this technology formulations containing microcapsules can be applied and for the image production the radiation curing can be followed by a thermal treatment. Such systems and technologies and their applications are for example disclosed in US 5376459.<br>
Photocuring is of great importance for printings, since the drying time of the ink is a critical factor for the production rate of graphic products, and should be in the order of fractions of seconds. UV-curable inks are particularly important for screen printing and offset inks.<br>
As already mentioned above, the novel mixtures are highly suitable also for producing prin¬ting plates. This application uses, for example, mixtures of soluble linear polyamides or sty-rene/butadiene and/or styrene/isoprene rubber, polyacrylates or polymethyl methacrylates containing carboxyl groups, polyvinyl alcohols or urethane acrylates with photopolymerizable monomers, for example acrylamides and/or methacrylamides, or acrylates and/or methacry¬lates, and a photoinitiator. Films and plates of these systems (wet or dry) are exposed over the negative (or positive) of the printed original, and the uncured parts are subsequently washed out using an appropriate solvent or aqueous solutions.<br><br>
Another field where photocuring is employed is the coating of metals, in the case, for exam¬ple, of the coating of metal plates and tubes, cans or bottle caps, and the photocuring of po¬lymer coatings, for example of floor or wall coverings based on PVC. Examples of the photocuring of paper coatings are the colourless varnishing of labels, record sleeves and book covers.<br>
Also of interest is the use of the novel photoinitiators for curing shaped articles made from composite compositions. The composite compound consists of a self-supporting matrix ma¬terial, for example a glass fibre fabric, or alternatively, for example, plant fibres [cf. K.-P. Mieck, T. Reussmann in Kunststoffe 85 (1995), 366-370], which is impregnated with the pho¬tocuring formulation. Shaped parts comprising composite compounds, when produced using the novel compounds, attain a high level of mechanical stability and resistance. The novel compounds can also be employed as photocuring agents in moulding, impregnating and coating compositions as are described, for example, in EP 7086. Examples of such com¬positions are gel coat resins, which are subject to stringent requirements regarding curing ac¬tivity and yellowing resistance, and fibre-reinforced mouldings, for example, light diffusing panels which are planar or have lengthwise or crosswise corrugation. Techniques for produc¬ing such mouldings, such as hand lay-up, spray lay-up, centrifugal casting or filament wind¬ing, are described, for example, by P.H. Selden in "Glasfaserverstarkte Kunststoffe", page 610, Springer Verlag Berlin-Heidelberg-New York 1967. Examples of articles which can be produced by these techniques are boats, fibre board or chipboard panels with a double-sided coating of glass fibre-reinforced plastic, pipes, containers, etc. Further examples of moulding, impregnating and coating compositions are UP resin gel coats for mouldings containing glass fibres (GRP), such as corrugated sheets and paper laminates. Paper laminates may be based on urea resins or melamine resins. Prior to production of the laminate, the gel coat is produced on a support (for example a film). The novel photocurable compositions can also be used for casting resins or for embedding articles, for example electronic components, etc..<br>
The compositions and compounds according to the invention can be used for the production of holographies, waveguides, optical switches wherein advantage is taken of the develop¬ment of a difference in the index of refraction between irradiated and unirradiated areas.<br>
The use of photocurable compositions for imaging techniques and for the optical production of information carriers is also important. In such applications, as already described above,<br><br>
the layer (wet or dry) applied to the support is irradiated imagewise, e.g. through a photo¬mask, with UV or visible light, and the unexposed areas of the layer are removed by treat¬ment with a developer. Application of the photocurable layer to metal can also be carried out by electrodeposition. The exposed areas are polymeric through crosslinking and are there¬fore insoluble and remain on the support. Appropriate colouration produces visible images. Where the support is a metallized layer, the metal can, following exposure and development, be etched away at the unexposed areas or reinforced by electroplating. In this way it is pos¬sible to produce electronic circuits and photoresists. When used in image-forming materials the novel photoinitiators provide excellent performance in generating so called printout imag¬es, whereby a color change is induced due to irradiation. To form such printout images dif¬ferent dyes and/or their leuco form are used and examples for such print out image systems can be fount e.g. in WO 96/41240. EP 706091. EP 511403, US 3579339. and US 4622286.<br>
The novel photoinitiator is also suitable for a photopatternable composition for forming a di¬electric layer of a multilayer layer circuit board produced by a sequential build-up process.<br>
The invention, as described above, provides compositions for producing pigmented and non-pigmented paints and varnishes, powder coatings, printing inks, printing plates, adhesives, dental compositions, putty materials, gel coats, photoresists for electronics like electroplating resist, etch resist, both liquid and dry films, solder resist, as resists to manufacture color fil¬ters for a variety of display applications or to generate structures in the manufacturing proc¬esses of plasma-display panels (e.g. barrier rib, phosphor layer, electrode), electrolumines¬cence displays and LCD (e.g. Interlayer insulating layer, spacers, microlens array), as com¬position for encapsulating electrical and electronic components, for producing magnetic re¬cording materials, micromechanical parts, waveguides, optical switches, plating masks, etch masks, colour proofing systems, glass fibre cable coatings, screen printing stencils, for pro¬ducing three-dimensional objects by means of stereolithography, and as image recording material, especially for holographic recordings, microelectronic circuits, decolorizing materi¬als, decolorizing materials for image recording materials, for image recording materials using microcapsules.<br>
Substrates used for photographic information recordings include, for example, films of poly¬ester, cellulose acetate or polymer-coated papers; substrates for offset printing formes are specially treated aluminium, substrates for producing printed circuits are copper-clad lami-<br><br>
nates, and substrates for producing integrated circuits are, for example, silicon wafers. The layer thickness of the photosensitive layer for photographic materials and offset printing forms is generally from about 0.5 pm to 10 pm, while for printed circuits it is from 0.1 pm to about 100 pm. Following the coating of the substrates, the solvent is removed, generally by drying, to leave a coat of the photoresist on the substrate.<br>
Coating of the substrates can be carried out by applying to the substrate a liquid compo¬sition, a solution or a suspension. The choice of solvents and the concentration depend prin¬cipally on the type of composition and on the coating technique. The solvent should be inert, i.e. it should not undergo a chemical reaction with the components and should be able to be removed again, after coating, in the course of drying. Examples of suitable solvents are ke¬tones, ethers and esters, such as methyl ethyl ketone, isobutyl methyl ketone, cyclopen-tanone, cyclohexanone, N-methylpyrrolidone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate, 2-methoxypropyIacetate, methyl-3-methoxypropionate, 2-heptanone, 2-pentanone, and ethyl lactate.<br>
The solution is applied uniformly to a substrate by means of known coating techniques, for example by spin coating, dip coating, knife coating, curtain coating, brushing, spraying, es¬pecially by electrostatic spraying, and reverse-roll coating, and also by means of electropho-retic deposition. It is also possible to apply the photosensitive layer to a temporary, flexible support and then to coat the final substrate, for example a copper-clad circuit board, or a glass substrate by transferring the layer via lamination.<br>
The quantity applied (coat thickness) and the nature of the substrate (layer support) are de¬pendent on the desired field of application. The range of coat thicknesses generally com¬prises values from about 0.1 pm to more than 100 pm, for example 0.1 pm to 1 cm, pre¬ferably 0.5 pm to 1000 pm.<br>
Following the coating of the substrates, the solvent is removed, generally by drying, to leave an essentially dry resist film of the photoresist on the substrate.<br>
The photosensitivity of the novel compositions can extend in general from about 150 nm to 600 nm, for example 190-600 nm, (UV-vis region). Suitable radiation is present, for example, in sunlight or light from artificial light sources. Consequently, a large number of very different types of light sources are employed. Both point sources and arrays (lamp carpets") are suit-<br><br>
able. Examples are carbon arc lamps, xenon arc lamps, low-, medium-, high- and super high- pressure mercury lamps, possibly with metal halide dopes (metal-halogen lamps), mi¬crowave-stimulated metal vapour lamps, excimer lamps, superactinic fluorescent tubes, fluo¬rescent lamps, argon incandescent lamps, electronic flashlights, photographic flood lamps, light emitting diodes (LED), electron beams and X-rays. The distance between the lamp and the substrate to be exposed in accordance with the invention may vary depending on the in¬tended application and the type and output of lamp, and may be, for example, from 2 cm to 150 cm. Laser light sources, for example excimer lasers, such as F2 excimer lasers at 157 nm exposure, KrF excimer lasers for exposure at 248 nm and ArF excimer lasers for ex¬posure at 193 nm are also suitable. Lasers in the visible region can also be employed.<br>
The term "imagewise" exposure includes both, exposure through a photomask comprising a predetermined pattern, for example a slide, a chromium mask, a stencil mask or a reticle, as well as exposure by means of a laser or light beam, which for example is moved under com¬puter control over the surface of the coated substrate and in this way produces an image. Suitable UV laser exposure systems for the purpose are, for example, provided by Etec and Orbotech(DP-100™ DIRECT IMAGING SYSTEM), as well as DI-FPD, DI-2080 from PEN-TAX. And the computer-controlled irradiation can also be achieved by electron beams. It is also possible to use masks made of liquid crystals that can be addressed pixel by pixel to generate digital images, as is, for example, described by A. Bertsch, J.Y. Jezequel, J.C. An¬dre in Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry 1997, 107, p. 275-281 and by K.-P. Nicolay in Offset Printing 1997, 6, p. 34-37.<br>
Following the imagewise exposure of the material and prior to development, it may be advan¬tageous to carry out thermal treatment for a short time. After the development a thermal post bake can be performed to harden the composition and to remove all traces of solvents. The temperatures employed are generally 50-250°C, preferably 80-220°C; the duration of the thermal treatment is in general between 0.25 and 60 minutes.<br>
The photocurable composition may additionally be used in a process for producing printing plates or photoresists as is described, for example, in DE 4013358. In such a process the composition is exposed for a short time to visible light with a wavelength of at least 400 nm, without a mask, prior to, simultaneously with or following imagewise irradiation.<br><br>
After the exposure and, if implemented, thermal treatment, the unexposed areas of the pho¬tosensitive coating are removed with a developer in a manner known per se.<br>
As already mentioned, the novel compositions can be developed by aqueous alkalis or or¬ganic solvents. Particularly suitable aqueous-alkaline developer solutions are aqueous solu¬tions of tetraalkylammonium hydroxides or of alkali metal silicates, phosphates, hydroxides and carbonates. Minor quantities of wetting agents and/or organic solvents may also be ad¬ded, if desired, to these solutions. Examples of typical organic solvents, which may be added to the developer liquids in small quantities, are cyclohexanone, 2-ethoxyethanol, toluene, acetone and mixtures of such solvents. Depending on the substrate also solvents, e.g. or¬ganic solvents, can be used as developer, or, as mentioned above mixtures of aqueous alka¬lis with such solvents. Particularly useful solvents for solvent development include methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-propanol, butanol, diacetone alcohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether, diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, propyleneglycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethyl-3-ethoxypropionate, methyl-3-methoxypropionate, n-butyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, 2-pentanone, epsilon-caprolactone, gamma-butylolactone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethyiphosphoramide, ethyl lact¬ate, methyl lactate, epsilon-caprolactam, and N-methyl-pyrrolidinone. Optionally, water can be added to these solvents up to a level at which still a clear solution is obtained and at which sufficient solubility of the unexposed areas of the light sensitive composition is main¬tained.<br>
The invention therefore also provides a process for the photopolymerization of compounds containing ethylenically unsaturated double bonds, i.e. monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric compounds containing at least one ethylenically unsaturated double bond, which comprises adding to these compounds at least one photoinitiator of the formula I, II, III or IV as de¬scribed above and irradiating the resulting composition with electromagnetic radiation, in par¬ticular light of the wavelength 150 to 600 nm, in particular 190-600 nm, with electron beam, or with X-rays.<br>
The invention further provides a coated substrate which is coated on at least one surface with a composition as described above, and describes a process for the photographic pro¬duction of relief images, in which a coated substrate is subjected to imagewise exposure and<br><br>
then the unexposed portions are removed with a developer. Imagewise exposure may be ef¬fected by irradiating through a mask or by means of a laser or electron beam as already de¬scribed above. Of particular advantage in this context is the laser beam exposure already mentioned above.<br>
The compounds of the invention have a good thermal stability and low volatility, and are also suitable for photopolymerisations in the presence of air (oxygen). Further, they cause only low yellowing in the compositions after photopolymerization.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention in more detail. Parts and percentages are, as in the remainder of the description and in the claims, by weight, unless stated otherwise. Where alkyl radicals having more than three carbon atoms are referred to without any men¬tion of specific isomers, the n-isomers are meant in each case.<br><br>
To N-ethylcarbazole (5.0 g; 25.6 mmol) in CH2CI2 (40 mi) are added 2-thenoyl chloride (thio-phen-2-carbonylchloride) (3.75 g; 25.6 mmol) and AICI3 (3.40 g; 25.6 mmol). After stirring for 4h at room temperature, acetyl chloride (2.0 g; 25.6 mmol) and AICI3 (3.4 g; 25.6 mmol) are added. This reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. Then, the reaction mixture is poured into icewater. The products are extracted with CH2CI2.

30,1: Preparation of Poly(benzylmethacrylate-co-methacrylic acid)<br>
24 g of benzylmethacrylate, 6 g of methacrylic acid and 0.525 g of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) are dissolved in 90 ml of propylene glycol 1-monomethyl ether 2-acetate (PGMEA). The resulting reaction mixture is placed in a preheated oil bath at 80°C. After stirring for 5 hours at 80°C under nitrogen, the resulting viscous solution is cooled to room temperature and used without further purification. The solid content is about 25%. 30.2: Sensitivity tests<br>
A photocurable composition for a sensitivity test is prepared by mixing the following compo¬nents:<br>
200.0 parts by weight of copolymer of benzylmethacrylate and methacrylic acid<br>
(benzylmethacrylate : methacrylic acid = 80 : 20 by weight) 25% propylene glycol 1-monomethyl ether 2-acetate (PGMEA) solution, prepared as described above 50.0 parts by weight of dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate ((DPHA), provided by UCB<br>
Chemicals), 2.0 parts by weight of photoinitiator, and 150.0 parts by weight of PGMEA.<br>
All operations are carried out under yellow light. The compositions are applied to an alumi¬num plate using an electric applicator with a wire wound bar. The solvent is removed by heating at 100°C for 2 minutes in a convection oven. The thickness of the dry film is appro¬ximately 2 |im. A standardized test negative film with 21 steps of different optical density (Stouffer step wedge) is placed with an air gap of around 100 pm between the film and the resist. Exposure is carried out using a 250W super high pressure mercury lamp (USHIO, USH-250BY) at a distance of 15 cm. A total exposure dose measured by an optical power meter (ORC UV Light Measure Model UV-M02 with UV-35 detector) on the test negative film is 1000mJ/cm2. After exposure, the exposed film is developed with 1% sodium carbonate aqueous solution for 100 sec. at 30°C by using a spray type developer (Walter Lemmen, model T21). The sensitivity of the initiator system used is characterized by indicating the highest number of the step remained (i.e. polymerized) after developing. The higher the num¬ber of steps, the more sensitive is the system tested.   The results are listed in table 12.<br><br><br>

To that mixture 0.5 % (based on the solid content) of isopropylthioxanthone (RTMQUAN-TACURE ITX, provided by International Biosynthetics) and 2% (based on the solid content) of the initiator to be tested are added and stirred. All operations are carried out under yellow light. The formulations are applied to an aluminum plate. The solvent is removed by heating at 80 C° for 15 minutes in a convection oven. The thickness of the dry film is 25 ^im. To this coating an acetate film is applied, over which a standardized test negative with 21 steps of different optical density (Stouffer step wedge) is placed. The sample is covered with a sec¬ond UV-transparent film and pressed onto a metal plate by means of vacuum. Exposure is carried out in a first test series for 40 seconds, in a second series for 80 seconds and in a third series fori 60 seconds, using a metal halide lamp (ORC, model SMX 3000) at a dis¬tance of 60 cm. Following exposure, the cover films and the mask are removed and the ex¬posed film is developed with 1% sodium carbonate aqueous solution for 180 sec. at 30°C by using a spray type developer (Walter Lemmen, model T21).
