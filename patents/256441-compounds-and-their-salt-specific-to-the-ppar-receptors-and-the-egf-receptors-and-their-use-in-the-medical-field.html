FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and their salts specific to the PPAR<br>
receptors and the EGF receptors and their use in the medical field.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In particular, the compounds and their salts according to the present invention can be<br>
used advantageously for the prevention and treatment of tumours expressing the<br>
PPARy receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors) and the EGF<br>
receptors (Epidermal Growth Factor receptors) such as tumours of the: oesophagus,<br>
stomach, pancreas, colon, prostate, breast, uterus and appendages, kidneys and<br>
lungs. Moreover, the compounds and their salts according to the invention can be used<br>
for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, in particular chronic intestinal<br>
diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative rectocolitis.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
The PPARy receptors are nuclear receptors (group of approx. 50 transcription factors)<br>
which control the expression of many genes that are important for the regulation of<br>
lipid metabolism, the synthesis of insulin and the processes of carcinogenesis and<br>
inflammation. (Bull AW, Arch Pathol Lab Med 2003;127: 1121-1123) (Koeffler HP, Clin<br>
Cancer Res 2303; 9: 1-9) (Youssef J et a/., J Biomed Biotec 2004; 3: 156-166).<br>
There are various natural and synthetic agonists which bind to the PPARy receptors<br>
and alter their conformation, giving rise to activation. Natural and synthetic ligands are<br>
described in The Lancet 2002; 360:1410-1418.<br>
Recent studies have shown that treatment of tumour cells with ligands of the PPARy<br>
receptors induces a decrease in cellular proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis,<br>
suggesting potential application of such compounds as agents for preventing<br>
carcinogenesis (Osawa E etal, Gastroenterology 2003; 124:361-367).<br>
Other studies have shown that ligands of the PPARy receptors (e.g. troglitazone) have<br><br>
anti-inflammatory effects and inhibit the mucosal inflammatory response in animal<br>
models of IBD (Tanaka T ef al., Cancer Res 2001; 61: 2424-2428).<br>
Moreover, evidence has been published very recently that the intestinal anti-<br>
inflammatory activity of 5-ASA, the gold standard in the treatment of IBD, is dependent<br>
on binding, and consequent activation, of the PPARy receptors (Rousseaux C er al., J<br>
Exp Med 2005; 201: 1205-1215).<br>
The transmembrane receptor with tyrosine-kinase EGF activity is expressed to a very<br>
high degree in activated form in various types of neoplasms (Mendelsohn J, Endocr<br>
Relat Cancer 2001; 8: 3-9) (Harari PM, Endocr Relat Cancer 2004; 11: 689-708).<br>
Overexpression of the receptor is also related to potential ability of carcinomatous cells<br>
to metastasize. In connection to this, it has been demonstrated that EGF promotes the<br>
migration and invasiveness of various cell types connected with lesions at the level of<br>
interactions with the extracellular matrix (Brunton et al., Oncogene 1997; 14: 283-293).<br>
Numerous studies performed both on experimental animals and in humans have<br>
established the efficacy of inhibitors of the EGF receptor in controlling proliferation and<br>
the spread of tumours (Mendelsohn J, Endocr Relat Cancer 2001; 8: 3-9) (Harari PM,<br>
Endocr Relat Cancer 2004; 11: 689-708).<br>
There is no doubt that the intracellular signals triggered by activation of the EGF<br>
receptor facilitate the growth and survival of neoplastic cells, contributing to the<br>
development of the pathology, and that such signals are essential in determining the<br>
ability of tumour ceils to spread and colonize remote organs.- (Mendelsohn J, Endocr<br>
Relat Cancer 2001; 8: 3-9) (Kari C et al., Cancer Res 2003; 63: 1-5).<br>
From the foregoing and bearing in mind, moreover, that from the biological standpoint,<br>
chronic inflammatory processes play a part in carcinogenesis, it becomes clear that<br>
there is a real need for innovative research into new chemical entities which, by their<br>
complementary action both on the PPARy receptors and on the EGF receptors, are<br>
able to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour action, of the chemo-preventive, anti-<br>
proliferative and anti-metastatic type.<br>
The present invention provides a novel class of compounds that are suitable for the<br><br>
prevention and treatment of cancer and of chronic inflammation by the modulation of<br>
specific receptors such as the PPARy receptors and the EGF receptors.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Method of preparing (+)-2-hydroxy-3-(3'-aminophenyl)-propanoic acid<br>
(Compound 20)<br><br>
Step 1<br>
3-Nitrobenzaldehyde (45.3g, 0.3mol), N-acetylglycine (42.1g, 0.36mol) and sodium<br>
acetate (32g, 0.39mol) were mixed with acetic anhydride (142ml, 1.5mol) and the<br>
resulting mixture heated with stirring to 120°C for 6 hrs, giving a dark solution. The<br>
mixture was then cooled to RT overnight, resulting in the formation of a precipitated<br>
solid. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-water (130g) and the resulting<br>
suspended solid was collected by filtration. The crude solid product (72g) was washed<br>
with acetone (80ml) then recrystallized from hot acetone (320mi) io give a crystalline<br>
solid that was washed with 50% aqueous ethanol, then dried at 40°C/40mmHg to give<br>
2-methyl-4-(3-nitrobenzy!idene)oxazo!-5(4H)-one (49.0g, 78%) as pale yellow needles.<br>
1H NMR (δ, 250MHz, CDCI3) = 2.47 (3H, s), 7.15 (1H, s), 7.63 (1H, dd, 8.2 &amp; 7.6Hz),<br>
8.27 (1H, d, 8.2Hz), 8.34 (1H, d, 7.6Hz), 9.02 (1H, s).<br>
Step 2<br>
2-Methyl-4-(3-nitrobenzylidene)oxazol-5(4H)-one (52.0g, 0.224mol) was mixed with 3M<br>
hydrochloric acid (1.3L) and the suspension stirred at 100°C for 6h. The resulting<br>
suspension was stirred at RT overnight then the suspended solid was collected by<br>
filtration, washed with water (2 x 40ml), then dried in vacuo to give 2-hydroxy-3-(3-<br>
nitrophenyl)acrylic acid (29.3g). The combined filtrate and washes were extracted with<br>

2-hydroxy-3~(3-nitrophenyl)acrylic acid (5.25g, 25.0mmol) in methanol (131ml) to form<br>
a clear, pale yellow solution. Sodium borohydride (1g, 26.4mmol) was then carefully<br>
added in two portions and the mixture stirred at 5-10°C for 30mins. A small amount of<br>
water was then added to quench the reaction and destroy any excess NaBH4. The<br>
methanol was removed in vacuo to give a solid residue, which was ground with a 5:2<br>

acetate (37.9g, 0.463mol) were mixed with acetic anhydride (168g, 1.78mol) and the<br>
resulting mixture heated with stirring to 120°C for 6 hrs, giving a dark suspension. The<br>
mixture was then cooled to RT overnight, resulting in the formation of a precipitated<br>

to give 2-ethoxy-3-(3-nitrophenyl)acrylic acid as a yellow solid (3.06g, 61%).<br>
1H NMR (δ, 250MHz, DMSO-d6) = 1.34 (3H, t, 7Hz), 4.10 (2H, q, 7Hz), 7.04 (1H, s),<br>
7.69 (1H, t, 7.93Hz), 8.07-8.22 (2H, m), 8.80 (1H, m), 13.25 (1H, brs).<br>
Step 5<br>
A mixture of 2-ethoxy-3-(3-nitrophenyl)acrylic acid (3.06g, 12.9mmol), methanol<br>
(150ml) and 5% palladium on activated charcoal (0.60g, 2 mol%) was hydrogenated at<br>
12-30psi H2 atmosphere for 2hr. The mixture was then filtered through celite, the filter<br>
cake washed with methanol and the filtrates concentrated at 40°C under vacuum to<br>
give the product as a foamy solid. This was dissolved in water (100ml) and the solution<br>
freeze-dried to give (±)-2-ethoxy-3-(3'-aminophenyl)- propanoic acid (2.7g, 100%) as<br>
an off-white solid.<br>
1H NMR (δ, 250MHz, DMSO-d6) = 1.07 (3H, t, 7Hz), 2.6-2.85 (2H, m), 3.20-3.38 (1H,<br>
m), 3.40-3.60 (1H, m), 3.92 (1H, dd, 5 &amp; 7.7Hz), 6.3-6.45 (3H, m), 7.01 (1H, t, 7.6Hz).<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Molecular modelling<br>
Molecular modelling studies were performed using SYBYL software version 6.9.1<br>
(Tripos Associates Inc, St Louis, MO) running on Silicon Graphics workstations. Three-<br>
dimensional model of the zwitterion form of 5-ASA was built from a standard fragments<br>
library, and its geometry was subsequently optimized using the Tripos force field (3) As<br><br>
the pKa of compounds are still unknown, the SPARC online calculator was used to<br>
determine the species occurring at physiological pH<br>
(7.4)(http://ibmlc2.chem.uga.edu/sparc/index.cfm). Three-dimensional model of ionized<br>
compounds were built from a standard fragments library, and their geometry was<br>
subsequently optimized using the Tripos force field (3) including the electrostatic term<br>
calculated from Gasteiger and Huckel atomic charges. The method of Powell available<br>
in Maximin2 procedure was used for energy minimization until the gradient value was<br>
smaller than 0.001 kcal/mol.A.<br>
The structure of the human PPARy ligand-binding domain was obtained from its<br>
complexed X-Ray crystal structure with the tesaglitazar (AZ 242) available in the RCSB<br>
Protein Data Bank (117I) (4,5). Flexible docking of the compounds into the receptor<br>
active site was performed using GOLD software (6). The most stable docking models<br>
were selected according to the best scored conformation predicted by the GoldScore<br>
(6) and X-Score scoring functions (7). The complexes were energy-minimized using the<br>
Powell method available in Maximin2 procedure with the Tripos force field and a<br>
dielectric constant of 4.0 until the gradient value reached 0.01 kcal/mol.A. The anneal<br>
function was used defining around the ligand a hot region (10 A) and an interesting<br>
region (15 A).<br>
RESULTS<br>
The molecular modelling receptor docking studies predicted that, in general, the S<br>
enantiomer is more active that the R enantiomer, even though R enantiomer does<br>
show activity also. This phenomenon of one enantiomer being more biologically active<br>
is well known.<br>
As a consequence, the present invention provides a method to resolve the compounds<br>
into enantiomers. The resolution method for compound 32 is shown schematically in<br>
Figure 11.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the S-enantiomers of the<br>
compounds will afford higher activity. The results of the docking studies are shown in<br>
Figures 5-10.<br><br>

As per compound 34 steps 1 &amp; 2.<br>
Step 3<br>
2-Hydroxy-3-(4-nitrophenyl)acrylic acid (20g, 95.6mmol) was suspended in DMF<br>
(200ml). Cs2CO3 (74.9g, 229.9mmol) and diethyl sulphate (26.3ml, 201mmol) were<br>
added and dissolution was observed. After stirring for 18hr at 18°C water (350ml) and<br>
ethyl acetate (250ml) were added and the layers separated, The aqueous layer was<br>
further extracted with ethyl acetate (5 x 2Q0ml) then the combined organics were<br>
washed with water (2 x 200ml), brine (2 x 200ml) and dried over magnesium sulfate.<br>
The organics were concentrated to dryness to obtain ethyl 2-ethoxy-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-<br>
acrylate as an orange solid containing 3.6% by mass DME (27.6g wet, &gt;100% yield).<br>
1H NMR (δ, 250MHz, DMSO-d6): 1.32 (t, 6-H, 2 x CH2CH3), 4.13 (q, 2-H, CH2CH3),<br>
4.30 (q, 2-H, CH2CH3), 6.99 (s, 1-H, CH=), 8.06 (d, 2-H, CHaromatic), 8.26 (d, 2-H,<br>
CHaromatic).<br>
Step 4<br>
Ethyl 2-ethoxy-3-(4-nitrophenyl)acrylate containing 3.6wt% DMF (26.07g corrected,<br>
98.3mmol) was dissolved in IMS (500ml) and a solution of NaOH (1.44g, 36.1mmol) in<br>
water (260ml) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for<br>
18hr then acidified with 1M HCI (120ml) and the resulting solid collected by filtration,<br>
washed with water (2 x 100ml) and suction dried on the filter for 30mins, followed by<br><br>
RESULTS<br>
Activation of PPARy results in a cascade of reactions leading to a binding to specific<br>
DNA sequence elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE)<br>
(7-9).<br>
We investigated PPARy transcriptional activity by transient transfections of epithelial<br>
cells with the renilla luciferase and PPRE plamids. To evaluate if the new molecules<br>
have more efficacy than 5-ASA to stimulate PPARy activation, we tested these<br>
molecules at a concentration of 1mM. Effect of the new molecules at a concentration<br>
of 1 mM was compared to 5-ASA and rosiglitazone, used as positive controls at optima!<br>
concentrations of 30mM and 10-5 M respectively. Cells were stimulated with the<br>
different molecules during 24 hours.<br>
Analysis of PPARy activity in transfected HT-29 cells showed that the new molecules<br>
34, 39, 35 and 40 at 1mM increased the reporter gene activity by 4.8±0.71; 2.73+0.31;<br>
2.64±0.46; 3.4±0.97 fold respectively, thereby displaying an activity similar or superior<br>
to 5-ASA at 30mM (2.8+0.7 ) and rosiglitazone at 10¬5M (3.17+0.29).<br>
Figure 2 represents all the results obtained for each molecule assessed in 2 or 3<br>
experiments done in triplicate. Reproducibility between the different experiments is<br>
good and similar to data described in the literature.<br>
This study allowed us to identify 4 new molecules having 30 to 50 times more efficacy<br>
than 5-ASA to activate PPARy.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Colon cancer cell growth<br>
The following substances (i.e. 20, 34, 35, 39 and 40) were tested for their ability to<br>
modulate colon cancer cell growth. For this purpose, three human colon carcinoma cell<br>
lines (i.e. HT-29, HT-115 and DLD-1) were used. These cell types were selected on the<br>
basis of the cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Indeed, HT-115 cells express a<br>
biologically active COX-2, HT-29 cells express a non-functional COX-2 isoform, and<br>
DLD-1 are COX-2-deficient cells. It is believed that these molecules are also active<br>
on cells that do not express COX-, and thus the molecules of the present<br><br>
invention may be used in cells which do not express COX-2 for the purposes of<br>
treating tumours and other applications as herein described.<br>
HT-29 and DLD-1 cells were cultured in McCoy and RPMI1640 media respectively,<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and<br>
50mg/ml gentamycin. HT-115 were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 15%<br>
FBS and 1% P/S. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C, in the<br>
presence of 5% CO2.<br>
For cell growth assays, single-cell suspensions were plated at 2 x 103 cells/well (4 x<br>
103 cells/well for HT 115) in 96-well culture dishes in medium containing 0.5% FBS and<br>
allowed to adhere. The non-adherent cells were then removed, and fresh medium<br>
containing 0.5% FBS was added into each well. Cells were cultured in the presence or<br>
absence of the specified substances. Each substance was dissolved as a 25 mM stock<br>
solution in culture medium containing 0.5% FBS, and the pH of each stock solution was<br>
adjusted to 7.4, if necessary, with NaOH. Substances were used at a final<br>
concentration ranging from 0.5 to 10 mM.<br>
Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-<br>
deoxyuridine (BrdU) into DNA using a commercially available cell proliferation kit<br>
(Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy). BrdU was added to the cell cultures during the last 6<br>
hours of incubation, and the level of BrdU-positive cells was assessed after 48 h<br>
culture by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Optical density (OD) was<br>
determined at 450 nm using an ELISA reader. Experiments were performed in triplicate<br>
and the results are reported as the mean + standard deviation (SD).<br>
RESULTS<br>
The compounds differed in their ability to inhibit colon cancer cell growth. Results are<br>
summarized in Table 1 where the percentage of inhibition of growth of DLD-1 cells by<br>
the specified compounds is shown. The substance 20, exhibits a marked anti-<br>
proliferative effect in a dose-dependent fashion, in each of the three cell lines tested<br>
(Figures 3 &amp; 4). More than 90% of cell growth inhibition was seen when compounds<br>
were used at a final concentration of 10 mM. The ability of the compound 20 to<br>
significantly inhibit cell growth was seen when used at a final concentration of 5 or 10<br>
mM.<br><br>
The compounds 34 and 39 slightly reduced the cell growth when used at high doses<br>
(10 mM) (Figure 4), but differences among groups were not statistically significant.<br>
Similarly, no inhibition in cell growth was seen in cultures added with the substances<br>
35, and 40 (see Table 1).<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
This first set of examples of the invention (Example 10) shows the ability of four<br>
optimized molecules 34, 39, 35 and 40 at concentration of 1mM, to increase the<br>
PPARy activity in transfected HT-29 cells, displaying an activity similar or superior to 5-<br>
ASA at 30mM and rosiglitazone at 10"5M.<br>
The second set examples of the invention (Example 11) shows that the compounds<br>
affect the inhibition of the growth of the colon cancer cell lines, HT-29, HT-115 and<br>
DLD1 to varying degrees. The compounds differed in their ability to inhibit colon cancer<br>
cell growth. The substance 20, exhibits a marked antiproliferative effect on cell lines<br>
tested.<br>
These molecules of the present invention are also active on cells that do not<br>
express COX-2, and thus the molecules of the present invention may be used in<br>
cells which do not express COX-2 for the purposes of treating tumours and<br>
other applications as herein described.<br>
OVERALL CONCLUSIONS<br>
The synthesized highest ranking compounds, indicated from modelling studies, all<br>
show an activity similar/superior to that of mesalazine.<br><br>
