				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of novel macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers based on allyl glycidyl ether. The copolymers made by the process of this invention are useful as versatile copolymers for the preparation of affinity chromatography supports. The affinity chromatography supports are useful for the purification of industrial enzymes.<br>
Affinity chromatography supports are used in the isolation and purification of various enzymes. These materials are comprised of a rigid support of a specific particle size, pore size and its distribution. Further these supports provide a functional group on which a ligand can be linked. The ligands linked onto these supports display selective affinity interactions towards a particular enzyme. This recognition leads to specific binding of the enzyme of interest on to these supports through a ligand enzyme complex. The enzyme thus selectively bound is eluted by a subtle play of number of experimentally adjustable parameters.<br>
The requirements of an ideal support are :<br>
Insolubility, minimum non-specific adsorbtion hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, mechanical strength, chemical stability, larger surface area, optimal particle size, resistance to microbial attack, resistance to variations in temperature and pH, a functional group for linking of the ligand etc. as described in 'Affinity chromatography: practical and theoretical aspects, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1985; Journal of Chromatography, Vol. 218, p 241, 1981 and Chemcial Technology, vol. 5, p 564, 1975.<br>
The different supports that are used in the preparation of affinity supports are: agarose, cellulose, crosslinked dextrans, porous glass, copolymers of silica, polyacrylamide and polystyrene as described in Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 34, 1974.<br>
These supports suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages :<br>
1.	The supports need activation by using toxic chemicals like cyanogen bromide during derivatization with ligands.<br>
2.	They are susceptible to microbial attack.<br>
3.	These supports lead to bed compression during operation.<br>
4.	The supports are not chemically stable over a wider range of pH.<br>
5.	The supports retain appreciable quantities of water thereby leading to larger elution volumes.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel macroporous beaded crosslinked beaded copolymer supports.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of copolymer supports with an active functional epoxy groups readily available for reaction with ligand molecules.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of copolymer supports with an appropriate pore size distribution for affinity interactions of enzyme molecules with the ligands. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of copolymer supports, which are rigid, stable over a wider range of pH and resistant to microbial attack, so that longer operational life is achieved.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel macroporous beaded copolymers, which comprises of polymerizing allyl glycidyl ether and a crosslinking monomer such as herein described wherein amount of allyl glycidyl ether and the crosslinking monomer used is in the range of 5 to 95% and from 95 to 5% respectively , in an inert atmosphere selected from nitrogen or argon, in the presence of a protective colloid, a porogen and a polymerization initiator as defined herein , in an aqueous media, heating the polymerization reaction mixture at a temperature in the range of 60°C to 80°C for a period ranging from 2 to 4 hours, isolating the product by conventional methods, washing the resulting copolymer with water followed by a protic solvent as described herein and drying the resultant product at a temperature below 60°C to get the desired copolymer support.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the crosslinking monomer used is selected from ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinyl benzene, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerylthitol trimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the protective colloid used may be such as poly vinyl pyrrolidone, poly vinyl acetate, sodium salt of poly acrylic acid, poly vinyl alcohol.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the inert gas used is chosen from nitrogen or argon.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the polymerization initiator used may be such as azobis isobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the protic solvent used for the washing of the copolymer matrices may be selected from alkanols such as methanol, ethanol.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the protective colloid may be such as poly vinyl alcohol, salts of poly acrylic acid and poly methacrylic acid, poly vinyl pyrrolidone.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the porogen used may be such as decanol, octanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, preferably cyclohexanol.<br>
In a feature of the invention, the allyl glycidyl ether and the crosslinking monomer used may be in the range of 5 to 95 % and 95 to 5 % respectively.<br>
