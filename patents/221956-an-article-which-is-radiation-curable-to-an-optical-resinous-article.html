				<td>RADIATION CURABLE MICROSTRUCTURE-BEARING ARTICLES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to die replication of microstructure-bearing surfaces, and more particularly to a genus of resinous compositions capable of such replication.<br>
Microstructure replication in resinous surfaces is of importance in such diverse technical fields as the fabrication of traffic signs, in which reflectivity is provided by cube-comer embossed sheeting; the production of Fresnel ophthalmic lens elements and flexible video disks; and the fabrication of "brightness enhancement" or "light management" films (hereinafter sometimes designated "LMF" for brevity) for liquid crystal displays. For replication purposes, it is necessary that the resin have optimum physical properties, including a glass transition temperature (Tg) high enough for shape retention during storage and use and viscoelastic properties facilitating shaping, typically by molding, and long-term shape retention which includes the microstructure aspects of the shaped articles. Suitable viscoelastic properties include moduli in the glassy and rubbery states within certain ranges, as well as suitable transition temperatures between those states.<br>
Many suitable resinous compositions for the replication of microstructure are disclosed in the patent literature. A patent whose disclosure is generic to a large variety of such compositions is US Patent 4,576,850. The compositions described therein are characterized by "hard" and "soft" segments or moieties in combination with radiation-polymerizable moieties. Most often, all three of these types of segments are present in the same molecule. A key feature of the "hard" segments is the presence therein of cyclic (i.e., carbocyclic or heterocyclic) groups. Later-issued patents frequently make reference to 4,576,850 for its disclosure of suitable polymeric compositions and precursors therefor.<br>
It is of interest, however, to develop additional resinous LMF materials not disclosed in the above-identified patent or other publications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION; PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The optical resinous articles of the present invention are characterized by a surface with replicated microstructure comprising a plurality of utilitarian discontinuities, such as projections and depressions, which surface may be readily released from a mold after radiation curing without loss of the detail of the mold and with retention of the replication of such detail under a wide variety of conditions during use. The articles have a wide variety of desired properties, such as toughness, flexibility, optical clarity and homogeneity, and resistance to common solvents. The microstructures of such articles have high thermal dimensional stability, resistance to abrasion and impact, and integrity even when the articles are bent to an angle as great as 180°.<br>
The term "microstructure" is used herein as defined and explained in the aforementioned US Patent 4,576,850, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Thus, it means the configuration of a surface which depicts or characterizes the predetermined desired utilitarian purpose or function of the article having the microstructure. Discontinuities such as projections and indentations in the surface of said article will deviate in profile from the average center line drawn through the microstructure such that the sum of the areas embraced by the surface profile above the center line is equal to the sum of the areas below the line, said line being essentially parallel to the nominal surface (bearing the microstructure) of the article. The heights of said deviations will typically be about ± 0.005 to ± 750 microns through a representative characteristic length of the surface, e.g., 1-30 cm, as measured by an optical or electron microscope. Said average center line can be piano, concave, convex, aspheric or combinations thereof. Articles where said deviations are of low order, e.g., from ± 0.005 to ± 0.1 or, preferably, to ±0.05 microns, and said deviations are of infrequent or minimal occurrence, i.e., the surface is free of any significant discontinuities, are those where the microstructure-bearing surface is an essentially "flat" or " smooth" surface, such articles being useful, for example, as precision optical elements or elements with a precision optical interface, such as ophthalmic lenses. Articles where said deviations are of low order and of frequent occurrence include those having anti-reflective microstructure. Articles where said deviations are of high order, e.g., from ±0.1 to ± 750 microns, and attributable to microstructure comprising a plurality of utilitarian discontinuities which are the same<br>
or different and spaced apart or articles such as retroreflective cub e-comer and LMF's. The microstructure-b taring of both said low and high order extraneous or non-utilitarian discontinuities not significantly interfere with of said articles. It may be neces sary composition whose shrinkage extraneous discontinuities, e.g., a<br>
contiguous in a random or ordered manner, are sheeting, linear Fresnel lenses, video discs surface can contain utilitarian discontinuities . The microstructure-bearing surface may contain so long as the amounts or types thereof do or| adversely affect the predetermined desired utilities or desirable to select a particular oligomeric i|pon curing does not result in such interfering imposition which shrinks only 2-6%.<br>

Also incluc led are di(meth)acrylates of polyester polyols and oligomers thereof, as exemplified by such commercially available compounds as "CN-292", a low viscosity polye &gt;ter acrylate oligomer commercially available from Sartomer Co.<br>
Optional component C may alsc<br>
be an oligomeric urethane di(meth)acrylate. Such<br>
materials may be prepared, for ex imple, by the reaction of an alkylene diisocyanate of the formula OCN-R3-NCO with * diol of the formula HO-R4-OH, wherein each of R3 and R4 is independently a Ca-ioo Alkylene group, to form a urethane diol diisocyanate, followed by reaction with a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate. For example, a preferred compound of this type may be prepared from 2,2,4-trimethylhexylene diisocyanate, poly(caprolactone)diol and 2-hydf-oxyethyl methacrylate.<br>

Other important features of the articles formed by curing. These<br>
invention are the properties of the optical resinous include a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least<br>
35°C, preferably at least 40°C. Cured articles having glass transition temperatures lower than 35°C are not within the scope of the invention.<br>
Other preferred properties include a tensile strength in the range of about 70-700 kg/cm2, a modulus of elasticity in the range of about 140-14,000 kg/cm2, an elongation to break in the range of about 5-300%, an optical homogeneity of at least about 91% transmission, a haze value of less than about 5%, a birefringence of less than about 0.002 and a dynamic tensile modulus, E', that falls within the boundary of the area A-B-C-D in FIGURE 2. Said figure is a modified version of Figure 1 of the aforementioned US Patent 4,576,850, converting dynamic shear modulus (G1) in dynes/cm2 to dynamic tensile modulus in Pascals.<br>
The proportions of the components forming the curable articles of this invention may be widely varied, subject only to the Tg limitation and, preferably, one or more of the other preferred property profiles described hereinabove. Most often, components A and B each constitute about 1-98% by weight and component C, when present, about 5-75% of the article, based on total polymerizable components (usually the total of components A, B and C). Component D, the photoinitiator, is present in a minor amount effective to promote polymerization upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation, generally in the range of about 0.005-3.0% and preferably about 0.005-1.0% based on total polymerizable components.<br>
The radiation curable articles of mis invention may be prepared by simply blending the components thereof, with efficient mixing to produce a homogeneous mixture. It is often preferred to remove air bubbles by application of vacuum or the like, with gentle heating if the mixture is viscous, and casting or otherwise creating a film of the resulting blend on a desired surface. The film can then be charged to a mold bearing the microstructure to be replicated and polymerized by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, producing cured optical resinous articles of the invention having the aforementioned properties. If polymerized on a surface other than the one on which it is to be used, the optical resinous article can be transferred to another surface.<br>
Such a polymerization process lends itself to rapid, mass production of articles with no adverse environmental impact because no or only a minor amount of solvent or<br>
other volatiles are evolved and<br>
he polymerization can be carried out at ambient<br>
temperatures and pressures. The p rocess also lends itself to replication of articles with microstructure comprising utili arian discontinuities, such as projections and depressions, which are readily rel

solution. If the coating mixture was highly viscous, the temperature of the vacuum oven was increased to 50°C to facilitate the removal of air bubbles. Approximately one gram of the mixture was then poured into an aluminum pan 5 cm in diameter. The pan was tilted to spread the mixture across the entire bottom of the pan. If the mixture was viscous, the pan was placed in a circulating air oven set at 80°C to heat the mixture, which allowed for easier spreading of the mixture across the bottom of the pan. The spread and leveled solution was then polymerized by ultraviolet radiation in an ultraviolet processor. Two 600-watt bulbs were used with a belt speed of 12 ft./min, lamp to belt distance of 4 inches, and the coating was passed 10 times through the processor. A culture dish was placed upside down over the aluminum pan containing the coating in order to prevent the pan from being blown around on the belt.<br>
