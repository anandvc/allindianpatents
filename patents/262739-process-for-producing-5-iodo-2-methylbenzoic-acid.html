In the existing system as given in United States Patent Application - 7750182, wherein, the said invention provides a production method for an iodine compound in which iodine is reacted with a substrate in the presence of a porous material having a pore diameter of 500 nm or less or in the presence of the above porous material and an oxidizing agent and a production process for high purity 5-iodo-2-methyIbenzoic acid<br><br>
comprising an iodination reaction step carried out by the above-mentioned, a crystal precipitation and separation step in which a product is precipitated by adding water or cooling and then separated and a purification step in which crystal separated is recrystallized using an organic solvent. According to the production method for an iodine compound described above, iodine can be introduced into various substrates at a high selectivity. Since expensive metals and specific reagents do not have to be used, it can readily be carried out in an industrially scale, and the product having a high purity can be obtained. Further, the process comprising the iodination reaction, separation and purification steps described above makes it possible to readily obtain at a high yield, 5-iodo-2-methylbenzoic acid having a high purity which is useful in uses for functional chemical products such as medicines. The process of the present invention comprising iodination reaction, separation and purification steps is characterized by that it is simple in terms of a procedure and that the purification load is smaller, and it is very advantageous in industrially carrying out.<br>
In the existing system as given in United States Patent Application - 20090209785, wherein, the said invention provides a process for production of 2,3,4-trifluoro-5-(iodo or bromo)benzoic acid, the process comprising a halogenation step in which direct iodination or bromination of 2,3,4-trifluorobenzoic acid is performed with an iodinating agent or brominating agent in a reaction solvent in the presence of an oxidizing agent. According to the invention, there is provided a process for convenient production of 2,3,4-trifluoro-5-(iodo or BRomo)benzoic acid in high yield and high purity in a highly regioselective manner.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION - 5-IODO-2-METHYLBENZOIC ACID has the chemical formula C8H7IO2 and it can be produced in various ways. The original route starts with reaction with iodine compound, but yields from this starting point are low. Numerous processes and process improvements have been disclosed in prior art.<br>
However, some of the method involved earlier is evidently unsatisfactory, both economically and technically.<br>
