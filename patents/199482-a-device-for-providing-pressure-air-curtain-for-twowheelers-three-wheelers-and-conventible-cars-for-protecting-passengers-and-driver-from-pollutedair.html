				<td>This invention relates to a device for providing pressure air curtain for vehicles for protecting passengers and driver from polluted air.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Two wheelers, three wheelers and convertible cars available in the market do not provide any protection to passengers and driver sitting in the convertible car, three wheeler or on the two-wheeler from polluted air. Accordingly, the passengers and driver sitting in the convertible car, three wheeler or on the two wheelers feel uncomfortable particularly when the two-wheeler, three wheeler or the convertible car is waiting at the crossing or in the traffic for a longer period.<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a device for forming a pure pressure air curtain for two wheelers, three wheelers and convertible cars for protecting passenger and driver from polluted air even if the vehicle is waiting at a crossing or in traffic.<br>
To achieve the said objective, this invention provides a device for providing pressure air curtain for vehicles, protecting passengers / driver of car, three wheeler or two wheeler from polluted air comprising:<br>
a shield having perforation in the middle of front portion of said shield to be provided in front of the car, three wheeler or two wheeler,<br>
said shield in the middle has cool air entry louvers, air filter, air delivery section controlling velocity direction of air curtain, said louvers, air filter and air delivery section are connected one after the other in front of said perforations in said shield,<br>
an AC split unit / or desert cooler / being provided either in the front or at the rear of the vehicle for providing said cool air through said perforations of said shield.<br>
The said shield is made of transparent and bad conductor of heat plastic.<br>
The vehicle, two-wheeler or three-wheeler is provided with a fan mounted with battery on the front axle of the vehicle to provide air when the vehicle is not moving.<br>
The said AC split unit or desert cooler is operated with wind operated alternator.<br>
A water tank for desert cooler is mounted on the roof of the two or three wheelers.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a two-wheeler with a device for providing pure pressure air curtain for protecting passengers / driver from polluted air, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a three wheeler with a device for providing pure pressure air curtain for protecting passengers / driver from polluted air, according to this invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the convertible car with a device for providing pure pressure air curtain for protecting passengers / driver from polluted air, according to this invention.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Referring to figure 1, the two-wheeler (1) having a transparent shield (2) in front of the two wheeler. The said transparent shield (2) is having perforations (3). The said shield (2) is fixed on the front wheel of the two-wheeler. The said shield (2) in the middle just behind the perforations (3) has an air entry louvers (4), air filter (5) and air delivery section (6). The said louvers, air filter and air delivery section are connected one after the other in front of the perforations of said shield (2). Shield (2) is connected to shield (2A) to provide a cover to the driver.<br>
An AC split unit or desert cooler (7) is provided either in the front or at the rear of the vehicle for providing cool air through said perforations (3) in the shield (2). A fan with battery (not shown) is provided in the front wheel of two-wheeler to produce the air when the vehicle is not moving. The said air can also be provided when the air-condensing unit or desert cooler is only working on fan mode. The water tank (W) is provided on the two-wheeler for desert cooler.<br>
Figure 2 shows three wheeler having perforations (3) in the front. The said perforations has an entry louver (4), air filter (5) and air delivery section (6) connected one after the other in front of the perforations. An AC split unit or desert cooler is provided either in the front or at the rear of the vehicle. A fan (not shown) with battery is provided on the front wheel of three wheelers to produce air when the vehicle is not moving. A water tank (W) is provided on the roof of the two and three wheelers.<br>
Figure 3 shows the convertible car (8) with the device for providing pure pressure air curtain for protecting passengers / driver from polluted air. It may be seen from figure 3 that the transparent plastic shield (9) has in the middle air entry louvers (10) connected to air filter (11) and air delivery section (12). The AC split unit or desert cooler (13) is provided on one side of the shield (9) to provide cool air through louvers, filter and air delivery section. The said AC unit or desert cooler is operated with wind operated alternator.<br>
In convertible car, the pure air curtain (9A) with high pressure passes over the head of the passenger and the driver with high velocity. This air curtain does not permit any foreign matter to enter the vehicle where the passengers and driver are sitting. The said air curtain (9A) acts as a protecting layer for the passengers and driver. In two or three wheelers the air curtain (9A) is formed inside which prevents the polluted air to enter.<br>
The device will provide clean cool air to the passengers and driver<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br><br>
1.	A device for providing pressure air curtain for vehicles, protecting passengers / driver of car, three wheeler or two wheeler from polluted air comprising:<br><br>
-	a shield having perforation in the middle of front portion of said shield to be provided in front of the car, three wheeler or two wheeler,<br><br>
-	said shield in the middle has cool air entry louvers, air filter, air delivery section controlling velocity direction of air curtain, said louvers, air filter and air delivery section are connected one after the other in front of said perforations in said shield.<br><br>
-	an AC split unit / or desert cooler / being provided either in the front or at the rear of the vehicle for providing said cool air through said perforations of said shield.<br><br>
2.	A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said shield is made of transparent and bad conductor of heat plastic.<br><br>
3.	A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the vehicle or the two-wheeler or three wheeler is provided with a fan mounted with battery on the front axle of the vehicle to provide air when the vehicle, the two-wheeler or three wheeler is not moving.<br><br>
4.	A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said AC split unit or desert cooler is operated with wind operated alternator.<br><br>
5.	A device as claimed in claim 4 wherein water tank for desert cooler is mounted on the roof of the two or three wheelers.<br><br>
6.	A device for providing pressure air curtain for vehicles protecting passengers / driver from polluted air substantially as herein described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
