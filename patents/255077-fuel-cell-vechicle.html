[Title of the Invention]  FUEL-CELL VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel-cell vehicle that<br>
travels by electric power generated by supplying a reactive gas and a fuel gas to a fuel cell and in particular to a fuel-cell vehicle of a liquid cooling type in which the fuel cell is cooled with cooling water and the heat of the cooling water warmed by the fuel cell is dissipated by radiators.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Recently, a fuel-cell vehicle that travels by supplying electric power generated by a fuel-cell system to a motor and driving the wheels with the motor has been developed. In the fuel-cell system, a fuel-cell stack (hereunder referred to simply as "a fuel cell") generates electric power through the chemical reaction between hydrogen as a fuel gas and oxygen as a reactive gas. Here, the oxygen is taken in from the air via a compressor and the hydrogen is supplied from a high-pressure fuel gas container.<br>
[0003]<br>
Meanwhile, chemical reaction generates heat in a fuel-cell and in order to generate electric power efficiently, it is necessary to cool the fuel cell by dissipating excessive heat and to keep the fuel cell in an appropriate temperature range.  In order to dissipate heat efficiently, it is only necessary to cool a fuel cell by using a water-cooling type<br><br>
cooling system and to dissipate the heat of the warmed cooling water with a radiator, for example as a fuel-cell vehicle shown in Patent Document 1. [0004]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 192639/1996 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0005]<br>
In a water cooling system generally used, a pipe line is connected to a heater to be cooled and a radiator so that cooling water may circulate in between and the cooling water is circulated by a pump disposed in the middle of the pipe line. Here, in some cases, a cooling fan to send air to the fins of the radiator is disposed in order to improve the heat dissipation efficiency of the radiator. [0006]<br>
Meanwhile, as a means of driving a pump, an electric driving means that uses a built-in motor can be named.  However, there is a concern in such an electric pump that the motor generates heat, thereby the efficiencies of the motor and the electric pump itself are lowered, and resultantly the efficiency of the cooling system is lowered.  It is conceivable to cool the motor by introducing the circulated cooling water into the motor portion of the electric pump, but if such a means is applied, a more complex piping structure is required and also the thermal load of the cooling system increases. [0007]<br>
The present invention has been established in view of such<br><br>
problems and the object thereof is to provide a fuel-cell vehicle capable of inhibiting an electric pump from generating heat with a simple structure when the electric pump is used in a cooling system to cool a fuel cell. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0008]<br>
A fuel-cell vehicle according to the present invention, which travels by electric power generated by supplying a reactive gas and a fuel gas to a fuel cell and is provided with a liquid cooling system to cool the fuel cell, is characterized in that: the fuel-cell vehicle is equipped with a first radiator and a second radiator to dissipate heat and cool a coolant warmed by the fuel cell, cooling fans to ventilate the cooling fins of the first and second radiators respectively, and an electric pump, which is disposed in the middle of the pipe line of the cooling system, to circulate the coolant; and the electric pump is disposed at a place where the electric pump can catch the wind created by at least one of the cooling fans. [0009]<br>
By disposing an electric pump at a place where the electric pump can catch the wind created by a cooling fan as stated above, it is possible to inhibit the electric pump from generating heat with a simple structure. Moreover, since a coolant has nothing to do with the cooling of the electric pump, the thermal load of the cooling system does not increase. [0010]<br>
In this case, when the electric pump is located so that the projection thereof is in the projected area of the second<br><br>
radiator on a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fuel-cell vehicle, the air having passed through the second radiator during traveling is blown against the electric pump and thus the heat generation of the electric pump can be inhibited more reliably. [0011]<br>
Further, it is recommended that: the fuel-cell vehicle is a two-wheeled vehicle and is equipped with down frames being connected to a head tube at the front portions and descending in the rearward direction of the vehicle body; and the second radiator is located in the vicinity of the down frames. There is nothing, except a front wheel, to shield traveling up-wind in the vicinity of the down frames, thus the second radiator can receive the traveling up-wind in quantity, and the heat dissipation efficiency improves accordingly. [Effect of the Invention] [0012]<br>
A fuel-cell vehicle according to the present invention is equipped with, as a liquid cooling system, cooling fans to ventilate the cooling fins of a first radiator and a second radiator and an electric pump to circulate a coolant, and the electric pump is disposed at a place where the electric pump can catch the wind created by a cooling fan. Thereby, it is possible to inhibit the electric pump from generating heat and improve the cooling efficiency of the cooling system even with a simple structure and moreover the thermal load of the cooling system does not increase. [0013]<br><br>
Further, by locating the electric pump so that the projection thereof is in the projected area of the second radiator on a front view plane, the air having passed through the second radiator during traveling is blown against the electric pump and thus the heat generation of the electric pump can be inhibited more reliably. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0014]<br>
A fuel-cell vehicle according to the present invention is hereunder explained while embodiments are shown and the attached Figs. 1 to 6 are referred to.  Hereunder, with regard to twin structures; one on the left side and the other on the right side, in a two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10, those structures are explained separately with the character "L" attached to each of reference numerals in the case of a left side structure and the character "R" attached to the same in the case of a right side structure. [0015]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 to 3, a two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 of a scooter type as a fuel-cell vehicle according to the present embodiment has a fuel cell 12 and travels by using the electric power generated by the fuel cell 12. The fuel cell 12 generates the electric power by reacting a fuel gas (hydrogen gas) supplied to anodes with a reactive gas (air) supplied to cathodes. In the present embodiment, a known one is adopted as the fuel cell 12 and thus no detailed explanations are done here. The two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 is provided with: a front wheel 14 acting as a steering wheel; a rear wheel 16<br><br>
acting as a drive wheel; a handlebar 18 to steer the front wheel 14; frames 20; and a seat 22 which a rider and a passenger have. [0016]<br>
Also, the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 has a water cooling system 79 (refer to Fig. 5) in order to cool and keep the fuel cell 12 in an appropriate temperature range so as to be able to generate electric power efficiently. [0017]<br>
The frames 20 are provided with: a head tube 24 to support pivotally a fork-shaped front suspension 23 at the front portion; and a pair of upper down frames 26R and 26L and a pair of lower down frames 28R and 28L, those upper and lower down frames being connected to the head tube 24 at the front portion and descending in the rearward direction of the vehicle body. The frames 20 are further provided with: a pair of upper frames 30R and SOL extending continuously from the upper down frames 26R and 26L in the manner of ascending in the rearward direction of the vehicle body; a pair of lower frames 32R and 32L extending continuously from the lower down frames 28R and 28L toward the rear wheel 16; and a pair of vertical frames 34R and 34L connecting the rear end portions of the lower frames 32R and 32L to the substantially intermediate portions of the upper frames 30R and 30L. [0018]<br>
The fuel cell 12 is disposed substantially at the center portion of the vehicle body, more specifically at the rear portion in the region encircled by the upper frames 30R and 30L, the lower frames 32R and 32L and the vertical frames 34R<br><br>
and 34L, in the manner of slightly ascending in the rearward direction.  The fuel cell 12 is a relatively heavy part among the parts composing the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 and, by disposing it substantially at the center portion of the vehicle body, the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 can secure a good weight balance and the traveling performance improves. [0019]<br>
Further, at a position anterior to the fuel cell 12 in the region encircled by the upper frames 30R and 30L, the lower frames 32R and 32L and the vertical frames 34R and 34L, an electric pump 90 and others are disposed as it will be described later. The seat 22 is disposed above the upper frames 30R and 30L and tail lamps not shown in the figure are disposed at the rear end. [0020]<br>
The front wheel 14 is supported pivotally in a rotatable manner at the lower end of the front suspension 23. The handlebar 18 is connected to the upper portion of the front suspension 23 and a meter 38 is disposed in the center of the handlebar 18. The rear wheel 16 is supported by a swing arm 42 rotatable around a pivot 40 disposed at the vertical frames 34R and 34L and is provided with an in-wheel motor 44 and a motor driver 46 that drives the in-wheel motor 44 . The in-wheel motor 44 and the motor driver 46 are water-cooled and show a high efficiency and a high output. A rear suspension 48 is disposed under the fuel cell 12 in the manner of extending in the longitudinal direction of the fuel-cell vehicle and both the end portions are rotatably connected to the lower frames<br><br>
32R and 32L and the swing arm 42 respectively. A minimum ground clearance is stipulated for the fuel cell 12 in its design but, by disposing the rear suspension 48 under the fuel cell 12, the space between the fuel cell 12 and the ground can be used effectively and the center of the gravity of the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 can be lowered. [0021]<br>
Next, the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 is provided with, as a fuel cell system to generate electric power in the fuel cell 12 : a fuel gas container 50 to store a fuel gas supplied to the fuel cell 12 in a high pressure state; a resonator 54 to reduce the suction noise from an inlet 52 opening toward the rear direction; and an air cleaner 56 to take in the open air through the resonator 54. The inlet 52 is disposed on the upper face of the front portion of the resonator 54, bends mildly at an angle of about 90°, and opens in the rear direction. [0022]<br>
The two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 is further provided with: a compressor (called also a supercharger or a pump) 58 to compress the air purified in the air cleaner 56 and make a reactive gas; an intercooler 59 to cool the reactive gas compressed in the compressor 58; a humidifier 60 to exchange moisture between the reactive gas supplied to the fuel cell 12 and the used reactive gas exhausted from the fuel cell 12; a backpressure valve 62 disposed at the exhaust side of the humidifier 60 in order to regulate the pressure in the interior of the fuel cell 12; a dilution box 64 to dilute the used reactive gas with the used oxygen gas; and a silencer 66 to silence the<br><br>
diluted reactive gas and exhaust it as the exhaust gas in the open air.  Further, the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 is equipped with a secondary battery (not shown in the figure) disposed in the vicinity of the front folk as the auxiliary electric source of the fuel cell system. [0023]<br>
The fuel gas container 50 has a columnar shape with hemispheres on both the ends and is disposed at a rear portion of the vehicle body in a manner of deviating from the center to the right side.  More specifically, the fuel gas container 50 extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body in the top view (refer to Fig. 3) and is disposed in the manner of ascending in the rearward direction along the seat 22 and the upper frame 30R in the side view (refer to Fig. 1) .  The fuel gas container 50 is a relatively large part among the parts composing the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 but, by disposing it so as to deviate from the center line, it scarcely overlaps the rear wheel 16 in the top view and thus the upward and downward suspension stroke of the rear wheel 16 can be secured sufficiently.  Thereby, it becomes easier to mitigate the impact from a road and thus it becomes possible to improve the ride quality of the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10. [0024]<br>
The dilution box 64 is disposed at the bottom end of the pair of the lower down frames 28R and 28L in between and located at a portion lower than the fuel cell 12. Hence, the dilution box 64 is likely to accumulate moisture generated in the fuel cell 12 and the accumulated moisture is exhausted from the lower<br><br>
portion of the dilution box 64. [0025]<br>
A first exhaust pipe 70 is connected to the dilution box 64 and the exhaust gas is discharged from the first exhaust pipe 70. The first exhaust pipe 70 is disposed so that it extends from a portion somewhat anterior to the center of the lower frame 32L toward the rear direction through the interior of the lower frame 32L and the rear end thereof is connected communicatively to an end of a second exhaust pipe 72. The second exhaust pipe 72 bends somewhat above the rear end of the lower frame 32L, runs in the manner of obliquely ascending in the rearward direction, and is connected to the silencer 66. [0026]<br>
The silencer 66 has a substantially square vertically flat shape, is disposed so as to deviate from the center to the left at a rear portion of the vehicle body, and extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle at a position higher than the rear wheel 16. An outlet 66a through which the exhaust gas from the silencer 66 is discharged is disposed at the lower portion of the rear end of the silencer 66 . The outlet 66a is located at a position somewhat posterior to the axle 16a of the rear wheel 16 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. [0027]<br>
Since, as explained above, the outlet 66a is located at a position higher than the rear wheel 16 and moreover posterior to the axle 16a thereof in the anteroposterior direction, the<br><br>
exhaust gas discharged from the outlet 66a is diffused rearward by the traveling up-wind and discharged in the region 74 hatched by the chain double-dashed lines as shown in Fig. 4. As a consequence, the rear wheel 16 is not directly exposed to the water vapor (or moisture) contained in the exhaust gas. Further, even when the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 travels at a small turning radius, the water vapor diffuses obliquely rearward and the rear wheel 16 is never exposed thereto. [0028]<br>
The resonator 54 has a substantially square vertically flat shape and is disposed on the right side of the fuel gas container 50.  The rear end of the resonator 54 is connected to the rear end of the air cleaner 56 through a resin pipe 75. [0029]<br>
The air cleaner 56 has a somewhat flat shape and is disposed so as to ascend in the rearward direction under the rear portion of the fuel gas container 50 . The air having passed through the air cleaner 56 is introduced into the right end portion of the compressor 58 through a short resin pipe 76. The compressor 58 is disposed so as to extend in the direction of the vehicle width and the right end portion is located under the center portion of the fuel gas container 50 . The humidifier 60 is long in the direction of the vehicle width and disposed between the compressor 58 and the fuel cell 12. [0030]<br>
The intercooler 59 is disposed under the front portion of the fuel gas container 50 and the air inlet and air outlet are connected to the compressor 58 and the humidifier 60,<br><br>
respectively.  The intercooler 59 cools the air compressed by the compressor 58 and supplies it to the humidifier 60 as described above but, at the time of startup in a cold climate, by switching a bypass valve 78, the compressed air can be supplied to the fuel cell 12 without passing through the intercooler 59 and the humidifier 60. [0031]<br>
Next, the water cooling system 79 to cool the fuel cell 12 and keep it in an appropriate temperature range is explained with reference to Fig. 5. [0032]<br>
The cooling system 79 is provided with: a first radiator 80 and a second radiator 82 to dissipate heat with the cooling fins and cool the cooling water warmed by the fuel cell 12; a cooling fan 84 to ventilate the cooling fins of the first radiator 80; two cooling fans 86 and 88 to ventilate the cooling fins of the second radiator 82; an electric pump 90 to circulate the cooling water; a thermostat 92 to switch the circulation path of the cooling water at the time of warm-up operation or in a supercooled state; and an ion exchanger 94 to remove ions in the cooling water and prevent the earth of the fuel cell 12. As it is understood from Figs. 1 and 2, the electric pump 90 is disposed on the downstream side of the cooling fan 88. [0033]<br>
The cooling fans 84, 86 and 88 are located on the backside of the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82 and suck air from the radiators respectively, and the air flows as shown by the arrows A.  Among the wind shown by the arrows A, the wind<br><br>
created by the cooling fan 88 is so designed as to blow against<br>
the electric pump 90.<br>
[0034]<br>
The electric pump 90 is equipped with a motor 90a, the pump part is operated by electrically rotating the motor 90a, and thus the cooling water can circulate in the cooling system 79. The inlet 90b of the electric pump 90 is connected to the cooling water outlet 12a of the fuel cell 12 through a pipe line 96a, and the outlet 90c of the electric pump 90 is connected to the cooling water outlet 12a of the fuel cell 12 through a pipe line 96b. [0035]<br>
The lower portion of the first radiator 80 is connected to the upper portion of the second radiator 82 through two pipe lines 96c and 96d allocated right and left, respectively (refer to Fig. 6). One end of the thermostat 92 is connected to the lower portion of the second radiator 82 through a pipe line 96e, and the other end thereof is connected to the cooling water inlet 12b of the fuel cell 12 through a pipe line 96f . The pipe line 96b between the electric pump 90 and the first radiator 80 branches to form a pipe line 96g and the pipe line 96g is connected to the thermostat 92. The pipe line 96a between the fuel cell 12 and the electric pump 90 branches to form a pipe line 96h and the pipe line 96h is connected to the thermostat 92 through the ion exchanger 94. Gas venting portions are provided for the fuel cell 12 and the ion exchanger 94 respectively though they are not shown in the figure, and a hydrogen sensor is provided for the pipe line 96a though it<br><br>
is not shown in the figure. [0036]<br>
At the time of warm-up operation or in a supercooled state, the thermostat 92 connects the pipe line 96g to the pipe line 96f communicatively and blocks off the pipe line 96e. Thereby, the cooling water discharged from the electric pump 90 flows in the pipe line 96g and is not routed through the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82. As a result, the cooling water is not unnecessarily cooled and rapid warm-up can be secured. [0037]<br>
Meanwhile, at normal operation, the thermostat 92 connects the pipe line 96e to the pipe line 96f communicatively and blocks off the pipe line 96g.  Thereby, the warmed cooling water discharged from the electric pump 90 is cooled by heat dissipation at the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82 and thereafter introduced into the cooling water inlet 12b of the fuel cell 12 through the thermostat 92 .  The cooling water warmed by cooling power generation cells (not shown in the figure) in the fuel cell 12 is discharged through the cooling water outlet 12a, introduced into the electric pump 90, and circulated.  Further, some of the cooling water circulates through the ion exchanger 94. [0038]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the first radiator 80 has a substantially square tabular shape and is disposed in front of the head tube 24, and the cooling fan 84 is disposed behind the first radiator 80. The second radiator 82 has a tabular shape and is substantially twice of the first radiator 80 in<br><br>
both height and area, and is disposed right in front of the lower down frames 28R and 28L in the manner of following the lower down frames 28R and 28L. The cooling fan 86 is disposed behind the upper part of the second radiator 82 and the cooling fan 88 is disposed behind the lower part of the second radiator 82. The electric pump 90 is disposed between the cooling fan 88 and the fuel cell 12. [0039]<br>
Since the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82 do not overlap each other on a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, they tend to catch traveling up-wind effectively when the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 is traveling and can dissipate heat and cool the cooling water passing through the interior.  Further, the cooling fans 84, 86 and 88 function so as to suck the air through the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82 and send the air rearward, accelerate the ventilation of the cooling fins of the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82, and thus can cool the cooling water more reliably. [0040]<br>
In a two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 configured as above, as shown in Fig. 6, the electric pump 90 is located so that the projection thereof is in the projected area of the second radiator 82 on a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the fuel-cell vehicle and, when the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 travels, the air having passed through the second radiator 82 blows against the electric pump 90. The electric pump 90 is equipped with the motor 90a and, when the<br><br>
motor 90a generates heat, the efficiencies of the motor 90a and the electric pump 90 lower. However, in the case of a two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 according to the present embodiment, since the air having passed the second radiator 82 exerts cooling action on the electric pump 90, the temperature rise of the motor 90a is inhibited.  Thereby, the efficiencies of the motor 90a and the electric pump 90 are inhibited from lowering and the amount of the circulating cooling water is secured.  Hence, the efficiency of the cooling system 79 is prevented from deteriorating. [0041]<br>
Since the electric pump 90 is located in the projected area of the second radiator 82, the so-called frontal projected area does not increase and thus the air resistance of the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 during traveling does not increase either. [0042]<br>
Further, since the electric pump 90 is located at a position where it receives the wind created by the cooling fan 88, it is subjected to so-called forced air cooling and hence the efficiencies of the motor 90a and the electric pump 90 are further inhibited from lowering. [0043]<br>
The electric pump 90 receives mainly the wind created by the nearby cooling fan 88, but in practice a cowling is mounted on the two-wheeled fuel-cell vehicle 10 and therefore at least a part of the wind created by the cooling fans 84 and 86 passes through the inside of the cowling, blows against the electric<br><br>
pump 90, and accelerates cooling. [0044]<br>
Further, the wind having cooled the electric pump 90 blows against the fuel cell 12 located at the back, thus the fuel cell 12 is also subjected to forced air cooling, and the power generation efficiency can be improved. [0045]<br>
Here, since the electric pump 90 is located under the lee of the second radiator 82, neither the electric pump 90 affects the wind which the second radiator 82 receives at the front nor the air cooling of the electric pump 90 causes the heat dissipation efficiency of the second radiator 82 to lower. The electric pump 90 is not water-cooled but air-cooled and hence the electric pump 90 does not cause the heat load of the cooling system 79 that is water-cooled to increase. [0046]<br>
As it is obvious from Fig. 6, since the second radiator 82 is located in the vicinity of the lower down frames 28R and 28L, there is nothing to shield the traveling up-wind except the front wheel 14, the second radiator 82 can receive the traveling up-wind in large quantity, and thus the heat dissipation efficiency of the cooling system 79 improves. [0047]<br>
Here, levers, cowlings and others are not shown in Figs. 1 to 4 and 6. Further, in Fig. 3, the handlebar 18 and the meter 38 are not shown so that the frames 20 and others are visible. [0048]<br>
Though the above explanations have been done on the<br><br>
premise that the cooling system 79 is of a water cooling type, a liquid cooling type such as an oil cooling type or the like may be adopted. With regard to the cooling fans 84, 86 and 88, though the explanations have been done on the basis of the type of sucking air at the back of the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82, a type of sending air from the front side of the first radiator 80 and the second radiator 82 may be adopted, for example. [0049]<br>
It is a matter of course that a fuel-cell vehicle according to the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiments but may take various configurations without deviating from the tenor of the present invention. [Brief Description of the Drawings] [0050]<br>
