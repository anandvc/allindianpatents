				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a lid with sealing foil for a can for foodstuff, paint and<br>
so on, which lid comprises :<br>
a ringlike base part defining an opening;<br>
a sealing foil arranged on the base part and covering the opening;<br>
a lip arranged with one end to the foil for tearing the foil; and<br>
retaining means for retaining a free end of the lip adjacent the<br>
sealing foil.<br>
PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND:<br>
US Patent 5,797,509 is incorporated in this description by way of reference. The<br>
novel, inventive and advantageous feature of the present invention over US<br>
5,797,509 is that sealing with adhesive and its heat treatment has been<br>
dispensed with in the present invention. Also, seal is tamper proof.<br>
Such a lid is used for cans, which comprise for example milk powder. These<br>
cans are filled under low pressure, such that the sealing foil of the lid will bend<br>
inside which causes the lip to bend up from the sealing foil. This causes<br>
problems during the further handling of such a can. The lip could get stuck<br>
between parts of a handling machine or influence the functioning of the<br>
machine.<br>
Such cans could also be sterilized. As a result of this, the sealing foil puffs up, by<br>
which again the lip bends away from the sealing foil.<br>
Currently, this bending of the lip is prevented by glueing the lip to the sealing<br>
foil. The glueing process has a number of disadvantages. First of all it is an<br>
expensive process, which is difficult to control. When the can is used for<br>
foodstuff, the flue has to be approved to be used for application in the food<br>
industry. Secondly the glue has to fulfil a number of requirements, such as a<br>
high temperature stability, especially when the lid is sterilized, a low tearing<br>
force, as the sealing foil has to be able to be removed easily. A third<br><br>
disadvantage of the glueing process is that the application of the glue has its<br>
speed limitation. The glue has always a rather high viscosity, which restricts the<br>
speed of application.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a lid according to the preamble, which<br>
eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages.<br>
This object is achieved by a lid according to the invention, which is characterized<br>
in that the retaining means comprise a first retaining part being part of the<br>
sealing foil and a second retaining part being part of the lip.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As both the first and second retaining part are part of respectively the sealing foil<br>
and the lip, no additional material has to be added in order to provide the<br>
retaining means. A robust connection of the lip to the sealing foil is provided. Tis<br>
prevents bending of the lip, which could influence further handling of the lid.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the first and second retaining part have a<br>
shape defined connection. So due to the shape of both retaining parts, the<br>
connection is accomplished. There is no need for any frictional forces or<br>
adherents such as with a glue connection.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the first and second retaining<br>
parts each comprise a projection which engage with each other.<br>
Preferably the projections have a substantially T-shaped cross-section.<br>
By this T-shaped cross-section, both the first and second retaining parts have a<br>
shape defined connection. The T-shape of the first part will engage into the T-<br>
shape of the other part. Only by deformation<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention the method comprises the step<br>
of stamping a profile into the sealing foil. This foil<br>
provides for a neat surface of the sealing foil, without<br>
any folds.<br>
Preferably the stamping, pressing and butting<br>
are performed in one stroke. This will provide a very<br>
quick way of nanufacturing a lid according to the<br>
invention.<br>
These and other features of the invention will<br>
be elucidated in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows an upper view of a lid according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a bottom ^iew of the lid<br>
according to :.igure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view of the lid<br>
according to :igure 1 taken along the line III-III.<br>
Fig ires 4A and 4B show two steps of a method<br>
according to ;he invention.<br>
Figures 5A and 5B show a cross-sectional view<br>
of the deformation accomplished with the steps according<br>
to figure 4A and figure 4B.<br>
In figures 1 and 2 a lie 1 according to the<br>
invention is shown. This lid comprises a ring-like base<br>
part 2 which defines an opening 3. A sealing foil 4 is<br>
arranged ontc the ring-like base part 2 covering the<br>
opening 3. The sealing foil 4 is ssealingly arranged to<br>
the base part 2.<br>
Integral with the sealing foil 4 a lip 5 is<br>
provided. This lip 5 is attached to the sealing foil 4<br>
through a retaining means 6, which resembles a rivet.<br>
In figure 3 a cross-sectional view of the lid<br>
according to figure 1 is shown. Clearly can be seen that<br>
the ring-like base part 2 defines an opening 3 onto which<br><br>
the sealing foil 4 is arranged. The lip 5 is integral<br>
with the sealing foil 4 and folded back onto the sealing<br>
foil 4. The lip 5 and the sealing foil 4 are connected by<br>
retaining means 6, which consists of a first T-shaped<br>
protrusion 7 which is arranged in a second T-shaped<br>
protrusion 8. Due to the T-shape the retaining action is<br>
accomplished.<br>
In :igure 4A a tool 10 is shown with which a<br>
connection of a lip with a sealing foil can be achieved.<br>
The tool 10 has a lower die 11 and an upper die 12, On<br>
the upper die 12 a pressing member 13 is slidedly<br>
arranged and put under pressure by a spring 14.<br>
The sealing foil 4 and the lip 5 are brought<br>
onto the lower: die 11. The upper die 12 together with the<br>
pressing member 13 is brought down onto the sealing foil<br>
4 and the lap 5. The pressing member 13 will contact the<br>
lip 5 first through which a protrusion is pressed into<br>
the materia;, of the foil and the lip (see figure 5A) .<br>
After this protrusion is formed into both the sealing<br>
foil 4 and the lip 5, the upper die 12 is brought down<br>
further with :orce, such that the bottoms 15. 16 of the<br>
protrusions are butted. This causes the material of the<br>
bottoms 15, 15 to flow, such that the thickness of the<br>
bottoms 15, 15 reduces, but that the area A increases.<br>
This provides a T-shaped protrusicn which connects both<br>
the sealing foil 4 and the lip 5.<br>
The lip can only be disconnected from the<br>
sealing foil 4 by deforming the material of the lip 5. As<br>
this deformation is visible, this lid according to the<br>
invention pro/ides also a tamper proof.<br><br>
