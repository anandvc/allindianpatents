rhe present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 3,5-diarylpyrazoles of the general formula I<br><br>
where the substituents have the following meanings:<br>
R1 and R3 are unsubstituted or substituted aryl radicals,<br>
R2 is hydrogen, C1-C8-alkyl or unsubstituted or substitued aryl.<br>
3,5-Diphenylpyra2ole can be prepared by reaction of diphenylpropane-1,3—dione (dibenzoylmethane) with hydrazine hydrate, which is described, for example, in US 3,882,142.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction of benzylideneacetophenone dibromide v/ith hydrazine hydrate leads to 3 5—diphenylpyrazole (Freudenberg, Stoll, Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. ,- 440 (1924), 45),<br>
Other possibilities of preparation are dehydrogenations of 3,5-diphenylpyrazolines by, for example, catalytic dehydrogenation according to US 4,014,896, US 3,952,010 a:id DE 24 41 504.<br>
The appropriate pyrazolines can be obtained by reacting chalcones (1,3-diarylpropenones, eg. benzylideneacetophenone) with hydrazine hydrate in alcoholic solution (Kishner Zh. Russ. Fiz.-Khim. 0-va 47 (1915) 1102; Centralblatt, 1916 I, 1063).<br>
A further possibility of synthesis of 3,B-diphenylpyrazoline is the reaction of phenylphenylacstylenylcarbinol with hyrazine hydrate (Stoll, Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem., 440 (1924), 39, 42).<br>
In addition to the preparation of pyrazoles by dehydrogenation of 3,5—disubstitued pyrazolines, .US 4,014,896, US 3,952,010 and DE 24 41 504 also describe the synthesis of the latter by reaction of 1,3—disubstituted propenones with hydrazine hydrate. The procedure used here is in general one in which a methyl aryl ketone, eg. acetophenone, is reacted with benzaldehyde in methane in the 6resence of bases to give the corresponding<br><br>
1,3—disubstituted propenones which, <br>
ac,ids, react with hydrazine hydrate to give the desired<br>
pyrazolines.<br>
EP 402 722 discloses a further process for preparing pyrazole by dehydrogenation of 2-pyrazoline.<br>
Since the pyrazole syntheses described are multistage syntheses, the object was therefore to make 3,5-diarylpyrazoles accessible in a technically simpler and more economical manner.<br>
Accordingly, a process has been found for preparing 3,5-diarylpyrazoles of the general formula I<br><br>
where the subscituents have the following meanings:<br>
R1 and R3 3J-P, nnsuhstituted or substituted aryl radicals, R2 is hydrogen, C1-C8-alkyl or unsubstituted or substitured aryl, in which hydrazine hydrate is reacted with a 1,3—diarylpropenone of the general formula II<br><br>
where the substituents R1, R2 and R3 have the abovementioned meanings, in sulfuric acid in the presence of iodine or an iodine compound.<br>
It has furthermore been found that instead of 1,3—diaryl-propenones of the general formula II, their starting compounds, a carbonyl compound of the general formula III<br><br><br>
where the substituents R1, R2 and R3 have the abovementioned meanings, can be used.<br>
The reaction proceeds in a one-pot process.<br>
The 1,3—disubstituted pyrazoline formed from hydrazine hydrate and the appropriate 1,3—diarylpropenone of the formula II or its starting substances, the carbonyl compound of the formula III and arylaldehyde of the formula IV, is dehydrogenated in the reaction mixture to the corresponding 3,5—diarylpyrazole by the iodine formed from hydrogen iodide and sulfuric acid, corresponding amounts of sulfur dioxide being liberated by the oxidation of hydrogen iodide to iodine by sulfuric acid. The reactants hydrazine hydrate and 1,3—diarylpropenone of the formula II or their starting substancec, the carbonyl compound of the formula III and arylaldehyde of the formula IV, are reacted in stoichiometric amount, IL being possible to employ the rcactantc .n an excess or insufficient amount.<br>
?he sulfuric acid, which is employed as an oxidant and also as a iiluent, is in general employed in a from 0.5— to 10—fold excess, where the sulfuric acid should be present in a concentration of not less than 30% by weight, preferably of from 45 to 95% by weight.<br>
Iodine or the iodine compound is in	general	employed in the<br>
reaction in amount of from.  0.01 to	10 mol%	per mole of the<br>
hydrazine employed, preferably from	0.05 to	5 mol% and in<br>
particular from 0.1 to 2 mcl%.<br>
In addition to elemental iodine, iodine compounds such as hydrogen iodide, alkali matal and alkaline earth metal iodides such as lithium iodide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, cesium iodide, magnesium iodide and calcium iodide and also other metal iodides are suitable; other inorganic iodine compounds such as alkaline earth metal and alkali metal hypoiodides, iodites.<br><br>
metal iodiaes, eg. methyl iodide, can also be used.<br>
This one-pot reaction is in general carried out at normal pressure at from 50°C to 250°C, preferably at from 70°C to 200°C, in particular at from 90°C to ITO'c. The reaction can also be carried out at elevated pressure and also under reduced pressure. The reaction can also be carried out stepwise such that the formation of 1,3—diarylpropenone is first carried out at from 20°C to 100°C in sulfuric acid, it being possible for the amount of sulfuric acid needed for complete reaction to be initially introduced completely or partly. The reaction mixture is then reacted with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of iodine and possibly of additional sulfuric acid at from 50°C to 150°C, preferably at from 70°C to 200°C, in particular at from 90'c to 170°C.<br>
The reaction is in general carried out such that all the reaction components are combined in the reaction vessel and then jointly heated to the reaction temperature. However, the reactants, apart from sulfuric acid, can also be introduced separately or as a mixture into preheated sulfuric acid/Nal solution or some of the reactants can be initially introduced at the reaction tem.perature and the other reactants added at a higher temperature. The water of reaction is distilled off during the reaction.<br>
The diarylpyra^ole formed precipitates even at reaction temperature and can "be completely crystallized by cooling. The ^material from the reaction can be neutralized by addition of ' dilute sodium hydroxide solution. The neutralization of the sulfuric acid present in the reaction mixture can be dispensed with, however, because the 3,5-diarylpyrazoles do not form any salts with sulfuric acid under these conditions. The reaction suspension therefore can also be diluted by addition of water alone and filtered. The diarylpyrazoles are obtained in high yield and purity.<br>
The process according to the invention is suitable for preparing 3,5-diarylpyra2oles of the general formula I<br><br><br>
5<br>
where the substituents have the following meanings:<br>
R1 and R3 are unsubstituted or substituted aryl radicals,<br>
R2 is hydrogen, C1-C8-alkyl or unsubstituted or substituted aryl.<br>
Unsubstituted or substituted aryl includes phenyl and substituted phenyl. Suitable substituted phenyl includes phenyl substituted by C1-8-alkyl, C1-C8-alkoxy, halogen, nitro, sulfonic acid, C3-C8-cycloalkyl or allyl.<br>
With respect to the novel process, it is particularly preferred to carry out the reaction in the form of a one-pot reaction without isolating one of the intermediates. In this case the reaction is expediently carried out in such a way that 1,3-diarylpropenones of the formula II or the carbonyl compounds of the formula III and arylaldehydes of the formula IV are simultaneously reacted, separately or as a mixture, with the stoichiometric amount of hydrazine hydrate or with an excess or insufficient amount of hyrazine hydrate under the conditions outlined above in sulfuric acid in the presence of iodine or an iodine compound.<br><br>
T<br>
In the process according to the invention, it is of little importance for yield and purity in which sequence the reactants are added, ie. the carbonyl compound of the formula III and arylaldehyde of the formula IV can be initially introduced in sulfuric acid, the corresponding 1,3-diarylpropenones of the formula II being formed, and hydrazine hydrate added.<br>
Likewise, hydrazine hydrate can be initially introduced into sulfuric acid and the diarylpropenone of the formula II or a mixture of its starting substances, the carbonyl compound of the formula III and arylaldehyde of the formula IV, added. In just the same way, 1,3-diarylprcpenones or mixtures of carbonyl compounds of the formula III and arylaldehydes of the formula IV and hydrazine hydrate can be introduced separately, simultaneously or in succession into the sulfuric acid brought to ^i— ^„„„^^j,^,,^^ which is treated with Nal, and reacted. The<br><br>
iodine or iodine compound catalyst can be initially introduced or added during the reaction.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing 3, 5-diarylpyrazoles of the general formula I<br><br>
wherein R' and R^ aie phenyl or phenyl substituted by CpCs-alkyl, Ci-Cs-alkoxy, halogen, nitro, sulfonic acid, Cs-Cs-cycloalkyl or allyl and R^ is hydrogen, CpCg-alkyl, phenyl or phenyl substituted by CpCs-alkyl, CpCg-alkox&gt;', halogen, nitro, sulphonic acid, Cs-Cs-cycloalkyl or allyl, which comprises reacting hydrazine hydrate with a carbonyl compound of the general formula III <br>
and an arylaldehyde of the general formula IV<br><br>
wherein the substituents R1, R2 and R3 have the above mentioned meanings, in sulfuric acid in the presence of iodine or an iodine compound selected from the group consisting of hydrogen iodide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal iodides, alkaline earth metal and alkali metal hypoiodides, iodites, iodates, periodates and methyl iodide; and recovering the compound of formula I in a known manner.<br><br><br><br><br>
