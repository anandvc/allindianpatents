A ZEOLITIC MATERIAL TIQ-6, A MICROPORQUS MATERIAL METIQ-6 ANE PROCESSES FOR PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is encompassed in the field of catalytic materials and, more specifically, in the field of zeolitic catalytic materials.<br>
STATE OF THE ARTPRIOR TO THE INVENTION<br>
In the epoxidation of olefins methods are known, in which organic hydropezroxides arc utilised and which are carried out employing catalysts based on titanium anchored on siliceous supports  (US-A-3923843,  1375),  An adequate selection of the reagent on titanium and also of the anchoring conditions permit catalysts to be obtained in which the titanium centres are separated and immobilised, reducing  or  rather  cancelling  the  possibilities  of deactivation of the catalyst through dinerisation of the titanium species. However, these catalysts can, during the catalytic process,  suffer a loss of titaniun content by extraction during the reaction which leads to the activity of the catalyst diminishing with time.<br>
To overcome this drawback, it has been proposed that the titanium, species be anchored on mesoporous silicas (T. Maschmeyer et. Al,, Nature, 378, 159 (1995)), In this case, determined amounts of titanium. of the order of 8% by weight can be anchored presenting good results as catalysts in epoxidation of olefine using organic peroxides as oxidising agents.   Unfortunately  the  amorphous  nature  of  these mesoporous silicas and the high concentration and proximity of oilinol groups result in these materials being of  low stability and to achieve adequate dispersions of the active titanium species on the surface of the mesoporous material proves to be problematic.<br><br>
2<br>
The methods and materials of the state of the art therefore suffer from a series of drawbacks that it vould be convenient to overcome.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present: invention is to overcome the drawbacks in the state of the art, by means of a catalyst and by means of a procedure for the preparation thereof, making use of a material with an external high surface area and which shows in its structure active species, as for example, titanium and/or zirconium in tetrahedral positions which have been incorporated directly during the synthesis without carrying out any post-synthesis anchoring treatment, the activity and selectivity obtained in oxidation reactions being very high.<br>
Likewise, the present invention has a further object a modification of the surface area which gives rise to the formation of organic species bound to the surface which notably improve the activity and selectivity of these materials when they are used as catalysts.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

m has a value between 0.00001 and 0.25, preferably between 0.001 and 0.1, X is Al, Ga or B,<br>
x has a value between 0 and 1, and a has a value between 0 and 2.<br>
Preferably both the zeolitic TIQ-6 material and the microporous METIQ-6 material, car. have a specific external surface area greater than 500 m2g-1 a pore volume greater than 0.5 cm3g-1, and a charge transfer band in the visible-ultraviolet spectrum in the range between 200 and 230 nm.<br>
According to the invention, the TIQ-6 material may or may not be subsequently modified by means of a treatment with reagents selected among orqanogermanes, organosilanes, organometale and combinations thereof, in order to produce organic species anchored on the surface of the materials described, giving rise to the METIQ-6 material.<br>
The  TIQ-6  material  can  be  obtained  from  laminar<br><br>
4<br>
precursors of zeolites synthesised vith titanium and/or<br>
zirconium  which  is  incorporated  directly  into  its<br>
structure. More specifically, a delaminated TIQ-6 material<br>
ia obtained, similar to the material ITQ-6, both proceeding<br>
from  the  laminar  precursor  of  Ferrierite  (FER),  the<br>
preparation of which is indicated in the Spanish Patent<br>
P98016B9   (1998)   and  in  the patent  application<br>
PCT/GB99/025G7 (1999). The catalytic material obtained has<br>
Si-O-M bonds (M=Ti or 2r) , the active species-of titanium<br>
or zirconium being distributed in a homogeneous manner in<br>
order  that  they be  functional  in  selective  oxidation<br>
processes of organic compounds with organic or inorganic<br>
peroxides, and in general in processes which involve the<br>
use of Lewis acid centres.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, the TIQ-6 material can be prepared by means of a procedure which comprises.<br>
A first step wherein a laminar precursor is synthesised of the ferrieritic type with a strycture which comprises at least one of Ti and Zr;<br>
A second step wherein the laminar precursor is submitted to a swelling with a long-chain organic compound; in order to obtain a swollen laminar material;<br>
A third step wherein the swollen laminar material is at least partially, delaminated using techniques of mechanical stirring, ultrasounds, spray drying, liophilisation and combinations thereof;<br>
A fourth step wherein the at least partially delaminated material is subjected to an acid treatment;<br>
A fifth step wherein the at least partially delaminated material is subjected no calcination until at least part of the organic matter present in the material is eliminated in order to obtain a calcinated material.<br>
In this process, the laminar precursor can be prepared by means of<br><br>
5<br>
a mixing step which comprises mixing, in an autoclave, a silica source, a titanium and/or zirconium source, a fluoride salt and acid, a structure director organic compound, and water until a mixture is obtained;<br>
a heating step wherein the mixture is heated at autogenous pressure to between 100 and 200°C, preferably less than 200°C, with stirring, for 1 to 30 days, preferably between 2 and 15 days, until a synthesis material is obtained; and<br>
a final step wherein the synthesis material is filtered, washed and dried at a temperature less than 3009 C until the laminar precursor is obtained.<br>
In the procedure described above, preferably use is made of a source of silica as pure as possible, Adequate silica sources are commercially available, for example under the trade names of AEROSIL (DEGUSSA AG), CAB-O-SIL (SCINTRAN BDH), LUDOX (DU PONT  PRODUCTS); use can also be made of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and also combinations of various different sources of silica.<br>
The titanium source can be selected among TiCl4 tetraethylorthotitanate (TEOTi) and combinations thereof, and the 2irconium is selected from between ZrCl4, zirconyl chloride and combinations thereof.<br>
As fluoride salt and acid, it is possible to use ammonium fluoride, hydrogen fluoride or combinations thereof.<br>
The structure director organic compound is selected preferably between 1, 4-diaminabutane, ethylendiamine, 1,4-dimethylpiperazine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, hexamethylen imine, pirrolidine, piridine and preferably 4-amino-2, 2, 6, 6-retramethylpiperidine and combinations thereof.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the zeolitic METIQ-6 material can be obtained by means of a reaction with reagents selected among organogermahes, organosilanes, and organometale selected among organotitanium or organotin in order to produce organic species anchored on the surface of the materials described, at a reaction temperature between<br><br>
6<br>
0 and 4002 C, preferably in gas phase between 50 and 200° C, of the TIQ-6 material, for so to produce organic species anchored on the surface of the materials described. Thus, for said reaction to produce organic species anchored on the surface an agent can be employed selected among R1R2R3(R')Y, R1K2(R)2Y R1R')3Y, R1R2R3Y-NH-YR1R2R3, and combinations thereof, wherein<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are selected among hydrogen, alkyl groups with 1 to 22 carbon atoms, aryl groups with 6 to 36 carbon atoms, aromatic groups with 6 to 36 carbon atoms, polyaromatic groups with 6 to 36 carbon atoms, said groups being selected between groups identical and different from each other, and selected in turn between non-functionalised groups and functionalised groups with functional groups selected among acid, araino, thiol, sulphonic and tetra-alkyl ammonium groups,<br>
R' is a hydrolysable group at a temperature between 0 and 4002 c, selected from between alcoxide, halide, and trimethyllsililamino. Such halide groups can come from compounds like for example, methyltrichlorogermane, iodopropylrrimerhoxysilane, zitanocene dichloride, methyltrichlorotin, diethyldichlorosilane and methyl criethoxysilane. Such alcoxide groups can be for example ethoxide, methoxide, propoxide or butoxide, such trimetthylsililamino groups can come from compounds like for example hexamethyldisilazane.<br>
Y is at least one element selected from Si, Ge, Sn, Ti,<br>
According to the invention, the reaction to produce organic species anchored on the surface can be carried our in the absence of solvents, but also by dissolving the TIQ-6 material in a solvent selected between organic solvents and inorganic solvents. Likewise the silanisation can be carried out in the absence of catalysts or in the presence of at least one catalyst which favours a reaction of an alkyleilane, alkylgermane or organometallic compound in general with Si- groups.<br><br>
7<br>
In  accordance with  the  invention,  the  zeolitic material TIQ-6 may be prepared as follows: in a first step the synthesis of the laminar precursor is carried out by-mixing in an autoclave a source of silica like for example AEROSIL, CAB-O-SIL, LUDOX, texraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), or any other known; a source of titanium and/or zirconium like for example Ticl4, tetraethylorthotitanare (TEOTi), ZrCl4 zirconyl chloride or any other known; some fluoride compounds like for example ammonium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride;  an  organic  compound  like  1,4-diaminobutane, ethylendiamine,        1, 4-dimethylpiperazine,        1,4-diaminocyclohexane,    hexamethylenimine,    pirrolidine, piridxne       and       preferably       4-amino-2, 2, 6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and water in adequate proportions. The synthesis takes place at temperatures between 100 and 200oC, with constant stirring of the gel and lasting 1 to 30 days, preferably between 2 and 15 days. At the end of this time, the reaction product, a white solid, is washed with distilled water, filtered and dried.<br>
The sheets of the obtained precursor, which contain citanium and/or zirconium in their framework, are separated by intercalating voluminous organic species such as alkyl ammoniums, amines, esters, alconols, dimethylformamide, eulphoxides, urea, chlorohydrates of amines, alone or mixtures thereof in solution. The solvent is generally water, but other organic solvents can also be used such as alcohols, esters, alkanes, alone or mixtures thereof in absence or in presence of water.<br>
More specifically, when cetyltrimethylaminonium bromide (CTHATBr-) is employed for example, as swelling agent, the intercalation conditions are as follows: the laminar precursor is dispersed in an aqueous solution of CTMATBr-and a cetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxide or an alkaline or alkaline-earth hydroxide, being preferred tetra-alkyl ammonium hydroxides like tetrapropylammononium hydroxide (TPATOH-), the pH of the mixture being greater than 11. The<br><br>
8<br>
resulting dispersion is heated to temperatures between 5 and 200°C during periods between 0.5 and 90 hours whilst the  suspension  is  vigorously  stirred.  The  suspension resulting is dispersed in an excess of water, being stirred with a metal paddle of the Cowles type or any other known at speeds lying between 20 and 2000 rpm during periods not less than 1 hour. These conditions are sufficient to carry out the delamination of the precursor material. However, it is possible to employ other delamination methods such as for  example  treating  the  sample  with  ultrasounds, liophiXisation and spray-drying.<br>
Once the delamination has been carried out, the solids are separated and thoroughly washed in order to eliminate the excess CTMA+Br-. The obtained product is dried and is calcinated at a temperature sufficient to eliminate the organic matter occluded in the material, or at least the organic matter present on the material surface.<br>
The materials obtained are characterised in that they have a high external surface area greater than 500 m2g-1 and a pore volume greater  than  0.5  cm3g-1.  They are likewise  characterised  in  that  they  have  a  highly hydroxylated surface as may be deduced from the presence of a very intense band in the IR spectrum centered at about 3745 cm-1. Moreover the ultraviolet-visible spectrum of the TIQ-6 materials which contain Ti or Zr are characterised by the presence of an MIV-O charge transfer band between 2 00 and 220 nm.<br>
This product containing Ti and/or Zr is active and selective in oxo-cransference reactions and more specifically for epoxidation of olefins, oxidation o£ alkanes and alcohols, hydroxylation of aromatics, ammoximation of ketonee, oxidation of organic sulphides and sulphoxides with organic or inorganic peroxides. Thus for example, the material termed TIQ-6 prepared from a laminar precursor of ferriericic type, containing between 0.125 and 3% by weight of TiO2 is capable of epoxidating the 1-hexane<br><br>
9<br>
at 50°C with conversions of 20% and selectivities to the epoxide of 96% after seven hours of reaction using hydrogen hvdroperoxide (H2O2) as oxidant, acetonitryl and/or methanol as solvent and 2% by weight of TIQ-6 as catalyst.<br>
On the other hand, to obtain the microporous METIQ-6 material from the zeolitic TIQ-6 material, the TIQ-6 material can be treated with reagents selected among organogermanes, organosilanes, and organometals selected among organotitanium or organotin. By means of this process to produce organic species anchored on the surface it is possible to add one or more groups which incorporate carbon-tetravalent element bonds in the zeolitic material. This reaction for incorporating these groups is carried out using compounds with formula R1R2R3 (R')Y, R1R2(R')2Y, R1(R')3Y or R1R2R3Y-NH-YR1R2R3 in which R1, R2 and R3 are organic groups identical to or different from each other, and can be H or the alkyl or aryl groups mentioned earlier and Y is a metal among which Si, Ge, Sn or Ti are preferred. The procedures to produce organic species anchored on the surface are well known in the state of the art, in this manner the greater part of the Si-OH and M-OH groups present in the TIQ-6 material are functionalised.<br>
The TIQ-6 and METIQ-6 materials can be employed as catalysts in<br>
the epoxidation of define, wherein an olefin, for example selected among propylene, ethylene, isoprene, norbornene, limonene, a-pinene, terpinolene, longifolene, cariofilene, c-cedrene, styrene, substituted stirenes, fatty esters and acids, allyl alcohols and vinyl alcohols, is subjected to epoxidation with an organic or inorganic hydroperoxide, as for example terabutylhydroperoxide, hydroperoxide of curnene or hydrogen peroxide; * oxidation of alcohols, in which an alcohol is subjected to oxidation with a hydroperoxide selected between     organic     hydroperoxidee     and     inorganic<br><br>
10<br>
hydroperoxides, in order to obtain a ketone, aldehyde or an<br>
acid from the alcohol;<br>
oxidation of organic thiols  to  the  corresponding<br>
sulphoxides  and sulphons with a hydroperoxide  selected<br>
between    organic    hydroperoxides    and    inorganic<br>
hydroperoxides;<br>
hydroxylation   of   aromatic   compounds   with   a<br>
hydroperoxide selected between organic hydraperoxides and inorganic hydroperoxides;<br>
* ammoximation of ketones with a hydroperoxide selected between organic hydroperoxides and inorganic hydroperoxides.<br>
Thus for example, a METIQ-6 material containing between 0.125 and 3% by weight of TiO2 is capable of epoxidaring the 1-hexene at 50 9 c with conversions of 18% and selectivities to the epoxide of 99% after seven hours of reaction using hydrogen hydroperoxide (H2O2) as oxidant, acetonitryl and/or methanol as solvent and 2% by weight of METIQ-6 as catalyst.<br>
MODES OF EMBODIMEHT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples illustrate characteristics applicable to the preparation of the TIQ-6 and METIQ-6 materials and of their applications as catalysts in oxidation processes.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
PREPARATION OF THE LAMINAR PRECURSOR OF THE TIQ-6 MATERIAL 10 g of silica (AEROSIL 200, Degussa) are added to an aqueous solution containing 9.2 g of ammonium fluoride (NH4F, Aldrich 98% purity), 3,4 g of hydrofluoric acid (HF, 46.1% purity) 26 g. of 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (FLUKA, 98% purity), 0.8 g of titanium tetraethoxide (Alfa, 98% purity) and 20.2 g of deionised water (MilliQ Quality of Millipore). The synthesis gel pH is 9, This reactive mixture is vigorously stirred for two hours at room temperature before placing it into an autoclave at 135°C for 10 days. The resulting solid<br><br>
11<br>
is filtered, thoroughly washed with water to a pH close to 7 and dried at 60°C for 12 hours. The obtained laminar precursor shows a Si/Ti ratio of 50 measured by chemical analysis. EXAMPLE 2<br>
DELAMINATION OF A FERRIERYTIC LAMINAR PRECURSOR FOR OBTAINING THE TIQ-6 MATERIAL<br>
1 g of the laminar precursor described in example 1 is<br>
dispersed in a solution containing 4 g of MilliQ water, 20<br>
g of cetyltrimethyl ammonium hydroxide and 6 g of tetra-<br>
propyl ammonium hydroxide, and the final pH is 12.5. These<br>
hydroxides  were  prepared  by  ion  exchange  of  their<br>
respective bromide salts using DOWEX SBR resin. The bromide<br>
exchange level in both cases was approximately 70%.<br>
The resulting dispersion was heated to 80°C for 16 hours with constant,  vigorous stirring to favour the separation of the sheets making up the precursor material. Once this time has elapsed, the resulting suspension is filtered to remove the excess of CTMA+Br- and the solid is dispersed in an excess of water and subjected to an ultrasounds treatment for one hour. HCl is then added (6M) to pH=3 to favour the solid's flocculation.  The latter is recovered  by  centrifuging  and  thoroughly  washed  with distilled water. The final solid is dried at 60°C for 12 hours and roasted at 580°C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 3 hours, the heat treatment being extended for 7 more hours in air, and all organic material hidden in the solid's pores is completely eliminated. The product gives a Si/Ti ratio of 100 measured by chemical analysis.<br>
This  material  (TIQ-6)  shows  a  specific  area  of approximately 650 m2g- and a pore volume of 0.7 cm3g-1.<br><br>
12<br>
EXAMPLE 1 PREPARATION OF THE METIQ-6 MATERIAL<br>
Silanization of the TIQ-6 material, giving rise to the material  called  METIQ-6,  is  carried  out  by  making organosilane  compounds  to  react  on  the  surface  of  a material like that described in example 2. This process is usually performed in the following manner; 3 g of the TIQ-6 material described in example 2 are dehydrated at 300°C and vacuum of 10-3 torr for 2 hours. A solution is added to this solid, containing 1-9 g of trimethylchlorosilane in 27 g of chloroform. The resulting: suspension is vigorously shaken for 1 hour under an argon atmosphere, and then 1.28 g of triethylamine dissolved in 3 g of chloroform are added.  This suspension is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature and is filtered, washed with dichloromethane and dried at 60°C for 12 hours.<br>
This material shows no significant nor structural nor<br>
textural differences with the TIQ-6 material described in<br>
example  2.  The  visible  ultraviolet  spectrum  of  this<br>
material shows a narrow band of 220 nm assigned to the<br>
formation of monomeric titanium species. The presence of<br>
Si-CH3 groups is evidenced by the presence of a band in the<br>
IR spectrum at 1410 cm-1  and a resonance line in the<br>
spectrum of 29Si-MAS-RMN at 15 ppm.<br>

TIQ-6 MATERIAL CONTAINING Ti IN ITS COMPOSITION, IN THE 1-<br>
HEXENE EPOXIDATION<br>
The catalytic activity of the material prepared in example 2 for 1-hexene epoxidation is described in this example.<br>
300 mg of the material described in example 2 are placed into a glass reactor at 50°C which contains 1420 mg<br><br>
13<br>
of 1-hexene, 4S0 mg of H2O2 (at 35% P/P) and 11800 mg of acetonitryl or inethanol as a solvent. The reaction mixture is stirred and a reaction sample is taken after 7 hours. Under these conditions, the conversion of l-hexene achieved with respect to the maximum possible is 20% with a 96% epoxide selectivity.<br>
