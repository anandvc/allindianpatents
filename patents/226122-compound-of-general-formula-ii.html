				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Science (2000), 288, 1425-1429.<br><br>
In particular, the overexpression of the different forms of cdc25 is now reported in numerous series of human tumors:<br>
-	Breast cancer: cf. Cangi et al, Resume 2984, AACR meeting San Francisco, 2000);<br>
-	Lymphomas: cf. Hernandez et al., Int. J. Cancer (2000), 89, 148-152 and Hernandez<br>
etal., Canc-erRes. (1998), 58, 1762-1767;<br>
-Cancers of the neck and head: cf. Gasparotto et al., Cancer Res. (1997), 57, 2366-2368.<br>
Moreover, E. Sausville's group reports an inverse correlation between the level of expression of cdc25-B in a panel of 60 lines and their sensitivities to CDK inhibitors, suggesting that the presence of cdc25 can bring a resistance to certain antineoplastic agents and more particularly to CDK inhibitors (Hose et al., Proceedings of AACR, Abstract 3571, San Francisco, 2000).<br>
Among other targets, the pharmaceutical industry is therefore at present researching compounds capable of inhibiting the Cdc25 phosphatases in order to use them in particular as anti-cancer agents.<br>
The Cdc25 phosphatases also play a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (cf. Zhou et al., Cell Mol. Life Sci. (1999), 56(9-10), 788-806; Ding et al., Am. J. Pathol. (2000), 157(6), 1983-90; Vincent et al., Neuroscience (2001), 105(3), 639-50) in such a manner that it is also possible to envisage using compounds possessing an inhibition activity on these phosphatases in order to treat these diseases.<br>
Another problem addressed by the invention is research into medicaments intended to prevent or treat the rejection of organ grafts or also to treat auto-immune diseases. In these disorders/diseases, the non-appropriate activation of lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages is involved. The immunosuppressive medicaments known at present have side effects which could be diminished or modified by products specifically targeting the signalling pathways in hematopoietic cells which initiate and maintain inflammation.<br>
The CD45 phosphatase plays a crucial role in the transmission of signals from receptors on the T lymphocytes by regulating the phosphorylation and the activity of the tyrosine kinases of the src family, the negative regulation sites p56iclc and p59fyn of which it is capable of dephosphorylating.<br><br>
The CD45 phosphatase is therefore a potential target in the treatment of immune diseases. In fact, the blocking of the CD45 phosphatase by an anti-CD45 antibody inhibits the activation of the T lymphocytes in vitro (Prickett and Hart, Immunology (1990), 69. 250-256). Similarly, the T lymphocytes of transgenic mice not expressing CD45 (CD45 knockout mice) do not correspond to stimulation by an antigen (Trowbridge and Thomas, Annu. Rev. Immunol. (1994), 12, 85-116).<br>
Moreover. CD45 would be capable of dephosphorylating a sub-unit associated with Lyn, which would trigger a flow of calcium and activation of the mastocytes. Hamaguchl et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2000), 10, 2657-2660) have shown that a particular CD45 inhibitor (with an 1C50 equal to 280 nM) would suppress the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mastocytes and would protect mice from anaphylactic shock.<br>
The advantage of finding CD45 phosphatase inhibitors would therefore appear obvious in particular when there is interest in:<br>
obtaining an immunosuppressive effect in general, and in particular:<br>
•	within the scope of the treatment of auto-immune diseases (Zong et al.,<br>
J.  Mol. Med. (1998), 76(8), 572-580) such as for example multiple<br>
sclerosis      or     autoimmune      encephalitis      (Yacyshyn      et     al.,<br>
Dig. Dis. Sci. (1996), 41(12), 2493-8) and diabetes (Shimada et al.,<br>
J. Autoimmun. (1996), 9(2), 263-269);<br>
•	within the scope of the treatment of transplant rejections;<br>
in the treatment of inflammation in general, and in particular:<br>
•	within the scope of the treatment of arthritis (Pelegri et al., Clin. Exp.<br>
Immunol.   (2001),   125(3), 470-477), rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic<br>
diseases, conjunctivitis (Iwamoto et al., Graefes Arch. Clin. Opthalmol.<br>
(1999), 237(5), 407-414) and pruritic diseases;<br>
« within the scope of the treatment of digestive inflammatory diseases such as for example Crohn's disease (Yacyshyn et al., Dig. Dis. Sci. (1996), 41(12), 2493-2498), haemorrhagic rectocolitis and hepatitis (Volpes et al., Hepatology (1991), 13(5), 826-829); and<br>
-     in the treatment of allergies (Pawlik et al., Tohoku J. Exp. Med. (1997), 182(1), 1-8).<br><br>
The invention offers novel cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors (in particular cdc25-C phosphatase inhibitors), and/or CD45 phosphatase inhibitors, which are derivatives of benzothiazole-4,7-dione and benzooxazole-4,7-dione corresponding to the general formula (I) defined hereafter. Given the above, these compounds are capable of being used as medicaments, in particular in the treatment of the following diseases/disorders:<br>
•	inhibition of tumorous proliferation alone or in combination with other treatments;<br>
•	inhibition   of normal   cell  proliferation   alone   or   in   combination  with   other<br>
treatments;<br>
•	neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease;<br>
•	prevention of spontaneous alopecia;<br>
•	prevention of alopecia induced by exogenous products;<br>
•	prevention of radiation-induced alopecia;<br>
•	prevention of spontaneous or induced apoptosis of normal cells;<br>
•	prevention of meiosis and fertilization;<br>
•	prevention of the maturation of oocytes;<br>
•	all the diseases/all the disorders corresponding to uses reported for CDK inhibitors,<br>
and in particular non-tumorous proliferative diseases (for example: angiogenesis,<br>
psoriasis or restenosis), tumorous proliferative diseases, parasitology (proliferation<br>
of protozoans), viral infections, neurodegenerative diseases, myopathies;<br>
•	all the diseases/all the disorders corresponding to clinical uses of vitamin K and its<br>
derivatives;<br>
•	autoimmune  diseases  such as  for example multiple  sclerosis  and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis; and<br>
•	diabetes.<br>
Moreover, the compounds of the present invention are also, due to their cdc25 phosphatase inhibition properties, capable of being used to inhibit the proliferation of microorganisms, in particular yeasts. One of the advantages of these compounds is their low toxicity on healthy cells.<br>
A certain number of derivatives of benzothiazole-4,7-dione and benzooxazole-4,7-dione are already known.<br>
In particular, the patent GB 1 534 275 relates to herbicides, the active ingredient of which is a compound corresponding to one of the general formulae<br><br><br>

In the PCT Patent Application WO 99/32115, the term "electron-donor substituent" refers to a functional group having a tendency to donate electron density; the substituents alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl are mentioned. In this Patent Application, "electron-attracting substituents" always refers to a functional group having a tendency to attract electron density; the cyano, acyl, carbonyl, fluoro, nitro, sulphonyl and trihalomethyl substituents are mentioned. Finally, an "electron-modulating substituent" is defined in this Application as a functional group having a tendency to modulate the electron density, which can both attract and donate electrons and is therefore such that it can stabilize a cationic intermediate in an aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction; a functional group is mentioned, including, for example, amino (for example -NHj, alkylamino or dialkylamino), hydroxy, alkoxy or aryl substituents, heterocyclic substituents, halogen atoms, etc.<br>
The compounds of general formula (A3) are presented as ryanodine receptor modulators which can be used as pesticides or therapeutic agents, for example in the treatment of congestive cardiac failure, migraine headaches, hypertension, Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease or in the prevention of miscarriage.<br>

In certain cases, the compounds according to the present invention can comprise asymmetrical carbon atoms. As a result, the compounds according to the present invention have two possible enantiomeric forms, i.e. the "R" and "S" configurations. The present invention includes the two enantiomeric forms and all combinations of these forms, including the "RS" racemic mixtures. In an effort to simplify matters, when no specific configuration is indicated in the structural formulae, it should be understood that the two enantiomeric forms and their mixtures are represented.<br>
According to a particular variant of the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) are compounds of general formula (I)'<br>

General Method<br>
Generally, the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared according to the procedure summarized in Diagram 1 below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Diagram 1<br>
According to this method, the compounds of general formula (1), in which R1, R2, R3, R and W are as described above, are obtained by treating the compounds of general formula (A), in which L represents a methoxy radical, a halogen atom or a hydrogen atom and RJ, R4 and W have the same meaning as in general formula (I), with amines of general formula NR]R2H in a protic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, at a temperattire comprised between 0°C and 50°C and optionally in the presence of a base such as, for example, diisopropylethylamine (Yasuyuki Kita et al., J. Org. Chem. (1996), 61,223-227).<br>
In the particular case where the compounds of general formula (A) are such that L and RJ each represent a halogen atom, the compounds of general formula (I) can be<br><br>
obtained in the form of a mixture of the 2 position isomers, but it is then possible to separate them by chromatography on a silica column in an appropriate eluent.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (I) in which RJ represents a halogen atom (Hal) can be obtained. Diagram la, from the compounds of general formula (I) in which R' represents a hydrogen atom, for example, by the action of N-chlorosuccmimide or N-bromosuccinimide in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran (Paquette et Farley, ./. Org. Chem. (1967), 32, 2725-2731), by the action of an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) in a solvent such as acetic acid (Jagadeesh et al., Synth Commun. (1998), 28, 3827-3833), by the action of Cu(IJ) (in a CuCl2/HgCl2 mixture) in the presence of a catalytic quantity of iodine in a solvent such as warm acetic acid (Thapliyal, Synth. Commun. (1998), 28, 1123-1126), by the action of an agent such as benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate in the presence of NaHCO3 in a solvent such as a dichloromethane / methanol mixture (Kordik and Reitz, J. Org. Chem. (1996), 61, 5644-5645), or also by using chlorine, bromine or iodine in a solvent such as dichloromethane (J. Renault, S. Giorgi-Renaultetal.,.7. Med. Chem. (1983), 26, 1715-1719).<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (I) in which RJ represents an alkoxy or alkylthio radical can also be obtained, Diagram Ib, from the compounds of general formula (I) in which R represents a halogen atom, for example, by the action of an alcohol of general formula R -OH or of a thiol of general formula R -SH (R being such that R3 ----- R3 O or RJ S) in a solvent such as anhydrous ethanol in the presence of a base such as, for example, diisopropylethylamine.<br><br><br>
Diagram \b<br><br>
oj [the intermediates pj_ general formula (A)<br>
The compounds of general formula (A) in which L, RJ, R4 and W are as defined above can be obtained, Diagram 2, starting from the compounds of general formula (B) in which L, R"', R and W are as defined above and:<br>
-	one of Q and Q' represents an amino or hydroxyl radical and the other represents a<br>
hydrogen atom; or<br>
-	Q and Q1 each represent an amino radical; or<br>
-	Q and Q' each represent a hydroxy radical; or finally<br>
-	Q and Q' each represent a methoxy radical.<br><br><br><br>
Diagram 2<br>
In the case where the compounds of general formula (B) are such that Q and Q' represent methoxy radicals, the compounds of general formula (A) are obtained by treatment with cerium (IV) and ammonium nitrate (Beneteau et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. (1999), 34( 12), 1053-1060). In the other cases, the compounds of general formula (A) are obtained by oxidation of the compounds of general formula (B), for example by use of FeCh in an acid medium (Antomni et al., Heterocycles (1982), 19(12), 2313-2317) or Fremy's salt (potassium nitrosodisulphonate). (Ryu et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2000), 10, 461-464), or by the use of a reagent comprising a hypervalent iodine such as [bis(acetoxy)iodo]benzene or [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene in aqueous acetonitrile at a temperature preferably comprised between -20°C and ambient temperature (i.e. approximately 25°C), and preferably at approximately -5°C (Kmugawa et al., Synthesis, (1996), 5, 633-636).<br>
In the particular case where L and R3 represent halogen atoms, the compounds of general formula (A) can be obtained, Diagram 3, by halogen oxidation of the compounds ol" general formula (B) in which L and R represent hydrogen atoms and Q and/or Q1 is (are) chosen from an amino radical and a hydroxy radical by the action, for example, of potassium or sodium perchlorate in an acid medium (Ryu et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (1999), 9, 1075-1080).<br><br>

Preparation ofjhe intermediates^ of general formula (B)<br>
Certain compounds of general formula (B) in which L, RJ, R4, Q, Q' and W are as defined above are known industrial products available from the usual suppliers.<br>
If they are not commercially available and in the particular case where Q or Q' represents an amino radical, the compounds of general formula (B) can in particular be obtained from the nitro derivatives of formula (B.ii) in which Q or Q' represents a nitro radical by reduction methods which are well known to a person skilled in the art such as, for example, hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst or treatment with tin chloride in hydrochloric acid. If they are not commercially available, the compounds of formula (B.ii) can themselves be obtained from the compounds of general formula (B.i) in which the positions corresponding to the Q and Q' radicals are substituted by hydrogen atoms by nitration methods which are well known to a person skilled in the art such as, for example, treatment with a mixture of nitric acid and sulphuric acid (cf. Diagram 4 where only the case in which the compounds of general formula (B) are such that Q = NH2 and Q' = H is represented).<br><br>
Diagram 4<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (B) which are not commercially available in which Q represents an amino radical, Q' a hydrogen atom and W an oxygen atom, can be obtained by treatment of the tetrahydrobenzoxazoles of general formula (B.vi) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in order to produce the oximes of general formula (B.v). themselves treated with warm polyphosphoric acid (cf. Young Kook Koh et al., J. Heterocydic Chem. (2001), 38, 89-92) to provide the compounds of<br>
-44-<br>
general formula (B). The compounds of general formula (B.vi) can themselves be obtained from the cyclic 1.3-diketones of general formula (B.viii) firstly by conversion to diazodiketones of general formula (B.vii) by diazotransfer reaction, for example, by the action of tosyl azide or 4-acetamidobenzene sulphonyl azide in the presence of triethylamine in a solvent such as anhydrous dichloromethane or chloroform (V. V. Popic et ai.. Synthesis (1991). 3, 195-198) followed by cycloaddition of these diazodiketones of general formula (B.vii) with the nitriles of general formula R4-CN in the presence of a rhodium-type catalyst (II) (Y. R. Lee, Heterocycles (1998), 48, 875-883)(cf. Diagram 4a).<br>

If they are not commercially available and in the particular case where Q represents hydroxyl, 0' a hydrogen atom and W an oxygen atom, the compounds of general formula (B) can be obtained by aromatization of the oxazolocyclohexanones of general formula (B.vi). Such aromatization can be carried out in two stages as shown in Diagram 4b, firstly a halogenation in position a of the carbonyl (which leads to the intermediates of general formula (B.ix) in which Hal is a halogen atom), then (3-elimination of the halogen by treatment with a base. The halogenation can be done, for example, using bromine in acetic acid at ambient temperature, pyridinium tribromide in acetic acid at 50°C, copper bromide (II) in ethyl acetate or acetonitrile under reflux, or also phenylselenyl chloride in ethyl acetate at ambient temperature. The elimination of the resultant halide can be carried out by diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature or by lithium carbonate in dimethylformamide. Examples of these reactions are provided by M. Tany et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. (1996), 44, 55-61; M.A. Ciufolmi et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1995), 117, 12460-12469; andM.E. Jung and L.S. Starkey, Tetrahedron (1997), 53, 8815-8824.<br>

If they are not commercially available and in the particular case where R4 represents a CMj-NR^'R"2 radical, the compounds of general formula (B) can be obtained. Diagram 5, from the compounds of general formula (B.iii) in which R4 represents the methyl radical, which is subjected firstly to a radical brommation reaction using vV-bromosuccinimide in the presence of an initiator such as 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) or dibenzoyl peroxide in an aprotic solvent such as carbon tetrachloride (CC14) at a temperature preferably comprised between ambient temperature (i.e. approximately 25°C) and 80°C and under irradiation by a UV lamp (Mylari et al., ./. Med. Chem. (1991), 34, 108-122), followed by substitution of the intermediate of general formula (B.iv) by amines of formula HNR21R~2 with R~ and R" being as defined above.<br>

Diagram 5<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (B) which are not commercially available in which R4 represents a -CH2-NR21R22 radical can be obtained according to the method represented in Diagram 4 above, starting from the compounds of general formula (B.i) in which R4 represents a -CH2-NR21R22 radical, these being themselves obtained from the compounds of general formula (B.i) in which R4 represents a CH2-Br radical by substitution with amines of formula HNR R with R and R as defined above.

Bodansky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis. 145 (Springer-Verlag, 1984)), for example in tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane or dimethylformamide in the presence of a coupling reagent such as cyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), IJ'-carbonyldiimidazole (GDI) (J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35(23), 4464-4472) or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Coste et al., Tetrahedron Lett. (1990), 31, 205).<br>
The compounds of general formula (B) in which R4 represents -CH^-COOH can be obtained from the compounds of general formula (B) in which R4 represents the -CHa-COOR radical in which R1 represents an alkyl radical by hydrolysis of the ester function under conditions known to a person skilled in the art.<br>

Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. I (1999), 437-442). The compounds of general formula (B.x) can themselves be obtained by starting from the corresponding acylated 2,5-dimethoxyanilines of general formula (B.xii), for example by the action of an acid chloride of general formula R4COC1 or a carboxylic acid of general formula R4COOH activated according to methods known to a person skilled in the art, in order to produce the N-(2,5-dimemoxyphenyl)amides of general formula (B.xi) themselves converted to the thioamides of general formula (B.x) by the action of Lawesson's reagent in toluene at reflux.<br>

Pharmacological study of the compounds of the invention<br>
Test protocols<br>
i) Measurement of the phosphatase activity of the purified Cdc25C recombinant enzyme<br>
The phosphatase activity of the MBP-Cdc25C protein is evaluated by dephosphorylation of 3-O-methylfluorescein-phosphate (OMFP) to 3-O-methylfluorescein (OMF) with determination of the fluorescence of the reaction product at 475 nm. This test allows identification of the inhibitors of cdc25 recombinant enzyme. The preparation of the fusion protein MBP-cdc25C is described in PCT Patent Application WO 01/44467.<br>
The reaction is carried out in 384-well plate format in a final volume of 50 ul. The MBP-Cdc25C protein (prepared as described above) is stored in the following elution buffer: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 250 mM NaCl; ImM EDTA; 1 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT); iOmM maltose. It is diluted to a concentration of 60 uM in the following reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2; 50 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT; 20% glycerol. Measurement of the background noise is carried out with the buffer without addition of the enzyme. The products are tested at decreasing concentrations starting from 40 uM. The reaction is initiated by the addition of an OMFP solution at 500 uM final (prepared extemporaneously from a 12.5 mM stock solution in 100% DMSO (Sigma #M2629)) . After 4 hours at 30°C in a disposable 384-well plate, the fluorescence measured at OD 475 nm is read using a Victor" plate reader (EGG-Wallac). Determination of the 50% inhibitory concentration of the enzymatic reaction is calculated from three independent experiments. Only the values included in the linear part of the sigmoid are retained for linear regression analysis.<br>
ii) Measurement of the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the CD45 enzyme:<br>
Measurement of the tyrosine phosphatase activity of CD45 is based on the dephosphorylution of the peptide pp60c"src by CD45. Only the cytoplasmic domain of purified human CD45 enzyme (amino acids 584 to 1281, molecular weight = 95 kDa) expressed in a yeast expression system is used for the measurement. The substrate is a synthetic peptide based on the sequence of the negative regulatory domain of pp60c"src. The phosphate released is measured by a malachite green type reagent.<br>
The reaction is carried out in 384-well plate format with a final volume of 20 ul. The substrate pp6(rsil! (P-301, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) is diluted to a concentration of 925 uM in the following reaction buffer: 50 mM Hepes pH 7.2; 1 mM<br>
EDTA; 1 rnM of dithiothreitol (DTT); 0.05% NP-40 surfactant. The final substrate concentration is 185 uM. The candidate products are tested in a range of decreasing concentrations starting from 160 uM. The reaction is initiated by adding CD45 (SE-135, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) at 15 U/ul (1 U = 1 pmol/rmn) diluted in reaction buffer. The final enzyme concentration is 1.75 U/ul. After incubating for 1 hour at 30°C, BIOMOL Green Reagent (AK-111, BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) is added in a volume of 50 ul /' well. After 20 to 30 minutes during which the colour develops, absorbance at 620 nm is read using a Victor" plate reader (EGG-Wallac). Determination of the 50% inhibitory concentration of the enzyme reaction is calculated from three independent experiments.<br>
iii) Characterization of the antiproliferative activity:<br>
By way of example, the effect of a treatment on two human cell lines Mia-Paca2 and DU145 by the compounds of the examples described previously will be studied. The cell lines DIJ145 (human prostate cancer cells) and Mia-PaCa2 (human pancreas cancer cells) were acquired from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, Maryland, USA). The cells placed in 80 ul of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (Gibco-Brl, Cergy-Pontoise, France) completed with 10% foetal calf serum inactivated by heating (Gibco-Brl, Cergy-Pontoise, France), 50,000 units/1 of penicillin and 50 mg/1 of streptomycin (Gibco-Brl, 10378-057, Cergy-Pontoise, France), and 2 mM of glutamine (Gibco-Brl, Cergy-Pontoise, France) were seeded on a 96-well plate on day 0. The cells were treated on day 1 for 96 hours with increasing concentrations of each of the compounds to be tested up to 10 uM. At the end of this period, quantification of cell proliferation is evaluated by a colorimetric test based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST1 by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells leading to the formation of formazan (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France). These tests are carried out in duplicate with 8 determinations per concentration tested. For each compound to be tested, the values included in the linear part of the sigmoid were retained for a linear regression analysis and used to estimate the inhibitory concentration \Cso- The products are solubilized in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) at 10" M and used in culture with 0.1 % DMSO final.<br>
