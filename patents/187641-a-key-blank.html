1 2 JUL 2000<br>
DUPLICATE<br><br>
Will now be'described using identical reference indications.<br>
Both the key blank 22 and the key 24 comprise a generally elongate shaft portion 26, preferably, but not necessarily including first and second opposite planar surfaces 28 and 30, at least one of which constitutes a key combination surface 30 which is arranged to have formed thereon a plurality of key cuts 32, which define a lock combination in a conventional manner. When the key blank 22 and the key 24 define reversible keys, both of planar surfaces 28 and 30 constitute key combination surfaces.<br>
Preferably, each key combination surface 30 also defines elongate keyway guides 34, which fit in configuration to protrusions defined in the interior of the keyway in the corresponding lock, which will described hereinbelow. Some or all of key cuts 32 may be formed over guides 34.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a movable pin element 40 is retained in shaft portion 26 for motion, preferably in a single direction only, perpendicular to, i.e. in and out of the key combination surface 30. In reversible key blanks, as shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, a pair of oppositely directed movable pin elements 40 are retained in shaft portion 26, each for operative association with a key combination surface.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the pair of oppositely-directed movable pin elements may have different configurations. In such a case, depending on the orientation of the key it is operative to operate two different and mutually exclusive master key systems, each of which is operated by a different pin element configuration.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 3A - 3D which are taken along the lines III - III in Fig. 2B and illustrate four different examples of movable pin mountings and configurations.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3A, the shaft 26 is formed with a two step bore 42 for each pin element 41 and the pin element 41 is preferably integrally formed with a plug pin engaging  portion  44  having  a  facing  end  46  which  can be<br><br><br>
selectably configured to provide various combinations, preferably a socket 48 of a desired depth; a broadened intermediate portion 50  and a narrowed pusher pin engagement portion 52. A retaining ring   54   preferably  retains  the  pin  element  40   against disengagement  from  the shaft portion 26 in one  direction  and engagement of intermediate portion 50 with a shoulder 56  retains the pin element 41 against disengagement from shaft portion 26 in the other direction.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3B the same pin element 41 as in the embodiment of Pig. 3A may be employed. Here, however, a single shoulder bore 60 is provided, having a peripheral recess 62, which accommodates a narrow peripheral protrusion 64 of a sealing ring 66.<br>
In  the embodiment of Fig. 3C, a different type of pin element 70 is shown and is preferably integrally formed with a plug pin engaging portion 74 having a facing end 76 which can be selectably configured to provide various combinations, preferably a  socket  78  of a desired depth and a broadened portion 80 defining a pusher pin engagement surface 82. A retaining ring 84 is partially seated in a peripheral key cut 86 formed in  portion 74  adjacent  end 76 and preferably retains the  pin element  70 against disengagement from the shaft portion 87 in one direction and engagement of a shoulder between portions 74 and 80  of pin element 70 with a corresponding shoulder 88 in a bore retains the pin element 70 against disengagement from' shaft portion 87 in the other direction. Boro 9 0 also defines a broadened portion which accommodates retaining ring 84.<br>
In the embodiment, of Fig. 3D, yet another type of pin element 100 is shown and is preferably integrally formed with a plug pin engaging portion '101 having a facing end 102 which can be selectably configured to provide various combinations, preferably a socket 104 of a desired depth, and a broadened portion 106 defining a pusher pin engagement surface 108. No retaining ring is required inasmuch as the top of a bore 110 is swaged as indicated at reference numeral 112 to retain the pin element  100 against disengagement from the shaft portion 114  in<br><br><br>
one direction. Engagement of a shoulder between portions 101 and 106 of pin element 100 with a corresponding shoulder 116 in bore 110 retains the pin element 100 against disengagement from shaft portion 114 in the other direction.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 4, 5 and 6, which illustrate a lock cylinder in operative engagement with a key constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. It is to be appreciated that although the key illustrated at reference numeral 120 in Fig. 4 is the- embodiment shown in Fig. 3A, any suitable embodiment of key may be employed. The lock cylinder of Figs. 4, 5 and 6 comprises a housing 122 and a plug 124 which is arranged for rotation relative thereto and defining a keyway 126.<br>
A first plurality of chambers 128 are formed in the housing 122 and a- second plurality of chambers 130 are formed in the plug on one side of the keyway and are arranged such that each one of the first plurality of chambers 128 extends coaxially with a corresponding one of the second plurality of chambers 130, when the plug is in a first rotational orientation relative to the housing, as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
A plurality of first pin assemblies 132, which are preferably telescopic pin assemblies having a plurality of concentric pin portions as shown including a spring, are preferably disposed in the first plurality of chambers 128 and are retained therein by plugs 134. A plurality of second pin assemblies 136, which are preferably telescopic pin assemblies having a plurality of concentric pin portions as shown, are disposed in the second plurality of chambers 130. A shear line 138 is defined between the facing surfaces of the respective pluralities of first and second pin assemblies 132 and 136, when the proper key is located in its proper location in the keyway 126 in engagement with the second pin assemblies.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a third pin assembly 140 is disposed in a suitable single shoulder bore 142 in the plug 124 on a side of the keyway 126 opposite to that of the second pin assemblies  130<br><br><br>
and is operative to urge a movable pin element 150 outwardly from the key combination surface 152 of the key 120 into operative engagement with one of the second pin assemblies 130. Alternatively, the movable pin element 150 may operate against an additional pin assembly which is not normally found in conventional cylinders.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the movable pin element 150 may be identical to pin element 41 in the embodiment of Pig. 3A. The third pin assembly 140 preferably includes a pusher pin 154 having a rounded forward surface 156 and a broadened end portion 158, which is retained against disengagement from plug 124 by a retaining ring 160. A spring 162, which is stronger than the spring of pin assembly 132, urges pusher pin 154 forwardly into displacing engagement with portion 52 of pin element 150, thus urging pin element 41 into operative engagement with one of the second pin assemblies 130, as shown.<br>
Key guide protrusions 164 are illustrated in Figs.  5 and 6.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates pin 41 having a socket 48 formed at surface 46 thereof. Figs. 7A and 7B illustrate other possible configurations of the forward surface 46 of pin 41, which enable various lock combinations to be realized thereby. In Fig. 7A, the forward surface is flat, as indicated by reference numeral 170. In Fig. 7B, the forward surface is a combination recess and central protrusion. It is appreciated that any other suitable surface configuration may be provided.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 8A and 8B which illus¬trate an alternative embodiment of the key blank and key of Figs. 2A and 2B wherein the movable pins 180 are located beyond the normal key cuts 182 and keyway engaging guides 184. In such a case, an additional plug pin and housing pin (not shown) must be provided for being operated by the movable pin.<br>
It is a particular feature of the present invention that the configuration of the plug pin engagement surface of the movable pin may be selectably configured either as part of the manufacture  of the key blank, or thereafter, when the  key  cuts<br><br><br>
are being made. In the latter case, the same machinery used for cutting  the remaining key cuts can be employed  for configuring the plug pin engagement surface of the movable pin element.  This is made possible by impeding rotation of the movable pin, as is illustrated in Figs. 9 - 13C.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 9 - 13C which illustrate the  construction and mounting of a  non-rotatable movable pin element in a key blank. As seen in Figs. 9 and 10, a movable pin element 200 may be generally identical to pin element'41 of Fig. 3A with  the  additional  provision  of  a  radially  extending protrusion  202 which seats in a corresponding recess 204  in a bore 206 formed in the key blank shaft 208. The movable plug may be retained,  similarly to the embodiment of Fig.  3A,  by a retaining ring  210 in press-fit engagement with a portion of 'bore 206.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, as seen in Figs. 11 and 12, a movable pin element 220 may be generally identical to pin element 41 of Fig. 3A with the additional provision of one or more radially extending recesses 222. The movable plug is retained against rotation by a retaining ring 230, which is formed with protrusions 224 which corresponding to and seat in recesses 222, which is held in non-rotatable press-fit engagement with a portion of a bore 232 in a key blank shaft 234.<br>
Figs. 13A, 13B and 13C illustrate three additional illustrative examples of non-rotating movable pin elements, indicated by reference numerals 240, 242 and 244 which may be retained in a corresponding (suitably shaped bore 250, 252 and 254 in corresponding key blank, (shaft portions 260, 262 and 264. The pin elements of Figs. 13A - 13C are typically retained against disengagement by swaging of the respective bores.<br>
It is to be appreciated that any suitable type of non-rotating movable pin elements may be employed. Their configuration and mounting is not limited by the examples provided herein.<br>
Reference  is  now made to Figs. 14A  and  14B,  which<br><br><br>
illustrate 'a Key blank constructed and operative in"' accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and employing non-rotating movable pins 270 before and after grooving by using a conventional key cutting machine. It is seen that key cuts 272 are formed in the plug pin engaging surfaces of the movable pins 270.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 15A and 15B which illus¬trate a key of the type described above and also having formed therein a retractable cover sleeve 280 for providing- protection of the key cuts and particularly the movable pin elements 282 against ingress of spurious materials or damage which could impede their proper operation.<br>
In the embodiment of Figs. 15A and 15B a compression spring 284 is operative to urge sleeve 280 forward away from a molded key head 286 and over shaft portion 288. The sleeve 280 is retracted into a recess 290 formed into the key head 286 when the key is inserted into a keyway by engagement with the front surface of the plug. It is to be appreciated that normally key blanks are to be manufactured with the sleeve 280 and spring 284 prior In  of Mm Jcny and n the by blnnkn  in this way arc also within tho scopo of tho present invention.<br>
