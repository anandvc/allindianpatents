				<td>8-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a power transmission having four planetary gear<br>
sets that are controlled by five torque-transmitting devices to provide eight forward speed<br>
ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, multi-<br>
speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission increases<br>
the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate through its torque<br>
range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are available in the<br>
transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is repeated. Early<br>
automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range<br>
of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed<br>
and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption point<br>
during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft<br>
transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]	With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These<br>
transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The<br>
increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves<br>
the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially<br>
imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br>
[0004]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy. While<br>
many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios, passenger<br><br>
cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions and relatively<br>
few five- or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these transmissions.<br>
[0005]	Seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions provide further improvements in<br>
acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However, like the six-speed<br>
transmissions discussed above, the development of seven-, eight- and nine-speed transmissions<br>
has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved transmission<br>
having four planetary gear sets controlled to provide eight forward speed ratios and one<br>
reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0007]	The transmission family of the present invention has four planetary gear sets,<br>
each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may comprise a sun<br>
gear, a ring gear, or a planet carrier assembly member, in any order.<br>
[0008]	In referring to the first, second, third and fourth gear sets in this description and<br>
in the claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "fourth" in any order in the drawing (i.e.,<br>
left to right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or third members of each gear<br>
set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the drawing (i.e., top to bottom, bottom<br>
to top, etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0009]	Each carrier member can be either a single-pinion carrier member (simple) or a<br>
double-pinion carrier member (compound). Embodiments with long pinions are also possible.<br>
[0010]	A first interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of said<br>
second planetary gear set with said third member of said third planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	A second interconnecting member continuously connects the first member of<br>
said third planetary gear set with said first member of said fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]	A third interconnecting member continuously connects the third member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the second member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br><br>
[0013]	The input member is continuously connected with the first member of the<br>
second planetary gear set. The output member is continuously interconnected with the second<br>
member of the third planetary gear set. The first member of the first planetary gear set and the<br>
second member of the second planetary gear set are continuously connected with a stationary<br>
member (transmission housing/casing).<br>
[0014]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as a brake, selectively connects the third<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with a stationary member (transmission housing/casing).<br>
[0015]	A second torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the first planetary gear set with the first member of the second planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0016]	A third torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
first member of the second planetary gear set with the third member of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0017]	A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the<br>
second member of the third planetary gear set with the third member of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0018]	A fifth torque-transmitting device, such as a clutch, selectively connects the first<br>
member of the third planetary gear set with the third member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0019]	The five torque-transmitting devices are selectively engageable in combinations<br>
of two to yield eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio.<br>
[0020]	A variety of speed ratios and ratio spreads can be realized by suitably selecting<br>
the tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets.<br>
[0021]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out<br>
the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

characteristics of the powertrain shown in Figure la; and<br>
[0024]	FIGURE 1c is a schematic representation of the powertrain of Figure la<br>
depicted in lever diagram form.<br>

54, and a planet carrier assembly member 56. The planet carrier assembly member 56<br>
includes a plurality of pinion gears 57 mounted on a carrier member 59 and disposed in<br>
meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 52 and the ring gear member 54.<br>
[0031]	The planetary gear arrangement also includes five torque-transmitting devices<br>
80, 82, 84, 85 and 86. The torque-transmitting device 80 is a stationary-type torque-<br>
transmitting device, commonly termed brake or reaction clutch. The torque-transmitting<br>
devices 82, 84, 85 and 86 are rotating-type torque-transmitting devices, commonly termed<br>
clutches.<br>
[0032]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 32 of<br>
the planetary gear set 30. The output member 19 is continuously connected with the planet<br>
carrier assembly member 46 of the planetary gear set 40. The sun gear member 22 of the<br>
planetary gear set 20 and the planet carrier assembly member 36 of the planetary gear set 30<br>
are continuously connected with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0033]	A first interconnecting member 70 continuously connects the ring gear member<br>
34 of the planetary gear set 30 with the ring gear member 44 of the planetary gear set 40. A<br>
second interconnecting member 72 continuously connects the sun gear member 42 of the<br>

assembly member 26 of the planetary gear set 20 with the sun gear member 32 of the planetary<br>
gear set 30. A third torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 84, selectively connects the sun<br>

[0035]	As shown in Figure 1b, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein, the<br>
torque-transmitting devices are selectively engaged in combinations of two to provide eight<br>
forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio, all with single transition shifts.<br>
[0036]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting devices<br>
is shown in the truth table of Figure lb. The chart of Figure lb describes the ratio steps that<br>
are attained in the above described transmission. For example, the step ratio between the first<br>
and second forward speed ratios is 1.49, while the step ratio between the reverse speed ratio<br>
and first forward ratio is -0.76.<br>
[0037]	Referring to Figure 1c, the embodiment of powertrain 10 depicted in Fig. la is<br>
illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a schematic representation of the<br>
components of a mechanical device such as an automatic transmission. Each individual lever<br>
represents a planetary gearset, wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary<br>
gear are each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear member, one for the planet gear carrier member, and one for the ring gear<br>
member. The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ring-<br>
to-sun ratio of each respective gearset. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear<br>
ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br><br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various planetary gear sets<br>
are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and<br>
brakes are presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be found<br>
in SAE Paper 810102, authored by Benford, Howard and Leising, Maurice, "The Lever<br>
Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis", 1981, which is hereby fully incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0038]	The powertrain 10 includes an input member 17 continuously connected with the<br>
engine 12, an output member 19 continuously connected with the final drive mechanism 16, a<br>
first planetary gear set 20A having three nodes: a first node 22A, a second node 26A and a<br>
third node 24A; a second planetary gear set 30A having three nodes: a first node 32A, a<br>
second node 36A and a third node 34A; a third planetary gear set 40A having three nodes: a<br>
first node 42A, a second node 46A and a third node 44A; and a fourth planetary gear set 50A<br>
having three nodes: a first node 52A, a second node 56A and a third node 54A.<br>
[0039]	The input member 17 is continuously connected with the node 32A. The output<br>
member 19 is continuously connected with the node 46A. The nodes 22A and 36A are<br>
continuously connected with the transmission housing 60.<br>
[0040]	The node 34A is continuously connected with node 44A via interconnecting<br>
member 70. The node 42A is continuously connected with node 52A via interconnecting<br>
member 72. The node 24A is continuously connected with node 56A via interconnecting<br>
member 74.<br>
[0041]	A first torque-transmitting device, such as brake 80, selectively connects the<br>
nodes 24A and 56A via interconnecting member 74 with the transmission housing 60. A<br>
second torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 82, selectively connects the node 26A with<br>
the node 32A. A third torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 84, selectively connects the<br>
node 32A with the node 54A. A fourth torque-transmitting device, such as clutch 85,<br>
selectively connects the node 46A with the node 54A. A fifth torque-transmitting device, such<br><br>
as clutch 86, selectively connects the nodes 42A and 52A via interconnecting member 72 with<br>
the node 54A.<br>
[0042]	To establish ratios, two torque-transmitting devices are engaged for each gear<br>
state. The engaged torque-transmitting devices are represented by an "X" in each respective<br>
row of Fig. lb. For example, to establish reverse gear, the brake 80 and clutch 84 are<br>
engaged. The brake 80 engages the nodes 24A and 56A with the transmission housing 60.<br>
The clutch 84 engages the node 32A with the node 54A. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are<br>
achieved through different combinations of clutch engagement as per Figure lb.<br>
[0043]	The powertrain 10 may share components with a hybrid vehicle, and such a<br>
combination may be operable in a "charge-depleting mode". For purposes of the present<br>
invention, a "charge-depleting mode" is a mode wherein the vehicle is powered primarily by an<br>
electric motor/generator such that a battery is depleted or nearly depleted when the vehicle<br>
reaches its destination. In other words, during the charge-depleting mode, the engine 12 is only<br>
operated to the extent necessary to ensure that the battery is not depleted before the destination is<br>
reached. A conventional hybrid vehicle operates in a "charge-sustaining mode", wherein if the<br>
battery charge level drops below a predetermined level (e.g., 25%) the engine is automatically<br>
run to recharge the battery. Therefore, by operating in a charge-depleting mode, the hybrid<br>
vehicle can conserve some or all of the fuel that would otherwise be expended to maintain the<br>
25% battery charge level in a conventional hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that a hybrid<br>
vehicle powertrain is preferably only operated in the charge-depleting mode if the battery can be<br>
recharged after the destination is reached by plugging it into an energy source.<br>
[0044]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in<br>
detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>

Dated this 28th day of MAY 2008<br><br>
The transmission has a plurality of members that can be utilized in powertrains to provide eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed ratio. The transmission includes four planetary gear sets, five torque-transmitting devices, two grounded members and three fixed nterconnections. The powertrain includes an engine and torque converter that is continuously connected to one of the planetary gear members and an output member that is continuously connected with another one of the planetary gear members. The five torque-transmitting devices provide interconnections between various gear members, and the transmission housing, and are<br>
operated in combinations of two to establish eight forward speed ratios and one reverse speed<br>
ratio.<br></td>
