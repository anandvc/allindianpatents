JAPAN A. C. R. CO., LTD. of 25 -7, NOBORITO-CHO, KOSHIGAYA-SHI SAITAMA - 343 0846 JAPAN, JAPANESE Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
ELECTROMAGNETIC DEVICE AND CIRCUIT FOR DRIVING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to an electromagnetic device suitable for a microminia¬<br>
ture oscillator or switching device and to a circuit for driving the electromagnetic de¬<br>
vice.<br>
5	BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, portable telephones have been surprisingly popularized, and<br>
those designed to inform users of the ringing of telephones through oscillations have<br>
been chiefly used   for the extension of user strata and the convenience of users.<br>
Such a portable telephone is constructed so that an eccentric weight is attached to the<br>
10	main shaft of a motor housed in a telephone body and is rotated by the rotation of the<br>
motor driven simultaneously with the reception of a call signal, and a difference in position between the main shaft and the eccentric weight is converted into an oscilla¬tion to transmit this oscillation to a user.<br>
For the portable telephone of this type, a coreless-type motor is usually used<br>
15	(refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Preliminary Publication No. Hei 4-275046).<br>
This motor, however, not only is complicated in structure and high in cost, but also<br>
causes a forced rotation because it is used in a state where the eccentric weight is at¬<br>
tached to a motor shaft. Hence, one-sided wear of bearings and the deformation of<br>
a rotary shaft are produced, raising the problem of impairing durability. Further-<br>
20	more, since a space sufficient to turn the weight must be provided, a relatively large<br>
space is required for an oscillation generator.    This makes it difficult to achieve<br><br><br>
compactness of the device.   In addition, there is a disadvantage even when the ef¬fective utilization of electric power is considered.<br>
A system constructed so that a pulse motor is incorporated and an oscillation<br>
pattern can be selected to securely call a mate intended when necessary, is proposed<br>
5	(refer to, for example, Japanese Patent Preliminary Publication No. Hei 5-191334).<br>
However, this system has the same problem as in the above case.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an electromagnetic<br>
device which not only can be manufactured in small size and at a low cost and guar¬<br>
antees high reliability of operation and durability, but also is capable of effectively<br>
10	utilizing electric power and is suitable for an oscillator, and a circuit for driving the<br>
electromagnetic device.<br>

the excitation coil, the other side thereof is spaced away from the one side.    The<br>
other side of the movable iron piece is held to be displaceable against its resilient<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
20	In accordance with the embodiments shown in the drawings, various aspects of<br>
the present invention will be described below. In Figs. 1 to 6, showing the first em¬<br>
bodiment of the electromagnetic device according to the present invention, reference<br>
numeral 1 denotes a coil bobbin having a hollow section la whose both ends are<br>
opened, an excitation-coil mounting section lb, and a through-hole section lc; 2 de-<br>
25	notes a movable iron piece in which a strip piece constructed of a soft magnetic ma-<br>
terial which is not subjected to magnetic annealing is bent into a U-shape so that one<br><br><br>
side 2a is inserted in the hollow section la of the coil bobbin 1 and a remaining side<br>
2b is inserted in the through-hole section lc of the coil bobbin 1 to have a resilient<br>
characteristic that both sides are spaced away from each other; 3 and 4 denote iron<br>
icores inserted in and fixed to the hollow section la of the coil bobbin 1, with the<br>
5	movable iron piece held between them, each constructed so that one end is bent to<br>
rise toward the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 and a top surface, as shown in Fig. 4, is configured to increase a flux linkage by bending the top of each of rising sections 3a and 4a; 5 denotes an excitation coil including an electric wire wound around the excitation-coil mounting section lb of the coil bobbin 1; and 6 de-<br>
10	notes connecting terminals screwed into the coil bobbin 1 in order to connect the ex-<br>
citation coil 5 to a power supply. In this case, the top of the one side 2a of the mov¬able iron piece 2, as clearly shown in Fig. 5, is engaged with the base of the rising section 3a of the iron core 3 so that the movable iron piece 2 and the iron core 3 are not separated in the proximity of the rising section 3a.    Furthermore, in a normal<br>
15	state, the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 is held by the upper wall of<br>
the through-hole section lc of the coil bobbin 1 against its resilient force so that a preset distance between the remaining side 2b and the common top surface of the rising sections 3a and 4a of the iron cores 3 and 4 is maintained. In the case where the electromagnetic device is used as an oscillator that informs a user of the reception<br>
20	of the call signal of a portable telephone, a projection 2b' is configured at the top of<br>
the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2.<br>
The block diagram of Fig. 7 shows the basic configuration of the driving cir¬cuit used in the electromagnetic device. In this diagram, reference numeral 7 repre¬sents a normally open switch closed for a preset time when a call signal S is received,<br>
25	8 represents a power cell, and 9 represents a current-pulse circuit configured so that<br>
an oscillation mode can be selected by an arithmetical unit 10, that is, so that at least<br><br><br>
one of a conduction time t,, a conduction period t2, and a conduction duration T (see<br>
Fig. 8) of a pulse current supplied to the excitation coil 5 of the electromagnetic de¬<br>
vice can be controlled. Also, where the electromagnetic device is used as the os¬<br>
cillator that informs a user of the call of a portable telephone, a CPU incorporated in<br>
5	the portable telephone can be used as the arithmetical unit 10.<br>
Since the first embodiment is constructed as mentioned above, the oscillator informing a user of the call of the portable telephone is cited as an example, and its function will be described below. When the switch 7 is closed by the reception of the call signal S, a pulse current having the conduction time t„ the conduction period<br>
10	t2, and the conduction duration T which are set by the arithmetical unit 10 is supplied<br>
from the current-pulse circuit 9 to the excitation coil 5. In this way, when the exci¬tation coil 5 is conducted, a magnetic flux is generated in a magnetic circuit con¬structed with the movable iron piece 2 and the iron cores 3 and 4. Moreover, an at¬tractive force is produced in a direction that a magnetic space between the remaining<br>
is	side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 and the common top surface of the rising sections<br>
3a and 4a of the iron cores 3 and 4 is reduced, that is, in a direction opposite to the resilient force of the remaining side 2b. Consequently, the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 is displaced as indicated by a chain line in Fig. 4. Thus, when the conduction of the excitation coil 5 is interrupted, the magnetic flux of the mag-<br>
20	netic circuit is dissipated and the magnetic circuit is demagnetized.    For this, the re-<br>
silient force of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 overcomes the at¬tractive force of the magnetic circuit, and the remaining side 2b is displaced until it abuts on the upper wall of the through-hole section lc of the coil bobbin 1 (until it reaches a position indicated by a solid line in Fig. 4).   At this time, the projection<br>
25	2b' strikes the wall, not shown, of the portable telephone.    By repeating this con-<br>
duction and'interruption relative to the excitation coil 5, namely the displacement of<br><br><br>
the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2, oscillation is generated to inform a user of the reception of the call signal.<br>
In this case, an oscillation frequency is governed by the conduction time, con¬<br>
duction period, and conduction duration of the pulse current supplied to the excitati-<br>
5	on coil 5; the inductance of the excitation coil 5; the time constant of the driving cir-<br>
cuit; the permeance of the magnetic space; and the resilient force, namely the spring constant, of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2. In practical use, therefore, the oscillation can be properly modulated by varying at least one of the conduction time, period, and duration of the pulse current through the arithmetical<br>
io	unit 10.    The use of this function of modulation provides an application such that<br>
the oscillation informs the same mate of a normal call in distinction from an emer¬gency call, thus further improving a call function. The first embodiment is con¬structed so that a plurality of iron cores are used and the attractive section of each of the iron cores can be adequately enlarged by bending the end of the iron core itself to<br>
15	increase the flux linkage and improve an attractive efficiency.   The first embodi-<br>
ment is also constructed so that a proper spring constant (resilient force) is imparted to the remaining side 2b of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 which can be rela¬tively extended, and the movement of the remaining side 2b can be suppressed by a part (the upper wall of the through-hole section lc) of the coil bobbin 1.   Hence, an<br>
20	oscillator can be provided which not only is simple in assembly and small in size, but<br>
also is strong for its size and is high in reliability of operation and durability. Moreover, there is the advantage of being usable with a simple driving circuit.<br>
Figs. 9 to 11 show modification examples of the first embodiment which are different from one another.   The modification example shown in Fig. 9 has the fea-<br>
25	ture that the iron core 4 is eliminated and the top of the rising section 3a, that is, the<br>
attractive section, is designed so that the end of the iron core 3 can be bent double to<br><br><br>
enlarge the area of the attractive section and increase the flux linkage. The modifi¬<br>
cation example of Fig. 10 has the feature that the one side 2a of the U-shaped mov¬<br>
able iron piece 2 is also used as the iron core and the attractive section is configured<br>
by bending the top of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 toward the<br>
5	one side 2a so that the structure is simplified.    The modification example of Fig. 11<br>
is characterized in that the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 is also used as the iron core and the attractive section is constructed with an iron piece 11 fastened to the top of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2, for example, by a caulking technique, and configured to increase the flux linkage.    In any of the-<br>
10	se modification examples, its structure and fundamental function and effect are the<br>
same as in the first embodiment, except for the above description, and thus their de¬tailed explanation is omitted. In particular, each of the modification examples of Figs. 10 and 11 has the advantage that further compactness can be achieved. The modification example of Fig. 10, instead of bending the top of the remaining side 2b<br>
is	of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2, may be designed to bend upward the top of<br>
the one side 2a. In the modification example of Fig. 11, the iron piece 11 may be fastened to the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2.<br>
Fig. 12 shows the second embodiment of the present invention.    In this figure, like numerals are used for like members and parts with respect to the first embodi-<br>
zo	ment, and their detailed description is omitted.    The second embodiment has the<br>
same structure as the first embodiment with the exception that the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 is magnetically annealed and a repulsive force of the remaining side 2b relative to the one side 2a is exerted by a U-shaped leaf spring 12 in which one side 12a is inserted in and fixed to the hollow section la of the coil bobbin 1, together<br>
25	with the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 and the iron cores 3 and 4,<br>
while a remaining side 12b is provided along the movable iron piece 2 so as to have a<br><br><br>
resilient characteristic that the remaining side 12b is spaced away from the one side<br>
12a, and a top 12b' is engaged with the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece<br>
2 by a proper known technique.   The function and effect of the second embodiment<br>
are the same as in the first embodiment, and thus their explanation is omitted.<br>
5	Figs. 13 to 15 show modification examples of the second embodiment which<br>
are different from one another. The modification example shown in Fig. 13 has the feature that the iron core 4 is eliminated and the top of the rising section 3a, that is, the attractive section, is designed so that the end of the iron core 3 is bent double to enlarge the area of the attractive section and increase the flux linkage.   The modifi-<br>
10	cation example of Fig. 14 has the feature that the one side 2a of the U-shaped mov-<br>
able iron piece 2 is also used as the iron core and the attractive section is configured so that the top of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 is bent in two steps toward the one side 2a to thereby increase the flux linkage, with the result that the structure is further simplified.    The modification example of Fig. 15 is charac-<br>
15	terized in that the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 is also used as<br>
the iron core and the attractive section is constructed with the iron piece 11 fastened to both the top of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 and the top of the remaining side 12b of the U-shaped leaf spring 12, for example, by a caulking tech¬nique.   In any of these modification examples, its structure and fundamental func-<br>
20	tion and effect are the same as in the second embodiment, except for the above de-<br>
scription, and thus their detailed explanation is omitted. The modification example of Fig. 14, instead of bending the top of the remaining side 2b of the U-shaped mov¬able iron piece 2 in two steps, may be designed to bend upward the top of the one side 2a in the same manner.   In the modification example of Fig. 15, the iron piece<br>
25	11 may be fastened to both the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 and<br>
the one side' 12a of the U-shaped leaf spring 12.<br><br><br>
Fig. 16 shows the third embodiment of the present invention.   In this figure,<br>
like numerals are used for like members and parts with respect to the above embodi¬<br>
ments and their detailed explanation is omitted.   The third embodiment has the<br>
same structure as in the above embodiments with the exception that the U-shaped<br>
5	movable iron piece 2 is magnetically annealed and a repulsive force of the remaining<br>
side 2b relative to the one side 2a is exerted by a resilient member, for example, a coil spring 13 loosely wound around the rising sections 3a and 4a of the iron cores 3 and 4, interposed between the sides 2a and 2b. Since the third embodiment has the same function and effect as in the first embodiment with the exception of the feature<br>
10	that the assembly of the device is relatively simple, their explanation is omitted.<br>
Figs. 17 to 20 show modification examples of the third embodiment which are different from one another. The modification example shown in Fig. 17 has the feature that the iron core 4 is eliminated and the top of the rising section 3a, that is, the attractive section, is designed so that the end of the iron core 3 is bent double to<br>
15	enlarge the area of the attractive section and increase the flux linkage.   The modifi-<br>
cation example of Fig. 18 has the feature that the one side 2a of the U-shaped mov¬able iron piece 2 is also used as the iron core, the attractive section is configured by bending the top of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2 in two steps to¬ward the one side 2a to enable the flux linkage to be increased, and the coil spring 13<br>
20	is wound around this bending section so that the structure is further simplified.   The<br>
modification example of Fig. 19 is characterized in that the one side 2a of the U-shaped iron piece 2 is also used as the iron core and the attractive section is con¬structed with the iron piece 11 fastened to the top of the remaining side 2b of the movable iron piece 2, for example, by a caulking technique, so that the coil spring 13<br>
25	is wound around the iron piece 11.    The modification example of Fig. 20 is the same<br>
as that of Fig. 19 with the exception that another iron core 11 is also fastened to the<br><br><br>
top of the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2, for example, by a<br>
caulking technique, so as to be opposite to the iron core 11 of Fig. 19, and the coil<br>
spring 13 is wound around both the iron cores 11. In any of these modification ex¬<br>
amples, its structure and fundamental function and effect are the same as in the third<br>
5	embodiment, except for the above description, and thus their detailed explanation is<br>
omitted. Also, since the coil spring 13 is cited as an example of the resilient mem¬ber, the present invention is not limited to this. The modification example of Fig. 18, instead of bending the top of the remaining side 2b of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 in two steps, may be designed to bend upward the top of the one side 2a in<br>
10	the same manner.   In the modification example of Fig. 19, the iron core 11 may also<br>
be designed so that it is fastened to the one side 2a of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2.<br>
Figs. 21 to 24 show the fourth embodiment of the present invention.    In these figures, like numerals are used for like members and parts with respect to the above<br>
is	embodiments and their detailed explanation is omitted.   The fourth embodiment is<br>
the same as any of the above embodiments with the exception that a highly flexible, thin U-shaped leaf spring 14 is provided which has one side 14a and a remaining side 14b along the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 constructed as in the first embodiment, except for the projection 2b', so that in particular, the base of the remaining side 14b<br>
20	is fastened to the remaining side 2b of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2, for exam-<br>
ple, by a caulking technique, and its top extends beyond the top of the remaining side 2b to attach a weight 15 thereto. The fourth embodiment is very effective in the case where it is utilized as the oscillator informing a user of the call of the portable telephone because when the remaining side 2b of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2<br>
25	is moved by attraction and repulsion, the force of inertia caused by the weight 15 is<br>
imparted thereto and the amount of displacement, especially on repulsion, of the<br><br><br>
front end of the remaining side 14b of the U-shaped leaf spring 14 is increased.<br>
As will be evident from the above description, electromagnetic pure iron steel<br>
plates or permalloy plates are used as materials of the U-shaped movable iron piece 2<br>
and the iron cores 3 and 4.    The experiment of the present applicant in the case<br>
5	where the electromagnetic device is used as the oscillator for the call of the portable<br>
telephone shows that when power consumption, oscillating excitation force, satura¬<br>
tion flux density, and resilient force are taken into consideration, it is optimum that<br>
the magnetic path length governed by the U-shaped movable iron piece 2 and the<br>
iron cores 3 and 4 is in the range of 24-36 mm, the cross-sectional area of the mov-<br>
10	able iron piece 2 is 1.2-3.2 mm2, and the cross-sectional area of each of the iron cores<br>
3 and 4 is 2.4-3.6 mm2.<br>
Although the fourth embodiment has been described on the premise that the<br>
electromagnetic device is applied to the oscillator for the call of the portable tele¬<br>
phone, the electromagnetic device is applicable to a reception-informing device in an<br>
is	electromagnetic switching apparatus or other communication apparatuses and to an<br>
electromagnetic driving application device. In particular, even a microminiature<br>
device can be constructed as a strong oscillator and in addition, so that the oscillation<br>
of the oscillation section is not propagated to a device body. Thus, the oscillator it¬<br>
self is held in the ear or on the periphery thereof and can be used like an earphone or<br>
20	a headphone.    Various applications are possible.<br>
