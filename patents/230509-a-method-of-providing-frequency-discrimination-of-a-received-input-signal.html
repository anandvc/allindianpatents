FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field oi the Invmtion<br>
[0001]	The    present    invention   relates    generally   to    communications.<br>
Particularly, rbe present invention relates to frequency discrimination in a v.■&gt;auni«iications environment.<br>
'.inscription of the Related Axt<br>
i i)l)02]	CDMA conanunicatioos systems typically use directional antennas<br>
located in the center of a cell and broadcasting into sector.; of the cell. The antennas IK?, coupled to base stations that transmit control the cells. The cells arc? typically located in mE=;cr metropolitan areas, iilcng highways, and along train tracks to allow uonsuscers to communicate both at home and while traveling.<br>
,'
:;;equency that is loiown to each, there are factors such as multipath errors and I&gt;oppler shift in. "the frequency that introduce errors in 'the frequency that is received. Tor exiiinple, if a mobile is approaching a base station, the Doppler effect increases ;ne signal's .frequency as observed by die base station. If the mobile is moving away from the bass station, the base station observes a signal having a frequency that is less tian the frequency transmitted by the mobile. The amount of frequency shift is a t unction of t:.e $x\eed of the mobile.<br>
[00043	Another source of frequency error is the fact that the two local<br>
collators (one at the base station and one at fee mobile taat are used for generating the "clock" signal) can never be operating at exactly the same frequency. Typically, the mobile uses ,a IQIS expensive local oscillator that can introduce a frequency error of up to 10 KHz; when the carrier frequency is around 2 GHz.<br><br>
[iJ&amp;OS]'	During communication, the base station transmits a pilot channel that<br>
in received by the mobile. The pilot channel, comprised of pilot symbols, contains no n formation. 'Hie mobile utilizes the pilot symbols to generate time, frequency, phase, ai id sign al str;ngi3i references.<br>
[ 1006]	In some systems, the mobile also transrxiits a pilot signal. The mobile's<br>
pilot signal is them similarly used by the receiving: base station to generate time,<br>
frequency, phase, and -signal strength references relative to the mobile.<br>
[0007]	Ii order for a base station to communicate with a mobile on a certain<br>
frequency, bo?:h need to uae a frequency discriminator in a frsquenoy-tracking loop,<br>
[0008]	FIG, 1 illustrates a typical prior art frequtsney-tracking loop (FTL) 100.<br>
'This figure &amp;':sw*&amp; a signal, A/, entering a summer 101. Af represents the frequency cuTor present m an incoming signal D£ successive pilot symbols. The summer 101 ;!;\ibtraci:s from Af an initial estimate &amp;f.<br>
[111)09]	Frequency iliiscrinanator 105 is loiown and operates on the frequency'<br>
li-cror associated with successive pilot symbols.   The value of each pilot symbol is<br>
h erein jepresenuid by variable y*. The period of each symbol y&gt;. is denoted by Ts*<br>
";i)010]	An incoming sequence of pilot symbols are accumulated after input<br>

where nk is the additive noise corrupting the kih symbol and^ is a complex amplitude<br>
mat is a function of, among other things., the current channel attenuation. It is assumed Mat fading i;&gt; :dow enough so that successive symbols have roughly the same complex giinplitude.<br>
{0011]	A time constant (T) is herein defined as the time it takes FTL 100 to<br>
converge to 1/e of an initial frequency error. ApulHn range conventionally defines a maximum initial frequency error for which FTL 100 is able to converge. A design goal is to minimize time constant T, all the white maximizing the pull-in range, tc maintain the standard deviation of the frequency error under steady-state conditions to within desirable levels.<br><br>
£M&gt;12]	A loop filter L(z) 110, senes coupled to tne output or frequency<br>
ciscriniinator 10Sf is; used to adjust the time constant T» pull-in range, and standard deviation of thr, frequency error.<br>
[D013]	A known type of frequency diacrirninator 105 is a cross product<br><:a ym operation of which may be expressed as hff i></:a>

in range- due ro ;he effect of noise. Second, when the initial frequency enor A/ is greater than Vi the theoretical pull-in range, FTL 100 takes a long time to converge to 1/5 of an initial frequency error A/,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

[(R)20]	Conversely,   when   the  cross  product  is   less   than   the  selected<br>

The calculation of and inrcettieuting aid decrementing of the cross product is generated by a frequency d. Eliminator. This- output of the frequency discriminator is used to derive a residual frequency en or '.lot an incoming signal comprised of successive pilot, symbols. Successive symbols signals are fed into the frequency discriminator and the previously derived residual frequency error used to adjust the output of the frequency discriminator ihat then provides a new output to the F1TL<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[1)031]	A frequency discriminator characterised by the following description<br>
provides, a large effective pull-in range and fast convergence in comparison to known ctoss product discriminators.<br>
[0032]	h). accordance with an" embodiment, the frequency includes both a<br>
siioiple cross product discriminator and a dot product discriminator. As used above, i: e cros s prod'ac: .discriminator, denoted as cp, is expressed as:<br><br><br><br>
where a and it) ft;e constants whose values are design parameters based on a desired s) uem.<br>
[01*35]	II;L a first embodiment, a is in the range of 0 to 5.   For a = 0 the<br>
frequency discrinuiuiior collapses to a simple cross product discriminator. This can he<br>
ss:e;n by substituting 0 for a in the above expression for &amp;f™[ [i(&gt;36]	In another embodiment a is chosen to be a power of 2. This is derived<br>
3i' a frequency discriminator hardware-specific implementation where muHpIication<br>
virh a, where a is a power 2, becomes a simple left shift operation.<br>
|,T)037]	In one embodiment, ft its in die range of a real number that is; less than<br>
0, However, oihsc: ranges for ft can be used as well.<br>
[OtfBS]	It should be further appreciated dial the frequency discriminator<br>
operation described hereit maybe implemented by a digitd signal processor (DSP).<br>
Also, trie dot product measurement may be calculated in parallel with the cross<br>
product measurements using hardware. The "if statements can be implemented as<br>
;:iultipiixers which use thd sign bits of the cp and the dp calculation as output<br>
;&gt;;lecto::s.<br>
^)039]	A hardware block diagram of one embodiment of the frequency<br>
;iscrin.inator in illustrated in HG, 2* Those skilled in tie art will recognise that<br>
?lterna:e embodiments may encompass different hardware variations to arrive at the<br>
^ame desired result<br>
[0040*1	'Ihe frequency discriminator of FIG. 2 includes a cross product block<br>
;.01 and a dot product block 202. Both blocks 201 and 202 receive as inputs,<br>
sequential pilot, symbols yk and y^.<br>
10041]	£i the illustrative embodiment, the output cross product generated by<br>
cross product block 201 is a real value (as opposed to a complex value). The real value is expressed as cp = Tea](y*)real(yw) + imag(yjj)imag(y^/).<br><br>
[0)42]	The output dot product block (202) also generates a real vsdue. This<br>
V5lue is- expressed as dp = imag(yit)real(yjw) - real(yjfe)iinag(y*.;).<br>
[<iq4 output cross product is fed to the new input of ihe first></iq4>
malriplexer 235, as shown.   In the present example, when a = 0, a simple cross<br>
product is output, by tiie frequency discriminator 105.<br>
[i|tl44]	Output dot product (dp) is fed to the zero (0) input of a first multiplier<br>
215 where it geta multiplied by a. The output of the first multiplier 215 is input to a<br>
second 'multiplexer 225, The output of the first multiplier 215 is also input to a second<br>
r* ultiplier 220 where the s:gn of the adp signal gets inverted by multiplying the input<br>
uith -1. The oulput of second multiplier 220 is also inpu: to the second multiplexer<br>
i:25. A select input of second multiplexer 225 is received from decision block 2051<br>
[|i«)453	When the output from decision block 205 is true, (*.#., cp 
high is generated and the non-inverted ctdp signal is output from multiplexer 225.<br>
When rot true., Le&gt; cp &gt; 0, the inverted arfp signal is output by multiplexer 225.<br>
i11046]	T.iie second multiplexer 225 output is coupled to summer 230 and<br>
c.ther udp or (-o.jp) is added to output. The output from summer 230 is input to one<br>
f i) input of firs: multiplexer 235.<br>
|?!1047]	Referring to the bottom of FIG. 2, the output of decision block 210<br>
ninputs a lojiii? bigli when the condition dp  holds true. A logic high signal as a<br>
?&gt;lect input i.c the first multiplexer 235, will cause ths first multiplexer 235. This i$ to<br>
select the output of summer 230. When the dot product is 0, the condition is false and<br>
iftt cross product is selected as the output to first multiplexer 235, and decision block<br>
HO selects the 0 input of the first multiplexer 235.<br>
(0048 J	li: should be understood that the above-described signal selection<br>
procests may be implemented in various programming languages. In one embodiment,<br>
the process can be implemented in the "C" programming language, and is. expressed<br><br><br><br>
[O-0491	The exemplary frequency discriminator can be used in any situation<br>
that requires a low-comple;city frequency estimator, such as in the frequency-tracking loop of :?IG. 1. In: one embodiment, this frequency discriminator is used in a FTL in a mobile communication device such as a mobile telephone. In a mobile telephone, the frequency discriminator it used on the downlink direction of the communication. Le. the basts station to mobile link.<br>
[iJ050]	Because  tlie signal-to-noise ratio (SN&amp;)  of a downlink pilot is<br>
Milatively high, &amp; frequency discriminator as described aboA'e is particularly desirable.<br>
[[051]	'I;h«3 above frequency discriminator can also be used on the uplink<br>
direction, le... "h&amp; mobile-to-base station link. In die uplink, the SNR of a pilot is very<br>
l;w&gt; Fcr example, a pilot SNR (   CA  ) might be as low as -38dB. Frequency<br>
/ io<br>
i .^eliminators described above may be used in a low SNR uplink.<br>
1110521	However, compensating tor the low SNR to adjust lower SNE, it might<br>
hs desirable to increase the accumulation length of the pilot symbols (i.e., increase<br>
'i7&gt;. Alternatively* low-pass filtering the cross product and the dot product will also<br>
vork. Using such an embodiment changes the above equations. Factoring in a low<br>
tli&gt;5TR, a frequency discriminator for use in an uplink for example may be expressed aiv<br>
follows.<br><br><br><br>
where |i is constant between 0 and I and ihe cp and dp teuns are outputs of one-tap IIBL filters. For very low pilot SNRs, a p closer to 0 is best. For p = ls the above expression yifclds the same discriminator result as the high SNR frequency cscriitiinator expression described earlier.<br>
