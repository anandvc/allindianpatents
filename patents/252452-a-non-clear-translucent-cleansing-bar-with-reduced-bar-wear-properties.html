				<td>BAR SOAP COMPOSITION WITH REDUCED BAR WEAR PROPERTIES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to cleansing bar compositions which are translucent, pearlized, or opaque; have good structural integrity, exhibit good cleansing properties; and provide effective and mild cleansing, pleasing aesthetics, and a low wear rate. This case is related to U.S. Provisional Application Number 60/514,992, filed October 28, 2003.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Bar soaps are still widely used. With regard to cost and aesthetics, wear rate (also called use up rate) Is an important property. Consumer perceived economy of bar soaps is determined by the amount of mush (also called slough) that occurs as the bar surface hydrates. The mush is considered undesirable by consumers since it is easily removed and washed off of the bar surface, leaving the user with less usable soap. Bar use up rate is another indication of the economy of the bar soap. Use up is determined by the physical abrasion (mechanical action) on the bar and is related to bar hardness and shape.<br>
In addition to the economy of a bar, there is also a desire to maintain good foaming and cleaning abilities. The quality and quantity of lather produced by washing with a bar is associated with the cleansing ability of the bar. Other qualities desired are good rinsability, mildness to the skin, and delivery of fragrance to the user's skin. The combination of an efficient bar soap with effective-cleansing and bar aesthetics has been often attempted.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2003/0166480 describes certain ranges and combination of soap, synthetic surfactant, water, lower monohydric alcohol, humectant, structurant and gellant which can be used to bring about an excellent combination of desirable characteristics of a translucent or transparent bar composition.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,514,919 discloses a clear cleansing bar that does not form gel or mush, does not crack upon drying, and is non-irritating to the eyes. The clear bar composition in this reference contains dibenzylidene sorbitol ("DBS") as the gelling<br><br>
agent This reference does not, however, address non-clear cleansing bars composed of<br>
«,<br>
sodium soaps and is silent to the combination of glycerin and DBS.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,340,492, describes cleansing bars with a rigid interlocking mesh of neutralized carboxylic acids. The bars are cleansing bars with excellent smear properties.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,403,543, describes the suspension of particles in a bar soap. This suspension is achieved by using a gel matrix in which particles are suspended before addition to the soap mixture.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,310,015 describes a translucent/transparent/moisturizing cleansing bar.<br>
It has now been found mat a combination of DBS and glycerin gives an especially good product, especially as it relates to forming a soap bar which is not clear, and exhibits a longer life as compared to a DBS only bar. The richness of the aesthetics of the non-clear bar can also be enhanced by the inclusion of encapsulated fats/oils or emollient esters the form of beads.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the composition, there is provided a non-clear (also referred to as a non-transparent or translucent to opaque) cleansing bar comprising: (a) from about 3 to about 40 weight % anionic soap; (b) from about 4 to about 40 weight % of at least one synthetic surfactant; (c) from 0.1 to about 10 weight % of a gelling agent from the group consisting of dibenzylidene sorbitol, dibenzylidene xylitol, dibenzylidene ribitol, and mixtures thereof; (d) from about 5 to about 60 weight % of a humectant provided that glycerin is a component of the humectant and is present in an amount of about 2 to about 10 weight %; and (e) water (particularly in a range of 14-45 weight % and more particularly as a minimumof about 17 weight % and a maximum of about 20,25, 30, or 35 weight % of the bar composition); wherein all amounts are in % by weight based on the weight of the entire composition.<br><br>
4       Additionally other optional ingredients maybe included such as one or more members selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(f) from 0 to about 5 wt. % of one or more secondary structurants selected from the group consisting of (i) cellulose and guar derivatives, including but not limited to hydroxypropyl cellulose; (ii) acrylic acid polymers; (iii) polyacrylamides; (iv) alkylene/alkylene oxide polymers; (v) clays such as smectite hydropbilic and/or organo clays; (vi) hydrated aad fumed silicas (vii) gelatin; (ix) xanthan and guar gums; (x) carrageenan; (xi) agar; and (xii) alginates; and (g) 0.2-3 weight % of a monohydric alcohol such as 0.1-2 weight % of an alcohol selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol, especially ethanol.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The aniom'c soap that is used is a long chain alkyl (C12-18) with some unsaturation possible, and may have up to 20% of bonds as a carboxylic acid salt (sodium, potassium, ammonium or hydroxyethyl ammonium cations). While the overall amount of the soap is in the range of 3-40 %, more particular ranges include a minimum of about 5 or 10 weight % of the composition, and a maximum of about 25, 30, or weight % of the composition. Thus, one particular range may be from 5-30 weight %, with other particular ranges being from 5-25 weight %, 10-30 weight % and 10-25 weight %.<br>

composition. Generally, this is about 0.5 to about 4 weight % of the composition preferably about 1.0 to about 3.0 weight %;<br>
(b)	glyceryl esters comprising a subgroup of esters which are primarily fatty acid<br>
monoglycerides, diglycerides or triglycerides modified by reaction with other alcohols<br>
and the like; particularly fatty acids having a carbon chain of 12 to 18 carbons (for<br>
example, PEG 6 caprylic/capric triglycerides, PEG 80 glyceryl cocoate, PEG 40<br>

These skin feel materials can be used in relatively minor quantities that are from about Q.05 to about 3 to 4 weight % of each of these as long as skin feel, wear rate, and translucency are maintained. Mixtures of conditioning agents can also be used.<br>
More particular examples of skin feel conditioning agents that maintain translucency and provide a nice skin feel when added to a translucent composition of the invention at a level of 2 weight % are those selected from the group consisting of: soybean oil, PEG 6 caprylic/capric triglycerides, PEG 80 glyceryl cocoate, PEG 40 glyceryl cocoate, PEG 35 soy glycerides, caprylic/capric triglycerides, PEG 8, dimethicone, PEG/PPG-22/24 dimethicone, silicone quaternimn-8, dimethicone PEG-7<br>
isostearate, petrolatum, lanolin quat {quaternium-33), capric/caprylic triglycerides, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, and mixtures of the foregoing.<br>
The pearlescent compositions of this invention contains may comprise mica at about 0.1 to 1 weight %<br>
The opaque composition of this invention contains an opacifying agent, such as titanium dioxide, at about 0.1 to 1 wt%.<br>
The bar compositions of this invention may be made in a variety of ways. The translucent, pearlized/pearlescent, or opaque compositions may be prepared according to standard procedures know in the art by pressing (molding) or pouring (cast) methodologies, i.e., placing a liquid into a mold. A preferred procedure is to mix and heat the water and humectants, including glycerin, to 80 degrees C to 110 degrees C. Once at temperature, the mixture is charged with the gellant and mixing is continued until the batch is clear. At this time a secondary structurant (for example, see U.S. Patent Number 6,S14,919 under the term "synergists11) would also be added if utilized. Once the structurant(s) are dissolved, the surfactants are mixed in until uniform. At a temperature of less than 90 degrees C, the optional ingredients are incorporated. The molten soap is then poured into a mold and allowed to cool to a solid form.<br>
Sample formulations of the invention include the following. All quantities, unless otherwise noted, are in weight percent based on the entire composition.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
In a special embodiment of this invention, translucent bars can be made with beads of encapsulated fats/oils or emollient esters.<br>
The range of water can be altered as the level of surfactants, soap, or humectants are altered. La order to maintain bar hardness and clarity the ratio of the soaps used is important The soap is usually comprised of the soluble salts of stearate, myristate, and cocoate. By altering the ratio of the longer chained stearate to the shorter chained myristate one can create a hard, translucent bar soap. For such hard, translucent soaps particular ratios of stearate:myristate are 1.5 to 3.5:1, preferably about 1.6 to 2.25:1. The levels of humectants can also be altered, the range of dipropylene glycol is from 0 to 6 weight % and the range of propylene glycol is 14 to 22 %. The surfactant levels can be manipulated to alter the lamer profile where sodium laureth sulfate can vary from 10 to 14 weight %, disodium lauryl sulfbsuccinate can vary from 2 to 6 weight %, sodium lauryl sulfate can vary from 2 to 6 weight % and cocamide monoethanolamide ("CMEA") can vary from 0 to 3 weight %. Soybean oil in the formula examples above serves as a placeholder for emollients/skin conditioning materials. All of these can be used to produce translucent bars.<br>
One particular embodiment is a translucent, pearlized, or opaque composition comprising (a) about 3 to about 40 wt % soap, (b) about 4 to about 40 wt. % of at least one synthetic surfactant, (c) about 14 to about 45 wt % water, (d) from 0 to about 3 wt. % lower monohydnc alcohol, (e) about 5 to about 60 wt. % of a humectant where about 2 to 10 wt % is glycerin, (f) from 0 to about 5 wt % of a structurant, (g) from 0.1 to about 1.5 wt. % of dibenzylidene sorbitol as a gelling agent.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention is useful in reducing the bar wear rate while having excellent cleansing and foaming properties.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples are offered as illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limitations thereon. In the Examples and elsewhere in the description of the invention, chemical symbols and terminology have their usual and customary meanings. ID the Examples as elsewhere in this application values for n, m, etc. in formulas, molecular weights and degree of ethoxylation or propoxylation are averages. Temperatures are in degrees C unless otherwise indicated. The amounts of<br>
the components are in weight percents based on the standard described; if no other standard is described then the total weight of the composition is to be inferred. Various names of chemical components include those listed in the CTFA International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionery (Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Inc., 7th ed. 1997).<br>
Examples 1-2 and Comparatives 1-2<br>
Each of the exemplified compositions can be prepared in a similar manner by combining the ingredients in a heated vessel. A bar can be made with the types and amounts of ingredients listed in Table A, using the following method. Mix and heat the water, cocoamidopropyl betaine, and  humectants, including glycerin, to 80 degrees C to 110 degrees C. Once at temperature, the mixture is charged with the gellant and mixing is continued until the batch is clear. Once the gellant is fully dissolved, the sodium chloride is added. Once the sodium chloride is dissolved, the remaining surfactants are mixed in until uniform. Following the surfactants, if desired, stearyl alcohol, a structurant, is added and mixed until clear. At a temperature of less than 90 degrees C, the optional ingredients are incorporated. The molten soap is men poured into a mold and allowed to cool to a solid form.<br>
The samples made according to the formula described in TABLE A were tested for bar wear and the results are also listed in TABLE A. The test bars were washed under controlled time and temperature for a total of 9 washes. Each wash lasted 30 seconds. Bar weight was taken before the test and after a 24 hour drying period (from<br><br>
the time of the last wash). Because the use up rate is proportional to the bar surface area, consistent shapes were used when making comparisons.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Comparatives 1 and 2 are bars made as described in Examples 1 and 2, using the dibenzylidene sorbitol as a gellant, but without glycerin. A second difference in the Comparatives from the Examples is the surfactant system. Differences are as follows.<br>
The bar compositions in Example 1 and 2 (with different amounts of stearate soap) were found to improve use up rate. The reduction of stearate soap, increases the bar<br>
use-up in Example 2 and Comparative 2 when compared to Example 1 and Comparative 1.<br>
Examples 3-6: Stearyl Alcohol-Free Formulations<br>
The following samples were prepared using the method in Example 1, but without the use of stearyl alcohol as a structurant. The only variations between the samples in TABLE C are the glycerin and DBS levels. Note, for the use-up data, two bars were used for each Example formulation evaluated The use-up tests were done using the procedure described above.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 6, which includes the combination of glycerin and DBS, has the lowest use up rate and is significantly different from all other samples, including the addition of DBS or glycerin alone. Statistical significance was defined using the Student T-Test, 2 tailed well known in the art. The p-values are displayed above. The composition of Example 6 was found to have a surprising effect that improved use up, even when a structurant, stearyl alcohol, is removed from the formula.<br>
Examples 7-11; Formulations Including Sodium Chloride<br>
Examples 7-11 as listed in TABLE D were prepared using the method described in Examples 3-6. In Examples 7-11 the sodium chloride level is at 1 %.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* The two samples in Example 11 had different results for bar wear beyond the expected sample to sample variation. This unexpected result may have been due to operator error in washing time, water temperature fluctuations, or excess water in the soap dish during the testing.<br>
In the test run using Examples 7,8,9,10, and 11, the data showed an anomaly. Samples containing DBS and glycerin had an average use up rate that was higher than the other examples. The p-value for the Example 11 indicates that it is only significantly different from the negative control (no additives for use-up). This is likely due to the large variation in the results within Example 11.<br>
Examples 12-17; Variation in Sodium Chloride and Sucrose Another set of bars was prepared following the method of Example 1, but without stearyl alcohol and with variations in the sodium chloride and sucrose levels.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In the Example 17 above, the combination of DBS and glycerin improved use up rate, and was significantly different from the other formulations without this combination and with varying levels of sucrose and sodium chloride.  This test was performed separately and variations from the previous tests are believed to have resulted from environmental conditions and operator variability.<br>
Example 18; Definition of Clarity and Evaluation of Bar Clarity<br>
For Example 18, a bar was made using the procedure described for Example 1. The clarity of bars from Examples 1,2 and 18 were evaluated using percent transmittance by placing a 1cm thick sample of the bar in the beam of a spectrophotometer whose range includes the visible spectrum, such as a Shimadzu UV 160 U Spectrophometer. Within the context of this invention, a bar is deemed to be transparent (clear) if the maximum transmittance of light of any wavelength in the range 400-800 nm through a 1 cm sample is at least 35%, preferably at least 50%. The bar is deemed translucent if the maximum transmittance of such light through the sample is between 2% and less than 35%. A bar is deemed opaque if the maximum transmittance of such a light is less than 2%. This definition is based on European Patent Application Publication Number 291,334 A2. Thus, there are differences between transparent (clear), translucent, and opaque compositions. In an alternative view, a definition of clear or transparent composition allows for ready viewing of an object behind it. A translucent composition, although light passes through, scatters light in such a manner that it is impossible to clearly identify objects behind the translucent bar. Opaque bars do not permit light to pass through. An alternative definition that is standard to the trade for translucent is the visual perception of transmittance of any light through a 1/4 inch thick portion of the bar. Transparency may be defined as the ability to read 14 point type though a quarter inch thick section of the bar. For purposes of this invention, the quantitative definition of light transmittance will be used.<br>
Samples made according to Example 1 were tested with the method described above. Each sample was evaluated with a minimum of two readings. The average results are shown below in TABLE E. Note that the clarity of bars, with compositions of the invention, were found to have a maximum transmittance at 800 nm.<br>
The bars from Examples 1,2 and 18 were deemed to be translucent. Transparency can be increased, however, by pouring the formulations at a low fill temperature for example in the range of 55-60 degrees, particularly about 57 degrees C. <br>
