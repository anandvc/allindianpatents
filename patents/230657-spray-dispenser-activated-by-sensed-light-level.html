BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Some preferred forms of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, or which:<br>
Figure 1	is a cross section view showing part of a dispenser,<br>
Figure 2 is a cross section view showing detail of part of the dispenser, and<br>
Figure 3	shows a freight container of a type suitable for use with the<br>
Invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to figures 1 and 2, a preferred form of the invention comprises a dispenser 1 which .can be fitted to an aerosol canister 2. The canister 2 contains a quantity of a light sensitive agrochemical, for example a suitable pesticide. The canister 2 is screw fitted to the dispenser 1, and can be subsequently released and replaced when empty.<br>
The dispenser 1 comprises an outer housing 3 having an aperture 4 connected to a fluid spray nozzle 5. When the dispenser releases a spray of the pesticide it proceeds from the nozzle 5. An activation switch 6 is provided to turn the dispenser on or off.<br><br>
The dispenser 1 has a light sensing switch 7 electrically connected to a circuit board 8 and power supply in the form of a battery 9. An LED warning light 10 flashes when the invention is switched on. The dispenser also contains a solenoid valve 11 connected to the canister 2 by way of a valve extension 12 The light sensing switch 7, the circuit board 8, the LED warning light 10, and the valve 11 are all powered by the battery 9.<br>
When the dispenser is turned “on” the light sensing switch 7 senses the level of light in the immediately surrounding environment. Typically a freight container is dark inside when its door is closed. On sensing a dark condition the switch sends a signal which is processed by the circuit board 8. In relation to the sensing switch 7, it should be understood that the term “dark” is not intended to only convey a total absence of light. The term should be taken as also embracing dim light conditions. The dispenser 1 may thus function in conditions which are less than pitch black. On receiving the signal from the light sensing switch 7 the circuit board 8 causes the valve 11 to open and close at predetermined intervals. Each time the valve opens a quantity of the pesticide proceeds from the canister 2, through the dispenser 1, and into the atmosphere. This may continue for a preset period of time or until the canister is exhausted. The dispenser 1 can thus sanitise a container while it is in transit to eradicate undesired life forms within the container.<br>
Preferably the dispenser 1 is such that once turned on for dispensing it cannot be turned off until it has completed a pre-set cycle of dispensing. Once the cycle is complete an indication is given, for example a particular colour of light is emitted by the warning light 10. All of this prevents the dispenser 1 from being deliberately or inadvertently deactivated before it has completed a dispensing cycle and has thus done its work within the container. The canister 2 may be such that once it is fitted to the dispenser it cannot be removed - ie to reduce the likelihood of deliberate or inadvertent interference with the dispensing cycle<br>
In some forms of the invention a removable bar code label may be included wherein the bar code gives details of the contents of the canister 2 The label can<br><br>
be removed from the canister 2, or from the dispenser 1 generally, and can be scanned by authorities to make sure that the correct dispensable material has been used and that the container has thus been properly treated.<br>
The life forms treated by the dispenser may be micro-organisms, insects (including spiders), mice, rats, snakes, etc. The dispenser may thus substitute more expensive and traditional container fumigation techniques. On sensing a high level of light, for example when the container door is opened, the sensing switch 7 causes the dispenser 1 to stop dispensing.<br>
When the dispenser is in use it may be fitted to the wait of a freight container, for example of the type shown in figure 3 and at the position demonstrated at 13. The dispenser 1 and canister 2 may be fitted by way of a self adhesive portion or by way of a suitable bracket. If desired, the dispenser may be placed at ground level or at any other part of the container as appropriate.<br>
Figure 2 provides additional detail of the dispenser valve 11. As shown, the valve 11 has a plastic housing 14, a steel inner container 15, an armature 16, electrical bobbin windings 17, a plastic bobbin 18, a spring 19, and a rubber valve seat 20. When a current passes through the windings 17 the armature moves away from the valve seat 20 to enable spray material to escape via the spray nozzle 5. The spring 19 causes the armature to return to a sealed position when current ceases to flow in the winding 17. The steel container 15 serves to enhance the magnetic field produced within the valve<br>
In preferred forms of the invention the dispenser 1 may involve the following features, either atone or in any desired combination;<br>
(a) The ability to spray pesticide in very fine droplet sizes able to permeate most or all of the unoccupied area within a shipping container. Dispersal of the spray may be facilitated by way of convection air currents which can naturally<br><br>
occur within a shipping container. This enables pesticide, etc, to reach insects or other pests hidden within the cargo.<br>
(b)	The ability to release pesticide, etc,, as a fine spray which evaporates almost immediately on leaving the spray nozzle 5. When this occurs the pesticide, etc, molecules are free to fill the vacant space within the shipping container by way of Brownian movement. This also assists the pesticide to reach insects or the like hidden within the cargo.<br>
(c)	The ability to release pesticide in only dark conditions facilitates the use of non-residual pesticidal chemicals, for example natural pyrethrins and some pyrethroids. These chemicals are generally unstable in light and therefore are more effective in the dark. These chemicals are also rapidly broken down in natural light, for example sunlight, when the shipping containers are opened at the destination. The chemicals may thus be non-residual and safe for people unloading shipping containers or using the same containers in the future.<br>
(d)	The choice of non-residual light sensitive pesticides or other chemicals, for example if the cargo comprises foodstuffs or other horticultural products. Preferably the pesticides, etc, are chosen for an ability to break down to harmless substances within a few hours in light conditions.<br>
(e)	The ability to dispense automatically enables a regular timed release of pesticide to kill hatching insects, moving insects, etc.<br>
(f)	The ability to effect automatic sprayed emissions of the pesticide for a period of 1 to 26 weeks without the need for human intervention once the dispenser<br>
is set.<br>
(g)	Full portability so that the dispenser can be placed virtually anywhere within a shipping container.<br><br>
(h) The use of a low voltage battery electronic circuit to minimise the risk of fire damage to the contents of a container.<br>
(i) The ability for use as a single trip dispenser or one which can be recovered<br>
and re-used.<br>
(j) Portability which facilitates use of multiple dispensers within a shipping container depending on the expected level of infestation, risk of hazardous pests, and container size.<br>
(k) The ability for use with various aerosol canister formulations for different needs. Various canisters may be numerically coded to enable ready compliance with bio-security requirements for different types of cargo. A loading or shipping supervisor can easily select the appropriate aerosol<br>
canister by its number and can fit it to a dispenser for use in a shipping container. This aerosol canister code is then able to be checked by the destination bio-security department and if it is incorrect the shipping container may be closed and fumigated in a conventional way.<br>
in preferred forms of the invention its users may enjoy commercial benefits over at least some traditional container fumigation techniques, including operational savings, reduced levels of chemicals in the atmosphere, reduced labour costs, and a lesson requirement for storing and mixing potentially hazardous concentrated 75 agrochemicals.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that preferred forms of the invention address traditional delays associated with holding shipping containers at port for either fumigation or full inspections, and commercial costs directly associated with extra 30 storage, extra fumigation, inspections, etc. The use of the invention may reduce Government casts for effective bio-security at borders.<br><br>
Preferably the dispenser is formed so that the duration of each burst of spray can be regulated. The dispenser may also allow for the delay between each timed burst to be regulated.<br>
Some embodiments the invention involve the use of light sensitive safe pesticides, with canister aerosol pressure provided by non-toxic and non-flammable propellant chemicals. Alternatively a ‘bag in a can” system may be employed. The dispensable materials used with the invention may be in liquid or gas form. The materials may be dissolved of dispersed in a liquid or gaseous phase to be dispensed as a spray in a controlled and continuous flow within and throughout a sea freight or airfreight container.<br>
While the invention has been described by way of example, it should be appreciated that modifications or improvements can occur without departing from the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
