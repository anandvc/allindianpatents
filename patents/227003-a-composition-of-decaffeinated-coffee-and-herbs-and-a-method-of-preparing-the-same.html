This invention relates to a coffee substitute which is non-addictive and has substantially the same flavour and aroma of convention coffee beverage comprising a blend of 15 to 25% of decaffeinated coffee beans powder, 10 to 25% lotus seeds powder, 5 to 25% of chicory root powder, 10 to 25% of soya beans powder, 5 to 15% of fenugreek seeds powder, 5 to 25% of tamarind seeds powder, 5 to 25% of wheat powder and 5 to 25% of sugar, wherein the said lotus seeds, chicory root, soya beans, fenugreek seeds, tamarind seeds and wheat are dry roasted and powdered before blending it with decaffeinated coffee bean powder, the sugar is added in form of caramel or burnt sugar, said decaffeinated coffee beans is obtained by immersing commercial coffee beans in water with subsequent solar and microwave heating at least once, separating the aqueous extract containing caffeine and essential oils therefrom, removing caffeine from said aqueous extract and thereafter soaking said decaffeinated coffee beans in the decaffeinated aqueous extract containing aromas and essential oils, drying and roasting said coffee beans. The composition contains decaffeinated coffee particularly but not exclusively by a process developed by us in combination with selected herbs and spices which exhibit medicinal properties and also function as coffee extenders. The composition may optionally have spices and other herbs added thereto for distinct and desired flavours and aromas.<br>
Beverages with or without milk or dairy whitners, iced herbal coffee preparations and other food items such as ice creams, cakes, puddings, jams, chocolates, toffees, burgers and the like may be prepared from the composition of our invention.<br>
The low caffeine content of the product makes it safe for consumption by one and all children and invalids including cancer, diabetic and peptic ulcer patients.<br>
A paste made out of the composition according to our invention in admixture with fresh lime juice, sugar and glycerine is found to be an excellent softening agent and may be used as a cosmetic for softening rough skin in palms, soles of legs, knee joints etc.<br><br>
Caffeine content in a cup of percolated coffee may range from 80-100 mg per cup depending upon the source of coffee and the process of extraction.      Caffeine   is  addictive  and  a   large  amount  of caffeine consumption may lead to sleeplessness muscular pain, valvular heart disease, hyper tension (cerebral heart tension, ischemic heart disease (heart attacks) nervous debility, parkinson disease, per pepticular syndrome etc.    In view of this,<br>
mere is a long felt need for specially processed herbal and spiced coffee with low caffeine value, having medicinal properties. The composition of this invention may be in the form of powder, tablets and liquid extracts and may be sweetened by herbal sweetners or sugar or sugar substitutes. Natural preservatives like neem extracts may also be added to the composition to enhance shelf life.<br>
This invention relates to a composition of decaffeinated coffee and herbs essentially consisting of 15 to 25% of decaffeinated coffee beans, 10 to 25% of lotus seeds, 5 to 25% of chichory root, 10 to 25% of soya beans, 5 to 15% of fenugreek seeds, 5 to 25% of tamarind seeds, 5 to 25% wheat and 5 to 25% of sugar.<br>
The composition described herein above may optionally contain 10 to 15% of barley, 10 to 25% of acorns, 5 to 25% of Burdoc root, 15 to 25% of California coffee berry, 5 to 25% of Dandelion, 10 to 25% of sow thistle, 3 to 10% of Beleric myrobalan, 3 to 10% of Senna leaves, 5 to 15% of Indian spice Khas khas seeds (poppy seeds) 10 to 20% of date seed either alone or in combination with one another.<br><br>
Spices and herbs may be added to the composition. Spices and herbs described herein below may also be used either alone or in combination. They are cinnamon bark, cardamom, rose, saffron, ginger, Indian sarasaparilla, nutmeg, celery, clove, cocoa beans, lemon peel, orange peel and carob pods without hard seeds.<br>
In addition to the above, the composition may contain herbal sweetner such as dried leaves of Stevia Rebaudiana which is thirty times sweeter than sugar. This sweetner is calorie free and has permissible hypoglycemic, antifungal, hypotensive and vasodialatory properties. Dried powder of this herb in the range of 0.5 to 2% may be added to the composition described hereinabove and may replace artificial and other sweetners in food preparations using the composition.<br>
Dried neem leaves which is a natural preservative may be added to the composition in the range of 1.0 to 5.0%. This prevents the growth of pathogenic micro organisms in the composition.<br>
Coffee beans may be decaffeinated in any manner known in the art. However, the decaffeination process developed by the invention is far superior to the existing processes of aqueous and solvent treatment for decaffeination.<br><br>
CONVENTIONAL DECAFFEINATION (PRIOR ART DECAFFEINATION) : Involves heating of coffee beans immersed in water using electrical heaters or stoves using conventional fuels. In this method of decaffeination, coffee beans get heated starting from outer layer and gradually to the core of the beans to bring out caffein in uncontrolled way. Further, the process consumes more power. The present invention for decaffeination is through 2 stage decaffeination. The first stage is by solar heating where no power or fuel is used and the second stage decaffeination is through micro wave heating - wherein the core of coffee bean gets heated first gradually heating subsequent layers and finally the outermost layer. This helps in a controlled way of decaffeination which is a novel feature according to the invention.<br>
HIGH FREQUENCY MICROWAVE DECAFEINATION : The present invention follows an unique method of non-conventional process having several advantages in a 2 stage decaffeination taking advantage of recent technological developments. In microwave decaffeination, coffee seed core gets heated first and then heat moves to outer layers and decaffeination takes place in a controlled manner and in an economical way.<br>
FIRST STAGE DECAFFEINATION which is explained below is a preparatory process for subsequent decaffeination of second stage by super high frequency microwave heating.<br>
According to this process cleaned coffee beans are completely soaked in fresh soft water and heated in solar heater preferably for 90 to 120 minutes. The pores of coffee beans open up partially and heated water partially extracts caffein from soaked beans. As this process does not consume fuel or power it is economical and reduces the cost of decaffeination. This process of first stage decaffeination is repeated at least twice.<br>
Aqueous extract from the first stage decaffeination containing dissolved caffein, essential oils and aromas is separated, and filtered through a unique filteration system containing activated carbon and fine grain charcoal. This process helps in absorption of caffein alone.<br>
The filtering equipment consists of a main vessel provided with a detachable top and bottom end assemblies. A filtering disc having a plurality of small holes is mounted on the bottom dished end assembly. The bottom dished end assembly is provided with an outlet provided with a closure member. The dished end top assembly is provided with an inlet and an impeller drivable by a variable speed geared motor. When mounted, the<br><br>
impeller with its blades and shaft will be centrally housed within the main vessel. The main vessel consists of a glass guage system attached thereto to indicate the level of solution present in the main vessel. This glass gauge is attached by means of conventional clamping systems. A U shaped member provided with several small holes or perforations seals, the lower end of the gauge within the main vessel, thus allowing only the solvent to enter therethrough to the gauge. Filtering medium consisting of charcoal and activated carbon is introduced into the main vessel and thereafter the aqueous extract collected by the decaffeination process of coffee beans is allowed to percolate therethough with occasional stirring with the impeller. The glass gauge indicates the level of the extract contained in the main vessel. Preferably 33% of activated carbon granules and 67% of charcoal granules are packed in the main filtering vessel. This absorbs caffein from the aqueous extracts. Periodically the outlet closure member is opened and the aqueous solution freed from caffein but containing essential and aromatic oils from the coffee bean is collected. This process of filtration may be repeated in a serial manner to completely decaffeinate the aqueous extract.<br>
After first stage of decaffeination aqueous extract free from caffein, but containing fair amount of essential oils and aromas is poured into micro wave proof container to which wet and partially decaffeinated beans (separated after first stage decaffeination) are added and prepared for second stage of decaffeination.<br>
SECOND STAGE OF DECAFFEINATION : This deploys super high frequency micro wave heating on already prepared above mixture of coffee beans having pores already opened with aqueous solution<br><br>
free of caffein. This superior technology of super high frequency micro wave heating brings out caffein in a controlled manner to meet required level of decaffeination. Micro waves first heat the core of coffee beans and then progressively heat the subsequent layers. Thus the process is much superior, efficient, faster and well controllable compared to conventional decaffeination. The new method described in this patent is innovative and economical due to lower amount of power consumption compared to conventional decaffeiantion.<br>
After acheiving the required amount of decaffeination, wet coffee beans are separated from the aqueous solution containing caffein, essential oils and aroma.<br>
Aqueous solution is passed through the filtering system used earlier to filter out caffein generated in second stage of decaffeination.<br>
Add wet seeds separated above to the aqueous solution free of caffein but containing essential and allow it to settle.<br>
Decaffeinated coffee beans absorbs the essential oils and aroma. Coffee beans free of caffein is separated and dried to remove moisture content thereof. Drying can be economically acheived by exposing the wet beans to direct sun light to start with and susbequently followed by solar heating which is once again an unique feature of this invention not practised in conventional decaffeination.<br>
Taste of conventional coffee is mainly due to presence of caffein and essential oils with aroma. But caffein has its own ill effects as explained earlier. Only restricted amount of caffein intake is permitted. Hence the need of controlled decaffeinated coffee blended with suitably processed herbs having taste of coffee arises.<br>
This innovation not only restricts use of controlled decaffeinated coffee but also identifies / modifies healthy herbs in the form of seeds, roots and other substances / materials converted by suitable processes to achieve taste similar to that of coffee are explained. Further, in subsequent paras after conducting trials and experiments in arriving at various compositions and specifications in which combination of decaffeinated coffee with specifically processed herbs and spices including<br><br>
natural preservatives and sweeteners (to contribute to 0 calories) to produce herbal coffee having taste and aroma similar to coffee but at the same time having much less caffein content.<br>
Thus an invention of herbal coffee produced in various composition and proportion given separately under "claims" has taste and aroma similar to coffee virtually very much restricting the use of conventional coffee having undesirable element of caffein. Coffee addicts will be satisfied with the above mentioned herbal coffee facilitating maintenance of quality life.<br>
Lotus seeds used in the composition may be subjected to conventional cleaning methods. Immature lotus seeds having thin outer skins are then separated therefrom and the segregated matured seeds are heated in a solar heater initially and then microwave roasted. Initial solar heating reduces energy consumption. Microwave roasting is carried out with occasional stirring till the seeds are dark brown in colour.<br>
For most benifical results chocory roots must be dug out before the plant starts flowering. The dug out roots may be washed with water to remove mud and sand adhered thereto. An equipment designed by us may be used successfully for the removal of any residual impurities which may be present in the roots after the initial washing. This equipment may be used for refining and cleaning herbs and is not exclusive to cleaning of chicory roots.<br><br>
The device for cleaning herbs consists of a main shell assembly fabricated with at least four shells and six angles. These shells are provided with perforations to allow soil, mud and other containments to pass through. The shell assembly is rotatably mounted on pedestals of different heights. These pedestals also house a driving roller assembly and an idler roller assembly. The difference in the height of the pedestals depends on the required inclination of shell assembly mounted thereon. A hollow shaft is<br>
provided within the shell assembly and is mounted on the pedestals. This fixed shaft is provided with at least four cone assemblies. A collection tray is provided at the base for collecting containments. The main shell assembly is provided with an inlet and an outlet for supply of articles to be cleaned and for its collection repsectively. An electromagnetic assembly located within the main shell assembly is intended for removal of ferrous and other metallic containments, if present. The diameter and the pitch distance between perforations present in the shell assembly may be varied depending on the type and nature of the impurities to be cleared. Inclination of the main shell assembly with respect to the pedestals may also adjusted to regulate easy flow of the herb and impurities.<br>
Herbs to be cleaned are charged into the main shell assembly and then the variable speed geared motor is switched on to drive the drive roller assembly which in turn rotates the main shell assembly. Due to slow rotation, the herbs travel slowly along the shell and fall on the cones mounted over the shafts. The speed of rotation and the inclination of the shell assembly is adjusted such mat and sand and the like impurities collect in the collecting tray. Electromagnets remove any ferrite materials present in the herbs. Refined and decontaminated herbs flow out through the outlet after passing through at least four successive cones mounted on the shaft.<br><br>
Decontaminated herbs are cut to the desired size and then roasted till the desired colour is achieved. Chicory powder free of any pathogenic microorganisms is obtained by powdering the roasted and decontaminated chicory roots.<br>
Soya bean powder incorporated in this composition may be produced from dehusked soya beans. Dehusking may be effected by soaking soya beans in water and physically removing the skin from thesoaked beans. This is roasted preferably in a microwave oven which helps in retaining its medicinal value. Roasted soya bean may be ground to the desired size for incorporation in the composition.<br>
Fennugreek seeds are known to possess blood sugar lowering properties. Fennugreek seeds may be roasted in the microwave oven till the desired brown colour is achieved. As in the case of soya beans, microwave heating retains its inherent medicinal value. The browned seeds may be powdered and added to the composition.<br>
Tamarind seeds are also processed in a similar way by cleaning and roasting. Roasting is preferably done in a solar heater for about 20 hours till the moisture content is fully removed. After slow roasting, the seeds may be powdered and added to the composition.<br><br>
Different wheat varieties available may be used in this composition. Initial roasting is carried out by exposing the same to sunlight which may be heated in the microwave till the desired brown colour is obtained.<br>
Sugar crystals are subjected to slow roasting in the conventional manner till brown caramel is produced which is ground and stored in air tight containers for addition to the composition.<br>
Barley, Beleric myrobaian, California coffee berry, acorns and date seeds may be cleaned and roasted in the microwave oven before powdering.<br>
Burdoc, dandelion and sow thistle roots may be processed like the chocory roots and then powdered.<br>
Senna leaves, may be initially heated in a solar heater and then exposed to infra red drying  before powdering.<br>
Indian spice Khas khas are also microwave roasted after cleaning and<br>
then powdered.<br>
Flavouring agents and other herbs may be cleaned, sun dried and solar heater dried and then powdered. These powders are then exposed to infra red drying which eliminates pathogenic microorganisum therefrom.<br><br>
It is to be understood that powders  of all the herbs and spices are infrared treated prior to formation of the composition.<br>
The composition according to this invention is not a simple admixture but is synergestic in nature each component complementing and enhancing the properties of the others.<br>
The composition is specially recommended for one and all, children, diabetic, cancer and peptic ulcer patients. Patients suffering from hypertension also will benefit by this composition.<br>
