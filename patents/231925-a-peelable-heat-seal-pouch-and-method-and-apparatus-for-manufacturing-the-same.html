				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a peelable heat seal pouch for packing the products like medical devices or implants, and method and apparatus for manufacturing the same. The present invention relates to the peelable heat seal for thermoplastic films without surface preparation.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br><br><br>
One of the important packaging modes for packing the medical devices is to enclose the said medical device in a pouch made of any thermoplastic film. Various materials, such as polyethelene, polyethelene-polyester and ethyl vinyl acetate are used to make the said film.<br><br><br>
The presently known pouches for packing of the said medical device or any such product, which may include the food products or the implants etc. and the method of manufacturing thereof comprises of manufacturing the pouch from the said films by heat sealing the said films. The known methods of heat sealing are simplest and most reliable methods of making the pouches for packing the said products, by joining the said two films.<br><br><br>
The major drawback of such known pouches and of such known methods of manufacturing thereof is that the peelable character of the manufactured pouch is not achieved, that is the resulted pouch is non-peelable.<br><br><br>
The major drawback of such known non-peelable pouches is that the packed product can be removed only by cutting of one end of the such known pouch, which in-turn can be achieved <br>
by use of a pair scissors or of the knive. The use of pair of scissors or of knive in-turn causes contaimination of the packed product, which is the more serious problem in case of the medical device or of the implant.<br><br><br>
In order to overcome the drawbacks, as described herein above, of such known pouches for packing of the products, particularly the medical devices or the implants and of the method of manufacturing thereof, the another type of known such pouches are manufactured after subjecting the said film to a special surface preparation procedure, that is by applying the adhesive layer on the corners of the film before heat sealing the same. The sealing of such films is carried out by special methods under specifically controlled conditions.<br><br><br>
The major disadvantage of such known pouches prepared from a film after applying the adhesive on the corners thereof, is that the cost of the film is increased and further the reliability of the seal is reduced.<br><br><br>
Still further disadvantage of such known pouches and of method of manufacturing thereof, as stated herein above, is that the method of manufacturing of such pouches is more complex and is more expensive.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the current state of art is limited to non-peelable sealed pouches or to the peelable sealed pouches, which in-turn can be achieved by means of surface preparation, that is by applying the layer of adhesive.<br><br><br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION:<br><br><br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a pouch for packing the products, particularly the medical devices or implants and of method of manufacturing thereof, which can over come the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br><br><br>
This is the main object of the present invention to make a complete disclosure of a pouch for packing the products, particularly for packing of the medical devices or implants and of<br><br><br><br><br>
method of manufacturing thereof, which can overcome the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above.<br><br><br>
This is further an object of the present invention to make a complete disclosure of a pouch for packing the products, particularly for packing of the medical devices or implants and of method of manufacturing thereof, more particularly to make a complete disclosure of peelable heat seal pouch, and method and apparatus for manufacturing thereof, which can overcome the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above.<br><br><br>
This is still an object of the present invention to make a disclosure of a pouch and method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, wherein the said peelable heat seal is achieved without any surface preparation, that is without applying any adhesive onto the film.<br><br><br>
This is still further an object of the present invention to make a disclosure of a pouch and method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, wherein the desired/targeted level of peeling force can be obtained without the film going into the tear mode.<br><br><br>
Still further an object of the present invention is to make a disclosure of a pouch and method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, wherein the said method of manufacturing the peelable heat seal is convenient, simple and economical.<br><br><br>
Yet another an object of the present invention is to make a disclosure of a pouch and method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, wherein the said apparatus of manufacturing the peelable heat seal is convenient, simple and economical to design/manufacture.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION &amp; PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION:<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention makes a complete disclosure of a peelable heat seal pouch, and method and means of manufacturing thereof, particularly of a pouch having a peelable seal, for packing the products, like medical devices or implants and of method of manufacturing thereof, as briefly described herein above. <br>
Now referring to the enclosed figures (figure-i), a peel able heat seal pouch 1, manufactured in accordance to the mehtod amd means of the presently disclosed invention, is disclosed, wherein the films 2 and 3 are sealed, which comprises distributed seal points 4 with each seal point 4 being of very small size and said seal points 4 are preferably provided on both vertical 5 and both horizontal sides 6 and 7 of the said pouch 1. In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said seal points 4 are provided at least on one side 6 of the four sides 5, 6 and 7 of the said pouch 1 and said end 6 preferably forms a loose flap 7 for convenience of handeling of the sealed films 2 and 3 while opening of the said pealable seal 9, comprising of seal points 4. In accordance to this invention the said seal points 4 forming the said seal 9 are provided in one (fig.-lA and 2A), two (fig.-1B and iC, 2B and 2C) or three (fig.-ID and 2D) or so on lines. Further in accordance to the present invention the said seal points 4 are formed in a way that they are arranged in parrallel (fig.- 1 B and 2B) or alternate arrangement (fig.-IC and lD, 2C and 2D), which in-turn results in the better seal. The said seal points 4 are preferably of round shape (fig.- 1 and 2) or are preferentially tapered (fig. -3) in the form of an acute angle triangle 10. In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said round seal points 4 are preferably of diameter about 0.3 to 0.8 mm and the said acute angle triangle 10 preferably has the said acute angle corner 11 on the line of the peel seals 12 and the base 13 of the triangle 10 in the direction of the peel 12A. The sides 14 of the triangle<br><br>
10 forming the said acute angle 11 are preferably curved with the concavity formed to be into the body of the triangle 10 (fig.-3A) or are an acute angle trialgle 10 without any such concavity, as shown in fig.-3B.<br><br><br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said seal points 4 are achieved by heat sealing the said films 2 and 3 at a particular sealing temperature. However, the exact diameter and the sealing temperature can be selected to obtain the desired peel force for the specific type of the material of the film used. The seal contact points 4 generated in accordance to the method and means of the present invention, as described herein below, are althrough holes 15 provided in the said sealed films 2 and 3 having the sealing only on the area 15A of the said films 2 and 3 and no seal on the areas 16 (fig.3C).<br><br><br>
Further, in accordance to the present invention the said seal contact points 4 are generated/produced by means of pins 17. <br>
Still further, in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the said pins 17 are either single in number 17 (fig.-4C) or multiple in number, wherein the said multiple pins are in the form of a multiple teethed disc roller 18 (fig. -4A and 4B), and the said pin 17 or the said multiple teethed disc roller 18. The pin, in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises of a longitudinal body 19 and of a tip 20. The multi-teethed disc roller 18 comprises of a circular body 21 provided with a central hole 22 and number of tooth structures 23, which in-turn are preferably of equal size and width 24 and are preferably placed at equal distance 25 (fig.-4A). In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said tooth structures 23 may form an angle with the said body 21 (fig.-4B).<br><br><br>
Further in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the said multi-teethed disc rollers 18 are provided with number of tooth structures 23 made in single circumference (fig.-5A) or double circumference (fig.-5B) or triple circumference (fig.-SC) or so on to generate the said seals 9 comprising of said seal points 4 in one (fig.- 1 A and 2A), two (fig.1 B and IC, 2B and 2C) or three lines (fig. -1 D and 2D) or so on and to form the said seal points 4 in parrallel (fig.-IB and 2B) or alternate arrangement (fig.-lC and lD, 2C and 2D), which in-turn results in the better seal. In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the thickness of said tooth structure 23 reduces from its base 26 to its tip 27, that is if the said roller 18 is viewed in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the said roller 18 the said tooth structure 23 will be seen to be tapering towards said tooth tip 27 (fig.-5).<br><br><br>
In accordance to the method of manufacture of the said peelable heat seal pouches the said pin 17 or said roller 18 are fixed onto a heating means 28 (fig.-6 and 7), which does not restrict the scope of this invention, and are heated to the desired sealing temperature. The said seal points 4 forming the said seal 9 are achieved by heat sealing the said films 2 and 3 at a particular sealing temperature by means of heated said pins 17, which are of small diameter, as described herein above, and are pressed against or perforated into the two films 2 and 3 required to be sealed. The said pins 17 are allowed to move in direction 29 and said sealed films 2 and 3 with the said seal 9 are dragged away in a direction 30 by known means, not shown in the figure.<br><br><br>
Furhter in accordance to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the said seals 9 comprising of said seal points 4 are generated by means of said heated rollers 18, which <br>
4s allpwed to move onto the said films 2 and 3 being sealed and said sealed films 2/3 are being dragged by known means, not shown in the figures, in a direction 30. While the sealed films2/3 are being dragged the said roller 18 rotates in the direction 31 (fig.-6) and perforates the said films 2 and 3 to generate the said sealing contact points 4 onto the said films 2 and 3, which in-turn are sealed to form the peelable heat seal 9.<br><br><br>
Figures 6 and 7 show only one of the said roller 18 (fig.-6) or one of the said pin 17 (fig.7). However, for simultanous sealing of both the parallel sides of the said films 2 and 3 two of said rollers 18 or two of said pins 17 can be arranged independently through independent or same heating means 28 in parallel.<br><br><br>
Alternatively the said sealing contact points are achieved by hot air blast wherein the blast is in the form of small diameter jets or by means of laser points or by means of ultrasound sealing points.<br><br><br>
The distributed seal contact points, achieved in accordance to the present invention are easily peelable without causing any tearing of the pouch, because when it is attempted to peel apart the two films sealed together by heat sealing in accordance to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, as described herein above and below, the tearing does not occure due to the peeling force being less than the tear strength of the sealed films.<br><br><br>
The diameter of the pin 17, diameteral pitch of the tooth structure 23, the diameter of the roller 18, the temperature of the roller 18, thermal properties of the films 2 and 3, the pressure between the roller 18 and the films 2 and 3, and speed of effecting seals 9 are interrelated parameters, which have to be optimised taking together and may result in the alteration in constructional design of the presently disclosed pins 17 and/or roller 18, which are not to restrict the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
The present invention has been described with the help of the accompanying figures, which are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be resorted to without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
