				<td>An improved process for producing colorless water from the agro-industrial waste water.<br>
from agro-industry effluents. More particularly it relates to an electrochemical decolouration of the agro-industry waste like spent wash from alcohol distillery and black liquor from paper mill, wherein the high COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) comprising colouring matter along with the dissolved salts are removed by electro-coagulation and electro-oxidation, so that the treated colourless water can be recycled in the process itself or let into ecosystem since it meets norms laid down by statutory bodies. The present invention thus relates to an environmental friendly process for colour removal from the sugarcane based alcohol distillery effluent and papermill effluent after biomethanalion and/ or activated sludge process. More specifically the effluent containing mainly of lignin, caramels, melanoidins, and dissolved inorganics, is decolourized by electro-coagulation and electro-oxidation using electrochemical cell.<br>
Distillery effluent or spent wash is generated after molasses fermentation to ethyl alcohol and its recovery by distillation. Normally the process produces about 15 liters of the spent wash per liter of the alcohol. This discharged effluent has obnoxious odour, dark brown colour, acid pH and COD of about 1,20,000 and is difficult to treat. Biomethanation is the first treatment, wherein some organics are converted into methane rich gas, which is used as fuel for boiler. Biomethanation of the effluent reduces the COD upto 60 to 80% and the wastewater after biomethanation needs further treatment. This effluent still has COD about 25,000<br><br>
to 30.000mgl-1. Activated sludge is the secondary treatment, which generates the bacterial sludge using organic matter as a carbon source to give an effluent with COD ranging from 6,000- 8,000mgl'1 and has a dark brown colour. Electrolysis or electrochemical oxidation is a novel technique useful to treat wastewater containing difficult (refractory) organics. Its use has been restricted to laboratory scale only as seen from the review discussed here. Electrolysis  or electro-oxidation  technique  has  been  used  as  a "front-end" technology  ahead  of biological  treatment  with  the  objective  of detoxifying biorefractory contaminant(s) like chlorophenols (Polcaro and Palmas, in, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 36,1791-1798,1997). Simple effluents coming out from metal plating unit have been subjected to electrolysis to remove heavy metals and toxic organic materials (Kim, in, US patents No. 4445990,1984 and US patent 4556469, 1984). Kotz, (US patent, 4839007, 1988) attempted electrochemical oxidation of organic material from wastewater with different metal electrode doped by different ions to oxidize organic pollutants.<br>
Guaglianoni, L., (Papel, 55, 21-50, 1994) reports use of the Al and Fe or Carbon and Steel electrodes to treat high COD effluent. Free metal gets dissolved or highly corroded and should be replaced for the next batch.<br>
Electrochemical oxidation technique has been applied in the treatment of distillery spent wash. Berchman et al., (C.L.J. Berchman and Vijayavalli, in Indian J. Environ Hlth, 31, 309, 1989) diluted high COD raw spent wash 10 times with<br><br>
water and added 2-5 % sodium chloride before electro-oxidation. The colourless treated effluent had negligible COD/BOD values. Vijayaraghavan et al., (K. Vijayaraghavan, T. K. Ramanujan and N. Balasubramanium, in Ind. Eng. Chem Res. 38, 2264, 1999) also used high COD raw spent wash for electro-oxidation. They diluted spent wash to 10 to 20 times and carried out electro-oxidation in the presence of 2.5 to 3.0 % sodium chloride. The hypochlorous acid formed has been responsible for oxidation of organic matter present in spent wash. Presence of high amount of sodium chloride, current density of the order of 34 mA/cm2 and high residence time of 240 min will be account for high cost of treatment requiring huge : amount of energy of the order of 27-36 KWh/Cubic meter of spent wash. This technique will remain as a laboratory curiosity due to its requirement of high residence time and presence of too much salt in the treated effluent. Both these investigations have been tried using raw spent wash before recovery of energy via biomethanation technique (which has been made mandatory on the part of distilleries by central pollution control board). Thus this technique is not practical under Indian context. All other reports disclosed so far have following disadvantages,<br>
1.	use of high residence time<br>
2.	use of expensive electrodes<br>
3.	lack of employing effluent containing bio-refractory colouring matter like<br>
melanoidins, caramels and lignin, after spent wash  is given primary and /or<br><br>
Secondary treatment,<br>
4. Negligible removal of dissolved solids like Ca, Si etc.<br>
Hence for the applicability of the electro-chemical oxidation technique to industrial scale, the above mentioned drawbacks are to be addressed.<br>
Physico chemical treatment proves advocated by our copending patent (disco closed by Gokaran et al., (A.N. Gokarn, A.P. Joshi, N.V. Sankapal and B.D. Kulkani. Patent application No. 203/DEL/96 193284) also suffers from following drawbacks.<br>
1.	three steps process means a costly operations<br>
2.	large amount of sludge formed creates a problem of disposal of solid waste.<br>
Considering the above limitations it is evident that there is dire need of a simple<br>
and economic process for the treatment of distillery spent wash with a view to<br>
remove color and make it suitable for recycle or discharge in the ecosystem as a<br>
harmless effluent.<br>
It has been found for the first time in this invention that primary treated or secondary treated spend wash can be treated by electro-oxidation technique in the short time using catalytic amounts of flocculants and/or electrolytes.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for producing colorless water from the agro- industry effluents which comprises processing the agro-industrial waste water to obtain colorless water characterised in that precipitating the said agro-industrial waste water with di/tri-valent coagulants, allowing the effluent to settle for a period of 6 to 120 min, separating the transparent yellow coloured effluent by conventional methods, electrolysing the said effluent optionally in the presence of 0.2 to 1% electrolyte at a current density of 35 to 100 ma/cm2, for a period of 3 to 15 min., separating the heavy precipitate formed by conventional methods and removing the traces of chlorine by conventional methods to obtain colourless water.<br><br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention the di / trivalent coagulants used may be selected from Feds, FeS04, A1C13, or polychlorides of aluminum, or iron such as polyaluminium chloride.<br>
In another embodiment the electrolytes used to adjust the conductivity may be selected from inorganic salts such as sulfates, nitrates, chlorides of alkali metals, preferably sodium or potassium, and / or mineral acids such as dilute H2S04/ HCL.<br>
In still another embodiment the electrodes used for the electrolysis may be nonoxidizable and reusable electrodes, made of iron, aluminum, or triple oxide coated titanium.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the electrodes are sieve or rod shaped and or circular fashion with centered cathode.<br>
In, another feature, reactor used for the electro-coagulation is, with single compartment, where cathode and anode are at the distance of 2 to 20 mm. To bring.<br>
the effective reaction, further the reactor configuration can be modified for continuous mode operation.<br>
In still further feature the current used for the electrolysis may be either DC or AC having a current density of 35 to 100 ma/cm2'preferably DC current.<br>
In yet another feature, the iron and aluminium salts used could be obtained from the waste or as by-products from the other industries to reduce the cost of treatment.<br>
In another feature, low the residence time of 3 to 15 min. helps in making the process continuous and using a small size reactor.<br>
In yet another feature electro-coagulated clean water being acidic, may be neutralized using base in the form of oxide, hydroxide or carbonate of calcium, sodium, potassium at small concentration of the order of 0.2 to 2.0 g 1" .<br>
In yet another feature the spent wash and black liquor to be treated (after biomethanation and/ or activated sludge process) may preferably have characteristics as given in table-1 given below:<br>
