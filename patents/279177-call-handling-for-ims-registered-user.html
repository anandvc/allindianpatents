				<td>Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to performing call handling for a user having circuited-switched<br>
controlled user's equipment and being ported to a IMS domain.<br>
Background<br>
Third Generation (3G) Networks such as UMTS (Universal Telecommunication Network) and<br>
CDMA 2000 provide high-speed wireless Internet access to mobile users over a wide<br>
coverage area. For the 3G networks the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS has been defined to<br>
provide cellular access to the services of the Internet in order to support telephony and<br>
multimedia services. The IMS uses packet-switched technology, in particular IP-network and<br>
other IETF protocols for provision of services. The 2nd Generation networks, like GSM,<br>
provide voice based on a circuit-switched technology. The strength of IMS is the provision of<br>
enhanced Services, for example multimedia services combining voice and data. Further, the<br>
usage of IP-network as a single underlying standard allows an easy and fast service<br>
deployment.<br>
A Session Initiation Protocol SIP has been chosen in IMS for signalling between the user's<br>
equipment UE and the IMS as well as between the components within the IMS. The IMS<br>
uses SIP also to complete voice and multimedia calls in the Internet. In order to be able to<br>
use the IMS service, the communicating user's equipment has to support IMS, which means<br>
SIP has to be implemented in the user's equipment.<br>
In the following simplified network architectures of IMS is described. In particular the nodes<br>
being involved in provision of service in IMS architecture are mentioned.<br>
The components of the IMS system are the Call Session Control Function (CSCF), the<br>
Media Gateway (MGW)/Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF), the Home Subscriber<br>
Register (HSR), the Application Server (AS).<br>
The CSCF acts as a call server and handles call signalling, it supports and controls<br>
multimedia sessions and performs address translation functions. The CSCF can be<br>
functionally decomposed to S-CSCF, I-CSCF and P-CSCF. The Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is<br>
the first contact point in a IMS network and it provides authorization of bearer resources,<br>
further it forwards a SIP register request received from the User Equipment UE to an I-CSCF<br>
determined using the home domain name, as provided by the user. In the opposite direction<br>
 <br>
it forwards the SIP request or response to the UE. Moreover the CSCF forwards SIP<br>
messages received from the UE to a SIP server (S-CSCF) whose name the P-CSCF has<br>
received as a result of the registration procedure.<br>
The Interrogating - CSCF (I-CSCF) is the contact point within an operator's network for all<br>
connections destined to a subscriber of that network operator, or a roaming user currently<br>
located within that network operator's service area. There may be multiple l-CSCFs within an<br>
operator's network. The main function performed by the I-CSCF is assigning a S-CSCF to a<br>
user performing SIP registration.<br>
The Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) is the node that performs the session<br>
management for the IMS network. There can be several S-CSCFs in the network. The main<br>
functions of S-CSCF comprise: acceptation of registration requests from UE, interacting with<br>
services platforms for the support of services. Further it provides endpoints with service<br>
event related information (like for example notification of tones/announcement together with<br>
location of additional media resources, billing notification).<br>
The Home Subscriber Register HSR is the centralized subscriber database. The HSR<br>
interfaces with the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF to provide information about the location of the<br>
subscriber and the subscriber's subscription information. The HSR is responsible for holding<br>
the following user related information: user identification, numbering and addressing<br>
information, user security information for authentication and authorization. The HSR<br>
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information.<br>
The IMS supports several nodes for inter-working with legacy networks, like for example<br>
Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF).<br>
The MGCF performs protocol conversion between cellular call control protocols and IMS<br>
protocols. For example, the MGCF receives a SIP message from the CSCF and converts it<br>
into appropriate ISUP messages. Thus, the primary function of MGCF is to convert signalling<br>
information from one format to another in uplink and downlink direction. In UMTS this will<br>
predominantly be between Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) in the PSTN and an IP based<br>
format.<br>
The IMS Access Server hosts and executes services, the user requested for.<br>
 <br>
As already mentioned the UMTS system allows mobiles operating in packet mode to<br>
establish voice calls using SIP as the signalling protocol. The SIP messages are sent to<br>
communicate the request to the Call Session Control Function (CSCF) in the IMS. In this<br>
case, the data is transmitted as packets throughout the UMTS network.<br>
Thus, the IMS has been deployed for the 3G networks for provision of services using packet-<br>
switched technology with SIP as applied signalling protocol. However, currently the major<br>
numbers of users equipment do not support IMS technology with SIP as signalling protocol<br>
for voice service, since said user's equipment is adapted for a circuit-switched controlled<br>
domain. Thus, for the access to the IMS an adaptation of the user's equipment is necessary,<br>
which leads to the problem of exchanging the end terminals.<br>
Further problem which occurs is the provision of conversational services. In the IMS real<br>
time bearers are provided, which are not possible efficiently for voice services. For efficiently<br>
providing a speech service via GSM or WCDMA access, the circuit switched access is to be<br>
used.<br>
Summary and description of the invention<br>

switched multimedia services to user's equipment operating in circuit-switched controlled<br>

It should be noted that the term "entity", "node", "module", "logic" in the context of the present<br>
invention refers to any suitable combination of hardware and software for providing a<br>
predetermined functionality in the communication network. In this way, said terms generally<br>
refers to a logical entity that can be spread out over several physical entities, but can also<br>
refer to a physical entity located in one physical location, if no explicit definition is given.<br>
It should be noted that the term "user" in the context of the present invention refers to circuit-<br>
switched controlled user equipment, wherein said user equipment is a combination of<br>
hardware and software. However in the following description the terms "user" and "user<br>
terminal" should be seen as having the same meaning, if it is not stated differently.<br>
Preferably, the communication network is a mobile communication network, e.g. is a<br>
wireless communication network operating according to GSM, GPRS (General Packet<br>
Switched Radio) or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone System) or any 3G system like for<br>
example EDGE, CDMA2000. And preferably the packet-switched multimedia domain is the<br>
IP multimedia Subsystem (IMS).<br>
According to the present invention it is proposed, in order to allow IMS to take the full call<br>
and service control, to combine the logical functionality of a cellular switching center and the<br>
logical functionality of IMS in an Access Gateway Node, which is called in the following<br>
MAGCF. In particular it is proposed that this new MAGCF node comprises a serving circuit-<br>
switched functionality like for example MSC, or MSC-S being serving MSC for a roaming<br>
user, or a GMSC-S for terminating calls to a roaming user in a network without MAGCF<br>
functionality, and optionally gsmSCF for originating calls for a roaming user and further it is<br>
proposed that the MAGCF has packet-switched multimedia functionality which is in particular<br>
the proxy call control function, like for example the P-CSCF for forwarding SIP messages<br>
from the user to IMS and from IMS to the user. In general it might be said that the MAGCF<br>
handles in the packet-switched multimedia domain on behalf of the user with a circuited-<br>
switched terminal. Further it is proposed that the MGCF performs protocol conversion<br>
between cellular call control protocols and IMS protocols. The task of an integrated user<br>
agent is to fulfil the IMS functionality and to handle on behalf of the user.<br>
 <br>
The basic concept is to ensure that the MAGCF handles all originating and terminating calls<br>
or in other words, it is to be ensured that the MAGCF is the anchor point for the cellular<br>
access towards IMS.<br>
The present invention concentrates on establishing and handling of user calls. However,<br>
before establishing a packet-switched multimedia session, the user needs to perform<br>
registration procedure in order to let the circuited-switched and the IMS domain know the<br>
location of said user. This registration is performed by means of the SIP protocol and the<br>
user agent being part of the MAGCF and handling on behalf of the user performs the<br>
registration.<br>
In the following registration with MAGCF as an anchor point is described. For example an<br>
embodiment is given describing changing of a service MSC-S while roaming to a visited<br>
network. When roaming into a visited network without support for MAGCF, the last<br>
responsible MAGCF is kept as anchor point.<br>
According to the present invention said MAGCF node has the MSC functionality, like MSC-S<br>
and the IMS functionality in form of user agent UA and an integrated P-CSCF. The MAGCF<br>
has therefore the capability to communicate with the HLR and with the IMS and at least one<br>
MAGCF is foreseen for a user in a home network. Usually in a network a number of MSCs is<br>
provided, wherein a MSC is responsible for users being located in location areas being<br>
assigned to the MSC. Changing of the responsible MSC due to user's movement implies<br>
initiation of the roaming procedure aiming to register the user in a new MSC and de-register<br>
from the old MSC by performing all the necessary updates in respect therewith in the<br>
corresponding nodes. After entering a new location area, the terminal sends a location<br>
update request to the new MSC. When receiving this message, the MSC identifies the<br>
subscriber to be new in its responsibility and therefore the HLR is contacted for updating the<br>
location information. Upon receiving the location update message the HLR informs the old<br>
MSC that the subscriber has roamed into a new MSC area. According to the present<br>
invention a user serving MSC might be either part of a MAGCF or in case a user roams in a<br>
visited network it might be a usual MSC located in said visited network and communicating<br>
with the circuited-switched part of the MAGCF. In both cases a message is sent from the<br>
HLR that the MSC does no longer serve the subscriber. In case a MSC is a part of MAGCF<br>
in this case the new MAGCF is assigned to the user, which results in changing the address<br>
of the serving MAGCF in the S-CSCF and it results also in storing an address of the S-CSCF<br>
 <br>
in the MAGCF. In case the serving MSC is not a part of the MAGCF, for example it might<br>
occur when a user roams in a visited network, in this case the serving MSC might change<br>
but the MAGCF remains the same. In order to register to the IMS system, the HLR, when<br>
receiving a location update, checks whether the MSC is a part of a MAGCF or not. Further<br>
the HLR checks the requesting subscriber. In order to provide the IMS functionality to the<br>
users, said users has to be ported to the IMS system. In other words, the user has to either<br>
announce actively the change to the IMS system or the system might decide to port cellular<br>
users to the IMS system. A corresponding notification about the user is to be stated in the<br>
HLR. In case a user is not ported, it is proposed to apply the standard behaviour for a<br>
cellular user like it is already known. In case the user is ported to the IMS, it is proposed that<br>
the HLR sends all the parameters, which are usually stored at the SIM card in the user's<br>
equipment to the MAGCF. Upon receipt of the parameters the user agent is contacted in<br>
order to register and to subscribe the subscriber in the IMS system. Preferably the applied<br>
protocol for the registration and for the subscription purpose is the SIP protocol, in this case<br>
also the user agent has SIP functionality implemented. During the IMS registration, the user<br>
agent acts on behalf of the subscriber. All steps necessary for registration are performed by<br>
the means of the IMS entities integrated in the MAGCF. The steps might include for example<br>
authentication of the user which is to be authenticate. However it is to be stated that the<br>
authentication is not mandatory because the solution might rely on the fact that the user has<br>
already been authenticated as part of the circuit-switched access and further it might be<br>
assumed that the MAGCF is connected to a trusted VPN. The result of the registration is that<br>
the MAGCF stores the S-CSCF address and following the IMS rules for registration, the S-<br>
CSCF stores the MAGCF address where the registered subscriber can be reached,<br>
preferably the P-CSCF address as integrated in the MAGCF is stored.<br>
If a user roams in a visited network without MAGCF functionality then in case of roaming to a<br>
MSC, it is proposed that the current MAGCF stays responsible for the user. In case no<br>
MAGCF is assigned to the user yet then it is proposed to take a default MAGCF. Thus the<br>
location update procedure is restricted to updating an MSC in the HLR but not the<br>
responsible MAGCF as long as the user stays in the visited network.<br>
After the registration is finished, a session establishment procedure including IMS Call setup<br>
procedure is initiated.<br>
 <br>
Thus, after a successful registration the MAGCF knows the S-CSCF and the S-CSCF has<br>
the MAGCF address, in particular the P-CSCF which functionality is part of the proposed<br>
MAGCF.<br>
In the following a procedure is described according to the present invention how to enforce<br>
that the call handling is performed by a serving MAGCF. This situation might occur for<br>
example when roaming in a remote visited network, where no MAGCF functionality is<br>
available. In this case it is proposed to use the last serving MAGCF as roaming anchor.<br>
The call handling procedure is described according to Fig.1 presenting schematically a<br>
structure of a MAGCF being a anchor point between a circuited-switched CS network with a<br>
user's circuited-switched control terminal MS and a packet-switched multimedia network PS.<br>
There is an originating circuit-switched logic, Org CS, adapted to receive an originating<br>
circuit-switched call. Said call might be received directly from the circuit-switched controlled<br>
user's terminal in case the serving MSC is part of the MAGCF. This situation occurs when a<br>
user is in home network and it is defined that the serving MSC is included in the MAGCF.<br>
Alternatively the MAGCF might receive an originating call from a serving mobile circuit-<br>
switched function, which might be for example a MSC/VLR in a visited network handling the<br>
user. In this case the calling user contacts the MSC/VLR in a well known manner, using for<br>
example the B-number, and according to the present invention the MSC/VLR has to route<br>
the call to the MAGCF being responsible for the user. This is ensured by means of assigning<br>
a routing number. In the further description two methods for assigning a routing number are<br>
given; one is based on a roaming number assigned to a call and identifying in a unique<br>
manner the MAGCF, where the call is to be routed. For the purpose of assigning a number<br>
Intelligent Network IN-Functions are applied. In a second method the B-number is enhanced<br>
with a prefix, which defines how to route a B-number to the MAGCF. As it is also described<br>
in accordance with the both methods the routing number is assigned according to an<br>
indication about the Access Gateway Node serving the user received from a user's directory,<br>
like for example the HLR.<br>
Independent whether the originating CS call is received directly from the user's terminal or<br>
via a MSC/VLR, in the next step the MAGCF converts the originating CS call in the<br>
conversion unit, Conv, into an originating packet-based multimedia call which is past to an<br>
originating packet-based multimedia logic Orig PS adapted to send the originating packet-<br>
based multimedia call towards the packet-based multimedia domain. According to the<br>
present invention it is proposed to have a proxy call control function P-CSCF being part of<br>
 <br>
the Access Gateway Node. The Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is the first contact point in a IMS<br>
network, it forwards a SIP messages received from the user to S-CSCF which name the P-<br>
CSCF has received as a result of the registration procedure. In the opposite direction it<br>
forwards the SIP request or response to the UE. Said P-CSCF is also used to reach the<br>
MAGCF for the call termination. Thus a terminating packet-based multimedia logic, Term<br>
PS, is proposed which is adapted to receive from the packet-based multimedia domain a<br>
terminating packet-based multimedia call. Said call is routed to the MAGCF by means of the<br>
address of the proxy call control function, P-CSGF. Said call is converted to a terminating<br>
circuit-switched call in conversion function, Conv, and sent towards the circuit-switched<br>
controlled user's terminal by means of a terminating circuit-switched logic, Term CS. The<br>
termination call might be either sent directly to the circuit-switched controlled user's terminal<br>
in case a serving circuit-switched node is part of the circuit-switched function or it is to be<br>
routed to the sen/ing circuit-switched node in case said serving circuit-switched node is not a<br>
part of the circuit-switched function.<br>
Further it is proposed that the MAGCF has a suppression function adapted to suppress the<br>
received originating circuited-switched call from handling in the circuit-switched domain. This<br>
ensures that the originating call is really handled in the IMS domain. In order to deliver the<br>
circuited-switched call to the user it is to be ensured that the received terminating packet-<br>
based multimedia call is terminated in the MAGCF.<br>
In the following a method according to the present invention is described in respect to Fig. 2<br>
and Fig.3. Fig.2 presents a call originating case. In the first step 21 the MAGCF receives an<br>
originating circuit-switched call. Said call might be either received directly from the circuit-<br>
switched controlled user's terminal, in case a serving mobile circuit-switched function, MSC,<br>
is integrated in the MAGCF. In case the user is handled by a separate serving mobile circuit-<br>
switched function, then the call is to be routed to the serving MAGCF by means of a routing<br>
number. The assignment of the routing number is described further. In step 22 the circuited-<br>
switched call is converted into an originating packet-based multimedia call and sent in step<br>
23 towards the packet-based multimedia domain, 24. In the packet-switched multimedia part<br>
the proxy call control function P-CSCF is involved in the forwarding of the call.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment for call termination. In step 31 a terminating packet-based<br>
multimedia call is received from the packet-based multimedia domain. The routing of the call<br>
is performed by means of a proxy call control function P-CSCF. In step 32 the call is<br>
 <br>
converted into a terminating circuit-switched call and sent towards the circuit-switched<br>
controlled user's terminal, as described above either directly or via a serving MSC/VLR.<br>
In the following embodiments of the present inventions are given.<br>
In the following an embodiment is described showing an assignment of a routing number in<br>
case a user roams in a visited network and is served by a MSC/VLR being not a part of a<br>
serving MAGCF. In order to route all originating calls from the serving MSC/VLR to the<br>
roaming anchor MAGCF, a CAMEL mechanism as an example is used. The CAMEL<br>
approach is taken as an example and it has no restriction to the present invention.<br>
In the following some essential features of a CAMEL network being used in one embodiment<br>
of the present invention are mentioned. CAMEL is a network feature which allows the<br>
network operator to provide the mobile subscribers with the operator specific services even<br>
when mobile subscribers are roaming outside the home network. According to CAMEL<br>
architecture, CAMEL Service Control Functionality (gsmSCF) functionality is to be provided<br>
in the subscriber's home PLMN, which contains the CAMEL service logic needed to<br>
implement operator specific services. Further there is also CAMEL Service Switching<br>
Functionality (gsmSSF) taking part in the transaction handling and executing the instructions<br>
given from the gsmSCF. Often used protocol for communication between nodes in the<br>
CAMEL architecture is the CAMEL Application Part (CAP) protocol. In the frame of CAMEL,<br>
a so called Trigger Detection Point (TDP) is defined, which specifies a point of time in<br>
transaction handling when the gsmSCF shall be contacted. When the TDP is met the<br>
gsmSSF opens a dialog to gsmSCF. There are a number of functionalities defined for the<br>
gsmSCF, among other things; the gsmSCF can be provided with information about ongoing<br>
transaction, like for example destination address and duration of transaction.<br>
Returning to the embodiment of the present invention for ensuring that all calls are handled<br>
by a serving MIAGCF, in the following two possible approaches for this purpose are<br>
presented. In the first solution a roaming number is used that is dynamically assigned to the<br>
call for routing from the serving MSC/VLR to the serving MAGCF, the second modifies the<br>
actually dialed B-number by adding a prefix to it.<br>
The first approach is based on the concept of using a temporary roaming number. This<br>
solution is described in respect to Fig.4.<br>
 <br>
In Fig.4 a MSC/VLR is presented, which serves a user being located in its serving area,<br>
which is A visiting network. According to the present invention the MSC/VLR communicates<br>
with the MAGCF being located in the home network, A home, and comprising also gsmSCF<br>
functionality. Thus, the MAGCF provides connectivity to the circuit-switched domain. On the<br>
other hand the MAGCF provides signalling communication to the IMS and in particular to the<br>
S-CSCF. The S-CSCF is the user serving node in the IMS domain. It acts as a call server<br>
and handles call signalling. Further, according to Fig.4 there is also the IMS AS which hosts<br>
and executes services, the user requested for. The AS is for example responsible for the call<br>
flows and user interface interactions with subscribers. The IMS AS delivers services to the<br>
IMS, such as push-to-talk, ringback tones, prepaid calling card, multimedia conferencing and<br>
multimedia messaging service logic. Further there is also a HLR being a user database<br>
located in the circuit-switched network.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention it is proposed to perform the<br>
transmission of user plane and of the user signalling on two independent layers. In the user<br>
plane, interworking elements are required to convert IP based media streams accordingly.<br>
The Media Gateway (MGW) node is responsible for this function. The Multimedia Resource<br>
Function Processor (MRFP) provides adjunct media processing for the application layer<br>
such as audio mixing, content recording and playback, codec transcoding, statistic obtaining<br>
and is connected to the MGW. The MRFP is not dedicated to a single application but<br>
provides media processing as a shared resource to a multitude of applications. The Media<br>
Resource Function Controller (MRFC) provides a media resource broker function between<br>
the AS and MRFP resources in the IMS, and can be implemented as part of an application<br>
server or as a separate network element.<br>
According to Fig.4 the flow of signaling information is depicted by means of a dotted line and<br>
the continuous line represent the flow of user plane.<br>
In respect to Fig.4 the following steps are proposed in order to deliver the call handling to the<br>
MAGCF.<br>
When a user moves to a visited network, at first a location update procedure is to be<br>
performed in order to inform the HLR about the new location of the user. The communication<br>
between the MSC/VLR and HLR is realised by means of a MAP protocol. Thus, the HLR<br>
receives a MAP message for Update Location, the HLR determines whether the sending<br>
node supports MAGCF functionality. This can be achieved by including an indication from<br>
 <br>
the sending node that MAGCF functionality is supported. Alternatively, the HLR can check in<br>
a predefined list administered in the HLR. If the HLR determines that MAGCF function is not<br>
supported by the node sending Update Location, it is proposed that the HLR adds CAMEL<br>
data to the data sent via MAP operation Insert Subscriber Data. This CAMEL data arms the<br>
CAMEL Trigger Detection Point for "Collect_info", which indicates to the MSC/VLR to<br>
establish a connection to the gsmSCF, being responsible for the handling of user's call in the<br>
home network. As the address of the gsmSCF to be contacted, the HLR includes the<br>
address of the currently serving MAGCF, step 41. In case there is no serving MAGCF known<br>
in HLR, the HLR can use a predefined default MAGCF. As a result of the location procedure,<br>
the MSC/VLR has the contact address of MAGCF. In step 42 the MSC/VLR receives a call<br>
setup request including the called B-number. The CAMEL Trigger Detection Point<br>
"Collectjnfo" is triggered immediately upon reception of the call request, which results that<br>
the MSC/VLR halts call setup processing and contacts the gsmSCF as addressed by the<br>
CAMEL subscription data received from HLR. The CAP message InitialDP is sent to the<br>
gsmSCF including the B-number. Since the HLR provided the address of the serving<br>
MAGCF as gsmSCF address, actually the MAGCF is contacted, step 43. In the subsequent<br>
step 44, the MAGCF allocates a temporary roaming number to be used to route calls to this<br>
MAGCF. The MAGCF stores the received B-number, so that it can later match the incoming<br>
roaming number call to the right B-number. In step 45 the MAGCF instructs the MSC/VLR to<br>
route the originating call to that roaming number. The CAP message Connect is sent from<br>
MAGCF to MSC/VLR. By means of the received roaming number, the serving MSC/VLR<br>
routes the hold call to the MAGCF, step 46. In step 47 the MAGCF receives the call, coming<br>
in with the roaming number. The MAGCF then looks up the originally dialed B-number,<br>
which was stored when allocating the roaming number. The B-number as called destination<br>
is used in step 48 to route the call to the S-CSCF being responsible for serving the A-<br>
subscriber for execution of originating services.<br>
Thus, the described approach ensures that an originating call initiated in a visited network is<br>
forwarded to the MAGCF in order to be handled in the IMS domain. The call handling is<br>
described further.<br>
In the following a second approach is presented for routing all originating calls to the<br>
MAGCF node being the roaming anchor point. The solution is based on the concept of using<br>
a prefix to the B-number and described in respect to Fig.5. Fig.5 comprises all nodes as<br>
disclosed in respect to Fig.4 with the difference that the gsmSCF is depicted as a separate<br>
node. However this should not be seen as any restriction for the protection scope of the<br>
 <br>
present invention. According to the present embodiment the gsmSCF is to be used as a<br>
database to add a specific prefix to the B-number, wherein the prefix needs to be specific for<br>
the selected MAGCF and preferably different prefixes are used for different selected MAGCF<br>
nodes. Thus, since the gsmSCF is a central point that adds the prefixes it is shown as a<br>
separate node, however the gsmSCF could be co-located with any other node. Returning to<br>
Fig.5 Similar as in the first approach in step 51, the HLR determines whether a node sending<br>
a location update, supports MAGCF functionality. This determination might be performed by<br>
any preferably method, as it is disclosed in the first approach. If the HLR determines that<br>
MAGCF function is not supported by the node sending Update Location, the HLR sends the<br>
CAMEL Trigger Detection Point for "Collect_info" with an indication, which MAGCF currently<br>
serves the user and an address of the serving gsmSCF, step 51. Alternatively no address of<br>
the serving gsmSCF is sent and in this case any gsmSCF in the home network can be<br>
contacted. As already mentioned, if there is no serving MAGCF known in HLR, the HLR can<br>
use a predefined default MAGCF. In step 52 a call setup request is received in the serving<br>
MSC/VLR carrying the called B-number. When receiving said request the CAMEL Trigger<br>
Detection Point "Collectjnfo" is triggered immediately, which leads that the MSC/VLR halts<br>
call setup processing and contacts the gsmSCF as addressed by the CAMEL subscription<br>
data received from HLR. The CAP message InitialDP is sent to the gsmSCF including the B-<br>
number and the indication of the serving MAGCF, step 53. The gsmSCF recognizes from the<br>
received indication, which MAGCF is currently serving the subscriber. Then the gsmSCF<br>
adds a prefix to the B-number, which is specific for that serving MAGCF. Preferably, the<br>
prefixes are predefined in the gsmSCF. The gsmSCF then returns this modified B-number to<br>
the MSC/VLR and requests to continue call setup to this new number. The CAP message<br>
Connect is sent in step 54 from gsmSCF to MSC/VLR for this purpose. By means of the<br>
received prefixed B-number, the serving MSC/VLR routes the call to the MAGCF, step 55.<br>
The MAGCF receives the call coming in with the prefixed B-number and removes the prefix.<br>
It is to be mentioned, that preferably also the A-number is to be provided by the MSC/VLR,<br>
in order to allow the MAGCF to identify the right served subscriber. In step 56, the call is<br>
routed to the S-CSCF of the A-subscriber for execution of originating services. Here the B-<br>
number is again used as called destination.<br>
Thus also the second approach ensures that all originating calls are provided to the MAGCF<br>
serving a user.<br>
In both approaches, when roaming in a network without support for MAGCF functionality, the<br>
last serving MAGCF is used as a roaming anchor. However, since the IMS AS is responsible<br>
 <br>
for handling all services, service execution in the MSC/VLR has to be suppressed.<br>
Preferably a mechanism to filter the subscriber data is proposed in order to prevent the<br>
MSC/VLR to handle any services. The HLR knows that a subscriber is roaming in a remote<br>
visited network. So when sending the MAP operation Insert Subscriber data, the HLR filters<br>
out all supplementary service subscriptions before sending the data to the MSC/VLR.<br>
Further it is proposed that when roaming in the home network, the subscriber data is not<br>
filtered and the MAGCF takes care to suppress the any service invocation. Another option is<br>
to filter the subscriber data also when sent in the home network to an MAGCF.<br>
In the following a basic architecture for performing the originating call in the home network is<br>
presented in respect to Fig.6. Fig.6 shows a user A being the call originating user. Said user<br>
is connected over a radio access network, like UTRAN or GERAN to the MAGCF. Since the<br>
user performs a call in the home network, it is directly connected to the MSC-S part of the<br>
MAGCF node. The IMS part of the MAGCF node conveys a connection to the S-CSCF by<br>
means of the SIP protocol. In particular the integrated P-CSCF knows the address of the S-<br>
CSCF. There is also the IMS AS node communicating with the S-CSCF.<br>
The dotted lines depict the flow of signalling messages. In Fig.6 also MGW and MRFP<br>
nodes are depicted, which are involved in the transmission of user plane being indicated by<br>
the continuous lines.<br>
According to Fig. 6 when the call request, step 61 is received in the MAGCF from the<br>
terminal, the MAGCF does not invoke any originating services and it also does not look at<br>
the received B-number. The MAGCF routes the call to the IMS of the served subscriber.<br>
Since the P-CSCF in the MAGCF still knows the S-CSCF from the IMS registration, the call<br>
is routed straight to the S-CSCF, step 62. In step 63, the S-CSCF involves the IMS AS for<br>
invoking originating services and analysis of the dialed B-number. The checking of the<br>
originating services might for example include barring of all outgoing calls supplementary<br>
services, which for example might be used when giving a phone to a third person then the<br>
barring service might be activated in order to prohibit said user from making a call while still<br>
allowing him to be reachable for all terminating calls.<br>
Further the MAGCF selects a MGW for handling the user plane. The IMS AS involves an<br>
MRFP for handling the user plane. MGW and MRFP are preferably separate nodes.<br>
 <br>
In the following the message flow sequence for an originating call in a Home network is<br>
described in respect to Fig.7. In Fig.7 a calling user UE A originating a call to the called user<br>
B: IMS are depicted. Since the user performs a call in a home network by contacting the<br>
MSC-S function integrated in the MAGCF node, therefore the MAGCF node with the MSC-S<br>
functionality is depicted. Further there is the A: S-CSCF, which is the serving S-CSCF for the<br>
originating user, the A: IMS AS being responsible for the user. The lines depicted between<br>
two entities indicate flow of the messages and the arrows the direction of the message<br>
exchange.<br>
In the first step of a call originating procedure the calling user, UE A sends a 24.0008: CS<br>
Service Request to the MAGCF, in particular to the MSC-S. Said node performs at first a<br>
circuit-switched authentication for the calling user as it is already known and in a subsequent<br>
step said user sends a 24.008: Setup message, which is confirmed by means of the 24.008:<br>
Call Proceeding message. As aforementioned the MAGCF knows the address of the S-<br>
CSCF being responsible for the user and therefore said address is taken to start the IMS<br>
Call setup procedure. In particular the integrated P-CSCF knows the address of the S-<br>
CSCF. In the first step SIP:lnvite is sent to the S-CSCF serving the calling user A. Said<br>
message includes as parameters the telephone number of the called user B, tel-URL and<br>
the Session Description Protocol Parameters of the user A SDP A. The SDP parameters are<br>
exchanged in the frame of SDP negotiation procedure between the communication entities,<br>
which are the originating and the terminating users. During the negotiation procedure media<br>
characteristics, like for example number of media flows or codecs, are negotiated.<br>
Returning to Fig.7 The A: S-CSCF sends a ISC:lnvite (Tel-URL, SDP A) to the A:IMS AS for<br>
invoking originating services and for analysing the dialled B-number. Upon receipt of an<br>
answer from the A:IMS AS, the A:S-CSCF sends a SIP:lnvite (SIP-URL, SDP A) message to<br>
the terminating user, B:IMS. In a subsequent step the SDP negotiation procedure is started<br>
by sending the SIP:183 Session Progress (SDP B) carrying the proposed SDP parameters<br>
from the terminating user. Said message is forwarded to the MAGCF, which after contacting<br>
the responsible RAN (Radio Access Network), in order to check whether the proposed SDP<br>
parameters are supported and in order to reserve the resources required for the negotiated<br>
session parameters. This is performed by means of the messages Assignment Request and<br>
Assignment Complete. In a following step the MAGCF sends a SIP:Update message<br>
through the A:S-CSCF to the B:IMS, which agrees on the new parameters by sending the<br>
SIP:200 OK (Update) message. In case, the called user is free and able to receive the call a<br>
corresponding indication, namely the SIP: 180 Ringing is sent to the MAGCF, which<br>
 <br>
translates it into circuit-switched protocol besed message, namely 24.008:Alerting. After<br>
receiving the SIP:200OK (Invite) message from the called user, B:IMS a 24.008: Connect<br>
message is sent to the originating user, UE A in order to finalize the establishment<br>
procedure. A confirmation of a successful performed call setup procedure is sent to the<br>
terminating user by means of the 24.008: Connect Ack and SIPAck messages. After<br>
successful performed call setup procedure a voice call might be carried out.<br>
In the following an embodiment is presented for performing an originating call in a remote<br>
visited network without support for MAGCF functionality. In this scenario, for a user roaming<br>
in this network, the last serving MAGCF is used as a roaming anchor point. As described in<br>
the previous embodiment, the HLR adds CAMEL data to the subscriber data when inserting<br>
subscriber data into the MSC/VLR, in order to enforce that the call handling is performed in<br>
the anchor MAGCF. Thus, when a call request is received, the MSC/VLR notices the<br>
CAMEL data, which causes the call to be routed to the roaming anchor MAGCF. After the<br>
call has reached the MAGCF, call setup continues as for the home network case, i.e. the call<br>
is forwarded to the S-CSCF for execution of originating services.<br>
The originating call is presented in the following in more details in respect to Fig.9 presenting<br>
the flow of messages. The Fig.9 Corresponds to the Fig.7 with the difference that in Fig.9<br>
additionally the MSC/VLR located in the visited network is depicted. Further in Fig.9 the<br>
MAGCF is depicted with the gsmSCF functionality. However this should not be seen as<br>
restriction. Alternatively the gsmSCF might be provided as a separate node.<br>
In the first step the user UE sends a 24.0008:CM Service Request message to the<br>
MSC/VLR followed by a 24.008: Setup (B Number), which are confirmed by the message<br>
24.008: Call Processing . The receipt of the messages means for the MSC/VLR that the user<br>
wishes to establish a connection to the user with the B-Number. However during the<br>
registration procedure the MSC/VLR has received form the HLR a CAMEL message, as<br>
described in the previous embodiments, informing that the user is to be handled by the<br>
gsmSCF, Based on this information the MSC/VLR routes the call to the MAGCF over the<br>
gsmSCF. In the previous embodiment it is discussed how to route a call to a MAGCF. In this<br>
particular embodiment the routing by using a roaming number is shown. According to this<br>
approach the MSC/VLR has the address of the gsmSCF, which is also the address of the<br>
MAGCF. By means of this address the MAGCF is contacted, CAP: InitialDP(B-number).<br>
Upon receipt of this message the MAGCF performs a procedure for providing a routing<br>
number, which includes allocating of a roaming number and putting the allocated roaming<br>
 <br>
number in relation to the B-number. Said roaming number is sent to the MSC/VLR by means<br>
of the CAP:Connect (Roaming Number) message in order to route the call by means of the<br>
roaming number, ISUP:IAM (Roaming Number). The rest of the procedure is similar to the<br>
steps described in respect to Fig.7 leading to convey call originating procedure.<br>
In the following embodiments describing a terminating call in the home network in respect to<br>
Fig.10 is described. The structure of the Fig.10 corresponds to the structure of Fig. 6. In step<br>
101 the S-CSCF receives a call which is to be terminated at the user B. The S-SCCF<br>
involves the IMS AS for execution of terminating services, step 102 and 103. Herein the<br>
terminating subscriber's services are checked, in a similar way as for the originating case.<br>
For example the barring of all incoming call when roaming abroad might be activated. In this<br>
example IMS checks whether a user has a subscription to this service, and then in case said<br>
user roams abroad, the call is blocked.<br>
The S-CSCF knows the address of the serving MAGCF from the IMS registration, as it is<br>
described in the above embodiments. In particular the address of the integrated P-CSCF is<br>
known to the S-CSCF. By means of a SIP protocol the call is forwarded to the MAGCF, in<br>
particular to the proxy gateway, P-CSCF located in the MAGCF, 104. The MAGCF<br>
terminates the call towards the terminal, however, without invocation of any service. The<br>
termination means that the IMS call is terminated in the MAGCF and converted to a CS call<br>
which is then forwarded for example by means of a 24.0008 protocol to the B user over an<br>
Access Network, like for example UTRAN or GERAN, 105. The described call terminating<br>
routing is preferably restricted to the routing of signaling information. It is proposed that the<br>
payload information is routed on a direct way via MRFP and MGW to the Access Network,<br>
as it is depicted in Fig.6 by means of the continuous line.<br>
The flow of messages for call terminating procedure is presented in the following in respect<br>
to Fig.11. Fig.11 shows an IMS user, A:IMS wishing to be connected to the user B, UE B. In<br>
a first step the I-CSCF is contacted which is responsible within an operator's network for all<br>
connections destined to a subscriber of that network operator, or a roaming user currently<br>
located within that network operator's service area. The contacting is performed by means of<br>
SIP:lnvite (SIP URL, SDP A). Multiple l-CSCFs within an operator's network might be<br>
available. The main function performed by the I-CSCF is assigning a S-CSCF to a user<br>
performing SIP registration. According to the present invention the S-CSCF knows the<br>
address of the MAGCF and in particular of the P-CSCF integrated in the MAGCF and<br>
therefore the SIP:lnvite might be forwarded to the MAGCF. In respect to Fig.11 before<br>
 <br>
forwarding the message to the MAGCF, the B:IMS AS is contacted by means of the<br>
ISC:lnvite messages in order to terminate the IMS services. Upon receipt of the<br>
SIP:lnvite(SIP-URL, SDP A) the IMS call is terminated in the MAGCF and a circuited-<br>
switched handling is initiated, including sending the 24.008: Paging message to the called<br>
user, UE B, performing the circuited-switched authentication, and establishing a call to the<br>
UE B by means of the 24.008: Call Setup and 24.008:Call Confirmed messages. The rest of<br>
the procedure is similar to the procedure described in respect to Fig.7. This means that the<br>
IMS part located in the MAGCF, namely the P-CSCF sends a SIP: 183 Session Progress<br>
(SDP B) message to the A:IMS user with the proposed parameters. According to the Fig. 11<br>
an update of the parameters at both communicating sides is performed by means of the<br>
SIP:Update and SIP:200OK messages. Upon the parameters are assigned, a ringing signal<br>
occurs, 24.008: Alerting, SIP:180 Ringing, and a connecting procedure, 24.008: Connect,<br>
SIP:200OK(invite) with the confirmation messages, SIP:ACK and 24.008: Connect ACK is<br>
performed.<br>
Of course it might happen that the calling user is located in a visited network, B visited,<br>
without MAGCF functionality. This scenario is described in the following in respect to Fig. 12<br>
showing the terminating call for user B. In this case the IMS part of a call is to be terminated<br>
in a MAGCF being responsible for the user and acting as a roaming anchor. Thus, the<br>
terminating call is routed to the S-CSCF, 121, which then involves the IMS AS for execution<br>
of terminating services, 122 and 123. As already mentioned the S-CSCF knows the address<br>
of the serving MAGCF from the IMS registration. Thus, the call is transmitted, preferably by<br>
means of the SIP protocol to the MAGCF, 124. Said MAGCF recognizes that it works as a<br>
roaming anchor, thus when the terminating call is received in the MAGCF, the MAGCF<br>
recognizes that it cannot terminate the call directly, but has to involve the serving MSC/VLR.<br>
So the MAGCF acts as a GMSC and asks the HLR for routing information. The HLR fetches<br>
the roaming number from the serving MSC/VLR, 126 and returns it to the MAGCF, 125. The<br>
call is then routed from the MAGCF to the MSC/VLR using the roaming number, 127. It is to<br>
be noted that no services are executed in the HLR, since for the execution of said services<br>
the IMS AS is responsible. The signaling sequence is similar to the sequence described in<br>
respect to Fig.11 with the difference that a corresponding signaling, preferably MAP based<br>
signaling is to be exchanged between the MAGCF, HLR and MSC/VLR, wherein said<br>
MSC/VLR is responsible for establishing a connection to the user B.<br>
The above-described embodiments are based on integration of cellular-switched controlled<br>
users equipment, like it is provided in GSM or GPRS, into IMS services developed in<br>
 <br>
connection with UMTS. However, the present invention is not only restricted to these<br>
networks. A further example might be CDMA2000 providing corresponding nodes as the<br>
nodes existing in GPRS or UMTS.<br>

Converting the originating circuit-switched call into an originating<br>
packet-based multimedia call (22) and,<br>
Sending the originating packet-based multimedia call via an integrated<br>
proxy call control function being a contact point of the packet-based<br>
multimedia system and towards the packet-based multimedia domain<br>
(23) and,<br>
• Performing call terminating procedure comprising<br>
Receiving from the packet-based multimedia domain a terminating<br>
packet-based multimedia call being addressed to the integrated proxy<br>
call control function (30,31) and being a contact point of the packet-<br>
based multimedia system and,<br>
Converting the terminating packet-based multimedia call into a<br>
terminating circuit-switched call (32) and,<br>
Sending the terminating circuit-switched call towards the circuit-<br>
switched controlled user's terminal (33) via a serving circuit-switched<br>
node by means of a number being used to route the terminating<br>
circuit-switched call from the Access Gateway Node to the serving<br>
circuit-switched node.<br>
10.	Method according to claim 9 wherein the routing number is an address of a dialled<br>
user modified with routing information to route the call to the Access Gateway Node<br>
serving the user.<br>
11.	Method according to claim 9 wherein the routing number is a temporary roaming<br>
address assigned to the call for routing the call to the Access Gateway Node serving<br>
the user.<br>
 <br>
12.	Method according to claim 10 or 11 wherein the routing number is assigned<br>
according to an indication about the Access Gateway Node serving the user received<br>
from a user's directory located in the circuit-switched domain.<br>
13.	Method according to claim 9 wherein the received originating circuited-switched call<br>
is suppressed in the Access Gateway Node from handling in the circuit-switched<br>
domain.<br>
14.	Method according to claim 9 wherein to terminate the received terminating packet-<br>
based multimedia call is terminated in the Access Gateway Node.<br>
<br>
The present invention proposes a solution for providing IMS services to users having circuit-<br>
switched controlled terminals. In particular, it is proposed, in order to allow IMS to take the<br>
full call and service control, to combine circuit-switched and packet-based multimedia<br>
functionality in a new node type called Mobile Access Gateway Control Function (MAGCF).<br>
In particular the present invention provides a method for ensuring that the MAGCF node acts<br>
as a roaming anchor point in order to enforce the handling of originating and terminating<br>
calls in the IMS.</td>
