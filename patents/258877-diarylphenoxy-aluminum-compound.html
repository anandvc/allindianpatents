Diarylphenoxy aluminum compounds Description<br>
Technical field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds which are obtainable by reacting a bis(diarylphenol) ligand of the formula (I)<br><br>
with an alkylaluminum compound and/or a complex aluminum hydride.<br>
The invention moreover relates to the use of such diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds as catalysts.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method of producing isopulegol and diastereomer mixtures of isopulegol by cyclization of citronellal in the presence of diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds as catalysts.<br>
In terms of amount, menthol is the most important aroma chemical worldwide. The demand for menthol continues to be covered largely by isolation from natural sources. In addition, however, there are also synthetic routes to menthol, sometimes in racemic form, sometimes in the form of the natural enantiomer L-menthol.<br>
An important intermediate for the production of racemic and optically active menthol is isopulegol, which is usually produced by cyclizing oxo-ene reaction of citronellal in the presence of Lewis-acidic catalysts and is usually produced in the form of mixtures of the four diastereomers isopulegol, iso-isopulegol, neo-isopulegol and neoiso-<br>
isopulegol.<br>
Prior art:<br>
Suitable catalysts which have been described for carrying out the abovementioned cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol are both heterogeneous catalysts, such as Si02, Al203/Si02, Si02/Zr02, Si02/Ti02 mixed catalysts, rnordenites, fajausites,<br><br>
montmorillonites and zeolites - and also homogeneous catalysts, such as, for example, sulfonic acids or Lewis acids, such as, for example, SnCI4, ZnCI2 or ZnBr2.<br>
An industrially used catalyst for the cyclization of citronellal is zinc bromide. However, using this catalyst, only yields of about 87% and diastereoselectivities of 91 : 9 (ratio of isopulegol to the other isomers of isopulegol) are obtained.<br>
EP-A 1 225 163 describes the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol in the presence of tris(2,6-diphenylphenol)aluminum catalysts. Tris(2,6-diphenylphenol)aluminum is known in the literature and described as catalyst for selective 1,4-functionalizations of a,p-unsaiurated carbony! compounds and for specific Claisen rearrangements, for example in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004, 43, 994.<br>
S. Saito et al. describe, in Synlett, 1, 57 - 58, an aluminum trisphenoxide polymer and its use as Lewis-acidic catalyst for carrying out Diels-Alder reactions of a,p-unsaturated aldehydes as dienophiles with dienes. The specified trisphenoxide polymer is obtained by reacting 4,4'-(2,6t2',6'-tetraphenyl)biphenol with trimethylaluminum in toluene with ultrasound treatment. By-products of the desired Diels-Alder adducts described are dimeric esters as a result of a downstream Tishchenko reaction.<br>
JP 9-278817 A relates to catalysts for olefin polymerization which are suitable as replacement for aluminoxanes. The catalysts comprise (a) a transition metal of groups 4 to 6 of the Periodic Table of the Elements which is bonded to a cyclopentadienyl system or two bridged cyclopentadienyl systems, (b) an aluminum alkyl and (c) an aromatic compound with at least two hydroxy groups bonded to the aromatic ring.<br>
Object of the invention:<br>
In the method, regarded as being the closest prior art, for the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol in the presence of tris(2,6-diphenylphenol)aluminum catalysts according to EP-A 1 225 163, the catalyst complexes used are expensive and can only be manufactured in a complex manner. A disadvantage of the described method, which is to be carried out in a homogeneous phase, is that recovery of the catalyst complexes used is not possible since the catalyst complex is hydrolyzed after the reaction is complete. Also, possible recovery and reusability of the ligand released in the process is not described.<br>
Accordingly, it was an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst system which catalyzes the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol at least as well as known catalyst systems and which either, when the reaction is complete, can be recovered in a technically simple manner and also in high purity and yield and reused, or its ligands<br><br>
can, after the reaction has taken place, be recovered in a technically simple way and also in high purity and yield and reused.<br>

The ligands of the formula (la) likewise have two phenol systems which are in each case substituted in the two ortho positions relative to the phenolic hydroxy group by aromatics or heteroaromatics (Ar1 to Ar4) and are joined together via a structural element A and, if appropriate, can also carry further substituents (R1 to R4), where the structural element A is joined to the two phenol systems in each case in the para position relative to the phenolic hydroxy group.

The bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) which can be used for producing the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention can be prepared easily by methods known per se to the person skilled in the art. Compounds of structure type a1 are obtainable, for example, by reacting the corresponding bis-ortho-arylphenols with an aldehyde R15CHO in the presence of a Lewis acid, for example AICI3, as described, inter alia, by Z.Y. Wang, A.S. Hay in Synthesis 1989, 471-472 or in US 3,739,035. Ligands of structure type (la2) are, for example, accessible by reacting the corresponding bis-ortho-arylphenols with a suitable ketone of the formula R16C(0)R17, as described, for example, in US 3,739,035. Ligands of structure type (la3) are accessible, for example, by Friedel-Crafts acylation of the corresponding phenols or O-protected phenols with dicarboxylic acid chlorides, as described, for example, by F.F. Blicke et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1938, 60, 2283-2285; CH 350461 or by G. Maier et al. in Chem. Ber. 1985, 118, 704-721. Another way of producing ligands of structure type (la3) also consists in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the corresponding phenols with tertiary diols, as described, for example, in DE-A 25 34 558, or with dihalides, as described, for example, by J. Zavada, in Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 1976, 41, 1777-1790.<br><br>
The diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are obtained, for example, by reacting the above-described bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (1) or (la) with an aluminum compound of the formula (II)<br><br>
Here, R14 is a branched or unbranched alkyl radical having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, isopentyl or neopentyl. The index p is 0 or an integer from 1 to 3. Preferably, the index p is 1 or 0, particularly preferably 0. Preferred compounds of the formula (II) are, for example, trimethylaiuminum, triethylaluminum, diisobutyialuminum hydride, particularly preferably trimethylaiuminum and triethylaluminum.<br>
Alternatively to this, the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are also obtained by reacting the above-described bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) with an aluminum compound of the formula (III)<br><br>
where M is lithium, sodium or potassium. Consequently, of suitability for producing the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention by reacting the above-described bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) are also lithium aluminum hydride, sodium aluminum hydride and potassium aluminum hydride, and mixtures thereof. Moreover, mixtures of the specified compounds of the formulae (II) and (III) are also suitable for producing diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention by reaction with the above-described bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la).<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out such that one of the above-described bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) is brought into contact with a compound of the formula (II) or (III). The reaction is advantageously carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as, for example, toluene, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, ethyl acetate, pentane, hexane, dichloroethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the like, where the use of predried or anhydrous solvents is to be regarded as particularly advantageous. The reaction is usually carried out at temperatures in the range from about -100°C to about 100°C, preferably at about -50°C to about 50°C, particularly preferably at about -30°C to about 30°C.<br>
During the production of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention, the phenolic hydroxy groups of the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) used react with the compound or the compounds of the formulae (II) and (III).<br><br>
Theoretically, each aluminum atom can react with 1 to 3 phenolic hydroxy groups. On account of the steric properties or requirements of the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) used, this may result in the formation of higher molecular weight structures, such as linear structures or networks.<br>
Here, the molar ratio of the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) used to the compounds of the formula (II) and/or (III) used is advantageously chosen so that the amount of unreacted compounds of the formulae (II) and/or (III) is as low as possible. Preferably, the specified ratio is chosen so that, after the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) have been brought into contact with the compound or compounds of the formulae (II) and (III), unreacted compound of the formula (II) and/or (III) is no longer present. Taking the cost aspect into consideration, it is advisable to keep the excess of ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) used low. Particular preference is given to using bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) and the compounds of the formulae (II) and/or (III) in a molar ratio of from about 4:1 to about 1:1, very particularly preferably from about 3:1 to about 1.5:1 and most preferably in the molar ratio of about 1.5:1.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the production of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention involves initially introducing, depending on the solubility, an about 0.001 to about 1 molar solution of the selected ligand of the formula (I) or (la) in a suitable organic solvent, for example toluene, at a temperature of from about -10 to about 30°C, and adding an aluminum compound of the formula (II) and/or (111), preferably in the form of a solution, for example a solution of trimethyl- or triethylaluminum in toluene.<br>
The reaction between the ligands of the formula (I) or (la) used and the aluminum compounds of the formulae (II) and/or (III) usually takes place rapidly and is mostly complete after about 10 min to about 2 h, often after about 1 h, depending on the reaction conditions selected. When using lower-reactivity reactants, it may be advantageous to temporarily increase the temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
Depending on the reaction conditions selected, in particular with regard to the solubility of the ligands of the formula (I) or (la) to be reacted and of the aluminum compound of the formula (II) and/or (III) in the selected solvents, the concentrations, and the reaction temperatures, the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are obtained in the form of a solid, a suspension or a solution in the solvent or solvent mixture used. The diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention obtained in this way can be further used in the form obtained in each case or be separated off and freed from the solvents used.<br><br>
Isolation can take place here by methods which appear to be advantageous and are known to the person skilled in the art. Preferably, the isolation, storage and further treatment of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are carried out with extensive exclusion of oxygen and moisture.<br>
The diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are suitable to a particular degree as catalysts for carrying out chemical reactions, specifically reactions or conversions of organic compounds. Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention obtainable by reacting the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (ia) with the compounds of the formula.(I I) and/or (III) as catalysts. The diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are particularly suitable as catalysts for carrying out reactions which can be catalyzed by acids or Lewis acids. By way of example and without any limiting character, the following reaction types may be mentioned here: rearrangements, isomerizations, cyclizations, eliminations, dearomatizing nucleophilic functionalization of aromatic carbonyl compounds, conjugated addition onto a,|3-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, Diels-Alder reactions.<br>
The specified reactions are advantageously carried out under the dryest possible aprotic conditions and with the most extensive possible exclusion of oxygen.<br>
After the reaction has taken place, the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds used can be at least partially isolated from the reaction mixture using customary separation methods (e.g. by filtration, centrifugation) and then reused. Alternatively, however, the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (I) or (la) can also be readily recovered from the crude or already worked-up reaction mixture, if appropriate also after separating off reaction products and/or by-products, since they generally have advantageous physical properties such as, for example, good crystallization ability.<br>
The diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are suitable to a particular degree as catalysts for carrying out intramolecular reactions, in particular for carrying out cyclization reactions.<br>
According to the invention, particular preference is given to the use of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention as catalysts for the cyclization of racemic or nonracemic citronellal to racemic or nonracem ic isopulegol. In this connection, preference is given according to the invention in particular to the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds which are obtainable by reacting bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (la) with an aluminum com pound of the formula (I I) and/or (III). Very particular preference is given to the use of diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds which are obtainable by reacting bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formulae (lai) to (la3) as catalysts for the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegol.<br><br><br><br><br>
where the radicals Ar\ Ar2, Ar3, Ar4, R1, R2, R3, R4 and A have the meanings given above for form ula (la). Among these, preference is in turn given to the above-described ligands of the formulae (laO to (la3). Very particularly preferred ligands within the scope<br><br>
of the method according to the invention are the compounds la-,-1, la-^4 , lar5; la2-1, and la2-3.<br>
The diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention are obtained from said ligands, as described above, by reaction with an aluminum compound of the formula (II) and/or (III), preferably with an aluminum compound of the formula (II).<br>
To carry out the method according to the invention for producing isopulegol, the procedure advantageously involves firstly providing a solution of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds according to the invention in a suitable solvent as described above. According to the invention, the racemic or nonracemic citronellal to be cyclized is then added to this solution. The citronellal can be added here as it is or in the form of a solution, advantageously in one of the abovementioned suitable solvents. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, a solution of the selected ligand of the formulae (I) or (la) in toluene is firstly prepared and then, advantageously with stirring, the selected aluminum compound of the formula (II) and/or (III), preferably trimethylaluminum or triethylaluminum in toluenic solution is added.<br>
A suitable starting material for carrying out the cyclization method according to the invention is citronellal, which can be produced by any method. Preference is given to using citronellal which has a purity of from about 90 to about 99.9% by weight, particularly preferably from about 95 to about 99.9% by weight.<br>
The addition of the citronellal to be cyclized advantageously takes place at temperatures in the range from about - 40°C to about 40°C, preferably in the range from about -20°C to about 20°C. For this purpose, the prepared solution of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compound according to the invention is advantageously cooled to a temperature in this range, e.g. to a temperature in the range from -10°C to 10°C, and precooled citronellal or a precooled solution of citronellal is added.<br>
The citronellal or the solution thereof can be added in such a way that either the total amount is added in one portion or it is added to the prepared catalyst solution in portions or else continuously. Suitable solvents are in turn the abovementioned solvents, in particular toluene. Preferably, the citronellal to be cyclized is used as it is, i.e. without the further addition of solvents. If a solvent is used, the total amount of solvent (for catalyst production and for carrying out the cyclization reaction) is advantageously chosen so that the volume-based ratio of citronellal to be reacted to solvent is about 2:1 to about 1:20, preferably from about 1.5:1 to about 1:10.<br>
The quantitative ratio between the citronellal to be reacted and the amount of diarylphenoxyaluminum compound according to the invention used is determined by<br><br>
the amount of compounds of the formula (I) or (la) and of the formula (II) and/or (III) used for the production thereof, i.e. by the quantitative ratio of ligand used to aluminum compound of the formula (II) and/or (III) used.<br>
According to the invention, the amount of citronellal to be reacted relative to the amount of aluminum compound of the formula (I!) and/or (III) used is chosen such that the molar ratio is about 5:1 to about 1000:1, preferably about 10:1 to about 500:1, particularly preferably about 50:1 to about 200:1.<br>
Irrespective of this, the ratio between ligand of the formula (I) or (la) used and the aluminum compound of the formula (II) and/or (III) used can be varied within the limits specified above for producing the diarylphenoxyaluminum compound according to the invention.<br>
The cyclization according to the invention of citronellal to isopulegol generally takes place rapidly and is usually largely complete after about 0.5 to about 10 h, often after about 5 h, depending on the choice of reactants and reaction conditions. Reaction progress can be easily monitored by methods known per se to the person skilled in the art, for example by chromatographic, specifically gas-chromatographic methods, or else HPLC methods.<br>
Using certain citronellal grades (e.g. if citronellol impurities are present in the citronellal) during the production of isopulegol by cyclization of citronellal in the presence of the above-described diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds, it has sometimes been observed that, particularly in the case of reactions on an industrial scale, an undesired secondary reaction can take place to a troublesome extent: this is the formation of citronellyl citronellate of the formula (XII)<br><br>
or other high-boiling impurities, which cannot be accepted among the high requirements for yield, selectivity and stability to be placed on the abovementioned reaction of a method to be carried out on an industrial scale.<br>

Examples of organic acids which can be used advantageously are: acetic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, preferably acetic acid. The specified acids are advantageously used in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 10% by weight, based on the amount of<br><br>
citronellal to be reacted. They are advantageously added to the reaction mixture together with the citronellal, e.g. in the form of a mixture.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the method according to the invention for producing isopulegol by cyclization of citronellal is carried out in the presence of at least one compound which is selected from the group of carboxylic acid anhydrides, aldehydes, ketones and vinyl ethers.<br>
The compounds of said classes of substance can in each case be used individually or in the form of mixtures with one another. In the case of mixtures, preference is given to using those which consist of compounds from one class of substance. Particular preference is given to using individual compounds. Using the specified compounds, as described below, it is generally possible to largely suppress the formation of the undesired by-product of the formula (XII).<br>

Within the scope of a preferred embodiment, the cyclization method according to the invention is carried out in the presence of a carboxylic acid anhydride of the formula (VI), where the radicals R20 and R20 are identical and are a branched or unbranched Cr to C12-alkyl radical or C7- to C12-aralkyl radical or a C6- to Cio-aryl radical, and where R20 and R20 can together also form a 5- to 8-membered ring which can have one or more ethylenic double bonds and one or more identical or different hetero atoms selected from the group OR10e, SR10f, NR11b, and R10e, R10f and R11b, independently of one another, can have the meanings given above for R11.<br>

With regard to practical aspects, such as, for example, a higher reaction rate, the use of aldehydes and/or low-electron ketones has proven to be advantageous.<br><br>
The amount of carboxylic acid anhydride, aldehyde, ketone and/or vinyl ether to be used according to the invention can be varied within wide limits and is governed by the type of substance used and the degree of purity or the presence of impurities which are as yet not more precisely identified. Usually, the specified compounds and mixtures thereof are used in an amount of from about 0.01 mol% to about 5 mol%, preferably from about 0.1 mol% to about 2 mol%, based on the amount of citronellal used.<br>
The type and manner of the reaction procedure, for example the configuration of reactors or the order in which individual reactants are added, are not subject to particular requirements provided a reaction procedure with extensive exclusion of oxygen and water is ensured.<br>
To carry out the method according to the invention within the scope of this preferred embodiment, the procedure advantageously involves firstly providing a solution of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compound to be used according to the invention in a suitable solvent, as described above. Then, in accordance with the invention, a mixture of the racemic or nonracemic citronellal to be cyclized with the selected carboxylic acid anhydride, the aldehyde, the activated ketone and/or the vinyl ether is preferably added to this solution. Alternatively, it is possible, for example, to also admix the solution of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compound to be used according to the invention firstly with the carboxylic acid anhydride, the aldehyde, the ketone and/or the vinyl ether selected, if appropriate, in each case, and to afterwards add the citronellal to be cyclized.<br>
It has proven to be advantageous to meter in the citronellal or the mixture of citronellal with the selected compound to the catalyst solution or to the reaction mixture within a period of from about 30 min to about 6 h, preferably within about 2 h to about 4 h.

Suitable solvents are in turn preferably the abovementioned solvents, in particular toluene. Preference is given to using the citronellal to be cyclized in the form of a mixture with the selected carboxyiic acid anhydride, aldehyde, activated ketone and/or vinyl ether without the further addition of solvents. When using a solvent, the total amount of solvent is advantageously chosen so that the volume-based ratio of citronellal to be reacted relative to the solvent is about 1:1 to about 1:20, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:10.<br>
It has been found that some of the catalyst complex is usually deactivated during the reaction. This is to be attributed, inter alia, to ligand-exchange processes between the bis(diarylphenol) ligands of the formula used in each case of the diarylphenoxy-aluminum compounds used and the isopuiegol which forms as a result of cyclization. In contrast to the active polymeric catalyst, the deactivated form of the catalyst is usually soluble in the reaction mixture, depending on the choice of solvents used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, simple physical separation methods (e.g. filtration or centrifugation of the still-active catalyst) can be used to separate off the deactivated part of the catalyst together with the rest of the reaction mixture. The retained, still-active part of the catalyst can, if desired, be topped up with fresh catalyst and be reused with negligible loss in activity, preferably in the course of a further cyclization reaction according to the invention of citronellal to isopuiegol.<br>
Alternatively, the amount of catalyst used can be chosen so that the total catalyst complex used is deactivated in the course of the cyclization reaction according to the invention, or after completion of said reaction, and is thus soluble, which can be seen from a clear reaction mixture, in this connection, it is advantageously noticeable that in this case, on account of the above-described ligand-exchange processes, the bis-(diarylphenoxy) ligand of the formula (I) used in each case is released without having to carry out separate hydrolysis.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that, following distillative removal of the solvent used in each case, preferably of the toluene, and of the further compound used if appropriate, the cyclization product isopuiegol can be distilled off from the reaction mixture in high purities without prior hydrolysis of the diarylphenoxyaluminum compounds used in each case. In this connection, no recognizable undesired or troublesome by-products usually form in the distillation bottom either. Adding a suitable, inert high-boiling solvent, i.e. preferably a solvent which has a higher boiling point than isopuiegol, such as, for example, 1-methylnaphthalene, 1-decanol, tridecane, 1,2-propylenecarbonate, diethylene glycol dibutyl ether, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether and dibenzyl ether,<br><br>
before the distillation gives, in the distillation bottom, a solution of the free ligand in the hot high-boiiing component used in each case. The ligand can be crystallized out from this hot solution by simple cooling and be recovered in high purity by filtration. The bis-(diarylphenoxy) ligand recovered in this way can, usually without further purification steps, be reacted in the course of a new batch with the corresponding aluminum compounds of the formulae (II) or (111) to give the reactive catalyst complex, where, in the case of catalyst complexes recovered in this way, no or only negligible weakening of the reactivity is established. Moreover, further amounts of isopulegol and the bis-(diarylphenoxy) ligand used in each case can be obtained, following hydrolysis, from the mother liquor obtained as residue of the above-described. Within the scope of this preferred embodiment, the cyclization method according to the invention of citronellal to isopulegol correspondingly comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	distillative removal of the solvent used, if appropriate, and of the further compound used, if appropriate, (i.e. the carboxylic acid anhydride, aldehydes, ketones and/or vinyl ethers) from the product mixture obtained according to the method described above,<br>
b)	addition of a high-boiling solvent to the residue obtained in step a),<br>
c)	distillative separation of the isopulegol from the mixture obtained in step b) and<br>
d)	cooling of the distillation bottom obtained in step c) with crystallization of the bis(diarylphenol) ligand of the formula (I) used.<br>
After the desired reaction progress has been achieved, the cyclization reaction according to the invention can also be terminated in the usual manner, for example by adding an aqueous reagent, for example an aqueous alkaline solution, such as, for example, sodium or potassium hydroxide solution or, for example, also by adding water. The work-up and isolation can then be carried out in the manner known per se to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The additive used if appropriate, i.e. the carboxylic acid anhydride, ketone or aldehyde or vinyl ether used, can be recovered depending on its physical properties (e.g. the boiling point) e.g. by distillation from the fully reacted mixture extensively and to a degree in which it has not, if appropriate, even been reacted.<br>
In the course of the method according to the invention, isopulegol is usually obtained in the form of a mixture of the diastereomeric forms of isopulegol: isopulegol of the formula (XIII), neo-isopulegol of the formula (XIV), neoiso-isopulegol of the formula (XV) and iso-isopulegol of the formula (XVI).<br><br><br>
According to the invention, preference is given to embodiments of the method according to the invention in which a diastereomer mixture of isopulegol is produced which itself consists of at least about 85%, preferably of at least about 90% and particularly preferably of at least about 95% and very particularly preferably of at least about 98%, of the main diastereomer isopulegol of the formula (XII) or of the formula (IVa).<br>
The method according to the invention is equally suitable, as already mentioned, for cyclizing racemic and also nonracemic, i.e. optically active, citronellal to give racemic and nonracemic isopulegol. In a preferred embodiment, the method according to the invention serves for producing L-(-)-isopulegol by cyclization of D-(+)-citronellal.<br>
The racemic and nonracemic isopulegol produced in this way represents a valuable intermediate for producing racemic or nonracemic menthol, one of the most significant fragrances or aromas worldwide. Menthol can be obtained from isopulegol by methods of hydrogenation known per se to the person skilled in the art, especially catalytic hydrogenation over suitable transition metal catalysts, as described, for example, in Pickardet at, J. Chem. Soc. 1920, 1253; Ohloff etal., Chem. Ber. 1962, 95, 1400; Paviaet al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1981, 24, Otsuka et al., Synthesis 1991, 665 or in EP 1 053 974 A. Here, if the chosen reaction conditions are suitable, the relative or absolute configuration of the isopulegol used is largely retained, and in many cases is completely retained.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a method of producing racemic or nonracemic menthol starting from racemic or nonracemic isopulegol produced by the method described above and subsequent hydrogenation of its ethylenic double bond. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of producing L-(-)-menthol starting from L-(-)-isopulegol produced by the method described above by cyclization according to the invention of D-(+)-citronellal.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention without limiting it in any way:<br>
Gas-chromatographic analyses were carried out by the following method:<br>
30 m DB-WAX, ID.: 0.32 mm, FD.: 0.25 pm; 80 - 230°C, 3°C/min; Rf (citronellal): 10.5;<br>

Concentrations of the resulting reaction products in the reaction solution (in each case in % by weight) were ascertained by GC analysis using an internal standard. The additionally stated corresponding mass data (in each case in g) were extrapolated therefrom by calculation and can therefore have slight deviations. Diastereoselectivities were ascertained from the respective GC area% of the four diastereomers.<br>
