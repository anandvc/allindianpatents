FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of computer operating systems, and more particularly to sub-allocating disk space within logical blocks used by disk file systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disk based operating systems divide a disk into physical sectors which represent the fundamental units for data storage on the disk.  A sector is a portion of the circumference of a track on the disk, and each sector is represented logically as a data storage "block". Since a block represents the minimum logical storage unit for a disk, reading and writing data to a disk involves the use of entire blocks.  In general purpose disk file systems, block sizes are usually selected to be small (e.g., 512 bytes/block), in order to minimize the waste of disk space in blocks that are only partially filled with data. Such file systems also attempt to allocate the small blocks in sequential order on the disk, so that large reads and writes to the disk can be performed efficiently. However, as files are created, modified, or deleted, the free space on the disk.can quickly become fragmented so that new files are not allocated<br>
blocks which are sequential on the disk. One method of reducing file fragmentation is to increase the block size to accommodate larger files.<br>
The use of large block sizes, however, may introduce limitations which affect the disk access performance of the file system. Large block sizes increase the latency for disk transfers since a single read or write operation involves more data during a single operation. If each block is filled with data, single read or write operations may actually increase disk transfer efficiency/ since seek times are reduced. If, however, the blocks are not entirely filled with data or are filled with data which is to be accessed more than once by an application program, disk access cycles are wasted during read operations since entire blocks of disk space need to be read, or re-read, from disk into memory in order to access the data.  For blocks which contain a small amount of data in relation to the size of the block, data transfer latency can therefore be substantially increased.<br>
It is therefore an intended advantage of the present invention to provide a system for sub-allocating disk space within larger blocks so that data transfer operations are performed only on sections of blocks which contain data which has not previously been read into memory from the disk.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a method for sub-allocating space within blocks in a disk based file system so that read operations are performed only on sections of blocks which contain unaccessed data. Logical blocks are subdivided into a number of sub-blocks. A variable is assigned to each subÂ¬divided block, and is configured to maintain the status of each sub-block within the block. If a particular sub-block within the block contains data which has been read to disk, the variable is set to indicate that the sub-block has been accessed.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, an application program which performs a read operation from the disk locates the sub-block containing the data to be read. The variable for the block containing the sub-block is then checked to determine whether data within the sub-block has already been transferred from disk to memory. If the data is in memory, the file system returns a message to the application indicating that the read operation is complete. If the data is not in memory, the data is transferred from disk to memory and the variable is set to indicate that the sub-block has been read.    A method according to one embodiment of the present invention is particularly useful in systems in which disk caching is not used.<br>
Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A system for sub-allocating disk space within blocks defined within a file system is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.  It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate explanation. Hardware Overview<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of a computer which may be used to implement an embodiment of the present invention.   The computer system 100 includes a processor 102 coupled through a bus 101 to a random access memory (RAM) 104, a read only memory (ROM) 106, and display device 120. Keyboard 121 and cursor control unit 122 are coupled to bus 101 for communicating information and command selections to processor 102.   Also coupled to processor 102 through bus 101 is an input/output (I/O) interface 123 which can be used to control and transfer data to electronic devices connected to computer 100.<br>
Mass storage device 107 is also coupled to processor 102 through bus 101. Mass storage device 107 represents a memory device which stores data accessible from processor 102 through a block-based file system used by the computer system 100. Mass storage device 107 may be a persistent data storage device, such as a floppy disk drive or a fixed disk drive (e.g., magnetic, optical, magneto-optical, or the like) which can directly access locations on the disk for reading and writing data to and from the disk media.  Alternatively, mass storage device 107 could be a tape drive which accesses data sequentially on streaming tape media. It should be noted that the architecture of Figure 1 is<br>
provided only for purposes of illustration, and that a computer used in<br>
conjunction with the present invention is not limited to this specific<br>
architecture.<br><br>
Block Sub-Allocation<br>
Disk file systems organize data on disks in logical blocks which represent discrete fixed portions of memory on the disk. Any data stored in a block uses the entire block, even if the data does not completely fill the block. Thus, blocks represent the minimum storage unit on the disk.  Most disk file systems select block sizes to be small enough to minimize wasted disk space due to incompletely filled blocks. Small block sizes, however, cause large files to be fragmented among multiple blocks as files are deleted or modified blocks which are freed become occupied by other files. Allocating large block sizes alleviates some of the problems associated with file fragmentation, however, access to specific and small amounts of data within a large block causes increased disk input/output (I/O) cycles and wasted disk space.<br>
A method of one embodiment of the present invention lowers the I/O cycles required disk transfer operations by performing disk read operations only on areas of a file system block which contain data samples rather than on the whole block.  The system implements a single-sized block, and internally maintains a variable which records portions of the block have been read from disk into memory.    In one embodiment of the present invention, a read operation transfers data from disk to random access memory (RAM) coupled to the system processor (e.g., memory 104 in Figure 1). However, it should be noted that a read operation used in conjunction with the present invention may transfer data from disk to other types of memory devices or to input/output devices coupled to the processor.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a method of sub-allocating disk space within large blocks according to one embodiment of the present invention.  Block 200 represents a single block on a disk which is used by a file system. Block 200 is divided into a number of sub-blocks, denoted 1-N. Sub-block 202 represents the first sub-block, sub-block 204 represents the second sub-block, and sub-block 206 represents the Nth sub-block. Each sub-block of block 200 is of equal size, thus if block 200 is 32 kbytes, each sub-block is 1 kbyte.<br>
A scheduler process within the file system builds a list of references. Each reference contains an offset and a length which specify the location of data within a block. The offset is a pointer which points to a particular address location within the sub-block pointed to by the register; and the length specifies a number of sequential address locations from the offset address to the end of the data. The length delineates the end of a single file or data sample, and may specify an address in a block other than the block pointed to by the offset. As illustrated in Figure 2, reference 212 points to data in sub-block 202, reference 214 points to data in sub-block 204, and reference 216 points to data in sub-block 206. References thus point to data within a block, and each block may have several references depending on the amount of data in the block.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, a file system object, referred to as a "node", is associated with each block on the disk. A node contains a pointer to the block to which it is associated, as well as a node variable which specifies the location of data within the block. The node variable contains as many distinct states as there are sub-blocks within the block associated with the node. In Figure 2, node 220 represents the node associated with block 200. Node 220 contains a pointer 222 to block 200, and node variable 224.  Node variable 224 maintains the status of each sub-block<br>
within block 200 with respect to which sub-blocks have been read from disk into memory. Thus, if block 200 has been sub-divided into 32 sub-blocks, then variable 224 would be a 32-state variable.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, node variables are bit-mask type variables consisting of N-bits which assume either a T or '0' value. The number of bits, N, corresponds to the number of sub-blocks within the block. If a sub-block contains data which has been read from disk to memory, a bit corresponding to the location of the sub-block is set to a particular state. The bit could be set to either 0 or 1 to indicate that a sub-block has been read, depending on the default state of the node variable. Alternative embodiments are also contemplated.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the setting of a node corresponding to the location of data within a block. Block 300 is subdivided into 32 sub-blocks, 1-32 and is shown to contain three data samples which have been read into memory. The first sub-block 302 and third sub-block 306 have not been read; the second sub-block 304 and the fourth sub-block 308 each contain data which has been read; and sub-blocks 5-30 (not shown) have not been read. Likewise, the 31st sub-block 310 contains a data sample which has been read, and the 32nd sub-block 312 has not been read.<br>
Node variable 324 represents the variable within the node associated with block 300. Node variable 324 is a 32-bit variable with each bit location representing a corresponding sub-block in block 300. It is assumed that the<br>
default state of node variable 324 is all bits initially cleared (i.e., set to 0). Block 300 has data samples in the 2nd; 4th, and 31st sub-blocks which have been read into memory.   According to one embodiment of the present invention, bits within the variable are set in the order of the sub-blocks within the block. Therefore, node variable 324 has bits 2, 4, and 31 set to 1, and all other bits in the variable remain set to 0 since the corresponding sub-blocks have not been read into memory.<br>
The location of set bits within the node variable indicate to the file system which sub-blocks within the block have already been read. Therefore, if an application program using the file system required data from a particular sub-block, the file system would first check the status of the variable associated with the sub-block. If the bit for that particular sub-block was set, the file system would simply access memory to retrieve the data rather than perform a read of the sub-block. Thus, the use of sub-blocks and variables indicating the status of each sub-block within a block, prevents the need to read an entire block into memory to access a relatively small amount of data which may be stored in a particular location within the block.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of performing a read operation with a file system which implements a register and node structure according to the method for one embodiment of the present invention.  In step 402 logical blocks on the disk are each subdivided into a number of sub-blocks. A node variable is then assigned to each block to indicate which sub-blocks within the corresponding block contain data which has been read into memory, step 404.  In one embodiment of the present invention, the node variable is represented as a N-bit binary word, where N corresponds to the number of sub-blocks within a block.<br>
I/O cycles for data samples which are read more than once by the application program.<br>
Although the above discussion was written in the context of audio applications, it should be noted that a method of the present invention could be used in other similar applications, such as applications which involve both video and audio content, or applications which involve high-speed calculations on limited amounts of data.<br>
 Programming Example<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the block sub-allocator is used with a disk-based file system which is implemented as a C++ class. The following C++ program illustrates one method of implementing a block sub-allocator according to one embodiment of the present invention.   The following program code, is written in the context of an sound file for a digital player/recorder in which the disk file system allocates blocks of 32,768 samples.  When a sound needs to be played, the file system determines the offset and length into a particular block is required to be read. The file system then implements this read by subdividing the block into 32 blocks of 1024 samples each.  A 32-bit variable associated with the block indicates which parts of the block have been read.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The steps of a method of' the present invention may be implemented by a central processing unit (CPU) in a computer executing sequences of instructions stored in a memory. The memory may be a random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a persistent store, such as a mass storage device, or any combination of these devices.  Execution of the sequences of instructions causes the CPU to perform steps according to the present invention.  The instructions may be loaded into the memory of the computer from a storage device or from one or more other computer systems over a network connection.  Consequently, execution of the instructions may be performed directly by the CPU. In other cases, the instructions may not be directly executable by the CPU. Under these circumstances, the instructions may be executed by causing the CPU to execute an interpreter that interprets the instructions, or by causing the CPU to execute instructions which convert the received instructions to instructions which can be directly executed by the CPU. In other embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to implement the present invention.   Thus, the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the computer.<br>
In the foregoing, a system has been described for sub-allocating space within logical blocks on a disk to reduce wasted read cycles for blocks containing data which has already been read into memory.
