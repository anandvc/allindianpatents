NEW AQUEOUS REINFORCED RUBBER DISPERSIONS AND THEIR USE FOR MAKING LATEX FOAMS<br>
The present invention relates to new aqueous reinforced rubber dispersions, their use for malting latex foam, to a method for making a latex foam and to an article comprising a latex foam obtained from the inventive rubber dispersion.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Latex foam is prepared according to the prior art from aqueous highly concentrated rubber dispersions with the addition of sulfur crosslinking vulcanizing agents as. for example, described in DE-OS-2150872. It is often advantageous that mbber dispersions contain dispersions of a reinforcing material whereby the type and amount of this reinforcing component greatly influences the properties of the finished latex foam. In general latex foam is required to have high elasticity, in particular in the temperature range wherein the specific latex foam article will be used. Furthermore, this elasticity must not be lost, even during prolonged compression and especially in continuous use. This is of particular interest for latex foam articles, like mattresses and pillows. Accordingly the compression set in the temperature range of ordinary use should be as small as possible. Furthermore, in the past it has been considered as advantageous that the recovery of the compressed latex foam article should be as rapid as possible, i.e. the hysteresis should be as small as possible. Further requirements of a latex foam is a high tensile strength and a high elongation at break. Furthermore, at a predetermined hardness of the foam its density should be as low as possible in order to be able to produce the foam articles as economically as possible with regard to the amount of rubber dispersion which has to be used.<br>
GB-A-1 253 267 discloses a rubber dispersion comprising a base polymer latex of a 30/70 copolymer of styrene/butadiene and a reinforcing latex of a 70/30 copolymer of styrene/butadiene. From the experimental data It is evident that a styrene/butadiene ratio of 70/30 gives optimum results with respect to compression set and rebound properties. Reinforcing latices having a lower or<br><br>
In the recent past it has been discovered that high resilience of a latex foam, or in other words, low hysteresis values, are not desirable for all applications of latex foams. This is especially true for latex mattresses and pillows. High resilience means that after compression of, for example, a mattress it quickly returns after removal of the load into the original shape. Thus a high elastic force acts against the load compressing the mattress. Consequently a person lying on a mattress having high resilience or in other words a low hysteresis will experience a steady elastic force against the body that may lead to a compression of body tissue resulting in an impaired blood circulation. This will considerably reduce the sleeping comfort or may be even dangerous, especially for patients who are confined to bed.<br>
In case of a pillow made of a highly resilient polymer latex foam a resting or sleeping person will experience a steady force against the head and neck, resulting in discomfort and possible muscle distortions which are one of the main reasons for back ache.<br>
Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an aqueous rubber dispersion that results in latex foams having at a predetermined desired hardness a visco-elastic behavior, i.e. the elastic force and the recovery rate of the compressed foam is adjusted to avoid the above described disadvantages of highly resilient latex foams.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an aqueous polymer dispersion that results in a latex foam having at a predetermined desired hardness an acceptable relatively high hysteresis, as will be discussed below.<br>
Furthermore it would be advantageous to have a rubber dispersion resulting in a latex foam whereby the hysteresis can be easily adjusted while holding the hardness of the latex foam approximately constant.<br><br>
higher styrene content were considered as inappropriate with respect to the balance of these properties.<br>
Dispersions of single-phase reinforcing latices, as those described in GB-A-1 253 267 have already been considered in DE-OS-1056364 as being disadvantageous since they do not meet the requirements for low values for the compression set over a wide temperature range. According to the teaching of that reference better results are obtained by the use of multiphase graft copolymer dispersions which have a comparable overall composition and are prepared in a two-stage batch process. A further improvement of multiphase graft copolymer dispersions is described in EP-A-187905. The latex foams prepared from those rubber dispersions show particularly low values for the compression set in the total temperature range from 20-70°.<br>
EP-A-753530 considers the multiphase graft copolymer dispersions known from EP-A-187905 as disadvantageous since they have a poor resilience of the latex foams prepared from these dispersions which is evident from relatively high hysteresis values.<br>
In order to overcome this deficiency a reinforcing multiphase polymer having a distinguished core shell structure whereby the particles consist of 20-75 weight percent of a hard inner phase having a glass transition temperature above 70'C comprising 90-100 weight percent of aromatic monovinyl compounds and 10-0 weight percent of aliphatic conjugated dienes and 78-15 weight percent of a soft outer phase having a glass transition temperature below 20°C comprising 30-70 weight percent of aromatic monovinyl compounds and 70-30 weight percent of aliphatic conjugated dienes, and 2-10 weight percent of a transition region between these phases whose copolymer compositions are between those of the hard and of the soft phases is taught.<br>
From the experimental data in EP-A-753530 it is evident that latex foams prepared by using the multiphase reinforcing latex as described therein have a considerably lower hysteresis than the foams prepared by using the reinforcing latex described in EP-A-187905.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Contrary to the teaching of the prior art. as exemplified by EP-A-187905 and EP-A-753530 the reinforcing latex polymer particles to be used in the rubber dispersion according to the present invention do not contain two distinguishable polymer phases. Thus the reinforcing polymer latex particles according to the present invention form a single polymeric phase that does not have to be necessarily absolutely homogeneous with respect to the monomer distribution within the polymer particles. Thus a certain fluctuation in monomer distribution, for example, a gradient of monomer distribution along the radius of the polymer particles is encompassed in the present invention as long as no two distinct polymer phases are detectable.<br>
It is believed that these structural properties of the reinforcing latex polymer particles of the present invention are best described in that the inventive particles have a single glass transition temperature.<br>
According to the present invention the reinforcing latex polymer particles have a single glass transition temperature (Tg) from -25oC to 28oC, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Preferred upper limits of the Tg range according to the present invention are selected from 27oC,26oC, 25°C, 24oC, 23°C, 22oC, 2oC, 20oC19°C or 18oCas measured by DSC. Preferred ranges are from -20oC to 25oC, more prefen-ed from -15oCto 22°C, and most prefered from-15oC to 20°C.<br>
Furthermore, the aqueous reinforced rubber dispersion according to the present invention requires that the Tg as measured by DSC of the base latex polymer particles is lower than the Tg of the reinforcing latex particles. Preferable the difference between the Tg of the base latex polymer particles and the reinforcing latex particles is at least 25oC, preferably at least 30°C and most preferably at least 35°C. ATQ should be at most 79°C, preferably at most 75oC and most preferably at most 72oC.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
These objects have been surprisingly attained by an aqueous reinforced rubber dispersion comprising:<br>
a)	51 to 90 wt:-% of base latex polymer particles; and<br>
b)	10 to 49 wt-% of reinforcing latex polymer particles comprising structural units of aromatic vinyl monomers and conjugated diene monomers,<br>
the reinforcing latex polymer particles having a single glass transition temperature (Tg) from -25°C to 28'oC as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), whereby the weight percentages are based on the total weight of polymer particles in the rubber dispersion and the base latex polymer particles have a Tg as measured by DSC that is lower than the Tg of the reinforcing latex particles.<br>
Furthermore the present invention relates to the use of the above defined rubber dispersion for making latex foam.<br>
According to a further aspect the present invention relates to a method for making a latex foam by<br>
a)	compounding the rubber dispersion of the present invention into a foamable and vulcanizable latex compound;<br>
b)	foaming the vulcanizable latex compound;<br>
c)	filling the foam obtained in step b) into a mould of desired shape;<br>
d)	stabilizing the foam structure;<br>
e)	vulcanizing the foam; and<br>
f)	removing the vulcanized latex foam from the mould.<br>
The present invention according to a further aspect relates to an article comprising a latex foam obtained from a rubber dispersion according to the present invention.<br><br>
The single glass transition temperature of the reinforcing latex polymer particles of the present invention can advantageously be adjusted by preparing a reinforcing latex polymer comprising 45-68.5 weight percent structural units of aromatic vinyl monomers and 31.5-55 weight percent structural units of conjugated diene monomers. It is prefenred that the reinforcing latex polymer particles comprise 45-67 weight percent, more preferred 48-65 weight percent structural units of aromatic vinyl monomers and 33-55 weight percent, most preferred 35-42 weight percent structural units of conjugated diene monomers.<br>
The aromatic vinyl monomers for preparation of the reinforcing latex polymer particles are selected from styrene, a-methyl styrene, 4-methyl-styrene, a-chlor styrene, 4-chloro styrene, divinylbenzene, 4-methoxy-3-methylstyrene, 3,4-dimethyl-a-methylstyrene and combinations thereof. Preferably the aromatic vinyl monomer is styrene.<br>
The conjugated diene for the reinforcing latex polymer particles is preferably selected from 1,3-butadiene, 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene, isoprene, conjugated straight-chain and branched pentadienes and hexadienes, and combinations thereof. In view of availability and cost considerations 1,3-butadiene is most preferred.<br>
The reinforcing latex polymer according to the present invention can be prepared by standard emulsion polymerization methods in an aqueous phase as the dispersion medium, as known by the person sl^illed in the art.<br>
For the polymerization the required amount of monomers is preferably added in a feed process and emulsified in the aqueous phase by continuous vigorous stirring. Appropriate amounts of initiator and emulsifler are also added in a feed process in order to initiate the emulsion polymerization. Monomer and emulsifler can be added in the same manner also as an aqueous emulsion. Alternatively a part of the corresponding monomers can be initially introduced with a matched amount of initiator and emulsifier and can be polymerized in a batch reaction. The remaining amounts of monomers, emulsifier and initiator are then metered in thereafter into the feed. The amounts of initiator, emulsifler and monomer should be matched<br><br>
with one another in such a way that the weight average particle diameter of the reinforcing latex particle of the present invention as measured by the methods described below with respect to the particle size distribution of the reinforcing latex is 50 to 250 nm and preferably 130 to 160 nm.<br>
The reaction for the preparation of the reinforcing polymer latex of the present invention is carried out by suitable choice of the reaction temperature, reaction time and feed time in such a way that the monomer conversion at the end of this reaction is at least 95%. preferably more than 98 %, and most prefenred the conversion should be at least 99%.<br>
The reinforcing polymer latex is preferably stabilized using the customary fatty acid soaps and/or rosin soaps which lead to dispersions having increased pH values of between 8 and 12 depending on the alkalinity of these emuisifiers. The polymerization takes place at these pH values. The content of emulsifier is preferably between 0.5 and 10 weight percent, based on the total amount of monomers, more preferred between 2 and 6 weight percent.<br>
Advantageously 0.05-2 weight percent, based on the total amount of monomers of free radical initiators are used for the polymerization. All soluble and all water-soluble azo initiators, peroxides, hydroperoxides and peroxodisulfates are suitable for this purpose. In the polymerization at relatively high temperatures peroxodisulfates are preferably used. If on the other hand polymerization is effected at low temperatures peroxides and hydroperoxides in combination with a reducing agent are preferably used. Suitable reducing agents are, for example, sodium bisulfate, ascorbic acid and sodium formaldehyde suifoxilate, preferably also in combination with an iron-ll salt. Polymerization temperature is typically between zero and 90oC depending on the initiator system, preferably between 60 and 85°C when a peroxodisulfate is used as the initiator and preferably between 10 and 17°C when a redox Initiator system is used.<br>
Furthermore, chain transfer agents can be used for regulating the molecular weight and the degree of crosslinking. Particularly preferred are aliphatic straight-<br><br>
chain or branched mercaptanes in an amount of 0.1-2 weight percent, based on the total amount of the monomers.<br>
It is important for the present invention that the emulsion polymerization process for making the reinforcing latex polymer is canied out in such a way that the final latex particles resulting from the process constitute a single polymer phase having a single glass transition temperature. Although, as explained above, a certain fluctuation of monomer distribution throughout the polymer particle is acceptable any conditions should be avoided that result in polymer particles having distinct polymer phases, like for example, core shell structures or any other structures resulting in at least two distinguishable glass transition temperatures as measured by DSC methods.<br>
The soiids content of the reinforcing polymer latex of the present invention is preferably between 30 and 70 weight percent, more preferred between 40 and 60 weight percent.<br>
The aqueous reinforced rubber dispersions according to the present invention are prepared by mixing the base polymer latex and the reinforcing polymer latex of the present invention in relative amounts to result in 51-90 weight percent of base latex polymer particles and 10-49 weight percent of reinforcing latex polymer particles whereby the weight percentages are based on the total weight of polymer particles in the rubber dispersion. Preferably the rubber dispersion of the present invention comprises 55-85 weight percent, more prefen-ed 58-80 weight percent of the latex polymer particles and 15-45 weight percent, more preferred 20-42 weight percent of reinforcing latex polymer particles.<br>
After mixing the solid content of the aqueous rubber dispersion of the present invention is adjusted to be preferably at least 55 weight percent, more preferred at least 60 weight percent, most preferred at least 65 weight percent, based on the total weight of the dispersion, by evaporation of excess water.<br>
The base latex polymer according to the present invention is preferably selected from natural latex, synthetic styrene/butadiene rubber latex and combinations<br><br>
thereof, in case a styren ass transition temperature should be lower than the glass transition temperature of the reinforcing polymer latex as measured by DSC methods.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the base latex polymer is a styrene/butadiene mbber latex comprising 15-32 weight percent structural units of styrene and 68-85 weight percent structural units of 1,3-butadlene, preferably 20-30 weight percent, more preferred 22-30 weight percent structural units of styrene and 70-80 weight percent, more preferred 70-78 weight percent structural units of 1,3-butadiene, whereby the weight percentages are based on the total weight of styrene and 1,3-butadiene structural units.<br>
The aqueous reinforced rubber dispersion according to the present invention is preferably used for making a latex foam.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates also to a process for malting a latex foam by<br>
a)	compounding the rubber dispersion of the present invention into a foamable and vulcanlzable latex compound;<br>
b)	foaming the vulcanizable latex compound;<br>
c)	filling the foam obtained in step b) into a mould of desired shape;<br>
d)	stabilizing the foam structure;<br>
e)	vulcanizing the foam; and<br>
f)	removing the vulcanized latex foam from the mould.<br>
In order to compound the rubber dispersion of the present invention into a foamable and vulcanizable latex compound the dispersion is preferably mixed with emulsifiers, thickening agents and a vulcanizing paste as known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Emulsifiers are added to the rubber dispersion of the present invention in order to increase its mechanical and chemical stability and to facilitate foaming of the rubber dispersion. Anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactants can be chosen depending on the process requirements whereby anionic surfactants are preferred<br><br>
for foaming applications. Preferred anionic surfactants are fatty acid soaps, fatty alcohol sulfonates and all<ylaryl or aralkyi sulfonates succinates and amido sulfosuccinates. particularly preferred are alkali metal ammonium salts of fatty acids rosin combinations thereof most prefered thereof.></ylaryl>
The vulcanization paste, preferably employed in the foaming process of the present invention, comprises sulfur or sulfur compounds, zinc oxide, vulcanization accelerators and customary additives, like anti-aging agents or surfactants. Examples of suitable sulfur compounds are described in D.C. Blackley, High Polymer Latices, Vol. 1 1966, pages 69-72.<br>
Suitable vulcanization accelerators are described in D.C. Blackley, High Polymer Latices, Vol. 1 1966, pages 73-86, and in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 14, John Wiley &amp; Sons, pages 719-746 (1985).<br>
Suitable anti-aging agents are described in D.C. Blackley, High Polymer Latices, Vol. 1 1966, pages 86-89.<br>
The vulcanization pastes are suitably applied in amounts of 3-15 weight percent, preferably 4-12 weight percent, and most preferred 4-10 weight percent, based on the weight of the solids of the rubber dispersion.<br>
The thus obtained foamable and vulcanizable latex compound can be processed by any process known to the person skilled In the art for making foamed articles.<br>
Preferably the foamable and vulcanizable latex compound is processed by the Dunlop process or the Talalay process, whereby the Dunlop process is most prefen-ed.<br>
In case the foamed article is prepared according to the Dunlop process an appropriate amount of gelling agent is added to the readily mixed vulcanizable latex compound. The quantity of the gelling agent will depend on the desired pot life of the foamable compound which should be advantageously adjusted to be 5<br><br>
- 20 minutes. Preferably according to the Dunlop process an aqueous sodium silicofluoride dispersion is used as gelling agent. The compound can be first foamed and then the gelling agent is added and foaming is continued to obtain a homogeneous distribution of the gelling agent within the foam, the desired foam density, as well as the desired foam structure. Altematively, after the addition of the gelling agent the compound is foamed immediately using mechanical means in a way to prepare a stable foam of the desired foam density. Thereafter the foamed latex compound is filled into the mould of desired shape. Usually closed moulds are used but in some cases, for example shoe soles, open moulds can be employed.<br>
According to the Dunlop process the foam structure in the mould is stabilized by gelling the latex foam at elevated temperatures. Thereafter the moulds are heated, in case of close moulds preferably in saturated steam, to vulcanize the latex foam. After vulcanization the latex article is removed from the mould and if necessary washed and dried.<br>
Alternatively the Talalay process may be employed to prepare the latex foams according to the present invention. In the Talalay process the vulcanizable latex compound is first prefoamed to give a foam with relatively high density and then poured into the moulds. The closed moulds are then evacuated whereby the latex compound foams to the finally desired density due to the vacuum applied and thus fills the mould completely. By cooling the mould to approximately -30oC the foam structure is stabilized. Thereafter carbon dioxide is lead into the mould to pressurize the mould whereby at the same time the pH of the frozen foamed latex compound is lowered resulting in gelling. The foam then may be thawed without changing its structure and the mould is heated in stages up to 110°C to vulcanize the latex foam. After complete vulcanization the article is removed from the mould, optionally washed and dried.<br>
The foamed articles of the present invention may be used for mattresses, pillows, neck rests, toppers, shock absorbers, shaped parts of shoes, shoe inside soles, garments padding, protectors for sportswear, athletic implements, bike saddles.<br><br>
motorbike saddles, furniture upholstery material, bumpers and automotive dashboards.<br>
The latex foam of the present invention has preferably a hardness of less than 150 N, preferably less than 120 N, more preferred less than 100 N based on a dry foam density of 75 g/l measured at 23°C according to DIN EN ISO 2439, 2001-02 and a hysteresis of at least 50%, preferably at least 55%, more prefenred at least 60% as measured at a dry foam density of 75 g/l at 23°C according to DIN 53577.<br>

2.	Particle Size Distribution<br>
The particle size distribution is measured on the Particle Size Distribution Analyzer from PolymerLaboratories. The sample under investigation and a small molecule marker solution are introduced Into the system via a two position, electrically actuated valve, such that the eluentflow is not interrupted. The sample components are separated by an HDC mechanism in a "cartridge", and their concentration is measured by a UV detector. The system is calibrated using a series of particle size standards.<br>
3.	IHardness<br>
The hardness of the latex foam Is measured in accordance with DIN EN ISO 2439:2001/02, following the method according to process A - detennination of indentation hardness index.<br>

and the samples are conditioned for 16 h at 23oC in the measuring chamber.<br>
Reference Example 1: Reinforcing Latex having a ratio of structural units of stvrene to 1,3-butadien of 80/20:<br>
The reactor is charged with a solution of 1.75 g potassium oleate, 2.8 g sodium hydroxide and 0.350 g ammonium persulfate in 1225.0 g deionized water. The reactor is purged with nitrogen three times. The mixture is heated to 75 C and the temperature is kept constant Then a feeding of 0.42 g ammonium persulfate dissolved in 7.98 g deionized water is started.

Examples 1-5 and Comparative Examples 1-10.<br>
The reinforcing latices according to Reference Example 1 (Comparative Examples 1-5), of Reference Example 2 (Comparative Examples 6-10) and of Reference Example 3 (Examples 1-5) were mixed with a base latex in the relative amounts specified in Table 1 below in order to prepare aqueous reinforced rubber dispersions.<br>
As base latex a styrene/butadiene latex having the following characteristics was used (total solid content of about 67 %, pH of about 10.5, TQ of about - 50X.). The solid content of the thereby obtained aqueous reinforced rubber dispersions were adjusted to 63 weight percent based on the total weight of the dispersion by evaporation of excess water.<br>
389,6 g of each aqueous reinforced rubber dispersion were weighted together with 10.8 g potassium oleate as 17.5% aqueous solution, 24.5 g of sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose solution 2.5% in water (Blanose NA-CMC Type 12M<br><br>
31P available from Hercules GmbH) and 36.8 g of a 60% solid vulcanization paste Suprotex UGB, obtainable from Weserland Textilchemle, into the bowl of a Hobart Planetary Mixer (Type N50). In a separate vessel 23.1 g of 25% sodium silicofluoride dispersion in water was weiglited. The aqueous reinforced rubber dispersion in the mixing bowl was foamed using the Hobart Planetary Mixer until a wet foam density of about 112 g/l was achieved that corresponds to a dry foam density of about 75 g/l.<br>
Thereafter the sodium silicofluoride dispersion gelling agent was added and mixing was continued for 2 mln to achieve homogeneous distribution of the gelling agent within the foam and a homogeneous foam structure.<br>
The latex compound thus obtained from each composition according to the examples was filled into a 290mmx290mmx28mm mould. The mould was sealed and Its content vulcanized at 100°C with saturated steam for 20 min. The vulcanized foam was removed from the mould, washed and dried for 90 min at 120°C in a forced circulation oven.<br>
Thereafter the samples were conditioned and measured as indicated above with respect to the measuring methods. The actual foam density was measured for normalizing the hardness according to the above equation for a foam density of 75 g/dm3<br>
The results are given in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the experimental data in Table 1 the aqueous rubber dispersions according to the present invention lead to a latex foam having a desired hardness at a dry foam density of 75g/dm^ of around 100N which is well below the upper limit of 150N for the desired hardness. At the same time the vulcanized foams exhibit a hysteresis of between 54.7 and 84.9% which is also above the target lower limit of at least 50%. Consequently the latex foam obtained fulfills the hardness requirements and shows the desired visco-elastic properties.<br><br>
As can be seen from the Comparative Examples, although appropriate values can be obtained the hardness of these foams is well above the target value of less than 150N. Thus appropriate visco-elastic behavior can only be achieved with the comparative dispersion at unacceptable high harnesses.<br>
At high levels of the comparative reinforcing latices hardness and/or hysteresis are even not measurable.<br>
Moreover, it is evident from the experimental data that the hardness of the vulcanized latex foam of the present invention is virtually independent of the level of reinforcing latex whereas the hysteresis increases with increasing level of reinforcing latex, with the result that using the inventive polymer dispersion the visco-elastic properties can easily be adjusted at a given foam hardness by choosing an appropriate level of reinforcing latex.<br>
In contrast thereto using the comparative polymer dispersion the hardness increases with increasing levels of reinforcing latex, with the result that if the desired visco-elastic properties are adjusted by using a specific level of reinforcing latex unacceptable hardness of the foam will likewise be obtained resulting in a non-usable product.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
