THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT JS TO BE PERFORMED<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to Alternanthera bettzichiana extracts and processes for preparing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
AL TERNANTHERA BETTZICHIANA (REGEL)<br>
Phylum	-	Magnoliophyta<br>
Class	-	Magnoliopsida<br>
Order	-	Caryophyllales<br>
Family	-	Amaranthaceae<br>
Genus	-	Alternanthera<br>
There are about eighty varieties of genus Alternanthera Spread among tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The Ayurveda has already recognized Alternanthera pungens, Alternanthera sessilis, and Alternanthera philoxeroides as landmarks. About seven to eight species from this genus are located in Indian soil. Provided herein below are the species of the genus Alternanthera found in india: (Geeta C, et at. 1994.)<br>
1.	Alternanthera sessilis (L.) R. Br. ex DC.<br>
2.	Alternanthera pungens Kunth in H.B. &amp; K.<br>
3.	Alternanthera paronychioides St. Hil.<br>
4.	Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Gris.<br>
5.	Alternanthera tenella colla<br>
6.	Alternanthera bettzichiana (Regel) Nicolson<br>
7.	Alternanthera caracasana Kunth in H.B. &amp; K.<br>
Most of the species from the genus Alternanthera are considered as weeds and various species are utilized for the ornamental purpose. According to Janusz Lipecki, "A weed is defined to be a plant whose virtues have not been yet discovered and a plant in wrong place." This reflects negative nature of weeds (Janusz Lipecki, 2006). However, weeds also sometimes play positive role as natural components of the environment, for example Jimson weed {Datura stramonium).<br>
A. bettzichiana, a horticulture species, of many forms, is often found as an escape (Geeta C, et al.1994), reported as wild edible material (Arinathan V., et al. 2007) and as adsorbent for removal of Cr (VI) (Patil A.K., et al.2009).<br><br>
In order to make safe and sure use of the medicines, a necessary first step is the establishment of standards of safety and efficacy. Keeping this fact into consideration, in the present invention attempts are made to establish Pharmacognostical and pharmacological standards of the plant Altemanthera bettzichiana (Regel) Nicols which is a less exploited weed.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide Altemanthera bettzichiana extracts.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide processes for preparing the Altemanthera bettzichiana extract.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide processes for preparing the Altemanthera bettzichiana extract which are simple, high yielding and economic.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to perform physicochemical, phyto-chemical and pharmacological evaluation of Altemanthera bettzichiana.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the<br>
preparation of Alternanthera bettzichiana extract; said process comprising the following steps:<br>
First step is selecting the Alternanthera bettzichiana plant material.<br>
Fresh samples of the plant Alteanthera bettzichiana were collected from the different parts of<br>
Satpuda region of Chopda Tahsil, Jalgaon district in the month of September. The plant was<br>
authentificated from Botanical survey of India, Pune. Typically, the plant material used is wild<br>
plant material of A. bettzichiana or micro-propagated plant material of A. bettzichiana.<br>
The selected plant material is washed and cleaned properly.<br>
Second step is drying the cleaned Alternanthera bettzichiana plant material in shade.<br>
In next step the dried material is grinded using electric grinder to obtain the powdered material. The<br>
powdered material is then passed through a sieve no. 80 to obtain the Alternanthera bettzichiana<br>
powdered material ready for extraction.<br>
In the final step the obtained Altemanthera bettzichiana powdered material is subjected to solvent<br>
extraction at a temperature of about 20 to 60 °C to obtain an Altemanthera bettzichiana extract.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention the solvent extraction comprises extraction with at least one solvent.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention the solvent extraction is successive solvent extraction which comprises extraction of the plant material using at teast one solvent having low polarity followed by extraction with at least one solvent having high polarity.<br>
Typically, the solvent used for extraction is at least one selected from the group consisting of water, petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and ethanol.<br>
In successive solvent extraction, a dried material was extracted with different solvents, starting<br>
from solvent of low polarity by using soxhlet extraction apparatus. After extraction by one solvent,<br>
material is removed from thimble, dried and recharged, extracted with solvent of successively high<br>
polarity.<br>
Typically, the glass Soxhlet apparatus consist of four parts<br><br>
•	Round bottom flask (RBF),<br>
•	Main body/Thimble,<br>
•	Syphone glass tube, and<br>
•	Condenser.<br>
150 gm of dried, powered crude drug was kept in a filter paper cover which was already placed in thimble. Then the solvent was slowly poured onto it. The solvent from thimble goes to lower round bottom flask via siphon tube due to the siphoning or siphon cycle. Such 2-3 cycles of solvent were performed and then the drug powder was kept for 12 hrs with solvent for imbibitions. After 12 hours imbibitions, solvent from flask heated to form vapors. Due to heat the solvent from round bottom flask gets converted into its vapors and then these vapors pass .via side tube into the condenser where it gets condensed. This solvent was dripped again on to drug material which was placed in thimble. This process was continued till thimble gets filled with solvent and when level of solvent reaches to siphon tube, pulling of whole solvent into the flask is taken place. All this events repeated several times and drug material was extracted continuously with fresh solvent. This process was performed for 3 days and when siphon solution showed negative test for phytoconstituents, extraction was completed. Then the extracts were filtered in hot condition and distilled on water bath. All the extract was finally dried at low temperature under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator.<br>
Typically, the dried powdered plant material was extracted successively with petroleum ether followed by chloroform, 90% ethanoi and water.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention there is provided an aqueous<br>
extract which is prepared by cold maceration.<br>
100 gm of powered crude drug was taken into 2 liters of conical flask. To this, one liter of solvent<br>
was added with vigorous shaking. Then the flask was plugged with cotton plug and aluminum foil<br>
and kept aside for 12 hours. After 12 hours flask was again shacked vigorously and then flask was<br>
allowed to stand for 7 days with frequent shaking. After completion of 7 days the fluid extract was<br>
separated by decantation and filtration. Typically, the filtration was carried out by using vacuum<br>
filtration assembly.<br>
Typically, the extract is in the form selected from the group consisting of powder, semisolid and<br>
liquid.<br>
In accordance with the second aspect of the present invention there is provided an Alternanthera bettzichiana extract; said extract comprising:<br>
i.      steroids;<br><br>
ii.     glycosides;<br>
i i i.     carbohyd rate; and<br>
iv.     alkaloids. wherein said extract is alcoholic extract with extractive value of about 32% and is useful in the treatment of at least one disease  selected from the group consisting of cancer, inflammatory diseases and bacterial infections.<br>
In accordance with the third aspect of the present invention there is provided an Alternanthera bettzichiana extract; said extract comprising: i.      proteins; ii.      glycosides; iii.     carbohydrate; and iv.      alkaloids. wherein said extract is aqueous extract with extractive value of about 19% and is useful in the treatment of at least one disease selected from the group consisting of cancer, inflammatory diseases and bacterial infections.<br>
In accordance with the fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided an Alternanthera bettzichiana extract; said extract comprising:<br>
i.      steroids; and<br>
ii.     glycosides. wherein said extract is chloroform extract with extractive value of about 25% and is useful in the treatment of at least one disease selected from the group consisting of cancer, inflammatory diseases and bacterial infections.<br>
In accordance with one of the embodiments of the present invention the glycosides comprises cardiac glycoside, anthraquinone glycoside, saponin glycoside and coumarin glycoside.<br>
Physicochemical and Phy to-chemical investigation of the extract:<br>
a)	Total Ash:<br>
1g powdered drug was taken in a tarred silica dish previously dried and weighed. It was ignited in a furnace until free from carbon. The ash obtained was weighed.<br>
b)	Acid Insoluble ash:<br>
To the crucible containing the total ash, 25 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid was added, covered with a watch glass boiled gently for 5 minutes. The insoluble matter was collected on an ash less filter paper, washed with hot water until the filtrate is neutral. It was allowed to cool in a suitable<br><br>
desiccator for 30 minutes, and then weighed without delay (World Health Organization, Geneva, 1998 and Khandelwal K.R., 2001).<br>
c)	Water-soluble ash:<br>
To the crucible containing the total ash, 25ml of water was added and boiled for 5 minutes. The insoluble matter was collected on an ash less filter paper, washed with hot water, and ignited in a crucible for 5 minutes. The weight of this residue was subtracted from the weight of total ash.<br>
d)	Extractive Value:<br>
This is the most useful method for the evaluation of a crude drug, which gives the idea about the active constituents in the given amount of medicinal plant material when extracted with solvents. About 5 g of the powdered drug was weighed in a weighing bottle and transferred to a dry 250 ml conical flask. 100 ml graduated flask was filled to the delivery mark with the solvent. The weighing bottle was washed out and the washings were poured, together with the rest of the solvent into the conical flask. Then the flask was corked with cotton plug and aluminum foils and was set aside for 24 hours with vigorous shaking. After completion of period, it was filtered into a 50 ml measuring cylinder up to mark. 25 ml of this filtrate was transferred to a weighed, thin porcelain dish and evaporated to dryness on a water-bath. The drying was complete in an oven at 100°C followed by cooling in a desiccator and weighing. The percentage w/w of extractive with reference to the air-dried drug was calculated.<br><br>
Ash Value	Total ash	14%<br>
	Acid-insoluble ash	1.6%-<br>
	Water soluble ash	3.0 %<br>
Extractive values	Petroleum ether    	6.4 %<br>
	Chloroform	25.6 %<br>
	Ethano!	32.0 %<br>
	Water	19.2%<br>
The above table depicts the physicochemical characters in which the total ash value was higher than that of acid insoluble and water soluble ash value and a decrease in the acid insoluble ash value may be due to presence of siliceous matters. The ethanolic extractive value was higher than petroleum ether, chloroform and aqueous extractive value revealing the presence of larger amounts of alcohol soluble constituents in the plant material. The yield of petroleum ether extract was dull greenish semisolid mass with a yield of 6.4% w/w, 25.6% w/w chloroform extract in the form of brilliant green-brown semisolid, 32% w/w for ethanolic extract in the form of dark brown semisolid mass, while aqueous extract yield found to be 19.2% w/w in the form of black-brown semisolid mass.<br>
A) HPTLC detection of cardiac glycosides:<br><br>
Ethanolic extract (10 mg/ml) and chloroform extract (10 mg/ml) were dissolved in ethanol and chloroform respectively. An appropriate volume30 pi\, 20 \i\, 10 u! and 05 uj for ethanolic extract and 20 μl, 12 μl, 07 μl and 03 ul for chloroform extract were applied on HPTLC plate, developed using Ethyl Acetate- Methanol- Ethanol- Water (16ion.<br>
Derivatizing Reagent: Anisaldehyde -.2: 2.2: 0.8: 1.6) as mobile phase and scanned at 254 nm and 366 nm before and after derivatizat Sulphuric acid reagent (0.5 ml Anisaldehyde is mixed with 10 ml Glacial Acetic Acid, followed by 85 ml methanol and 5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid in that order).<br>
After spraying with anisaldehyde-sulphuric acid reagent, the ethanolic extract showed nine well resolved peaks at Rf 0.12, 0.32, 0.41, 0.51, 0.55, 0.68, 0.83, 0.88 and 0.90 (Table 1). Rf values with 0.12, 0.32, 0.83 were found to be the major one's with about 23.51, 26.69 and 31.59 peak areas (Figure 1A), respectively (Tablel). While the chloroform extract showed seven peaks at Rf 0.48, 0.64, 0.69, 0.77, 0.84, 0.87, and 0.92 (Table 2). Rf values with 0.48 and 0.77 were found to be the major one with about 29.85, 21.33 peak areas (Figure IB), respectively (Table 2).Very week fluorescence quenching at 254 nm (Figure la) without chemical treatment, presence of light blue and dark blue fluorescence (Figure lb) in ethanoiic extract and orange, pah brown fluorescence (Figure Ic) in chloroform extract at 366 nm were the confirmatory mark for the presence of cardiac glycosides (Wagner H., et al. 1984) in A. bettzichiana.<br>

F: HPTLC detection of Carbohydrates:<br>
05 g of powdered plant material was boiled with 25 ml hot 80% alcohol with stirring. Then the solution was decanted in to a suitable flask, and the solids were again re-extracted with 80% alcohol. Then the mixture was transferred to the flask, and allowed it to cool. The combined extracts were filtered and evaporated until alcohol odor disappears. The resulting extract was filtered through a thin mat of Celite in a Buchner funnel. Then the Celite layer was washed with small amount of distilled water. The washings and filtrate were diluted to 50 ml with distilled water. Then the purification was done with the addition of lead acetate to the solution, till formation of precipitate takes place. Shake the contents and allow it to stand for few minutes. Filter the contents in a beaker containing an excess amount of sodium acetate crystals. Formation of precipitate takes place, which was then filtered and washed with small amount of distilled water. The filtrate and washings were finally diluted up to 50 ml with distilled water. A precoated HPTLC plate was soaked in 0.3NNaH2PO4 solution for one minute. Immediately removed after one minute and dried at 100°C for 30 min. 25 ul, 20 ul, 15 ul and 10 ul of above filtrate was applied on HPTLC plate, developed using Toluene: n-butanol-acetone- 0.3N.NaH2PO4 (4:5:1) as mobile phase and scanned at 254 nm, 366 nm and 530 nm before and after derivatization.<br>

Example 1: Antibacterial Studies:<br>
The antimicrobial screening of various extracts of A. beltzichiana was performed by using agar disc diffusion method and was tested against gram positive bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative strains of E. coli and Salmonella typhi. Table 9 depicts the results of antimicrobial activity of the various extracts of A. beltzichiana. The results of zone of inhibition revealed that the petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol and aqueous extract posses antimicrobial activity in a concentration dependant manner against the test organisms and was also comparable with the standard drugs streptomycin (10 ug/ml) included in the study. As shown in table 9, the extracts of A. beltzichiana showed antimicrobial activity with the diameter of zone of inhibition (Figure 4.6.1) ranging from 4.9 mm to 13.8 mm. The petroleum ether extract exhibited<br><br>
zone of inhibition (mm) ranging between 7.0 ± 0.6 to 9.5 ± 0.9 against the tested organisms. The chloroform extract exhibited zone of inhibition (mm) ranging between 7.0 ± 0.7 to 11.0 ± 1.0 against the tested organisms. The ethanolic extract showed zone of inhibition (mm) ranging between 8.0 ± 0.7 to 13.8 • 0.9 and the aqueous extract revealed 4.9 ± 0.5 to 7.4 ± 0.6 mm zone of inhibition against the tested organisms. No zone of inhibition was observed in E. coli with aqueous extract. Ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana exhibited significant antibacterial activity. In case of all these extracts MIC 80 to 120 jig/ml was observed against the test organisms and was determined by using broth dilution method.<br>

Example 2: Anti-inflammatory activity of A. bettzichiana extracts:<br>
A) Animals utilized for Anti-inflammatory Studies<br>
Albino wistar rat within weight range of 200-250 g were used for the anti-inflammatory studies. They were housed in polyethylene cages under standard conditions of 12 h light and dark cycle at 25 ± 2°C. Animals were supplemented with standard pelletized feed (Amrut Rat Feed, Pune, India) and water was made available ad libitum. The ethical clearance was approved by IAEC of R.C. Pate! Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Shirpur (M.S.) with resolution number RCCOP/IAEC/2007-08/42. Anti-inflammatory activity of the ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana was evaluated using acute and chronic inflammatory models. Acute activity was evaluated by<br><br>
Carrageenan induced rat paw edema method (Winter C.A., et al. 1962) and the chronic activity was evaluated by cotton pellet granuloma model (D, Arcy P.F., et al. 1960).<br>
I) Carrageenan Induced Paw Edema Model:<br>
Wistar albino rats were randomly divided in five groups (n=6) and 12 h prior to the experiments, the animals were deprived of food and water was made available during experiments. The first group (negative control) received normal saline (0.9% Nacl), second group (positive control) received 10 mg/kg p.o., diclofenac sodium and rest of the three groups received ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana at the dose of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg p.o., concentrations. In animals of all the groups acute inflammation was produced by sub plantar injection of 0.1 ml of 1% Carrageenan (A.4) in normal saline in right hind paw of rat. Animals were pre-medicated with drug/extracts 1 h before Carrageenan injection. Paw volumes (in ml) was measured by dislocation of the water Column in a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile 7140, Italy) immediately after Carrageenan application at 1, 2, and 3 h intervals after the stimulus (Winter C.A., et al. 1962).<br>
The volume of paw recorded just before Carrageenan injection was recorded as initial volume (Vo) in each case. The mean percent rise in the paw volume was determined by the following formula (Chandragouda R. Patil, et al. 2009)<br><br>
Where Vt = Volume at different intervals after Carrageenan injection<br>
Different doses of ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana showed dose dependant significant antiinflammatory activity. The dose concentration of 100 mg/kg did not exhibit significant activity in the early phase of I h (Table 10). But in the later phase (2 h and 3 h), the dose of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana significantly decreased rise in paw volume as compared to control (Table 11). It was observed that the dose 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg inhibited increase of paw volume (1.1 ± 0.096 and 1.1 ± 0.031 respectively) as compared with control (1.3 ± 0.021). The diclofenac sodium (Standard drug) also exhibited significant inhibition in rise of paw volume (Table 10). The test drug showed 52%, 39%, and 32% inhibition in rise of paw edema at the doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg respectively at the end of 3 hrs. The percent rise of paw volume of diclofenac sodium, a reference standard drug, was found to be 23% (Table 11).<br><br>
The Carrageenan inflammation is a useful model to detect oral action of anti-inflammatory agents (Di Rosa M., et al. 1971). The development of Carrageenan induced edema is biphasic, the early phase (1-2 h) is mainly mediated by histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins. After which increased vascular permeability is maintained by the release of kinins up to 2.30 hrs. The later phase (from 2.30 up to 6 hsr.) is sustained by prostaglandin release and mediated by bradykinin, leukotriens, polymorphonuclear cells and prostaglandins produced by tissue macrophages (Britto A.R.M.S., et al. 1998). The later phase is reported to be sensitive to most of the clinically effective antiinflammatory agents (Smucker E., et al. 1967). The ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana revealed significant acute anti-inflammatory activity in early phase (Figure 7A and 7B) as well as later phase (Figure 7C).<br>

II) Cotton Pellet Induced Granuloma Model:<br>
Chronic or proliferative phase of inflammation was assessed by cotton pellet granuloma in rat (D' Arcy, et at I960). The model was based on the foreign body granuloma formed in rats by subcutaneous implantation of compressed cotton pellets. After several days, histologically giant cells and undifferentiated connective tissue can be measured by weighing the dried pellets after<br>
removal.<br>
The cotton pellets weighing exactly 15 ± 1 mg each, were made from cotton rolls. Then the pellets were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 121°C and 15 lb pressure. Then the pellets were soaked in distilled water containing penicillin and streptomycin and implanted subcutaneously in to both sides of the groin region of each rat under light ether anesthesia, after shaving the fur of the animals. In this model, the animals were divided in to five groups as described in Carrageenan induced rat paw edema model. The drug and extracts were administered orally to the respective group of animals for seven consecutive days, from the day of cotton pellet implantation. On the 8lh day, the animals were anaesthetized again; the cotton pellets were removed surgically and made free from extragenous tissues. The pellets were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and dried at 60°C to constant weight. The weight of the cotton pellet before implantation was subtracted from the weight of the dried granuloma pellets. The increase in dry weight of the pellets was taken as a measure of granuloma formation.<br>
The cotton pellet granuloma bioassay is considered a chronic inflammation study model for studies on chronic inflammation and considered as a typical feature of chronic inflammatory reaction (Spector W.G., 1969). During the study with reference to chronic model, pellet caused a significant increase in granuloma weight in control group. The study of ethanolic extract of A. beiizichiana on chronic and proliferative phase of inflammation indicated that ethanolic extract (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) slightly but significantly (P
The cotton pellet method is widely used to evaluate the transudative and proliferative components of the chronic inflammation. In this model, inflammation and, granuloma develops during the period of several days (D. Sheshadrishekar, et al 2009). Inflammation involves proliferation of<br><br>
macrophages, neutrophils and fibroblasts, which are basic sources of granuloma formation (Figure 8C). The wet weight of the cotton pellets correlates with the transuda; the dry weight of the pellets correlates with the amount of granulomatous tissue (Olajide O.A., et ah, 2000). Hence, the degree in the weight of granuloma indicates that the proliferative phase was effectively suppressed by the ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana.<br>
The present anti-inflammatory protocol showed that the ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana elicited a significant anti-inflammatory activity in Carrageenan induced paw edema (acute) and cotton pellet granuloma (chronic) rat models. This  effect may be due to presence of secondary metabolites, probable coumarins, steroids and alkaloids present in the plant. This study indicates that the ethanolic extract of A. bettzichiana possess significant anti-inflammatory activity.<br>

B16F10 melanoma cell line is a highly metastatic melanoma cell line (G.Kuttan, et ai 2005) which gives rise to a tumour nodule in most mouse lines. Ex-vivo melanoma tumour was -induced by B16F10 melanoma cell lines. Five lakh cells were injected subcutaneously and after 8-10 days tumour started growing- When the tumour was palpable, the tumour volume was measured at a given interval of days. When the tumour was observed as palpable, the tumour volume measurement was started from the 5th day and calculated the mean of every 5th day till 25th day. During first few days of drug treatment (5th-l0lh days) slow and steady tumour growth was observed in all groups (Figure 9 A). During 1 l'h-15th day tumour volume was increased rapidly in all the cases (Figure 9B). No tumour regression was noticed in test as well as radiation group. But from 15th-20th days and onward, a drastic regression in tumour size was noticed in test groups as compared to radiation group (Figure 9C). On the other hand, on the 25th day, the tumour volume in control group was doubled by 10 folds (Figure 9D). From the observed values it was cleared that, both the extract revealed statistically significant (P
The most remarkable feature observed during in vivo antitumour activity was ethanolic extract of micropropagated plant material (EEMPM) of A. bettzichiana revealed significant dose dependant regression in tumour volume between 16th-25th day (Figure 9C and Figure 9D) of studies as compared to ethanolic extract of wild plant material (EEWPM). From the overall results, it was well deared that A bettzichiana has shown the tumour inhibition potential.<br><br>
C] In vitro Anti-tumour Activity:<br>
I)	Cell Culture:<br>
The B16F10 melanoma cell lines were provided by Department of Research, Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital and Research, Bhopal (M.P.). Cells were cultured in 5 ml Eagle's minimum essential media (EMBM) in Petri plates containing NaHCO3 (220 mg/100 ml). Media containing NaHCO3 was supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FES) and streptomycin plus penicillin (100 μg/ml and 100 IU/ml, respectively). Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C until near confluence. A confluent monolayer was detached with 0.25% trypsin in PBS (pH 7.4, 0.01 M) and suspension was utilized for subculturing. Serially cultured cell lines at third stages were utilized for in vitro antitumour activity (Rodrigueg J., 2002). All the processes were carried out strictly under aseptic condition in a vertical laminar flow chamber.<br>
The in vitro screening was performed by inoculating l x l05 cells/ml of suspension in culture media and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. After 3 h, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of EEWPM and EEMPM of A. bettzichiana. Another set of parallel cultures was also run throughout the study. Duplicate plates of each culture were incubated for further 24 h. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the cells were trypsinized (0.25% in PBS) and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Supernant was discarded and the cells were re-suspended in PBS to make protein free suspension. Then the cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion test and counted using neuber's WBC counting chamber.<br>
II)	Drug Treatment:<br>
Ethanolic extract of wild plant material (EEWPM) and micropropagated plant material (EEMPM) of A. bettzichiana were prepared at a concentration of 250 mg/ml, 500 mg/ml, and 750 mg/ml in DDW. The drug extracts were treated with plates containing B16F10 melanoma cell lines. While a plate containing B16F10 melanoma cell lines only was maintained as control during the study.<br>
III)	Trypan Blue Exclusion Test:<br>
The percentage of viable and non-viable cells was determined by using trypan blue exclusion test (James Kumi-Diaka, et al. 1999). It is based on the principle that live cells posses intact cell membrane that exclude certain dyes such as trypan blue, eosin or propidium. Cell growth and was measured by adding I part of 0.4% trypan blue with 1 part of cell suspension. The mixture was then allowed to incubate in room temperature for 3. min. and cells were immediately counted using hemocytometer. Percent cell viability was calculated by the formula: Number of viable cells (Unstained cells)<br>
Cell Viability=	X 100<br><br>
Total number of cells (Stained and unstained cells)<br>
The in vitro cytotoxic effect of different concentrations of ethanolic extract of wild plant material (EEWPM) and ethanolic extract of micropropagated plant material (EEMPM) of A bettzichiana species on cell viability was determined by using B16FI0 melanoma cell lines. Treatment of extracts against B16FI0 melanoma cell lines, at all concentrations showed decrease in percent cell viability as compared to that control when examined by trypan blue exclusion test. In overall variations of test samples, 750 mg/ml concentration of both types of extracts (EEWPM and EEMPM) showed its best activity (Figure 10A).<br>
Both the extracts revealed significant dose dependant activity with decrease in the total number of viable cells with increasing number non-viable cells (Table 15). Below 45% of ceil viability at 750 mg/ml concentration as compared with control as 100% was observed in case of both the extracts (Figure 10B).<br>
