DECELERATION DEPENDENT SHIFT CONTROL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     This   application   claims   the   benefit   of   U.S.   Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/815,147, filed on June 20, 2006. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a powertrain having an<br>
automatic transmission driven by an internal combustion engine through a torque<br>
converter, and more particularly to a deceleration dependent shift control for an<br>
automatic transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Vehicle powertrains typically include a prime mover, such as an<br>
internal combustions engine, that drives a transmission through a coupling<br>
device. In some cases, the transmission includes an automatic transmission that<br>
is driven by the prime mover through a torque converter. The transmission<br>
multiplies the engine drive torque by a desired gear ratio and transfers the<br>
multiplied drive torque to a driveline to propel the vehicle.<br>
[0005] A control module regulates operation of the transmission based<br>
upon vehicle operating parameters including, but not limited to, vehicle speed<br>
1<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
and   throttle   position.      More   specifically,   the   control   module   includes<br>
predetermined shift lines that are used to command upshift and downshifts.<br>
[0006] In some instances, the vehicle is rapidly decelerated, for<br>
example, to avoid a collision or to otherwise come to a rapid stop. As the vehicle<br>
decelerates, several events can simultaneously occur including, but not limited<br>
to, suspension movement, axle wind-up and a transmission downshift. Under<br>
certain conditions, a transmission downshift can result in undesired driveline<br>
disturbances in the form of noise (e.g., an audible clunk) and/or driveline<br>
oscillations.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, the present invention provides a transmission<br>
control system for regulating operation of an automatic transmission of a vehicle.<br>
The transmission control system includes a first module that provides a<br>
predetermined shift schedule including upshift and downshift lines and a second<br>
module that offsets each of the upshift and downshift lines by an offset amount to<br>
provide modified upshift and downshift lines when a deceleration of the vehicle<br>
exceeds a threshold deceleration. A third module regulates operation of the<br>
automatic transmission based on the modified upshift and downshift lines.<br>
[0008] In one feature, the transmission control system further includes<br>
a fourth module that determines the offset amount based on at least one of a<br>
current gear ratio of the automatic transmission and the deceleration.<br>
2<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
[0009] In another feature, the offset amount is a fixed, predetermined<br>
amount.<br>
[0010] In another feature, the second module stores a base downshift<br>
line vehicle speed, and sets the offset amount to zero when a current vehicle<br>
speed falls below the base downshift line vehicle speed.<br>
[0011] In another feature, the second module initiates a timer upon<br>
executing the step of offsetting, and sets the offset amount to zero when the<br>
timer achieves a threshold time.<br>
[0012] In still another feature, the second module sets the offset<br>
amount to zero when a throttle position exceeds a threshold throttle position.<br>
[0013] In yet other features, the second module monitors a vehicle<br>
speed, and decays the offset amount towards zero when the vehicle speed<br>
accelerates back through the upshift lines. The second module decays the offset<br>
amount based on a decay rate. The decay rate is a predetermined, fixed value.<br>
Alternatively, the decay rate is determined based on an acceleration of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0014] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
4<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0022] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary powertrain 10 is<br>
illustrated and includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a<br>
torque converter 16. More specifically, air is drawn into an intake manifold 18 of<br>
the engine 12 through a throttle 20. The air is mixed with fuel and the air/fuel<br>
mixture is combusted within cylinders 22 to reciprocally drive pistons (not shown)<br>
within the cylinders 22. The pistons rotatably drive a crankshaft (not shown) to<br>
provide drive torque. Exhaust generated by the combustion process is<br>
exhausted from the engine through an exhaust manifold 26. Although 4 cylinders<br>
are illustrated, it is appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in<br>
vehicles having any number of cylinders.<br>
[0023] The drive torque is transferred through the torque converter 16<br>
to drive the transmission 14. The transmission 14 multiplies the drive torque by a<br>
desired gear ratio to provide a modified drive torque. The modified drive torque<br>
is transferred to a vehicle driveline (not shown) by a transmission output shaft 28.<br>
The transmission 14 can includes an automatic transmission that is automatically<br>
shifted based on a vehicle speed (VVEH) and a throttle position, as discussed in<br>
further detail below.<br>
[0024] A control module 30 regulates operation of the powertrain based<br>
on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, the control module 30<br>
regulates a throttle opening or throttle position (TPS) corresponding to an<br>
5<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
effective throttle area (AEFF) via a throttle actuator 32. A throttle position sensor<br>
34 generates a throttle position signal based on the angular position of the<br>
throttle 20. The control module 30 regulates operation of the transmission 14<br>
based on vehicle operating parameters. More specifically, a crankshaft position<br>
sensor 36 generates a crankshaft position signal, which is used to determine an<br>
actual engine speed (RPMENG)<br>
[0025] Referring now to Figure 2, the control module 30 adjusts a gear<br>
ratio of the transmission 14 based on the throttle position (i.e., TPS) and VVEH-<br>
More specifically, the control module 30 includes a plurality of pre-programmed<br>
upshift and downshift lines based on VVEH and TPS, which is measured as a<br>
percentage of throttle opening. When the TPS and/or VVEH cross one of the shift<br>
lines, the control module 30 commands a corresponding shift. In the exemplary<br>
graph of Figure 2, upshift and downshift lines are provided for an exemplary 4-<br>
speed automatic transmission. The exemplary downshift lines include 2-1,3-<br>
2 and 4-3 downshift lines. The exemplary upshift lines include 1 - 2, 2 - 3 and<br>
3-4 upshift lines. The lines also include torque converter clutch (TCC) apply<br>
and release lines. For example, if the VVEH is 20 kilometers per hour (kph) and<br>
the TPS is 25%, the automatic transmission is in 2nd gear. If VVEH decreases<br>
past the 2 - 1 downshift line, while the %Throttle decreases or remains constant,<br>
a downshift from 2nd gear to 1st gear is commanded. Similarly, if VVEH increase<br>
past the 2-3 upshift line, an upshift from 2nd gear to 3rd gear is commanded.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 3, the deceleration dependent shift<br>
control of the present invention temporarily offsets the shift lines based on a<br>
6<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
deceleration of the vehicle (i.e., VVEH) More specifically, the acceleration of the<br>
vehicle (aVEH) is determined based on the transmission output shaft signal<br>
(TOSS) and is continuously monitored. If aVEH is negative, the vehicle is deemed<br>
to be decelerating. Furthermore, if aVEH is less than a threshold acceleration<br>
(a-THR) (i.e., is more negative than aTHR), the deceleration dependent shift control<br>
enters an offset mode and offsets the downshift and upshift lines (see phantom<br>
lines). For example, at point A of Figure 3, VVEH is approximately 32 kph and the<br>
transmission is in 4th gear. The vehicle is rapidly decelerated towards point B. In<br>
response to the rapid deceleration, the shift lines are offset. It should be noted<br>
that although only a single offset downshift line is illustrated, it is anticipated that<br>
all of the upshift and downshift lines are offset.<br>
[0027] The offset amount can be a predetermined, fixed value (e.g., 4<br>
kph) or can be determined based on aVEH and/or the current gear. For example,<br>
if the deceleration is very rapid, the offset is greater than if the deceleration is<br>
slower. Alternatively or additionally, the offset can be based on the current gear<br>
ratio. For example, the offset is greater if the vehicle is decelerating and the<br>
transmission is in a higher gear than if the transmission is in a lower gear.<br>
[0028] Upon entering the offset mode, the deceleration shift control<br>
stores the original or base downshift line (e.g., 2-1) and an offset timer tOFFSET is<br>
initiated. The offset mode can be exited upon tOFFSET achieving a threshold time<br>
(tTHR) (e.g., 5 seconds), upon TPS exceeding a TPS threshold (TPSTHR) or upon<br>
VVEH falling below the base downshift line (e.g., the original 2 - 1 downshift line).<br>
For example, as VVEH moves towards point B in Figure 3, and crosses the base 2<br>
7<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
- 1 downshift line, the offset mode is exited and all of the offsets are set equal to<br>
zero (i.e., all of the upshift and downshift lines go back to normal). With<br>
particular reference to Figure 4, the offset mode is exited upon TPS exceeding<br>
TPSTHR, even though the base 2 - 1 downshift line is not crossed.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 5, the offset can decay to zero over<br>
time if there is a sudden reversal in aVEH and VVEH increases. In the exemplary<br>
maneuver illustrated in Figure 5, aVEH is sufficient to enter the offset mode,<br>
however, after VVEH crosses the offset 2-1 downshift line and downshifts to 1st<br>
gear, VVEH suddenly increases. As VVEH moves towards the offset upshift lines,<br>
the offset value decays. In other words, as VVEH moves towards the offset upshift<br>
lines, the offset value decays so that the offset upshift lines are effectively<br>
moving toward VVEH. For example, an upshift from 1st to 2nd gear is commanded<br>
at the fully offset 1-2 upshift line (e.g., offset by 4 kph). An upshift from 2nd to<br>
3rd gear is commanded at the less than fully offset 2-3 upshift line (e.g., the<br>
offset has decayed to less than 4 kph). The offset continues to decay at a<br>
predetermined decay rate until the offset is 0 kph. It is anticipated that the decay<br>
rate can be a predetermined fixed amount or can be determined based on aVEH<br>
as VVEH accelerates back through the upshift lines.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 6, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
deceleration dependent shift control will be described in detail. In step 600,<br>
control determines whether aVER is less than an acceleration threshold (aTHR)- If<br>
aVEH is less than aTHR, the vehicle is sufficiently decelerating to enter the offset<br>
mode, and control continues in step 602. If aVEH is not less than aTHR, the vehicle<br>
8<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
is not sufficiently decelerating to enter the offset mode, and control loops back.<br>
In step 602, control enters the offset mode and offsets the upshift and downshift<br>
lines. As discussed in detail above, the shift lines can be offset by a fixed<br>
amount, or the offset amount can be determined based on the current gear ratio<br>
and/or aVEH Control initiates tOFFSET in step 604.<br>
[0031] In step 606, control determines whether VVEH has crossed the<br>
original or base 2-1 downshift line (VBASE2-1) If VVEH has crossed VBASE2-1,<br>
control continues in step 608. If VVEH has not crossed VBASE2-1, control<br>
determines whether TPS is greater than TPSTHR in step 610. If TPS is greater<br>
than TPSTHR, control continues in step 608. If TPS is not greater than TPSTHR,<br>
control determines whether tOFFSET is greater than tTHR in step 612. If tOFFSET is<br>
greater than tTHR, control continues in step 608. If tOFFSET is not greater than tTHR,<br>
control continues in step 614. In step 608, control exits the offset mode by<br>
setting the offsets to zero, and control ends.<br>
[0032] In step 614, control determines whether VVEH is accelerating<br>
back through the upshift lines (see Figure 5). If VVEH is not accelerating back<br>
through the upshift lines, control increments tOFFSET in step 616 and loops back to<br>
step 604. If VVEH is accelerating back through the upshift lines, control exits the<br>
offset mode by decaying the offsets to zero at a predetermined decay rate, and<br>
control ends. As discussed above, the decay rate and be a fixed amount or can<br>
be determined based on aVEH as the vehicle accelerates.<br>
[0033] Referring now to Figure 7, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
deceleration dependent shift control will be described in detail.   The exemplary<br>
9<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
modules include a shift line schedule module 700, an offset module 702, an<br>
offset amount module 704 and a transmission control module 706. The shift line<br>
schedule module 700 includes the predetermined or normal shift lines. The<br>
offset module 702 offsets the shift lines based on inputs from the various<br>
modules and provides the offset shift line information to the transmission control<br>
module 706, which regulates operation of the transmission. The offset amount<br>
module 704 determines the offset value based on aVEH and the current gear,<br>
which is provided by the transmission control module 706.<br>
[0034] The deceleration dependent shift control of the present<br>
invention inhibits driveline disturbances during rapid vehicle deceleration, by<br>
executing transmission downshifts earlier in the deceleration. In this manner, the<br>
deceleration event does not occur concurrently with other vehicle events (e.g.,<br>
axle wind, suspension dynamic events and the like). Other advantages of the<br>
deceleration dependent shift control are that it is functional for any gear ratio, and<br>
that there are various exit criteria, providing improved flexibility in implementing<br>
the control.<br>
[0035] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the<br>
following claims.<br>

21.	A method of regulating operation of an automatic transmission of a<br>
vehicle, comprising:<br>
monitoring an acceleration of said vehicle;<br>
providing a predetermined shift schedule including upshift and downshift<br>
lines;<br>
entering an offset mode by offsetting each of said upshift and downshift<br>
lines by an offset amount to provide modified upshift and downshift lines based<br>
on said acceleration;<br>
regulating operation of said automatic transmission based on said<br>
modified upshift and downshift lines; and<br>
exiting said offset mode when at least one of a plurality of exit conditions<br>
exists.<br>
22.	The method of claim 21 further comprising determining said offset amount<br>
based on at least one of a current gear ratio of said automatic transmission and<br>
said deceleration rate.<br>
23.	The   method   of  claim   21   wherein   said   offset  amount   is  a  fixed,<br>
predetermined amount.<br>
15<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
24.	The method of claim 21 further comprising storing a base downshift line<br>
vehicle speed, wherein said step of exiting includes setting said offset amount to<br>
zero when a current vehicle speed falls below said base downshift line vehicle<br>
speed.<br>
25.	The  method  of claim  21   further comprising  initiating  a timer upon<br>
executing said step of offsetting, wherein said step of exiting includes setting said<br>
offset amount to zero when said timer achieves a threshold time.<br>
26.	The method of claim 21 wherein said step of exiting includes setting said<br>
offset amount to zero when a throttle position exceeds a threshold throttle<br>
position.<br>
27.	The method of claim 21 further comprising monitoring a vehicle speed,<br>
wherein said step of exiting includes decaying said offset amount towards zero<br>
when said vehicle speed accelerates through said upshift lines.<br>
28.	The method of claim 27 wherein said decaying is achieved based on a<br>
decay rate.<br>
29.	The method of claim 28 wherein said decay rate is a predetermined, fixed<br>
value.<br>
16<br><br>
GP-308363-PTT-DLT<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000431<br>
17<br>
30.     The method of claim 28 wherein said decay rate is determined based on<br>
an acceleration of said vehicle.<br><br>
A transmission control system for regulating operation of an automatic<br>
transmission of a vehicle includes a first module that provides a predetermined<br>
shift schedule including upshift and downshift lines and a second module that<br>
offsets each of the upshift and downshift lines by an offset amount to provide<br>
modified upshift and downshift lines when a deceleration of the vehicle exceeds<br>
a threshold deceleration. A third module regulates operation of the automatic<br>
transmission based on the modified upshift and downshift lines.<br></td>
