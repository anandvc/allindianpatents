				<td>The present invention relates to a combination of compounds for introducing nucleic acids<br>
and/or protein into animal cells, tissue, organs or organisms in vitro, extracorporal, or in<br>
vivo. This combination or system comprises preparations suitable for administration to an<br>
animal or human, comprising as one component a bacterial vector genetically manipulated<br>
to contain nucleic acid sequences comprising a transgene, and a second component<br>
allowing the subsequent transcription, possibly translation of the transgene by controlled<br>
induction of the transgene activity within the bacterial vector as it is present within the<br>
animal or human.<br>
Applications of the system according to the invention are medical uses, e.g. immunization,<br>
tumor treatment, and release of pharmaceutically active compounds, e.g. hormones,<br>
immunomodulating compounds and pro-drug converting enzymes.<br>
Background state of art<br>
For traditional vaccination, attenuated pathogens are in use to elicit an immune response<br>
from the recipient organism that is also active against wild type pathogens. An example<br>
for the use of attenuated invasive bacteria as a vaccine is the use of attenuated<br>
enteropathogenic salmonella, providing protection against salmonellosis.<br>
Depending on the disease against which immunoprotection is intended, it is desired to<br>
elicit a variety of the immune responses such as the stimulation of antibody production<br>
and/or T-cell mediated immunity, systemically and/or mucosally. As the quality of these<br>
immunoreactions is at least in part dependent on the route of administration, a vector<br>
according to the invention can be designed to preferentially elicit a cellular and/or humoral<br>
immune response.<br>
Although effective in recognising antigens and marking antigen for subsequent removal,<br>
antibodies cannot bind to intracellular antigens, for example to bacteria which are<br>
contained within the phagosome of infected cells, or to cytosolic antigens of malignant<br>
cells, i.e. tumor cells. This part of the immune response is provided by the cellular immune<br>
2<br><br>
response, i.e. T-cells recognizing foreign peptide displayed on the outer surface of infected<br>
cells in conjunction with MHC-I and/or MHC-II complexes. However, in relation to tumor<br>
cells, the cellular immune response against these is often hampered by self-tolerance of the<br>
immune system against homologous constituents.<br>
In general, antigen specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), which are one sub-group of<br>
T-cells, are activated by interaction with antigen presented on the cell surface in a complex<br>
with MHC I, which is the presentation pathway for cytosolic protein of mammalian cells.<br>
Accordingly, antigen synthesized by invasive pathogens in the cytoplasm, or antigen<br>
synthesized by bacterial vectors based on attenuated invasive bacteria which liberate<br>
antigen into the cytoplasm, is efficient in eliciting the cellular immune response by CTL.<br>
Following this activation, CTL are immediately directed against infected cells that display<br>
the relevant antigenic peptides in complex with MHC I.<br>
Some invasive bacteria, e.g. salmonella, are able to specifically target professional antigen<br>
presenting cells (APC) in the infected organism. In the case of salmonella, the bacteria<br>
invade the mammalian organism mainly by passage through the M cells of Peyer patches<br>
within the small intestiny. Subsequent to passaging M cells, invasive bacteria infect<br>
dendritic cells and macrophages present in Peyer patches which are part of the mucosa<br>
associated lymphoid tissue. Peyer patches contain an increased number of APC of the gut<br>
associated lymphoid tissue, wherein bacteria can persist for days up to several weeks,<br>
depending on the degree of their attenuation. APC infected with salmonella can migrate<br>
into mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver, effectively transporting invaded bacteria<br>
into these tissues. Macrophages which are lysed after infection by invasive bacteria are<br>
phagocytosed by dendritic cells.<br>
Some invasive bacteria, e.g. salmonella, are able to replicate within the phagosome of<br>
mammalian cells, e.g. macrophages, by secreting a range of proteins and further effector<br>
molecules. These secreted molecules for example prohibit the import of NADPH oxidase<br>
into the phagosome, effectively preventing an immediate antibacterial response by the<br>
macrophages. As a further result of the infection with salmonella, caspase 1 is activated,<br>
leading to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-18) and initiating<br>
apoptosis of infected cells. Material of apoptotic macrophages which are phagocytosed by<br>
3<br><br>
dendritic cells enter the presentation pathway of MHCI and MHC II, in turn initiating<br>
specific T-cell responses.<br>
Some invasive bacteria, e.g. Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella spp., are able to<br>
replicate within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Upon lysis, the bacterial content can<br>
be released directly into the cytosol of infected cells, providing access to the MHC-I<br>
presentation pathway.<br>
It is known that bacterial vaccine strains can induce mucosal and systemic immune<br>
responses, e.g. Salmonella administered orally.<br>
Attracted by the efficiency of invasive bacteria to elicit an immune response, attenuated<br>
invasive bacteria have been investigated to serve as bacterial vectors for vaccines eliciting<br>
an immune response against a peptide foreign to the bacterial vector.<br>
In addition, attenuated invasive bacteria have been used for genetic vaccination and gene<br>
therapeutic purposes as carrier vehicles to introduce eukaryotic expression plasmids into<br>
mammalian cells. In order to allow transcription of DNA sequences introduced into a<br>
mammalian cell, the DNA needs to be transported into the cellular nucleus. One<br>
prerequisite for efficient DNA transfer is an efficient invasion of host cells by the bacterial<br>
carrier vehicle. After invasion of the host cell, lysis of the bacterial vector to release its<br>
contents into the cytoplasm and a subsequent effective translocation of DNA into the<br>
nucleus are essential steps for transcription of the eukaryotic expression plasmid.<br>
When using attenuated invasive bacteria as bacterial vectors for the transfer of protein<br>
and/or nucleic acid into mammalian cells, it is desirable to control the level of expression<br>
of said peptide and/or the copy number of nucleic acids. Up to now most attempts to<br>
control the expression of a foreign peptide by bacterial vectors rely on constitutive<br>
promoter sequences. Recently, also in vivo inducible promoters isolated from invasive<br>
bacteria, e.g. Salmonella, and have been used for this purpose. These promoters are<br>
regulated depending on the stage of the infectious cycle of said bacteria. Accordingly,<br>
such promoter sequences automatically respond to specific phases of the infectious cycle<br>
of the bacterium, so that they cannot be regulated by exerting an external influence. For<br>
4<br><br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome shortcomings of the known state of art in respect<br>
of bacterial vectors, especially their disadvantage of being essentially uncontrolled.<br>
In a first embodiment, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system of<br>
Pharmaceuticals for medical use as live vaccines. In this respect, the present invention<br>
especially seeks to provide a system of Pharmaceuticals, which are applicable<br>
systemically, nasally, orally, rectally and/or otherwise mucosally and which can be used to<br>
elicit a systemic immune response and/or one that is present within the mucosa associated<br>
lymphoid tissue of the intestiny and/or mucosa of the respiratory organs and/or of the<br>
genitals.<br>
For the development of potent vaccines, especially against infections transmitted via<br>
mucosal tissue, like infectious microorganisms, parasites, and viral infections like HIV, it<br>
is desirable for the vaccine to elicit cellular immune responses and/or antibody responses.<br>
The design of the bacterial vector, e.g. choice of the appropriate bacterial strain, allows to<br>
induce immune responses in the mucosa and/or systemically. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention also seeks to provide bacterial vectors for vaccines eliciting a humoral and/or<br>
cellular immune response both within mucosa and systemically based on non-invasive as<br>
well as on invasive bacteria, preferably attenuated strains.<br>
In order to control the activity of genetically manipulated attenuated invasive bacteria<br>
during their presence adjacent target cells and/or during their infection of target cells,<br>
which may be cultivated cells, cultivated or extracorporal tissue or extracorporal organs,<br>
preferably specific tissue or organs within an animal, the present invention seeks to<br>
provide a regulatory component acting in combination with the vector component to<br>
provide control by exertion of an influence external to the bacterial vector as well as<br>
external to the target cell and at will to regulate the activity of functionally linked nucleic<br>
acid sequences, e.g. of a transgene forming part of an expression cassette.<br>
In a second embodiment, it is an object of the present invention to provide a combination<br>
of pharmaceutical preparations for medical use for the delivery of peptide and/or nucleic<br>
6<br><br>
acid sequences for immunization, gene therapy, or other biologically active compounds,<br>
e.g. probiotic or functional food applications, e.g. for the delivery of beneficial factors<br>
within the intestiny of an animal, hormones, antibody, immunomodulating substances, or<br>
pro-drug converting enzymes.<br>
In a third and fourth embodiment, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
combination of pharmaceuticals for medical use in tumor therapy and for diagnostic<br>
purposes, respectively.<br>
In a fifth embodiment, it is an object of the present invention to provide a combination of<br>
compounds acting as an insecticide or vermicide realizing a tight control system which<br>
allows the arbitrary activation of the insecticidal and vermicidal activity, respectively.<br>
Apart from the need for the regulatory system to be responsive to an external inductor or<br>
repressor substance, a very tight control of the activity is preferred. Tight regulation by a<br>
regulatory element has the desired effect to substantially eliminate any activity of the<br>
transgene sequences functionally linked downstream in order to substantially avoid the<br>
presence of ribonucleic acid sequences and/or peptide and/or minimize the presence of<br>
plasmid DNA within the bacterial vector which can be detrimental to the vector's<br>
infectivity or detrimental to its transfer rate of the functionally linked gene product and/or<br>
nucleic acid sequence into the mammalian cell.<br>
In this respect, it has been found in preliminary experiments that expression of a<br>
heterologous peptide within a bacterial vector, for example under control of a constitutive<br>
promoter sequence, decreases its infectivity. Furthermore, high copy number plasmids<br>
encoding the desired peptide for transfection into a mammalian cell, although in principle<br>
preferable due to the higher content of the desired sequences, also result in a decreased<br>
infectivity of the bacterial vector in addition to being unstable within the vector in the<br>
absence of a selective pressure.<br>
General description of the invention<br>
The present invention achieves the above-mentioned objects by making use of the<br>
surprising finding that induction of RNA transcription and/or translation of protein from<br>
7<br><br>
the transgene under the control of a saccharide inducible promoter within bacterial vectors<br>
can be induced even when the bacterial vector is present in an animal like a mammalian<br>
organism, e.g. when the bacterial vector has been introduced to the animal or human being<br>
by concurrent or later introduction of the inductor saccharide to the animal or human<br>
being.<br>
For achieving the above-mentioned objects, the present invention provides the use of a<br>
bacterial vector, genetically manipulated to contain at least one transgene under the control<br>
of a saccharide inducible promoter, for administration to an animal for medical purposes,<br>
including the use as a functional food and/or for probiotic food applications, in<br>
combination with the use of the inductor saccharide for administration to an animal for<br>
medical purposes in order to induce the saccharide inducible promoter by separate<br>
administration to the animal. Preferably, the administration of inductor saccharide is<br>
carried out concurrent or subsequent to the administration of the bacterial vector.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention can make use of the property of bacterial vectors to<br>
preferentially migrate to and replicate in specific body regions, tissues or organs, e.g.<br>
professional antigen presenting cells or tumor tissue. By administration of the inductor<br>
saccharide to the animal or human simultaneously with the introduction of the bacterial<br>
vector, but preferably some time past the introduction of the bacterial vector, and without<br>
the necessity to apply the inductor saccharide within the vicinity of the bacterial vector,<br>
induction of the saccharide inducible promoter is arbitrarily controllable.<br>
In relation to the invention, reference to arbitrary activation of the saccharide inducible<br>
promoter, i.e. transgene activation, refers to the property of the invention to provide<br>
control of transgene activation essentially independent from the environment of the<br>
bacterial vector at the desired site of transgene activation, e.g. controllability by<br>
application of an inductor substance by an arbitrary act.<br>
It has been found surprisingly that the administration of the inductor saccharide to an<br>
animal that has concurrently or previously received a bacterial vector containing a<br>
transgene under the control of a saccharide inducible promoter is a feasible way to control<br>
8<br><br>
activity, i.e. transcription and/or translation of the transgene, essentially independent from<br>
the localization of the bacterial vector within the animal.<br>
In addition to overcoming the previously accepted necessity to directly apply the inductor<br>
saccharide within the immediate vicinity to a bacterium containing a transgene under the<br>
control of a saccharide inducible promoter, the present inventors have found that<br>
administration of the inductor saccharide in a distinct manner, and separately from the<br>
bacterial vector, i.e. without a close co-localization within a limited space to the bacterial<br>
vector, can still be used to induce the saccharide inducible promoter within the bacterial<br>
vector. Accordingly, oral, mucosal or systemic administration of the inductor saccharide to<br>
an animal that concurrently or previously has received bacterial vectors, independently by<br>
oral, mucosal or systemic administration, can be used to deliver nucleic acid and/or protein<br>
from the bacterial vector to cells, tissue or organs, e.g. tumor tissue, within the animal.<br>
Further, it has been found that the present invention advantageously allows to induce<br>
transcription and/or translation of the transgene under the control of a saccharide inducible<br>
promoter in a concentration dependent manner, i.e. by varying the amount of inductor<br>
saccharide that is administered to the animal that has received the bacterial vector.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention uses a bacterial vector and an inductor saccharide<br>
suitable for inducing an activity from the bacterial vector for producing a system or a<br>
combination of pharmaceutical preparations, comprising as a first compound a bacterial<br>
vector for administration for medical purposes, genetically manipulated to contain a<br>
transgene under the control of a saccharide inducible promoter and, as a second<br>
component, the inductor saccharide for administration for medical purposes for induction<br>
of the saccharide inducible promoter while the bacterial vector is present within an animal,<br>
e.g. within a mammal or a human patient to be treated.<br>
Generally, the pharmaceutical combination according to the invention is used for<br>
transcribing and/or translating the transgene contained in the bacterial vector concurrent to<br>
or, preferably, after its administration to an animal by the use of the inductor saccharide<br>
for administration to the animal for inducing the saccharide inducible promoter. In the<br>
present invention, the use of bacterial vectors for medical purposes is comprised in the<br>
9<br><br>
combination with the use of the inductor saccharide as a pharmaceutical compound for<br>
induction of the saccharide inducible promoter in a controlled manner, preferably by<br>
administration of the bacterial vector separate from the administration of the inductor<br>
saccharide. Bacterial vectors can be administered systemically, nasally, orally, rectally<br>
and/or otherwise mucosally in combination with the concurrent or subsequent<br>
administration of the inductor saccharide, essentially without limitations to the route or<br>
point in time of the administration in relation to the administration of the bacterial vector,<br>
in order to transcribe the transgene functionally linked to the saccharide inducible<br>
promoter.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the combination of compounds according to the present<br>
invention is used firstly for the administration of the bacterial vector and, at a second, later<br>
point of time, for the administration of the inductor saccharide to the same animal. In this<br>
embodiment, the properties of the bacterial vector to migrate to and/or replicate in certain<br>
tissues or organs within the mammalian body is utilized to deliver nucleic acids and/or<br>
protein to the region, where the bacterial vector accumulates. Surprisingly, it has been<br>
found that induction of the saccharide inducible promoter is possible by administration of<br>
the inductor saccharide to the animal, e.g. orally or systemically, is effecitve and<br>
essentially independent from the localization, that the bacterial vector has reached.<br>
In the embodiments of the invention, a pharmaceutical system or combination comprising<br>
two compounds for concurrent, preferably for subsequent administration is provided,<br>
namely a first component comprising a bacterial vector which is genetically manipulated<br>
to contain a transgene functionally linked to a saccharide inducible promoter and, as a<br>
second component, comprising the inductor saccharide. Accordingly, the present invention<br>
provides the use of a bacterial vector for production of a first component of a<br>
pharmaceutical system of compositions and the use of the inductor saccharide for<br>
production of a second component of the pharmaceutical system of compositions. In this<br>
pharmaceutical system or combination of compositions, the first component serves to<br>
introduce the nucleic acid sequences encoding the transgene under the control of the<br>
saccharide inducible promoter into the animal according to the route of administration and,<br>
predominantly, according to migration and accumulation of the vector within the animal;<br>
the second component serves for activation, e.g. induction of the first component by its<br>
10<br><br>
administration to the animal that contains, e.g. by concurrent, preferably by previous<br>
administration, the first component.<br>
Controlled induction of the transgene activity by the second component allows to regulate<br>
transcription of the transgene at the desired localization and time. A bacterial vector used<br>
as the first component for vaccination can introduce a transgene encoding an antigenic<br>
peptide into target cells and/or by using a very low copy number plasmid encoding the<br>
antigenic peptide, also bearing a high copy number origin of replication under the control<br>
of the saccharide inducible promoter.<br>
In a first embodiment, the pharmaceutical combination according to the invention can be<br>
used to elicit a systemic immune response and/or one that is present within the mucosa<br>
associated lymphoid tissue of the intestiny and/or mucosa of the respiratory organs or of<br>
the genitals.<br>
In a second embodiment, the pharmaceutical combination according to the invention can<br>
be used for the delivery of pharmaceutically active compounds to specified tissue regions<br>
within an animal, e.g. nucleic acid sequences, e.g. for gene therapy, or hormones,<br>
immuno-modulating substances, reactive RNA species or other biologically active<br>
compounds, e.g. immuno-reactive peptides for immunization, antibody, apoptose-inducing<br>
factors, or pro-drug converting enzymes.<br>
The combination of a bacterial vector component with the inductor component can<br>
advantageously be used for producing pharmaceutical preparations for use in tumor<br>
therapy, by itself or in combination with known pharmaceuticals or methods for tumor<br>
treatment, e.g. in combination with chemotherapy and/or with irradiation. For use in tumor<br>
therapy, several bacterial species are suitable for generation of the bacterial vector<br>
component, e.g. non-pathogenic obligate anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria which<br>
invade and selectively replicate within tumor, preferably solid tumors. However,<br>
attenuated strains of originally pathogenic bacteria can also be used for generating the<br>
bacterial vector component. The bacterial vector component of the invention in this<br>
embodiment is efficient to deliver peptide and/or nucleic acid sequences to tumor tissue<br>
upon application of the inductor saccharide because the properties of the vector to<br>
11<br><br>
preferentially, preferably selectively, colonize tumor tissue are realized during this use of<br>
the bacterial vector component for medical purposes.<br>
Accordingly, in a third embodiment, the pharmaceutical combination according to the<br>
invention is used for the treatment of tumors like cancer or other neoplastic tissue. In this<br>
embodiment, the natural preference of some bacteria that are used as bacterial vectors<br>
according to the invention for accumulation in and/or around tumor tissue is utilized, e.g.<br>
of Salmonella, E.coli and Clostridium, even to colonize tumor tissue. Preferably,<br>
subsequent to the localization of bacterial vector in the vicinity of tumor tissue, e.g. the<br>
colonization of a tumor, administration of the inductor saccharide by a route independent<br>
from the localization of the bacterial vector and at a later point in time, e.g. after<br>
colonization of tumor tissue by bacterial vector, is used.<br>
According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention for use in diagnostics and/or<br>
treatment of tumors, e.g. cancer, the bacterial vector component is provided with a<br>
monitoring transgene, characterized by encoding a product which can be monitored by<br>
detection of its activity using spectroscopical analysis. As monitoring transgenes, genes<br>
for luminescent and/or fluorescent proteins, e.g. GFP, eGFP, lux gene products, e.g.<br>
obtainable from Photorhabdus luminescens, luciferase as well as enzymes converting a<br>
pro-compound to a compound resulting in an increased signal in analytical expression can<br>
be used. As a result, presence and localization of bacterial vector can be followed, e.g. for<br>
identification of localization of tumor tissue and metastatic carcinoma, and for an<br>
assessment of localization and of the number of bacterial vector distributing in and<br>
colonizing the tissue, organ or animal, optionally also over the course of administration of<br>
inductor saccharide.<br>
In this embodiment, the bacterial vector may in addition to the monitoring transgene<br>
contain a transgene that provides anti-tumor activity, e.g. cytokines, antibody or toxic<br>
products, wherein the transgene is under the control of a saccharide inducible promoter,<br>
which is a different or the same as the saccharide inducible promoter controlling the<br>
monitoring transgene.<br>
12<br><br>
For the purpose of this disclosure, the term "animal" refers to vertebrates, e.g. to fish and<br>
to mammals, e.g. to farm and pet animals like dogs, cats, sheep, cattle, horses, camels,<br>
goats, preferably to humans, as well as to wild animals like vermin and insects.<br>
In relation to vermin and insects, which are regarded as pests, the combination according<br>
to the invention can be used as an insecticide and vermicide, respectively. In this fifth<br>
embodiment, the transgene to be induced within the animal after uptake of the bacterial<br>
vector by administration of the inductor saccharide is chosen to act as a poison, preferably<br>
specific poison to the vermin and insects, respectively.<br>
For constructing bacterial vectors, non-invasive or invasive bacteria can be used,<br>
genetically manipulated to comprise a saccharide inducible promoter controlling a nucleic<br>
acid sequence encoding the transgene. Induction of the saccharide inducible promoter<br>
causes transcription of the transgene, producing an RNA, e.g. an inhibitory RNA (iRNA),<br>
small interfering RNA (siRNA), or an mRNA, translatable into protein. As induction of<br>
the transcription of the transgene according to the invention within an animal or a human<br>
being is essentially independent from the localization which the bacterial vector has<br>
reached within the animal, transcription occurs at the site of accumulation of the bacterial<br>
vector, transcription and/or translation of the transgene occurs at the site of localization of<br>
the bacterial vector, i.e. extracellularly and/or intracellularly within the animal tissue.<br>
Depending on the transgene, the bacterial vector serves as a transport vehicle for the<br>
nucleic acid encoded by the transgene and/or for peptide translated from the transgene.<br>
Release of nucleic acid and/or peptide synthesized by the vector can also be obtained by<br>
partial or complete lysis of the bacterial vector, controlled by a saccharide inducible<br>
promoter and/or by secretion of peptide translated from the transgene.<br>
The bacterial vectors for use in the pharmaceutical combination according to the invention<br>
are based on non-invasive, e.g. commensal bacteria or on invasive bacteria, which are<br>
preferably attenuated, and which are useful for introducing peptide and/or nucleic acids<br>
into or adjacent to target cells or organisms. These bacterial vectors comprise a transgene,<br>
for example containing an expression cassette for a peptide and/or an expression cassette<br>
regulating an origin of replication and/or an expression cassette encoding untranslated<br>
RNA, wherein the expression cassette is operably linked to and under the control of a<br>
13<br><br>
saccharide inducible promoter as the specific regulatory element. As a further<br>
embodiment, the transgene may in addition to nucleic acid sequences functionally linked<br>
to the saccharide inducible promoter comprise protein encoding nucleic acid sequences,<br>
which are linked in one operon encoding two or more proteins, e.g. synthetic pathway<br>
enzymes. Further, different transgenes may be comprised in the bacterial vector,<br>
functionally linked to different saccharide inducible promoters to allow for separate<br>
induction of transgene activity by administration of the respective inductor saccharide.<br>
The transgene is operably linked to the saccharide inducible promoter, forming an<br>
expression cassette within the genome of the bacterial vector or, alternatively, on one<br>
plasmid replicable or maintainable within said bacterial vector. The transgene may be<br>
present within an expression cassette under the control of the saccharide inducible<br>
promoter, or its expression may be controlled indirectly by regulating the copy number of<br>
the transgene under the control of the saccharide inducible promoter. In the latter case, the<br>
saccharide inducible promoter indirectly controls the activity of the transgene by directly<br>
controlling the activation factor (e.g. a replicase) acting on an inducible origin of<br>
replication linked to the transgene.<br>
According to the invention, the saccharide inducible promoter originates from operator<br>
regions of bacterial origin, which are regulatable by saccharides, for instance inducible by<br>
increasing concentrations of a saccharide. In its preferred form, the inventive saccharide<br>
inducible promoter is gradually inducible, responding gradually to increasing<br>
concentrations of the saccharide.<br>
Examples for the saccharide inducible promoters to be used according to the invention are<br>
regulatory regions controlling catabolic enzymes of the bacterial degradation pathway of<br>
saccharides, for example the promoters encoding catabolic enzymes of the rhamnose or<br>
xylulose pathway, and, most preferably the arabinose promoter element PBAD from E. coli<br>
or a promoter from the ara-operon of Bacillus subtilis. The inductor substance for the<br>
saccharide inducible promoters to be used in connection with the invention are the<br>
corresponding saccharides, i.e. rhamnose in the case of the promoter element from the<br>
rhamnose operon, xylulose in the case of the promoter element from the xylulose operon,<br>
and L-arabinose in the case of the arabinose promoter. Activation of the saccharide<br>
14<br><br>
inducible promoter is obtained by adding the respective saccharide inductor to the culture<br>
medium of cells, tissue, organs or to an organism, respectively.<br>
The preferred saccharide inducible promoter to be used within the bacterial vectors<br>
according to the present invention is the promoter PBAD of the L-arabinose operon of E.<br>
coli regulating the transcription of the gene product araB (ribulokinase), araA (isomerase)<br>
as well as araD (epimerase). This promoter is regulated by the gene product araC, whose<br>
transcription is repressed by AraC itself. In the absence of L-arabinose, AraC forms a<br>
homodimer, binding to the initiator region 1 (II) and the operator region 2 (02), forming a<br>
DNA loop upstream of the PBAD resembling a termination loop which represses PBAD-<br>
When L-arabinose is present, AraC accepts L-arabinose into its binding pocket, changes<br>
its conformation and releases the DNA loop formation. Further, AraC as a homodimer<br>
with L-arabinose bound then binds to the initiator regions 1 and 2 (II, 12) upstream of<br>
PBAD, allowing both binding of the activating complex formed by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and<br>
cAMP receptor protein upstream of the regions II and 12 as well as allowing the binding<br>
of RNA polymerase downstream from the regions II and 12, thus effectively starting<br>
transcription from the promoter element PBAD- For a detailed description of the L-<br>
arabinose operon in E. coli, see Schleif, BioEssays 25.3, pp. 274-282 (2003).<br>
As an alternative to using saccharides which are metabolizable by the bacterial vector<br>
and/or by the recipient animal for induction of the saccharide inducible promoter,<br>
analogons and derivatives of the saccharide can be used as inductor saccharides.<br>
Analogons and derivatives of the saccharides are e.g. sugar alcohols, sugar isomers, as<br>
well as esterification, amidation, alkylation or alkoxylation products of sugar, which are<br>
included in the term inductor saccharide for the purposes of the invention.<br>
One of the considerable advantages of the saccharide inducible promoters to be used<br>
according to the present invention, especially of the preferred promoter element PBAD, is<br>
their tight regulation in the absence of inductor. Therefore, also structural genes encoding<br>
peptides which are potentially toxic to the bacterial vector, for instance the gene E of<br>
bacteriophage <d xi74 may be functionally linked to pbad and present within the></d>
bacterial vector according to the invention. Similarly, tight control of expression of a<br>
replicase acting on an inducible origin of plasmid replication is required. The tight<br>
15<br><br>
regulation of the promoter activity allows to create bacterial vectors containing DNA<br>
sequences, the activation of which would be detrimental to the viability or to the<br>
infectivity of the bacterial vector or would result in the loss of the plasmid containing<br>
these sequences.<br>
A further advantage of the promoter element PBAD is its response to gradually increasing<br>
concentrations of the inductor substance L-arabinose in the form of gradually increasing<br>
activity.<br>
The inductor saccharides used as inductors for the saccharide inducible promoters have the<br>
advantage of being non-toxic to the host cells and organisms targeted by the bacterial<br>
vector, e.g. to animals, and non-toxic to other cells of a target organism. Furthermore,<br>
saccharides can be administered by one of several routes (e.g. orally or systemically, i.e.<br>
intravenously, peritoneally, parenterally or intramuscularly) to spread through an animal<br>
or human organism to reach the bacterial vector according to the invention. Therefore,<br>
induction of the saccharide inducible promoter contained in the bacterial vector to<br>
transcribe the functionally linked expression cassette, e.g. to activate the pre-determined<br>
activity encoded by the vector, is feasible in a very simple manner. Especially the<br>
preferred inductor substance L-arabinose is in wide use for dietary purposes as well as a<br>
formulation agent for pharmaceutical preparations and, accordingly, its harmlessness in<br>
view of mammalian cells, for example cultured cells, tissue, organs or mammalian<br>
organisms is proven.<br>
Furthermore, a saccharide to be used as an inductor substance offers the advantages of<br>
being readily available at low cost and of administration by established routes, for<br>
example orally or intravenously.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical combination for<br>
controlled peptide delivery into an animal organism, e.g. into the vicinity of target cells in<br>
vivo. For this use, vectors that form the first component of the pharmaceutical system are<br>
based on non-invasive bacteria or on invasive bacteria. Synthesis of an antigenic peptide<br>
encoded by said bacterial vector is induced by application of the inductor saccharide, e.g.<br>
the pharmaceutical combination of the invention resulting in the effect of a live vaccine<br>
16<br><br>
for animals including humans. The use as vaccines can be directed to preferentially induce<br>
a cellular and/or humoral immune response, by appropriate choice of the bacterium used<br>
for the vector and on the peptide encoded by the transgene.<br>
It is a specific advantage of the present invention that the bacterial vector component of<br>
the pharmaceutical combination according to the invention can be chosen to preferentially<br>
induce a cellular and/or humoral immune response, depending on the properties of the<br>
bacterium used and/or on the properties of the peptide encoded by the transgene. In detail,<br>
it has been found that both non-invasive bacteria and invasive bacteria lead to or can be<br>
adapted to preferentially direct the immune response to a cellular or a humoral one.<br>
However, a person skilled in the art can easily determine which bacterium constitutes a<br>
suitable component for a bacterial vector in combination with the peptide encoded by the<br>
transgene in the pharmaceutical system to achieve the desired cellular and/or humoral<br>
immune response.<br>
An example for an analytical method to determine the induction of humoral immune<br>
responses in serum of recipient animals is an ELISA for antigen-specific antibodies. An<br>
example for an analytical method to determine the induction of cellular immune responses<br>
in different locations of recipient animals is the analysis of cytokine production by<br>
antigen-specific immune cells.<br>
Here, bacterial vectors that are based on non-invasive bacteria like e.g. commensal<br>
bacteria, are used for the delivery of peptide encoded under the control of the saccharide<br>
inducible promoter. Bacteria commensal to animals or humans can be used to express<br>
and/or release peptide or synthetic pathway enzymes to produce effector molecules.<br>
Effector molecules can be provided by the pharmaceutical combination of the invention<br>
using bacterial vectors expressing synthetic pathway enzymes for e.g. interleukins,<br>
leukotrienes as well as drugs obtainable from pro-drugs by enzymatic conversion. An<br>
exemplary enzyme for the conversion of a pro-drug to a more potent drug is cytosine<br>
deaminase, e.g. from E. coli.<br>
Not only are these activities of the vector induced at will by applying the inductor<br>
saccharide to the animal or human having received said vector, but further, repeated<br>
17<br><br>
activation of the transgene is possible by application of the inductor saccharide, as long as<br>
bacterial vector is present.<br>
For introducing peptide into the cells of animals treated with the pharmaceutical<br>
combination of the invention, its vector component is preferably based on attenuated<br>
invasive bacteria. Target cells are tissue or organs within an animal, i.e. in vivo, cultivated<br>
animal cells or extracorporal tissue or organs. Herein, attenuated invasive bacteria serve as<br>
a transport vehicle for introducing transgene sequences into animal cells, which transgene<br>
sequences are transcribed and/or translated by the bacterial component. Dependent on the<br>
nature of the peptide encoded by the vector, the vector is for medical use or for technical<br>
use, e.g. for manipulating cultivated target cells, e.g. for the extracorporal treatment of<br>
organs.<br>
Additionally or in the alternative, the bacterium on which the bacterial vector component<br>
is based serves to enhance the specific immune response desired against the peptide<br>
expressed, e.g. the bacterium acts as an adjuvant for antigenic peptides. In accordance with<br>
the antigenic properties of the peptide encoded by the transgene and depending on the<br>
cellular and humoral components of the immune response elicited, such a bacterial vector<br>
can constitute the first component of the pharmaceutical combination used as a vaccine<br>
against viral or bacterial infection or against parasites, tumor cells, or factors involved in<br>
autoimmunity or allergy, against Alzheimer plaques and other malignancies.<br>
Alternatively, the transgene may encode a suicide gene whose synthesis leads to lysis of<br>
the bacterial vector and subsequent release of its constituents, predominantly into the<br>
vicinity of target cells in the case of vectors based on non-invasive bacteria, and<br>
predominantly within target cells in the case of vectors based on attenuated invasive<br>
bacteria, respectively.<br>
In a further aspect, the bacterial vector component is based on non-invasive or on<br>
attenuated invasive bacteria for delivery of nucleic acids, which can be transcribed and/or<br>
translated by the recipient mammalian cell. This can be used for introducing a desired<br>
nucleic acid sequence into the vicinity of or into target cells within an animal or within an<br>
extracorporal organ. In one aspect, the vector component is used as a transport vehicle for<br>
18<br><br>
introducing exogenous nucleic acid sequences into animal organisms or cells, for example<br>
DNA comprising an expression cassette encoding a peptide homologous to the recipient<br>
mammalian cell or encoding a heterologous peptide, for example having antigenic<br>
properties to elicit an immune response from the recipient organism. The transfer of an<br>
expression cassette encoding an immunogenic peptide instead of the direct transfer of the<br>
antigen is also termed DNA vaccination.<br>
For use in vaccination, the pharmaceutical combination according to the invention allows<br>
the advantageous delivery of a transgene because the transgene can be maintained within<br>
the vector component until delivery of peptide and/or nucleic acid to the vicinity of or into<br>
the target cell essentially without activity of the transgene previous to the administration of<br>
its second component. The advantage of induction of trangene activity by administration<br>
of the inductor saccharide becomes evident when looking at the energetic burden to the<br>
bacterial vector for maintenance of a transgene within a plasmid or for continued peptide<br>
synthesis during the course of infection, reducing the efficiency of the vector component.<br>
As target cells reached by the vector component, Peyer plaques and further<br>
immunoreactive tissues of animals have been identified to contain bacterial vector after<br>
oral and systemic administration of the vector, respectively. Activation of the transgene<br>
could be achieved in these immunoreactive target cells by subsequent oral or systemic<br>
administration of the inductor saccharide.<br>
A further medical use of the pharmaceutical combination, which preferably contains a<br>
bacterial vector component, using a vector generated on the basis of non-invasive or<br>
invasive bacteria, which in the case of pathogenic bacteria are preferably attenuated, is<br>
marking, identification and/or killing of tumor cells. Here, the transgene may be a peptide<br>
which is recognized by the recipient animal as an antigen when available for presentation<br>
in complex with MHC molecules. The antigen may be heterologous peptide or a self-<br>
antigen to break self-tolerance. Marking or identification of tumor cells for subsequent<br>
elimination by CTL is an efficient way of surmounting the self-tolerance which is an<br>
obstacle to the attack of CTL against tumor cells. The complex of antigen delivered by the<br>
bacterial vector component and MHC I is then recognisable by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.<br>
This leads to the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, directed against cells presenting<br>
the immunogenic peptide on their superficial MHC I complex. When used in connection<br>
19<br><br>
with the preference of some enteropathogenic bacteria, for example salmonella or E. coli,<br>
to invade tumor tissue and replicate therein, the bacterial vector component of the<br>
pharmaceutical system directs the cellular immune response involving cytotoxic T-<br>
lymphocytes against identified cells, preferably against tumor tissue.<br>
For use in tumor therapy, the transgene contained within the bacterial vector component<br>
can be selected from nucleic acids encoding factors that suppress the expression and/or<br>
activity of oncogenes, e.g. iRNA, pro-drug converting enzymes, e.g. E. coli deaminase,<br>
cytotoxic proteins, e.g. colicin E3, immunomodulating factors, e.g. cytokines, the tumor<br>
necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and/or anti-angiogenic factors, e.g. endostatin.<br>
Synchronizing the time of administration of the inductor component with the infectious<br>
cycle or migration of the bacterial vector component within the target organism that has<br>
been administered the vector component to specific or non-specific tissues, cells and/or<br>
cellular compartments, e.g. after completion of migration into tumor tissue is expected or<br>
determined, allows to start the desired activity from the saccharide inducible promoter at<br>
desired locations.<br>
This desired activity may be the synthesis of an antigen intended for presentation on the<br>
surfaces of specific target cells, i.e. on the outside of tumor cells to mark them for<br>
recognition by T-cells. Another example for the desired activity is the synthesis of an<br>
apoptose-inducing factor, or of a peptide catalyzing the conversion of a pro-drug to a drug,<br>
resulting for example in an increased cytotoxicity of the drug compared to the pro-drug. A<br>
further desired transgene activity may be the synthesis of bacterial toxins, e.g. cytotoxins.<br>
These bacterial vector components preferentially comprise a transgene encoding a peptide,<br>
the expression of which within the infected tumor cell induces apoptosis or lysis by<br>
cytotoxic T-cells. For diagnostic or research purposes, tumor tissue can be identified by<br>
introduction of an expression cassette containing a product that can be identified<br>
spectrometrically, for example a fluorescent or bioluminescent peptide or peptide<br>
catalyzing the conversion of a compound to generate a detectable signal, e.g. a<br>
magnetosome or luminescence.<br>
20<br><br>
As a further embodiment of the invention, the bacterial vector component is genetically<br>
manipulated for enhanced expression of the inductor saccharide transporter system<br>
importing the inductor saccharide into the vector. This genetic manipulation can be<br>
effected by enhancement of the basal promoter activity controlling expression of the<br>
inductor saccharide transporter system or, alternatively, by introduction of the expression<br>
cassette encoding the inductor saccharide transporter system, e.g. into bacteria used as<br>
vectors that originally are devoid of an inductor saccharide transporter system for the<br>
inductor saccharide suitable for inducing activity of the saccharide inducible promoter<br>
controlling activity of the transgene. For example, the expression cassette encoding the L-<br>
arabinose transporter of E. coli is used to transform a bacterium lacking an L-arabinose<br>
transporter.<br>
As a result, increased uptake of the inductor saccharide by bacterial vectors is observed,<br>
leading to enhanced induction of transgene activity. Further, the percentage of bacterial<br>
vector present that is induced is increased, reducing the effect of the so-called all-or-<br>
nothing effect that is observed at inductor saccharide concentrations in tissue below a<br>
saturating level, e.g. at medium range concentrations, leading to a considerable proportion<br>
of bacterial vector without inductor saccharide, i.e. essentially without transgene activity.<br>
As an example, chromosomal or plasmid-based integration of a mutant lacY gene into a<br>
bacterial vector that is deficient for L-arabinose transport and/or degradation (e.g.<br>
according to Morgan-Kiss et al., PNAS 99, 7373-7377 (2002)) can be used as a genetic<br>
manipulation to enhance L-arabinose uptake and, hence, induction of the saccharide<br>
inducible promoter, in this example PBAD-<br>
In addition or in the alternative to the embodiment of using a genetically manipulated<br>
bacterial vector having increased activity of the inductor saccharide transporter, the<br>
bacterial vector is genetically manipulated for reduction of the metabolic pathway activity<br>
of inductor saccharide degradation. In these embodiments, genetic manipulation of the<br>
bacteria used as the bacterial vector component leads to reduction or inactivation of<br>
transcription and/or translation and/or activity of metabolic enzymes. For example,<br>
synthesis of metabolic enzymes of the L-arabinose degradation pathway (ara operon) is<br>
inactivated in the bacterial vector component.<br>
21<br><br>
The genetic manipulation to increase uptake of inductor saccharide and/or to reduce<br>
inductor saccharide metabolism is preferred in bacterial vectors that are not intended for<br>
repeated administration of inductor saccharide., e.g. when complete and intense induction<br>
of transgene activity is desired, e.g. lysis of the vector component when using gene E as<br>
the transgene for termination of presence of the vector.<br>
The specificity of the bacterial vector component originates from the properties of the<br>
bacterium utilized as the first component of the pharmaceutical combination, whereas it is<br>
the second component that achieves controlled induction of the presence and, hence,<br>
activity of the transgene. Making use of the control of the vector component by<br>
administration of the inductor saccharide allows to determine, if desired repeatedly, the<br>
point of time of activation, e.g. transcription and, depending on the transgene, translation<br>
of the transgene. On the basis of identification of vector component within the animal or<br>
after lapse of a period of time the vector component needs for reaching a desired location,<br>
the spatial localisation of the vector component is utilized to achieve a spatial, i.e. a<br>
localized effect from the transgene. In this embodiment, a bacterial vector component may<br>
be used to direct the cellular immune response towards target cells displaying the antigen<br>
by MHC I, e.g. tumor cells containing the antigenic peptide originally encoded by the<br>
bacterial vector. In this regard, the bacterial component of the vector can provide adjuvant<br>
activity and serves for identification of tumor cells and localisation of the transgene<br>
activity.<br>
The saccharide inducible promoter contained within the bacterial vector component allows<br>
for an infection of animal cells unhampered by transcription and/or translation of<br>
structural sequences and/or by a high copy number of the plasmid, due to the tight<br>
regulation exerted by this promoter in the absence of inductor saccharide. It is only after<br>
the external administration of the inductor saccharide at any desired point of time that the<br>
desired transgene activity commences, e.g. transcription starts from the promoter.<br>
An example for the second embodiment is the use of the pharmaceutical combination<br>
against inflammatory bowel disease, comprising a vector component based on commensal<br>
bacteria containing a transgene encoding for example interleukins, leukotrienes etc., or<br>
synthetic pathway enzymes to produce effector molecules. This bacterial vector<br>
22<br><br>
component may be introduced into the target organism by ingestion and the synthesis of<br>
effector molecules may be induced repeatedly by subsequent ingestion of the relevant<br>
inductor component.<br>
The transgene may encode structural genes (antigenic or immunomodulating peptide,<br>
antibody or bioluminescent peptide, toxins, e.g. bacteriostatics and/or cytostatics, enzymes<br>
modifying bacterial nucleic acids, e.g. bacterial recombinases, e.g. for altering the<br>
transgene sequence), reactive RNA species (ribozyme, antisense RNA, siRNA), a<br>
replicase for the amplification of plasmids (the trfA gene product of E. coli, acting on<br>
oriV) and/or lysis determinant of a bacteriophage (lytic peptide from suicide gene, e.g.<br>
protein E of 0X174).<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the transgene under the control of a saccharide inducible<br>
promoter may be used to control the copy number of the bacterial plasmid on which it is<br>
contained. For example, the transgene may encode a replicase acting on a high copy<br>
number origin of replication. Presence of the inductor saccharide leads to the synthesis of<br>
the transgene, which in turn acts on its specific origin of replication, leading to the<br>
amplification of the entire plasmid sequence. Due to the tight regulation of the inventive<br>
promoter element, such a plasmid furthermore comprises a very low copy number origin<br>
of replication in order to maintain at least one copy of the plasmid within the bacterial<br>
vector in the absence of inductor. The plasmid may comprise a further nucleic acid<br>
sequence, for example an expression cassette, optionally also under the control of a<br>
saccharide inducible promoter, encoding a structural gene or a reactive RNA species.<br>
In order to enhance the import of nucleic acid sequences into the cellular nucleus,<br>
enhancer elements for nuclear import can be present on such nucleic acid sequences, for<br>
example the cPPT region, (poly purine tract, a genetic element enhancing nuclear import).<br>
Further transgenes which can be encoded by bacterial vector components may additionally<br>
or alternatively encode a suicide gene under the control of the saccharide inducible<br>
promoter. Such a suicide gene catalyzes the lysis of the bacterial vector component and<br>
may be represented for example by the lysis gene of phage OX 174, gene E. The presence<br>
of a transgene encoding a suicide gene is only possible under the control of a tightly<br>
23<br><br>
regulated promoter as the lysis of the bacterial vector is induced by the synthesis of only a<br>
few molecules, for example of less the 100 molecules of gene E product. Therefore,<br>
presence of the inductor saccharide leading to the synthesis of the suicide gene product<br>
results in the rapid destruction of the bacterial vector component and in the release of its<br>
contents into the phagosome, the cellular cytosol and/or into the intercellular space.<br>
Accordingly, a suicide gene under control of a saccharide inducible promoter can be used<br>
for genetically manipulated bacterial vector components as a safety feature for aborting<br>
their presence and for the release of the bacterial content.<br>
In order to destroy the phagosome in the case of intracellular bacteria replicating therein,<br>
the bacterial vector component may be genetically manipulated to comprise a transgene<br>
for secretion of a peptide leading to the destruction of the phagosome, for example<br>
listeriolysin O (LLO). The peptide leading to the destruction of the phagosome may be<br>
activated by administration of the inductor component. This phagosomal lysis facilitates<br>
the liberation of the bacterial vector's contents into the cytosol, which allows access of<br>
peptides for presentation via MHC-I and/or the nuclear import of nucleic acid sequences<br>
into the cellular nucleus.<br>
A further example for a structural gene to be used as the transgene are sequences encoding<br>
peptides useful for research, monitoring and diagnostic purposes, for example green<br>
fluorescent protein and its homologues or derivatives, luciferase or the lux operon (lux<br>
CD ABE) ofPhotorhabdus luminescens for detection of luminescence, for example by a<br>
CCD camera, or via enzymatic activity generating a dye, e.g. beta-galactosidase.<br>
Further examples of transgenes are secretory proteins, conjugational DNA-protein<br>
complexes, bacteriolytic determinants or bacteriophage for release of macromolecules<br>
from the vector within the tissue, organ or animal upon induction by administration of<br>
inductor saccharide. Secretion systems usable for secretion of transcription and/or<br>
translation products of the transgene or of DNA, respectively, are for example bacterial<br>
secretion systems and, alternatively, bacteriophages and lysis systems, modified for the<br>
transfer and/or release of macromolecules from the bacterial vector. Secretion systems<br>
comprise type I secretion systems like the E.coli hemolysin secretion system, which be<br>
adapted to the saccharide regulated secretion of peptide by generation of transgene<br>
24<br><br>
encoding a fusion peptide containing the secretory recognition sequence. Similarly, the<br>
general secretion pathway (Sec) of E. coli, classified as type II secretion system, and type<br>
III secretion systems, e.g. E.coli flagella type III secretion system or pathogenicity related<br>
type III secretion systems of Salmonella can be adapted by the generation of a transgene<br>
encoding a fusion peptide with the respective signal peptide. One specific use of the type<br>
III secretion systems is the translocation of peptide from extracellular bacteria into target<br>
cells or from bacteria residing in intracellular compartments of the host cell into the<br>
cytosol. Further, type IV secretion systems, also refered to as conjugational apparatuses,<br>
e.g. the VirB/VirD4 type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, can be<br>
adapted for secretion and/or translocation of peptide and/or DNA by providing the<br>
transgene with a nucleic acid sequence encoding the respective signal sequence specific to<br>
the secretion system. One specific use of type IV secretion systems is the translocation of<br>
peptide and/or DNA from extracellular bacteria into target cells or from intracellular<br>
bacteria across cellular compartmental borders, according to the invention within the<br>
animal after induction by administration of the inductor saccharide. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, autotransporter and other surface-display systems, e.g. the E.coli AID A<br>
autotransporter, can be used as transgene. Bacteriophages, e.g. phages Lambda or Ml3,<br>
can be used as a transgene, effecting their release from the bacterial cell upon induction by<br>
the inductor saccharide. Whereas the release of Lambda phage requires bacterial cell lysis,<br>
the filamentous phage Ml3 can be secreted by the viable bacterial cell. Lysis<br>
determinants, e.g. protein E of bacteriophage phiX174 or protein Hok of plasmid Rl, can<br>
be used as transgenes for lysis of the bacterial vector giving rise to the release of peptide<br>
and/or nucleic acid from the bacterial vector.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the bacterial vector component is genetically<br>
manipulated to enhance the activity of its intrinsic secretory system to increase secretion<br>
of a transcription or translation product of the transgene upon administration of the<br>
inductor saccharide. Alternatively, the bacterial vector component is genetically<br>
manipulated to comprise a chromosomal or plasmid-based expression cassette encoding a<br>
secretory system for the enhancement of secretion of the transcription or translation<br>
product of the transgene. For these purposes, the above mentioned secretion systems type I<br>
to IV can be used.<br>
25<br><br>
Bacteria that can form the basis for the vector component of the pharmaceutical<br>
combination according to the invention comprise artificial bacteria carrying substantial<br>
deletions in comparison to wild-type strains and/or comprising genetic determinants of<br>
several different bacteria as long as they still provide for the function of the bacterial<br>
vector component in the combination according to the present invention, and attenuated<br>
strains of non-pathogenic or pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria which<br>
may be invasive or non-invasive to animal cells, or commensal bacteria. The gram-<br>
negative bacteria are for example E. coli, Salmonella spp., e.g. Salmonella enterica<br>
serovar Typhimurium, like strain SL7207, e.g. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, like<br>
strain Ty21a, Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., and Vibrio cholerae. Examples for gram-<br>
positive bacteria are Bacillus spp., e.g. Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium spp., Listerium<br>
monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium spp., e.g. strain BCG. Commensal bacteria are for<br>
example E. coli, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Streptococcus gordonii.<br>
Within the terms of this disclosure, the expression "attenuated invasive bacteria"<br>
especially refers to attenuated strains of E. coli, Listerium monocytogenes, Salmonella<br>
enterica var. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and attenuated<br>
strains of further invasive bacteria as well as of the non-invasive bacterium Vibrio<br>
cholerae. The reason for including Vibrio cholerae for the purposes of this disclosure<br>
within the term "invasive bacteria" is that for Vibrio cholerae attenuated strains exist,<br>
which have been demonstrated to accumulate within tumor tissue (Nature Biotechnology,<br>
Volume 22, No 3, March 2004). With reference to the affinity of Vibrio cholerae to<br>
tumors this is a property shared with at least some invasive bacteria, making them useful<br>
within the present invention.<br>
In the context of this disclosure, the classification of bacteria useful as the bacterial vector<br>
components of the invention as invasive or non-invasive includes the possibility for some<br>
bacteria to colonize organ specific tissue intracellularly and extracellularly. This applies<br>
for example to Salmonella, that colonize tumor tissue also in an extracellular state.<br>
Further, invasive bacteria can be used to generate the vector component of the invention<br>
which originally are non-invasive bacteria but which have been rendered invasive by<br>
genetic manipulation, e.g. by introduction of coding sequences for invasion promoting<br>
26<br><br>
factors, e.g. the invasin gene (inv) derived from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, e.g. by<br>
expression in E. coli.<br>
Further exemplary bacteria suitable for producing the bacterial vector component of the<br>
pharmaceutical combination according to the invention are: Agrobacterium e.g.<br>
Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Bacillus e.g. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus<br>

Examples<br>
In the examples, the promoter element PBAD from the L-arabinose operon of E. coli, is<br>
present on one plasmid and/or on a DNA segment integrated at least in single copy into<br>
the bacterial vector's chromosome in combination with the structural gene for its regulator<br>
protein AraC under control of its own promoter Pc. However, the promoter element PBAD<br>
is only representative for saccharide inducible promoters to be used according to the<br>
invention in genetically manipulated bacterial vectors.<br>
An arrangement of the saccharide inducible promoter PBAD with an expression cassette for<br>
its specific regulator AraC is shown in the Figure 1, wherein the saccharide inducible<br>
promoter is arranged in a back to back relationship with the promoter Pc controlling the<br>
structural gene for its regulator AraC. This arrangement is not obligatory, however, it is<br>
essential that the expression cassette for the regulator gene is physically linked to the<br>
saccharide inducible promoter, and the arrangement of the operator elements should allow<br>
for the insertion of the desired DNA sequences downstream, i.e. in an operably linked<br>
fashion.<br>
30<br><br>
Example 1: Expression of peptide from a plasmid contained in the bacterial vector after<br>
induction<br>
As an example for a structural gene, plasmid pHL238 (schematically depicted in Figure 1)<br>
comprising the structural gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of<br>
PBAD was cloned, further comprising the structural gene for the regulator of PBAD, araC<br>
under the control of its own promoter Pc, along with the Ampicillin resistance gene as a<br>
selection marker, and a high copy number origin of replication from pUC. Regulatory<br>
elements originate from plasmid pBAD18 (Guzman et al., J. Bacteriol 1995 Jul;<br>
177(14):4121-30)<br>
This bacterial vector is based on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, strain<br>
SL7207, which is a known attenuated invasive salmonella strain in use for experimental<br>
vaccination.<br>
The salmonella strain was transformed with plasmid pHL238 by electroporation,<br>
transformed colonies were selected on LB-medium agar plates containing streptomycin at<br>
30 ug/mL and ampicillin at 100 ug/mL. The resultant transformed strain was bacterial<br>
vector SL7207[pHL238]. At 3 hours after addition of 0.1 % w/vol L-arabinose to the<br>
bacterial culture in liquid LB medium (30 ug/mL streptomycin, 100 ug/mL ampicillin) at<br>
logarithmic growth phase, strong induction of GFP expression was monitored using a<br>
FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Results are shown in Figure 2, the thick<br>
line for addition of L-arabinose, the thin line without L-arabinose.<br>
These measurements demonstrate that the synthesis of the gene product under the control<br>
of a saccharide inducible promoter by addition of the saccharide acting as its specific<br>
inductor substance leads to the bacterial expression of the structural gene. In this example,<br>
the expression of GFP leads to fluorescence values more than two orders above the<br>
background fluorescence obtained for the infected cells without induction by L-arabinose.<br>
31<br><br>
Example 2: in vitro expression of peptide from a bacterial vector after induction within<br>
infected animal cells<br>
The murine macrophage cell line J774A1 was infected with bacterial vector<br>
SL7207[pHL238] of Example 1. Before infection, cells were seeded to 2 x 106 cells per<br>
well in a 6-well plate in antibiotic-free medium (IMDM with 10% inactivated fetal calf<br>
serum, 2 mM glutamine) and grown for one day in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. For<br>
infection, SL7207[pHL238] were grown from a glycerol stock overnight at 37°C on a LB<br>
plate supplemented with anitibiotics, followed by cultivation in liquid LB medium<br>
supplemented with antibiotics for approximately 2 hours at 37°C, shaking at 60 rpm.<br>
Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS, resuspended in cell culture<br>
medium and added at a ~MOI of 10. 30 min after start of infection cells were washed<br>
twice with PBS before medium containing gentamycin (50 ug/mL) was added to kill<br>
extracellular bacteria. 4 hours after infection different amounts of L-arabinose were added<br>
into individual wells of infected J774A.1 cells up to final concentrations in of 800 uM, 4<br>
mM, 40 mM, and 400 mM. 3 hours after addition of L-arabinose cells were treated with<br>
0,25% Triton X-100. GFP expressing bacteria in the lysates were monitored by flow<br>
cytometry. In order to differentiate fluorescence of GFP expressing bacteria from<br>
autofluorescent cell fragments the so-called two colour flow cytometry method was used<br>
(Bumann, Infect. Immun. (2001) 69,4618-4626.). The analytical results are depicted in<br>
Figure 3, with unspecific background fluorescence substracted. Varying L-arabinose<br>
concentrations are depicted for medium without L-arabinose (thin curve) and L-arabinose<br>
at increasing concentrations at 4 mM, 40 mM and 400mM (curves with increasing<br>
boldness).<br>
It can be seen that the fluorescence intensity of GFP increases with increasing<br>
concentrations of L-arabinose in the medium, demonstrating the gradual induction of the<br>
saccharide inducible promoter, leading to the synthesis of GFP.<br>
These measurements demonstrate that the introduction of a bacterial vector into<br>
mammalian cells is obtained using the bacterial vector according to the invention, and<br>
induction of the synthesis of the gene product under the control of a saccharide inducible<br>
promoter by extracellular addition of the saccharide acting as its specific inductor<br>
32<br><br>
substance leads to the bacterial expression of the structural gene while contained in animal<br>
cells.<br>
Example 3: in vivo expression of peptide from a bacterial vector after induction within a<br>
mammalian organism<br>
Balb/c mice were infected intravenously with a dose of ca. 5 x 106 bacteria in PBS of<br>
bacterial vector SL7207[pHL238]. After 2 days, different amounts of L-arabinose<br>
dissolved in PBS were administered intravenously into mice. 4 hours after L-arabinose<br>
administration mice were sacrificed, spleens were removed, homogenized in PBS<br>
containing 0,1% Triton X-100 and lysates were analyzed by two colour flow cytometry.<br>
It is demonstrated that expression of GFP by bacteria recovered from the infected animals<br>
was induced by L-Arabinose in a dose-dependent manner, results are depicted in Figure 4.<br>
It is seen that the fluorescence intensity due to GFP increases with increasing<br>
concentrations of L-arabinose in the animal, demonstrating the gradual induction of the<br>
saccharide inducible promoter, leading to the synthesis of GFP.<br>
Example 4: In vitro regulation of copy number of a bacterial plasmid<br>
In order to demonstrate the regulation of the copy number of a plasmid contained within a<br>
bacterial vector, the plasmid according to Figure 5 was constructed. In the absence of L-<br>
arabinose, just one copy of this plasmid per bacterial cell is maintained, regulated by the<br>
origin of replication derived from the F plasmid of Escherichia coli. In addition, this<br>
plasmid contains the inducible origin of replication of plasmid RK2, namely oriV. The<br>
replicase gene trfA, acting on this origin, is placed under the control of PBAD, as an<br>
example for a saccharide inducible promoter.<br>
In order to allow for a convenient analysis of plasmid replication, GFP was placed under<br>
control of the weak constitutive Pwa promoter derived from the bla gene, also contained on<br>
said vector. The recombinant strain SL7207[pAEN17] was grown into logarithmic phase<br>
and either no or 0,1% L-Arabinose was added into bacterial cultures. After 3 hours of<br>
induction, plasmid replication was monitored by measuring increased GFP activity due to<br>
33<br><br>
increased expression, which in turn was caused by plasmid amplification containing gfp<br>
gene copies, as depicted in Figure 6.<br>
The results demonstrate that the addition of L-arabinose induces the PBAD, leading to the<br>
synthesis of the trfA gene product, which in turn induces replication mediated by oriV,<br>
resulting in an increased copy number of the plasmid pAEN17. The analytical results of<br>
flow cytometry are shown in Figure 6 with background fluorescence as the left-hand peak,<br>
representing the expression of GFP at low copy number under non-induced conditions.<br>
The right-hand peak represents the activity of GFP under induced conditions, indicating<br>
the effect of the increased copy number of the plasmid and of the expression cassette for<br>
GFP, respectively. This demonstrates that a saccharide inducible promoter can be used to<br>
control the copy number of a plasmid harboured by a bacterial vector when placing the<br>
coding sequence for the gene acting on an inducible origin of replication functionally<br>
linked under the control of a saccharide inducible promoter.<br>
Example 5: In vitro induction of plasmid replication to control protein expression from a<br>
bacterial vector within mammalian cells<br>
J774A1 cells, a murine macrophage cell line, were infected with strain SL7207[pAEN17],<br>
as described in Example 2. 4 hours after infection, different amounts of L-arabinose were<br>
added into individual wells of infected J774A1 cells up to a concentration in the medium<br>
of 4 mM, 40 mM and 400mM, respectively. 3 hours after addition of L-arabinose cells<br>
were treated with 0,25% Triton X-100. Bacteria in the lysates were monitored for GFP<br>
expression by flow cytometry as described in Example 2. The analytical results are<br>
depicted in Figure 7, with unspecific background fluorescence substracted.<br>
It is seen that the fluorescence intensity of GFP increases with increasing concentrations of<br>
L-arabinose in the medium, demonstrating the gradual induction of the saccharide<br>
inducible promoter, leading to induction of plasmid replication and in turn to an increase<br>
in the synthesis of GFP due to elevated gene copy number.<br>
These measurements demonstrate that the introduction of a bacterial vector into<br>
mammalian cells is obtained using the bacterial vector according to the invention, and<br>
34<br><br>
induction of the synthesis of the replicase TrfA under the control of a saccharide inducible<br>
promoter by extracellular addition of the saccharide acting as its specific inductor<br>
substance leads to the amplification of the plasmid containing a constitutive expression<br>
cassette of the structural gene while contained in animal cells.<br>
Example 6: In vitro induction of lysis of bacterial vector within a mammalian organism<br>
In order to demonstrate the lysis of bacterial vectors according to the invention,<br>
controllable by addition of the inductor saccharide for the saccharide inducible promoter, a<br>
plasmid according to Figure 8 was constructed. This plasmid carries the lysis gene E of<br>
bacteriophage O XI74 under the control of the saccharide inducible promoter PBAD,<br>
demonstrating the strict regulation of PBAD in the non-induced state. The plasmid pHL241<br>
shown in Figure 8 was derived from plasmid pHL238 shown in Figure 1 by exchanging<br>
gene gfp against gene E.<br>
For infection, J774A1 cells were cultured and infected with SL7207 bearing the plasmid<br>
of Figure 8 according to the procedure of Example 2. Induction was by addition of L-<br>
arabinose to the final concentrations in cell culture medium as given in Figure 9, for an<br>
induction period of 3 hours. Following induction, cells were harvested and lysed by<br>
addition of Triton X-100 to a concentration of 1 g/L. For re-isolation, intracellular<br>
bacterial vectors were plated on LB-agar containing ampicillin for quantification of viable<br>
bacteria as colony forming units (CFU).<br>
The results depicted in Figure 9 show that presence of the inductor saccharide L-arabinose<br>
drastically decreases the number of viable bacterial vectors inside infected J774A1 cells.<br>
The number of viable bacteria which can be re-isolated from infected J774A1 cells is<br>
reduced by presence of L-arabinose as a result of lysis of the bacterial vector caused by<br>
synthesis of the gene E product.<br>
This example shows the effectiveness of bacterial vectors according to the invention,<br>
based on attenuated invasive bacteria, containing a saccharide inducible promoter in<br>
combination with a suicide gene as a system for terminating the infection of mammalian<br>
cells with invasive attenuated bacteria by controlled lysis. This controlled termination of<br>
35<br><br>
the infection inevitably leads to the release of the bacterial vector contents into the<br>
phagosome or cytosol of the infected cell, respectively.<br>
Example 7: In vivo inducible lysis of bacterial vectors within an infected mammalian<br>
organism<br>
This example demonstrates the applicability of the attenuated invasive bacteria containing<br>
a saccharide inducible promoter controlling a suicide gene for terminating the infection of<br>
cells within a mammal, i.e. a mouse. The lysis gene E of bacteriophage 0X174 was<br>
contained on the plasmid of Figure 8, harboured within Salmonella strain SL7207. This<br>
bacterial vector was intravenously injected into Balb/c mice as described in Example 3.<br>
Two days after infection of mice, L-arabinose was injected intravenously in amounts of 60<br>
mg, 8 mg and 1.6 mg per animal, saline solution was used as background control (0).<br>
Following 4 hours after induction, animals were sacrificed and the spleen was<br>
homogenized for determination of the number of viable bacterial vectors. Viable bacterial<br>
vectors were counted after plating according to Example 6.<br>
The results depicted in Figure 10 demonstrate that the activity of the saccharide inducible<br>
promoter contained in attenuated invasive bacteria according to the invention can be<br>
induced in vivo by the systemic application of inductor substance. Injection of the inductor<br>
saccharide leads to the activation of the saccharide inducible promoter PBAD, resulting in<br>
expression of gene E and, subsequently, in an efficient lysis of the bacterial vector. Results<br>
furthermore nicely demonstrate that the activity of the saccharide inducible promoter can<br>
be regulated in a gradual manner by variation of the saccharide concentration acting as the<br>
inductor.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 further show that regulation of the toxic gene under the control of the<br>
saccharide inducible promoter is sufficiently tight to allow for the maintenance of the<br>
respective plasmid, encoding a toxic gene product, within bacterial vectors.<br>
Example 8: In vivo induction of transgene activity from bacterial vector within a tumor of<br>
an animal<br>
36<br><br>
This example demonstrates the use of a pharmaceutical combination of a bacterial vector<br>
with the inductor saccharide to induce a transgene activity within an animal, with<br>
preference to tumor tissue.<br>
As a representative for a transgene, the luciferase gene from the firefly Photinus pyralis<br>
was used as the reporter gene. As the saccharide inducible promoter element, PBAD from<br>
the L-arabinose operon of E. coli was functionally linked to the luciferase gene, the<br>
promoter element further being in conjunction with the structural gene for its regulator<br>
protein araC under the control of its natural own promoter (Pc). The bacterial vector was<br>
generated by transforming Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, vaccine strain<br>
SL7207, with the plasmid containing the transgene under the control of the saccharide<br>
inducible promoter by electroporation. This plasmid, termed pHL259 is schematically<br>
shown in Figure 11.<br>
As an example for an animal having a tumor, Balb/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated<br>
abdominally with 106 cells of the colon adenocarcinoma cell line CT26. After this tumor<br>
generation treatment, mice bearing tumors of approximately 400-600 mm3 were<br>
intravenously injected with 5 x 106 bacteria of the above bacterial vector<br>
(SL7207[pHL259]), representing the first component of the pharmaceutical combination,<br>
suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Three days post infection, L-arabinose as<br>
the appropriate inductor saccharide, representing the second component of the<br>
pharmaceutical combination, was administered intraperitoneally, dissolved in PBS.<br>
Subsequently, mice were sacrificed and the tumors, spleens and livers dissected, then<br>
transferred into 3 mL of sterile, ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100.<br>
In order to determine the distribution of the vector component within the animal organism<br>
as well as the induction of the transgene activity due to the administration of the second<br>
component, tumor tissue, spleens and livers were analysed.<br>
Tissues were disrupted in a Polytron PG3000 homogenizer (Kinematica, Littau,<br>
Switzerland). Homogenates were diluted in PBS and streaked on medium plates with<br>
selective antibiotic (ampicillin). Colonies were counted after incubation of plates. As a<br>
37<br><br>
result, the number of bacteria in respective tissues could be calculated by counting the<br>
resulting colony forming units (cfu) for each organ. The results are shown in Figure 12 A.<br>
The induction of the transgene was determined by measurement of the reporter gene<br>
(luciferase) activity from tissue homogenates after dilution (1:1) in 2x luciferase assay<br>
lysis buffer (50 mM tris-HCl, 4 mM DTT, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 2% (vol/vol) Triton X-<br>
100, 2 mg/mL lysozyme, pH 8.3), incubation at 25 °C for 10 minutes, centrifugation at<br>
3,000 x g for 3 minutes, lOuL supernatant were added to lOOmL LARII reagent of the<br>
luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega,<br>
Mannheim, Germany). Luminescence intensity was measured spectrometrically in a<br>
luminometer (Lumat LB9507, Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany). Dilution was taken into<br>
account when calculating RLU per organ.<br>
The transgene activity, represented by the luciferase activity (RLU) is shown in Figure 12<br>
B, and relative transgene activity is shown in Figure 12 C, i.e. the relative luminescence<br>
per colony forming units (RLU/cfu).<br>
For all animals, the number of bacteria found in tumors by far exceeded the number of<br>
bacteria detected in the spleen or liver, over the course of time. Here, the preference of the<br>
bacterial vector component for accumulation in tumor tissue can be seen.<br>
As can be taken from Figures 12 B and 12 C, the administration of the second component,<br>
namely L-arabinose, induces transgene expression for all tissues tested. For the tissues<br>
tested here, absolute transgene activity was greatest in tumor tissue, with the main activity<br>
at about 6 hours past administration of the inductor saccharide. Note that transgene<br>
activity in spleen and liver was very low to about background levels, and even presence of<br>
the inductor saccharide did not cause significant activity levels.<br>
Further, relative transgene activity, i.e. in relation to bacterial numbers in the tissues<br>
tested, as shown in Figure 12 C, demonstrates that transgene activity was most effectively<br>
induced in tumor tissue, whereas spleen and liver show considerably lower levels of<br>
relative transgene expression at the intervals tested after administration of the inductor<br>
saccharide.<br>
38<br><br>
Further, this example demonstrates that transgene induction is transient and, accordingly,<br>
can be repeated by repetition of the administration of the inductor saccharide, and further<br>
demonstrates that transgene induction can be modulated by the amount of inductor<br>
saccharide and, i.e. transgene activity is inductor saccharide concentration dependent.<br>
Example 9: In vivo induction of transgene activity from bacterial vector within a mammal,<br>
using the pharmaceutical combination as a vaccine<br>
Balb/c mice were orally inoculated with 5 x 108 cfu of recombinant strain<br>
SL7207[pHL259], which was obtained as described in Example 8. At day 6 after<br>
administration of the bacterial vector, mice were separated into groups, one group<br>
receiving drinking water containing 250 mg/mL L-arabinose for 24 hours as the inductor<br>
saccharide; a second group received drinking water, identically containing L-arabinose for<br>
6 hours and a third group received a total of<br>
120 mg L-arabinose, dissolved in PBS, intraperitoneally. 6 hours after administration of<br>
the inductor saccharide, mice were sacrificed and Peyer patches were isolated and<br>
homogenated.<br>
From homogenates of Peyer patches, bacterial numbers and transgene activity (luciferase)<br>
was determined as described in Example 8. Results are shown in Figures 13 A, 13 B, and<br>
13 C, demonstrating that oral administration of the bacterial vector component, followed<br>
by oral administration of the inductor saccharide is sufficient to induce transgene<br>
expression in Peyer patches, representing an immune inductive site.<br>
Example 10: Use of a pharmaceutical composition for the delivery of nucleic acid and/or<br>
protein to tumor tissue within animals<br>
As an example for a bacterial vector containing a transgene that can be activated to initiate<br>
lysis of the bacterial vector within an animal, strain SL7207 was genetically manipulated<br>
by integrating part of plasmid HL260a (schematically shown in Figure 14) by Tn7 mini-<br>
transposon-mediated site specific integration into the bacterial chromosome, essentially<br>
39<br><br>
according to Bao et al. (Gene 109,167-168 (1991)), containing gene E of bacteriophage<br>
phiX174 under the control of the PBAD promoter.<br>
As an example for animals, mice were used that had been implanted subcutanously with a<br>
CT26 tumor as described in Example 8. As the first component of the pharmaceutical<br>
combination according to the invention, recombinant strain SL7207::HL260a, containing<br>
the Tn7 mediated chromosomally integrated copy of the transgene (gene E), was<br>
administered by intravenous injection (5 x 106 bacteria in PBS). At 3 days subsequent to<br>
the administration of the bacterial vector, the second component, namely 120 mg L-<br>
arabinose dissolved in PBS, was administered by intraperitoneal injection, followed by an<br>
identical second injection 12 hours later. At 6 hours after the second administration of<br>
inductor saccharide, mice were sacrificed and their tumor tissue, spleens and livers<br>
isolated and homogenized as described in Example 8, including the determination of<br>
bacterial numbers from homogenates. Results are shown in Figure 15, showing bacterial<br>
counts of animals having received mock inductor, namely PBS (black columns) and<br>
animals having received administration of the inductor saccharide (white columns), for<br>
tumor tissue, spleen and liver, respectively. These results demonstrate that administration<br>
of the inductor saccharide lead to lysis of the bacterial vector, especially in tumor tissue,<br>
where bacterial vector had predominantly localized and/or increased in number, at least in<br>
relation to spleen and liver.<br>
This example demonstrates that a lysis gene as a transgene may be used for liberation of<br>
bacterial vector's contents, e.g. nucleic acid, protein, for delivery to tissue within an<br>
animal, controlled by administration of the second component of the pharmaceutical<br>
combination. Further, a lysis gene as a transgene may be used for a drastic reduction of<br>
bacterial vector concentration, even in most intensely populated tissue, e.g. tumor tissue.<br>
In this respect, repeated lysis of the bacterial vector by repeated administration of the<br>
inductor saccharide is feasible, as concentrations of inductor saccharide can be adjusted to<br>
avoid lysis of the complete number of bacterial vector, i.e. leave some bacterial vectors for<br>
repopulation of tissue, again, predominantly of tumor tissue.<br>
Example 11: Genetic manipulation of bacterial vector component to enhance transgene<br>
activity<br>
40<br><br>
The bacterial vector obtained in Example 10 was modified in a first alternative by T7-<br>
mediated chromosomal integration of a mini-transposon comprising the mutant lacY gene<br>
and, in a second alternative, by inactivating the ara operon by site-directed insertional<br>
mutagenesis.<br>
When using the alternatively manipulated vectors for the tumor treatment in mice<br>
according to Example 10, both vector alternatives demonstrate a similar colonization of<br>
tumor tissue in combination with an enhancement of reduction in residual vector counts<br>
following administration of the inductor saccharide, i.e. increased efficiency in transgene<br>
activity induction.<br>
Example 12: Comparison of different bacteria for generating the bacterial vector<br>
component in relation to the efficiency in colonizing a tumor of an animal<br>
For an evaluation of the suitability of bacteria for generating the bacterial vector<br>
component for use in the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, the E.<br>
coli SI laboratory strain Top 10 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), Salmonella enterica<br>
serovar Typhimurium SL7207 (SL7207, described by Hoiseth et al, Nature 291 238-239<br>
(1981)), and Salmonella enterica strains Salmoporc and Suisaloral (IDT, Rofllau,<br>
Germany) were transformed by electroporation with plasmid pHL259, encoding luciferase<br>
as a reporter gene.<br>
Mice bearing CT26 tumors as described in Example 8 were administered the bacterial<br>
vector by subcutaneous injection (5 x 106 bacteria) in PBS. 3 days later, the inductor<br>
saccharide<br>
(120 mg L-arabinose in PBS) was administered by intraperitoneal injection. 6 hours later,<br>
mice were sacrificed and tumor tissue, spleen and liver removed and analyzed for bacterial<br>
vector content and transgene activity after homogenization according to Example 8.<br>
The results obtained for the different bacterial vectors under otherwise identical conditions<br>
are shown in Figures 16 A and B for efficiency in colonizing the tissue (cfu) and<br>
efficiency of transgene activity (RLU), respectively. The results show that different<br>
41<br><br>
bacterial strains can be used to generate the bacterial vector component of the<br>
pharmaceutical combination according to the invention, yielding variations in the<br>
efficiency of colonization (cfu) of tumor tissue in relation to spleen and liver, as well as<br>
different efficiencies in transgene activity (RLU) in tumor tissue in relation to spleen and<br>
liver.<br>
It can be seen that all bacterial vectors predominantly colonized tumor tissue, although<br>
with differing efficiency. Administration of inductor saccharide caused transgene activity,<br>
again predominantly confined to tumor tissue. However, efficiency of colonization of<br>
tumor tissue was not correlated to transgene activation for all vectors.<br>
When monitoring the general health status of the animals tested, it was found that the<br>
bacterial vector based on E. coli Top 10 caused the least pronounced impairment.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a choice of vectors for use in the<br>
pharmaceutical combination of components to select a bacterial vector which<br>
predominantly accumulates in tumor tissue, and the transgene activity can be regulated by<br>
administration of the inductor saccharide, depending inter alia on the bacterium the vector<br>
is based on.<br>
Further, this example provides an assay for identification of bacteria suitable for<br>
generating the bacterial vector component of the invention, using re-isolation of bacteria<br>
from tissue samples of an animal having received the bacterial vector component for<br>
assessing the efficiency of colonization of different tissue, and a reporter gene for<br>
assessing induction of transgene activity by subsequent administration of the inductor<br>
saccharide component.<br>
Example 13: Bacterial vector comprising a combination of transgenes, each under the<br>
control of a different saccharide inducible promoter<br>
As an example for multifunctional bacterial vectors for use in the pharmaceutical<br>
combination<br>
42<br><br>
according to the invention, vaccine strain SL7207 was genetically manipulated by Tn7<br>
mediated chromosomal integration of the mini-transposon of a plasmid pHL260b,<br>
modified from pHL260a by replacing the PBAD promoter by the L-rhamnose inducible<br>
promoter (Prha), derived from plasmid pJOE2702 (Stumpp et al., Biospektrum 6, 33-<br>
36(2000)). This strain chromosomally contains at least one copy of gene E of<br>
bacteriophage phiX174 under the control of the rhamnose inducible promoter (Prha). The<br>
resultant strain was then transformed with plasmid pTNFa-lux, containing the<br>
bioluminescence operon of Photorhabdus luminescence under control of the PBAD<br>
promoter in combination with the mouse TNFalpha gene under the control of the<br>
constitutive promoter from beta-lactamase (Pbia). The resultant bacterial vector is<br>
schematically shown in Figure 17.<br>
As described in Example 8, Balb/c mice bearing a CT26 tumor were administered 5 x 106<br>
bacterial vector, suspended in PBS by intravenous administration. 3 days after this<br>
administration, the inductor saccharide, namely 120 mg L-rhamnose, dissolved in PBS,<br>
was administered intraperitoneally. As a result, lysis of bacterial vector and release of<br>
TNFalpha was observed. Upon administration of 120 mg L-arabinose dissolved in PBS<br>
intraperitoneally, to the same mice 1 day later, as well as on consecutive days,<br>
colonization of tumor tissue by bacterial vectors was monitored by spectrometry, more<br>
specifically luminometric analysis of anesthesized mice using a CCD camera.<br>
It could be shown that repeated administration of the inductor saccharides L-rhamnose<br>
and, subsequently, of L-arabinose, results in bacterial lysis and release of TNFalpha in<br>
combination with bioluminescence (RLU). Further, monitoring of tumor location and size<br>
could be demonstrated by luminometric analysis of a monitoring transgene product,<br>
exemplified here by bioluminescence operon of Photorhabdus luminescence, also<br>
allowing observation of the effects of administration of inductor saccharide inducing the<br>
therapeutic transgene, exemplified here by TNFalpha.<br>
This example demonstrates that different transgene activities can be induced<br>
independently and repeatedly at the site of localization of the bacterial vector, exemplified<br>
here by tumor tissue.<br>
