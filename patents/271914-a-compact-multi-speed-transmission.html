CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/949,261 filed on July 12, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having nine or more speeds, four<br>
planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0029] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the nine speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of<br>
a third planetary gear set. A third component or element of the first planetary<br>
gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of a second<br>
planetary gear set. A first component or element of the second planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of the third<br>
planetary gear set. Finally, a third component or element of the third planetary<br>
gear set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of a fourth<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of a nine speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br><br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by E3enford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0031] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0032] The input shaft or member 12 is coupled to the third node 20C<br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The output shaft or member 22 is coupled to<br>
the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node 14A of the<br>
first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 18A of the third planetary<br>
gear set 18. The third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to<br><br>
the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The first node 16A of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the second node 18B of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18. The third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 is<br>
coupled to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0033] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the first node 20A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set<br>
20 and to the input shaft or member 12. A second clutch 28 selectively connects<br>
third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 to the first node 20A of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the second<br>
node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 to the second node 20B of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20 and to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear<br>
set 18. A first brake 32 selectively connects the third node 16C of the second<br>
planetary gear set 16 to a ground or a transmission housing 50. A second brake<br>
34 selectively connects the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 to<br>
a ground or a transmission housing 50. A third brake 36 selectively connects the<br>
first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 to a ground or a transmission<br>
housing 50.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the nine speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br><br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0035] For example, the planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear<br>
member 14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B that supports a set of planet<br>
gears 14D and a ring gear member 14C. The sun gear member 14A is<br>
connected for common rotation with a first shaft or interconnecting member 42<br>
and a second shaft or interconnecting member 44. The ring gear member 14C is<br>
connected for common rotation with a third shaft or interconnecting member 46.<br>
The planet gear carrier member 14B is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48. The planet gears 14D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with both the ring gear member 14C and the sun gear<br>
member 14A.<br>
[0036] The input shaft or member 12 is preferably continuously<br>
connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not<br>
shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected<br>
with the final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0037] The planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16C, a<br>
ring gear member 16A and a planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet gears 16D. The sun gear member 16C is connected for common<br>
rotation with a fifth shaft or interconnecting member 52 and a sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54. The ring gear member 16A is connected for<br>
common rotation with a seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56. The planet<br>
carrier member 16B is connected for common rotation with the third shaft or<br><br>
interconnecting member 46 and a ninth shaft or interconnecting member 59. The<br>
planet gears 16D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member<br>
16C and ring gear member 16A.<br>
[0038] The planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18A, a<br>
ring gear member 18C and a planet carrier member 18B that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet gears 18D. The sun gear member 18A is connected for common<br>
rotation with the first shaft or interconnecting member 42. The ring gear member<br>
18C is connected for common rotation with a tenth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 60. The planet carrier member 18B is connected for common rotation<br>
with the seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56 and with output shaft or<br>
member 22. The planet gears 18D are each configured to intermesh with both<br>
the sun gear member 18A and the ring gear member 18C.<br>
[0039] The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20A, a<br>
planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 20D, and<br>
a ring gear member 20C. The sun gear member 20A is connected for common<br>
rotation with an eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 62. The planet carrier<br>
member 20B is connected for common rotation with the tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 60. The ring gear member 20C is connected for<br>
common rotation with input shaft or member 12. The planet gears 20D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with both the ring gear member 20C and sun gear<br>
member 20A.<br>
[0040] The torque transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, and<br>
brakes 32, 34 and 36 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br><br>
interconnecting members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing<br>
50. For example, the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the<br>
input shaft or member 12 to the eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 62.<br>
The second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 54 to the eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 62.<br>
The third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect the ninth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 59 to the tenth shaft or interconnecting member 60. The<br>
first brake 32 is selectively engageable to connect sun gear member 16C via fifth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 52 to ground, a stationary element, or<br>
transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation of sun gear member 16C relative to<br>
transmission housing 50. The second brake 34 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect planet carrier member 14E3 via fourth shaft or interconnecting member<br>
48 to ground, a stationary element, or transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation<br>
of planet carrier member 14B relative to transmission housing 50. The third<br>
brake 36 is selectively engageable to connect sun gear members 14A, 18A via<br>
first shaft or interconnecting member 42 and second shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 44 to ground, a stationary element, or transmission housing 50 to<br>
restrict rotation of sun gear members 14A, 18A relative to transmission housing<br>
50.<br>
[0041] In the present embodiment, the third clutch 30 and second<br>
brake 34 are larger than clutches 26, 28 and brakes 32, 36. For example, the<br>
third clutch 30 and second brake 34 have increased diameter friction plates or a<br>
greater number of friction plates thus providing additional functional friction<br><br>
surface area than the clutches 26, 28 and brakes 32, 36. The larger clutch 30<br>
and brake 34 allow for increased torque transmitting capacity, shorter<br>
engagement time, and improved wear characteristics. However, the present<br>
invention contemplates that other embodiments have clutches and brakes 26, 28,<br>
30, 32, 34, and 36 of different sizes without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0042] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the nine speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least nine forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio with a<br>
double overdrive. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by<br>
engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first<br>
clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30, first brake 32, second brake 34 and<br>
third brake 36), as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the<br>
various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are activated or<br>
engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the<br>
various gear states are also presented although it should be appreciated that<br>
these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over<br>
significant ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria<br>
of the transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using<br>
the embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course,<br><br>
other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter, gear teeth<br>
count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0043] To establish reverse gear, the first clutch 26, the third clutch 30<br>
and the second brake 34 are engaged or activated. The first clutch 26 connects<br>
the input shaft or member 12 to the eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 62.<br>
The third clutch 30 connects the ninth shaft or interconnecting member 59 to<br>
tenth shaft or interconnecting member 60. The second brake 34 connects planet<br>
carrier member 14B via fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48 to ground, a<br>
stationary element, or transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation of planet carrier<br>
member 14B relative to transmission housing 50. Likewise, the nine forward<br>
ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake<br>
engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0044] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the nine speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or<br>
disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state,<br>
between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or activated in<br>
both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0045] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
