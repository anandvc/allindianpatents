				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a yarn feeder for textile machines.<br>
Yarn feeders are used to feed yarns to yarn using stations, such as<br>
individual knitting stations in loop- forming textile machines. The<br>
yarn feeders are separate devices, which must be secured in great<br>
numbers to the machine. Depending on the use, special demands may<br>
ensue for the yarn feeder that require a certain adaptation. From<br>
the standpoint of the manufacturer of the yarn feeder, it is<br>
therefore expedient if the yarn feeders are easily adaptable to<br>
different situations, which can result from the type of textile<br>
machine used in a given case or from a particular practical use.<br>
Adaptation should be feasible at the least possible expense and with<br>
the simplest possible means.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to create a<br>
versatile yarn feeder.<br>
according to the features of the invention<br>
This object is attained<br>
The yarn feeder of the invention has an adjustable yarn guide<br>
arrangement. The latter includes a yarn guide element, such as a<br>
yarn eyelet, which can be adjusted between two different oblique<br>
draw-off positions relative to the yarn guide drum. Drawing the<br>
yarn off obliquely enables the traveling yarn to keep the yarn guide<br>
drum clean. The adjustment is affected along a specified path.<br>
Thus the yarn guide element can be transferred to at least two<br>
different positions, in which the yarn travels along the lower rim<br>
of the yarn guide drum at different angles. With a comparatively<br>
shallower payout course, that is, in a first position in which the<br>
yarn guide element is relatively high or in other words is only<br>
slightly below the lower rim of the drum but in turn is at a greater<br>
horizontal spacing from it, the yarn being paid out separates<br>
relatively slowly from the windings located on the yarn guide drum<br>
and is then paid out along the lower rim of the drum. This prevents<br>
the situation in which the yarn being paid out could tear the<br>
windings on the yarn guide drum down along with it. In this mode of<br>
operation, the yarn feeder is especially suitable for spun yarns, in<br>
which windings located side by side adhere relatively strongly to<br>
one another because of the filaments protruding from the yarn.<br>
In a second position, the yarn guide element is at a<br>
comparatively great vertical spacing from the lower rim of the yarn<br><br>
guide drum but in turn is set at a lesser horizontal spacing from<br>
the pivot axis. The yarn being paid out is drawn downward<br>
relatively steeply, so that it sweeps firmly over the lower rim of<br>
the yarn guide drum. In this mode of operation, fluff deposits and<br>
rings of fiber, which could form on the lower rim of the yarn guide<br>
drum, are swept off especially well. This operation is especially<br>
suitable for continuous-filament yarns.<br>
The advantage of the adjustable yarn guide element is that the<br>
payout angle of a yarn guided by the yarn guide element is<br>
adjustable. If the yarn is changed, for instance by being cut<br>
upstream of the yarn feeder and with a new yarn being spliced to the<br>
remaining end of the old yarn, then the new yarn travels through the<br>
yarn feeder to the textile machine without having to be threaded in<br>
manually. The yarn guide element can be adapted accordingly in its<br>
position to the filament properties of the yarn.<br>
Another advantage is attained if an existing yarn feeler lever<br>
(shutoff means) is capable of functioning in both adjusting<br>
positions of the yarn guide element without having to be<br>
repositioned. For instance, one yarn feeler lever is disposed such<br>
that it scans the yarn in the vicinity of a fixed yarn eyelet. Any<br>
adjustment of the yarn guide element does not substantially shift<br>
the switching point of the yarn feeler.<br>
The yarn feeder is furthermore preferably modularly designed.<br>
The basic device has a basic carrier, which on one end has a<br>
fastening device that is arranged for connection to the textile<br>
machine, and that at a point spaced apart from this has a rotacably<br>
supported, preferably vertically disposed shaft. The shaft is<br>
arranged on one end for connection to a yarn guide drum and on its<br>
other end is provided with a drive device. This device may be<br>
embodied by a pulley or the like.<br>
A coupling device is provided on the yarn feeder, and<br>
additional modules can be connected to it. Thus the yarn feeder can<br>
be adapted to different kinds of use by means of a plurality of<br>
modules. Beginning with a basic device, a construction kit can thus<br>
be created, with which a number of additional modules can be made.<br>
For the yarn feeder manufacturer, this means that the many types<br>
required can be made using only a few basic elements.<br>
Essentially, the yarn feeder is formed as a basic device by<br>
the parts that are each needed in a large number of applications.<br>
These include the basic carrier, its fastening device for connection<br><br>
to a machine, and a rotatably supported shaft along with a drive<br>
device, and a yarn guide drum that is preferably secured<br>
interchangeably to the shaft. Additional parts are connected to the<br>
basic carrier via one or more coupling devices. The coupling<br>
devices are disposed for instance on both sides of the shaft, which<br>
makes greater freedom of design possible for the mounting of<br>
additional modules.<br>
The coupling device is preferably assigned a retaining device,<br>
with which the counterpart is retained in its desired position. The<br>
retaining device may be a clamping device, detent device, or other<br>
kind of fastening means. The clamping device can for instance be<br>
formed by a chucking device, which deforms the guide device somewhat<br>
and thus brings about clamping by frictional engagement. The result<br>
is secure bearing of the additional module and large-area<br>
transmission of force as well as seating of the additional module<br>
without rattling. The large-area force transmission makes it<br>
possible to embody the coupling device of the same plastic as the<br>
basic carrier, even if the coupling device is required to transmit<br>
some forces.<br>
The additional module can be provided for receiving further<br>
elements, which are preferably retained interchangeably. If the<br>
additional module is a retainer that protrudes freely, for instance,<br>
then different yarn guide elements can be secured to it. Bearings<br>
for further supporting the shaft on the retainer can also be<br>
provided, if necessary.<br>
Another additional module may for instance be a yarn brake.<br>
Depending on the application, various types of brake can be kept on<br>
hand (driven, nondriven, with magnetic clamping of the brake<br>
elements, spring clamping, etc.). A further fixture module may be a<br>
friction module, which in addition to a friction drum that feeds the<br>
yarn by frictional engagement has means for defining the wrap angle<br>
of the yarn around the yarn guide drum. For bearing the yarn guide<br>
means or similar parts that belong to the friction drum, suitable<br>
connection means may also be provided on the underside of the basic<br>
carrier. The basic carrier is preferably formed by a two-shell<br>
housing, which is divided approximately horizontally. The housing<br>
parts are then separably joined to one another, and as a result the<br>
housing interior becomes accessible. Additional devices, such as<br>
electric switches, circuits, bearings for yarn feeler levers and the<br>
like, can be accommodated in the housing interior.<br>
Further details of advantageous embodiments of the invention<br><br>

In Fig. 1, a modular yarn feeder 1 is shown, which is used to<br>
feed a yarn 2 to a textile machine. The yarn feeder has a basic<br>
carrier, embodied as a housing, with a fastening device 4 that<br>
serves to secure the yarn feeder 1 to a suitable retaining device,<br>
such as the retaining ring of a knitting machine.<br>
The housing is constructed of two shells and has an upper<br>
housing part 5 and a lower housing part 6, which abut one another or<br>
fit in one another at a dividing seam 7. As seen from Fig. 2, the<br>
housing serving as a basic carrier 3 has two bearing seats 9, 10 for<br>
ball bearings 11, 12 for rotatably bearing a shaft 14. The shaft is<br>
oriented approximately vertically and has a yarn guide drum 15 on<br>
its lower end. This drum is preferably embodied in one piece as a<br>
deep-drawn sheet-metal part or as a ceramic part. By means of a<br>
retaining screw 17 screwed axially into a bl:_nd bore 16 of the shaft<br><br>
14, the drum is joined to the shaft 14 in a manner fixed against<br>
relative rotation. One or more drive disks 18, 19 are disposed on<br>
the upper end of the shaft 14; via bearing devices, they are<br>
supported rotatably on the shaft 14, and they can be coupled<br>
rotatably to the shaft as needed by means of a coupling disk 21.<br>
The bearing seats 9, 10 are formed by tubular extensions on<br>
the upper and lower housing parts 5, 6. They are aligned with one<br>
another and have a cylindrical chamber, opening toward the outside,<br>
for receiving the respective ball bearing 11, 12. To assure the<br>
alignment of the two bearing seats 9, 10 to one another, a tubular<br>
extension 22 extending through the interior of the housing and<br>
surrounding the shaft 14 is provided on the lower housing part 6; it<br>
engages a corresponding receptacle 23 that :.s formed in the upper<br>
housing part 5. The extension 22 and the receptacle 23 fit without<br>
play in one another.<br>
A plurality of coupling devices 25, 26, 27 for securing<br>
additional modules are provided on the basic carrier 3. The<br>
coupling device 25 is embodied on the basic carrier 3 between the<br>
shaft 14 and the fastening device 4 and is shown separately in Fig.<br>
3. The coupling device 25 includes a guide plate 28, which is<br>
disposed parallel to a housing face 29 and is solidly joined to the<br>
housing part 5 via ribs 31, 32. The guide plate 28, with the guide<br>
face 29 and with its side toward the guide face 29, defines two<br>
guide grooves 33, 34.<br>
A portion 28a of the guide plate 28 protruding freely past the<br>
rib 32 forms a fastening or clamping device for a foot that is meant<br>
to be slipped onto the guide plate 28. A threaded peg 46 is fed<br>
onto the portion 28a and extends, as shown in Fig. 2, into an<br>
opening 37 of the housing part 5. Leading through this opening 37<br>
is a fastening screw 38 whose head is braced on a suitable annular<br>
shoulder 39 formed on the lower housing part 6. If the screw 38 is<br>
tightened, this causes a certain deformation of the guide plate<br>
portion 28a.<br>
In the yarn feeder shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the coupling device<br>
25 includes a blind cap 41, which if needed completely covers the<br>
coupling device 25. The clamshell-like blind cap 41 has an interior<br>
42, in which two opposed clamping cleats 43, 44 extend that between<br>
them define a slit. These cleats are arranged for being thrust into<br>
the guide grooves 33, 34. Once the blind cap 41 has been slipped in<br>
this way onto the coupling device 25, the fastening screw 38 can be<br>
tightened, causing the portion 28a to firmly clamp the blind cap 41<br><br>
with its clamping cleats 43, 44. In the sane way as the blind cap<br>
41, arbitrary other additional modules can be secured to the<br>
coupling device 25 and then each have a foot whose internal shape<br>
conforms to the internal shape of the blind cap 41. One such<br>
additional module can be seen in Fig. 5. A retainer 46 is secured<br>
on the basic carrier 3 and fits over the drive disks 18, 19; on its<br>
free end 47, it has a spring clamp 48 for securing a yarn guide<br>
tubule 49. Still other devices can be secured to the arm 4 6 as<br>
needed.<br>
The coupling device 26 shown in Fig. 2 serves for instance to<br>
secure a brake module 51. The coupling device 2 6 is formed by an<br>
approximately rectangular recess or pocket, into which the brake<br>
module is inserted by a base 52. The base 52 is guided and<br>
positioned by the side faces of the recess formed in the housing<br>
part 5. By means of a clamping screw 53, provided in the immediate<br>
vicinity of the recess, the base 52 is retained in the recess.<br>
The break module 51 is shown separately in Fig. 4. Its base<br>
52 has two parts 56, 57, which are joined via a film hinge 54 and<br>
can be locked to one another. This purpose is served by a detent<br>
cleat 58, formed on the front free face end of the part 56, and a<br>
corresponding detent recess 59 in the other part 57 is associated<br>
with this cleat.<br>
The two parts 56, 57 serve the purpose of axially displaceable<br>
bearing of a brake carrier 61, which is formed by a bent wire<br>
element. This element has two legs 62, 63, parallel to one another,<br>
which are displaceably supported in suitable guides. The leg 62 is<br>
braced on the part 57 via a compression spring 64 and prestresses<br>
the brake carrier 61 in one direction (toward the shaft 14; see Fig.<br>
2). On its free end, the leg 62 has a tappet 66, which cooperates<br>
with a cam provided on the shaft 14.<br>
Outside the base 62, the brake carrier 61 is provided with a<br>
molded yarn guide piece 68, which via a rib 69 carries two brake<br>
disks 71, 72, which are supported freely rotatably on the rib. The<br>
break disks 71, 72 adhere magnetically to one another.<br>
Additional fixtures may be a knot catcher 73 and a yarn inlet<br>
eyelet 74, which are both retained by the fastening screw. As Fig.<br>
1 shows, the yarn inlet eyelet 74 is open, so that the yarn 2 can<br>
simply be placed in it from the side.<br>
The knot catcher 73 is formed for instance by a metal sheet<br><br>
provided with a narrow slit.<br>
The fastening screw 53 can also serve to retain a yarn inlet<br>
eyelet 75, which is disposed on an arm 7 6 above the drive disk 18.<br>
The coupling device 27 is formed by the outer conical or<br>
cylindrical face of the tubular extension 10, which extends into the<br>
interior of the yarn guide drum 15. As Fig. 6 or Fig. 2 also shows,<br>
the yarn guide drum 15 is therefore placed with its upper rim<br>
relatively far away from the underside of the housing part 6,<br>
approximately at the same level as a yarn guide eyelet 78, which is<br>
molded as a fixed yarn guide eyelet on the lower housing part 6.<br>
The interstice can be closed by a cover hood 79, which is slipped<br>
for instance onto the extension 10. As Fig. 7 shows, the yarn guide<br>
drum 15 can be supplemented with or replaced by a friction module<br>
80. The friction module 80 includes the yarn guide drum 15 and a<br>
friction disk 81 joined to the drum in a manner fixed against<br>
relative rotation. The friction unit 80 also includes a setting<br>
lever 82, which has a yarn guide eyelet 83 at approximately the<br>
level of the transition between the friction disk 81 and the yarn<br>
guide drum 15 and otherwise extends radially to the pivot axis of<br>
the shaft 14. For pivotable bearing of the lever 82, clamping rings<br>
84, 85 are slipped onto the coupling device 27 and seated on it;<br>
between them, they clamp an annular bearing region of the lever 82.<br>
The annular bearing region may be provided with one or more<br>
protrusions that engage corresponding recesses in the clamping rings<br>
84, 85, in order to fix the lever 82 in various detent positions.<br>
In order to set the yarn feeder 1 for friction operation, in<br>
many cases an outlet brake 91 is expedient or required. This brake<br>
is preferably disposed between two yarn guide eyelets 93, 94 on the<br>
outlet side. For fastening the outlet brake 91 detachably to the<br>
yarn feeder, a base 95 is used, which is provided with a threaded<br>
opening and is located below the fastening device 4. This allows<br>
the outlet brake to be screwed on. It has a lower, approximately<br>
horizontally disposed brake disk, which is carried by a pin 97<br>
provided with an opening. An upper brake plate is supported<br>
displaceably in the direction of the arrow on this pin and can be<br>
locked in its upper position. This disk, by its own weight, presses<br>
the yarn 2 against the brake disk 96.<br>
The yarn feeder 1 has an adjustable yarn guide arrangement, to<br>
which the yarn guide eyelet 93 belongs. To explain the structure<br>
and function, reference will be made below to Figs. 8 through 11.<br>
As seen from Figs. 8 and 9, the yarn guide eyelet 93 can be<br>
transferred to at least two different positions and locked in those<br><br>
positions. In the first position, shown in Fig. 8, the yarn guide<br>
eyelet 93 is located a short distance below a plane E, defined by<br>
the lower rim of the yarn guide drum 15, and is retained at a<br>
relatively great spacing from the pivot axis D of the drum. The<br>
preferably rectilinear path W along which the yarn guide eyelet 93<br>
is adjustable or displaceable forms an acute angle with the pivot<br>
axis D, as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
The yarn guide eyelet 93 is carried by two substantially<br>
parallel wire legs 105 extending away from it, which are guided in a<br>
slot 106 formed in the housing. The slot 106, as shown in Figs. 10<br>
and 11, is formed between the upper housing part 5 and the lower<br>
housing part 6. For each leg 105, there is one slot 106 on each<br>
side of the housing. In Figs. 10 and 11, the same reference<br>
numerals are therefore used for the slots 106 and their details, and<br>
the description applies equally to both slots 106.<br>
The slot 106 includes a pocket, which is formed between the<br>
upper housing part 5 and the lower housing part 6 and is open toward<br>
the bottom. The pocket is formed on the part of the housing part 5<br>
by two groove-like or channel-like indentations 107, 108, between<br>
which a protrusion 109 is formed that is aimed at a corresponding<br>
cheek 111 of the lower housing part 6. Between the cheek 111 and<br>
the protrusion 109, however, a gap remains, through which the<br>
applicable wire leg 105 can be thrust. The wire legs 105 yield<br>
outward, however, so that on both ends of their path, which are<br>
formed by the indentations 107, 108, they snap into place. The<br>
channel-like indentations 107, 108 are thus both detent and guide<br>
means at the same time, because they support the wire legs 105<br>
nonpivotably. The wire legs 105 are also seated axially<br>
nondisplaceably in the slot 106. To that end, ends bent inward or<br>
angled in some other way are formed on the wire legs 105 and engage<br>
the cheek 111, for instance, from behind, the cheek being embodied<br>
as flat itself and extending between to outward-protruding ribs 114,<br>
115. As needed, the ribs 114, 115 can either engage the<br>
indentations 107, 108 or adjoin them. The narrow ribs 114 can for<br>
instance engage the recess 108 and thus with their inner flank can<br>
determine the alignment of the wire leg 105. The vertical<br>
orientation of the yarn guide eyelet 93 is thus associated with the<br>
lower housing part 6. The yarn guide eyelet 93 preferably allows a<br>
certain lateral play for the yarn but is disposed centrally on the<br>
housing. The yarn 2 travelling away from the yarn guide eyelet 93<br>
and the pivot axis of the yarn guide drum 19 are thus preferably<br>
both located in the same plane. The yarn feeder of Fig. 1 described<br>
thus far functions as follows:<br><br>
In operation, the yarn 2 is put in place and threaded in, as<br>
shown. it extends through the inlet eyelet 74, through the space<br>
between the brake plates 71, 72, to the yarn eyelet 78, and the yarn<br>
2 in the interstice holds a yarn feeler lever 100, here supported<br>
pivotably, in a raised position. Beginning at the yarn eyelet 78,<br>
the yarn 2 passes in multiple windings around the yarn guide drum 15<br>
and then travels, obliquely sweeping the lower rim of the drum to<br>
the textile machine via the yarn guide eyeless 93, 94. Between the<br>
yarn guide eyelets 93, 94, a further yarn feeler lever 101 rests on<br>
the yarn, in order to monitor its tension. The yarn feeler lever<br>
101 is connected to a switch, which furnishes a switching signal<br>
whenever the yarn feeler lever 101 drops below a minimum height.<br>
The yarn feeler lever 101 is disposed such that when the yarn<br>
is held taught, in each setting position of the yarn guide element<br>
93, it is held in the same or at least nearly the same position.<br>
The rated position of the feeler lever 101 is as a result<br>
independent of the setting of the yarn guide element 93. This is<br>
attained by means of a pivotable bearing of the yarn feeler lever<br>
101 in the vicinity of the pivot axis D and by a relatively long<br>
lever length; the yarn 2 is scanned in the vicinity of the fixed<br>
yarn guide eyelet 94.<br>
If needed, further yarn feeler elements may be provided, whose<br>
rated and switching positions are equally unaffected by the<br>
adjustment of the adjustable yarn guide arrangement.<br>
In operation, the yarn guide drum 15 is driven to rotate and<br>
thus feeds specified quantities of yarn.<br>
For instance, if a spun yarn, which has relatively many<br>
filaments protruding from the yarn, is to be processed, then the<br>
setting of the yarn feeder 1 as shown in Fig. 8 is preferred. The<br>
yarn guide eyelet 93 here is in an upper position at a relatively<br>
slight spacing below the plane E, but at a greater spacing from the<br>
pivot axis D. The yarn 2 is drawn off relatively shallowly and thus<br>
deviates rather slowly from the package located on the yarn guide<br>
drum 15. This prevents the yarn 2 being paid out from tearing<br>
windings of the package downward.<br>
If a comparatively smooth continuous-filament yarn is to be<br>
processed, then the yarn 2 is torn off upstream of the yarn feeder<br>
1, and the new yarn is knotted to the end of the old yarn.<br>
Furthermore, for setting to the smoother continuous-filament yarn,<br>
the yarn guide eyelet 93 is transferred downward to the position<br><br>
shown in Fig. 9, in which it is farther away from the plane E but in<br>
turn closer to the pivot axis D. This spacing, however, is still<br>
greater than the diameter of the lower rim of the yarn guide drum<br>
15. The yarn is now drawn off relatively steeply, so that it<br>
reliably sweeps over the rim of the yarn guide drum 15 and strips<br>
off any fluff or the like present there.<br>
For adjusting the yarn guard eyelet, the wire legs 105<br>
are pressed together, counter to their own spring force, so that<br>
they emerge from the respective indentations 107 and 108 (see Fig.<br>
10). The element formed by the yarn guide eyelet 93 and the wire<br>
legs 105 can be displaced in this condition along the path W. Once<br>
it is released at the end of the path, the wire legs 105 snap back<br>
into the respective indentations 107 or 108, and the yarn guide<br>
eyelet 93 is locked in its new position. The path W can be linear,<br>
or in other words a straight line. If needed, it can also be<br>
curved, for instance by disposing the yarn guide eyelet 93 on the<br>
end of a pivotably supported arm.<br>
If needed, intermediate positions can be provided, by forming<br>
suitable grooves in the protrusions 109. If the yarn guide drum 15<br>
is replaced with the friction unit 80 of Fig. 7, then the yarn 2<br>
wrapping around the friction disk 81 is correspondingly carried<br>
along and advanced. Replacing the yarn guide drum 15 with the<br>
friction unit 80 thus makes it possible to vary the functional<br>
principle.<br>
The brake module 51 can also be replaced by a non- driven yarn<br>
brake module. The yarn feeder 1 can also be refitted by removing<br>
the blind cap 41 and replacing it with the arm 46 (Fig. 5).<br>
For a modular yarn feeder 1, a basic carrier 3 is a basic<br>
component on which additional modules can be secured as needed by<br>
suitable coupling devices. This makes the yarn feeder more<br>
adaptable to different kinds of use and situations.<br><br>
