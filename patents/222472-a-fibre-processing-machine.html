The present invention relates to a fibre processing machine, in particular a spinning preparation device with an elevator lattice cloth and a movable return means, for example a rotatable back stripping roller.<br>
Spinning preparation devices are mainly applied in blow room lines for the preparation of cotton, in order to prepare it for spinning. Blow room lines mainly consist of a bale opener, which opens the supplied raw cotton, which is then forwarded in the form of flocks. Thereby coarse contaminations are also extracted from the cotton. Normally the fibre flocks then enter a mixer, which for instance by way of various chutes, provides mixing of the fibre flocks. Thereafter the fibres are taken out from the mixer by means of an elevator lattice cloth and are being moved further. Such a type of cloth conveys the fibre material upwards from a feed box, mostly in an inclined direction.<br>
From DE-A-546 201 it is known to add a doffer to such a cloth of a fibre take-off device, which again combs off extensive accumulations of fibre material from the needle cloth. DE 41 30 822 shows a roller (16), which apparently is supposed to fulfil a corresponding function. EP 392 869 in turn shows a further alternative in the form of a second lattice cloths (S), which cooperates with the elevator lattice cloth. Finally the mixing machine UNImix B 7/3, offered by the applicant company, is also provided with a so called back stripping roller. The latter machine is the closest form of the known state of art as is being further explained in the following according to the figures.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to improve the effectiveness of such arrangements. In particular the conveying output of the described fibre take-off device as well as the fibre material mixing within the storage and the separation of fibre lumps are to be improved.<br>
Said task is being solved by a fibre processing machine or a processing method in such a way, in that to an elevator lattice cloth a movable return means is being<br><br>
arranged, which is to cooperate with the cloth within a given area (operating area), whereat within the operating area the directions of movement of the cloth and of the return means are the same (in synchronism). A further important feature of the device or method respectively, according to the invention is the application of a diverting plate above the return means. Said diverting plate is positioned at a suitable distance opposite the outer surface of the return means. With this arrangement the surplus fibre material is returned back to the storage area, over a path above the return means, that is between the return means and the diverting plate.<br>
Tests surprisingly and unexpectedly showed that the operation of a back stripping means, in particular of a back stripping roller, in synchronism with the moving direction of the cloth (elevator lattice cloth) within the operating area leads to an increased conveying effect and to an improved separation of the fibre lumps, while maintaining or even improving the mixing within the storage. A further unexpected characteristic of the arrangement according to the invention is the fact that in spite of the increased conveying volume no congestion problems are caused since the succeeding take-off roller can forward the increased amount of fibre material being processed without any problems. For this, however, the take-off roller requires an increased circumferential speed in relation to the speed of the cloth surface. Further advantageous effects of the functions and arrangements according to the invention are being described further below.<br>
The fibre processing machine can in particular consist of a mixer, in particular a chute type mixer. By applying a chute mixer a good mixing effect of the fibres is achieved, while a simple take-off of the mixed fibres by means of the elevator lattice cloth is achieved.<br>
After the elevator lattice cloth a pneumatic fibre or flock conveying means respectively can be provided. For this a duct with an air flow has proved to be successful, since by said means the fibre flocks are moved onward in a simple and reliable manner. It is however, also known (for instance from EP-A-874 070) to provide an extraction device in succession of the elevator lattice cloth, in particular for the extraction of foreign<br><br>
material in the sense of foreign fibres. The pneumatic conveying means is then being located after the extracting device. It is further known to provide a cleaning point between the lattice cloth and the conveying means - for this see for instance EP-A-810 309 (machine 90).<br>
In the following the invention is being described by way of the drawing, wherein show:<br>

Figure 8 a possible configuration of a feature of the invention,<br>
Figure 9 a possible return means with differing clothings (sheet metal clothing).<br>
The spinning preparation equipment of figure 1 shows a complete blow room line. Said line consists of a bale opener 1, to which a coarse cleaning means 2 (for instance according to EP-B-381860) is being arranged in down stream direction. Both are interconnected via a pneumatic duct 11 which conveys the fibre flocks in an air stream from the bale opener 1 to the coarse cleaning means 2. Also via a pneumatic duct 11, the fibre flocks are thereafter being conveyed from the coarse cleaning means 2 to a<br><br>
mixer 3, whereat the fibres are being mixed before its further processing. The fibre flocks are transported cloud-like within the pneumatic ducts. Partly they are intermingled in thick balls or fibre lumps and before cleaning they contain various foreign matter.<br>
For the mixing of the fibres there are several types of mixers available. In the present case a chute type mixer 3 is being applied, see figure 2, wherein the fibres at first are being deposited in chutes of different lengths, from which they are being taken out again and whereby they are mixed thoroughly . During deposition of the flocks in the chutes the conveying air has to be separated. The fibres are taken off by means of a elevator lattice cloth 10, which moves alongside the chutes, that is past the fibres contained in them. In the example shown in figure 2 the elevator lattice cloth 10 conveys the fibres to the separating device 4. This represents the operating principle of the invention according to EP-A-874070, whereby said principle is of no importance for the present invention. An alternative principle will be described later on in connection with the figures 5 and 6. Within the separating device 4 the good fibres are being separated from foreign fibres. In order to give a complete picture, the separating device 4 is also being described in the following.<br>
After the separation of the foreign fibres the conveyed fibres are forwarded by way of a further pneumatic duct 11, that is from the separating device 4 to the conveying device 6 and then further to a device 5 for fine cleaning (for instance according to US-B-5,123,145) which is succeeded by a device for intensive cleaning 5a. After leaving the intensive cleaning means 5a the fibres reach a card feeder 60 which supplies several cards 7 with fibres or fibre flocks respectively (for instance according to EP-B-303 023). Figure 1 shows the major blow room machines in a blow room line, whereat in some applications one or the other machine, for instance the intensive cleaning device, is not necessarily required or in other applications some of the machines that were described can be applied more than only once. In modern blow room lines for instance the fine cleaner 5 and 5a as well as the card feeder 60 may be combined into one single machine and fine cleaning stage. For instance the fine cleaner device type B60 of the applicant, corresponds with such a fibre processing machine.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the chute type mixer 3 of figure 1 in a cross sectional view. The chute type mixer 3 is sub-divided into several chutes 29 which are open on their upper side and onto which the pneumatic duct 11 is connected. By way of a distributor box the arriving fibre flocks are evenly distributed into the various chutes 29. Downstream of the distributor box the chutes at first extend in vertical direction, that is before they make a 90°-turn so that the chutes and their fibre content extend now in horizontal direction. Their horizontal extension ends right in front of an elevator lattice cloth 10, which moves slantedly (basically in vertical direction) from the lower section in upward direction, thereby taking-off the fibres. With this configuration of the mixer as a chute type mixer 3, it is made possible that, because of the different lengths of the chutes, that means the different path lengths, through which the fibres have to travel, the fibres shown in the left chute are taken off later than in the fibres shown in the right chute. This can be seen from the differently shaded areas. This way the fibres or fibre flocks respectively are thoroughly mixed with other fibres or fibre flocks respectively, being supplied to the mixer at different times.<br>
After the fibres have been taken off the chutes by means of the elevator lattice cloth 10 the fibres are conveyed upward vertically and conveyed from the elevator lattice cloth 10 which cooperates with a back stripping roller 17, to the separating device. After passing the separating device 4 the fibres are being taken over by the conveying means 6 and for instance transferred to the fine cleaner 5 (see figure 1) or to any other blow room machine.<br>
The device 4 is designed in such a way that the fibre fleece taken over by the elevator lattice cloth 10 moves in vertical direction, thereby passing in front of the sensors 41 as well as in front of the blowing nozzles 44. For this the fibre fleece is being diverted by approximately 90° over the conveying roller 210. The separating device 4 also comprises a computer 43 which is connected with the optical sensors 41 via a data transmitting line 42. Furthermore a control line connects the blowing nozzles 44 with said computer. The sensors 41 are arranged in a horizontal line on the side of the fibre fleece 22 which lays opposite of the mixer 3. Foreign fibres being detected by the sensors are removed from the flock stream by actuating the blowing nozzles 44.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows an elevator lattice cloth 10 according to the known state of art as it is being applied in the device according figure 2 for taking-off the fibres from the chute type mixer. The elevator lattice cloth 10 is made in the form of a needle lattice cloth which is being applied in known fashion in spinning preparation machines as a conveyor and opening means. It basically consists of an endless cloth with belts and cross bars 100 arranged on it in small spaces, in which slanted steel pins 101 are being mounted, which accomplish the flock conveyance. The cloth is mounted on a support (not shown) in order to form a longish endless path with upper and lower reversing area. The takeoff device whereof the cloth is one part also comprises a drive (also not shown) so that the cross bars 100 are moved in clockwise direction according to figures 2 and 3. If in the present disclosure the expression „cloth" is mentioned, then in general this can mean any suitable conveying tape for the conveyance of fibre material, thus also elevator lattice cloths or needle lattice cloths respectively.<br>
The back stripping rollers 17 known from the present state of known art (also called mixing rollers) or the return means in general, are located near the upper reversing area of the cloth, that is where (as far as applied) the cross bars of the cloth and the outer cloth surface leave the (almost) vertical section of the endless path and move into the reverse area (see figure 2). Surplus material is thus tossed back into the storage means 12. Only such fibre material within the operating area is further conveyed which fits between the back stripping roller and the cloth.<br>
The function of a mixer of the known state of art is to be explained on the base of the schematic illustration of figure 4 together with the pertaining fibre take-off device. The mixers thoroughly mixes (blends) the fibre material by way of deviating the chutes 29 from the vertical into horizontal direction and due to the different paths lengths the fibres have to travel (see explanation for figure 2). In the drawing this is labelled as "1. Durchmischung" ("1. thorough mixing"). The fibre material or the horizontal layers respectively, are moved to the cloth 100 by means of the conveying belt 30. The cloth 100, for instance a needle lattice cloth, with its needles takes-off the horizontal and relatively thick layers and thus conveys the taken-off material on a nearly vertical path upwards. The fibre material that has been taken off by means of the needles and<br><br>
conveyed by the cloth, at first is moved through a narrow passage 31 until it reaches the enlarged section of the storage area 32 (also called mixing chamber). Thereby the, up to this stage, relatively dense and compacted fibre material or cotton wool respectively, can expand. The fibre material originating from the horizontal layers however, is not homogeneous, but varies in its densities. The expansion of the fibre material and the variation in density has the effect that Jumps" are being dissolved after passing the narrow section 31 and that the lumps fall from the cloth into the storage or mixing chamber 32 respectively. Anyhow, on its way up along the nearly vertical conveying path of the cloth 100 again and again fibre material is separated from the cloth and falls into the storage chamber. Within the upper reversing area of the cloth 100 there is a back stripping roller 17, which turns clockwise. In the operating area AB between the back stripping roller and the cloth 100, fibre material which cannot keep itself on the cloth and its needles is stripped or thrown back into the storage means or the mixing chamber 32 respectively. Within the storage means 32 the containing fibre material develops a rotating movement. Said movement- indicated as "2. Durchmischung" ("2. thorough mixing") in figure 2 - causes on one hand a further thorough mixing of the fibres. On the other hand the previously mentioned Jumps" consisting of fibres are being dissolved into smaller fibre flocks. This further thorough mixing can considerably improve the „1. thorough mixing" and can increase the efficiency of the device. The fibre material clinging to the cloth, and which could not be stripped off by the back stripping roller is being transported over the upper reversing area and is then completely removed by a take-off or stripping roller 76 respectively. The upper and lateral cover 33 thereby has only to functions, that is to provide a suitable storage means 32 for the fibre take-off device and to separate the device from other parts of the mixer in order to prevent that fibres can escape. The covers according to the state of the known art do not have a „deviation" or „guiding function" as is being the case in connection of the device according to the invention which is being described in the following.<br>
In order to control the conveying quantity the mixing and fibre take-off device in figure 4 is provided with two possible procedures: First, to stop the conveying belt 30 as well as the cloth 100, for instance for reasons of the succeeding machine. Secondly, to control the conveying quantity by the level regulation of the fibre take-off machine. For this,<br><br>
within the storage chamber the sensors 34 are being provided from a certain height on. If the more or less rotating fibre mass within the storage chamber 32 reaches the level of the highest positioned sensor (for instance a light barrier) then this is an indication that the storage chamber 32 is full: The conveying belt 30 stops the supply, while the cloth 100 continues to convey. The cloth 100 can thus not take any more fibre material from the horizontal layers and therefore conveys merely fibre flocks from the storage 32. Thus the quantity of fibres in the storage chamber 32 declines. If the stored fibre quantity drops below the level of the lowest sensor, the conveying belt 30 is started again. Besides these two possible procedures (a quasi „stop and go" of the endless belts) to control the conveying quantity, these traditional installations are furnished with further setting possibilities to gauge the conveying quantity. One such possibility is to vary the space between the back stripping roller 17 and the cloth 100 or the space between the stripping roller 76 and the cloth 100 respectively, and to change the relative speed difference between the outer surface or the teeth respectively of the back stripping roller and the outer cloth surface. In traditional installations these adjustments are actually only set once and are not changed anymore during the operation of the installation. One disadvantage of the traditional installation is, that with an adaptation of these adjustment possibilities the conveying quantity can only be increased to a limited degree. The mentioned adjustment possibilities do also exist in the device according to the invention, but with the difference that in this case the conveying quantity can be influenced to a considerably greater extent, i.e. it can be increased. For the object of the present application in addition, provision is made to also change the mentioned adjustment possibilities during operation of the installation.<br>
The combination of the mixer with the separating device represents a specific application, which however is not important for the present invention. The figures 5 and 6 each show an embodiment without such a separating device, for instance a mixing machine for the application in a blow room according to EP-A-810309 (see figure 4 and 5 of the mentioned disclosure ). Figure 5, alike to figure 4 of the present application are for the explanation of the state of the known art, while the figure 6 serves for the more detailed explanation of an arrangement according to the invention. The same numerals are used in figures 4, 5 and 6 in order to refer to the components which were already<br><br>
described in connection with figures 1 to 3. Accordingly in figure 3 or 5 the back stripping roller 17 and the part of the cloth 100 are shown, which together with the roller 17 form the respective reversing area. The numeral 70 in each of these figures refers to parts of the machine frame, which in both cases supports a drive 72 for the roller 17. In figure 5 the machine frame 70 comprises the cover 33 (according to figure 4) which, however, is not shown precisely. The motor 72 is connected with the roller 17 by a belt 74.<br>
In each of these arrangements a so called take-off or stripping roller 76 and a respective drive motor 78 are also mounted on the machine frame. To the specialist said type of roller is well known from the present state of the known art and in both illustrated embodiments it performs its general function and is therefore not further described. A not shown drive moves the elevator lattice cloth on an endless path in the direction of arrow A (again in clockwise direction). On the elevator lattice cloth cross bars with steel pins 101 are being fastened.<br>
In the traditional arrangement according to figure 5 the motor 72 - as already described in figure 4 - drives the roller 17 in rotary direction indicated with arrow B, i.e. also in clockwise direction. The roller 17 accordingly turns contrary to the cloth within the operating area AB and immediately throws surplus fibre material back into the storage chamber (not shown in figures 5 and 6). This improves the thorough mixing, however it can also lead to a more extensive treatment of the fibres and possibly to nep formation. The layout of the roller 17 (in particular its clothing) and the suitable number of revolution of the roller 17 are also known to the specialist; for this see description to figure 9.<br>
In the new arrangement according to the invention, shown in figure 6, the motor 72 drives the roller 17 of the same construction in turning direction as is indicated by arrow C, i.e. in counter clockwise direction. Therefore within the operating area AB the roller 17 runs in the same direction as the cloth and accordingly helps to convey the fibre material carried from the cloth. With a suitable selection of the speed of the roller in relation to the speed of the cloth cross bars, it is now possible to effect an additional<br><br>
opening of the conveyed material. The roller 17 still throws surplus fibre material back into the storage chamber, however, not anymore immediately but by the conveyance over that part of the roller circumference, which is at distance from the cloth. The layout of the roller 17 and the turning speed of the roller can be optimised by way of tests in order to optimise the mentioned effects.<br>
The function of the invention is now being disclosed more precisely according to figure 7. The schematic illustration of the device according to the invention is similar to the mixer with the pertaining fibre take-off device known from the one in figure 4. Actually the few constructive changes according to the invention effect a considerable improvement of the operating process and conveying capacity of the installation. The same components therefore have the same numerals as in figure 4.<br>
Here as well, the function of the cloth 100 and of the storage chamber 32 is the same. Contrary to the present state of the known art the back stripping roller however turns in opposite direction, i.e. in counter clockwise direction. Thus the back stripping roller 17 loses its initial function of „back stripping" or ..throwing back" and gains instead an actually new function: It assists the cloth 100 to „convey" fibre material: Within the operating area AB the fibre material being conveyed by the cloth 100 either remains on the cloth and is being transported over the upper reverse area, or however, it is caught by the back stripping roller 17 which rotates in counter clockwise direction. Contrary to traditional installations the material being caught by the back stripping roller 17 is not thrown back, but instead it is conveyed or hurled into the conveying direction of the cloth. Thereafter the return means conveys the material caught within the operation zone AB, into two directions (in the figure shown by two connected arrows). The fibres are either conveyed in conveying direction of the cloth into the upper reversing area or they follow the outer surface of the rotary return means and are conveyed back over the return means into the storage or mixing chamber 32 respectively. During this movement within the second path of conveyance the fibre flocks being caught by the return means are at first thrown against the cover 35 or 36 by the centrifugal force. The air stream being generated by the rotating return means then draws the fibre flocks in rotating direction of the return means. Until the fibre flocks being conveyed by the air stream<br><br>
reach the storage chamber 32, they may be hurled back and forth for several times between the cover and the outer surface of the return means. This effect according to the invention is enhanced in that above the back stripping means a suitable deviation means is being provided (for instance a diverting cover 35 as shown in figure 7). In order to generate the mentioned air stream, the presence of a cover or a cover plate respectively can be particularly important. The diverting plate or the adapted cover has to be positioned at a suitable space in relation to the outer surface of the return means, so that a suitable air stream can develop. The most suitable distance is best determined through tests. The diverting plate 35 does also effect that the fibre material to be conveyed back between the outer surface of the return means and the diverting plate, is conveyed into the direction of storage and does not reach the reversing area of the cloth. The diverting plate 35 in figure 7 is especially suitably shaped because it practically follows the outer surface return means at a suitable distance. This effects an optimal air stream as well as an ideal guidance for the fibre flocks back into the storage or mixing chamber 32. The shape of the diverting plate, however, can also be simpler and can eventually have any type of shape. It is also possible that on existing installations only smaller or no modifications at all are required on the covers or machine frames (see figure 5, component 70), in order to obtain a diverting cover according to the invention. The diverting plate claimed in the claims therefore does not need to have a particular shape, but has only to fulfil the function to convey part of the fibre material caught by the return means back into the storage chamber. In order to improve the separation of the transported fibre quantity into two mass streams the machine according to the invention is preferably being provided with a „nose" 36. Said nose improves and also supports the effect of the diverting plate 35 (diversion of the flocks into the desired direction and generation of an air stream).<br>
A further advantage of the invention is being obtained in that the fibre material being conveyed or hurled respectively past the area above the return means, practically experiences a further treatment. Due to the fact that the material moves back and forth several times between the clothing of the return means and the cover, the material is better dissolved. Especially the lumps mentioned before are thus eliminated. Thus smaller flocks are led back into the storage or mixing chamber 32 respectively. With the<br><br>
installation according to the invention one thus obtains better dissolving of the flocks and better thorough mixing.<br>
Besides the improved performance of the mixer with regard to the thorough mixing, dissolving and flock size, with the installation according to the invention also considerably larger conveying or processing quantities respectively of fibre materials are possible. The capability for adjustments such as distance return means - cloth, distance cloth - take-off roller, furthermore absolute as well as relative speeds of the mentioned components, have a high influence on the effective production for the installation according to the invention. For the object of the invention preferably the back stripping roller (with a diameter of 250 mm) turns at a speed of 560 rpm, the lattice cloth comprises an effective diameter of 160 mm and turns within a range of 21.6 to 216 rpm, while the take-off roller with a diameter of 250 mm has a speed of 660 rpm.<br>
The risk of congestion within the upper reversing area at increased conveying and processing quantity does not exist for the mentioned speeds of take-off device. By occurrence of such a case the speed would have to be increased.<br>
Figure 8 shows the invention with a different layout of the diverting plate. Herby no specifically formed diverting plate and no actual nose is being applied. The cover 33 known from figure 4 has merely been supplemented with a guiding plate 35. In an arrangement according to figure 8 said guiding plate 35 takes over the function of the diverting plate and of the nose according figure 7. The effectiveness of the guiding plate 35 is not as favourable as the diverting plate with the pertaining nose, however, it can also actuate a suitable diversion of the flocks into the desired direction above the return means. If the arrangement (distance) of the cover or the machine frame respectively toward the return means allows for an arrangement as is shown in figure 8 with a cover 33, then also this way a sufficient air stream can be produced. The invention therefore also claims said simplified and equivalent form of a diverting plate.<br>
Figure 9 shows two possible types of clothings (sheet metal clothings) on the back stripping roller 17. Naturally further types of clothings are possible and can be applied,<br><br>
for instance a tooth or a needle clothing. The dimensions and the density of the clothing (for instance the spacing between the plates and their height) are to be adapted according to the requirements.<br>
It should be noted that this application is not restricted to return means in the form of back stripping rollers according to the numeral 17. The invention can also be applied on further return means, for instance on return means according to EP 392 869.<br>
Accordingly the invention makes provision for a fibre processing machine with a elevator lattice cloth, a movable return means which cooperates with the cloth in a predetermined range (operating area) and a drive for the return means, whereat the drive can be actuated in such a way that within the operating area the conveying direction of the cloth and of the return means is the same (in synchronism). Naturally there are also embodiments possible where several elevator lattice cloths and return means are being applied. The object of the invention also refers to these devices.<br>
Above the return means the fibre processing machine is provided with a diverting plate, which is located at a suitable distance opposite the outer surface of return means in such a way, that by the movement of the return means an air stream develops, which, together with the movement of said outer surface of return means enables that the surplus fibre material is being returned above the return means back into the storage chamber.<br>
Above the operating area the fibre processing machine can be furnished with a nose shaped contour. In the preferred embodiment the nose and the diverting plate are merged.<br>
The mentioned fibre processing machine can be provided with a rotatable return roller (17) as a return means. The return roller (17) can be furnished with a clothing, preferably a sheet metal type clothing. It is also feasible to provide arrangements where the return means consists of several return rollers. The fibre processing machine according to the invention is set in such a way, that the speed of the return means on its<br><br>
outer surface is higher than the speed at the outer surface of the cloth, preferably the two means move according to at least one of the following speed parameters: The circumferential speed of the return means is between 4 to 8 m/s higher than the circumferential speed of the cloth; the circumferential speed of the cloth is between 0.1 and 3 m/s; the circumferential speed of the return means is between 5 to 10 m/s, preferably 7.33 m/s.<br>
Preferably the circumferential speed of the take-off roller is higher than the speed of the cloth. Preferably the circumferential speed of the take-off roller is 7 to 10 m/s, in particular preferable is a speed of 8.63 m/s. For the subsequent transport of the fibres in the described fibre processing machine a duct (11) with an air stream as transporting means (6) can be provided.<br>
The mentioned fibre processing machine according to the exemplified embodiments can - but does not necessarily need to - be a mixer (3) in particular a chute type mixer, a mixing bale opener or a mixing opener.<br>
In the fibre processing machine according to the invention at least one or two of the following positions can be varied: the position and the distance from the return means to the cloth; the distance and the position of the take-off roller to the cloth, whereat preferably these positions can be set during operation of the fibre processing machine.<br>
In the described fibre processing machines the operating area can be located within the reversing area of the elevator lattice cloth.<br>
The invention obviously also comprises a method for the fibre processing machine, which at least comprises an elevator lattice cloths and at least one movable return means, whereat the (one or more) return means cooperate with the elevator lattice cloth in a predetermined area (operating area) and whereat a drive is being provided for the (one or more) return means, whereat the drive for the (one or more) return means is being actuated in such a way, that within the operating area the moving directions of the cloth and of the (one or more) return means are the same (in synchronism).<br><br>
The invention is not limited to these described examples. As already mentioned, there are other return means known from the state of the known art, as was for instance explained by way of the patent literature mentioned in the introduction. There are also arrangements possible, whereby the return means consists of several return rollers. Arrangements with several return rollers are for instance known in connection with the mixing bale opener B3/4 or the mixing opener B3/3 of the applicant. Known return means can be modified according to the present invention. The invention is not limited to the application in a mixer. Also, instead of a cloth other suitable conveying means, in particular other conveying tapes, can be applied. Combinations of the individual embodiments are possible as well as other forms and layouts of the device according to the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
