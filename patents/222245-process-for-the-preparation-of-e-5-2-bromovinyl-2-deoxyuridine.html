				<td>The present invention discloses a process for the preparation of (E)-5- (2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (Brivudine) wherein halogen-free solvents are used in the whole process and in particular in the first step of bromination of 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine diacylate.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
(E)-5- (2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (Brivudine) of formula I is a compound endowed with strong antiviral activity, particularly useful for the treatment of Herpes Zoster infections.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
A first method of synthesis is described in DE 2 915 254 and comprises the alkylation of (E)-5- (2-bromovinyl) uracile with l-chloro-2-deoxy-3, 5-di-O- p-tolyl-a-D-erithro-pentafuranose and subsequent deacylation to give the compound of formula I.<br>
A drawback of this method is that the synthesis of (E)-5- (2- bromovinyl) uracile is troublesome and gives poor yields. Moreover, the compound of formula I obtained thereby is not pure, but is a mixture of alpha and beta isomers. Only the latter has a practical value and needs to be isolated by chromatographic separation.<br>
An alternative method is described in GB 2 125 399 (corresponding DE<br><br>

Said compound III is then dehydrobrominated in a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, in the presence of a tertiary base, to give the nucleoside of formula IV (wherein R has the same meanings indicated for the compounds of formula II),<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with a yield of 62-69%: after removal of the protective groups, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine of formula I is obtained with a yield of about<br>
93%.<br>
Over the last years bromochloromethane has become in the industrial practice the solvent of choice in radical reactions promoted by thermal initiators, due to its relatively high boiling point (68 Â°C) and to its lower toxicity - compared with other halogenated solvents such as, for example, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane. Nevertheless, the use of this solvent has been recently forbidden because of the risks connected to the reduction of the ozone layer (see CEE regulation N.2037/2000 of the European Parliament).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that Brivudine can be advantageously obtained by reaction of the compounds of formula II and III as defined above in a solvent selected from alkyl esters or cyclic ethers.<br>
The use of said halogen-free solvents is advantageous compared with the use of halogenated solvents, since the former have a lower toxicity, comply with the European provisions concerning environment protection and allow to diminish of about 50% the industrial discharge costs.<br>
The invention provides therefore a process comprising:<br>
a)	radicalic bromination of compounds of formula II (in which R is as<br>
defined above) by means of a brominating agent in a halogen-free<br>
solvent selected from alkyl esters and cyclic ethers, in the presence of a<br>
radical initiator, to give compounds of formula (III), in which R has the<br>
above meaning;<br>
b)	dehydrobromination in a halogen-free solvent, with or without bases, to<br>
obtain the  compounds  of formula IV, in  which  R has  the  above<br>
meaning;<br>
c)	deprotection to obtain the compound of formula (I).<br>
A preferred R group is para-chloro-benzoyl.<br>
The brominating agent, which can be bromine or N-bromosuccinimide, N-bromo phtalimide, l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylidantoine, N-bromoacetamide, N-bromomaleimide, N-bromosulfonamide, is used in a molar excess ranging from 2 to 3 times compared with compound II. Bromine e N-bromosuccinimide are particularly preferred.<br>
Examples of halogen-free solvents for step a) comprise alkyl acetates such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl acetate or a cyclic aliphatic ether such as 1,4-dioxane, preferably in a ratio ranging from 3:1 to 12:1 compared with compound II. Ethyl acetate and 1,4-dioxane are particularly preferred.<br>
The solvent used for dehydrobromination (step b) is dimethylformamide or dimethyl acetamide or can be the same as that used in the bromination step. Ethyl'acetate and N,N-dimethylformamide are particularly preferred.<br>
2,2'-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile),<br>
2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile),	azobisisovaleronitrile,	1,1 '-azobis-<br>
(cyclohexancarbonitrile), 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, dimethyl 2,2'-azobisisobutirrate can be used as radical initiators. Azobisisonitriles are preferred, in particular AIBN.<br>
Said compounds are used in molar percentages ranging from 1 to 6% (3 and 6% for AIBN), compared with compound II.<br>
The reaction temperature ranges from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent and the reaction time ranges from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Preferred conditions comprise the reaction with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) in ethyl acetate at the boiling temperature of the solvent or the reaction with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of AIBN in 1,4 dioxane at a temperature ranging from 70 to 90 Â°C.<br>
Further to the economic advantages deriving from the lower discharge<br>
costs, the lower toxicity and the compliance with the regulations concerning<br>
environment protection, as above discussed, the process of the invention is<br>
also characterized by particularly high yields. This is particularly surprising, since it is known from chemical literature that the majority of the radicalic bromination reactions is usually carried out in halogenated solvents: for example, the already cited GB 2 125 399 describes only the use of chlorinated solvents for the synthesis of Brivudine, in accordance with the common general knowledge available in this technical field.<br>
Moreover, not all of the halogen-free solvents can be advantageously used in the process of synthesis and only some of them provide satisfactory results.<br>
For example, in the process for the preparation of Brivudine described in DE 2 915 254, the bromination of (E)-5-vinyl-uracile occurs in anhydrous dimethylformamide. Nevertheless, when dimethylformamide is used in the present process in the bromination step of the compounds of formula II, the 'conversion yields are surprisingly low and a number of not precisely identified by-products are formed. Another halogen free solvent sometimes used in radical brominations is acetonitrile (J.A.C.S. 1969 (91) 7398-740; J.A.C.S. 1971 (93) 5846-5850; J.A.C.S. 1974 (96)5616-5617), but also this solvent has not given satisfactory results in the bromination of compounds of formula II. Equally unacceptable results are obtained also with ether-like solvents such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane o methylcellosolve.<br>
The process according to the invention is further illustrated in the following examples.<br>
The starting intermediates of formula II (wherein R is as defined above) are prepared with a known method, as reported in GB 2 125 399.<br>

2.05 ml (6.33 g; 39.6 mmol) of bromine in 8 ml of ethyl acetate are dropped into the mixture depending on the consumption of the halogenating agent (discolouration of the mixture can be observed).

The mixture is heated at 80 Â°C and then a solution of 8.5 g (47.7 mmol) of N-bromosuccinimide in 35 ml of 1,4-dioxane is dropped in accordance with the reaction rate (about 30 minutes). After completion of the addition the solution is heated for further 15 minutes until it becomes colourless.
