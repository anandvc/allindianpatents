				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of creating a diamond-like carbon film on a metallic substrate. The present invention also relates to an article of manufacture.<br>
This invention relates to the field of chemical vapor deposition and more particularly to plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of high quality, diamond-like carbon films on partially-enclosed or highly-angled surfaces.<br>
Hard, thin films of hydrogenated, amorphous carbon (a-C:H), also called diamond-like carbon (DLC) films, can be created on metal surfaces by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) . Known PECVD processes which are used to create such films produce ions at low density (~1Q10 cm"3) . The known processes generate plasmas with sheath thicknesses that are wide (0.5-1.0 cm) and do not conform to small surface variations in the substrate (-0.1 mm). Therefore, ions which are accelerated across the sheath in the known processes do so perpendicularly to the macroscopic surface of the substrate. Under these conditions, angled substrate surfaces, such as razor blade edges (which typically have a spacing of 100 µm between the tips of blades in a stack) , are subject to oblique fluxes of reactive ions. These conditions are believed to cause self-shadowing of some of the depositing species, leading to columnar growth of a-C:H films. It is also believed that the low plasma density yields a relatively low ion-tc-atom ratio at the substrate surface. Deposition under conditions in which adatom surface<br>
mobility is poor, for example at low substrate temperatures (T/Traelt
The present invention is an improvement in the chemical vapor deposition of a-C:H films onto substrate surfaces, such as metallic substrate surfaces. Broadly, the invention includes the chemical vapor deposition of a-C:H films under conditions which provide conformal sheaths, high ion flux and controlled, low energy ion bombardment. The invention includes exposing a substrate to a hydrocarbon gas environment and generating plasma in the environment of an electron density greater than approximately 5 x 1010 per cm3 and a sheath thickness less than about 2 mm under conditions of high ion flux and controlled, low energy ion bombardment.<br>
Conditions of the invention which provide conformal sheaths, high ion flux and controlled, low energy ion bombardment include an ion current density (J1) greater than approximately 2 mA/cm2 and a bias voltage (-Vblas) within a range of approximately 100 to approximately 1000 Volts. Such conditions allow the formation of hard, dense diamond-like<br>
carbon (a-C:H) films onto needle poinus) razor blade edges, cutting bits and edges and other pointed, angled or sharp surfaces, or other partially-enclosed or high angle surfaces such a those found on certain writing instruments (pen nibs, pen ball seats, etc.), without the columnar growth of the' films associated with the other known processes.<br>
In particular, in one aspect of the invention, an inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition reactor in which the plasma power is controlled independently from the substrate bias, is used to dissociate a hydrocarbon feed gas such as C4H10. The substrate or workpieces, such as razor blades stacked side-by-side, are positioned inside the vacuum plasma chamber of the reactor on a chuck.<br>
The chuck is coupled to a radio frequency (RF) power source (e.g., 13.56 MHz) through an impedance matching network. Plasma is generated under conditions of maximized ion flux (i.e,, high RF power to the inductively coupled plasma) and moderate substrate bias (e.g., Ji&gt;~3mA/cm2 and -200V
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, an<br>
t<br>
interlayer can be used between the substrate and the diamond-like carbon film. This interlayer can be selected from the group consisting of silicon, silicon carbide, vanadium, tantalum, nickel, niobium, molybdenum, and alloys of such materials. Experience has demonstrated that silicon works particularly well as a material for such an interlayer.<br>
The high efficiency of the inductively coupled plasmacan produce an ion flux which can be approximately ten times greater than in a conventional RF capacitively coupled plasma.   These conditions produce advantages of reduced sheath width, increased ion-to-atom ratio, and a very high deposition rate.  The reduced sheath width allows conformal.. coverage  of  smaller structures and variations  in  the substrate surface.  The conformal sheath causes the ions to strike the surface perpendicularly or at low angles, leading to dense film.  The increased ron-to-atom ratio results in enhanced surface mobility for adatoms and deposition of higher density films.  The higher deposition rates, which occur because the plasma is more fully dissociated, result in faster throughput and cost savings.<br>
Because of these advantages, diamond-like carbon films can be generated which have a dense film structure (i e significantly reduced or no columnar grains or voids which decrease the mechanical strength [e.g., no discernable grains 300 A or greater in diameter when viewed at a magnification of 50,OOOX in a field-emission scanning electron microscope] ) and  high  hardness  (film  hardness  of  greater  "than approximately 20 GPa) at a high deposition rate, resulting m reduced cost per part.  The process can have additional advantages  which  can  include  self  sharpening  (sputter sharpening) of cutting edges due to the intense ion flux bombardment, high rate of chamber clean up using an oxygen Plasma, and rapid throughput during any.plasma precleaning step_ which may be employed prior to deposition.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of creating a diamond-like carbon film on a metallic substrate, comprising the steps of exposing the substrate to a hydrocarbon gas environment and generating plasma in said environment of an electron density and a sheath thickness, characterized in that the electron density is greater than 5 x 1010 - per cm3 and the sheath thickness is less than 1.7 mm and the plasma is generated under conditions of high ion flux and controlled, low energy ion bombardment, said conditions comprising an ion current greater than 3 mA/cm2 and a bias voltage applied to the substrate within a range of-200 to-500 volts.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to an article of<br>
manufacture obtainable by the method as claimed in any one of claims 1-5, comprising a substrate having an angled surface and a diamond-like carbon film on said surface, wherein said film has a hardness greater than 20 GPa and no discernible grains 3 x 10-8m (300 A) or greater in diameter when viewed at a magnification of 50,OOOX in a field-emission scanning electron microscope.<br>

The present invention provides an improvement in the formation of diamond-like carbon films on substrates by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. In accordance with the present invention, dissociation of a hydrocarbon gas by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition under conditions of high ion flux and controlled, low energy ion bombardment will form a hard, dense a-C:H film on a substrate without the -" kind of  columnar growth associated with other known processes, even if the substrate is oddly shaped or includes oblique angles. The invention includes exposing a substrate to a hydrocarbon gas environment and generating plasma in the environment of an electron density greater than approximately 5 x 10" per cm' and a sheath thickness less than about 2 mm under the conditions of high ion flux and controlled, low energy ion bombardment.  Such conditions can be attained through independent control of the density of the ion flux and the substrate bias to maximize the ion flux while<br>
maintaining moderate substrate bias. These conditions include an ion current (J1) greater than approximately 2 mA/cm2 and a bias voltage (-Vbias) within a range of approximately 100 to approximately 1000 volts.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, an inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor'deposition reactor is used to produce on an angled substrate the dense, hard a-<br>
1&gt;<br>
C:H film of the present invention. While the present invention is illustrated in terms of inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition, other plasma generating processes which are capable of producing high density plasma can also be used.<br>
.The inductively coupled reactor which can be used in the practice of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1. The reactor of Fig. 1 includes an induction plasma generator 10 coupled to a vacuum plasma chamber 12, in which a substrate chuck 14 is located in "the plasma field below a quartz window 11. Typically, chuck 14 would be water-cooled. Although water cooling is preferred, some heating is acceptable. Thus, a large thermal sink could also be used.<br>
The plasma generator 10 includes a radio frequency (RF) source 16 connected to induction coils 18 through capacitors 20. ^ Within the plasma chamber 12, the substrate.. or workpieces 22 (depicted as razor blades stacked side by side), are positioned on chuck 14. Chuck 14 is coupled to a radio frequency <rf power supply mhz through an impedance matching network the rf of chuck allows adjustment energy ions extracted from plasma to workpieces a></rf>
t<br>
hydrocarbon feed gas to be dissociated by the plasma is provided to the plasma chamber 12 through gas inlet 28. Typically, the feed gas will be C4H10, but other hydrocarbon gasses, such as CH4, C2H2, C6H6/ C2H6 and/or C3Ha/ can also be used. Preferably, the workpieces 22 are positioned 5 to 15 cm downstream (below the quartz window 11) and kept at room temperature by the water-cooled chuck 14.<br>

This rating corresponds to a semi " quantitative system for cacegorizing, blade edge coatings in which the microstructure of the coating is evaluated using field  emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  at  a Unification of 50.000X.  Based upon the appearance of 9ralns and void structure, a rating is assigned in accordance with the following table(Table Removed)<br>
The results of the above examples and other runs are shown in the graphs of Figs. 2 through 4. Pig. 2 graphically illustrates pertinent aspects of the present invention in terms of ion current/RF induction power, average substrate b,as voltage and sheath thickness. The figure also shows the region of the preferred embodiment of the present invention As can be seen in the figure, the magnitude of ion current affects the columnar growth of the films.  Lower  values Qf ion current result in increased growth of columnar films<br>
Higher values of ion current result in less columnar microstructure. Although not completely evident from the figure, wide plasma sheaths may also result in increased columnar microstructures.<br>
In    Fig.    2,    it    can   also   be   seen    that    the    average<br>
'|.<br>
substrate bias affects the hardness of the films. At lower average substrate bias values, the films are relatively soft. As the average bias values increase, the hardness of the films increases. However, excessively high substrate bias results in damaged films and a decrease in film hardness because of graphitization.<br>
Fig. 2 also demonstrates that the sheath thickness varies as a function of ion current density and substrate bias. As can be seen in Fig. 2, plasma sheath thickness increases as the substrate bias increases. Thus, as the substrate bias increases, the conformality of the plasma to the substrate decreases.<br>
The conditions in which advantages of the present invention occur include an ion current (JJ greater than approximately 2 mA/cm2 and an average substrate bias (-Vbias) within a range of approximately -100 to approximately -1000 volts, The conditions which produce the presently preferred embodiment (and which are shown in the large, upper highlighted portion of Fig. 2 labelled "PREFERRED") include an ion current (J1) greater than or equal to approximately 3 mA/cm2, an average substrate bias (Vbias) within a range of approximately -200 to approximately -500 volts, and sheath<br><br>
thickness less than or equal to approximately 1.7mm (for blades edges in a stacked configuration) .<br>
For comparison, the lower right, highlighted region of Fig. 2 (labelled "Conventional DLC"), outlines conditions and characteristics associated with capacitively coupled, low density chemical vapor depositlon;  <br>
An example of such<br>
conventional process conditions (RF powsr tosubstrate electrode) are as follows:<br>

energy of  ions at   the work piece, .     As can be seen   in  Fig.<br>
3. increased substrate bias and RP induction power increases film hardness. Again, excessively high substrate bias causes a decrease in film hardness because of graphitization.<br>
Fig.   4,   which shows  the hardness of  the  film produced" as  a  function of average substrate bias at 200-800 w of  Rp induction power, demonstrates that moderate average substrate bias    (e.g.,    approximately   -200   to   approximately   -500   v) produces  the films with the highest hardness.     Fig   4  also further   demonstrates   that   excessively high  substrate   bias "ill  decrease  the film hardness.     The  solid line  in Fig    4 -presents    a   best   fit    to    the   data.        Ihe   dashed    lines correspond to the 95% confidence limits of the fit.<br>
The following additional examples of PECVD on bla(Je edges demonstrate the effect of changes in induction Power/ion current on sheath width and columnar growth All conditions were fixed, except the induction power/ion current: (Table Removed) All runs at  5 mTorr C4H10,<br>
The results of these runs are shown in the Photomicrographs of Figs. 5-9 respectively, which were each taken at a magnification of 50.000X in . field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEN) . Columnar microstructure<br>
is readily apparent in the coatings of Pigs. 5 and 6, which correspond to Runs 1 and 2, respectively. The film shown in Fig. 7, which corresponds to Run 3, appears to be borderline, but columnarity is still evident.  No columnar structure (such as well-defined grains 300 A or greater in diameter in both the surface and cross-sectional images when viewed at 50,OOOX in the field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM)) is discernible in the films of Figs. 8 and 9, which correspond to Runs 4 and 5, respectively. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, a lower ion current limit of approximately 3 mA/cm2, corresponding to an induction power of approximately 400 W, has been chosen for the preferred embodiment.<br>
The photomicrographs of Figs. 10 through 13 further pictorially demonstrate the superior quality of a-C:H films deposited in accordance with the present invention. These photomicrographs were also taken at a magnification of 50,OOOX in a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) . Figs. 10 and 11 each show a-C:H film deposited on a razor blade edge by conventional capacitively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition techniques. Figs. 10 and 11 show well-defined grains and columnar growth of the a-C:H film on the blade edge.<br>
In contrast, Figs. 12 and 13 each show an a-C:H film deposited on the edge of a razor blade in accordance with the present invention. Figs. 12 and 13 clearly show good deposition of the film onto the blade edge without observable columnar growth or observable grains when viewed at 50,OOOX<br><br>
in the field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) No columnar microstructure or voids can be seen in the film deposited in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Further  illustrating  the  present  invention,  and demonstrating the increases in deposition rates associated<br>
v<br>
with the present invention, Fig. 14 is a graph depicting the deposition rate as a function of RF induction power. As the inductively coupled plasma is gradually turned on, the deposition rate increases considerably. At the origin of the plot, only RF bias is applied to the substrate, resulting in a deposition rate of 10 nm/minute and a self-bias of -300 V. This corresponds to capacitively coupled plasma vapor deposition. As induction power is increased, the bias power is adjusted to maintain -300 V. At 800 W of induction power, the deposition rate is approximately 170 nm/minute, which is about 17 times higher than conventional capacitively coupled plasma vapor deposition.<br>
In the examples of the invention described above, 13.56 MHz RF power was continuously applied to the substrate or workpieces to provide the substrate bias. In a further aspect of the invention, the bias power applied to the substrate or workpieces can be pulsed. Referring to Figs. 15A and 15B, the sine wave of the RF power supply 24 is modulated by a square wave from square wave generator 30 by modulator 32 to produce a pulsed RF bias voltage 34.<br>
In the embodiment of Figs. ISA and 15B, the duty-cycle is the bias on-time as a fraction of the total square-wave<br><br>
period. Varying the duty-cycle can have two advantages: i) the average bias voltage (ion energy) can be decreased but the peak voltage can be maintained in the optimal range, and 2) the sheath can relax to the zero-bias thickness (for example, approximately 30 urn) during the "off" period, which<br>
V<br>
can provide good conformal coverage of the workpiece during this period.<br>
Fig. 16 shows the effect of internal film stress on pulsed bias films as compared to continuous wave (CW) biased films. The pulsing technique allows reduction of film stress independently from hardness, a further unique feature of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, an interlayer can be used between the substrate and the diamond-like carbon film. This interlayer can be selected from the group consisting of silicon, silicon carbide, vanadium, tantalum, nickel, niobium, molybdenum, and alloys of such materials. Experience has demonstrated that silicon works particularly well as a material for such an interlayer.<br>
Fig. 17 shows an exemplary manufacturing process flow for the present invention. The workpieces would typically benefit from a precleaning step 36 to enhance the adhesion of the DLC layer. This can be performed in a single RF induction chamber (at high rates) or in a conventional DC glow discharge chamber (at lower rates and longer process times) . The preclean chamber can feed workpieces to two or more DLC deposition chambers 38 and 40 which use inductively<br>
coupled plasma sources. One of these chambers 38 can deoosit on the blade stack while the other chamber 40 is being cleaned. Cleaning is desirable because the film builds up on the chamber walls and eventually can delaminate, resulting in particulate contamination. A further exemplary process flow is outlined in the table below: Time Step Chamber A (36) Chamber B (38) Chamber C (40) (Table Removed)Exemplary process conditions for the process flows r iescribed above include the following: L)   Preclean Stack:<br>
