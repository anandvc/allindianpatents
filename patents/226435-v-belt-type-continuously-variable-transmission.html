				<td>V BELT TYPE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to aVbelt type continuously<br>
variable transmission which is constituted by coupling a drive<br>
pulley mounted on an input shaft, to which a torque is transmitted,<br>
and a driven pulley, which is mounted on an output shaft, with<br>
a V belt.<br>
Background Art<br>
For example, in a scooter type motorcycle, a V belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission may be adopted as a power<br>
transmission mechanism for transmitting an engine power to a<br>
rear wheel. In this type of V belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission, as shown in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), a structure<br>
is in general use in which a drive pulley 103, which is mounted<br>
on a crankshaft (input shaft) 100 and has a driving side fixed<br>
pulley half body 101 and a driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 102, and a driven pulley 107, which is mounted on an output<br>
shaft 104 and has a driven side fixed pulley half body 105 and<br>
a driven side movable pulley half body 106, are coupled by a<br>
V	belt 108.<br>
In the V belt type continuously variable transmission,<br><br>
a weight 109 moves the driving side movable pulley half body<br>
102 to the side of the f ixed pulley half body 101 with a centrifugal<br>
force as an engine speed increases, and with this movement,<br>
the driven side movable pulley half body 106 of the driven pulley<br>
107 moves in a direction apart from the fixed pulley half body<br>
105 while compressing a spring 110. Consequently, a winding<br>
diameter of the drive pulley 103 increases and a winding diameter<br>
of the driven pulley 107 decreases, and a reduction gear ratio<br>
decreases to a reduction gear ratio at top time which is a minimum<br>
reduction gear ratio. In this case, it is a general practice<br>
to regulate a position in axial direction of the driving side<br>
movable pulley half body 102 to a top time position by regulating<br>
a position in radial direction of the weight 109 (e.g., see<br>
JP-A-8-178003, JP-A-8-178004).<br>
However, in the case in which a structure for regulating<br>
a reduction gear ratio at top time on a drive pulley side as<br>
in the above-mentioned conventional transmission is adopted,<br>
a winding diameter of the drive pulley is reduced by an amount<br>
of abrasion of a V belt and, in accordance with this, a winding<br>
diameter on a driven pulley side increases. Therefore, there<br>
is a problem in that a reduction gear ratio deviates to the<br>
side of a reduction gear ratio at low time from the reduction<br>
gear ratio at top time, and a maximum speed decreases.<br>
For example, as shown in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), in the<br>
case in which an upper width dimension is reduced from L1 at<br><br>
the time when the V belt 108 is new to L1'due to abrasion of<br>
the V belt 108 when the motorcycle has traveled a certain distance<br>
D2 km, the winding diameter of the drive pulley 103 decreases<br>
from Rl in the top time position to Rl' by an amount of this<br>
abrasion and the winding diameter of the driven pulley 107<br>
increases from R2 to R2', and the reduction gear ratio increases<br>
from R2/R1 to R2'/R1' . As a result, since a vehicle speed at<br>
top time with the same engine decreases, the V belt has to be<br>
replaced even if an abrasion loss is within a tolerance. Thus,<br>
improvement is required in realizing extension of a replacement<br>
period.<br>
The present invention has been devised in view of the<br>
above-mentioned circumstances, and it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a V belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission which can restrain deviation of a reduction gear<br>
ratio due to abrasion of a V belt to secure a vehicle speed<br>
at the same engine speed and can extend a replacement period<br>
of the V belt.<br>

closed structure, which is formed independently from the<br>
crankcase 22, and has an elliptical shape covering most parts<br>
of the upper side of the crankcase 22 viewed from a right side<br>
thereof. The transmission case 45 includes a case main body<br>
45a of a bottomed box shape opening to the outer side in the<br>
crankshaft direction and a cover 45b closing the opening of<br><br>
the case main body 45a airtightly, and is tightened with and<br>
fixed to the second case 41 by a bolt 70. A gap "a" is provided<br>
between a bottom wall 45c of the case main body 45a and the<br>
second case 41, and heat from the engine 15 is restrained from<br>
transmitting to the transmission case 45 by this gap "a".<br>
An opening 41e having a size allowing the centrifugal<br>
clutch mechanism 17 to be taken in and out is formed on the<br>
axial direction of the second case 41. This opening 41e is<br>
closed by a clutch cover 71 airtightly, and the clutch cover<br>
71 is detachably tightened and fixed to an opening edge of the<br>
second case 41 by a bolt 72. Consequently, the centrifugal<br>
clutchmechanisml7 can be removed together with the transmission<br>
shaft 4 7 by removing the transmission case 4 5 together with<br>
a driven pulley 56 of the V belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission 16 and removing the clutch cover 71.<br>
The V belt type continuously variable transmission 16<br>
has a structure in which a drive pulley 55 is mounted on a right<br>
outer end of the crank shaft (input shaft) 28, a driven pulley<br>
56 is mounted on a right outer end of the transmission shaft<br>
(output shaft) 47, and a V belt 57 is wound around and coupled<br>
to both the pulleys 55, 56.<br>
The Vbelt 57 is a belt made of resin having heat resistance<br>
and durability and is formed by arranging a large number of<br>
resin blocks 57a of a lateral H shape and coupling these resin<br>
blocks with a pair of annular coupling members 57b made of<br><br>
heat-resistant rubber. Note that it is also possible to adopt<br>
a belt made of rubber as the V belt.<br>
The drive pulley 55 has a driving side fixed pulley half<br>
body 55a fixed to the right end of the crankshaft 28, and a<br>
driving side movable pulley half body 55b which is disposed<br>
so as to be slidable in an axial direction to the inner side<br>
in the crankshaft direction of the fixed pulley half body 55a<br>
and rotate together with the crankshaft 28 via a slide collar<br>
59.<br>
A cam plate 58 is disposed on the inner side in the<br>
crankshaft direction of the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 55b. This cam plate 58 and the slide collar 59 are mounted<br>
on the right end of the crankshaft 28 by spline fitting, and<br>
the driving side fixed pulley half body 55a is mounted on the<br>
outer side in the axial direction thereof and fastened and fixed<br>
by a lock nut 60. A cylindrical boss portion 55d, which is<br>
integrally formed with an axial part of the driving side movable<br>
pulley half body 55b, is mounted on the slide collar 59 so as<br>
to be movable in the axial direction. A cylindrical weight<br>
61 is disposed between the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 55b and the cam plate 58.<br>
The driven pulley 56 has a driven side fixed pulley half<br>
body 56a fixed to the right outer end of the transmission shaft<br>
47 and a driven side movable pulley haIf body 56b which is disposed<br>
on the outer side in the crankshaft direction of the fixed pulley<br><br>
half body 56a so as to be slidable in the axial direction.<br>
A cylindrical slide collar 62 is locked to an axial part<br>
of the driven side fixed pulley half body 56a, and the slide<br>
collar 62 is mounted on the transmission shaft 47 by spline<br>
fitting. A cylindrical boss portion 63 locked to an axial part<br>
of the driven side movable pulley half body 56b is mounted on<br>
this slide collar 62 so as to be movable in the axial direction.<br>
Plural slide grooves 63a extending in the axial direction<br>
is formed in the boss portion 63, and a guide pin 64, which<br>
is implanted and fixed to the slide collar 62, is engaged with<br>
the slide grooves 63a, whereby the driven side movable pulley<br>
half body 56b rotates together with the fixed pulley half body<br>
56a.<br>
A spring bearing member 65 consisting of an annular plate<br>
is fixed to an outer end of the slide collar 62 by a circlip<br>
65a, and a coil spring 67, which always biases the driven side<br>
movable pulley half body 56b to the side of the fixed pulley<br>
half body 56a, is provided between this spring bearing member<br>
65 and the driven side movable pulley half body 56b.<br>
As the rotation of the crankshaft 28 increases, the weight<br>
61 is moved to the outer side in the radial direction by a<br>
centrifugal force to move the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 55b to the outer side in the axial direction, whereby a<br>
winding diameter of the pulley increases. At the same time,<br>
the driven side movable pulley half body 56b compresses the<br><br>
coil spring 67 to move to the outer side in the axial direction,<br>
whereby the winding diameter of the pulley decreases and a<br>
reduction gear ratio decreases . In addition, when the rotation<br>
of the crankshaft 28 decreases, the weight 61 moves to the inner<br>
side in the radial direction to allow the movement of the driving<br>
side movable pulley half body 55b to the inner side in the axial<br>
direction, the driven side movable pulley half body 56b is biased<br>
by the coil spring 67 to move to the inner side in the axial<br>
direction, a winding diameter of the driven pulley 56 increases,<br>
whereby the winding diameter of the drive pulley 55 decreases<br>
and, as a result, a reduction gear ratio increases.<br>
The driven pulley 56 is fastened and fixed to the<br>
transmission shaft 4 7 by a lock nut 66 screwed into a tip 47a<br>
of the transmission shaft 47. This lock nut 66 is inserted<br>
and arranged so as to sink into an outer end 62a of the slide<br>
collar 62.<br>
Here, an inner diameter of the slide collar 62 is set<br>
to be larger stepwise than an outer diameter of the transmission<br>
shaft 47, and the tip 47a of the transmission shaft 47 is set<br>
to be smaller stepwise. Consequently, the lock nut 66 and a<br>
washer can be inserted and arranged in the outer ends 62a of<br>
the slide collar 62 without any trouble and, in this way, it<br>
becomes possible to locate the lock nut 66 on the inner side<br>
in the crankshaft direction than the spring bearing member 65<br>
of the coil spring 67. Since the transmission is constituted<br><br>
as described above, protrusion to the outer side in the<br>
transmission shaft direction can be reduced with a simple<br>
structure while a necessary length of the coil spring 67 is<br>
secured.<br>
Then, in the driven pulley 56, there is provided a driven<br>
side stopper which regulates a position in the axial direction<br>
of the driven side movable pulley half body 56b to a top time<br>
position when a space between the driven side movable pulley<br>
half body 56b and the driven side fixed pulley 56a is maximized.<br>
This driven side stopper is constituted so as to regulate the<br>
space of the driven pulley 56 to the space at top time by bringing<br>
an outer end surface 63b of the boss portion 63 of the driven<br>
side movable pulley half body 56b into abutment against the<br>
spring bearing member 65.<br>
Note that, as shown in Fig. 14, the driven side stopper<br>
may be constituted so as to regulate the space of the driven<br>
side pulley 56 to the space at the top time by bringing an end<br>
in axial direction 63a' of a slide groove 63a, which is formed<br>
in the boss portion 63 of the driven side movable pulley half<br>
body 56b, into abutment against the guide pin 64.<br>
In addition, in the drive pulley 55, there is provided<br>
a driving side stopper which regulates a position in the axial<br>
direction of the driving side variable pulley half body 55b<br>
to a corrected top time position (position shown in Fig. 5)<br>
where a space between the driving side movable pulley half body<br><br>
55b and the driving side fixed pulley half body 55a is smaller<br>
than the space in a top time position (position shown in Fig.<br>
4) where the space is minimized. This driving side stopper<br>
is constituted by integrally forming a stopper portion 55c,<br>
against which the weight 61 abuts, at an external periphery<br>
of the driving side movable pulley half body 55b on the inner<br>
side of the crankshaft direction, and regulates a position in<br>
the radial direction of the weight 61 with the stopper portion<br>
55c and the cam plate 58 to thereby regulate a space of the<br>
drive pulley 55 to a space at corrected top time. The stopper<br>
portion 55c is set such that a gap bis formed between the stopper<br>
portion 55c and the weight 61 in a state in which the V belt<br>
57 is substantially new and the driven side movable pulley 56b<br>
is regulated to the top time position.<br>
Next, actions and advantages of this embodiment will be<br>
described.<br>
Figs. 7 to 9 are characteristic chart for explaining<br>
operations as well as actions and advantages of this embodiment,<br>
respectively.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a relation between a travel distance and<br>
a change in an upper width dimension due to abrasion of a V<br>
belt. The upper width dimension of the V belt decreases as<br>
the travel distance increases. Note that an amount of abrasion<br>
of this V belt is substantially the same as that of the<br>
conventional one.<br><br>
Fig. 8 shows a relation between a travel distance and<br>
a reduction gear ratio at top time. In this embodiment, as<br>
the travel distance increases, first, the reduction gear ratio<br>
changes to be smaller and, when the travel distance has generally<br>
reached a certain travel distance Dl km, the reduction gear<br>
ratio is reversed to change to be larger. Moreover, when the<br>
travel distance has reached a travel distance D2 km, the<br>
reduction gear ratio returns to the original reduction gear<br>
ratio and, then, the reduction gear ratio changes to be larger.<br>
On the other hand, in the conventional transmission for<br>
regulating a top time position on the drive pulley side, the<br>
reduction gear ratio changes to be larger as the travel distance<br>
increases from an initial stage.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a relation between a travel distance and<br>
an engine speed at top time. As described above, in the<br>
conventional transmission, since the reduction gear ratio<br>
deviates to be larger from an initial stage, it is necessary<br>
to increase the engine speed in order to obtain a predetermined<br>
vehicle speed. On the other hand, in this embodiment, since<br>
the reduction gear ratio changes to be smaller up to the vicinity<br>
of the certain travel distance Dl km, the predetermined vehicle<br>
speed is obtained even at a low engine speed. In addition,<br>
the predetermined vehicle speed is obtained without increasing<br>
the engine speed until the travel distance exceeds the travel<br>
distance D2 km.<br><br>
At an idling time, the drive pulley 55 is in a position<br>
at low time where the space between the pulley half bodies is<br>
maximized and the winding diameter is minimized, and the driven<br>
pulley 56 is in a position at low time where the space between<br>
the pulley half bodies is minimized and the winding diameter<br>
is maximized by a biasing force of the coil spring 67, whereby<br>
the reduction gear ratio is maximized.<br>
When the rotation of the crankshaft 28 increases, the<br>
weight 61 moves the driving side movable pulley half body 55b<br>
to the side of the fixed pulley half body 55a with a centrifugal<br>
force, whereby the winding diameter of the drive pulley 55<br>
gradually increases and the driven side movable pulley half<br>
body 56b compresses the coil spring 67 to move to the side of<br>
the fixed pulley half body 56a, the winding diameter of the<br>
driven pulley 56 gradually decreases and the reduction gear<br>
ratio gradually decreases.<br>
When the rotation of the crankshaft 28 further increases,<br>
the driving side movable pulley half body 55b is moved by the<br>
centrifugal force of the weight 61 and the winding diameter<br>
of the drive pulley 55 further increases and, in accordance<br>
with this, the driven side movable pulley half body 56b moves<br>
to the outer side in the axial direction, and the outer end<br>
surface 63b of the boss portion 63 of the driven side movable<br>
pulley half body 56b abuts against the spring bearing member<br>
65. Consequently, the driven pulley 56 is regulated to the<br><br>
top time position where the winding diameter is minimized. In<br>
this case, as shown in Fig. 4, when the travel distance is zero<br>
or at the initial stage, the gap b exists between the weight<br>
61 and the stopper portion 55c of the driving side movable pulley<br>
half body 55b.<br>
As the travel distance increases, the V belt 57 is worn<br>
as shown in Fig. 7, and the upper width dimension of the belt<br>
decreases. For example, when the travel distance reaches Dl<br>
km, the upper width dimension of the V belt 57 decreases from<br>
L1 at the time when the V belt is new to L1' . Then, the driving<br>
side movable pulley half body 55b moves to the side of the fixed<br>
pulley half body 55a by an amount of abrasion and the winding<br>
diameter of the drive pulley 55 slightly increases from Rl at<br>
the initial stage to Rl' , the weight 61 abuts against the stopper<br>
portion 55c, and the winding diameter increases to the winding<br>
diameter at corrected top time larger than that at top time<br>
to be regulated to this winding diameter.<br>
On the other hand, since the driven side movable pulley<br>
half body 56b of the driven pulley 56 is regulated to the top<br>
time position, the V belt 57 moves to the axis side and the<br>
winding diameter slightly decreases from R2 at the initial stage<br>
to R2' . In this way, as shown in Fig. 8, the reduction gear<br>
ratio changes to be smaller by an amount of abrasion of the<br>
V belt 57.<br>
When the travel distance has reached D2 km and the upper<br><br>
width dimension of the V belt 57 further decreases from LI at<br>
the time when the V belt is new to L1' since the driving side<br>
movable pulley half body 55b is regulated to the top time, the<br>
Vbelt 57 moves to the axis side and the winding diameter returns<br>
to Rl' ' which is substantially equal to Rl at the initial stage.<br>
On the other hand, the driven side movable pulley half body<br>
56b on the drive pulley 56 side moves to the side of the fixed<br>
pulley half body 56a by a biasing force of the coil spring 67<br>
by an amount of abrasion of the V belt 57, whereby the winding<br>
diameter of the driven pulley 56 returns to R2' which is<br>
substantially equal to R2 at the initial stage.<br>
That is, the reduction gear ratio changes to be smaller<br>
from the state in which the V belt 57 is new up to the vicinity<br>
of the travel distance Dl km and, when the travel distance has<br>
exceeded Dl km, the reduction gear ratio starts to change to<br>
be larger in the vicinity of D2 km. When the travel distance<br>
further increases from this state, the reduction gear ratio<br>
gradually changes to be larger.<br>
In this way, in this embodiment, since the driven side<br>
movable pulley half body 56b of the driven pulley 56 is regulated<br>
to the top time position where the winding diameter is minimized,<br>
in the period until the travel distance reaches, for example,<br>
Dl km as described above, the winding diameter of the drive<br>
pulley 55 changes to be larger in accordance with the increase<br>
in the travel distance and the winding diameter of the driven<br><br>
pulley 56 changes to be smaller, whereby the reduction gear<br>
ratio changes to be smaller. In addition, since the driving<br>
side movable pulley half body 55b on the drive pulley 55 side<br>
is regulated to the corrected top time position, when the travel<br>
distance further increases exceeding Dl km, although the<br>
reduction gear ratio has been changing to be smaller to that<br>
point, the reduction gear ratio is reversed and changes to return<br>
to the original reduction gear ratio. As a result, the vehicle<br>
speed at top time does not decrease to the lower limit value<br>
even if the amount of abrasion of the V belt 57 increases<br>
considerably, the V belt 57 is not required to be changed at<br>
an amount of abrasion equivalent to that in the past, and the<br>
replacement period of the Vbelt can be extended. Incidentally,<br>
a standard for replacement of a V belt is set to a time when<br>
the travel distance has reached D2 km in the conventional<br>
transmission, whereas, in this embodiment, the replacement<br>
period is a time when the travel distance has reached D3 km.<br>
In this embodiment, the top time position of the driven<br>
side movable pulley half body 56b is regulated by bringing the<br>
boss portion 63 of the driven side movable pulley half body<br>
56b into abutment against the spring bearing member 65, and<br>
the top time position of the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 55b is regulated by bringing the weight 61 into abutment<br>
against the stopper portion 55c of the driving side movable<br>
pulley half body 55b. Therefore, the driven side movable pulley<br><br>
half body 56b and the driving side movable pulley half body<br>
55b can be regulated to the top time position and the corrected<br>
top time position with a simple structure without providing<br>
a separate component or a special stopper mechanism, and an<br>
increase in cost can be prevented.<br>
Figs. 10 to 12 are views for explaining the driving side<br>
stopper according to the present invention. In the figure,<br>
reference numerals and signs identical with those in Figs. 4<br>
to 6 denote identical or equivalent components.<br>
The driving side stopper of this embodiment is an example<br>
in which a projecting portion 55e is formed on an outer end<br>
surface of the boss portion 55d of the driving side movable<br>
pulley half body 55b, and the projecting portion 55e is brought<br>
into abutment against a boss portion 55f of the fixed pulley<br>
half body 55a, whereby the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 55b is regulated to the corrected top time position.<br>
In such a case, the driving side movable pulley half body<br>
55b can also be regulated to the corrected top time position<br>
with a simple structure without providing a separate component<br>
or a special stopper mechanism, and the same advantages as the<br>
above-mentioned embodiment can be obtained. Inaddition, since<br>
a structure for bringing the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body 55b into abutment against the fixed pulley half body 55a<br>
to regulate it to the top time position is adopted, a pressing<br>
force can be prevented from acting on the V beIt 57 by a centrifugal<br><br>
force of the weight 61, and abrasion of the V belt 57 can be<br>
restrained.<br>
Note that, although the case in which the present invention<br>
is described with the case in which it is applied to a V belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission of a motorcycle as an<br>
example in the above-mentioned embodiment, a scope of<br>
application of the present invention is not limited to this,<br>
and the present invention can be applied to a V belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission for a vehicle such as a motor<br>
tricycle or a four wheel car.<br>
In addition, although the present invention is described<br>
with a V belt of resin as an example in the above-mentioned<br>
embodiment, the present invention can be naturally applied to<br>
a V belt of rubber, and substantially the same advantages as<br>
the above-mentioned embodiment can be obtained in this case.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
In the V belt type continuously variable transmission<br>
in accordance with the invention of claim 1 and in accordance<br>
with claim 2, since a reduction gear ratio at time when the<br>
drive pulley has a maximum winding diameter and the driven pulley<br>
has a minimum winding diameter and the number of rotations of<br>
an input shaft necessary for obtaining the same number of<br>
rotations of an output shaft decrease once and, then, increase<br>
in accordance with an increase in an operating time, respectively,<br><br>
an operating time until a rotating speed of the output shaft<br>
decreases to a lower limit value becomes long compared with<br>
the conventional transmission and, therefore, a replacement<br>
period of a V belt can be extended.<br>
In the invention of claims 3 and 4, the driven side movable<br>
pulley half body on the driven pulley side is regulated to the<br>
position where the winding diameter is minimi zed, and the driving<br>
side movable pulley half body on the drive pulley side is<br>
regulatedto the position where the winding diameter is maximized<br>
Thus, when the V belt is worn in accordance with an increase<br>
in an operating time from start of operation, the space of the<br>
driven pulley does not change and the driving side movable pulley<br>
moves from the regulated position to narrow the space of the<br>
drive pulley, and the winding diameter is increased. Therefore,<br>
the reduction gear ratio changes to be smaller.. In addition,<br>
after the driving side movable pulley has reached the regulated<br>
position in accordance with an increase in an amount of abrasion<br>
of the V belt, the reduction gear ratio changes to increase<br>
in accordance with a further increase in the amount of abrasion.<br>
In this way, in accordance with an increase in the operating<br>
time, the reduction gear ratio changes to be smaller once,<br>
changes to return to the initial reduction gear ratio, and,<br>
then, changes to increase, whereby the number of rotations of<br>
the output shaft does not decrease to a lower limit value until<br>
the amount of abrasion of the Vbelt becomes considerably large.<br><br>
As a result, a replacement period of the V belt can be extended.<br>
In the invention of claim. 5, the driven side stopper is<br>
constituted by bringing the boss portion of the driven side<br>
movable pulley half body against the spring bearing member.<br>
In the invention of claim 8, the driven side stopper is<br>
constituted by bringing the end in axial direction of the slide<br>
groove of the driven side movable pulley half body. Therefore,<br>
the driven side movable pulley half body can be regulated to<br>
the top time position with a simple structure without providing<br>
a separate component or a special stopper mechanism, and an<br>
increase in cost can be prevented.<br>
In the invention of claim 6, the driving side stopper<br>
is constituted by bringing the weight into abutment against<br>
the stopper portion formed in the outer edge of the driving<br>
side movable pulley half body to regulate the position in radial<br>
directionof the weight. In the invention of claim 7, thedriving<br>
side stopper is constituted by bringing the boss portion of<br>
the driving side movable pulley half body into abutment against<br>
the boss portion of the driving side fixed pulley half body.<br>
Therefore, as in claim 3, the driving side movable pulley half<br>
body can be regulated to the top time position with a simple<br>
structure without providing a separate component or a special<br>
stopper mechanism.<br><br>
