				<td>METHOD AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS UNIT FOR CHOOSING A SYSTEM<br>
SELECTION ALGORITHM<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates in general to communication equipment, and more specifically to a<br>
method and device for choosing a system selection algorithm that is dependent on the device location.<br>
Background Art<br>
Communications systems and equipment are known. Systems provided by many different<br>
carriers operating according to many different access technologies on many different frequencies have<br>
become available and deployed. In many areas multiple systems are available to provide services for a<br>
wireless communications unit or subscriber unit. The systems that are available within a given area<br>
may change over time.<br>
When a wireless communications unit is activated or powered up or enters a new area the unit<br>
typically uses a system selection algorithm to locate or select a system and attempt to access that<br>
system. The system selection algorithm is used to search for a system, specifically tune the unit to<br>
various frequencies and determine whether an expected or compatible signal is present e.g. can be<br>
received. Finding the correct signal, thus system, can be a time consuming and thus power consuming<br>
task given the proliferation of differing systems.<br>
Practitioners have devoted significant efforts to improving a system selection algorithm<br>
including various priority schemes that may improve the chances of finding the proper system but are<br>
still time and power consuming approaches. Others have used location information to assist with call<br>
management decisions including choosing a cell site, frequency, or perhaps cellular system. This may<br>
provide some benefit provided the communications systems that are available are known on an apriori<br>
basis and so long as the available systems do not change.<br>
Clearly a need exists for apparatus and methods that can quickly and efficiently locate and<br>
select the proper system to provide service to wireless communications units.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In overview, the present disclosure concerns communications systems that provide<br>
services and specifically communications services such as cellular phone services to wireless<br>
communications units or subscriber units or devices and users thereof. More particularly<br>
various inventive concepts and principles embodied in apparatus and methods for providing or<br>
choosing a system selection algorithm at a subscriber or wireless communications unit are<br>
discussed and described. The communications systems and units of particular interest are those<br>
being deployed and developed commonly known as GSM (Group Special Mobile), GPRS<br>
(General Packet Radio System), IS-95 CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDMA 2000,<br>
integrated digital enhanced network (IDEN), 2.5G or EDGE, and 3G or W-CDMA (Wideband<br>
CDMA) (UMTS) systems or variations and evolutions thereof that are suitable for providing<br>
services to wireless communications units. As further discussed below various inventive<br>
principles and combinations thereof are advantageously employed to choose or pick a system<br>
selection algorithm dependent upon location in a fashion that improves selection or scan times at<br>
the wireless communications unit, thus alleviating various problems, such as undue battery<br>
consumption associated with known approaches while still facilitating appropriate system<br>
selection, provided these principles or equivalents thereof are utilized.<br>
The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the best<br>
modes of making and using various embodiments in accordance with the present invention. The<br>
disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and appreciation for the inventive<br>
principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention. The<br><br>
invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any amendments made during the<br>
pendency of this application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as first and second,<br>
top and bottom, and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another entity or action<br>
without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such<br>
entities or actions. Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles are<br>
best implemented with or in software programs or instructions and integrated circuits (ICs) such<br>
as application specific ICs. It is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly<br>
significant effort and many design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current<br>
technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed<br>
herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs and ICs<br>
with minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of any risk<br>
of obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention, further discussion of<br>
such software and ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials with respect to the principles and<br>
concepts used by the preferred embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 a simplified and exemplary system diagram for setting the context<br>
within which the preferred embodiments operate will be discussed and described. FIG 1 shows<br>
two distinct geographical areas 101, 103. It is understood that additional areas are available in<br>
the actual environment. Perhaps each geographical area represents a different metropolitan<br>
region, such as New York, London, or Dallas. Within each geographical area there are a<br>
plurality of systems, where a particular service provider or carrier may operate each system.<br>
Geographical area 101 includes system A 105, system B 107 and system C 109. Geographical<br>
area 103 includes system C 111, system D 113 and system B' 115. Additionally system A 117<br>
is shown with a dotted line to signify that this system will become available in geographical area<br>
103 in the near future. System B' 115 is intended to represent a system affiliated with and<br>
having cross billing agreements with System B. It is understood that many additional systems<br>
(not depicted) may be available in many metropolitan areas.<br>
Each of these systems 105-109 provides services to appropriately equipped wireless<br>
communications units within a service area generally identified by the corresponding perimeter<br>
lines. Similarly each of the systems 111-113 provide services to appropriately equipped<br>
wireless communications units within a service area generally identified by the corresponding<br>
perimeter lines. The service areas in respective geographical areas 101, 102 overlap in total or<br>
in part as shown implying that service may be available from a plurality of systems for any one<br>
wireless communications unit over much or all of a geographical area. Furthermore, each<br><br>
system may have varying coverage capability across the depicted geographic area. For example,<br>
one system might be better equipped than another to handle in-building calls in certain portions<br>
of the, respective, service area due, for example, to specific or preferred placements of cells.<br>
The catch is that a wireless communications unit must look or scan for the appropriate<br>
system in order to access it. Generally, scanning for the proper system amounts to the wireless<br>
communications unit tuning a receiver to one or more appropriate system specific frequencies<br>
and looking for or attempting to receive system specific characteristics, such as type of<br>
modulation and other signaling characteristics that will depend on the access technology, such as<br>
TDMA, CDMA, FDMA and variants thereof that are used by a system not to mention system<br>
identifiers and other information that must be decoded all as generally known.<br>
This is complicated by the availability of different systems in different geographical<br>
areas as well as different frequencies for different geographical areas for the same system or<br>
carrier. Furthermore, there are many reasons why a given user, thus wireless communications<br>
unit may prefer one system over another. For example, different tariff rates or charges may<br>
apply to services on different systems. For example, a home system or a system affiliated with a<br>
home system may offer better pricing than other systems. Different systems may offer different<br>
services, such a voice only, voice and data, Internet or other packet data connections, or other<br>
wideband services and the like. It has proven difficult to develop a single system selection<br>
algorithm that is efficient in terms of time and power consumption to deal with the variations<br>
that may be experienced between different geographical areas or even within a given area since<br>
all carriers may not provide coverage or uniform coverage throughout an area. The present<br>
invention discusses an advantageous solution that associates or uses location of a wireless<br>
communications unit to choose or select a system selection algorithm that is optimized for the<br>
unit's needs at or near a given location.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a basic block diagram of a preferred embodiment of a wireless<br>
communications unit will be discussed and described. This wireless communications unit block<br>
diagram is similar to most cellular phones or handsets such as those available from various<br>
manufacturers, such as Motorola, except for the additional and inventive elements and processes<br>
herein described. The functions of many of the blocks are similarly known and will not be<br>
dwelled upon. Wireless communications units that are able to utilize multiple access<br>
technologies may have relatively more complicated functional blocks but these are also known.<br>
Generally, the block diagram of FIG. 2 depicts a wireless communications unit 200 that is<br>
arranged and constructed for, among other communications functions, choosing a system<br>
selection algorithm where the system selection algorithm that is chosen is dependent on location<br><br>
of the unit and is used for selecting a system to provide service for the wireless communications<br>
unit.<br>
As depicted, the communications unit includes an antenna structure 201 that may be<br>
tunable to one or more frequency bands for radiating radio frequency signals from a transmitter<br>
203 and absorbing or receiving radio frequency signals for a receiver 205. The receiver and<br>
transmitter are each coupled to a frequency generation unit (FGU) 207 that includes for example<br>
one or more known frequency synthesizers that generate signals with frequencies that determine<br>
what frequency the receiver is tuned to or what frequency the transmitter transmits on. The<br>
FGU 207, receiver 205 and transmitter 207 are inter coupled to a controller 209 (controller and<br>
signal processor) by a control signal bus. Additionally the receiver provides a received or base<br>
band signal to the controller for received signal processing or decoding and a transmit base band<br>
signal is provided by the controller to the transmitter for transmission as required. The<br>
controller 209 operates Jo control the FGU, transmitter, and receiver and provide proper signals<br>
to and from the transceiver.<br>
The controller 209 is also inter coupled to a user interface 211 that includes, for example,<br>
a display 213, a keyboard 215, a speaker 217 or earpiece, a microphone 219. and other user<br>
interface devices 221 such as a vibratory alert apparatus all generally known. These elements<br>
operate as generally known to provide control and utility to a user of the communications unit.<br>
The user interface will support, via the display and keyboard, user discretionary decisions and<br>
inputs as further noted below. The controller may also be coupled to a Geo-synchronous<br>
Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver 223 as one means for associating a location with the<br>
wireless communications unit.<br>
In any event the controller 209 comprises a processor 225 that is preferably one or more<br>
microprocessors and digital signal processors suitable to perform the control and signal<br>
processing functions of the wireless communications unit. The controller further comprises a<br>
memory 227, coupled to the processor, that is preferably a combination of RAM, ROM,<br>
EEPROM or magnetic based memory. The memory 227 stores software instructions and data<br>
that when executed and utilized by the processor results in the controller 209 controlling the<br>
wireless communications device and processing signals appropriately. The memory includes a<br>
basic operating system 229, operating variables and data 231, a plurality of system selection<br>
algorithms 233, a cross reference of system selection algorithms with location, SSA (location)<br>
235, and various other routines 237 not specifically depicted such as a routine that supports over<br>
the air updating and configuring of system selection algorithms and parameters and routines<br>
required to control the wireless communications unit that are not here relevant but will be<br><br>
understood by one of ordinary skill.<br>
Generally, the controller 209, specifically the processor executing the proper instructions<br>
or routines, when coupled to the means for associating a location, operates to choose one system<br>
selection algorithm from a plurality of system selection algorithms based on the location of the<br>
wireless communications unit to provide a chosen algorithm. The means for associating a<br>
location with the wireless communications unit can includes means for obtaining location<br>
parameters from either the GPS receiver 233, if available, or from a user of the wireless<br>
communications unit or other known means such as triangulation. For example the user via a<br>
pull down menu can select Chicago, New York, Chicago 1, or Chicago 2. This information<br>
would be used as an input to the SSA (location) 235 routine which would point to the<br>
appropriate system selection algorithm 1, 2,..., n 233.<br>
The chosen algorithm may include system types, frequency bands, scan parameters, such<br>
as one or more of scan sensitivities, thresholds, timing parameters, etc. one or more of which<br>
will vary with the location or an algorithm structure that varies with the location. The algorithm<br>
structure includes variations in the flow or logic of the algorithm, such as search for the n<br>
frequencies or m frequencies with the strongest signals or search all frequencies associated with<br>
a system and then attempt to decode the signal starting with the strongest signal. The receiver<br>
205 that is coupled to and controllable by the controller will be controlled to operate according<br>
to the chosen algorithm to search for a system to provide service for the wireless<br>
communications unit. Thus when a second location is associated with the wireless<br>
communications unit the controller provides a second chosen algorithm with scan parameters<br>
that correspond to the second location.<br>
Preferably, the controller determines the chosen algorithm that is applicable at a<br>
particular location to correspond to either availability of differing systems or desirability of<br>
differing systems that may provide services at the particular location. For example system D 113<br>
and B' 115 are not available at geographic area 101. The desirability of the differing systems,<br>
meaning one system being more desirable than another, may be based on access technology<br>
capabilities of the wireless communications unit. For example, a unit capable of analog<br>
operation and IS-95 CDMA at 800 MHz or 1.6GHz may prefer to operate at 1.6GHz if a system<br>
is available. The desirability or relative desirability of the differing systems may as well be<br>
based on either tariff rates for the differing systems or specific services supported by the<br>
differing systems. Presumably the least expensive system would be preferred however if large<br>
of amounts of data are likely to be transferred then a more expensive system or at least one with<br>
appropriate services would be preferred.<br><br>
The wireless communications unit, specifically the controller, may determine the chosen<br>
algorithm as either an algorithm that initially searches for a home system or an algorithm that<br>
foregoes a search for the home system. The plurality of system selection algorithms will<br>
preferably use one or more different system acquisition parameters to control scanning,<br>
camping, and rescanning attributes for the wireless communications unit. These differing<br>
system acquisition parameters may include one or more of a signal strength for acquisition, a<br>
signal strength for rescanning, a signal strength for camping, or a timing parameter for scanning,<br>
such as dwell time, rescan times or how often to rescan for another system and so forth.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an exemplary table 300 depicting a plurality of differing system<br>
selection algorithms with differing scan parameters will be discussed and described. FIG. 3<br>
shows three system selection algorithms, 303, 305, and 307 and a geographical area 309 where<br>
each is applicable. System selection algorithm 303 and 307 are applicable in geographical area<br>
101 and system selection algorithm 305 is applicable in area 103. Generally, the information<br>
included in 309 together with 303-307 is the same as that is SSA (location) 235. The reason for<br>
two system selection algorithms associated with one geographical area, namely 101 is likely a<br>
tradeoff between tariff rates and services. Note that the table 300 is exemplary only and has<br>
been fashioned with ease of depiction and description in mind. For example, the various<br>
systems 311, system A, system B or B, system C, system D, etc are listed in order vertically<br>
along the left hand side of the Figure. Generally, the algorithm is expected to be executed from<br>
top to bottom, meaning with this depiction the systems are searched for from A to D, etc. In<br>
practice, this is not generally the case and the systems may be searched for in any desired order.<br>
Additionally not specifically shown is an algorithm structure or flow or logic that may vary from<br>
algorithm to algorithm, where the structure specifies the mechanics or logic of the search, such<br>
as how many signals and what signal characteristics will be searched. Nevertheless, the<br>
structure as depicted is suitable for explaining the general principles, content, and concepts<br>
embodied in a system search algorithm.<br>
System selection algorithm 303 is designed for a wireless communications unit to search<br>
for and is biased in favor of selecting system A with access technology X, such as TDMA,<br>
CDMA, etc. Generally, the wireless communications unit will scan the frequency list for system<br>
A, specifically FA ... using system acquisition parameters or attributes including scan<br>
parameters, such as a sensitivity or scan signal strength of s1 and dwell time on each channel of<br>
t1 After selection and access, if the signal strength on the channel drops by an amount d1 (for a<br>
period of time that may also be a parameter) e.g. to a rescan signal strength, a rescan will occur<br>
using the same system selection algorithm. The signal strength values may as well be replaced<br><br>
by another indicia of channel quality such as bit error rates or frame error rates or the like. The<br>
specific values for signal strength, dwell times, and rescan signal strengths will depend on the<br>
access technology and system designs and will normally be known to those of ordinary skill else<br>
may be experimentally determined. Presumably, the bias toward system A is due to favorable<br>
tariff rates for appropriate services, here Voice services only, such as may be available if system<br>
A is the home system for the wireless communications unit.<br>
Note that when the search for system A is not successful on an initial scan or on a rescan,<br>
a search for system B will occur using the frequency list for system B, FB ... and system<br>
acquisition parameters and scan parameters including a scan signal strength s4, dwell time t4, a<br>
camping signal strength or variation or delta from the scanning signal strength d4, a rescan signal<br>
strength as well as rescan timing parameter of time period 15. In this instance if the signal<br>
strength deteriorates by an amount d4 then every ts seconds a rescan will occur or by an amount<br>
d5 then immediately a rescan will occur. Again the bias is torescan and reselect or get back to<br>
system A. Note that expanded services are available, specifically voice and data, if system B is<br>
acquired or selected. An analogous situation holds for system C if system A and B can not be<br>
accessed. In area 101 system D is not available and will not be searched for with the first<br>
system selection algorithm 303. Note that if expanded services, such as voice and data and the<br>
like are desired by the user of the wireless communications unit then system selection algorithm<br>
307 may be used to locate or search for and select system B or system C. This may be done<br>
with a pull down menu for the user that shows different combinations of service and allows the<br>
user to select the desired one.<br>
Suppose the wireless communications unit travels to the geographical area 103. In this<br>
instance, the system selection algorithm 305 should be used given the location as noted above.<br>
Here, the preferred system A 117 is not or may not yet be operational. Since it is not known<br>
when it will go operational the system selection algorithm accounts for the possibility and scans<br>
a frequency list that may be different than the list in area 101 and may be an abbreviated list.<br>
Also, the system acquisition parameters including other scan parameters may vary from those<br>
used in system selection algorithm 303. For example, the scan sensitivity or signal strength s2<br>
may be larger or the dwell time t2 may be shorter than the corresponding values for the<br>
algorithm 303. Furthermore, the camping signal strength is specified, and the rescan signal<br>
strength may be different and rescan timing parameter or time period is specified. Note that<br>
system A, if located, is expected to have expanded services in area 103 relative to 101. In any<br>
even:, if system A is not located then system B' will be searched for or accessed. Note that<br>
system B' has a different access technology and fewer services than system B. System B' may<br><br>
be a system that is affiliated with system B bv virtue of some agreement between carriers for the<br>
two systems.<br>
The unit supplier or service provider, in view of the user's desires and other<br>
circumstances, may program the specific system selection algorithms into the wireless<br>
communications unit. Present device, terminal, or unit management techniques allow updating<br>
and reconfiguration of the devices over the air. Alternatively, an algorithm programming utility<br>
may be provided such that the user can program the algorithms. This is preferably arranged to<br>
be a menu driven routine where the user selects an access technology and low, medium, or high<br>
values for relative system preference or desirability, plus desired services information.<br>
Reasonable values for signal strengths and scanning timing parameters can be established from<br>
these minimal inputs in order to generate practical system selection algorithms that will<br>
normally find the proper system and at the same time be reasonable time and power efficient.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4 a flow chart of a preferred method embodiment of choosing a system<br>
selection algorithm will be discussed and described. Much of this discussion will be in the<br>
nature of a review as many of the concepts and principles have been discussed above. FIG. 4<br>
shows a method 400 in a wireless communications unit of choosing a system selection<br>
algorithm, where the system selection algorithm is used in selecting a system to provide service<br>
for the wireless communications unit. The method begins at 403 by determining a location for<br>
or associating a location with the wireless communications unit. The determining a location for<br>
the wireless communications unit may include or be accomplished by obtaining location<br>
parameters from a GPS receiver or directly from a user of the wireless communications unit.<br>
Then 405 indicates choosing one system selection algorithm from a plurality of system<br>
selection algorithms based on the location to provide a chosen algorithm. The chosen algorithm<br>
will include one or more scan parameters that vary with the location. The choosing one system<br>
selection algorithm mayjnclude choosing an algorithm, such as system selection algorithm 303,<br>
that initially searches for a home system or an algorithm, such as system selection algorithm<br>
307, that foregoes a search for the home system or system A. Each of the plurality of system<br>
selection algorithms is expected to be applicable at a particular location and corresponds in one<br>
manner or another to either availability of differing systems or desirability of differing systems.<br>
For example, the plurality of system selection algorithms may correspond to the<br>
desirability of the differing systems according to access technology capabilities of the wireless<br>
communications unit. For example if the wireless communications unit is not able to search for<br>
a receive signals with access technology Z, such as system D uses, that system or search<br>
parameters for that system would not show up in a system search algorithm for that wireless<br><br>
communications unit. The plurality of system selection algorithms may also correspond to the<br>
desirability of the differing systems according to or based on relative tariff rates for the differing<br>
systems or based on supported services, such as voice, data, video, Internet interconnect.<br>
At any rate 407 shows, after having selected the algorithm, using the chosen algorithm to<br>
search for and select a system to provide service for the wireless communications unit. Note<br>
that each of the plurality of system selection algorithms may use differing system acquisition<br>
parameters to control one or more of initial acquisition, camping, and rescanning attributes for<br>
the wireless communications unit. As noted above with reference to FIG.3, the different system<br>
acquisition parameters may include one or more of a signal strength for acquisition, a signal<br>
strength for rescanning, a signal strength for camping, and timing parameters for scanning. If<br>
the system is lost or a rescan parameter is satisfied as determined at 407, 409 determines<br>
whether the location has changed and if so the process begins again at 403 and if not, the process<br>
searches again at 407 using the same algorithm.<br>
The processes and apparatus discussed above and the inventive principles thereof are<br>
intended to and will alleviate problems caused by prior art system selection algorithms. Using<br>
these principles of choosing an algorithm based on location information for the wireless<br>
communications unit will enable a user of a communications unit, such as a cellular handset to<br>
enjoy not only selection of the most desirable system but also performance benefits such as<br>
quicker and more appropriate system acquisition as well as longer battery life thus facilitating<br>
user satisfaction. It is expected that one of ordinary skill given the above described principles,<br>
concepts and examples will be able to implement other alternative procedures that are subscriber<br>
or wireless unit or system characteristic dependent and that will also offer or facilitate similar<br>
performance benefits. It is expected that the claims below cover most such alternatives.<br>
This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various embodiments in<br>
accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true, intended, and fair scope and spirit<br>
thereof. The foregoing description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to<br>
the precise form disclosed. Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above<br>
teachings. The embodiment(s) was chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the<br>
principles of the invention and its practical application, and to enable one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited<br>
to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of<br>
