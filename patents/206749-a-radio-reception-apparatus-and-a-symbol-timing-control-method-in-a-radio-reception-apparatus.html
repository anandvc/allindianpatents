The present invention relates to a radio reception apparatus, a symbol timing control method and a symbol timing control program, and particularly to a radio reception apparatus, a symbol timing control method and a symbol timing control program, which are used, e.g., in a base station of a mobile communication system achieving fast and large-capacity communication such as data communication.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventional mobile communication systems such as PHS (Personal Handyphone System) employ modulation methods such as a 7i/4-QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) method.<br>
Fig. 13 is a function block diagram illustrating a structure of a radio reception apparatus forming, e.g., a base station of the convention PHS employing such a modulation method.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13, antenna 1 receives an analog receive signal of a radio frequency, and sends it to a frequency converter circuit 2, which converts it to an analog receive signal of an intermediate frequency.    An analog-to-digital converter 3 converts the analog receive signal of the intermediate frequency to a digital receive signal of a predetermined sampling frequency.<br>
The digital receive signal is applied to a quadrature detector 4, and is subjected to quadrature detection or demodulation.   To be exact, the output of quadrature detector 4 is formed of an in-phase component (I-component) and a quadrature component (Q-component).   For the sake of illustration, however. Fig. 13 represents<br><br>
the output by one signal line.<br>
The output of quadrature detector 4 is applied to a sampling frequency converter 5, which intermittently samples the received digital receive signal (thin out the signal) to convert the sampling frequency of the digital receive signal to a lower sampling frequency.<br>
Sampling fi-equency converter 5 applies its digital signal output to a band-limiting filter 6 for band limitation.    Band-limiting filter 6 is a roll-off filter formed of a well known FIR (Finite Impulse Response) fiher or the like.<br>
Band-limiting filter 6 provides its output to a symbol timing detecting circuit 7 as well as a symbol timing extractor 8.   Based on the digital signal output of band-limiting fiher 6 and known reference data, symbol timing detecting circuit 7 detects the timing of presence of a symbol point in the applied digital signal output, and applies a timing signal indicating the detected timing to symbol timing extractor 8.<br>
Based on the timing signal provided from symbol timing detecting circuit 7, symbol timing extractor 8 extracts data of the symbol point fi'om the digital signal output of band-limiting fiher 6.<br>
Symbol timing extractor 8 applies the extracted data of symbol point to a carrier phase and fi-equency offset compensator 9, which compensates for offset in carrier phase and fi-equency.<br>
Carrier phase and fi-equency offset compensator 9 applies its output to a determining portion 10, which determines the symbol point on an I-Q coordinate plane based on the known Ï€/4-QPSK method, and provides a result of this determination as demodulated data.<br>
Fig. 14 is a block diagram specifically illustrating structures of symbol timing detecting circuit 7 and symbol timing extractor 8 illustrated in Fig. 13.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14,1- and Q- components forming the digital signal provided fi-om band-limiting fiher 6 in Fig. 13 are applied to a correlator 7a of symbol timing detecting circuit 7.    Correlator 7a is also supplied with known reference data for each<br><br>
of I- and Q components.<br>
Correlator 7a calculates correlation values between the band-limited I- and Q components and I- and Q-components of the reference data.    An absolute value circuit 7b squares a real part of a number thus calculated, and absolute value circuit 7c squares an imaginary part thereof<br>
An adder 7d obtains a sum of squares of the real part and the imaginary part, and applies the sum to a maximum value detecting portion 7e as a square of the correlation value.<br>
Fig. 15 is a graph illustrating by way of example changes in value of the square of the correlation value obtained by adder 7d.    In Fig. 15, an abscissa gives the time, and the ordinate gives the square of the correlation value.<br>
In the graph illustrated in Fig. 15, maximum value detecting portion 7e detects the timing, at which the square of the correlation value takes the maximum value, as the timing of the symbol point, and issues the timing signal, which indicates the timing of the symbol point, for each of the I- and Q- components to symbol timing extractor 8.<br>
Symbol timing extractor 8 includes switches 8a and 8b for supplying signal components of the I- and Q-components from band-limiting filter 6 to carrier phase and frequency offset compensator 9.<br>
These switches 8a and 8b close when maximum value detecting portion 7e issues the timing signal indicating the timing of symbol point, and thereby obtain the signal of the I- and Q-components, which are sent from band-limiting filt er 6, for providing it as the signal of the symbol point.   Except for the above situations, switches 8a and 8b are open.<br>
In this manner, symbol timing detecting circuit 7 and symbol timing extractor 8 operate to extract the signal of the symbol point from the band-limited digital receive signal, and to provide it to a downstream circuit for demodulation.<br>
The radio reception apparatus illustrated in Fig. 13 employs sampling frequency converter 5 for the following reason.    Usually, the sampling frequency of the digital<br><br>
signal provided from analog-to-digital converter 3 depends on an intermediate frequency, which is output from frequency converter circuit 2, and must be two or more times larger than the intermediate frequency.<br>
For effecting the band limitation on the digital signal of such as high sampling frequency (e.g., of 80 samples per symbol) by band-limiting filter 6, therefore, the FIR filter forming band-limiting filter 6 must perform an increased amount of digital signal processing, and such signal processing takes a very long time.<br>
Therefore, sampling frequency converter 5 is provided for converting the sampling frequency (e.g., of 80 samples per symbol) of the digital signal output of quadrature modulator 4 to a lower sampling frequency (e.g., of 8 samples per symbol).<br>
This reduces the amount of signal processing of band-limiting filter 6 as well as the time required for the signal processing.<br>
The above manner, in which the output signal of quadrature detector 4 is simply sampled (thinning out) by sampling frequency converter 5, suffers from a problem that downstream symbol timing detecting circuit 7 and symbol timing extractor 8 cannot accurately determine the symbol point.<br>
Fig. 15 is a graph schematically illustrating changes in value of the foregoing square of the correlation value, which is obtained by adder 7d of symbol timing detecting circuit 7 as a result of the sampling of the signal by sampling frequency converter 5 in Fig. 13.    In Fig. 15, a curve of broken line represents the value of square of the correlation value, which is considered to correspond to the digital signal of a high sampling frequency provided from quadrature detector 4, and white circles on the curve represent the values of squares of the correlation values corresponding to the symbol points sampled by sampling frequency converter 5, respectively.<br>
In the example illustrated in Fig. 15, sampling frequency converter 5 accidentally sampled the symbol point corresponding to a peak of the digital signal.    Thus, the sampling points indicated by up arrows in Fig. 15 were correctly sampled by accident.<br>
In general, however, sampling frequency converter 5 does not particularly<br><br>
recognize the timing of the sampling to be performed, and performs the sampling in accordance with arbitrary timing.<br>
Fig. 16 is a graph schematically illustrates another example of changes in value of the foregoing square of the correlation value, which is obtained by adder 7d of symbol timing detecting circuit 7 as a result of the sampling of the signal by sampling frequency converter 5 in Fig. 13.    Similarly to Fig. 15, a curve of broken line in Fig. 16 represents the value of square of the correlation value, which is considered to correspond to the digital signal of a high sampling frequency provided from quadrature detector 4, and marks of "X" on the curve represent the values of squares of the correlation values corresponding to the symbol points sampled by sampling frequency converter 5.    In the example illustrated in Fig. 15, sampling frequency converter 5 accidentally and correctly sampled the symbol point corresponding to the peak of the digital signal.    In the example illustrated in Fig. 16, however, sampling frequency converter 5 did not correctly sample the symbol point corresponding to the peak.    Thus, the sampling points indicated by up arrows in Fig. 16 are deviated from the correct sampling timing in Fig. 15.<br>
Since the sampling timing of sampling frequency converter 5 is not particularly controlled, the sampling may be performed in accordance with deviated timing as illustrated in Fig. 16, and the results thus obtained are applied to the downstream symbol timing detecting circuit.<br>
However, a conventional mobile communication system such as PHS generally employs the well known Ï€/4-QPSK method as a modulation method.    Therefore, even if the timing of sampled symbol points is deviated from the correct timing, a reception error or the like does not occur during signal processing.<br>
This will now be described more specifically.    According to the Ï€/4-QPSK modulation method, as is well known, only one symbol point is arranged in each of quadrants on an I-Q coordinate plane.    In this method, since only one symbol point is present in each quadrant, a symbol point is recognized as a correct point as long as the<br><br>
symbol point is in the correct quadrant even if there is a slight deviation in timing of the symbol point.    Therefore, the reception error does not occur in subsequent signal processing.<br>
Recent mobile communication systems such as data communication require higher quality and capacity of transmission than those in conventional voice communication.    Therefore, it has been studied to apply modulation systems of more values than Ï€/4-QPSK method already described.<br>
As an example of such multivalued modulation method, a known 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) method has been practically used in a certain kind of data communication.    According to this 16-QAM method, as is well known, the I-Q coordinate plane includes four signal points, which are arranged in a grid-like fashion, in each quadrant, and thus totally includes 16 signal points, and a symbol point of the receive signal corresponds to any one of the 16 signal points.<br>
In the case where the 16-QAM method is employed as the modulation method of PHS, therefore, if the symbol points are sampled in accordance with improper timing as illustrated in Fig. 16, it is impossible to correctly recognize the correct symbol point, which corresponds to one of the four symbol points in a grid-like fashion in a quadrant of the I-Q coordinate plane, and a symbol point neighboring to the correct symbol point is erroneously recognized instead of the correct symbol point.    Thereby, a reception error occurs in subsequent signal processing.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is provide a radio reception apparatus, a symbol timing control method and a symbol timing control program, which can prevent a reception error due to a deviation of sampling timing of a symbol point even in such a case that a mobile communication system employs a multivalued modulation method for enabling fast and large-capacity transmission.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.    In the following description, the same or corresponding portions bear the same reference numbers, and therefore description thereof is not repeated.<br>
[First Embodiment]<br>
Fig. 1 is a function block diagram illustrating a structure of a radio reception apparatus according to a first embodiment of the invention, which is applied to a base station of a mobile communication system such as PHS.    Each of embodiments, which will be described below, employs well known 16-QAM as a multivalued modulation method.    Therefore, determining portion 10 in a last stage determines symbol points according to the 16-QAM.<br>
The radio reception apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1 is the same as the conventional<br><br>
radio reception apparatus illustrated in Fig. 13 except for the following portions.    A symbol timing detecting circuit 17 basically has the same structure as symbol timing detecting circuit 7 illustrated in Fig. 14, and is configured to apply data of a square of a correlation value, which is provided from adder 7d in Fig. 14, not only to maximum value detecting portion 7e but also to an external portion.   Maximum value detecting portion 7e externally supplies a signal representing timing when the square of the correlation value takes the maximum value.<br>
A symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 18 receives the data of square of the correlation value and the maximum value timing data thus provided from symbol timing detecting circuit 17.    Based on the data of square of the correlation value and the maximum value timing data, symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 18 issues a timing signal, which controls timing of sampling in a sampling frequency converter 15, to sampHng frequency converter 15.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B are waveform diagrams schematically illustrate a principle, on which the symbol timing deviation detecting circuit of Fig. 1 corrects the deviation of timing of the sampling in sampling frequency converter 15.<br>
Figs. 2A and 2B are graphs illustrating, on an enlarged scale, peak portions of graphs shown in Figs. 15 and 16, respectively, representing the squares of the correlation values supplied from symbol timing detecting circuit 17.    In these graphs, white circles represent signal points of squares of the respective correlation values.<br>
Fig. 2 A illustrates a peak portion of the square of correlation value in the case where sampling frequency converter 15 performs the sampling at the correct timing as illustrated in Fig. 15.   In Fig. 2A, a point a2 representing the maximum value is present on a peak of the square of the correlation value, and therefore, points al and a3, which represent squares of the correlation values at the points preceding and following point al, respectively, have substantially the same magnitude.<br>
In contrast to the above, Fig. 2B illustrates a peak portion of the square of the correlation value in the case where sampling frequency converter 15 performs the<br><br>
sampling at the deviated timing as illustrated in Fig, 16.    In Fig. 2B, a point b2 representing the maximum value is not present on a peak of the square of the correlation value, and therefore, points bl and b3 representing squares of the correlation values at the points preceding and following point b2 have different magnitudes, respectively.<br>
In view of the above, magnitudes of differences between the two squares (al and a3, and b1 and b3) preceding and following the maximum value (a2 and b2) of the square of the correlation value as well as directions of changes thereof may be determined so as to determine a magnitude and a direction of the deviation of the maximum value of the correlation value from the position of the peak, and thus to determine a magnitude and a direction of the deviation of the timing of sampling by sampling frequency converter 15 from original or correct timing.<br>
The timing of sampling of sampling frequency converter 15 is corrected corresponding to the detected magnitude and direction of the deviation, whereby the symbol point can be extracted at the correct timing.<br>
In the structure of the radio reception apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1, functions of portions following quadrature detector 4 can be achieved via software by a digital signal processing portion 20 such as a digital Signal Processor (DSP).   In practice, the operations of the radio reception apparatus according to the first embodiment of the invention are executed by software in accordance with flowcharts of Figs. 3, 4 and 6. DSP 20 reads a program provided with steps illustrated in these flowcharts from a memory (not shown), and executes it.    This program can be externally installed.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flowchart representing an operation of detecting the data of square of the magnitude of correlation value in symbol timing detecting circuit 17 in Fig. 1 as well as the timing of the maximum value thereof<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a start position is entered at a correlation value calculation position in a step SI.    In a step S2, it is determined whether the correlation value calculation position is an end position or not.<br>
If it is not the end position, the operation moves to a step S3, and complex<br><br>
multiplication and complex addition are effected on a digital receive signal at the correlation value calculation position and known reference data so that the correlation value and the square of its magnitude are obtained.<br>
In a next step S4, the correlation value calculation position changes to a next position.<br>
Until it is determined in step S2 that the correlation value calculation position is the end position, processing in steps S3 and S4 is repeated.    When it is determined that the correlation value calculation position is the end position, a timing position, at which the square of magnitude of the correlation value takes a maximum value, is determined in a step S5.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of forming sampling timing change data in symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 18 illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
First, the data of the square of magnitude of the correlation value and the data representing the timing position of the maximum value thereof are obtained in a step S11.<br>
Then, an operation is performed in a step S12 to obtain a difference between the magnitudes of squares the correlation values preceding and following the maximum value, and to divide the obtained difference by the maximum value of the magnitude of square of the correlation value.    A result of this division will be handled as a.<br>
In a step S13, it is determined whether a is larger than a predetermined threshold value or not.    If not, |3, which is an accumulation value of a, is set to zero, and a value of counter CNT obtained by counting the number of times of processing is set to zero.<br>
If it is determined in step S13 that a is larger than the threshold value, the currently calculated a is added to P, which is the accumulation value of a, and counter CNT is incremented by one.<br>
In a step SI6, it is determined whether CNT is smaller than the predetermined threshold value or not.    If it is smaller that the predetermined threshold value, the processing ends.    When next data is calculated by the processing in Fig. 3, the data is<br><br>
obtained in step SI 1, and processing from step S12 to step S16 is repeated while incrementing count CNT by one.<br>
When it is determined in a step S16 that CNT reaches the threshold value or more after the processing is repeated a certain number of times, the operation moves to a step SI7.<br>
In step S17, Î², which is the result of accumulation of a obtained by the processing already performed, is multiplied by a predetermined coefficient a, and an absolute value of (a x Î²) thus obtained is handled as an amount of change in sampling timing, and thus an amount of correction for the sampling timing in sampling frequency converter 15.<br>
A sign of P is handled as a direction of the change in sampling timing, and thus a direction of the correction of the sampling timing in sampling frequency converter 15,<br>
Fig. 5 is a flowchart representing, for the purpose of comparison, an operation of a conventional sampling frequency converter 5 in Fig. 13.    In conventional sampling frequency converter 5, an input signal is sampled and output at the timing spaced by ((sampling frequency of input signal)  (sampling frequency of output signal)) from an arbitrary reference timing position in a step S20.<br>
Meanwhile, Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of changing the sampling timing in sampling frequency converter 15 in Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, data of (a x P) calculated by the processing in Fig. 4 is obtained in a step S30.<br>
In a step S31, (a x P) is added to the arbitrary reference timing position. Thereby, the reference timing for starting the sampling in sampling frequency converter 15 can be corrected in connection with the magnitude and direction of the deviation of the sampling timing, which are detected by symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 18.<br>
Consequently, symbol timing extractor 8 extracts the symbol point at the correct timing, and following determining portion 10 correctly determines the symbol point by the 16-QAM method.<br><br>
Fig. 7 is a function block diagram illustrating the radio reception apparatus according to the foregoing embodiment, which is applied to the base station of PHS receiving signals by a plurality of antennas.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, the analog receive signals are applied from four antennas (not shown) via corresponding four fi-equency converter circuits (not shown), and are converted into digital signals by corresponding analog-to-digital converters 3a - 3d, respectively.<br>
Quadrature detectors 4a - 4d receive these digital receive signals, and effect the quadrature detection on them.<br>
Quadrature detectors 4a - 4d provide their outputs to sampling fi-equency converters 15a - 15d, respectively, which intermittently samples the digital receive signals to convert the sampling fi-equencies of the digital receive signals to lower sampling frequencies, respectively.<br>
Digital signal outputs of sampling frequency converters 15a - 15d are applied to band-limiting filters 6a - 6d for band limiting.<br>
Band-limiting filters 6a - 6d provide their outputs to a symbol timing detecting circuit 27, and also provide them to a symbol timing extractor 29.    Symbol timing detecting circuit 27 selects the signal of the maximum receive level from the digital signal outputs of band-limiting filters 6a - 6d, detects the timing, at which a symbol point is present, among the selected digital signal outputs based on the selected digital signal and the known reference data, and applies a timing signal representing the detected timing to symbol timing extractor 29.<br>
Based on the timing signal provided from symbol timing detecting circuit 27, symbol timing extractor 29 selects the signal of the maximum receive level among the digital signal outputs of band-limiting filters 6a - 6d, and extracts the data of the symbol point of the selected digital signal.<br>
Data of the symbol point extracted by symbol timing extractor 29 is applied to a reception directivity control circuit 30, which performs well known adaptive array<br><br>
processing to control the directivity of the receive signal.<br>
Reception directivity control circuit 30 provides its output to determining portion 10, which determines the symbol point on the I-Q coordinate plate based on the well known 16-QAM method, and provides the result as demodulated data.<br>
Symbol timing detecting circuit 27 operates in the same manner as symbol timing detecting circuit 17 illustrated in Fig. 1 except for that the signal of the maximum receive level is selected from the four receive signals.    A symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 28 commonly applies the detected signal for timing correction to four sampling frequency converters 15a - 15d.<br>
As described above, the invention can be applied to the base station (e.g., adaptive array base station) provided with multiple radio reception apparatuses, and can achieve similar effects.<br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
Fig. 8 is a function block diagram illustrating a structure of a radio reception apparatus according to a second embodiment of the invention.<br>
The second embodiment of the invention illustrated in Fig. 8 is an improvement of the radio reception apparatus of the first embodiment.<br>
Thus, the radio reception apparatus according to the first embodiment illustrated in Figs. 1 and 7 uses the output of the band-limiting fdter as it is, and thereby performs the detection of the symbol timing, and thus the detection of the deviation of the symbol timing.    The radio reception apparatus according to the second embodiment described below is an adaptive array radio reception apparatus (e.g., adaptive array base station in the PHS) capable of adaptive array reception with a plurality of antennas, and particularly uses an array composite output, which is calculated from the result of the adaptive array processing of the receive signal, for detecting the symbol timing and the deviation of the symbol timing.<br>
Further, the second embodiment employs a method by quadratic curve approximation, which will be described below, instead of the method of detecting the<br><br>
deviation of the symbol timing in the first embodiment illustrated in Figs. 2A - 4.<br>
Improvements will now be described.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, analog receive signals are applied from four antennas la - Id forming an array antenna through four corresponding frequency converter circuits 2a -2d to corresponding analog-to-digital converters 3a - 3d, respectively, and are converted thereby to digital signals.<br>
These digital receive signals are applied to corresponding quadrature detectors 4a - 4d, which perform the quadrature detection on them, respectively.<br>
Quadrature detectors 4a - 4d apply their outputs to sampling fi-equency converters 3 la - 3 Id, respectively, which intermittently sample the received digital signals to convert the sampling frequency of the digital receive signals to a lower sampling frequency.<br>
The digital signal outputs of sampling frequency converters 31 a - 3 Id are applied to corresponding symbol timing extractors 32a - 3 2d through band-limiting filters (not shown) for band limitation, respectively, and are also applied to a reception directivity forming circuit 34.<br>
Symbol timing extractors 32a - 3 2d each extracts the data of the symbol point of the input digital signal, as will be described later.<br>
The data of the symbol point extracted by symbol timing extractors 32a - 3 2d are applied to a reception directivity control circuit 33, and is subjected to the known adaptive array processing to control the directivity of the receive signal.<br>
According to the adaptive array processing, a reception weight vector formed of reception coefficients (weights) corresponding to the respective antennas are calculated based on the signals sent fi*om terminals and received by the array antenna formed of a plurality of antennas of the base station, and application control is performed according to the vector thus calculated to extract a signal sent fi-om a specific terminal.<br>
In the adaptive array base station employing the adaptive array processing described above, a reception weight vector calculator for calculating such reception<br><br>
weight vector is provided for each of symbols of the receive signal.    The reception weight vector calculator executes processing over a section (weight estimation section) of a known reference signal provided at a leading portion of each frame of the receive signal such that the reception weight vector may converge to reduce a square of a difference between the known reference signal and a sum (array forming output signal) of complex multiplication of the receive signal and the calculated reception weight vector, and thus, the reception weight vector calculator executes the adaptive array processing of converging the reception directivity related to the specific terminal.<br>
According to the adaptive array processing, the convergence of the reception weight vectors is adaptively performed in accordance with the time and variations in transmission path characteristics of signal radio waves so that interference components and noises are removed from the received signals, and the receive signal sent from the specific terminal user is extracted.<br>
The reception weight vector calculator uses adaptive array algorithm such as RLS (Recursive Least Squares) algorithm, LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm or SMI (Sample Matrix Inversion) algorithm, which learns weights by MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) based on the square of the error between the array composite output signal and the reference signal.    Such RLS algorithm, LMS algorithm and SMI algorithm are well knoAvn in the field of the adaptive array processing.<br>
The radio reception apparatus employing the adaptive array processing is disclosed, e.g., in "An Adaptive Array Antenna PHS Base Station", Toshinori linuma et al., Sanyo Technical Review, Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., May 1, 2000, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp. 80 - 88. Therefore, detailed description of the adaptive array processing is not repeated.<br>
Reception directivity control circuit 33 provides its output to determining portion 10, which determines the symbol points on the I-Q coordinate plane based on the known 16-QAM method, and provides a result as demodulated data.<br>
The reception directivity formation information, i.e., the reception weight vector, which is calculated by reception directivity control circuit 33 as described above, is<br><br>
applied to reception directivity forming circuit 34.    Reception directivity forming circuit 34 receives digital signals from sampling frequency converters 3 la - 3 Id.<br>
Reception directivity forming circuit 34 forms an array composite output, which is a complex multiplication sum of the input digital signals provided from sampling frequency converters 3 la - 3 Id and the reception weight vector provided from reception directivity control circuit 33, and provides it to a symbol timing detecting circuit 35.<br>
Symbol timing detecting circuit 35 basically has the same structure as symbol timing detecting circuit 7 illustrated in Fig. 14 (and symbol timing detecting circuit 17 of the first embodiment) except that symbol timing detecting circuit 7 in Fig. 14 obtains the square data of the correlation value between the input, which is the output of the band-limiting filter, and the reference data, but symbol timing detecting circuit 35 calculates the square data of the correlation value between the array composite output and the reference data, and applies it to a symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36,<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a waveform of the square data of the correlation value, which is obtained between the array composite output and the reference data, and is applied from symbol timing detecting circuit 35 to symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36. Referring to this waveform, description will now be given on the method of calculating the symbol timing deviation by symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36 of the second embodiment.<br>
In Fig. 9, a curve of broken line represents the square data of the correlation value corresponding to the digital signal of a high sampling frequency, which is not yet lowered by sampling frequency converters 3 la - 3 Id.    "X" marks on the curve represent the square data of the correlation values corresponding to the symbol points sampled by sampling frequency converters 3 la - 3 Id.<br>
Among the square data indicated by the "X" marks in to Fig. 9, it is assumed that "a" indicates a peak value, and "b" and "c" indicate values immediately preceding and following the peak, respectively.   It is assumed that the sampling points are spaced from each other by "At".<br><br>
By effecting the quadratic curve approximation on these three points, a width of deviation of the symbol point from the original peak point is calculated by the following formula:<br>
-{(c-b)}/(c + b-2a)}x(At/2)<br>
The timing is deviated by the deviation width expressed by this formula from the symbol timing of peak value a in Fig. 9, whereby the correct symbol timing corresponding to the original peak can be obtained.    For eliminating an influence by variations in data, averaging processing is effected on the estimated symbol timing value thus obtained, and thereby the symbol timing is finally determined according to the second embodiment.    This can improve the accuracy of estimation of the symbol timing.<br>
Returning to Fig. 8, symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36 adjusts or controls the timing of sampling of sampling frequency converters 31a - 3 Id based on the correct symbol timing thus calculated.    Symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36 controls the timing of extraction of the symbol points by symbol timing extractors 32a -32d based on the correct symbol timing thus calculated.    Thereby, the symbol points can be extracted at the correct timing.<br>
In the structure of the radio reception apparatus illustrated in Fig. 8, functions of portions following quadrature detectors 4a - 4d can be achieved via software by the digital signal processing portions such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP).    The foregoing operation of the radio reception apparatus according to the second embodiment of the invention is executed by software in accordance with flowcharts of Figs. 10 to 12.    The digital signal processor reads a program having steps in these flowcharts from a memory (not shown), and executes it.    This program can be externally installed.<br>
Symbol timing detecting circuit 35 in Fig. 8 performs the operation of detecting the data of square of the magnitude of the correlation value between the array composite output and the reference data.    This operation is substantially the same as the operation of the first embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3, and therefore description thereof is not<br><br>
repeated.<br>
A flowchart of Fig. 10 corresponds to the flowchart of Fig. 4 illustrating the first embodiment, and represents the operation of forming the data of correct symbol timing.<br>
In a step S41 illustrated in Fig. 10, symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36 obtains, from symbol timing detecting circuit 35, maximum value a of the square data (Fig. 9) of the correlation value calculated by symbol timing detecting circuit 35 as well as values b and c of the square data preceding and following the maximum value position.<br>
In a following step S42, symbol timing deviation detecting circuit 36 calculates the deviation width of the symbol point from the original peak point by effecting the quadratic curve approximation on these three points.<br>
As already described, the deviation expressed by ((c - b) (c + b - 2a) x At - 2) is calculated, and the result of this calculation is subtracted from the timing of peak obtained by the last calculation.    The result thus obtained is handled as an instantaneous peak timing.<br>
In a step S43, calculation is performed to obtain a difference between the peak timing in the last calculation and the instantaneous peak timing.    This difference is multiplied by a coefficient of a (a 
In a next step S44, input values to be applied to symbol timing extractors 32a -32d are calculated from the current peak timing.    More specifically, the current peak timing value is multiplied by the sampling time of the peak timing, and the result thus obtained is divided by the sampling time of the symbol timing.    An integer portion of the result thus obtained is calculated, and is used as the input value.<br>
In a step S45, input values to be applied to sampling frequency converters 31a-3 Id are calculated from the current peak timing and the foregoing input values of the symbol timing extractors.    More specifically, a result of the division of the input value<br><br>
of the symbol timing extractor by the sampling time of the peak timing is obtained, and this results is multiplied by the sampling time of the symbol timing.    The result of this multiplication is subtracted from the current peak timing described above, and the result of this subtraction is multiplied by the sampling time of the peak timing, and is further is divided by the sampling time of the sampling frequency converter.    An integer portion of the result thus obtained is handled as the input value.<br>
A flow diagram of Fig. 11 corresponds to the flow diagram of Fig. 6 illustrating the first embodiment, and illustrates an operation of changing the sampling timing in sampling frequency converters 31a - 3 Id.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, an operation is first performed in a step S50 to obtain the input values to be applied to sampling frequency converters 3la - 3 Id, which are calculated by the sampling timing deviation detecting circuit 36 in step S45 illustrated in Fig. 10.<br>
In a next step S51, sampling frequency converters 3la - 3 Id provide data corresponding to every value obtained by dividing the sampling frequency of the input signal by the sampling frequency of the output signal based on the input values of the sampling frequency converters.<br>
Fig. 12 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of extracting the symbol timing in each of sampling timing extractors 32a - 32d.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, in a step S60 the input values to be applied to symbol timing extractors 32a - 32d are first obtained.    These input values are calculated by the sampling timing deviation detecting circuit 36 in step S44 illustrated in Fig. 10.<br>
In a step S61, symbol timing extractors 32a - 32d provide the data for every value obtained by dividing the sampling frequency of the input signal by a symbol rate (= 1 -^ (symbol time)) based on the input values of the symbol timing extractors.<br>
Through the foregoing processing, symbol timing extractors 32a - 3 2d extract the symbol point at the correct timing, and determining portion 10 in the following stage determines the correct symbol point by the 16-QAM method.<br><br>
In particular, this second embodiment is configured to perform the symbol timing detection based on the array composite output obtained by the adaptive array processing. Thus, according to the adaptive array technology used by reception directivity control circuit 33 in Fig. 8, signals obtained by the plurality of antennas are appropriately weighted, and then are combined so that unnecessary signal components such as noises and interference waves are removed.<br>
As already described, the reception directivity formation information provided from reception directivity control circuit 33 is a reception weight vector used for the weighting.    The symbol timing is detected by using the correlation value between the reference data and the array composite signal, which is prepared by effecting the weighting with the above reception weight vector on the digital signal not yet subjected to the extraction by the symbol timing extractor.    This can improve the accuracy of the symbol timing detection.<br>
The embodiments have been described in connection with the cases where 16-QAM method is employed as the multivalued modulation method.    However, the invention can be applied to the multivalued modulation method other than the 16-QAM method.<br>
Also, the embodiments have been described in connection with the cases where the invention is applied to the base station of PHS, the invention can be naturally applied to a mobile station.<br>
The PHS employs TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) for performing the control in the foregoing embodiments for each of time-divided users.    However, the invention can be applied to methods other than the TDMA method, and can be appUed to a mobile communication system utilizing CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access).<br>
The embodiments have been described in connection with examples, in which the band-limiting filter is formed of the digital filter.    However, the invention can be applied to the case, in which the band-limiting filter is formed of an analog BPF (bandpass filter).<br><br>
The embodiments have been described in connection with cases, in which the plurality of antennas are four in number.   However, the invention can be applied to the cases employing the antennas other than four in number.<br>
In the mobile communication system such as PHS, which employs the multivalued modulation method such as 16-QAM for enabling fast and large-capacity transmission, the invention can correct the deviated sampling timing of the symbol point in the frequency converting means to achieve the correct original timing, and thereby can prevent occurrence of a reception error due to the deviation of the sampling timing.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The radio reception apparatus, symbol timing control method and symbol timing control program according to the invention can correct the deviated sampling timing of the symbol point to achieve the correct original timing even in the case of the low sampling frequency, and therefore are effective particularly in the radio reception apparatus of the mobile communication system employing the multivalued modulation method.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
