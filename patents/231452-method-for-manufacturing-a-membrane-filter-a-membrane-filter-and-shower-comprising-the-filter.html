				<td>Title: Membrane filter with deaeration and method for the manufacture<br>
thereof<br>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a membrane filter.<br>
The invention relates in particular to a method for manufacturing a<br>
membrane filter for water or water-containing fluids. Such filters are used,<br>
for instance, for capturing, from water, particles, traces, bacteria, viruses<br>
and like contaminations, as inter alia for providing Legionella-free water.<br>
Such a membrane filter is known, for instance, from WO 02/076f)89.<br>
In this known membrane filter, a substantially cylindrical housing is<br>
provided, equipped with a water inlet and a water outlet. Between the water<br>
inlet and water outlet, a bottom plate is provided, in which at least firsl<br>
ends of a bundle of water filtering hollow fibers are fixed. These fibers are<br>
hydrophilic. Water that flows through this housing during use can only flow<br>
from the water inlel to the water outlet through the wall of the fibers. As a<br>
result, contamination, for instance in the form of bacteria, is filtered out of<br>
the water.<br>
This known membrane filter has as a disadvantage that air collects in<br>
the housing as a result of the fact that the hydrophilic fibers, once wel, allow<br>
water but no air to pass. As a result, during use, an air bubble is formed in<br>
the housing, which renders the membrane filter largely inoperative. As a<br>
result, such a filter may become inactive for instance for 80% or more.<br>
If. has previously been proposed, in such a membrane filter, to include a<br>
hydrophobic membrane in the bundle of hydrophilic elements, through<br>
which, conversely, air but no water can escape. Such a solution has as an<br>
advantage that the air can escape, but has as a disadvantage that testing<br>
the membrane filter is complicated and time-consuming. For such testing,<br>
firsl the hydrophobic membrane should be tested, with water, to which end<br>
the hydrophobic membrane is to be identified within the bundle.<br>
Subsequently, this hydrophobic membrane should be closed off, at leasl on<br><br>
the side of the bottom plate, after which the filter is filled with water and is<br>
tested for airtightness. Since these hydrophobic membranes cannot be<br>
traced in a mechanized manner, this is a complicated and time-consuming<br>
procedure to be executed manually.<br>
The invention contemplates a method for manufacturing a membrane<br>
filter, in which the above-mentioned disadvantages of the known methods<br>
are at least partly avoided.<br>
The invention more particularly contemplates the provision of such a<br>
method with which membrane filters can be manufactured that have a<br>
doaeration possibility.<br>
The invention further contemplates the provision of such a method with<br>
which membrane filters can be manufactured relatively fast and simply and<br>
preferably in a mechanized manner.<br>
At least a number of these and other objects are realized with a method<br>
according to claim 1.<br>
In a method according to the present invention, a bundle of hydrophilic<br>
filler elements are fixed by at least one first end in a bottom element. This is<br>
commonly denoted as potting.<br>
After potting, an air-permeable watertight element is provided, so that<br>
during use air can escape without the filtering action of the membrane filter<br>
being adversely affected. Preferably, to that end, a hydrophobic filter<br>
element is provided, manufactured and/or cleared.<br>
1 n 1 his description, a hydrophilic filter element should be understood to<br>
mean at least a filter (dement which, at service pressure, allows water but<br>
no air to pass. In this description, hydrophobic filter element should be<br>
understood to mean at least a filter element which, at service pressure,<br>
allows air but no water to pass.<br>
Preferably, a method according to the invention is furthermore<br>
characterized by the features according to claim 6.<br><br>
Alter potting, the connection between the filter elements and the bottom<br>
element is tested for air leakage, while moreover the airtighfness of the<br>
fibers themselves is tested. In this way, defective, leaking fibers can be<br>
identified. This is preferably done under wet conditions, that is, the bottom<br>
part and the filter elements are held under water and subsequently checked<br>
for air bubbles. Only upon proven airtightness is the at least; one; watertight<br>
and air-permeable element, in particular a hydrophobic filter element,<br>
provided.<br>
As in this embodiment of a method according to the present invention, a<br>
watertight and air-permeable filter element such as a hydrophobic filter<br>
element, is not provided for until after testing, the airtightness of the potting<br>
of hydrophilic filter elements can be tested particularly simply and<br>
uniformly. The reason is that, in contrast with the known method, there is<br>
no need first to trace and close off a hydrophobic filter element. As a<br>
consequence, a method according to the invention can be carried out<br>
relatively fast and simply, in an economical manner, and, if desired, be<br>
mechanized simply. Moreover, if the potting is not airtight, at least not<br>
sufficiently so, it is possible to refrain from providing for the or each<br>
hydrophobic filter element.<br>
To a method according to the present invention, advantageously, the or<br>
each watertight and air-permeable element can be provided for by<br>
hydrophobing at least, a portion of at least one hydrophilic filter element. In<br>
this way, the advantage is achieved that in the housing of the membrane<br>
filter. in particular the bottom part, no special provisions need to be<br>
arranged.<br>
Hydrophobing a hydrophilic filter element can be done, for instance, by<br>
applying a hydrophobing agent, in particular a liquid, on the outside of at<br>
least a portion of at least one hydrophilic filter element-, for instance<br>
adjacent, the potting or, conversely, remote therefrom. Alternatively, or in<br>
addition, it is also possible to apply such a hydrophobing agent on the inside<br><br>
of at. least, one hydrophilic filter element. It is then particularly<br>
advantageous if this agent, as a liquid, is applied in the or each respective<br>
hydrophilic filter element from the first ends.<br>
Use of hydrophobing agents such as liquid for obtaining the or each<br>
hydrophobic filter element by hydrophobing at least a portion of at least, one<br>
hydrophilic filter element provides the advantage that the structure, in<br>
particular the pore structure, and hence the transmissivity of the<br>
hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter elements will remain substantially equal,<br>
which is advantageous for the flow characteristic and the resistance of the<br>
membrane filter. Moreover, no extra parts need to be used.<br>
For hydrophobing hydrophilic filter elements, according to the<br>
invention, for instance a substance can be selected from the group of<br>
substances such as PTFE, silicone, Fluorepel™ and the like, while as<br>
hydrophilic filter elements for instance fibers can be used that, are<br>
manufactured from the group of Polysulfone, Polyethersulfone/PVP and t;he<br>
like, which are only mentioned by way of example, As regards usable<br>
hydrophilic filter elements and methods for the manufacture thereof,<br>
reference is further made to the literature, for instance the above-mentioned<br>
international patent applications WO 02/076589 and US2002/0139095,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a method according to the invention is<br>
characterized by the features according to claim 7.<br>
In such a method, in a housing for the membrane filter, at least one<br>
watertight but air-permeable element such as the hydrophobic filter<br>
element mentioned is arranged, preferably after the potting of the<br>
hydrophilic filter elements has been tested and found to be in order. Such a<br>
method can be carried out mechanically in a particularly simple manner<br>
and the position of the or each watertight but air-permeable element is<br>
always uniformly fixed. Moreover, the advantage thus achieved is that the<br><br>
position where air can leave the respective housing can be chosen freely,<br>
also remotely from the position where water will leave the housing.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the watertight and air-<br>
permeable filter element is arranged in the bottom part, in that part in<br>
which the first ends of the hydrophilic filter elements are included.<br>
Preferably, the hydrophilic filter elements are arranged adjacent an<br>
outer circumference of the bottom part, thereby leaving clear a central part<br>
of the bottom part, after which the bundle of hydrophilic filter elements is<br>
wound into a coil shape with a free inner space therein. This inner space is<br>
preferably contiguous to the central part mentioned, after which<br>
hydrophobing of at least a portion of the hydrophilic elements is obtained<br>
from the inner space. Alternatively, in addition to or instead of<br>
hydrophobing at least a portion of the hydrophilic filter elements, the<br>
watertight and air-permeable element such as the hydrophobic filter<br>
element can be arranged in the central part.<br>
By winding the bundle of hydrophilic filter elements in a coil shape,<br>
thereby leaving clear the free inner space, the advantage is achieved that<br>
the inner space renders the hydrophilic filter elements accessible in a<br>
relatively simple manner, as well as the bottom part, while yet a relatively<br>
large filtering surface area is obtained.<br>
In a filter membrane according to the present invention,<br>
advantageously, use can be made of bacteria retaining and/or killing means<br>
and/or further filtering means, such as activated carbon, zeolites, clay<br>
materials, compounds having a controlled release of active substances. pH<br>
controlling agents, ion exchanging substances, minerals, iodide,<br>
disinfectants and the like, which can function as pre-filter and moreover, for<br>
instance, can largely prevent undesired changes in odor and/or taste of the<br>
water or have such filtering action known per se.<br>
The invention further relates to a membrane filter characterized by the<br>
features according to claim 16.<br><br>
Such a membrane filter provides the advantage that air ean simply<br>
escape while the filtering action thereof is preserved.<br>
The invention further relates to a shower, at least shower head and/or<br>
shower hose, provided with a membrane filter according to the invention, at<br>
least a filter membrane manufactured with a method according to the<br>
inversion.<br>
By providing a shower, at least shower head and/or shower hose, with a<br>
membrane filter according to the invention, the advantage is achieved that<br>
contamination such as bacteria, in particular Legionella, is captured<br>
adjacent the position where a user might come into contact with the water.<br>
In this way, a particularly good and simple purification of the water is<br>
obtained, also of water that, for instance, has been stagnant for some time<br>
in piping.<br>
In ihe subclaims, further advantageous embodiments of a method,<br>
membrane filter and shower according to the invention are set forth.<br>

In this description, the same or corresponding parts have the same or<br>
corresponding reference numerals. In this description, hydrophilic filter<br>
element is understood to mean at least a filter element which allows water<br>
to pass but, stops air and bacteria. In this description, hydrophobic filter<br>
element is understood to mean at least, a filter element which allows air to<br>
pass and stops water and bacteria.<br>
Materials for the manufacture of such filter elements are sufficiently<br>
known from practice, such as described, for instance, in the introduction and<br>
in WO02/076589 and US2002/0139095, incorporated herein by reference but<br>
not limited thereto. Suitable in particular, and shown in the drawing, are<br>
microporous hollow fiber membranes, for instance manufactured from PES<br>
or PVDF or the materials described earlier. Such microporous hollow fiber<br>
membranes are described, for instance, in WO 02/076589 and<br>
US2002/0139095 and the publications mentioned therein, as well as<br>
methods for the manufacture thereof, which are understood to be<br>
incorporated herein, at least in that respect.<br>
Fig. 1 shows, in side elevation, a membrane filter 1 according to the<br>
invent ion, provided with a housing 2 having a water inlet 3 and a water<br>
outlet 4. The housing 2 is watertight and airtight, apart from the water inlet.<br>
3 and water outlet 4, and can be included, for instance, in water piping,<br>
shower apparatus, bathing apparatus, spraying apparatus or the like. In<br>
Figs. 2-6, 9 and 10, different embodiments of such a membrane filter 1<br>
according to the invention are shown, in longitudinal cross-section.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment of a membrane filter 1 according to the<br>
invention, with the top removed, in which the housing 2 is substantially<br>
cylinder-shaped and is made up substantially of two parts, viz. a jacket 5 on<br>
which the water inlet 3 is provided and an end piece 6 on which the water<br>
outlet 1 is provided. Provided adjacent the first end 7 of the jacket 5, facing<br>
the end piece (&gt;, is a bottom part 8 watertightly and airtightly closing off the<br>
jacket 5 at the first end 7. In the end piece 6, under the bottom part 8, a<br>
collecting chamber 9 is provided, which is in open communication with the<br>
water outlet 4.<br>
Fixed in the bottom part 8 is a bundle 10 of hydrophilic filter elements<br>
11. The hydrophilic filter elements 11 are hollow, porous fibers as described<br>
earlier, which are included by a first end 12 as well as a second end 13 in<br>
the bottom part 8 and are open towards the collecting chamber 9. Water<br>
that flows during use via the water inlet 3 in the jacket 5 into the<br>
membrane filter 1 can only flow to the collecting chamber 9 by flowing via<br>
the wall 14 of the hydrophilic filter elements 11 info the hollow core 15 of<br>
the fihers and flowing therethrough, via the first end 12 or second end 13<br>
thereof, to the collecting chamber 9 and hence to the water outlet 4. Owing<br>
to t he porous, filtering wall 14, only wafer can flow away via the collecting<br>
chamber 9, whereas, for instance, air and bacteria arc; stopped by the<br>
hydrophilic fibers 11. The bundle 10 of elements 11 has been wound into the<br>
shape of a coil, such that the bundle 10 extends along the inside of the<br>
jacket T&gt;, thereby leaving clear a central part 17 of the bottom part 8 and an<br>
inner space 18 which is substantially cylindrical and is contiguous to t,he<br>
cent ral part 17.<br>
The hydrophilic filter elements 11 are secured by their first and/or<br>
second end 12. 13 in the bottom part 8, for instance by forming the bottom<br>
pari 8 around the ends of the fibers 11, for instance from epoxy. This is<br>
commonly denoted as potting. In view of the function of the membrane filter<br>
 it is of great importance that potting is done in such a way that no air<br><br>
and/or water can flow past the hydrophilic elements 11 and the bottom part<br>
8 from the water inlet to the water outlet 3, 4 without thereby passing the<br>
porous wall 14 of the filter elements 11. In order to be able to check this,<br>
such a membrane filter is tested according to the invention in a manner as<br>
will be described further hereinafter. If this test proceeds successfully, that<br>
is, no leakage of air and/or water is established, then, according to the<br>
invention, at least one air-permeable and water- and bacteria-stopping<br>
second filter element 1.9 is provided, in particular a hydrophobic filter<br>
element 19, schematically indicated in Fig. 2 by a dark-colored fibrous<br>
element. The manners in which this can be realized according to the<br>
invention will be further elucidated hereinafter.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a membrane filter 1 according to the invention which<br>
corresponds in structure and function to that as shown in Fig. 2. In this<br>
embodiment, however, in the bottom part 8, preferably in the central part<br>
17 thereof, a hydrophobic membrane 1.9A is provided for passing air and<br>
stopping water and bacteria and like contamination. This hydrophobic<br>
membrane 19A is preferably arranged, in accordance with a method<br>
according to the invention, after the potting of the bundle 10 of hydrophilic<br>
filler elements .11 has been tested and found to be in order. In a first<br>
embodiment, this can be done by providing the membrane 19A in the bottom<br>
part 8 prior to testing and temporarily closing it off with a plug during<br>
testing. In Fig. 3, to that end, the hydrophobic membrane 19A has been<br>
arranged in a hollow bush 20 which has been secured in an opening in the<br>
bottom part 8 or is integral therewith. A plug 21, schematically indicated in<br>
Fig. 3 by a dotted line, can then be inserted into the hollow bush 20 to close1<br>
off the hydrophobic membrane 19A. After testing of the hydrophilic<br>
membranes 1.1, at least, the potting thereof, the plug 21 can then be removed<br>
to clear the hydrophobic membrane 19A.<br>
in an alternative embodiment;, the bush 20 in Fig. 3 can be replaced,<br>
during the test ing of the potting of the hydrophilic membranes 11, with a<br><br>
plug 21 which, at, least: temporarily, closes off the opening 22 watertight!}-<br>
and airtjghtly. After the potting has been tested and found to bo in order,<br>
the plug 21 is removed and replaced with the bush 20. Optionally, this can<br>
be done via the water outlet 4 but it is preferred that the end piece; G is not<br>
fitted until after the potting has been tested and the hydrophobic membrane<br>
19A has been provided.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically sbows a membrane filter 1 according to the<br>
invention of a relatively small axial length L, whose structure is otherwise<br>
substantially comparable to that of the membrane filters 1 according to<br>
Figs. 1-3. For simplicity, of the bundle 10 of hydrophilic filter elements ] 1,<br>
only the first and second ends 12, 13 are shown. In this embodiment, in a<br>
cover 23, which closes off the second end 24 of the housing 2 situated<br>
opposite the first end 7, an air-permeable and watertight, in particular<br>
hydrophobic membrane 19Ais provided, remote from the bottom pari 8.<br>
This hydrophobic membrane 19A can be fitted in a manner comparable to<br>
the manner as described with reference to Pig. 3, after the potting of the<br>
hydrophilic membranes 11 has been tested.<br>
It is noted that the filtering devices 1 according to Figs. 2 and 3 can also<br>
be closed off at the second end 24 with the aid of a cover 23 (not shown).<br>
Fig. 5 shows two variants of methods according to the invention for<br>
hydrophobing hydrophilic filter elements 11, preferably after their potting<br>
in the bottom part 8 has been tested and found to be in order. It is indicated<br>
by anow P1 that from the top, that is, before the cover 23 is fitted, a<br>
hydrophobing material, in particular a liquid, can be applied with, for<br>
instance a dripper, needle, spray or brush or the like, to the outside; of the<br>
porous wall 14 of a hydrophilic fiber membrane 1 1, as a result of which it<br>
changes into a hydrophobic filter element 19. Thus, a hydrophobic<br>
membrane is obtained through which air can escape to the collecting<br>
chamber 9 and, during use, can leave the membrane filter 1 along with the<br>
water via the water outlet 4. It will be clear that in this way one; or more<br><br>
hydrophilic filter elements can be provided wholly or partly on the outside<br>
thereof with such a liquid for hydrophobic them.<br>
In Fig. 5, it is indicated by the arrow P2 that via the inner space 18 at<br>
least portions of hy drophilic filter elements 11 bounding the inner space 18<br>
can be treated with such a hydrophobing material, in particular liquid, for<br>
instance with the aid of a relatively long needle.<br>
With this method described with reference to Fig. 5, it is also possible,<br>
for instance, to provide annular hydrophobic membrane parts 19 on<br>
different hydrophilic filter elements 19, for instance right above the main<br>
face 16 of the bottom part 8. With the aid of these methods, the ratio<br>
between the total surface area of the hydrophilic filter elements 11 and the<br>
surface area of the or each hydrophobic filter element 19 can be chosen as<br>
desired.<br>
Fig. 6 schematically shows an alternative embodiment of a method<br>
according to the invention, in which the membrane filter 1 is preferably held<br>
up by the first end 7, after which a hydrophobing liquid 25 is introduced via<br>
a first end 12 and/or second end 13 of at least one hydrophilic filter element<br>
11 into the or each respective hydrophilic filter element 11, with the aid of,<br>
for instance, a needle 26, such that a hydrophobic filter membrane is<br>
obtained.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, shown in Fig. 9, the hydrophilic filter<br>
elements 11 are secured in the bottom part 8 only by a first end .12, in a<br>
manner similar to that as shown in Fig. 2, with the opposite second ends 13<br>
being left clear within the jacket 5, which ends 1.3 are closed off by, for<br>
instance, plugs 50 or the like, or are fixed in a cover part 23 and are closed<br>
off, such that water is prevented from flowing via these second ends into or<br>
out of the hydrophilic filter elements 1.1.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a further alternative embodiment, of the cross-flow type.<br>
Here, the first 12 and second ends 13 of the fibers 11 have been potted in a<br>
bottom part 8 and 8A, respectively. The housing 2 is provided at a first end<br><br>
with an inlet 3, in communication with an inlet space 9. On the opposite<br>
side, a .second outlet opening 4B is provided, linking up with an outlet space<br>
9A. The jacket, 5 is provided with a first outlet opening 4A. The fibers 5<br>
connect the inlet, space 9 with the outlet space 9A, such that water can How<br>
through the hollow fibers 11 directly from the inlet 3 to the second outlet<br>
413. In the housing, during use, preferably a reduced pressure is applied, so<br>
t hat a part of the fluid flowing through the fibers 11 is forced through the<br>
wall of r.he fibers 1 1 and can flow out; of the outlet opening 4 A. The water<br>
that. flows directly through the outlet opening 4B can, for instance, be fed<br>
back to the inlet opening 3. Of course, the direction of flow can also be<br>
reversed, or wafer can be introduced through the outlet 4A, to be used as<br>
inlet, and be discharged via the ends 12. 13.<br>
Also in the embodiments shown in Figs. 9 and 10, in manners described<br>
earlier, air-permeable, watertight elements, in particular hydrophobic fibers<br>
or membranes, may be provided.<br>
Materials that are suitable for hydrophobing fibers according to the<br>
invention are sufficiently known from practice and are described, for<br>
instance, in the above-mentioned US2002/0139095 and the publications<br>
mentioned therein, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a fop plan view, and sectional side elevation along Lhe line<br>
A-.A. of a shower head according to the invention, which shower head 30 is<br>
shown in Fig. 8 in exploded view. The shower head 30 comprises a housing<br>
31 provided with a cylindrical head part 32 and a grip 33. The grip is<br>
provided, on the side remote from the head part 32, with a connecting<br>
element 34 and is of hollow design, such that water can flow via a passage<br>
3o from the connection 34 to the head part 32. The head part 32 is closed at<br>
an upper side 36 and open at the opposite lower side 37, which side is closed<br>
by a closure secured thereon, for instance threaded head 38 with water<br>
passage apertures 39. To this extent., the shower 30 corresponds<br>
substantially to standard shower heads.<br><br>
In the head part 32, a membrane filter 1 according to the invention is<br>
included, between the passage 35 in the grip 33 and the head 38. Water can<br>
flow from the connecting part 34 through the passage 35 to the head 38, at<br>
least 1 the holes 39, solely via the membrane filter 1.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the shower head 30 in exploded view. It shows the<br>
substantially cylindrical housing 2 which is open on both sides and, on the<br>
side 39 operatively proximal to the head 38, is provided with an outwardly<br>
extending flange 40. On the flange 40, on the side remote from the head 38,<br>
an ()-ring 41 may be placed which, upon placement of the membrane 1 in<br>
the head part 32, abuts against the free circumferential edge 42 of the open<br>
lower end 37, such that a watertight sealing is obtained.<br>
In Fig. 8, on the left-hand side, the bundle 10 of hydrophilic elements 11<br>
is represented as a cylinder, two rings 43 being shown for sealing and<br>
attachment. The open top of the jacket 2 can be closed off by a cover 23<br>
provided with a central opening 44 through which water can operatively<br>
IIow from the grip 33 into the membrane 1, at least between the fibers 1 1.<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 7, in the membrane 1, inside of the fibers 1 1. a<br>
hydrophobic membrane 1.9 is provided, through which, during use, air can<br>
escape from the shower head 38. Alternatively, in the heart of the cylinder<br>
formed by the bundle 10 of hydrophilic elements 1, a cap 21 may be provided<br>
and, m a manner described earlier, a portion of the hydrophilic fibers may<br>
he hydrophobed.<br>
With a shower, at least shower head 31, according to the invention,<br>
water can be simply filtered directly before it leaves the shower head 38<br>
through the apertures 39, so that recontamination is simply prevented.<br>
After a. particular period of service, or upon reaching a particular extent of<br>
contamination, the filter 1. can be simply replaced, so thai, a desired<br>
throughput is always obtained.<br>
By way of illustration, a number of values for a filler membrane<br>
according to the invention are given, which should not in any way be<br><br>
construed as being limiting. The total membrane length of the fibers is. for<br>
instance!, in the order of magnitude of 40 m, with a membrane surface area<br>
of approximately 0.1 m2. The How rate will vary between, for instance. 8<br>
liters per minute at 1. bar, for a relatively clean filter, and approximately 3<br>
liters per minute at 1 bar in the case of a filter at the end of its service life,<br>
although, of course, many other values are possible. Moreover, in a shower<br>
according to the invention, naturally, also other embodiments of the filters<br>
as shown can be included, for instance according to any one of Figs. 1-4 and<br>
as described in the description.<br>
According to an embodiment of a method according to the invention, a<br>
membrane filter is manufactured by successively potting hydrophilic filter<br>
elements, without functional hydrophobic filter element, subsequently<br>
optionally testing the leak tightness of the potting, preferably in a wet<br>
environment, and subsequently providing for at least one hydrophobic filter<br>
element, in a manner described earlier. Testing can be done, for instance, by<br>
providing water in the chamber 9 and subsequently supplying air from the<br>
opposite side of the bottom part 8. If potting has been done in the proper<br>
manner, no air bubbles will be formed in the water in the chamber 9.<br>
Nat orally, such testing can also be done in other ways, for instance by<br>
applying a known excess pressure in the chamber 9 and/or the inner space<br>
of the housing 2 and checking whether this excess pressure is maintained<br>
independently, for if the potting has not been arranged correctly, the<br>
pressure; will slowly fall as a result of air leaking out. Many comparable<br>
variations will be immediately clear to those skilled in the art. Precisely<br>
because a functional air passage through which no water can escape, in<br>
particular the hydrophobic filter element, is not provided until after this<br>
touting, no further special measures need to be taken during such testing.<br>
A membrane filter .1 according to the invention can be combined with<br>
other filters, for instance pre-filters such as activated carbon. Optionally, a<br>
bacteria-retaining and/or killing means or a pre-filter such as for instance<br><br>
activated carbon can be included in a membrane filter 1, in particular<br>
between the hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic filter elements 11, 19, so that<br>
undosired changes in odor and taste of the water are prevented and reflux of<br>
bacteria and the like via the water inlet is prevented. In the exemplary<br>
embodiments shown, during use, water will flow from the water inlet 3 to<br>
t ho water outlet 4. As a consequence, the water will flow from the outer wall<br>
14 to the inner space 15 of the fibers, which simply prevents the inner space<br>
from getting clogged. It will be clear, however, that the direction of flow can<br>
also be reversed.<br>
It will be clear that in the same or a comparable manner, also other<br>
kinds of hydrophilic filter elements can be used in a membrane filter<br>
according to the; invention, which can first be tested for airtightness, after<br>
which hydrophobic filter elements can be provided, for instance by partly<br>
hydrophobing the hydrophilic filter elements.<br>
The invention is not limited in any way to exemplary embodiments<br>
shown in the description and in the drawing. Many variations thereon are<br>
possible within the scope of the invention outlined by the claims, for<br>
instance; combinations of different parts of the embodiments shown and<br>
