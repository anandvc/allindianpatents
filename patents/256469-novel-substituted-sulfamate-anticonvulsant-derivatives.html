Cross Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S.<br>
Provisional Application 60/378,017, filed on May 13,<br>
2002, which is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel<br>
anticonvulsant derivatives of the general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and X are as herein<br>
defined, and pharmaceutical compositions containing said<br>
derivatives. The compounds of formula (I) are useful in<br>
the treatment of epilepsy.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a<br>
process for the preparation of compounds of formula (XX)<br><br>
wherein X, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as herein defined.<br>
The present invention is further compounds prepared according to any of the processing<br>
described herein.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Epilepsy describes a condition in which a person has<br>
recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process.<br>
Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than a<br>
single disease entity, since there are many forms and<br>
causes of epilepsy. Using a definition of epilepsy as<br>
two or more unprovoked seizures, the incidence of<br>
epilepsy is estimated at approximately 0.3 to 0.5 percent<br>
in different populations throughout the world, with the<br>
prevalence of epilepsy estimated at 5 to 10 people per<br>
1000.<br>
An essential step in the evaluation and management<br>
of a patient with a seizure is to determine the type of<br>
seizure that has occurred. The main characteristic that<br>
distinguishes the different categories of seizures in<br>
whether the seizure activity is partial (synonymous with<br>
focal) or generalized.<br>
Partial seizures are those in which the seizure<br>
activity is restricted to discrete areas of the cerebral<br>
cortex. If consciousness is fully preserved during the<br>
seizure, the clinical manifestations are considered<br>
relatively simple and the seizure is termed a simple<br>
partial seizure. If consciousness is impaired, the<br>
seizure is termed a complex partial seizure. An<br>
important additional subgroup comprises those seizures<br>
that begin as partial seizures and then spread diffusely<br>
throughout the cortex, which are known as partial<br>
seizures with secondary generalization.<br><br>
Generalized seizures involve diffuse regions of the<br>
brain simultaneously in a bilaterally symmetric fashion.<br>
Absence or petitamal seizures are characterized by<br>
sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of<br>
postural control. Atypical absence seizures typically<br>
include a longer duration in the lapse of consciousness,<br>
less abrupt onset and cessation, and more obvious motor<br>
signs that may include focal or lateralizing features.<br>
Generalized Tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures, the main<br>
type of generalized seizures, are characterized by abrupt<br>
onset, without warning. The initial phase of the seizure<br>
is usually tonic contraction of muscles, impaired<br>
respiration, a marked enhancement of sympathetic tone<br>
leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and<br>
pupillary size. After 10-20 s, the tonic phase of the<br>
seizure typically evolves into the clonic phase, produced<br>
by the superitnposition of periods of muscle relaxation on<br>
the tonic muscle contraction. The periods of relaxation<br>
progressively increase until the end of the ictal phase,<br>
which usually lasts no more than 1 min. The postictal<br>
phase is characterized by unresponsiveness, muscular<br>
flaccidity, and excessive salivation that can cause<br>
stridorous breathing and partial airway obstruction.<br>
Atonic seizures are characterized by sudden loss of<br>
postural muscle tone lasting 1-2 s. Consciousness is<br>
briefly impaired, but there is usually no postictal<br>
confusion. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by a<br>
sudden and brief muscle contraction that may involve one<br>
part of the body or the entire body.<br>

conventional techniques such as preparative<br>
chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic<br>
form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by<br>
enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their<br>
component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the<br>
formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with<br>
an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-<br>
tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-1-tartaric acid<br>

of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formacion of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by<br>
chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral<br>
auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved<br>
using a ehiral HPLC column.<br><br>
During any of the processes Cor preparation of the<br>
compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary<br>
and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups<br>
on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved<br>
by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those<br>
described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed.<br>
J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and 7.W. Greene &amp;<br>
P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed<br>
at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from<br>
the art.<br>
One skilled in the. art will further recognize that<br>
wherein a reaction step of the present invention may be<br>
carried out in a variety of suitable solvents, said<br>
reaction step may also be carried out in a mixture of the<br>
suitable solvents.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising one or more compounds of this<br>
invention in association with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in<br>
unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules,<br>
powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or<br>
suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops,<br>
ampoules, autoinjeetor devices or suppositories; for oral<br>
parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal<br>
administration, or for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be<br>
presented in a form suitable tor once-weekly or once<br>
monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of<br>
the active compound, such as the decanoate salt , may be<br>
adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular<br><br>
injection. For preparing solid compositions such as<br>
tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting<br>
ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate,<br>
dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical<br>
diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preforrnulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a<br>
compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these<br>
preforrnulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant<br>
that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout<br>
the composition so that the composition may be readily<br>
subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as<br>
tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation<br>
composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above containing from about 5 to about<br>
2000 mg of the active ingredient of the present<br>
invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition<br>
can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage<br>
form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage<br>
and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the<br>
form of an envelope over the former. The two components<br>
can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to<br>
resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the<br>
inner component to pass intact into" the duodenum or to be<br>
delayed in release. A variety of material can be used<br>
for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids with such materials<br>
as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br><br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions} of<br>
the present invention may be incorporated for<br>
administration orally or by injection include, aqucous<br>
solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil<br>
suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils<br>
such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut<br>
oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical<br>
vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for<br>
aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums<br>
such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, methylcelluloso, polyvinyl -<br>
pyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
The method of treating epilepsy described in the<br>
present invention may also be carried out using a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the compounds<br>
as defined herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may contain<br>
between about 1 mg and about 2000 mg, preferably about 5<br>
mg to about 1000 mg, more preferably about 10 mg to about<br>
500 mg of the compound, and may be constituted into any<br>
form suitable for the mode of administration selected.<br>
Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical<br>
excipients, including, but not limited to, binders,<br>
suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners,<br>
preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable<br>
for oral administration include solid forms, such as<br>
pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including<br>
immediate release, timed release and sustained release<br>
formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms,<br>
such as solutions, syrups, elixers, emulsions, and<br>
suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration<br>
include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions.<br><br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention<br>
may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total<br>
daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two,<br>
three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the<br>
present invention can be administered in intranasal form<br>
via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via<br>
transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a<br>
transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration<br>
will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent<br>
throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of<br>
a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be<br>
combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water<br>
and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary,<br>
suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and<br>
coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture.<br>
Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch,<br>
gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose,<br>
corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as<br>
acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate,<br>
sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include,<br>
without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar,<br>
bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms may include suitably flavored<br>
suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and<br>
natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl -<br>
cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration,<br><br>
sterile suspensions and solutionis are desired. Isotonic<br>
preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous-, administration<br>
is desired.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be<br>
administered in the form of liposome delivery systems,<br>
such as small unilamellar vesicles, largo unilamellar<br>
vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be<br>
formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as<br>
cholesterol, stearylamine or phophatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be<br>
delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as<br>
individual carriers to which the compound molecules are<br>
coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also<br>
be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug<br>
carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyl-<br>
eneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residue.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in<br>
achieving controlled release of a drug, for example,<br>
polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy<br>
butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals,<br>
polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or<br>
amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in<br>
any of the foregoing compositions and according to dosage<br>
regimens established in the art whenever treatment; of<br>
epilepsy is required.<br><br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a<br>
wide range from 5 to 1,000 mg per adult human per day.<br>
For oral administration, the compositions are preferably<br>
provided in the form of tablets containing, 5.0, 10.0,<br>
15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 250 and 500 milligrams of the<br>
active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the<br>
dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount<br>
of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of<br>
from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight par<br>
day. Preferably, the range is from about. 0.1 mg/kg to<br>
about 25 mg/kg of body weight per day, more preferably<br>
from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, more preferably<br>
from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of body weight per<br>
day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1<br>
to 4 times per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily<br>
determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with<br>
the particular compound used, the strength of the<br>
preparation, the mode of administration, and the<br>
advancement of the disease condition. In addition,<br>
factors associated with the particular patient being<br>
treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br>
The following examples describe the invention in<br>
greater detail and are intended to illustrate the<br>

In Vivo Testing, Maximal Electoshock Seizure<br>
Anticonvulsant activity was determined using the<br>
standard MES model for generalized tonic-clonic seizures<br>
(Swinyard EA, Woodhead JH, White HS, franklin MR, In:<br>
Levy RH, Mattson RH, Meldrum BS, Penry JK, Dreifuss FE<br>
eds. Antiepileptic drugs. New York: Raven Press,<br>
1989:85-102).<br>
An electric stimulus of 0.2 sec duration, 60Hz, 50mA<br>
in mice, 150mA in rats, was delivered via corneal<br>
electrodes primed with an electrolyte solution containing<br>
an anesthetic agent (0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride in<br>
0.9% saline).<br>
Mice or rats were randomly selected into control and<br>
test groups. The animals were dosed with vehicle or test<br>
compound, at varylng concentrations. Mice were subjected<br>
to the electrical stimulus at 30 minutes and 4 hours<br>
following administration of test compound. Rats were<br>
subjected to electrical stimulus at time intervals<br>
between 15 minutes and 4 hours following administration<br>
of test compound. Abolition of the hind limb tonic<br><br>
extensor component was an indication of the test<br>
compound's ability to inhibit MES-induced seizure spread.<br>
The EDSO (the calculated dose required to block the<br>
hindlimb tonic-extensor component of the maximal<br>
electroshock seizure in 50% of the animals tested) was<br>
calculated. A probit analysis (Finney DJ. Probit<br>
Analysis. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press,<br>
1971) was used to calculate the ED50.<br>
