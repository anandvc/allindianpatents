				<td>The present invention relates to a connector connecting construction.<br>
The present invention relates to a connector connecting construction arranged in or at a door handle and a handle frame and a clamping member for retaining wires drawn out from a frame-side connector, The present invention further relates to a method of mounting a connector connecting construction.<br>
Various systems for improving convenience in opening and closing automotive doors have been conventionally known. Various electric parts are built in door handles and handle frames in conformity with such systems. For example, in a system disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-82091, a handle-side connector is mounted in a door handle and a frame-side connector is held in a handle frame. An end of the door handle is hinged to the handle frame and the door handle is turned about this hinged end, As the door handle is turned, the two connectors connected with each other are cooperatively and substantially integrally displaced.<br>
Since the frame-side connector is connected with an end of a wire group extending from the interior of a vehicle while being separated from the door handle, there are cases where the frame-side connector is pulled inside by this wire group, cannot easily move toward the door handle and, therefore, cannot flexibly follow the displacement of the handle-side connector when the' door handle is turned. Then, stresses act on the connecting surfaces of both connectors in directions of displacement, which might result in the action of<br>
unnecessary stresses on connected parts of terminal fittings in both<br>
connectors.<br>
The present invention wes developed in view of the above situation, and<br>
an robject thereof is to enable a frame^side connector to be smoothly displaced<br>
when a door handle is turned.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the<br>
independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the<br>
dependent claims,<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector connecting<br>
constructiqn, comprising;<br>
a handle-side connector fixed or to be fixed to a doqr handle piyotally<br>
hinged to a handle frame and displaceable as the door handle is turned or<br>
operated,<br>
a frame-side connector located or to be located (at least partly) in or at<br>
the handle frame so as to be connectable with the handle-side connector, and<br>
disiplaceable together with the handle^side connector in its connected state as<br>
the door handle is turned, and<br>
at least one clamping member including at least one wire retaining<br>
portion for retaining a wire group drawn out through or at or near an end<br>
surface of the frame-side connector and at least one handle attaching portion<br>
substantially continuous with the wire retaining portion and attachable to the<br>
door handle so as to make a relative position of the wire retaining portion to the<br>
door handle substantially invariable.<br>
As the door handle is turned or operated, the handle-side connector is<br>
displaced and the frame-side connector connected with this handle-side<br>
connector is displaced together. At this time, the wire group drawn out through<br>
the end surface of the frame-side connector is substantially retained by the wire<br>
retaining portion of the clamping member, and the handle attaching portion of<br>
this clamping member is attached or mounted to the door handle so as to make<br>
the relative position of the wire retaining portion to the door handle substantially<br>
invariable. Thus, as the door handle is turned or operated, no unnecessary<br>
stress acts on the wire retaining portion from the end surface of the frame-side<br>
connector. As a result, stresses acting on the connecting surfaces of the two<br>
connectors in directions of displacement can be suppressed, thereby<br>
guaranteeing the smooth displacements of the two connector during the turning<br>
movement of the door handle.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an elevating<br>
surface of a door glass is or is to be located at a side of the frame-side<br>
connector substantially opposite to the door handle.<br>
Preferably, the wire group includes an inclined portion to be arranged<br>
oblique to an elevating surface of a door glass in such a manner as to widen a<br>
clearance to the elevating surface of the door glass along a direction away from<br>
the end surface of the frame-side connector, and<br>
the wire retaining portion preferably includes at least one inclined guiding<br>
means for keeping the inclined posture of the inclined portion.<br>
Since the elevating surface of the door glass is located at the side of the<br>
frame-side connector substantially opposite to the door handle, the wire group<br>
drawn out through the end surface of the frame-side connector may interfere<br>
with the door glass. However, the wire retaining portion of the clamping member<br>
includes the inclined guiding means, thereby keeping the inclined posture of the<br>
inclined portion arranged oblique or inclined or at an angle different from 0° or<br>
180° to the elevating surface of the door glass in such a manner as to widen<br>
the clearance to the elevating surface as the wire group extends along the<br>
direction away from the end surface of the frame-'Side connector, Therefore, the<br>
interference of the wire group and the door glass can be avoided.<br>
Further preferably, the end surface of the frame-side connector faces or<br>
is to be arranged so as to substantially face the elevating surface of the door<br>
the wire group is bent after being drawing out through or at or near the<br>
end surface of the frame-side connector, the inclined portion extending from the<br>
bent position, and has an intermediate part thereof bundled at a bundling<br>
position by at least one bundling means, and<br>
out of a plurality of wires forming the wire group, the one to be located at<br>
an inner side of the bend by the bending operation preferably is set shorter<br>
between the end surface of the frame-side connector and the bundling position<br>
than a wire to be located at an outer side of the bend-<br>
With the wire group bent, the wire located at the inner side of the bend is<br>
bent at the bent portion while bulging outward for length adjustment, which<br>
might result in difficulty in being spatially accommodated. However, according<br>
to the above, the wire located at the inner side of the bend is set to have a<br>
shorter length between the end surface of the frame-side connector and the<br>
bundling position than the wire located at the outer side of the bend. Thus, the<br>
bulging-out length at the bent portion of the wire located at the inner side of the<br>
bend can be set shorter, wherefore the wire group can have a compact<br>
configuration at the bent portion.<br>
Most preferably, the clamping member further comprises a connector<br>
attaching portion attachable to the frame-side connector, wherein:<br>
the wire retaining portion preferably is substantially in the form of a strip<br>
extending from the connector attaching portion, and/or<br>
an extending direction of the wire group is defined by turning the wire<br>
retaining portion about the connector attaching portion with the wire group at<br>
least partly arranged along a plate surface of the wire retaining portion.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a clamping member<br>
used in the case where a handle-side connector fixed to a door handle pivotally<br>
hinged to a handle frame is displaced as the door handle is turned, whereby a<br>
frame-side connector connected with the handle^side connector and located in<br>
the handle frame is displaced together with the handle-side connector,<br>
comprising: i<br>
at least one wire retaining portion for retaining a wire group drawn out<br>
through an end surface of the frame-side connector, and<br>
at least one handle attaching portion substantially continuous with the<br>
wire retaining portion and attachable to the door handle so as to make a relative<br>
position of the wire retaining portion to the door handle substantially invariable.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an elevating<br>
surface of a door glass is or is to be located at a side of the frame-side<br>
connector substantially opposite to the door handle.<br>
Preferably, the wire group includes an inclined portion to be arranged<br>
oblique to an elevating surface of a door glass in such a manner as to widen a<br>
clearance to the elevating surface of the door glass along a direction away from<br>
the end surface of the frame-side connector, and<br>
the wire retaining portion preferably includes at least one inclined guiding<br>
means for keeping the inclined posture of the inclined portion.<br>
Further preferably, a connector attaching portion attachable to the frameside<br>
connector is further provided:<br>
the wire retaining portion preferably is substantially in the form of a strip<br>
extending from the connector attaching portion, and/or<br>
an extending direction of the wire group is defined by turning the wire<br>
retaining portion about the connector attaching portion with the wire group at<br>
least partly arranged along a plate surface of the wire retaining portion,<br>
Since the extending direction of the wire group is defined by turning the<br>
wire retaining portion about the connector attaching portion with the wire group<br>
arranged along the plate surface of the wire retaining portion, the wire group<br>
can be easily bent and can be stably kept bent, Further, the wire group is<br>
protected by the wire retaining portion and the connector attaching portion,<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided method of mounting<br>
a connector connecting construction, in particular according to the invention or<br>
a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising the following steps:<br>
fixing a handle-side connector to a door handle pivotally hinged to a<br>
handle frame so as to be displaceable as the door handle is turned,<br>
locating a frames-side connector in or at the handle frame s@ as to be<br>
connectable with the handle^side connector, wherein the frame-^side connector<br>
is displaceable together with the handle-side connector in its connected state<br>
as the door handle is turned,<br>
retaining a wire group drawn out through or at an end surface of the<br>
frame-side connector by means of at least one wire retaining portion of at least<br>
one clamping member, and<br>
attaching at least ope handle attaching portion substantially continuous<br>
with the wire retaining portion to the door handle so as to make a relative<br>
position of the wire retaining portion to the door handle substantially invariable.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the method<br>
further comprises a step of;<br>
arranging an inclined portion of the wire group oblique to an elevating<br>
surface of a door glass in such a manner as to widen a clearance to the<br>
elevating surface of the door glass along a direction away from the encj surface<br>
of the frame*sjde connector,<br>
wherein the wire retaining portion preferably includes at least one<br>
inclined guiding means for keeping the inclined posture of the inclined portion,<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises the steps of;<br>
arranging the end surface of the frameTside connector so as to<br>
substantially face the elevating surface of the door glass ,<br>
bending the wire group after being drawing out through or at the end<br>
surface of the frame*side connector, the inclined portion extending from the<br>
bent position, and bundling an intermediate part thereof at a bundling position<br>
by at least one bundling means, and<br>
out of a plurality of wires forming the wire group, the one to be located at an<br>
inner side of the bend of the bending operation preferably is set shorter<br>
between the end surface of the frame side connector and the bundling position<br>
than a wire to be located at an outer side of the bend These<br>

connected with the sensor and the like is integrally or unitarily supported<br>
adjacent to the fulcrum portion 11 at a position of the handle main body 12 near<br>
the fulcrum portion 11. This har;dle^side connector 30 integrally moves with the<br>
doorhandle 1Q.<br>
The fulcrum portion 11 is at least partly inserted together with the<br>
handle^side connector 30 through a handle insertion opening 16 formed in the<br>
door panel 15 to be located at least partly inside the door panel 15. A handle<br>
frame 20 to be secured to the inner surface of the door panel 15 is prepared<br>
inside the door panel 15, and the fulcrum portion 11 and the handle-side<br>
connector 30 located at least partly inside the door panel 15 are introduced into<br>
the handle frame 20r The fulcrum portion 11 includes a shaft 13, which is<br>
engaged or engageable with a bearing portion (not shown) of the handle frame<br>
20 to permit the door handle 10 to turn or pivot about the shaft 13 relative to the<br>
handle frame 20. More specifically, the handle main body 12 is inclined in an<br>
inclination direction ID (arrow of FIG. 1) about the shaft 13 by pulling the rear<br>
part of the handle main body 12 with respect to the vehicle in a direction away<br>
from the door panel 15.<br>
Further, the frame-side connector 4Q is pivotally arranged in or at the<br>
handle frame 20. The frame-side connector 40 is arranged such that the<br>
connecting surface thereof is substantially faced toward the door handle 10<br>
substantially in conformity with the arranged position of the handle-side<br>
connector 30 when the two connectors 30, 4Q are connected, An elevating<br>
surface 91 of a door glass 90 is arranged in proximity to the handle frame 20 at<br>
the inner side of the handle frame 20, i.e. at a side of the handle frame 20<br>
substantially opposite to the door handle 10, The elevating surface 91 of the<br>
door glass 90 is located at a position substantially behind the connected frameside<br>
connector 40 with respect to a connecting direction GP and/or proximate to<br>
the frame*side connector 40, One or more, preferably a plurality of terminal<br>
fittings (not shown) are at least partly aecemmodated in the fram©*side<br>
connector 40, and the one or more respective terminal fittings are connected<br>
with an end of a wire group 80 (one or more, preferably a plurality of (two in the<br>
shown case) wires 81) fixed or mounted to a door body and extending<br>
substantially from the <door body- the respective terminal fittings are further></door>
connected with one or more electric signal lines inside the vehicle via the wire<br>
group 8Q.<br>
The clamping member 60 is engaged with the wire group 80 drawn out<br>
through the end surface of the frame-side connector 40. The clamping member<br>
60 includes a wire retaining portion 61 integrally or unitarily formed of a<br>
synthetic resin material and adapted to retain the wire group 80, and a handle<br>
attaching portion 62 substantially continuous with this wire retaining portion 61<br>
and attachable to the door handle 10 with the wire group 80 retained by the<br>
wire retaining 61. The clamping member 60 further includes a connector<br>
attaching portion 63 substantially continuous with the wire retaining portion 61<br>
and/or attachable to the frame-side connector 4Q;<br>
As shown in FIG, 5, the wire retaining portion 6,1 preferably is<br>
substantially band- or strip^shaped, and one (upper surface shown in FIG. 5) of<br>
the substantially opposite plate surfaces thereof serves as a placing surface<br>
61A for the wire group 80, At a position of the wire retaining portion 61 near one<br>
end (position near the connector attaching portion 63) is provided a hinge<br>
portion 64, which preferably is thinner than areas of *he wire retaining portion<br>
61 before and/or after the hinge portion 64, If the wire retaining portion 61 is<br>
turned about the connector attaching portion 63 in a turning direction TD (arrow<br>
shown in FIG. 2) from a state where the wire group 80 is placed on the placing<br>
surface 61 A, the hinge portion 64 is resiliently deformed substantially into an<br>
arcuate shape and the wire group 80 is forcibly bent near the end surface of the<br>
frame-side Qgnneptar 40,<br>
The, wire retaining portion 6.1 preferably extends in one direction from a<br>
connected part thereof to the connector attaching portion 63 before being bent,<br>
and is provided at a rear portion (preferably substantially at a rear half) thereof<br>
with respect to an extending direction with a base plate portion 65 including the<br>
hinge portion 64 and/or to i^e arranged substantiilly in parallel with the<br>
elevating surface 91 of the door glass 9Q, and at a front portion (preferably<br>
substantially at a front half) thereof with respect to the extending direction with<br>
an inclined guiding portion 66 sloped upward toward the leading end. The<br>
inclined guiding portion 66 is substantially continuous with tlr? base plate<br>
portion 65 preferably via a step or bent portion so as to be slightly higher than<br>
the base plate portion 65, and/or the width thereof in transverse direction<br>
preferably is narrower than that of the base plate portion 65,. The wire group 80<br>
retained by the wire retaining portion 61 is caused to extend in such a direction<br>
as to gradually widen a clearance to the elevating surface 91 of the door glass<br>
91 by the inclined guiding portion 66, Here, an inclined portion 8QA of a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention is formed. In other words, after<br>
extending toward the elevating surface 91 of the door glass 90 from the end<br>
surface of the frame-side connector 40, the wire group 80 becomes an inclined<br>
portion 80A via a bent portion 806. The inclined portion 80A can be held<br>
inclined in a substantially constant posture by being supported by the inclined<br>
guiding portion 66.<br>
As shown JD PISS. S and 4, the connector attaching portion 6,3 includes<br>
one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) draw-out guiding<br>

retaining portion 61 with respect to the extending direction, and one or more<br>
connector attaching main bodies 68 preferably joined on the outer surfaces of<br>
the draw-out guiding plates 67. As shown in FIG, §, the draw-out guiding<br>
plate(s) 67 preferably has/have a substantially quarter circular shape in side<br>
view by each having an arcuate edge 67A substantially corresponding to the<br>
shape of the bent hinge portion 64 of the wire retaining portion 61, and the<br>
arcuate edge 67A is arranged substantially along the corresponding side edge<br>
of the bent hinge portion 64 of the wire retaining portion 61. The draw^out<br>
guiding plates 67 preferably rastrist tee. movements of the wire group 80<br>
along width direction by baing located at the lateral side(s) (preferably at the<br>
substantially opposite outer sides) of the wire group 80 retained by the wire<br>
retaining partion 61,<br>
The connector attaching main bodies 68 preferably have a larger<br>
thickness than th© draw-out guiding plates 67 and include one or more parts<br>
projecting more backward than the rear ends of the draw-out guiding plates 67<br>
with respect to the extending direction, and one or more, preferably a pair of<br>
lateral (left and/or right) mounting grooves 69 extending substantially along the<br>
rear end(s) of the draw-out guiding plate(s) 67 and making one or more<br>
openings in the upper end surface(s) and/or the facing surfaee(s) of the<br>
connector attaching main body/bodies 68 are formed in these backward<br>
projecting part(s). The mounting grooves 69 preferably are in the form of rail<br>
grooves substantially transversely symmetrical with respective to the axial line<br>
of the wire retaining portion $1. 0ne or more mounting ribs 41 substantially<br>
corresponding to the mounting grooves 69 are provided on an end portion of<br>
the frame-side connector 40, By at least partly fitting the end portion of the<br>
frame^side connector 40 substantially between .the facing surfaces of the<br>
connector attaching main bodies 68, the mounting ribs 41 are slid or inserted<br>
into the mounting grooves 69 'through the openings made in the upper end<br>
surfaces of the connector attaching main bodies 68 by the mounting grooves<br>
69. In this way, the clamping member 60 is detaehably attached to the frameside<br>
connector 40.<br>
The handle attaching portion 62 includes one or more, preferably a pair<br>
of lateral (left and/or right) reinforcing plates 71 (preferably substantially<br>
opposed to each other) and standing up or projecting from or near the<br>
(preferably substantially opposite) side edge(s) of an intermediate part<br>
(preferably a substantially middle part) of the wire retaining portion 61 with<br>
respect to the extending direction, i,e. a part between the base plate portion 65<br>
and the inclined guiding portion 66, and one or mm® handle attaching main<br>
bodies 72 extending upward substantially in parallel with the outer surface(s) of<br>
the reinforeing plate(s) 71 after projecting sideways from the outer surfaee(s) of<br>
the reinforeing plate(s) 71. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or<br>
right) facing walls 75 preferably extending substantially up to the same position<br>
as the extending ends of the handle attaching main bodies 72 and/or<br>
substantially facing the corresponding handle attaching main bodies 72 while<br>
defining one or more slits 74 are provided on or at the reinforcing plates 71.<br>
The facing walls 75 preferably are located more toward the central axial line of<br>
the wire retaining portion 61 than the connector attaching main bodies 68.<br>
Each handle attaching main body 72 is gate=shaped in side view by<br>
being comprised of one or more, preferably a pair qf front and/or rear pieces<br>
72A and a beam 72EI, and has an engaging hole 73 inside. One or more<br>
engaging projections 14 substantially corresponding to the engaging holes 73<br>
are provided on or at the fulcrum portion 11 of the door handle 1Q, The handle<br>
attaching portions 62 are brought closer to the door handle 10 to at least partly<br>
insert one or more frame plates 11A of the fulcrum portion 11 into the slits 74,<br>
whereby the frame plates 11A preferably are held between the handle attaching<br>
main bodies 72 and the substantially facing walls 75. When the handle<br>
attaching portions 62 are pushed toward the door handle 10, the handle<br>
attaching main bodies 72 resilisntly move over the engaging projections 14 to at<br>
least partly fit the engaging prpjectipns 14 into the engaging holes 73, with the<br>
result that the handle attaching portions 62 are attached to the door handle 10.<br>
In this attached state, the end surfaces of the frame plates 11A rest on the<br>
bottom surfaces of the slits 74, thereby preventing the handle attaching portions<br>
62 from being pushed any further.<br>
Next, an assembling procedure, functions and effects gf this<br>
embodiment are described,<br>
First, the bandle.sjde ccpnegtQC 3Q is sugpQrtid, o.n the gjp.pj handle, 1p,<br>
the handler-side connector 3Q and the fulcrum pgrtian 11 are at least partly<br>
introduced into the handle frame 20 through the handle insertion opening 16 of<br>
the door handle 10 in this state, and the door handle 10 is hinged to the handle<br>
frame 20 via the shaft 13. The frame-side connector 40 connected with the end<br>
of the wire group 80 is pivotally located inside the handle frame 20, and the<br>
clamping member 60 is attached to the frame*side connector 40 laterally (from<br>
the right side in FIG. 2) by sliding the mounting ribs 41 substantially along the<br>
mounting grooves 69. The wire group 80 is bundled with the inclined guiding<br>
portion 66 by a bundling portion 85 (corresponding to preferred bundling<br>
means) preferably by taping or clamping or strips-bundling at an intermediate<br>
part thereof. Then, as shown in FIG. 2, the handle-side connector 30 and the<br>
frame-side connector 40 are connected to bring the sDnneeting surtaxes o,f both<br>
into contact. When the two connectors 30, 40 are properly connected, the one<br>
qr more terminal fittings at least partly accommodated inside them are securely<br>
connected,<br>
In the connected state of the two connectors 30, 40, the wire group 80<br>
drawn out through the end surface of the frame-side connector 40 preferably<br>
extends substantially straight along the wire retaining portion 61 without being<br>
bent at its intermediate position as shown in FIG. 2. At this time, out of the wire<br>
group 80, the wire 81A located at an inner side of the bend in the bent state<br>
preferably extends substantially straight so as to be at a shortest distance from<br>
the end surface Qf the frame-side connector 40 to a bundling position by the<br>
bundling portion 85, whereas the wire 81B located at an outer side of the bend<br>
extends obliquely inward from the end surface of the frame^side connector 40<br>
to the bundling position. In other words, the wires 81A located at the inner side<br>
of the bend preferably is shorter between the end surface of the framerside<br>
connector 40 and the bundling position than the wire 81B located at the outer<br>
sjde.,<br>
After the, two Qonoectgrs gq, 4Q ace Qgnoeotad. with each Ptftex thi<br>
clamping member 60 (wire retaining portion 61) is turned in the turning direction<br>
TD (a direction of arrow in FIG. 2), At this time, since the clamping member 60<br>
and the wire group 80 are united by the bundling portion 85 via the inclined<br>
guiding portion 66, the clamping member 60 may be turned by holding the wire<br>
group 80, Then, the hinge portion 64 is bent about the connector attaching<br>
portipn 63 to extend substantially along the arcuate edges 67A of the drawraut<br>
guiding plates 67, whereby the handle attaching portion 62 gradually<br>
approaches the fulcrum portion 11 of the door handle 10. While the clamping<br>
member 60 is being turned, the wire group 80 comes substantially into contact<br>
with the placing surface 61A of the wire retaining portion 61 to be at least partly<br>
placed thereon, and the bent portion SOB is formed as the hinge pprtion 64 is<br>
bent. The inclined posture of the inclined portion 8QA is defined by the inclined<br>
guiding portion 66, and the respective wires 81 are at least partly supported one<br>
above the other on the placing surface 61A of the wire retaining portion 61. The<br>
wire group 80 preferably is not in contact with the placing surface 61A of the<br>
wire retaining portion 61 between the hinge portion 64 and the inclined guiding<br>
portion 66 by the presence of the step or bent portion of the inclined guiding<br>
portion 66.<br>
When the handle attaching portion 6? is turned up to an attaqhed<br>
position to the door handle 10, the handle attaching main bodies 72 are<br>
resiliency engaged with the engaging projections 14 as shown in FIG. 1,<br>
whereby the clamping member 60 and the door handle 10 are united or<br>
integral. In this attached state, the inclined portion 80A of the wire group 80 is<br>
supported to substantially extend in such a direction as to widen the clearance<br>
to the elevating surface 91 of the door glass 90 toward the leading end by the<br>
inclined guiding portion 66. The bent portion SOB of th© wire 81A located at the<br>
inner side of the bend largely bulges out substantially in U-shape as if covering<br>
the wire 81B located at the outer side of the bend due to the presence of the<br>
inclined portion 80A, but has a compact configuration.<br>
After the clamping member 60 is attached to the door handle 10 in this<br>
way, the door handle 10 is turned or pivoted in the inclination direction ID<br>
(direction of arrow of FIG. 1) about the shaft 13. Then, the handle-side<br>
connector 30 is displaced in the rotating direction ID of the door handle 10 and<br>
the frame-side connector 40 connected with this handle-side connector 30 is<br>
likewise displaced in the rotating direction ID of the door handle 10, following<br>
the displacement of the handle-side connector 30. At this time, the wire group<br>
80 drawn out through the end surface of the frame-side connector 40 is<br>
retained by the wire retaining portion 61 of the clamping member 60, and the<br>
handle attaching portion 62 of the clamping member 60 is attached and fixed to<br>
the door handle 10 with the wire group 80 kept retained by the wire retaining<br>
portion @1, Thus, even if the door handle 10 is turned, th© relative position of<br>
the wire retaining portion 61 to the door handle 10 is fixed. Accordingly, no<br>
unnecessary stress acts on the part of the wire group 80 retained by the wire<br>
retaining portion 61 from the end surface of the frame-side connector 40 as the<br>
door handle 10 is turned. As a result, stresses acting on the connecting<br>
surfaces (connecting areas) of the two connectors 30, 40 in directions of<br>
displacement are suppressed and the two connectors 30, 40 are smoothly<br>
displaced during the turning movement of the door handle 10.<br>
Since the elevating surface 91 of the deer glass 90 is located at the side<br>
5<br>
of the frame-side connector 40 opposite to the door handle 10, the wire group<br>
80 drawn out through the end surface of the frame-side connector 40 may<br>
interfere with the door glass 90. However, according to this embodiment, the<br>
wire group 80 preferably has the inclined portion 80A arranged oblique to the<br>
elevating surface 91 of the door glass 90 to widen th© clearance to this<br>
elevating surface 91 along a direction away from the end surface of the frameside<br>
connector 40, and/or the inclined posture of this inclined portion 80A is<br>
stably supported from below by the inclined guiding portion 66 of the clamping<br>
member 60. Therefore, the interference of the wire group 80 and the door glass<br>
90 can be avoided.<br>
Further, the wire 81A to be located at the inner side of the bend by the<br>
bending operation is bent at the bent portion 80S while bulging outward for<br>
length adjustment because of the presence of the inclined portion 80A, which<br>
might result in an excessive bending stress and difficulty in being spatially<br>
18<br>
accommodated. However, according to this embodiment, the wire 81A located<br>
at the inner side of the bend preferably is set to have a shorter length between<br>
the end surface of the frame-side connector 40 and the bundling position than<br>
the wire 81B located at the outer side of the bend. Thus, the bulging^Qut length<br>
at the bent portion 8QB of the wire 81A located at the inner side of the bend ©an<br>
be set shorter, wherefore the action of an unneoessarJiy large bending stress at<br>
this position can be prevented and the wire group 80 can have a eompast<br>
configuration.<br>
Furthermore, since the extending direction of the wire group 80 can be<br>
defined by turning the wire retaining portion 61 about the connector attaching<br>
portion 63 with the wire group 80 arranged substantially along the placing<br>
surface 61A of the wire retaining portion 61, the wire group 80 can be easily<br>
bent and stably kept bent. Further, the draw^-out end of the wire group 80 can<br>
be protected by being at least partly covered by the wire retaining portion 61<br>
and the connector attaching portion 63.<br>
Accordingly, to enable a frame-side connector to be smoothly displaced,<br>
a door handle device S is provided with a handle^side connector 30 to be fixed<br>
to a door handle 10 to be pivotally hinged to a handle frame 20 and<br>
displaceable as the door handle 10 is turned, a frame^side connector 40<br>
located at or at least partly in the handle frame 20, conneetable with the handleside<br>
connector 30 and displaceable together with the handle-side connector 30<br>
in its connected state as the door handle 10 is turned or operated, and at least<br>
one clamping member 60 including at least one wire retaining portion 61 for<br>
retaining a wire group 80 drawn out through or at an end surface of the frameside<br>
connector 40 and a handle attaching portion 62 substantially continuous<br>
with the wire retaining portion 61 and attachable to the door handle 10 so as to<br>
make a relative position of the wire retaining portion 61 to the door handle 10<br>
ep,p.n.d I<br>
Next, a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is<br>
described with reference to FIGS. 6 to 9. The second embodiment partly differs<br>
from the first embodiment in the shape of a clamping member 60A, but is<br>
substantially similar to the first embodiment in qthej points. Thus, similar o,r the<br>
same part? as the first embodiment §re identified by the same reference<br>
numerals and are ngt repeatedly described,<br>
A wire retaining portion 01 B is comprised only of a base plate portion 64<br>
having no inclined guiding portion 66 and/or extending substantially straight in<br>
one direction from a connected position with a connector attaching portion 63A<br>
before being bent as shown in FIG. 9. Unlike the first embodiment, there is no<br>
technical idea of supporting the wire group 80 in an inclined posture in the<br>
second embodiment, wherefore there is no likelihood that the bent portion SOB<br>
bulges outward and cannot be easily accommodated. A part of the wire<br>
retaining portion 61 B located before the connected part with the handle<br>
attaching portion 62 is shorter than in the first embodiment, and one or more<br>
ribs 77 extending substantially in width direction for guiding a finger placing<br>
movement are formed on the bottom surface of the wire retaining portion 61 B<br>
opposite to a placing surface 61 A for the wire group 80 while being spaced<br>
apart in forward and backward directions. Preferably, there is nothing<br>
equivalent to the bundling portion 85 in the vicinity of the clamping member<br>
2.0<br>
60A, and the handle attaching portion 62 has the same shape as in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
One or more draw-out guiding plates 67A of the connector attaching<br>
portions 63A are shorter in forward and bacKward directions than in the first<br>
embodiment because the bent portion SOB of the wire group 80 does not bulge<br>
outward, and one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) drop<br>
preventing portions 78 project substantially inward at or near the extending<br>
ends of the drawout guiding plates 67A. The drop preventing portions 78<br>
preferably are substantially in the form of ribs narrow and long along the<br>
extending direction of the draw*out guiding plates 67A, and preferably are<br>
transversely symmetrically arranged (preferably at the substantially same height<br>
position) on the innec surfaces (substantially faQing surfaces) of the dr-iw^ogt<br>
guiding plates 67A. As shown in FIG, 8, one or more eutouts 648 are made at<br>
the (preferably substantially opposite) side edge(s) of a hinge portion 64A by<br>
removing molds for the drop preventing portions 78.<br>
Here, when the hinge portion 64A is bent as the clamping member 60A<br>
is turned, the drop preventing portions 78 are brought substantially into contact<br>
in width direction with the placing surface 61A of the wire retaining portion 61 B,<br>
more specifically an end position of the bending operation by the hinge portion<br>
64A (position near or immediately before the hinge portion 64A). Thus,<br>
although the hinge portion 64A preferably has a lower rigidity by being thinned,<br>
the hinge portion 64A can be stably held in its bent posture by being supported<br>
by the drop preventing portion 78.<br>
Embodimeots&gt;<br>
The present jnypntjgn i§ 0$ lirnitgd tg tb§ etee desQrJbe,c! and<br>
illustrated embodiments. For example, the following embodiments are also<br>
embraced by the technical scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
claims. Beside the following embodiments, various changes-can be made<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined<br>
by the ejaims,<br>
(1) Although the clamping member is attachable tp the frame«side<br>
GQFineGtoT by having the connector attaehing portion in the foregoing<br>
embodiments, it may not be engaged with the frame-side eo-nnector without<br>
having the connector attaching portion according to the present invention. For<br>
example, the elamping member may be comprised of a wire re|aining portion<br>
for retaining the wire group drawn out through the end surface of {he frame-side<br>
connector at a position distant from this end surface and a handle attaching<br>
portion continuous with this wire retaining portion. In short, it is sufficient for the<br>
elamping member to have an invariable relative position to the door handle by<br>
having the handle attaching portion,<br>
(2) Although the bundling portion by taping or the like is provided in<br>
addition to the clamping member in the first embodiment, the wire retaining<br>
portion may double as the bundling portion according to the present invention.<br>
This can reduce the number of parts.<br>
(3) Although the wire group extends via the bent portion while<br>
substantially facing the elevating surface of the door glass in the foregoing<br>
embodiments, it may extend without via the bent portion while facing the<br>
elevating surface of the door glass. In this case, the facing directions of the<br>
connecting surfaces of the two connectors may be set substantially parallel to<br>
the elevating surface of the door glass and/or their connecting direction may be<br>
substantially normal to the elevating surface of the door glass,<br>
(4) In the foregoing embodiments, the sleep handle is provided with<br>
the engaging projections and the clamping member is pr-ovided with th© handle<br>
attaching main bodies in the form of projecting pieces. Conversely, according to<br>
the present invention, the door handle may be provided with members in the<br>
form of projecting pieces equivalent to the handle attaching main bodies and<br>
th@ clamping member may be provided with engaging projections,<br>
(5) In the foregoing embodiments, the mounting grooves are formed<br>
in the connector attaching portion and the mounting r-ibs are provided ©n the<br>
frame-side connector. Conversely, according to the present invention, the<br>
connector attaching portion may be provided with mounting ribs and the frameside<br>
connector may be provided with mounting grooves.<br>
(6) Although the handle frame is a member separate from the door<br>
panel in the foregoing embodiments, it may be constructed as the same<br>
member as the door panel according to the present invention.<br>
