				<td>This invention relates to the process for the preparation of ion imprinted polymer particles for pre concentrative separation of palladium(II) ions via solid phase extraction . Palladium ion imprinted polymer particles were prepared by bulk polymerization of palladium-amino, hydroxy or mercaptoquinoline-4-vinyl pyridine ternary complex with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as functional and crosslinking monomers in the presence of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. The synthesis was carried out using 2-methoxyethanol as porogen. The polymer particles thus synthesized enables the preconcentrative separation of palladium from platinum and other transition metals (which coexist with palladium in its minerals/ores) either individually or in mixtures. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
Ion imprinted polymers<br>
Reference may be made to John et al, W099 15, 707; 1999 relating to the detection and extraction of uranyl ions by polymer imprinting wherein the complexable functionality is of the formula CTCOOH, when T is a hydrogen or any halogen (preferably chlorine), methyl and halogen substituted forms thereof or CCOOH or PhCOOH. Another reference may be made to Gladis and Rao, Indian Patent, 2003 IPA 516 DEL 03 dt. 28.3.03, who have synthesized ion imprinted polymers for solid phase extractive preconcentration/separation of uranyl ions from host of tetravalent, tervalent and bivalent inorganic ions from both aqueous and synthetic seawater solutions. This patent relates to the synthesis of uranyl ion imprinted polymer particles by thermal polymerization of uranium-Quinoline-8-ol or its dihalo derivatives-4-vinyl pyridine ternary complex with monomers such as styrene and divinyl benzene in presence of AIBN as initiator. Yet another reference may be made to Dai et al US patent 6, 251, 280; 2001 who prepared mesoporous sorbent materials by ion imprinting technique for the separation of<br>
reference may be made to Dai et al US patent 6, 251, 280; 2001 who prepared mesoporous sorbent materials by ion imprinting technique for the separation of inorganics using bifunctional ligands such as amines, thiols, carboxylic acids, sulphonic acids and phosphonic acids.<br>
Still another reference may be made to Singh et al, US Patent 6, 248, 842; 2001 who produced selective crosslinked chelating polymers by substituting an acyl chelating agent with a polymerizable functional group. The resulting substituted acyl chelating agent was complexed with the target metal ion, i.e. copper and crosslinked with a suitable monomer. The complexed metal is then removed providing a crosslinked polymeric chelating agent that has been templated for copper ion. However, there are no patents related to the preparation of ion imprinted polymer particles for preconcentrative separation of palladium(II) from platinum(IV) and other transition metals. Catalysts<br>
The potential for induced chirality at transtiion metal catalysts within molecular imprinted polymer binding sites has been elegantly explored by Gagne et al [Organometallics, 17 (1998) 3138-3140; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122 (2000) 6217-6225] in some very detailed and vigorous investigations employng metals as diverse as rhodium, titanium and platinum. Lemaire et al [Tetrahedron Lett. 135 (1995) 8779-8782; J. Mol. Cat. A. Chem. 135 (1998) 89-98] have demonstrated the increase of enantioselectivity of hydride transfer reaction by using molecular imprinted polymer based rhodium complexes as catalysts. To overcome the site heterogenity problem, Gagne and coworkers [Organometallics, 21 (2002) 7-9] adopted a poisoning stragegy using diamine derivatives of binaphthol to block the most easily accessible sites in a MIP containing chiral phosphine platinum complexes. Further, the immobilized catalysts produced via molecular imprinting methodology can be made more selective through chemical modification with suitable "poisons", a result which may trigger post-imprinting derivatisation of imprinted polymer binding sites [Krisch et al. Polymer, 41 (2000) 5583-5590];<br>
Polboron and Severin [J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. (1999) 2481-2482; Chem. Eur. J. 6 (2000) 4604-4611] have synthesized immobilized ruthenium catalysts based on molecular imprinting for the reduction of benzophenone.<br>
Cammidge et al [Chem. Commun. 2001, 2588-2589] have synthesized heterogenous palladium catalyst assemblies by molecular imprinting using methacrylic acid, EGDMA or styrene-divinyl benzene monomers in presence of bis PdCl2-(4-ethenyl phenyl) diphenyl phosphine)-l,2-dihydroxy benzene complex. These authors have demonstrated the clear superiority of catalysts prepared by molecular imprinting over traditional polymeric ligands. Solid phase extraction<br>
Rao et al [Trends in Anal. Chem. 2004] have reviewed the preparation of tailored materials for preconcentration/separation of metals by ion imprinted polymers for solid phase extraction [IIP-SPE). IIP materials with nanopores were prepared by formation of ternary complex of palladium imprint ion with dimethyl glyoxime and 4-vinyl pyridine and thermally polymerizing with styrene and divinyl benzene in presence of 2,2'-azobis isobutyronitrile using cyclohexanol as porogen [Sobhi et al. Anal. Chim. Acta, 488 (2003) 173-182]. 2-Hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (HEMA) polymers<br>
Joshi et al [Chem. Engg. Sci. 53 (1998) 2271-2284] have prepared MIP's for the removal of traces of phenol from anisole using different functional monomers including 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate. From equilibrium sorption studies on various MIP's, it was observed that HEMA based MIP showed slightly higher sorption capacity than methacrylic acid based system. In continuation of the above work on removal of trace impurities from bulk chemicals, same authors [Chem. Engg. Sic. 55 (2000) 1509-1522] report on the separation of phenol, bisphenol-A and 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone isomers (2,4-DHB) using HEMA by employing surface as well as bulk imprinted polymerization approaches. Sreenivasan has utilized y-irradiation to synthesize molecular imprinted poly-HEMA  containing  memory  sites  while  developing   sensor  components   for<br>
testosterone [Polymer Gels and Networks, 5 (1997) 17-22] and salicylic acid [Talanta, 44 (1997) 1137-40]. Inspite of several advantages of imprinted polymers based on HEMA, as functional monomer there are no reports so far for the preconcentrative separation of noble metals including palladium.

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention offers methods for synthesizing palladium(II) selective ion imprinted polymer particles having accessible and homogenous imprinted sites for solid phase extraction from dilute aqueous solutions.<br>
As used herein, the term "ion imprinting polymer (IIP) refers to a material that has been polymerized around an imprint ion in such a way that when imprint ion is removed from the material, cavities or "Imprinted sites" remain in the material that are complementary in shape and size of the imprint ion. On the addition of IIP particles to dilute solution containing imprint ion, the imprint sites selectively binds imprint ion. Such binding allows the use of tailored IIP particles for enrichment/separation of imprint ions from other such ions which are similar to it. The salient features of the invention include the following, i)   making the polymer materials<br>
ii) pretreatment of the polymer materials to leach the imprint ion iii) Preconcentrative separation of Palladium(II) from platinum(IV) and other transition metal ions<br>
There are three main steps in the synthesis of tailored palladium(II) IIP particles: (I) formation of binary complex of imprint ion (palladium) with AQ or Q or MQ, (ii) formation of ternary complex in presence of 4-vinyl pyridine and (iii) polymerization of ternary mixed ligand complex with HEMA and EGDMA. The<br>
formation of ternary complex was carried out by mixing binary Pd(II)-AQ or Pd(II)-Q or Pd(II)-MQ precipitates with 4-vinyl pyridine in 2-methoxyethanol (Porogen). Evidence for formation of binary and ternary complexes with palladium were monitored by recording UV-visible absorption spectra. Figs.l,2&amp;3 show the absorption spectra of AQ or Q or MQ, VP, Pd(II)-AQ orPd(II)-Q or MQ, Pd(II)-VP and Pd(II)-AQ-VP or Pd(II)-Q-VP or Pd(II)-MQ-VP. These spectra clearly shows the formation of binary and ternary complexes (See Fig.4) in 2-methoxyethanol solution.<br>
The ternary complexes viz. Pd(II)-AQ-VP or Pd(II)-Q-VP or Pd(II)-MQ-VP were imprinted on addition of HEMA (functional monomer) and EGDMA (crosslinking monomer) in presence of AIBN. The resulting IIP materials were dried in an oven at 60° to obtain palladium IIP materials. Fig.5 shows the schematic representation of polymer imprinting process. These materials were ground and sieved to obtain palladium(II) IIP particles. i)   Pretreatment of the IIP particles to leach the imprint ion<br>
The imprint ion, i.e. palladium(II) ion was removed from the IIP particles by stirring with 100 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl for 18 h. The resulting IIP particles were dried in an oven at 60°C to obtain palladium(II) IIP-SPE particles which can be used for selective enrichment of palladium ions from dilute aqueous solutions. Fig.6 shows the percent enrichment of palladium(II) ions by using AQ, Q or MQ based HP's. The retention capacities of AQ, Q or MQ based HP's are shown in Fig.7. ii) Preconcentrative separation of palladium(II) from platinum(IV) and other<br>
transition metal ions<br>
The preconcentrative separation of palladium(II) from platinum(IV), copper(II), zinc(II) and nickel(II) when present individually and in admixtures was studied by using AQ, Q and MQ based palladium(II) IIP particles. The results show quantitative separation from copper(II), palladium(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) (which are likely to coexist with palladium in its mineral or ore deposits). Further,<br>
selectivity coefficients (Spd(II)/pt(iv)) were found to be 550, 4.25 and 8.19 for AQ, Q<br>
and MQ based palladium IIP particles.<br>

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of palladium(II) selective extraction agent prepared by polymer<br>
imprinting with 8-aminoquinoline and 4-vinylpyridine.<br>
The polymer preparation was carried out in 2 steps: (i) the binary complex of palladium with 8-aminoquinoline was prepared by precipitating palladium(II) ions with 8-aminoquinoline from pH 2.5 solutions after the addition of monochloroacetic acid buffer. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried in an oven at 60'C, (ii) for polymerization, 0.01, 0.10 and 0.30 g of Pd(II)-AQ precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 2-methoxyethanol and mixed with 40 ^il vinyl pyridine (VP), 0.02, 0.20 and 0.6 ml of 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 0.13, 1.30, 3.90 ml of ethylene glycoldimethacrylate (EGDMA) and 50 mg of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN). The above polymerization mixture was cooled to 0°C; purged with N2 for 15 min, sealed and<br>
heated in an oil bath at around ~80°C with constant stirring for 15 min. The solid formed was washed with water and dried in an oven at 60°C. This resulted in 0.511, 2.58 and 6.05 g of polymer materials respectively. The palladium(II) embedded in the polymer was leached with 100 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl for 18 h. This resulted in 0.447, 1.81 and 4.55 g of ion imprinted polymer particles after drying in an oven at 60°C. Example 2<br>
Synthesis of palladium(II) selective extraction agent prepared by polymer imprinting with 8-liydroxyquinoline(Q)<br>
The polymer preparation was carried out in 2 steps: (I) The binary complex of Pd(II)-Q was prepared by precipitating palladium ions with 8-hydroxyquinoline from pH 2.5 solutions after the addition of monochloroacetic acid buffer. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried in an oven at 60°C, (ii) For polymerization, 0.10 g of Pd(II)-Q precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 2-methoxyethanol and mixed with 40 µl of VP, 0.20 ml of HEMA and 1.30 ml of EGDMA and 50 mg of AIBN. The above polymerization mixture was cooled to 0°C, purged with N2 for 15 min, sealed and heated in an oil bath at around ~80°C with constant stirring for 15 min. The solid formed was washed with water and dried in an oven at 600C. This resulted in 1.78 g of polymer material. The palladium(II) embedded in the polymer was leached with 100 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl for 18 h. This resulted in 0.85 g of palladium ion imprinted polymer particles after drying in an oven at 60°C.

The polymer preparation was carried out in 2 steps: (I) The binary complex of Pd(II)-MQ was prepared by precipitating palladium ions with 8-mercaptoquinoline from pH 2.5 solutions after the addition of monochloroacetic acid buffer. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried in an oven at 60°C,<br>
 (ii) For polymerization, 0.10 g of Pd(II)-MQ precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 2-methoxyethanol and mixed with 40 µl of VP, 0.20 ml of HEMA and 1.30 ml of EGDMA and 50 mg of AIBN. The above polymerization mixture was cooled to 0°C, purged with N2 for 15 min, sealed and heated in an oil bath at around ~80°C with constant stirring for 15 min. The solid formed was washed with water and dried in an oven at 60°C. This resulted in 1.90 g of polymer material. The palladium(II) embedded in the polymer was leached with 100 ml of 50% (v/v) HCl for 18 h. This resulted in 1.76 g of palladium ion imprinted polymer particles after drying in an oven at 60°C.<br>
Thus, palladium(II) ion imprinted polymer particles were synthesized containing palladium(II) ion memory recognition sites. The above synthesis was carried out in 2 steps (i) isolating the binary complexes of palladium with amino, hydroxy or mercaptoquinoline and (ii) polymerization of resultant binary complexes with 4-vinyl pyridine and 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as functional and crosslinking monomers respectively in the presence of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator. The leaching of above polymer materials was carried out by stirring with 50% (v/v) HCl for 18 h. The resultant palladium(II) IIP particles offer quantitative separation of palladium(II) from copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) and improved selectivity coefficients for palladium(II) over platinum(IV). Advantages :<br>
The palladium(II) IIP particles prepared in the present invention utilizes simple and readily available chelating ligands like 8-amino, 8-hydroxy or 8-mercapto quinolines. These IIP particles after leaching has the unique capability of picking palladium (II) from very dilute solutions thereby palladium (II) can be recovered from low grade minerals, ores etc. Furthermore, these palladium (II) IIP particles has the additional capability of separating palladium (II) from platinum (IV) and transition elements which are likely to coexist with palladium in nature thus enabling preconcentrative separation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
