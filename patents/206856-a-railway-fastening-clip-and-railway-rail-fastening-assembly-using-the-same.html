				<td>Introduction to the field of Invention<br>
This invention, in one aspect, relates to improvements in or relating to railway rail fastening clip. This invention, in another aspect, relates to railway rait fastening assembly.<br>
In the third aspect, this Invention relates to a novel shoulder attachment component for the purpose herein described.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Railway rail fastening dips of various designs are well known and are used on a wide scale in the permanent way all over of the world.<br>
Various such clips are described in commercial literatures and Patent literatures, for example, Indian Patents 67601, 125118, 148053 and 155586 describe in detail one such type of railway fastening clips. Herein referred to as CAT-1 type. SimilariyJ for example, Indian Patents, 147179 and 158984 describe a modified type of railway fastening clips herein referred to CAT-2 type.<br>
In general, in the CAT-1 type of the above referred Indian Patents, a rail fastening clip comprises a rod of resilient metal which has been bent, so as to have, progressing from one end of the rod to the other end, a first portion, which starts at said one end of the rod and is a straight or nearly straight leg, then a second portion, then a third portion, then a fourth portion and finally a fifth portion which ends at said other end of the rod, these portions being such that when the clip is in particular position, the lower most points on the opposite ends of the first portion are in the same plane as one another and the lowermost points on the third and fifth portions are in the same horizontal plane as one another, and the second portion proceeding from the first portion has a rising part followed by a failing part and when the clip is viewed from above, the third and fifth portions appear to be an opposite sides of the axis of the first portion,<br>
In all the above cases, the highest point on the upper side of the second portion is higher than the highest point on the upper side of the fourth portion. And the third portion bearing on the flange of the rail and the fifth portion bearing on a fixed surface in an anchoring member (generally, referred to as insert/shoulder).<br>
2<br><br>
Similarly, in the modified CAT-2 type, the railway fastening clip is aiso comprised of the five portions for the clip formed in the manner described but the highest point on the upper side of second portion is lower than the highest point on the upper side of the fourth portion. And the fifth portion bearing on the flange of the rail and the third portion bearing on the fixed surface on the anchoring member.<br>
Drawbacks of Prior Art:<br>
Clips of CAT -1 type are generally manufactured from resilient mental rods up to 22.2 mm diameter and those of CAT-2 type are generally manufactured from 20.5 mm diameter rods or less for economy vis-a-vis CAT -1 type clips. Experimental tests conducted in our laboratory showed up that<br>
1.	Toe-load, the primary requirement of design of a clip, is lesser in case of CAT-1 type clips than<br>
toe load of CAT-2 type clips, although the diameter of resilient metal rod of CAT-1 type clips is<br>
more.<br>
2.	CAT-2 type clips are when stressed by driving into an assembly of rail and other constituent<br>
components as per design, on the removal show permanent set at the toe, and this behaviour is<br>
not shown in CAT-1 type clips.    This shows that CAT-2 type clips have tendency of over-<br>
stressing.<br>
When the above experimental observations are reckoned to aim at still higher magnitude of toe-load, one can think only to increase the diameter of the parent resilient rod to make the clip stiffer against deflection, which otherwise means increase in weight of the clip and ultimately more of the input of raw material and more the cost of the clip.<br>
The applicant is also aware of the following Prior art patents viz. GB 944688, GB 421418 and GB 764404.<br>
The applicant has studied the details and include the following comments so as to establish that none of the prior art patents have any relevance to the applicant's invention.<br>
3<br><br>
1)   GB 944688	vis-a-vis	41/CAL/2000<br>
dt. 18.12.1963	dt. 27.01.2000<br>
(a)	In the British patent 944688 dt. 18.12.63, the rail is held to the cone. Sleeper by means of a<br>
clip which has at least three limbs; of which one limb rests on top of rail flange.  The clip is<br>
said to be same as of the patent No. 861473 referred to in the description of 944688.<br>
Therefore, 944688 does not have any relevance to the applicant's invention as for as clip is<br>
concerned.<br>
(b)	Moreover, though the   clip in the British patent is   formed from resilient bar , one of the<br>
portions in the instant invention has a plurality of segments constituting a wave with a view to<br>
stiffen the portion whereas clip of the British patent has a mere bend.  This is a salient point<br>
of difference in the constructional features of the two clips.<br>
(c)	The other embodiment of invention of the British patent is the rail and fastening arrangement.<br>
In this arrangement the rail is pressed downwardly by one of the three limbs  of the clip on<br>
top of rail flange similar to in any other known system by use of rail clips for holding rail to<br>
sleepers. Whereas in the applicant's   invention , which .broadly relates to the anchoring<br>
arrangement for the clip in the assembly, .the anchoring means for the clip  is a shoulder or<br>
also called the insert embedded in concrete sleeper, is of known art and design which is<br>
commonly in use and has not been included as part of claims made in the specification.<br>
Therefore, the anchoring mechanism of the British patent does knot require technical analysis<br>
for relevance to anchoring device of the applicant's invention.<br>
(d)	Further, in the British patent, one of the limb of clip as stated earlier, directly lies on the rail<br>
flange, and there is no gap between the rail flange edge and face of the anchoring device,<br>
Therefore, no attachment is essential.    Since waved clip of the applicant's invention is<br>
designed for use on concrete sleeper in use, an attachment becomes necessary to fill the<br>
gap available between edge of rail flange and shoulder.<br>
Because of these important reasons at least while there are many other reasons, obviously British patent 944688 is not relevant to applicant's invention.<br>
4-<br><br>
2)	GB 421418	vis-a vis	41/CAU2000<br>
dt. 20.12.1934	dt 27.01.2000<br>
(a)	According to specification the above British patent, there are provided different embodiments<br>
to suit different conditions and requirements; each dip with a lip to overlap and secure the edge of rail flange.<br>
(b)	The clips are generally of two categories; namely (i) screwed type (ii) Non-screwed self-<br>
tightening type. The clip of of the applicant's invention is not of screwed type. Therefore, the<br>
two dips are different in design philosophy., constructional and functional aspects.<br>
(c)	The dip of the British patent is secured to the base plate or chair by a T- headed square<br>
necked bolt passing through a hole in the clip. The bolt is anchored beneath a slot in the<br>
chair. While the clip of the applicant's invention does not require any hole in it. It is anchored<br>
to a shoulder embedded in concrete and has a hole disposed longitudinally parallel to rail<br>
length,<br><br>
(e)	The lip of the clip in the British patent is undercut to form shoulder which may be oblique or<br>
parallel to length of rail edge as per requirement. Between the shoulder and the rail flange, is<br>
a gap in which a flat wedge shaped steel key is inserted for gripping action between the clip<br>
and rail. The system is primarily meant to arrest rail creep, it is rigid with no elastic features<br>
to dampen rail vibrations and so are likely to lead to loosening and falling from the assembly<br>
under vibrations;<br>
(f)	fn the applicant's construction, the clip being elastic is capable of absorbing rail vibrations<br>
and does not just fail off under traffic.<br>
Obviously the British patent has no relevance to the applicant's invention.   -<br><br>
3)	GB  764404	Vis -a -Vis	41/CAL/2Q00<br>
dt. 22.01.1958	dt. 27.01.2000<br>
a.	The British patent specification relates to fastening device 'Resilient Rail spike with<br>
Resilient Clip* comprising: a spike with two legs, a bridge piece , two helical windings<br>
and a clip which is T- shaped and has cross members  supported within the helical<br>
coils and has a member) meant to rest under the bridge piece.<br>
b.	The rail spike acts as anchoring device for the clip (T) which holds the rail foot. The<br>
system is used by spiking the tegs into pre-made holes in the sleepers; the<br>
functioning of the system depending upon the quality of grips between the legs of<br>
spike and holes in sleepers. The clip acts as a unit within the spike.<br>
c.	The above features are different from the anchoring device and the clip of the<br>
applicant's invention where there are no members like vertical legs, bridge, holes kin<br>
sleepers etc,<br>
d.	The anchoring device of the applicant's invention is rigid and fixed and the said<br>
waved clip being self-tightening unlike the said resilient spike and the clip the British<br>
patent.<br>
e.	Obviously the constructional details with respect to anchoring as well as of resilient<br>
clips, of the British patent and functioning are on vastly different concepts &amp;<br>
philosophies for Therefore, the above British patent does not have any relevance to<br>
applicant's invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved rail fastening clip, which will not only obviate the above drawbacks but also provide additional advantages.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide such an improved clip, which can be manufactured easily to exact specifications at lower investment than possible so far.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to propose such a clip, which will require less amount of metaf but which will provide better function.<br><br>
It is yet another object of the Invention to provide such an improved rail fastening clip which will exhibit higher toe load, higher creep resistance and lesser damage to the rubber pad, therefore increasing the life of the rubber pad in the track.<br>
It is a further more object of the Invention to provide such an improved rail fastening clip, which alone or with the assembly will require less maintenance cost and track supervision.<br>
It is yet another object to provide such a rail fastening clip, which can be used with the existing shoulder with or without additional attachment.<br>
It is yet another more object to provide such a rail fastening clip, which in the assembly of the permanent way, enable tolerance of heavy axle loads at higher speeds.<br>
These and other objects of the Invention will be more clear from the following paragraphs: -<br>
Thus according to this Invention, there is provided a railway rail fastening clip-made of a rod of esilient metal bent to have multiple portions from one end to the other end which in progression comprises the following portions: -<br>
i.	a first portion starting from the said one end of the rod being a straight or nearly<br>
straight portion disposed more or less in a horizontal plane forming the central leg of the clip,<br>
ii. a second portion rising from the said first portion forming a reverse bent disposed in space,<br>
iii. a third portion extending from the said reverse bent, forming the heel of the clip, which is at the same level or at a level slightly lower than the said reverse bent,<br>
iv. a fourth portion being a second space curve extending from the said heel and disposed above the said first portion, namely the central leg,<br>
v. a fifth portion forming the toe of the clip, extending from the said second space curve, namely the fourth portion, and disposed on the opposite side of the axis of the said first portion, namely the central leg and finally,<br>
7-<br><br>
(vi)       a sixth portion extending from the said fifth portion forming the other end of the rod and facing more or less towards the said reverse bent,<br>
(vii)      wherein the said second space curve, namely the fourth portion, consists of a plurality of segments constituting wavy formation along the curved length of the said space curve.<br>
In one embodiment, the bottom most point of the said heel lies in the plane carrying the said toe and the top most point of the central leg.<br>
in another embodiment, the bottom most point of the said heel lies in the plane slightly above the plane carrying the said toe and the top most point of the central leg.<br>
It is to be remembered that, the said heel and the said toe are interchangeable in their position.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment, the segments on the second reverse curved surface are contiguous with one another and all the segments are preferably of the same dimensions and cross-sections.<br>
The railway rail fastening cip is adopted for fastening the rail on concrete sleepers already laid in track or on new concrete sleepers of conventional design awaiting laying.<br>
There is also provided an improved shoulder attachment for use with the novel railway rail fastening clip comprising in progression the following features;<br>
(a)	a first portion forming a resting portion for the heel of the dip and adopted to be sealed<br>
on the fixed surface of a conventional anchoring member,<br>
(b)	a second portion in the form of a reverse curve extending from the above mentioned heel<br>
resting portion,<br>
(c)	a third portion extending from the said reverse curve portion forming a resting portion for<br>
the toe of the dip and<br>
(d)	a stem portion formed at the under surface of the said toe resting position adopted to be<br>
positioned between the rail flange edge and inside phase of the conventional insert or<br>
anchoring member while in use.<br>
8<br><br>
In the shoulder attachment, the said reverse curve portion is adopted to be disposed above the central leg of the railway rail fastening clip while in use.<br>
The shoulder attachment is adopted to be interlocked with the said conventional shoulder while ii use.<br>
Brief description of the drawings:<br>
We describe a preferred embodiment of the rail fastening clip in the accompanying drawings where<br>
Figure 1" illustrates a top view of the improved clip.<br>
Figure 2 shows the view in the direction of arrow x of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 shows the view in the direction Y of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 4 illustrates in plan view a novel attachment/ component used with the clip of the invention.<br>
Figure 4a shows the view in the direction Z in figure 4 and<br>
Figure 5 briefly illustrates an assembly showing a rail flange fastened to a sleeper.<br>
9<br><br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
It witl be dearly seen from Figures 1 to 3 and more clearly from Figure 2 that the rail fastening clip of the Invention also has the usual five portions but with a few changes. It will be seen that the fourth portion of the clip is shown as having wavy configuration. These wavy pattern can be two or more as per requirements and convenience.<br>
The other portions viz. the first, second, third and fifth portions are substantially the same as in the usual clips but for as few modifications.<br>
This rail clip has the following features:<br>
a.	The central leg (1) starting from end E1 of the rod and is substantially straight up to certain<br>
length and is disposed more or less in the horizontal plane.<br>
b.	Rising from the straight leg (1) a reverse bent (2) disposed in space and on the driving end of,<br>
the shoulder fixed to the sleeper.<br>
c.	Extending from the reverse bend (2) the heel (3), which is at the same level or at lower level<br>
than part (2).<br>
d.	Another space curve (4) extending from heel (3) and disposed above the central teg (1) to<br>
avoid infringement with any segment of the shoulder in the assembly while driving the clip.<br>
The space curve (4) consisting of segments 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d etc. constituting wavy formation with the space curve (4) (a special feature of this Invention).<br>
e.	Extension from space curve (4), the toe (5) ending at E2 on the opposite side of the axis of<br>
the central leg (1). The end E2 more or less facing towards the reverse bend (2).<br>
f.	The bottom most point of heel,(3) may or may not lie in the plane carrying toe (5) and top<br>
most point of central leg (1).<br>
The portions (3) and (5) of the clip may interchange their positions without change in segments 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d etc. of the space curve connecting portions (3) and (5).<br>
10<br><br>
Referring now to Figures 4 and 4A of the drawings, it will be seen that a novel shoulder attachment is proposed to ensure better advantages. This attachment is provided for use with the waved spring dip on concrete sleepers already laid in track or new sleepers of same design awaiting laying- By in situ use of this attachment on above concrete sleepers, the waved spring clip can be used with advantage.<br>
The shoulder attachment of Figure 4 and 4A consists of a heel resting portion (6) for seating on the fixed surface of the anchoring member (generally known as insert/shoulder), a toe resting portion (7), stem {8) at the under surface of portion (7) which is positioned between the rait flange edge and inside face of the insert in the assembly. The portions (6) and (7) are joined by the reverse curve portion (9) near the ends (10) of the said attachment which has recess (11) in the near middle to match the length and width of the insert. Portion (9) of the attachment is disposed above the central leg of the clip and the shoulder attachment is interlocked with the shoulder in the assembly.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that the new clip can be used with the new shoulder for best advantages. However, the new clip can also be used with the old shoulder with the shoulder attachment, tt is not outside the scope of the Invention to use the new clip with existing shoulder with some modifications as may be warranted.<br>
We now refer to Figure 5, which illustrates a rail assembly. The manner in which the above shoulder attachment is used in the existing concrete sleeper is shown in part assembly in Figure 5, The assembly consisting of rail (12) pad (13) shoulder attachment (14) and the waved spring Clip (15) anchored into the shoulder (16) which is pre-cast in the concrete sleeper (17).<br>
The shoulder attachment (14) can be of steel, cast iron or insulating material e.g. Gen-66 material. The pad (13) may be rubber or any other suitable material.<br>
When we take of new shoulder, it should be understood as follows; -<br>
The new shoulder is principally of similar construction and configuration but for the difference that the heal seat is raised with reference to the old one.<br>
