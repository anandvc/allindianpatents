				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] <br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a horn mounting structure in a two-wheeled motor vehicle.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
The horn of a two-wheeled motor vehicle is required to generate a horn sound forward, so usually it is mounted<br>
inside a front cover of a vehicle body, or when there is not such a horn mounting space inside the front cover, the horn is mounted in the front portion of the body frame at a position behind a head pipe, (Japanese Utility Model Laid Open No. 117287/82).<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, in the case where the horn is mounted in the front portion of a body frame, the horn mounting position is restricted because the space for pipes of the body frame is ensured inevitably, and if the front face of the horn cannot face forward of the vehicle body, it is required to increase the sound volume of the horn.<br>
Where the horn is covered with a cover or the like, the above increase of the horn sound volume becomes more necessary.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a horn mounting structure in a two-wheeled motor vehicle capable of effectively utilizing the interior space of a vehicle body frame which space has not been utilized heretofore, thereby improving the degree of freedom of the horn mounting space, and also capable of reducing the sound volume of a horn to a minimum required volume .<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the horn mounting structure in a two-wheeled motor vehicle defined in claim 1 of the present invention includes a body frame, the body frame being provided with a tunnel portion which is open downward and being formed integrally with a head pipe which supports front forks rotatably, with a horn being disposed inside the tunnel portion so as to face forward.<br>
Thus, behind the head pipe and inside the tunnel portion of the body frame which opens downward, the horn is disposed so as to face forward, so that the interior space of the body frame which has so far been a dead space can be utilized effectively, and the degree of freedom in mounting the horn is enhanced.  Besides, since the horn faces forward and the body frame which opens downward also serves as a trumpet-shaped loudening portion, it is possible to reduce the sound volume of the horn to a minimum required sound. £0005]<br>
According to the horn mounting structure in a two-wheeled motor vehicle defined in claim 2 of the present invention, in combination with the horn mounting structure<br>
of claim 1, a reinforcing member is attached to the body frame so as to span the tunnel portion, and the horn is supported by the said reinforcing member.<br>
Such a horn supporting member in the tunnel portion of the body frame can reinforce the body frame which opens downward, and hence it is also possible to ensure a sufficient rigidity of the body frame.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a horn mounting structure in a two-wheeled motor vehicle, including a body frame (F) , said body frame being provided with a tunnel Q3HE) portion which is open downward and being formed integrally with a head "££!" pipe which supports front ^££ forks rotatably, with a horn being disposed within said tunnel portion so as to face forward.<br>

As shown in Figs . 1 and 2 , a scooter type two-wheeled motor vehicle V is provided with a body frame F formed integrally using an aluminum alloy. A head pipe 1 is formed integrally with the front portion of the body frame F, and front forks 2 are supported by the head pipe 1 so that they can turn right and left .  At the lower ends of the front forks 2 is supported a front wheel Wf through an axle shaft, while to the upper ends of the front fork 2 is connected a bar handle 4 which is covered with a handle cover 3.  A power unit P provided with an engine 5 and a transmission 6, as well as a rear wheel Wr driven by them, is supported by the rear, lower portion of the body frame F so as to be swingable vertically through a power unit hanger link 7 .  The rear end of the power unit P and that of the body frame F are connected together through a rear cushion 8.  To the rear end of ..the- body frame F are fixed both ends of a sub-frame 9 which is a pipe formed in a generally U shape in plan, and a fuel tank 20 is supported by the sub-frame 9.<br>
[0009]<br>
A body cover B of the two-wheeled motor vehicle V comprises a leg shield front upper 11 which covers the upper front portion of the head pipe 1, a leg shield front lower 12 connected to the lower portion of the leg shield front upper 11, a leg shield rear 13 which covers the rear side of both leg shield fronts 11 and 12, left and right floor panels 14L, 14R connected to the lower portion of the body frame F, an under cover 15 which covers the undersides of both front panels 14L and 14R, and left and right rear covers 16L, 16R which cover the rear portion of the body frame F.  The body frame F is exposed to the portion surrounded with the leg shield rear 13, left and right floor panels 14L, 14R and the left and rear covers 16L, 16R, namely the portion (floor tunnel portion) located between the right and left leg portions of a rider, and in that exposed portion the body frame F constitutes a part of an appearance member of the body frame F. [W10]<br>
Inside the left and right rear covers 16L, 16R are accommodated a container box 18.. for the storage of a helmet 17, etc., an oil tank 19 and a fuel tank 20, whose upper portions are covered with a seat 21 which can be opened and closed.<br>
As is seen from Figs. 3 and 4, the body frame F formed by integral casting of an aluminum alloy is provided with a battery box 26 in front of the head pipe 1 to carry a battery therein.  Contiguous to the rear portion of the head pipe 1 is a main frame 27 of a generally inverted U shape (see Fig. 7) in which is formed a tunnel portion 100, the tunnel portion 100 opening downward and extending in the longitudinal direction.  Further, a generally flat rear frame 28 is contiguous to the rear portion of the main frame 27.  From the lower end of the head pipe 1 up to the front lower edge of the main frame 27 there are formed four boss portions 2?! ... on each of both right and left sides, and a pair of right and left frame rigidity adjusting members 29, 29, which are iron plates, are fixed to the boss portions 27i ... with bolts 30.<br>
As is seen from Fig. 10, clamps 29 i are respectively integral with the frame rigidity adjusting members 29 to clamp cables and hoses 33 such as, for example, throttle cable, wire harness and- brake hose. Thus, it is no longer necessary to use a special clamp member and the number of components used decreases.  As in a modification shown in Fig. 11, the left and right frame<br>
rigidity adjusting members 29, 29 may be integrally connected together in U- shape in section .<br>
As is apparent from both Figs. 7 and 8, at the right and left lower edges and vicinities thereof of the main frame 27 there are formed, throughout the overall length thereof, upper projections 272, 272 and lower projections 273, 273 at a predetermined spacing and in parallel, and guide slots 274, 274 are formed between both projections 272, 272 and 273, 273.  On the right and left lower portions of the main frame 27 are formed a pair of right and left boss portions 275, 275 (see Fig. 7) which support the front portion of a floor bracket 36 to be described later and are also formed retaining projections 276, 276 (see Fig. 8) which support to-be-retained portions 14i, 14i projected on the undersides of the left and right floor panels 14L, 14R.  Further projected on the main frame 27 are a pair of right and left retaining projections 27 7, 277 (see Figs. 3 and 5) which support the underside of the leg shield rear 13.<br>
As is apparent from Figs. 3 and 9, a right hanger bracket 2 81 is integrally projected on the underside of the rear frame 28 at a position close to the right-hand side.<br>
The interior of the right hanger bracket 28i is hollow, and a drain hole 286 is formed in a lower position of the rear side of right hanger bracket 286. Also on the underside of the rear frame 28 and at a position close to the left-hand side is formed a left hanger bracket 31 with two bolts 32, 32.  The left hanger bracket 31, which is formed by an iron plate, cooperates with the right hanger bracket 28].. Further, in each of the right and left side faces of the rear frame 28 are formed two bolt holes 284, 284 for fixing the sub-frame 9.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in the rear frame 28 is formed a container recess 2813 whose upper portion is open.  The container recess 2813 comprises a front wall 289 which rises upward, a rear wall 2810, and left and right walls 28n, 2812.  The container box 18 is secured to the rear frame 28 so that at least a portion thereof is received in the container recess 2813.<br>
In the rear frame 28, moreover, there are formed two bolt holes 282, 282 for insertion therethrough of two bolts 32, 32 for fixing the left hanger bracket 31 and are also formed a plurality of bolt holes 283 for insertion therethrough of bolts (not shown) for fixing the container<br>
box 18.  Further, in the central portion of the rear frame 28 is formed a maintenance opening 287 for the mounting and removal of an exhaust valve 10 (see Fig. 2) or of a spark plug. Behind the maintenance opening 287 is mounted the oil tank 19 and is formed a hose passing hole 288 for the supply of oil from the oil tank 19 to the engine 5.  On the left-hand side of the hose passing hole 288 is formed a rear cushion mounting portion 2814.<br>
Fig. 12 is a vertical sectional view of a die D for forming the body frame F of the above construction by die casting.  The die D comprises a fixed die Dl7 a movable die D2 and a sliding die D3.  Split surfaces of the fixed die D! and the movable die D2 lie on a central plane of a cavity C in the body frame F.  By pouring molten metal from a plurality (say, four) gates G formed in the split surfaces of both fixed and movable dies , the molten metal cab be allowed to spread uniformly throughout the cavity C which is of a symmetric shape, and it is possible to obtain the body frame F of a high quality which is uniform right and left. A longitudinally extending rib' 278 (see Figs. 3 and 4) is formed centrally on the upper surface of the main frame 27 of the body frame F.  When the edge of the rib 278 is subjected to a finishing work after casting of the body<br>
frame F, the gate portion contiguous thereto is separated automatically, whereby the connected part of the gate portion is made inconspicuous and the beautiful appearance of the body frame F can be improved thereby.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 to 9, the main frame 27 is provided with a floor bracket (reinforcing member) 36 for not only supporting the left and right floor panels 14L/ 14R but also reinforcing the main frame 27.  The floor bracket 36 comprises a pair of left and right side members 37L/ 37R extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body, a cross member 38 which connects between the front ends of both side members 37L, 37R, a pair of left and right front fixing members 39L, 39R attached to the cross member 38, and a pair of left and right rear fixing members 40L, 40R attached to the rear portions of the side members 37L and 37R, respectively.  A horn 41 is fixed to the central part of the cross member 38 so as to face forward in the tunnel portion 100.  The front portion of the floor bracket 36 is secured to the body frame F by fixing the front fixing members. 39if 39R to the boss portions 275, 275 with bolts 42, 42 (see Fig. 7).  On the other hand, the rear portion of the floor bracket 36 is secured to the body frame F by fixing the rear fixing<br>
members 40L, 40R to the left and right brackets 31, 28X with a pivot bolt 43 (see Fig. 9).<br>
As is apparent from Figs. 6 to 8, the left and right floor panels 14L, 14R are secured to the front portions of the side members 37L/ 37R of the floor bracket 36 with a pair of left and right bolts 44, 44 and are also secured to the rear portions of both side members with a pair of left and right bolts 45, 45, while their inner edges are engaged in the guide slots 274, 274 of the main frame 27.  At this time, the undersides of the to-be-retained portions 14i, 14i projected on the undersides of the floor panels 14L, 14R are supported by the upper surfaces of the retaining projections 276, 276 of the main frame 27 (see Fig. 8).<br>
Thus, the inner edges of the floor panels 14L and 14R are supported by the guide slots 274, 274 formed between the upper projections 272, 272 and the lower projections 273, 27 3 of the main frame 27, and the to-be-retained portions 14l7 14i are supported ..by -the retaining projections 276, 276 of the main frame 27, so that the load such as, for example, the weight of the rider, acting on the floor panels 14L, 14R can be surely transmitted to the<br>
main frame 27 and thus the load imposed on the floor bracket 36 can be dispersed to the main frame.  Besides, even if there is a slight dimensional error between the main frame 27 and the floor panels 14L, 14R, such a dimensional error is absorbed at the portion where the inner edges of the floor panels 14L, 14R are engaged in the guide slots 274, 274.  Therefore, it is possible to prevent the formation of a gap in that portion and hence possible to improve the beautiful appearance.<br>
Likewise, the leg shield rear 13 is fixed while its inner edges are engaged in the guide slots 274, 274 and the undersides of its inner edges are abutted against the retaining projections 277, 277 (see Fig. 3).  In this way the leg shield rear 13 can be supported firmly on the main frame 27 so as to withstand the pressure of running wind and so as not to form any gap between both components . [JQJD23] ...<br>
As is apparent from Figs. 5, 6 and 9, the power unit hanger link 7, which supports the front end of the power unit P vertically swingably .for the body frame F, comprises an outer pipe 46, annular elastic members 47, 47 fixed by fusion-bonding to the inner peripheries at both ends of the outer pipe 46, a pair of right and left inner<br>
pipes 48, 48 fixed by fusion-bonding to the inner peripheries of both elastic members 47, 47, a distance collar 49 disposed between both inner pipes 48, 48, a pair of stays 50, 50 extending backward and downward from the outer pipe 46, a rear pipe 51 which connects the rear ends of both stays 50, 50, a stopper arm 52 extending forward and upward from the outer pipe 46, and an elastic member 53 provided at the front end of the stopper arm 52 .<br>
The pivot bolt 43 extends through the left-hand rear fixing member 40L of the floor bracket 36, left hanger bracket 31 formed by an iron plate and fixed to the rear frame 28, left inner pipe 48, distance collar 49, right inner pipe 48, washer 54, right hanger bracket 28 formed in the rear frame 28 and further through the right-hand rear fixing member 40R of the floor bracket 36, and is threadedly engaged with a nut 55.  The rear pipe 51 is connected to the front end of the power unit P with bolt (not shown).  Thus, while the power unit hanger link 7 is supported on the underside of the rear frame 28, the stopper arm 52 and the elastic member' 53 provided at the front end of the stopper arm are accommodated in a recess 2 85 (see Fig. 5) formed in the rear frame 28. A pivotal end of the power unit hanger link 7 is restricted by<br>
abutment of the elastic member 53 against the upper wall surface of the recess 285.<br>
When the power unit P swings vertically, the elastic members 47, 47 which connect the outer pipe 46 and the inner pipes 48, 48 with each other are twisted, while upon vertical or longitudinal motion of the power unit P, the elastic members 47, 47 are compressed in the radial direction, to buffer vibrations.  When the pivot bolt 43 is tightened, the left hanger bracket 31, which is formed by an iron plate, is deformed elastically in the transverse direction, so that that axial force of the pivot bolt 43 can be stabilized.  Besides, it is possible to prevent a heavy load from being imposed on the right hanger bracket 28i which is formed of an aluminum allow of a relatively high rigidity. If the load inputted through the power unit hanger link 7 from the power unit P is to be borne by only the left and right hanger brackets 31, 28j, there arises the necessity of enhancing the strength of the hanger brackets 31 and 2.8 lf thus giving rise to the problem of an increase of weight.  In this embodiment, however, since the left and right hanger brackets 31, 28j are connected to the central portion of the main frame 27 through the floor bracket 36, it is possible to disperse the load which is inputted to the hanger brackets 31 and 28^.  Consequently, it is possible to reduce the size and weight of those hanger brackets .<br>
Although the left and right side members 37L, 37R of the floor bracket 36 are connected together at their front ends by means of the cross member 38, the left and right rear fixing members 40L, 40R disposed on the rear end side are not connected directly with each other, but are connected indirectly with each other through the pivot bolt 43.  It is generally known that the steering stability of a two-wheeled motor vehicle is enhanced when the frame rigidity is low to a moderate extent.  If the rear ends of the left and right side members 37L, 37R are connected together using a special cross member, it is likely that the frame rigidity will become excessive, coupled with the increase of rigidity by the pivot bolt 43.<br>
In this embodiment, however, "such a cross member which connects the rear ends of the left and right side members 37L, 37R is omitted and the function thereof is taken charge of by the pivot bolt 43, so that not only it<br>
is possible to lower the frame rigidity to a moderate extent and enhance the steering stability but also the reduction of both weight and cost can be attained by the reduction in the number of components used.<br>
Besides, since the horn 41 is disposed forward in the tunnel portion 100 which is formed in the body frame F so as to open downward, it is no longer necessary that the horn 41 be mounted in the complicated components layout in the leg shield front upper 11 of the vehicle body, and it is possible to diminish the dead space in the tunnel portion 100.<br>
•<br>
Consequently, not only it becomes possible to simplify the structure for mounting the horn 41 but also it is possible to utilize the tunnel portion 100 of the body frame F effectively.  Moreover, by eliminating the horn from the interior of the leg shield front upper 11, it is made possible to simplify the structure for mounting the components which remain in the leg shield front upper 11. Further, since the horn 41 is disposed so as to face forward, there is obtained an appropriate sound generating direction. Moreover, since the tunnel portion 100 is located so as to cover the horn 41, it is possible to improve the acoustic effect for the sound generated from<br>
the horn 41.<br>
Additionally, since the horn 41 is supported by the floor bracket 36 which is mounted to the body frame F so as to span the tunnel portion 100 for reinforcement, it is possible to omit the components which are used only for supporting the horn 41.  Thus, it is possible to suppress the increase in the number of components required in disposing the horn 41 in the tunnel portion 41. [0030]<br>
Although an embodiment of the present invention has been described above in detail, various design modifications may be made within the scope not departing from the gist of the invention.<br>
For example, although in the above embodiment, the body frame F is formed using an aluminum alloy, it may be formed using another light alloy or synthetic resin. Moreover, the body cover portions supported by the guide slots 274, 274 are not limited to the leg shield rear 13 and the floor panels 14L, 14R, but -there may be used any other body cover portions.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As set forth above, according to the horn mounting structure in a two-wheeled motor vehicle defined in claim 1 of the present invention, a tunnel portion is formed in the body frame behind the head, pipe so as to be open downward and a horn is disposed in the tunnel portion so as to face forward. Therefore, the interior space of the body frame, which has so far been a dead space, can be utilized effectively.  Thus, the degree of freedom in the mounting of the horn is enhanced.  Besides, since the horn faces forward and the body frame, which is open downward, also serves as a trumpet-shaped loudening portion, it is possible to suppress the sound volume of the horn to a minimum required volume.<br>
