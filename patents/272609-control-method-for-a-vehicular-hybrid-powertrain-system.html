				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING A HYBRID<br>
POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/986,073 filed on 11/07/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure pertains generally to control systems for powertrain<br>
systems utilizing electro-mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output. The output is operatively<br>
connected to a driveline for a motor vehicle. One exemplary powertrain<br>
includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which<br>
utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from a prime mover<br>
power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output<br>
member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to the vehicle<br>
driveline. Electric machines, operable as motors or generators, generate a<br>
torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle<br>
kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy<br>
potential that is storable in an electrical energy storage device. A control<br>
system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides<br>
operational control of the powertrain system, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between<br>
the electrical energy storage device and the electric machines. A control<br>
system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides<br>
operational control of the powertrain system, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between<br>
the electrical energy storage device and the electric machines. Known system<br>
torques that can vary during powertrain operation include hydraulic pumps<br>
supplying pressurized hydraulic fluid to actuate various clutch devices in the<br>
transmission and provide system cooling. Known transmission gears and<br>
other rotating components generate momentums and inertias which affect<br>
torque output. Known electrically-powered accessories generate varying<br>
electrical loading which affect operation.<br>
(0005] Known control systems monitor various inputs from the vehicle<br>
and the operator and provide operational control of the powertrain system,<br>
including controlling transmission operating state and gear shifting,<br>
controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical power<br>
interchange between the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines. Known control systems for hybrid powertrains interactively control<br>
the internal combustion engine and the electric machines to transmit<br>
mechanical torque and electric power to meet an operator torque request for<br>
tractive torque. Such systems act to simultaneously optimize vehicle fuel<br>
economy, minimize vehicle exhaust emissions, and meet design life goals for<br>
an electric energy storage device, e.g., a high voltage battery pack, and take<br>
into consideration other requirements related to driveability, system<br>
robustness, and accessory loading. The systems operate by accurately<br>
measuring vehicle load demands, determining the capability of the energy<br>
storage devices, determining desired propulsion system operating conditions<br>
for optimal fuel economy, and implementing the desired propulsion system<br>
operating conditions.<br>
[0006] A powertrain may have a need for service, including diagnostic<br>
analysis related to vehicle operation and engine operation. Operation of the<br>
engine independently of the hybrid powertrain is useful during diagnostic<br>
analysis in order to identify and isolate a fault and verify any subsequent<br>
repair.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] A vehicular hybrid powertrain system includes an engine and an<br>
electric machine selectively operatively coupled to a transmission device to<br>
transmit torque therebetween. A control method for the system includes<br>
monitoring operator inputs to an accelerator pedal and a transmission gear<br>
selector, and determining an operator torque request based upon the operator<br>
inputs to the accelerator pedal and the transmission gear selector. Torque<br>
output from the electric machine is commanded based upon the operator<br>
torque request. Engine output is controlled based upon the operator torque<br>
request and the commanded torque output from the electric machine. Vehicle<br>
hood position is monitored and the engine output is controlled correlative to<br>
the operator input to the accelerator pedal when the monitored position of the<br>
vehicle hood is open and the operator input to the transmission gear selector is<br>
one of a PARK and a NEUTRAL position.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
[0009] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary vehicle and<br>
powertrain; and<br>
[0010] Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an algorithmic flowchart.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Fig. 1 schematically depicts a vehicle 100<br>
including a powertrain and control system comprising an engine 14, two-<br>
mode, compound-split electro-mechanical transmission 10 including first and<br>
second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72, and a plurality of<br>
control modules, which has been configured to execute the control scheme<br>
described and depicted herein. The vehicle 100 includes a hood 102 by which<br>
the hybrid powertrain can be accessed when opened. Opening and closing of<br>
the hood 102 is monitored by a hood switch 112 ('HS').<br>
[0012] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 has a crankshaft (not shown)<br>
which is operatively connected to the input shaft 12. The crankshaft is<br>
monitored by a sensing device adapted to monitor rotational position and<br>
speed ('NE'). Output of the engine is characterized in terms of the rotational<br>
speed and an engine output torque ('TE'). The exemplary engine includes a<br>
device to control flow rate of intake air to the engine 14, depicted in this<br>
embodiment as an electronically controlled throttle device ('ETC') 15, which<br>
correspondingly controls rotational speed of the engine 14 when the engine 14<br>
comprises a spark-ignition engine. Operation of the engine, including the<br>
electronically controlled throttle device 15, is controlled by an engine control<br>
module (hereafter 'ECM') 23. Other devices can be utilized to effectively<br>
control engine intake air. Rotational speed of the engine 14 can be controlled<br>
by other control mechanisms (not shown) including, e.g., control of fuel<br>
injection timing and mass when the engine 14 comprises a compression-<br>
ignition engine.<br>
[0013] The transmission 10 preferably includes one or more planetary-<br>
gear sets (not shown) and one or more selectively appliable torque-<br>
transmitting clutches (not shown), the input shaft 12, and an output shaft 64.<br>
The transmission 10 is selectively operative in one of a plurality of gear/mode<br>
operating states, comprising one or more fixed gear operating states and one or<br>
more continuously variable mode operating states, by selective actuation of<br>
the torque-transmitting clutches. Each of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 is preferably operatively connected to the transmission via<br>
one of the planetary gear sets. The first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 comprise three-phase AC electric machines operative as motor/generator<br>
devices, and each includes a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not shown). The<br>
motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer transmission case (not<br>
shown), and the motor rotor connects to one or more of the planetary gear sets<br>
and/or the output shaft 64. The transmission is controlled in one of the<br>
gear/mode operating states by a transmission control module (hereafter<br>
'TCM') 17. The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled<br>
by first and second motor control modules ('MCP-A') 22 and ('MCP-B') 33,<br>
described hereinbelow. Operation of the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 is monitored using sensing systems comprising resolvers (not shown)<br>
which provide rotational speeds, referred to as NA and NB respectively. The<br>
output shaft 64 is operably connected to a vehicle driveline (not shown) to<br>
provide an output torque ('TO') to vehicle wheels (not shown). There is a<br>
transmission output speed sensor (not shown) adapted to monitor rotational<br>
speed and rotational direction of the output shaft 64.<br>
[0014] An electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74 comprises<br>
a high-voltage device adapted to store electric energy, and can comprise a<br>
battery system, an ultracapacitor system, or other device. The ESD 74 is high<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the first and second motor control modules 22 and 33<br>
via DC transfer conductors 27. The first motor control module 22 transmits<br>
electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the second motor control module 33 similarly transmits<br>
electrical power to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer<br>
conductors 31. Electrical power is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in<br>
accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. The first<br>
and second motor control modules 22 and 33 comprise power inverters (not<br>
shown) and respective motor control modules configured to receive motor<br>
control commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality. The power inverters of the first and<br>
second motor control modules 22 and 33 comprise known complementary<br>
three-phase power electronics devices, and each includes controlled insulated<br>
gate bipolar transistors ('IGBT') (not shown) for converting DC power from<br>
the ESD 74 to AC power for powering one of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. There is one pair of<br>
IGBTs for each phase of each of the three-phase first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0015] The transmission 10 receives input torque from torque-generative<br>
devices including the engine 14, and the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored<br>
in the ESD 74. The transmission 10 transmits the input torque from the engine<br>
14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to the output, e.g., the<br>
driveline, via the planetary gears through selective application of the torque<br>
transfer clutches.<br>
[0016] The control system for the powertrain system comprises an<br>
architecture consisting of distributed control modules. The elements described<br>
hereinafter comprise a subset of a control module architecture for overall<br>
control of the vehicle 100, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system synthesizes pertinent<br>
information and inputs, and executes algorithms to control various actuators to<br>
achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions,<br>
performance, driveability, and protection of hardware, including batteries<br>
contained within the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. The distributed control module architecture includes ECM 23, TCM 17, a<br>
battery pack control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and a transmission power<br>
inverter module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, which includes a hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 and the first and second motor control modules 22<br>
and 33 in the embodiment described. This control module configuration<br>
includes a full-duplex synchronous serial data link (not shown) thus permitting<br>
direct communication between the HCP 5 and the first and second motor<br>
control modules 22 and 33 for high-speed communications without<br>
communications delays. Furthermore, data and messages are communicated<br>
between the HCP 5 and first and second motor control modules 22 and 33 over<br>
a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus 6.<br>
[0017] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of the<br>
ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21. A user interface ('UP) 13 is<br>
operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator controls and directs operation of the powertrain. Based upon inputs<br>
from the user interface 13 and the powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP<br>
5 generates commands to control operation of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
including: an operator torque request ('TOREQ'), a commanded output<br>
torque to driveline 90, the engine input torque, clutch torques for the various<br>
transmission clutches; and motor torque commands ('TA' and 'TB'<br>
respectively) for first and second motor control modules 22 and 33 to control<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72, respectively.<br>
[0018] The ECM 23 is directly connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators of<br>
the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as aggregate<br>
line 35. For simplicity, the ECM 23 is shown bi-directionally interfacing with<br>
engine 14 via the aggregate line 35. Engine parameters monitored by the<br>
ECM 23 include engine coolant temperature, the engine input speed to the<br>
input shaft 12, intake manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, ambient<br>
pressure, and states of engine actuators. Various actuators that may be<br>
controlled by the ECM 23, while not separately shown, include fuel injectors,<br>
ignition modules, the electronically controlled throttle device 15, EGR valves,<br>
turbocharger devices, and others. The ECM 23 receives the engine input<br>
torque from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an indication<br>
of actual engine input torque to the transmission 10, which is communicated to<br>
the HCP 5. The HCP 5 can command a positive engine input torque, a<br>
negative engine input torque, or zero engine input torque including a<br>
command to shut the engine off during operation of the vehicle 100.<br>
[0019] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission 10 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 41. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each clutch and a rotational output speed of the<br>
output shaft 64 from a transmission output sensor (not shown). Other<br>
actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the<br>
TCM 17 to the HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs<br>
from pressure switches and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and<br>
shift solenoids to actuate the clutches (not shown) to achieve various<br>
transmission operating states.<br>
[0020] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors (not<br>
shown) operable to monitor electrical current and voltage parameters of the<br>
ESD 74 to provide information about states of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. Such<br>
information includes ESD state-of-charge, electrical current flow between the<br>
ESD 74 and TPIM 19 in terms of amp-hour throughput, ESD 74 voltage, and<br>
minimum and maximum available electrical power from the ESD 74, referred<br>
to herein as Pbat_min and Pbat_max.<br>
[0021] The user interface 13 is signally connected to a plurality of devices<br>
through which a vehicle operator controls and directs operation of the<br>
powertrain, including the transmission 10. The devices include an accelerator<br>
pedal ('AP') 113, an operator brake pedal ('BP') 115, transmission gear<br>
selector ('PRNDL') 114, hood switch 112, and, a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The accelerator pedal 113 preferably comprises foot pedal<br>
device depressible by the vehicle operator. The accelerator pedal 113<br>
generates a signal output that varies linearly based upon operator depression of<br>
the pedal. When there is no depression of the accelerator pedal 113, the signal<br>
output is readable as 0%, and when the accelerator pedal 113 is fully<br>
depressed, the signal output is readable as 100%. The HCP 5 determines the<br>
operator torque request based upon the input from the accelerator pedal 113.<br>
The brake pedal 115 preferably comprises a foot pedal device depressible by<br>
the vehicle operator. The brake pedal 115 generates a signal output that varies<br>
based upon magnitude of operator force in depressing the pedal. When there<br>
is no depression of the brake pedal 115, the signal output is readable as 0%,<br>
and when the brake pedal 115 is fully depressed, the signal output is readable<br>
as 100%. The HCP 5 determines a braking command and an electrical<br>
regeneration command based upon the input from brake pedal 115. The<br>
transmission gear selector 114 preferably comprises a known device having a<br>
discrete number of operator-selectable positions. The transmission gear<br>
selector 114 generates a signal correlative to each of operator-selectable<br>
positions, comprising PARK ('P'), REVERSE ('R'), NEUTRAL ('N'),<br>
DRIVE ('D'), and, LOW ('L'), based upon position. The hood switch 112<br>
preferably comprises a known device comprising any one of a plurality of<br>
electro-mechanical or solid state devices operative to generate a first discrete<br>
signal output indicating the hood 102 is closed and a second discrete output<br>
indicating the hood 102 is open. When the hood switch 112 indicates that the<br>
hood 102 is opened, a control scheme in the HCP 5 adapts operation of the<br>
powertrain control system to modify operation of the powertrain, as is<br>
described herein with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
[0022] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via the LAN bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol<br>
utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols<br>
provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between<br>
the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability<br>
Multiple communications buses may be used to improve communications<br>
speed and provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity.<br>
[0023] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and<br>
BPCM 21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory, electrically programmable read only memory, random access<br>
memory, a high speed clock, analog to digital and digital to analog circuitry,<br>
and input/output circuitry and devices and appropriate signal conditioning and<br>
buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in ROM and<br>
executed to provide the respective functions of each computer. Information<br>
transfer between the various computers is preferably accomplished using the<br>
aforementioned LAN bus 6.<br>
[0024] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle<br>
operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
occurrence of an event.<br>
[0025] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the user interface<br>
13, the HCP 5 and one or more of the other control modules determine the<br>
commanded torque output to be effected at the output shaft 64 to meet the<br>
operator torque request. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other<br>
factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The<br>
transmission 10 is controlled to a preferred one of the gear/mode operating<br>
states based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes the operator torque request, communicated through the inputs to the<br>
user interface 13 as previously described. The preferred operating state may<br>
be predicated on a powertrain torque demand caused by a control module<br>
command to operate the electric machines in an electrical power generating<br>
mode or in a torque generating mode.<br>
[0026] The preferred operating state can be determined by an optimization<br>
algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum system efficiency based<br>
upon the operator torque request, the state-of-charge of the ESD 74, and<br>
energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72. During normal operation, the HCP 5 manages the torque output by<br>
monitoring and managing input torques from the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. The HCP 5 uses the operator torque<br>
request to calculate an optimum input torque to the transmission 10, including<br>
a preferred transmission gear/mode operating state and a preferred engine<br>
input speed to the transmission 10. The HCP 5 determines a constrained<br>
operating space for operating the engine 14, transmission 10, and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 based upon the optimum input torque and<br>
torque output potential of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, the<br>
minimum and maximum available electrical power from the ESD 74, the state-<br>
of-charge of the ESD 74, and related system equations. This includes the<br>
HCP 5 identifying available transmission gear/mode operating states and a<br>
region comprising engine and motor torques usable to achieve the commanded<br>
output torque at the output shaft 64 based upon the operator inputs determined<br>
from the user interface 13. Cost functions are used to determine the preferred<br>
gear/mode operating state and engine input speed to the transmission within<br>
the operating state and the usable engine and motor torque region. The HCP 5<br>
commands the ECM 23 to control the engine 14 and commands first and<br>
second motor control modules 22 and 33 to control the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to provide outputs to meet the operator torque<br>
request. The HCP 5 arbitrates the commanded engine torque and motor torque<br>
commands against torque interventions, including transmission shift torque<br>
management and engine start/stop torque control. Final arbitrated torque<br>
commands for the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 are output, limited by the system constraints of power and torque. The<br>
control system manages the torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 to the transmission 10 based upon an<br>
outcome of the executed optimization routine, with the system efficiencies<br>
optimized to improve fuel economy and manage battery charging.<br>
Furthermore, system operation can be controlled based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the<br>
torque-generative devices and determines the output of the transmission 10<br>
required to arrive at the output torque to meet the operator torque request.<br>
Thus during ongoing operation of the powertrain, the HCP 5 controls<br>
operation of the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72,<br>
and the transmission 10 to generate output which meets the operator inputs as<br>
determined through the user interface 13.<br>
[0027] Fig. 2 depicts a flowchart 200 for monitoring and controlling<br>
operation of the vehicle 100 and the powertrain system, which is executed as<br>
machine code, preferably in the HCP 5. When the flowchart 200 is<br>
completely executed, the HCP 5 effects operating the engine 14 specifically<br>
responsive to the operator input through the user interface 13, independently<br>
of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and the transmission 10.<br>
The user interface 13 regularly monitors inputs from the hood switch 112, the<br>
accelerator pedal 113, the transmission gear selector 114, and, the brake pedal<br>
115, preferably during one of the loop cycles described above (202). During<br>
ongoing operation, the HCP 5 determines the operator torque request based<br>
upon the operator input to the user interface 13, comprising position of the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 and the position of the transmission gear selector 114<br>
(204). The HCP 5 controls oversees operation of the engine 14 and the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 to generate and transmit the torque<br>
output via the transmission 10 to the output shaft to achieve the operator<br>
torque request, as described above (206). This operation is ongoing during<br>
operation of the vehicle 100.<br>
[0028] When the transmission gear selector 114 is in either the PARK<br>
position or the NEUTRAL position the HCP 5 controls the operation to<br>
optimize torque and achieve predetermined goals related to fuel efficiency and<br>
overall energy management. Thus, powertrain operation can include the HCP<br>
5 commanding the ECM 23 to shut off the engine 14 or operate the engine 14<br>
in a cylinder deactivation mode to conserve fuel. Powertrain operation can<br>
include the HCP 5 commanding the TCM 17 to selectively actuating one or<br>
more of the clutches to transmit torque from the engine 14 to one of the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72 to generate electric power to increase<br>
the state-of-charge of the ESD 74 and to support accessory loading from the<br>
vehicle 100.<br>
[0029] When there is an input indicating an intent to service the vehicle<br>
100, the HCP 5 changes operation. The input indicating an intent to service<br>
the vehicle 100 comprises the input signal from the hood switch 112 indicating<br>
that the hood 102 is opened, and the input from the transmission gear selector<br>
114 indicating an operator request for one of the PARK position and the<br>
NEUTRAL position (208). Subsequently and in response thereto, a control<br>
scheme in the HCP 5 adapts operation of the powertrain control system to<br>
modify operation of the powertrain. The HCP 5 adapts operation of the<br>
powertrain to control engine output linearly correlative to the operator input to<br>
the accelerator pedal 113. This operation comprises inducing a change in the<br>
engine output speed based upon operator input to the accelerator pedal 113.<br>
When there is no operator input to the accelerator pedal 113, e.g., no<br>
depression of the accelerator pedal 113 by the operator, the accelerator pedal<br>
113 signal output is readable as 0%, and the engine operates at an idle<br>
condition. Similarly, when the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113<br>
consists of the accelerator pedal 113 fully depressed by the operator, the signal<br>
output is readable as 100%, and the engine operates at a maximum engine<br>
speed (210). The engine speed ranges linearly between the idle speed and the<br>
maximum engine speed as the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113<br>
varies from no operator depression to full depression. In the embodiment<br>
described, the HCP 5 commands the ECM 23 to induce change in the engine<br>
speed by controlling opening position of the electronically controlled throttle<br>
device 15 to control the intake airflow. Thus, when the output of the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 is 0%, the electronically controlled throttle device 15 is<br>
controlled to a substantially closed position, yet open sufficiently to operate<br>
the engine at idle speed. When the output of the accelerator pedal 113 is<br>
100%, the electronically controlled throttle device 15 is controlled to a<br>
substantially wide-open position, permitting and causing the rotational speed<br>
of the engine 14 to increase and approach maximum speed, with the engine<br>
speed limited by operating characteristics of the engine (212).<br>
[0030] The system operation further comprises operation to control torque<br>
outputs, TA and TB respectively, from the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72 when the hood switch 112 is open and the transmission gear selector<br>
114 is in one of the PARK and the NEUTRAL position (214). Torque outputs<br>
from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled by<br>
controlling electric loading and electric power flow in the system between<br>
ESD 74 and either of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. This is<br>
accomplished by controlling torque outputs from both the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., TA and TB, to zero torque, including<br>
controlling torque output from both the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 to a net-zero torque by applying a positive torque to one of the electric<br>
machines and an equivalent magnitude of negative torque to the other of the<br>
electric machines. A preferred method to accomplish the zero torque output in<br>
the exemplary embodiment is to constrain a change in the state-of-charge of<br>
the ESD 74, by limiting electric loading, e.g., limiting operation of<br>
electrically-powered accessories, and limiting increases in the state-of-charge<br>
of the ESD 74 by limiting the electrical current flow. Constraining changes in<br>
the state-of-charge of the ESD can also be accomplished by constraining the<br>
minimum and maximum battery powers, PBat_min, Pbat_max, to<br>
predetermined levels that are less than the calibrated minimum and maximum<br>
battery power occurring when the hood 102 is closed (214).<br>
[0031] System operation to control torque output from the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 can include controlling electric power flow to a<br>
predetermined electric load, which is applied to the engine to induce a torque<br>
load thereon. For example, the input shaft 12 from the engine 14 can be<br>
operatively connected to the first electric machine 56 such that power output<br>
from the engine is directly transmitted to the first electric machine 56 and<br>
decoupled from the driveline when the electro-mechanical transmission 10<br>
operates in a gear/mode operating state comprising an input-split operating<br>
state. Thus torque generated in the first electric machine 56, i.e., TA, is<br>
applied to the engine based upon the operator input to the brake pedal 115<br>
(216).<br>
