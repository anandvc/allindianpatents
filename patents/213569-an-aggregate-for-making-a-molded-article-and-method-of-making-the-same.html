AN AGGREGATE FOR MAKING A MOLDED ARTICLE AND METHOD  <br>
OF MAKING THE SAME <br>

of Bhavnagar Rajkot Highway, NavagaM, Post Vartej 364 060,<br>
Dist.Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India, an Indian National; and<br>
(b)ASHWIN PAREKH<br>
of Bhavnagar Rajkot Highway, Navagam, Post Vartej 364 060,<br>
Dist.Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India, an Indian National<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
The invention relates to a novel process for making an aggregate, an aggregate made from the process and to a process of molding articles there from.<br>
Articles that can be made from the novel aggregate in accordance with this invention include fixtures such as kitchen molded articles bathroom basins, counters for kitchens, bathtubs, shower cubicle bases and the like and other articles of a decorative or utility nature such as tiles for wall cladding and flooring. The aggregate is such that not only is the final product abrasive resistant but it also has the appearance of natural stone.<br>
The novel aggregate in accordance with this invention includes a curable resin matrix, which can be polymerized, and at least one anti abrasive. In accordance with one aspect of this invention there is provided a method of forming the novel aggregate.<br>
In the prior art, the use of a free-flowing mixture made from a solution of polymethyl methacrylate in methyl methacrylate and a filler material consisting of Silicon dioxide particles is known. In the prior art mixture, the proportion of filler amounts to 62% to 66% by weight, and quartz is used as an anti abrasives which is previously recrystallized in a furnace to cristo-balite and then ground up so the majority of the anti abrasives particles have a size of between 5 .mu.m and 50 .mu.m.<br><br><br>
Articles made from this material are susceptibility to visible scratch marks or to unremovable stains on the visible side of the articles, they also have an artifical appearance.<br>
Another aggregate known in the prior art essentially uses the same resin mix but a majority of mineral anti abrasives particles having a size of between approximately 0.1 mm and approximately 2 mm, and with the addition that the particles are required to have an unbroken grain shape, and constitute about 50% to 85%o by weight, in particular, approximately 60%&gt; to 80% by weight, of the aggregate.<br>
In the rest of this specification articles made from such a aggregates will be referred to as a molded article of the prior art.<br>
This prior art aggregate and articles made therefrom suffer from several inherent defects, which include the following:<br>
1. The aggregate and the articles made therefrom are significantly brittle, porous and have a relatively rough surface, particularly on the vertical walls, which in turn results in scale deposition on the articles in use made from the said aggregate. The use of mineral anti abrasives particles in significant quantities causes greater shrinking of resin for example, pure acrylic resin shrinks by 22%.   Consequently, microscopic depressions are formed<br><br><br>
between the anti abrasives particles which are close to the surface which results in scale deposition of the articles made from the aggregate of the prior art.<br>
2.	The scale formed is difficult to clear.<br>
3.	Due to higher density of the base the weight of the article made from the aggregate is more and therefore :<br><br>
(a)	Transportation costs are relatively high<br>
(b)	Packing cost are high<br>
( c ) Breakage during transport is high on rough roads due to weight impact as well as cantilever action, (d)     The scoring resistance is not acceptable and even light pressures on the component results in visible scoring.<br>
4.	The tensile strength of .the aggregate and of the article made there from is relatively low.<br>
5.	It has been experienced that articles made from the prior art aggregate suffer from the defect that there is a significant chance of damage to tap hole areas while tapping and because the resin is less in the socket and other areas required for clamping of the article, it results in poor griping of clamping screw in the socket.<br>
6.	The elasticity and resilience of the aggregate and the article made therefrom is relatively low, this not only results in bending of the article off a horizontal or vertical axis but even when bending is there then installation is hard, because straightening by tightening clamps is hard due to low resilience and less elasticity.<br><br><br>
7.	Due to a relatively lower quantity of resin by weight, bonding with solid particles within the aggregate is poor.<br>
8.	The surface is dull and because it is relatively rough there is a greater probability that there will be more penetration of external food and dirt particles.<br>
9.	Screwing of clamp is relatively time consuming and tedious and this also effect the life of the drill bit and screw bit.<br>
10.The pressure vessel used as the apparatus for forming the aggregate is tedious to clean and this operation is more time consuming, since resin is less, viscosity of resin is also low.<br>
11.	Wearing of the mold is relatively significant, since a high<br>
percentage of solid particles, while mould filling cause more<br>
scratches polishing frequency of mold is high.<br>
12.	 Operating range of viscosity is short under tropical conditions.<br>
13. Machining tool life for example edge cutting tool, waste hole<br>
drilling tool, overflow-drilling tool is relatively less in the prior art articles because of the high anti abrasives content. 14. Cleaning of the articles is not easy.<br>
This invention seeks to provide a novel aggregate which decreases   the   aforesaid   drawbacks   and   additionally   has/ improved scoring resistance properties and gives the final1 product a natural finish which has the "look and feel" of granite, marble and other natural materials .<br>

Typically, the peroxide is at least one from a group of peroxides consisting of di lauryl peroxide, tert-butylperbenzoate, bis-4-t-butyl cyclo hexyl peroxidicarbonate.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of this invention there is provided a method of making an aggregate for making a molded article comprising the steps of making a syrup preparation for an acrylate resin matrix by mixing 70 to 80 per cent by weight of methyl methacrylate and 20 to 30 per cent of polymethyl methacrylate in a mixing vessel at temperatures between 30 to 35 degrees C to form a resin matrix being 20 to 55 per cent of the aggregate, adding a cross linking agent such as Trimetholol propane trimethacrylate, an internal lubricant such as stearic acid to the said resin matrix mixture at a temperature between 20 to 25 degrees C and mixing the ingredients,    adding anti abrasive particles between 45 to 80<br><br><br>
per cent of the aggregate, greater than 50 percent of the anti abrasives particles being quartz particles having a size of between 0.1 mm and 1.2 mm, at least 30 per cent of the anti abrasive particles being broken particles having irregular shape with sharp edges, at least 60 per cent of the anti abrasive particulate matter being silanized, 1 to 7 percent of the anti abrasive particles matter having particle size of less than 0.1mm, gradually and under continuous stirring, adding peroxide agent to the mixture to obtain the said aggregate for molding articles.<br>
Typically, in the step of making a syrup preparation, polymethyl methacrylate is added gradually to the methyl methacrylate under continuous stirring and controlled temperature.<br>
The method of making the aggregate of the invention is as follows :<br>

Addition of Cross Linking Agent in Syrup - 2% of MMA + PMMA<br>
Addition of Internal Demoulding Agent/ Lubricating Agent in Syrup      - 0.2% of MMA + PMMA<br>
A  typical   aggregate  preparation   in  accordance  with  this<br>
invention includes the following ingredients:<br>
Base Batch Preparation in small mixing pressure vessels<br>
(a)	Syrup	-        53.98% of total charge<br>
(b)	Anti abrasive        -        43.18% of total charge<br>
(c)	Silica Powder       -        0.98% of total charge<br>
(for better bonding larger particles of anti abrasive helps in<br>
decreasing pin holes &amp; pitting)<br>
(d)	Peroxides as curing agents	-        1.41%<br>
A typical Process in accordance with this invention can be exemplified as follows:<br>
1.   Syrup Preparation<br>
MMA is introduced in a mixing vessel. PMMA in powder/granule form is added gradually with continuous stirring at around 240 r.p.m. Temperature is maintained at about 40° C during syrup preparation. Mixing time is 6Hrs. After mixing the syrup is required to stand and the temperature is maintained at 20 to 25 ° C.<br><br><br>
2.	After syrup preparation is over and temperature 20 - 25 ° C is<br>
attained, cross-linking agent is added and stirring for 1 Hr is done.<br>
3.	Then, Internal Demolding / Lubricating Agent (Stearic Acid) is<br>
added and stirred for another 1 Hr.<br>
4.	Base Batch Preparation:<br>
Depending on various colours required in the article to be formed the batch preparation is done in pressure vessels, as follows :<br>
(a)	Syrup with Cross Linking Agent &amp; Demolding Agent is taken in pressure vessel<br>
(b)	Then anti abrasives are added in pressure vessel and mixed.<br>
(c)	Silica Powder is then added and mixed<br>
(d)	Then peroxides are added<br>
Total mixing time is 1 Hr and during above operation cooling water at 15 to 20° C is continuously circulated in the jacket. After this vacuum of 600 mm is applied for 15   minutes along with mixing.<br>
5.	Then pressure vessel is moved to casting bay, where air pressure<br>
of 5 to 6 kg/Cm2is applied for transferring the material from vessel to mold.<br>
6.	After transferring the material to mold the heating of molds is<br>
done at a predetermined set cycle.<br><br><br>
Top<br>
Time       0        3        7	11      15      20      22      24      25<br>

Temp	20      90	110    End<br>
Filling is done at 20 ° C.	Pressure of 6 Kg/Cm to 8 Kg is<br>
applied to Mold after filling. This is continued till temp. Cycle<br>
is over.<br>
7.	After cycle is completed air pressure is released and clamps<br>
opened. Then top-ejecting air is applied to release top mold sticking to the article. It is then lifted and a bottom air ejector is applied to separate article from the bottom mold. During above period temperature of bottom mold is kept at 60 - 80 ° C for easy release.<br>
8.	After casting the article is clamped on a fixture till it is cooled to<br>
room temp<br>
After cooling is complete the articles declamped from fixture<br>
A variety of thixotropic agents can be applied to the mixture; with acrylic resin, a portion of polymethyl methacrylate dissolved in methyl methacrylate works as a thixotropic agent, other known and unknown substances such as, for example, fumed silica can be used.<br><br><br>
The anti abrasives can be particulate material of the mineral or metal type of particle size predominately in the 0.03 to 0.8 mm range and the total content of the anti abrasives should not exceed 80 per cent of the aggregate. Thus, it is possible to achieve a substantial improvement over the prior art aggregate by choosing the composition of an article of the kind such that the majority of the mineral or metal anti abrasives particles have a size preferably, of between approximately 0.03 mm and approximately 1.2 mm, that the anti abrasives constitutes less than 80% by weight, of the aggregate compound, and in the areas of the article subject to severe stress during use, the packing density of the anti abrasives particles, i.e., the anti abrasives proportion of the aggregate is greater on the working surface of the article.<br>
A proportion of the anti abrasive particles are silanized by any known silanization process. Silanization is a process which involves the chemical conversion of the hydroxyl groups, which often act as adsorption sites on silica or glass stationary phases, with silane coupling agents to give the inactive -O-SiR.3 grouping. Silanization neutralizes surface charges, eliminating non-specific binding. The broken particles have irregular peripheral edges some of which are sharp. This increases the surface area of the particles effectively and at the same time increases the bond between the particles and the resin matrix. Silanization however dulls the particle surface and therefore for<br><br><br>
the natural look and feel certain number of the particles need to be unsilanized and unbroken.<br>
Viscosity of the mixture to be introduced into the mold depends on the ambient temperature and syrup ingredients. It is preferred that the anti abrasives particles settle towards the bottom wall of the mold cavity. The mold cavity may be cooled to approximately 20 to 25 degrees C whilst introducing the mixture so that it remains thixotropic before and while it is introduced, but, at the same time, permits the anti abrasives particles to settle in the mould before curing since the viscosity decreases as a result of the temperature. Once the polymerization process starts, the level of viscosity increases drastically, thus terminating the sedimentation of the anti abrasives.<br>
The anti abrasive particles may be advantageously river sand coloured or uncoloured, sea sand, emery, carborandum, powdered agate, zirconium sands, metal powders including alumina powder, copper and brass powders or other precious, semi precious and non precious metals and naturally occurring crystalline material in particulate form.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention it is desirable that the anti abrasives particles follow a grading curve with the majority of the anti abrasives particles having a<br><br><br>
size of between approximately 0.03 mm and approximately 1.2 mm and still advantageously, between 0.3 and 0.7mm.<br>
In use, articles according to the invention in which the resin base consists of polymethyl methacrylate are advantageous; however, polyesters, polyurethanes and epoxy resins are also useable.<br>
Advantageously, in the aggregate for making a molded article, filler particles may be included in predetermined proportions to achieve different effects. Such fillers are selected from a group comprising Inorganic particles of : Al(OH)3 Antimony Trioxide, Magnesium carbonate,Metal powders, such as of aluminium, Bronze, Copper, Silver,; Calcium carbonate, Slate, Zircon, Agate, Vermiculite, Granite, Nanoclay, Marble, Wallastonite, Limestone, Bentonite, Gypsum, Mica, and/or ORGANIC particles such as Nylon fibres, carbon/graphite fibres, polyester fibres, Jute Fibers, Woven Woven-polypropylene, Kevlar, PVDF, Banana fiber, Coconut fiber, Vegetable fiber, GLASS FILLERS: Fiber glass, Solid glass spheres, Hollow glass spheres, Glass flakes, and OTHERS: Wood flour/granules, Flyash, and Lignite in the range of 1 to 5% by mass of the aggregate.<br>
Articles made from the novel aggregate envisaged in accordance with this invention have the following among other advantages:<br><br><br>
The articles are less Brittle and less Porous. The scale deposition is less due to less porosity and decreased roughness. Scale formed is easily removed. Vertical walls are smooth and shining which gives excellent appearance and scale deposition is not there. Because of less density of base, weight of article is less and so transport cost will be less and packing cost will be low. Further, breakage during transport will be low on rough roads due to wt. impact on bottom of article as well as because of the fact that cantilever action decreases causing less breakage. The tensile strength is more and further chances of damage to tap hole area while tapping are decreased, There is more resin in the socket, so better griping of clamping screw in socket. There is more elasticity, hence even when bending is there then installation is easy, because straightening by tightening clamps is easy due to more elasticity. Due to high content of resin, bonding with solid particles is good. The surface being more smooth penetration of food, dirt particles will be less. Screwing of clamp is less time consuming and life of drill bit and screw bit (tools for clamp screwing) is increased. The over all product is more hygienic. lUias been proposed that by addition of a bioactive quantities of an antifungal agent such as griseofulvin it is possible to prevent the growth of fungii and other cultures on the articles made from this aggregate.<br>
Pressure vessel cleaning is easy since resin is more and its viscosity is also high. The wearing of mold is less as compared to existing process, since higher resin percentage develop less<br><br><br>
scratches. And so polishing frequency of mold is decreased. Operating range of viscosity is more under tropical conditions. Machining tool life e.g. Edge cutting tool, waste hole drilling tool overflow drilling tool will be more in the article according to this invention due to higher resin content. Article made from the aggregate in accordance with this invention can be cleaned easily.<br>
Following defect are decreased in the article in manufacturing: (a) Pin holes(b) Pitting (c )white patch marks (d) Flow marks, Hence rework and rejection due to above defects will decrease<br>
The articles made according to the invention virtually never get stained during use when they come into contact with dyes, fats or oils, alkaline solutions, acids and the like. Moreover, no so-called water whitening effect occurs, even in the case of alternating exposure to hot and cold water. This feature, in addition to the fact that the articles according to the invention almost never get stained, applies even in those cases where the resin layer coating the anti abrasives particles close to the surface has been partially or completely removed by abrasion on the working surface area.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying examples:<br><br><br>
Example 1<br>
First syrup preparation was done as follows:<br>
In a mixing vessel of Stainless Steel 304 capacity 80 lit. 35.25<br>
kg of MMA was taken.  Then 13.70 kgs of PMMA was added<br>
gradually in 15minutes. The temperature was maintained at 30-<br>
35°C by circulating cooling water in jacket.   Through mixing<br>
was done to dissolve PMMA.   The Speed of the mixture was<br>
maintained at 70 rpm. Total mixing time was 6 hrs.<br>
After mixing temperature was maintained at 20-25°C circulating chilled water in jacket. Then 0.975 kgs of cross-linking agent was added to above syrup and stirred at 70 rpm for lhr. Temperature was continuously maintained at 20.25°C. Then internal demolding agent 0.075 kg of stearic acid was added. It was mixed for Hr. in above syrup at 70-rpm speed. Temperature was maintained at 20-25°C.<br>
Then 35.399 kgs matrix batch was prepared as follows for making the aggregate 11.795 kgs of above syrup with cross linking and demolding / lubricating agent was taken in pressure vessel provided with stirrer for mixing and jacket for maintaining temperature at 15-20°C by circulating chilled water. Capacity of pressure vessel was 60 lit. 0.4 kgs. Of peroxides, was added in the pressure vessel and mixed with syrup for 10 min. at 70 rpm. Speed of stirrer. 23.404 kgs of mixed anti abrasive particles of different colors with 95% particle size between 0.06 mm. to 0.8 mm. was added gradually<br><br><br>
in 10 min. Through the hopper. The speed of stirring while addition of anti abrasives was maintained at 70 rpm. Thereafter it was increased to 140 rpm. Then 0.35 kgs of quartz powder (240 mesh) were added. Then for thorough mixing speed was maintained for 10 min. The above aggregate thus prepared was then used for casting product as follows:<br>
Preparation of Mold: Mold was first cleaned by blowing air. Then top mold was brought down hydrostatically and allowed to rest on bottom mold. Top and bottom molds were hold together by clamps operated pneumatically. Thickness clamps were applied to maintain thickness of molded article. Thickness setting clamps were applied only after applying pressure (4kg/cm2) from bottom to bottom mold since top mold is held firm with bottom mold. The pressure causes bottom mold to rise and then when desired thickness is achieved the thickness clamps are applied for maintaining this thickness. After thickness-setting clamps are applied the pressure from bottom is released.<br>
Molding operation: Pressure vessel with the aggregate was taken to the casting bag. It was then connected to the mold with flexible pipe. The mold was then titled vertically. Then air pressure of 8 kg/cm2 was applied in pressure vessel for transferring the aggregate to mold. When the mold was being filled with aggregate air came out from venting valve / outlet valve of mold. The moment aggregate started flowing out from<br><br><br>
venting / outlet valve, the inlet and outlet valves of mold were closed. Also the outlet valve of pressure vessel was closed. Air supply to pressure vessel was stopped. And mold was tilted back to horizontal position. The air connection to pressure vessel was disconnected, and also flexible pipe connected to mold and pressure vessel disconnected. While filling the mold the temperature of top mold was 20°C and bottom mold was 30°C. Then following temperature cycle was maintained in top and bottom mold through control panel. This temperature cycle was preset in control panel for maintaining temperature in top and bottom molds as desired.<br>

On completion of temp cycle air pressure applied at bottom of mold was released. Then mold clamps were opened. And top air ejector was applied to released top mold sticking to molded article. Top mold was then lifted and bottom air ejectors were applied to lift molded article from mold. Slight hammering with plastic hammer was done on material above ejector points. During demolding temperature of bottom mold was kept of 80°C.<br>
After demolding the molded article was put on fixture where pressure was applied through a clamp. Reverse bending was maintained till the molded article cooled to room temperature.<br>
Machining operation were carried out on this molded article next day. First the waste hole drilling was done on drill machine with diamond tools. Then the side flashes were removed. For this the molded article was clamped on flat wooden fixture and then machined on router machine with help of diamond cutting tool. Drilling and clamping of nylon clamps on socket of molded article was then done.<br>
Example 2<br>
First syrup preparation was done as follows: In a mixing vessel of Stainless Steel 304 capacity 80 lit. 34.22 kg of MMA was taken. Then 18.43 kgs of PMMA was added gradually in 15 minutes.   The temperature was maintained at<br><br><br>
30-35 C by circulating cooling water in jacket. Thorough mixing was done to dissolve PMMA. The Speed of the mixture was maintained at 70 rpm. Total mixing time was 6 hrs.<br>
After mixing temperature was maintained at 20-25°C circulating chilled water in jacket. Then 0.8 kgs of cross-linking agent was added to above syrup and stirred at 70 rpm for lhr. Temperature was continuously maintained at 20.25°C. Then internal demolding agent 0.1 kg of stearic acid was added. It was mixed for 1 Hr. in above syrup at 70-rpm speed. Temperature was maintained at 20-25°C.<br>
Then 35.399 kgs matrix batch was prepared as follows for making the aggregate 11.795 kgs of above syrup with cross linking and demolding / lubricating agent was taken in pressure vessel provided with stirrer for mixing and jacket for maintaining temperature at 15-20°C by circulating chilled water. Capacity of pressure vessel was 60 lit. 0.4 kgs. of peroxides, was added in the pressure vessel and mixed with syrup for 10 min. at 30 rpm. Speed of stirrer. 22.0 kgs of mixed anti abrasive particles of different colors with 95% particle size between 0.063 mm. to 0.8 mm. was added gradually in 10 min. through the hopper. The speed of stirring while addition of anti abrasives was maintained at 70 rpm. Thereafter it was increased to 140 rpm. Then 0.5 kgs of powder silica(240 mesh) and 0.3 kgs of fumed silica was added. Then for through mixing<br><br><br>
speed was maintained for 10 min. The above aggregate thus prepared was then used for casting product as follows :<br>
Preparation of Mold: Mold was first cleaned by blowing air. Then top mold was brought down hydrostatically and allowed to rest on bottom mold. Top and bottom molds were hold together by clamps operated pneumatically. Thickness clamps were applied to maintain thickness of molded article. Thickness setting clamps were applied only after applying pressure (4kg/cm2) from bottom to bottom mold since top mold is held firm with bottom mold. The pressure causes bottom mold to rise and then when desired thickness is achieved the thickness clamps are applied for maintaining this thickness. After thickness setting clamps were applied the pressure from bottom was released.<br>
Molding operation : Pressure vessel with the aggregate was taken to the casting bag. It was then connected to the mold with flexible pipe. The mold was then titled vertically. Then air pressure of 6 kg/cm2 was applied in pressure vessel for transferring the aggregate to mold. When the mold was being filled with aggregate air came out from venting valve / outlet valve of mold. The moment aggregate started flowing out from venting / outlet valve, the inlet and outlet valves of mold were closed. Also the outlet valve of pressure vessel was closed. Air supply to pressure vessel was stopped. And mold was tilted back to horizontal position.   The air connection to<br><br><br>
pressure vessel was disconnected, and also flexible pipe connected to mold and pressure vessel disconnected. While filling the mold the temperature of top mold was 20°C and bottom mold was 30°C. Then following temperature cycle was maintained in top and bottom mold through control panel. This temperature cycle was preset in control panel for maintaining temperature in top and bottom molds as desired.<br>
