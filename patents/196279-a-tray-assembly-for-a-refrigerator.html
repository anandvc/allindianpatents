				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly to a tray assembly for a refrigerator.<br><br>
Generally, a refrigerator is a household electric appliance for storing foodstuffs freshly and is divided into a freezing compartment and a refrigerating compartment. The freezing compartment stores the foodstuffs to be frozen such as meats and the refrigerating compartment stores the foodstuffs at a lower temperature.<br>
Generally, the refrigerator is provided with a tray for efficiently utilizing a space in the refrigerating compartment, and for allowing the user to easily take out foodstuffs.<br>
The tray can be inserted into and withdrawn from the refrigerating compartment.<br>
And, the tray is designed in such a manner that cold air can be circulated in the refrigerating compartment and a liquid formed in the upper portion of the  refrigerating compartment is guided to a lower portion of refrigerating compartment through a draining passage of the tray.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional tray assembly for a refrigerator 300 which is disclosed in a U.S. Patent No.380,279 issued to James F. Dasher, and entitled "Pull-Out Freezer Floor For Refrigerator And Freezers".<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the tray assembly 100 is provided with a base 110 which is installed on an upper surface of a bottom wall of a refrigerating compartment , a tray<br><br>
120 which is slidably mounted on an upper portion of the base 110, and a plurality of rollers 130 which are interposed between the base 110 and the tray 120.<br>
The base 110 is fixed to an upper portion of the bottom wall of the freezing compartment by a fixing means(not shown) such as a bolt, and a roller receptacle(not shown) into which the plurality of rollers 130 are installed is formed on the base 110. A plurality of roller guides(not shown) are formed on the base 110 in the longitudinal direction for allowing the tray 120 to be guided in a predetermined direction.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, the tray 120 has a handle 180 at a front portion thereof for allowing the user to easily insert and withdraw the tray 120. The tray 120 is provided with a wall 190 at both sides thereof in order to easily store foodstuffs and in order to prevent foodstuffs from dropping from the tray 120 while the tray 120 is being inserted and withdrawn. The tray 120 has through regions 200 on both front ends thereof for draining a defrosted liquid or impuritier.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of the tray 120 and the base 110. Each of the roller guides which is formed on the base 110 is spaced apart from each other by a predetermined interval so as to facillate inspection and withdrawl of the tray 120 and so as to properly disperse a weight of the tray 120.<br>
Roller channels 220 are provided at a lower portion of the tray 120, and the number of roller channels 220 is the same as the number of roller guides which are formed on the base 110. Taps 172, which are protruded in the downward direction of the tray 120, are provided at a back end of the roller channels 220, and the taps 172 are inserted into the plurality of the roller guides 110. The roller channels 220 coupled to an inside of the roller guides are slidably moved on the roller guides. A rotatable vertical roller 130 makes contact with an inside of the roller channels 220 which are mounted on<br><br>
a lower portion of the tray 120 so that the tray 120 can be slidably inserted and withdrawn with respect to the base 110.<br>
However, in the conventional tray assembly 100 for a refrigerator, since the tray assembly 100 is shaken in the left and right directions while the tray assembly 100 is being inserted and withdrawn, it is very difficult to insert and withdraw the tray 120 smoothly. Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is contrived to solve the foregoing problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a tray assembly for a refrigerator capable of allowing the user to easily insert and withdraw the tray, and of preventing the tray from shaking in the left and right directions while the tray is being inserted into or withdrawn from the refrigerating compartment.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a tray assembly for a refrigerator comprising: a tray slidably coupled to a pair of guide members which are installed at both side walls of a refrigerating compartment; a first means for allowing said tray to be easily inserted into and withdrawn from said refrigerating compartment, and being mounted on rear ends of both end portions of an underside of said tray; and a second means for allowing said tray to be easily inserted into and withdrawn from said refrigerating compartment and for preventing said tray from shaking in the left and right directions while said tray is being inserted into or withdrawn from said refrigerating compartment, and being mounted on front ends of both side surfaces of an underside of said tray, wherein said tray has a panel on which foodstuffs are placed and an outer frame provided around a brink of said panel for encompassing said panel, said outer frame being formed at both rear end portions of an underside of said outer frame with a pair of grooves, said outer frame being formed at front end portions of both sides of said outer frame with recesses, the first means being installed in the pairs of grooves, the second means being installed in the recesses.<br><br>

The first means further comprises an E-ring which is coupled to an end part of the rotating pin for preventing the rotating pin from separting from the vertical roller.<br>
The outer frame is provided with a pair of the recesses in front of the vertical roller, and each of the recesses is provided with a first and second coupling pins which are downwardly protruded for supporting the second members. The first coupling pin is spaced apart from the second coupling pin by a predetermined interval. The second means includes upper and lower plates which are coupled to the first and second coupling pins. A moving bar is inserted into the second coupling pin, is disposed between the upper and lower plates and is provided at a free end portion thereof with a supporting shaft which is protruded in the upward direction.<br>
A horizontal roller is rotatably coupled to the supporting shaft of the moving bar and a spring is placed between the moving bar and the upper plate. The spring pushes the moving bar toward an inner wall of the refrigerating compartment so that the horizontal roller rotatably makes contact with the inner wall of the refrigerating compartment. The free end portion of the moving bar is downwardly stepped and the supporting shaft has a length larger than a width of the horizontal roller.<br><br>
The first coupling pin and the second coupling pin are respectably inserted into holes formed at both end portions of the upper and lower plates, and a bush for keeping a distance between the upper and lower plate is provided at a position between the upper and lower plates which corresponds to a position of the first coupling pin. The spring includes a torsion spring having a first leg part, a second leg part and on annular ring part which is formed between the first leg part and the second leg part, and the first leg part of the spring makes contact with a supporting shaft of the moving bar so that the moving bar is forced toward the inner wall of the refrigerating compartment. The second leg part is fixedly supported by the bush. The second means further comprises a pair of E-rings which are coupled to end portions of the first and second coupling pins for preventing the second means from separating from the first and second coupling pins.<br>
