DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0030] The waste compositions comprise numerous compounds, waste sources and materials that are treatable by aerobic remediation with various microorganisms in an aqueous environment with an oxygen source such as aii-.' Anaerobic remediation is not part of the present invention. Waste compositions generally include industrial, residential, commercial, sewage, corrosive compounds, and the like.<br>
[0031] The method and apparatus according to the present invention eliminates carbonaceous compounds, odors, noxious compounds, toxic compounds, compounds containing ammonia, ammonium, NO2, NO3, H2S, bio-sludge, natural sources such as algae, and the like.  More specifically,<br>
8<br>
 <br>
examples of industrial waste include hydrocarbons such as hexane,<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like, and alcohols such as ethanol,<br>
methanol, phenol, and the like, and nitrogen-containing chemicals such as<br>
ammonia, aniline, morphiline, and the like as well as waste from<br>
restaurants and food service operations that generally produce large<br>
amounts of fats, oils, and grease. Such compounds have and can block<br>
sewers, pipelines and the like. Examples of residential waste include<br>
dissolved sugar sources, waste food, fats, grease and oil, and the like and<br>
dissolved proteins, starches, and of course human excrement. Examples of<br>
commercial waste include dissolved sugar sources, waste food, fats, grease<br>
and oil and the like and dissolved proteins, starches and the like, as well as<br>
excrement from animals, for example, cows, horses, pigs, chickens, and the<br>
like. Examples of sewage include waste from any industrial, residential, and<br>
commercial sources that are of course piped to a municipal treating plant.<br>
Examples of corrosive compounds include sulfur-containing compounds<br>
such as H2S and the like, and carbonate-containing compounds such as<br>
lime and soda and the like, nitrate-containing compounds such as vinegar,<br>
fertilizer and the like, food sources such as vinegar and the like, and<br>
chloride-containing compounds such as table salt and the like.	^<br>
[0032] The microorganisms that are utilized in the bio-remediation of the above wastes generally work through several different mechanisms such as eradication, reaction therewith, fonnation of complexes, splitting of molecules, fonnation of new compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, sulfur dioxide, nitrites, nitrates, and nitrogen and the like. As noted above, preferably numerous and different types of microorganisms are utilized in the reactor so that a highly diverse microbial population exists to effectively treat most, and even all of the various types of the waste components found in the aqueous waste composition. Desirably, microorganisms are utilized that are found in nature such as in the soil, trees, ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, grains, plants, mold, spores, fungi, and the like. Microorganisms are generally defined as being cellular and being able to replicate without a host cell.   One desired source of microorganisms are the various bacteria that<br>
9<br>
 <br>
are known to remediate various waste compositions. The different types of bacteria are numerous and known to the art and to the literature and thus include bacteria to biodegrade carbonaceous compounds such as pseudomonas species such as Pseudomonas vesicularis, Pseudomonas putida and Aeromonas hydrophila, Brevibacterium acetylicum, bacteria to biodegrade nitrogen-containing compounds such as Nitrobacter species such as Nitrobacter winogradskyi and Nitmsomonas species such as Nitrosomonas europaea and bacteria to biodegrade sulphur-contining compounds such as Thiobacillus species such as Thiobacillus denitrificans and the like. Other microorganisms include various fungi such as those that naturally exist in mushrooms, yeasts, and molds. Generally they lack chlorophyll, have a cell wall composed of polysaccarides, sometimes polypeptides, and chitin, and reproduce either sexually or asexually. Protozoa are simple microorganisms consisting of unicellular organisms that range in size from sub-microscopic to macroscopic. Types of protozoa include sarcomastigophora, labyrinthomorpha, apicomplexa, microspora, acetospora, myxozoa, and ciliophora. Preferably at least two or three, and even four or more different types of microorganism exist within the same bio-remediation stage of the apparatus of the present invention inasmuch as the same has been found to destroy, eradicate, eliminate, react with, the various carbonaceous compounds, various nitrogen containing compounds, various sulfur containing compounds, various toxic compounds, and the like.<br>
[0033] In order to be effective, the various microorganisms have to be attached, contained, captured, bound, etc., by various substrates so that theyare not washed away by the flow of the aqueous waste composition as it flows through a treating apparatus such as a reactor. In order to yield effective and efficient results, the packing substrates of the present invention have various desirable attributes. An Important attribute is a high average surface area such as from at least about 100 square meters per cubic meter (M^/M^^ and desirably at least about 500 M^/M^to about 1.000 M^/M^ and even 200,000 M^/M^ where M^ is the surface area and M^ is the volume.   A more desirable range of the one or more high surface area<br>
10<br>
 <br>
packing substrates is from about 500 M^/IV!^ or 800 M^/IVI^ to about 10,000 M^/M^. At least one, and desirably a plurality of the bio-remediation stages contain two or three, or even four or more different types of packing substrates therein.<br>
[0034] Another important attribute is that the substrate be porous and have a large number of pores therein. The average size of the pores are desirably small but sufficiently large enough to house one or more microorganisms including a colony of various microorganisms. The average pore size can vary over a wide range such as from at least about 1 micron to about 150 microns, or up to about 250 microns, and even up to about 500 microns, ^ore desirable pore sizes range from about 4, or about 20, or about 30, or about 50 microns to about 75 microns or about 100 microns. The pores desirably exist not only on the surface of the substrate, but also in the interior thereof and entirely therethrough such that the substrate often has an "open pore structure".<br>
[0035] As indicated above, another important attribute is that multiple microorganism, e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. be applied, attached, fixed, etc., to th^ packing substrate. Such binding can occur in a number of ways, modes, or surface characteristics such as physically or physico-chemicaliy. Physical attachment can occur by the substrate having a rough surface to help mechanically secure the microorganisms thereto. Physico-chemical attachment can occur through dipolar interaction of the microorganisms to a substrate such as Vanderwalls forces and the like. Physico-chemical attachment can also occur through a cation or an anion microorganism portion respectively with an anionic or a cationic portion of the substrate attachment can also occur through polar or non-polar bonding. Similarly, ionic or non-ionic portions of the microorganism can be attached via ionic or non-ionic bonding. Silica (Si02) provides anionic surface characteristics while alumina (AI2O3) provides cationic surface characteristic. Ion exchange resins (cation, anion) can also be used to immobilize a variety of microorganisms   utilizing   anionic   and   cationic   attractions.   Similarly,<br>
11<br>
 <br>
hydrophobic portions of the microorganism can be attached to hydrophobic portion of the substrate or via a hydrophilic-hydrophilic alignment, etc. While polyethylene and Teflon provide hydrophobic surface characteristics acrylic polymer provides hydrophilic surface characteristics. The above attachment of the microorganisms to the porous substrates is such that the microorganisms are maintained in place throughout the bio-remediation process.<br>
[0036] An important aspect of the present invention is that multiple and generally numerous different types of porous substrates are utilized within a single reactor. Substrates generally include minerals, carbon substrates, ceramic, metal substrates, polymers or plastics, and the like. Examples of various minerals include clay, diatomaceous earth, fuller's earth, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, chromium oxide, zinc oxide, magnesia, boria, boron nitride, pumice, lava, including crushed lava, celite, slag, and the like. Examples of carbon substrates include charcoal, coal, pyrolized wood or wood chips, activated carbon and the like. Ceramics are generally silicates, alumina, mullite, and include brick, tile, terra cotta, porcelain, glasses of all types such as sodium glass and boron glass, porcelain enamels, refractories such as alumina, silicone carbide, boron carbide, and the like. Metal substrates include iron, nickel, cobalt, zinc, aluminum, and the like.<br>
[0037] Polymers or plastics constitute another class of porous packing substrates and include homopolymers, copolymers, graph copolymers, and the like such as polystyrene or copolymers of styrene and/or a-methyl styrene and acrylonitrile, and copolymers of styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN), terpolymers of styrene, acrylonitrile and diene rubber (ABS), copolymers of styrene/acrylonitrile modified with acrylate elastomers (ASA), copolymers of styrene/acrylonitrile modified with ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM) rubber (ASE), and copolymers of styrene and maleic. anhydride (SMA); polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene; chlorinated polyvinyl chlorides (CPVC); polycarbonates (PC); thermoplastic polyesters (TPES)    including    polybutylene    terephthalate    (PBT),    polyethylene<br>
12<br>
 <br>
terephthalate (PET), and aromatic polyesters; polyether-ester segmented copolymers, such as Hytrel* by DuPont Corp.; polyurethanes (PUR); miscible blends of polystyrenes and polyphenylene oxides (PPO), commercially available as Norel from General Electric Company; polyacetals (POM); polymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylic esters, and methacrylic esters; polyamide-imides; polyacrylonitriles; polyarylsulfones; polyester-carbonates; polyether-imides; polyether-ketones (PEK); polyether-ether-ketones (PEEK); polyalphaether ketones (PAEK); polyether sulfones; polyphenylene sulfides; polysulfones; polyethylenes; mixtures of polyethylenes and polypropylenes; nylons; anionic and cationic exchange resins, combinations of any of these polymers as well as recycled mixed plastics and the like.<br>
[0038] The pH of the packing substrate can be important and can range from about 4 to about 10 and preferably from about 6.0 to about 8.<br>
[0039] In order to achieve efficient and thorough bio-remediation of aqueous waste compositions, it is important that the above-noted aspects of the present invention be incorporated within the reactors. Moreover, it is a&gt;i additional important aspect that the packing substrates be of a size, shape, and type so that it aids in dissolving a high amount of oxygen into the water such as at least an average of about 1 part by weight, desirably at least about 2 parts by weight, preferably from about 3 to about 8 parts by weight per million parts by weight of waste water.<br>
[0040] With respect to the overall reactor design, the individual reactors can have various shapes and forms but desirably are elongated as in the form of a column or tower containing the packing substrate therein with the pores thereof containing multiple types of microorganisms. A variety of microorganisms in liquid form or dry form are obtained from commercial sources as well as natural sources are added either before or immediately after inserting into the treatment area. Microorganisms are also added into wastewater periodically when needed. The waste compositions contained in<br>
13<br>
 <br>
an aqueous environment are generally added near the bottom of the reactor with air generally being pumped in at the bottom of the reactor. The addition of air under slight pressure will naturally rise through the reactor and encounter the aqueous wastewater composition and cause the same to rise. The air-wastewater composition then encounters various stages of the reactor containing multiple types of packing substrate containing multiple types of microorganisms in the pores thereof. As note above, since high oxygen content is necessary for efficient operation of the reactor, packing substrates are chosen that provide good mixing of the air with water and thereby fuse the air into smaller bubbles and dissolve some of the oxygen within the water. Thus, substrates are chosen that form a tight packing with one another and have a high packing fraction, i.e. high volume, e.g. overall or exterior volume, of the substrates to the overall interior volume of at least one and preferably all of the bio-remediation stages of the reactor such as at least about 10%, desirably at least about 50%, and preferably about at least 95% by volume. High packing fraction also generally prevents the formation of channels that permit air to channel through the reactor and avoid good mixing. During the course of treatment of the aqueous waste compositions, the dissolved oxygen will aid or react with the microorganism^ to eradicate, attack, react, complex, and othen^/ise transfomfi the waste compositions into odoriess, detoxified, non-hamnful or desired end products.<br>
[0041] Another aspect of the reactors utilized in the present invention is that due to the above-noted parameters, long resident times are generally obtained that permits the microorganisms to bio-remediate or treat the waste compositions in the water. Thus, resident times of from about 2 hours to about 48 hours and generally from about 6 hours to about 24 hours are desired.<br>
[0042] Due to the utilization of one or more air input chambers, the utilization of multiple perforated separators or support trays and hence multiple treatment stages, the utilization of one or more aqueous waste composition feed  inputs,  multiple different types of porous substrates<br>
14<br>
 <br>
containing multiple types of microorganisms, numerous different types of reactors can be utilized. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the following description of different reactors only refer to a few of the possible many different types of reactors.<br>
[0043] Reference is now made to the drawings wherein like names/numerals refer to like parts throughout. Referring to FIG. 1, reactor R can be of any shape having a cross-section thereof that can be square, rectangular, cylindrical, and the like. The reactor contains solid outer walls 11 that are made of a con-osive-free material such as stainless steel and plastics. The reactor generally has a bottom chamber 18 that receives air or oxygen-containing gas under a slight pressure. Air is admitted to the reactor via an air pump, not shown, that supplies air through air supply pipe or conduit 1 and into the top of the reactor through reactor air inlet pipe 5 that is made of a corrosion-resistant material such as stainless steel or plastic. Air inlet pipe 5 is solid except at the bottom portion thereof that has openings or perforations 24 that admits the pressurized ajr into air pressure chamber 18. Air inlet pipe 5 is connected to reactor bottom plate 19 through connection 20 that can be a mechanical fitting, a weld, or the like. When th^ air flows into chamber 18 that generally extends throughout the bottom portion of the reactor, since it is under pressure it is forced through micro-porous difFuser 16 that has tiny openings so that the air is admitted into aqueous waste composition chamber 17 in the form of tiny bubbles. Micro-porous diffusers are known to the art and to the literature and are commercially readily available.<br>
[0044] Reactor R, that contains lift handle 8, can be inserted into any aqueous waste composition environment such as a pond, a holding tank, a sewage enclosure or other confined area. Reactor R can be free standing, that is, simply placed within the aqueous waste composition e.nclosure in which situation ballast can be added to the bottom portion of the reactor. FIG. 2 shows one type of ballast containing a corrosion-resistant bottom 34 have side walls or housing 32 that form an enclosure that contains a ballast<br>
15<br>
 <br>
material 33 such as concrete therein. The optional ballast can be secured to the bottom of reactor R as through bolts 31 or other fastening members. Altematively, reactor R can optionally be attached to a support such as the wall of wastewater treatment tank through holding lug 7.<br>
[0045] The aqueous waste composition is added to the reactor through wastewater inlet 21 that can be in the shape of an elbow having an opening at the other end thereof and optionally can be perforated. When placed in a tank containing an aqueous waste composition therein, the aqueous waste composition will flow into aqueous waste composition chamber 17 wherein it is mixed with air bubbles 10. The aqueous waste composition will be caused taflow upward through the reactor via drag forces due to forced air flow through the perforated air carrier pipe, chimney 9. That is, the concept of the reactor is a bottom input of air as well as the' aqueous waste composition that is then caused to flow upward through various perforated separators 15A, 15B, 15C, etc., that have perforations 13 therein and thus through various stages of the reactor. The size of the various perforated openings in the separators is sufficient to allow air and water to flow therethrough but generally and desirably does not penmit the packing substrates to pass therethrough. Figure 4 shows various substrates with high surface area are placed in perforated air, chimney pipe 9 to create tortuous paths for air bubbles improve dissolving oxygen into wastewater.<br>
[0046] Perforated separator 15A is a diffuser that allows bubbles 10 of air in aqueous waste composition 17 to flow upward therethrough (flow arrows 25) thus providing an additional mixing of the aqueous waste composition and the air bubbles so that some of the oxygen in the air is dissolved into the water.<br>
[0047] As noted above, an important aspect of the present invention is that a plurality of multiple perforated separators exist to create a plurality of bio-remediation stages throughout the reactor such as anywhere from 2 to about 10 and desirably from about 3 to about 5 stages.  The area formed<br>
16<br>
 <br>
between perforated separators 15A, 15B, and 15C, are identified as chamber 15AA, 15BB, 15CC, etc. The chambers 15AA, 15BB, 15CC, etc., are filled with packing substrate 30 that although can be only one type of packing but preferably is a plurality of different packings. That is, while each chamber formed between the various separators may contain only one type of packing, it is highly preferred that a plurality of different types of packings exist within reactor R and that a plurality of different packings also exist within each chamber 15AA, 15BB, 15CC, 15DD, etc.<br>
[0048] In accordance with the above-noted aspects of the present invention, chamber 15AA contains packing substrates that are efficient in mixing th€ air bubbles and water to dissolve the oxygen within the water. Packing substrate 30A in accordance with the aspects of the present invention has high surface area and a high amount of pores having sizes as noted above. Located within packing substrate 30A is at least one type of microorganism with the proviso that the entire reactor R contains a plurality of microorganisms, i.e. at least two and generally several types such as from about 2 to about 300. Numerous microorganisms are utilized so that the reactor is efficient with regard to eradicating, detoxifying, complexing, or othen«/ise treating the various different types of waste contained with the aqueous waste composition and thus produce a very efficient reactor.<br>
[0049] Since bubbles 10 are lighter than the water, they flow upward through chamber 15AA and cause the aqueous waste composition to flow upward so that continuous mixing of the air and the waste composition occurs thereby continuously causing dissolving of some of the oxygen into the water. The upward flow of the aqueous waste composition through the packing substrates 30A causes the dissolved molecular components of the waste composition to eventually contact a microorganism contained within the pores of the substrate whereby the waste composition molecule is bio-remediated. The process of mixing the air bubbles with the aqueous waste stream, the dissolving of oxygen into the water, and the contacting of various    molecular    components    of    the    waste    composition    with<br>
17<br>
 <br>
microorganisms is continuous within each chamber 15AA, chamber 15BB, chamber 15CC, etc. Thus overall, oxygen is dissolved into the water within each chamber and the amount of waste composition from one chamber to the next upper chamber is continuously reduced as the aqueous waste composition proceeds upwardly through the reactor. Because of the tortuous path that must be taken by the waste composition through the various packing beds and the inherent long residence time, the waste composition upon reaching the top of the reactor is essentially depleted of waste components. That is, the aqueous waste composition is purified so that only purified water is admitted from the top of the reactor through perforated top plate 6.<br>
[0050] The various perforated separators 15B, 15C, 15D, can be the same or different than perforated separator 15A. Generally, the substrates contained within each chamber 15AA, 15BB, 15CC, can be different so that the various stages, i.e. chambers 15AA, 15BB, 15CC, etc., treat different components of the aqueous waste composition. Of course, the various chambers, inasmuch as they preferably contain multiple different types of packings, can still contain a packing that is similar or identical to that found in another chamber. With respect to the microorganisms, the same situation generally exists within each chamber. That is, while the entire reactor contains at least two different types of microorganisms, generally a plurality exists within each chamber and the different chambers can contain a plurality of different microorganisms that are different from the preceding or following chamber or contain some common microorganisms. In summary, the described reactor R shown in FIG. 1 constitutes a very efficient bio-remediation apparatus and process.<br>
[0051] An optional but preferable aspect of the reactor of FIG. 1 is that it contains a chimney pipe 9 that has perforations 12 therein. Chimney pipe 9 can be located generally in the center of the reactor such as adjacent to input air pipe 5. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, there are two chimney pipes 9 located on either side of air pipe 5 with the chimney pipes being perforated<br>
18<br>
 <br>
36 at the bottom thereof and also being perforated 36 at the top thereof at perforated top plate 6. Accordingly, air bubbles 10 and the aqueous waste composition can enter the bottom of chimney pipe 9 and flow upward through the pipe. That this upward flow that is not impeded by perforated separators 15A, 15B, 15C, etc., is important to producing continued circulation of the air and aqueous waste composition upward through the various chambers. Moreover, air bubbles within chimney pipe 9 exit therefrom into the various chambers and ensure additional mixing of the air with the aqueous waste composition and more lmpori;antly aid in diffusion of dissolved oxygen into the packed chambers of the apparatus from chimneys within the water.<br>
[0052] FIGS. 3 and 4 relate to side elevation views of chimney 9. The chimney has a plurality of perforations therein generally indicated by reference numeral 12 as being oval shaped. However, the exact shape of perforations 12 can vary so long as it generally is large enough to permit air bubbles and the aqueous waste composition with dissolved oxygen therethrough but to inhibit the passage of packing substrates 30 therethrough, as shown in FIG. 11. The top and bottom of the chimneys contain perforations 36.<br>
[0053] Another reactor of the present invention is shown in FIG. 5 that is very similar to FiG. 1 wherein like numbers represent like parts, and hence the various parts, composition, and process description thereof will not be repeated but rather is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0054] The reactor of FIG. 5 is different from FIG. 1 in that two additional chimney pipes 9 exist that are located laterally of the center chimney pipe 9. The additional chimney pipes are also perforated at their bottom 36 adjacent to separator 15A and at their top 36 adjacent to peri'orated top plate 6 so that air and aqueous waste composition can flow therethrough. As with the embodiment of FIG. 1, the additional chimneys serve to circulate air and aqueous wastewater throughout the various chambers 15AA, 15BB, 15CC,<br>
19<br>
 <br>
etc., to ensure further mixing of the air and water within the chambers and also to promote dissolving oxygen within the water, contact of the waste components with microorganisms, and the like.<br>
[0055] The embodiment of FIG. 6 relates to use of two reactors each contained within a separate tank to treat aqueous waste compositions therein whereby the aqueous composition of the left tank overflows into the composition of the center tank which then overflows into the right-hand tank and then out wastewater output line 3. More specifically, air pump 26 via air supply line 1 supplies air into the reactor of the left-hand tank as well as to the reactor of the center tank. The two tanks, independently, can be the same as the tanks described in FIG. 1 and FIG. 5. The operation of each separate tank is as set forth hereinabove with regard to FIGS. 1 and 5 and thus will not described for purposes of brevity but rather the above description thereof is fully incorporated by reference. Accordingly, each tank, independently, treats the aqueous waste composition within the tank and emits purified wastewater out of the top of the tank. Slowly the affluent within the left hand tank is cleaned and through an overflow pipe, is transfen-ed to the center tank. Inasmuch as untreated aqueous waste composition is added through input pipe 2 to the left-hand tank, equilibrium is eventually reached. The affluent from the left tank that flows into the center tank is treated by the reactor in that tank and once again equilibrium is reached wherein the wastewater of the center tank has been bio-remediated such that the influent thereof Is relatively pure. The affluent from the center tank is then overflowed into the right-hand tank where it can b3 discharged.<br>
[0056] Another reactor embodiment is shown in FIG. 7 that is similar to the reactors shown in FIGS. 1 and 5. Accordingly, a great majority of the parts numbers in FIG. 7 are the same as in FIGS. 1 and 5 apd thus the description of the parts as well as operation of the reactor of FIG. 7 are very similar to that of FIGS. 1 and 5 and hence will not be repeated but rather are hereby fully incorporated by reference with regard to the description as set<br>
20<br>
 <br>
forth in FIGS. 1 and 5. The reactor of FIG. 7 is different than the reactors in FIGS. 1 and 5 in that it does not contain any chimney pipes 9. Rather, sump pumps 29 pump the aqueous waste composition through wastewater inlet pipe 28 and subsequently through reactor inlet pipe 27 into aqueous wastewater composition chamber 17 where it mixes with incoming air bubbles from air pressure chamber 18. The reactor design of FIG. 7 is more efficient than the reactors set forth in FIGS. 1 and 5. Inasmuch as the reactor of FIG. 7 does not contain chimneys, flow of air and aqueous waste composition from chamber 17 will be forced to flow through the packing from charriber 15AA into chamber 15BB and subsequently into chamber 15CC, etc., and thus the residence time is prolonged. Longer residence time allows more air bubbles to be trapped by the packing substrates 30A, 306, 30C, etc., to further enhance the level of dissolved oxygen, therefore bio-remediation. Thus, the effluent admitted from reactor of FIG. 7 is generally pure water.<br>
[0057] FIGS. 8-20 relate to bio-remediation systems that utilize various reactors such as the types set forth in FIGS. 1, 5, and 7. All of the^systems in FIGS. 8-20 contain various types of tanks that contain aqueous wast^ compositions that require remediation. Additional items include air pumps 26, sump pumps 29, optional nutritional and/or chemical feeding pumps 14 or essential nutritional or chemical feeding pump 35, and recirculation pumps 23. As should be apparent to those skilled in the art, the above combination of reactors, tanks, and various pumps result in a large number of systems that can be utilized all according to the present invention. For purpbses of brevity, since the description of the various reactors have been described hereinabove, the components, operation and process thereof will not be repeated but rather is hereby fully incorporated by reference. As also should be apparent to those skilled in the art, FIGS. 8-20 relating to different bio-remediation systems can generally be described as flow digrams that teach various combinations of the above-noted items of the present invention. Hence, a brief description of the various figures will be set forth. Such bio-remediation systems can generally be utilized in a large number of<br>
21<br>
 <br>
different applications sucli as industrial, commercial, municipal, and the like as noted hereinabove. Desirably the embodiments of FIGS. 6 and 8-15 can be used for septic tanks, grease interceptors, in lagoons, and ponds. The system set forth in FIG. 16 and 17 can be used to treat industrial wastewaters whereas the embodiments set forth in FIGS. 18-21 are well suited for use in wastewater treatment plant aeration basins, pump stations, lagoons, and ponds.<br>
[0056] FIG. 8 relates to a treatment system very similar to FIG. 6 except that the reactors of FIG. 8 are those as set forth in FIG. 7, that is, i.e. no chimneys. Accordingly, air pump 26 pumps air through air line 1 into the left reactor and the center reactor of FIG. 8. Both the left tank and the center tank of FIG. 8 contain sump pumps 29 therein that force the aqueous waste composition fluid through pipeline 28 and through reactor inlet pipe 27 into the bottom of the reactor. Bio-remediation thus occurs as described in FIG. 7 and thus will not be repeated but rather is hereby fully incorporated by reference. As with FIG. 6, the aqueous waste composition such as fats, oils, or greases as from a restaurant is pumped into the left tank wherein it is bio-remediated by the FIG, 7-type reactor. A portion of the treated aqueous waste composition of the left tank then overflows into the center tank of FIG. 8 wherein it is further bio-remediated by the reactor therein. Subsequently, a continuous amount of overflow of the treated aqueous waste composition of the center tank overflows into the right-hand tank wherein it can be further treated or not treated and is subsequently passed through outlet wastewater line 3. An optional aspect of FIG. 8 as well as FIG: 6 is that a nutrient and/or chemical pump 14 can be utilized to pump various nutrients into the left-hand tank such as sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate solution to adjust alkalinity for nitrifiers to oxidize ammonia-containing substances to nitrite and nitrate so that nitrification and denitrification can be achieved. Alternatively, pump 14 can be utilized to supply various chemicals to the tank to further treat the waste compositions therein.<br>
22<br>
 <br>
[0059] Referring to FIG. 9, the system thereof is similar to FIG. 8 except that instead of utilizing sump pumps 29 located within the tank, a portion of the aqueous waste composition in each tank is withdrawn from the tank and recirculated through external recirculation pump 23 and then to the bottom of the FIG. 7-type reactor.<br>
[0060] Similar bio-remediation systems are shown in FIGS. 10, 11, and 12. As apparent from the flow diagrams, an aqueous waste composition is withdrawn from the tank by recirculation pump 23 and is fed via inlet pipe 28 to reactor Inlet pipe 27 wherein it is bio-remediated. The reactor is of the type set forth in FIGS. 1 or 5 inasmuch as air is pumped into the reactor with the treated or bio-remediated waste composition being recirculated back into the tank via line 4. Optionally, nutrient or chemical compounds can be added to the reactor via pump 14. The system of FIG. 11 is similar to FIG.<br>
10	except that additionally the tank contains a reactor of the type set forth in either FIGS. 1 or 5 and thus has an air pump 26 that feeds air via line 1 into the reactor. The bio-remediation system of FIG. 12 is similar to that of FIG.<br>
11	except that sump pump 29 is utilized to pump the aqueous waste composition in the tank via pipe line 28 into the reactor inlet pipe 27.	"^<br>
[0061] The bio-remediation embodiments of FIGS. 13-15 are similar. In FIG. 13, aqueous waste compositions are withdrawn from the tank and via recirculation pump 23 are fed to a first reactor and after bio-remediation therein, the effluent waste composition is fed to the bottom of a second reactor. Both reactors are air fed. Thus, both reactors are of a type set forth-in FIGS. 1 and 5. The treated waste composition is then transferred from the second tank via water retum line 4 to the tank. The process continues until all the waste composition in the tank has been treated so that the remaining water meets acceptable government regulations, etc. An optional aspect of each FIGS. 13-15 is the utilization of a nutrient and/or chemical pump 14 to pump such compounds into the bottom of the first tank. The system of FIG. 14 is similar to that of FIG. 13 except that additionally, it contains an air pump type reactor as described in FIGS. 1<br>
23<br>
 <br>
and 5 wherein through air pump 26 and feed line 1 the air is admitted to the reactor that is located within the tank. The embodiment of system of FIG. 15 is similar to that of FIG. 14 except that sump pump 29 is utilized to pump the waste composition through feed pipe 28 into the reactor inlet pipe 27. The remediation system of FIGS. 16 and 17 are similar to FIGS. 13 and 15, respectively, except that instead of recycling the treated waste composition from the second reactor back to the tank, it is merely transferred out of the upper portion of the second reactor through outlet pipe 3 to any desired location. This system is proposed for industrial wastewater treatment in which industrial wastewater will contain unusual combinations of chemicals, hydrocarbons requiring special microorganisms to biodegrade. In these systems different types of microorganisms and their mutants can be housed in bottom-fed upward-designed packed column reactor.<br>
[0062] The bio-remediation system of FIGS. 18-21 is similar. In the system of FIG. 18, five reactors are contained in an elongated tank containing an aqueous waste composition. Air pump 26 feeds air into each of the five reactors that are of a type as set forth in either FIGS. 1 or 5. Input of the waste composition is through tank inlet line 2 and the treated aqueous wastewater exits through outlet line 3. Naturally, each of the five reactors draws the aqueous waste composition into the bottom of the reactor and expels purified wastewater through the top of the reactor. Since the flow of the aqueous wastewater composition is from the left to the right of the elongated tank, each successive reactor will further cleanse the wastewater until it is purified at the right side of the tank and expelled through outlet line 3. The bio-remediation system shown in FIG. 20 as apparent from the flow diagram thereof is similar to that of FIG. 18 except that sump pumps are utilized with respect to each reactor to transfer the waste composition into the bottom of the reactor via pipe 28 and Into reactor inlet pipe 27. The bio-remediation system disclosed in FIG. 19 gs apparent from the flow diagram thereof is similar to FIG. 18 except that a portion of the aqueous waste composition is transferred via recirculation pump 23 and pipe line 28 to inlet pipe 27 of a reactor. The reactor has air pumped therein<br>
24<br>
 <br>
via pump 26 and line 1 and thus the reactor is of a type as set forth in either FIGS. 1 or 5. After treatment in the reactor, the treated waste composition is recirculated back into the elongated tank. In this embodiment, once again nutrients or chemicals can be optionally added to the reactor via pump 14. The bio-remediation embodiment shown in FIG. 20 is very similar to that shown in FIG. 19 in that it includes a reactor located outside of the tank. However, in lieu of wastewater flow into the bottom of the reactors located within the tank, sump pumps 29 are utilized to feed the aqueous waste composition via inlet pipe 28 into reactor inlet pipe 27.<br>
[0063] As should be apparent from FIGS. 8-21, numerous different types of bio-remediation systems exist according to the concepts of the present invention utilizing reactors having chimneys or reactors not having chimneys therein in association with various items such as sump pump, air pumps, nutrient pumps, additional reactors, and the like.<br>
[0064] While in accordance with the patent statutes, the best mode and preferred embodiment have been set forth, the scope of the invention is not limited   thereto,   but   rather   by  the   scope   of  the   attached   claims.<br>
