"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN ALICYCLIC DICARBOXYLIC<br>
ACID DIESTER"<br>
NEW JAPAN CHEMICAL CO., LTD., a juridical person under the laws of Japan, of 13, Yoshijima Yagura-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto-shi, Kyoto 612-8224, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
25<br><br>
The present invention relates to an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester suitable as a lubricating oil for a refrigerator and a process for preparing the same.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention concerns with an<br>
alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester prepared by a 2-step process, the ester being useful as a lubricating oil (hereinafter referred to as "refrigerator oil") for compressors in automotive air conditioners, refrigerators, room air conditioners, large-size industrial refrigerators or the like using hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, a process for preparing the same and a refrigerator oil containing the ester.<br>
The term "alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester" used in this specification (and claims xefers to an alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid ""diester wherein the two ester groups thereof are attached to two adjacent carbon atoms of the alicyclic or aromatic<br><br>
group such as cyclohexane, cyclohexene or benzene, the two ester groups being different from each other.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In recent years, an attempt is going on to substitute a refrigerant such as HFC-134a which is a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) for Rll or R12 which is a chloro-fluorocarbon (CFC) or R22 which is a hydrochloro-fluorocarbon (HCFC) to overcome the problems of ozone layer depletion and global warming. Now oxygen-containing synthetic oils have come into use as a refrigerator oil for HFC. Examples are polyol esters (JP-A-3-128991, JP-A-3-200895, etc.), polyvinyl ethers (JP-A-6-128578, etc.) and polyalkylene glycol (JP-A-2-242888, JP-A-3-33193, etc.).<br>
WO 97/21792 discloses that an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester available as a new type of ester has a high hydrolysis stability and can be used as a metal cutting fluid or as a refrigerator oil.      <br>
More recently, however, the critical mind toward global warming has become intensified so that the development of efficient machinery is on the way to save energy in refrigerators for the purpose of reducing the emission level of carbon dioxide which causes global warming. On the other hand, since a CFC substitute<br><br>
itself(CFC and HCFC substitutes), used as a refrigerant, is one of global warming substances, it is desired to decrease the quantity of the refrigerant to be used. To improve the efficiency of machinery and to decrease the refrigerant consumption, a compact machinery may be a candidate for achieving the goals. In compact machinery, however, lubricating oils will be used unavoidably under severer conditions. Therefore, new refrigerator oils need to be improved over conventional oils in hydrolysis stability, heat stability, electrical insulating property, lubricity and the like. Yet new refrigerator oils which can meet these requirements have not been developed. Thus, there is a need for providing an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester which is suitable as a refrigerator oil and which has an improved performance.<br>
Generally a refrigerator oil is selected considering whether it has a viscosity characteristic suitable for a particular apparatus to be used. For example, JIS-K-2211 classifies refrigerator oils into five categories. Thus, various refrigerator oils having different viscosities are necessary for different apparatuses and for different intended uses.<br>
At the moment, polyol ester refrigerator oils are available for practical applications. Viscosity adjustment of such refrigerator oils is carried out by (1) mixing at<br><br>
least 2 kinds of polyol esters of different viscosities or by (2) providing a polyol mixed ester of the desired viscosity in a 1-step process using a mixture of at least two alcohols or acids as the starting materials for esterification, as disclosed, for example, in JP-A-3-200895 and JP-A-4-20597.<br>
WO 97/21792 discloses, as mentioned above, that an alicyclic adjacent dicarboxylic acid ester available as a new type of ester has an excellent hydrolysis stability and can be used as a metal cutting fluid or as a refrigerator oil. JP-A-4-226193 describes an aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid ester has a high performance as a refrigerator oil.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing, a first object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a process for preparing a<br>
«■*...   —__—<br>
dicarboxylic acid diester which is excellent in hydrolysis stability, heat stability, electrical insulating property, lubricity and the like.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors intensively investigated alicyclic dicarboxylic acid esters in an attempt to cope with the need for various viscosity grades of refrigerator oils, and found that when the viscosity<br><br>
adjustment is carried out by mixing at least two alicyclic adjacent dicarboxylic acid esters of different viscosities according to method (1) above, the obtained ester mixture may be inferior in stability, electrical insulating property, lubricity, miscibility with refrigerants, etc. due to the drawbacks of low-viscosity esters or high-viscosity esters. On the other hand, the inventors discovered that alicyclic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diesters can cope with the need for refrigerator oils of various viscosity grades. However, when a mixed diester is prepared by method (2) above, the obtained diester is not satisfactory in stability, electrical insulating property, lubricity and the like when used under recent stricter conditions, because the quality of the mixed diester is low due to low reactivity in esterification.<br>
In this situation, a second object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a mixed diester which, when used as a refrigerator oil, is easily adjustable to a wide range of viscosities and which is excellent in hydrolysis stability, heat stability, electrical insulating property and lubricity.<br>
The present inventors conducted extensive research to<br><br>
achieve the foregoing objects and found that alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diesters or alicyclic or aromatic<br><br>
adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diesters having specific properties are outstanding in hydrolysis stability, heat stability, electrical insulating property, lubricity and the like.<br>

The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diesters represented by the formula (1) may include position isomers ascribed to ester groups. For example, 4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid diester may be an isomer depending on whether two ester groups are present in equatorial or axial positions. Specifically, the diester is a cis isomer when one of its two ester groups is in the equatorial position and the other is present in the axial position. The diester is a trans isomer when both of its two ester groups are present in the equatorial position or in the axial position. Both isomers can be used for use in a refrigerator oil.<br>
When esterification temperature is set to higher than 210° C and upto about 230° C in the preparation of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester, the esterification tends to predominantly give a trans isomer, whereas when esterification temperature is set at about 100 to about 210°C, the esterification tends to predominantly give a cis isomer.<br><br>
A cis-form ester can be isomerized to a trans-form ester. Isomerization can be performed according to the method disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat.5,231,218.<br>

It is recommended that the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid of the formula (2) and its anhydride preferably have a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less. However, the alicyclic dicarboxylic acids are usually solid at room temperature, and therefore increase in peroxide value thereof is relatively small and would affect the performance of the present ester to a lesser degree, when used as a refrigerator lubricating oil, compared with increase in peroxide value of the alcohol of component b) used in the present invention.<br>

The term "carbonyl value" used herein is described in 2.5.4-1996 of Standard Methods for the Analysis of Fats, Oil and Related Materials (Japan Oil Chemists" Society), and refers to a value obtained by causing 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to act on a sample and converting the value of its absorbance at 440 nm to a value per gram of the sample, according to the method described therein.<br>
When an alcohol having a peroxide value of more than 1.0 meq/kg is used, the obtained alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester is adversely affected in the properties such as hue and peroxide value and involve problems in the properties such as electrical insulating property, heat stability and hydrolysis stability.<br>
An alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less can be prepared by purifying an alcohol having a peroxide value of more than 1.0 meq/kg through distillation<br><br>
or through a treatment with a reducing agent to thereby decrease the peroxide value.<br>
Generally an alcohol immediately after distillation has a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less. However, such alcohol may show a peroxide value of more than 1.0 meq/kg due to oxidation during a long-term storage (e.g. storage for 6 months or longer) depending on the storage conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm a peroxide value of the alcohol before esterification.<br>
The purification by distillation can be performed, e.g. by distilling an alcohol having a peroxide value exceeding 1.0 meq/kg at 50-300°C in the presence of an alkali compound under reduced pressure. Useful alkali compounds include, for example, NaOH, KOH, LiOH, etc. It is recommendable to use the alkali compound in an amount of 0.001 to 0.5 wt.% based on the alcohol.<br>
The purification by reduction can be conducted, e.g. by stirring an alcohol having a peroxide value exceeding 1.0 meq/kg at 30-150°C in the presence of a reducing agent for 30 minutes to 5 hours, preferably 1 to 2 hours. Useful reducing agents include, for example, sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, lithium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, etc. It is recommendable to use the reducing agent in an amount of 30 to 10,000 ppm based on the alcohol.<br><br><br>
When an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester is prepared using an alcohol having a carbonyl value of 15 or less, preferably 5 or less, more preferably 1 or less, the obtained ester has excellent hue and reduced peroxide value.<br>
In the case of an alcohol having a carbonyl value of more than 15 as well, its carbonyl value can be decreased to 15 or less by purification through distillation or by purification through reduction, which may be carried out following the procedure of the foregoing method for lowering the peroxide value.<br>
Specific examples of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol to be used as component b) in esterification are branched-chain alcohols of 3 to 18 carbon atoms and straight-chain alcohols of 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples of the alicyclic monohydric alcohol include cycloalcohol of 3 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Especially,<br>
1)	when the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid represented by the formula (2) or an anhydride thereof is used as the acid component, it is preferable to use an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having 1 to 18 carbon atoms or an alicyclic monohydric alcohol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, each having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less, and<br>
2)	when the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid di(C1-C4) lower alkyl diester represented by the formula (3) is used<br><br>
as the acid component, it is preferable to use an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having 5 to 18 carbon atoms or an alicyclic monohydric alcohol having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, each having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less.<br>
More specific examples of the aliphatic monohydric branched-chain alcohol are isopropanol, isobutanol, see-but anol, isopentanol, isohexanol, 2-methylhexanol, 1-methylheptanol, 2-methylheptanol, isoheptanol, 2-ethylhexanol, 2-octanol, isooctanol, isononanol, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanol, 2,6-dimethyl-4-heptanol, isodecanol, isoundecanol, isododecanol, isotridecanol, isotetradecanol, isopentadecanol, isohexadecanol, isoheptadecanol, isooctadecanol, etc.<br>
More specific examples of the aliphatic monohydric straight-chain alcohol are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-heptanol, n-octanol, n-nonanol, n-decanol, n-undecanol, n-dodecanol, n-tridecanol, n-tetradecanol, n-pentadecanol, n-hexadecanol, n-heptadecanol, n-octadecanol, 2-hexenol, 5-hexenol, 2-heptenol, 6-heptenol, 2-octenol, 8-nonenol, 2-decenol, 2-undecenol, 10-undecenol, 11-dodecenol, 12-tridecenol, 2-tetradecenol, 2-pentadecenol, 2-hexadecenol, 15-hexadecenol, 2-heptadecenol, 2-octadecenol, 9-octadecenol, etc.<br>
More specific examples of the alicyclic monohydric cycloalcohol include cyciohexanol, methylcyclohexanoi,<br>
Hf<br><br>
dimethylcyclohexanol, etc.<br>
Among the foregoing alcohols, saturated alcohols of 1 to 18 carbon atoms are preferable to achieve good heat stability. Alcohols of 1 to 11 carbon atoms are desirable to achieve better miscibility with a refrigerant.<br>
The above alcohols can be esterified alone as an alcohol component, or two or more species of alcohol can be used as mixed.<br>
When a mixture of two or more species of the alcohol is used for esterification, the obtained alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester of the formula (1) is a mixed<br>
diester wherein R* and R^ are different. Such mixed diester is suitably used as well.<br>
In esterification, the alcohol component is used in an amount of about 1 to about 1.5 equivalents, preferably about 1.05 to about 1.2 equivalents, per equivalent of carboxylic acid group of component a), i.e., an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid of the formula (2) or an anhydride thereof or an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester of the formula (3).<br>
It is preferred that neither the acid component nor the alcohol component to be used in esterification contain a sulfur element or a phosphorus element as impurities. Catalyst<br>
In the present invention, the esterification reaction<br><br>
is carried out in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of a sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst. It is particularly recommended to carry out the esterificatlon in the presence of a sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst.<br>
The sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst for use in the esterificatlon of the invention is a catalyst which does not contain a sulfur element or a phosphorus element in the constituent elements of the catalyst. Specifically, examples of useful catalysts are Lewis acids and alkali metal compounds which contain neither a sulfur element nor a phosphorus element. More specifically, examples of Lewis acids are aluminum derivatives, tin derivatives, titanium derivatives, lead derivatives and zinc derivatives. Examples of alkali metal compounds are sodium alkoxide, potassium alkoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. These catalysts can be used either alone or in combination. Preferred catalysts are those containing no sulfur element or phosphorus element as impurities.<br>
Of such catalysts, particularly preferred are tetra(C3-C8 alkyl) titanate, titanium oxide, titanium<br>
hydroxide, sodium alkoxide of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, sodium hydroxide, C3-C12 fatty acid tin salt, tin oxide, tin<br>
hydroxide, zinc oxide, zinc hydroxide, lead oxide, lead hydroxide, aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide. The<br><br><br>
amount of the catalyst to be used is, for example, about 0.05 to about 1 wt.% based on the total amount of the acid component (component a) above) and the alcohol component (component b) above) used as the raw materials for synthesis of the ester.<br>
Reaction conditions<br>
The esterification temperature is, for example, in the range of 100 to 230° C. Usually the reaction is completed in 3 to 30 hours.<br>
To accelerate the distillation of water formed by the reaction, a water-entraining agent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane or the like may be used in the esterification.<br>
The esterification reaction may be carried out under atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure (e.g., 133 to 66500 Pa). However, from a viewpoint of accelerating the esterification reaction, it is preferable to combine esterification reaction under atmospheric pressure and esterification reaction under reduced pressure. Particularly, it is recommended to carry out the esterification reaction under reduced pressure in a later stage of the reaction (such as the stage in which the total acid number of the reaction mixture becomes about 10<br><br>
mgKOH/g or less) when the esterification reaction velocity becomes low.<br>
When oxides, peroxides, carbonyl compounds and like oxygen-containing organic compound are produced in esterification reaction due to oxidative deterioration of the raw material, the obtained ester and the organic solvent (water-entraining agent), the hygroscopicity, hydrolysis stability and electrical insulating property would be adversely affected. Consequently, the esterification reaction is preferably carried out in an atmosphere or stream of inert gas such as nitrogen gas.<br>
In the process of the invention for preparing an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester for use as a lubricating oil for refrigerators, a preferable combinations of properties of the aliphatic monohydric alcohol of 1 to 18 carbon atoms or alicyclic monohydric alcohol of 3 to 10 carbon atoms constituting the ester are, for example, as follows:<br>
1)	an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less,<br>
2)	an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less and a carbonyl value of 15 or less,<br>
3)	an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less and a carbonyl value of 5 or less,<br>
4)	an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a peroxide value<br><br>
of 0.5 meq/kg or less and a carbonyl value of 5 or less, and<br>
5) an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a peroxide value of 0.5 meq/kg or less and a carbonyl value of 1 or less.<br>

The cyclohexane adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester can also be prepared by completely hydrogenating the aromatic ring of the aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester of the invention (hydrogenation of nucleus). The cyclohexene adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester can be prepared by partly hydrogenating the aromatic ring of the aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester.<br>
The alicyclic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diesters of the invention include position isomers ascribed to ester groups. For example, 4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid diester may be an isomer depending on whether two ester groups are present in equatorial or axial<br><br>
positions. Specifically, the diester is a cis isomer when one of its two ester groups is in the equatorial position and the other is present in the axial position. The diester is a trans isomer when both of its two ester groups are present in the equatorial position or in the axial position. All of these isomers can be used for use in a refrigerator oil.<br>
When esterification temperature is set to higher than 210" C and up to about 230°C in the second stage esterification for the preparation of the alicyclic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester, the esterification tends to predominantly give a trans isomer, whereas when esterification temperature is set at about 160 to about 210°C, the esterification tends to predominantly give a cis isomer.<br>
A cis-form ester can be isomerized to a trans-form ester. Isomerization can be performed according to the method disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat.5,231,218.<br>
As to the ratio of the isomers, it is desirable that trans isomer/cis isomer ratio is 0/100 to 80/20 (by area % as determined by gas chromatography). More preferably, the trans isomer/cis isomer ratio is 20/80 to 80/20 (by area % as determined by gas chromatography) in view of hydrolysis stability, electrical insulating property and miscibility with a refrigerant. The conditions under which gas<br><br>
chromatography is conducted will be described in Examples.<br>
Process for preparing an ester of embodiment II Step fa^i first-staae esterlfication reaction<br>
The alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic anhydride to be used as the raw material (hereinafter referred to as "acid component 1") is represented by the formula (5s)<br><br>
wherein A and X are as defined above, and examples thereof are 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride, methyl-substituted 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, methyl-substituted cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride and phthalic anhydride.<br><br>
While the position of double bond in cyclohexenedicarboxylic aeidTmay be any position relative to its acid anhydride group (-CO-0-CO-) without specific limitation, from the standpoint of hydrolysis stability, one wherein the acid anhydride group (-CO-O-CO-)is attached to the 1,2-positions and the double bond is present between 4- and 5-positions is preferable.<br>
Specific examples of the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic anhydride to be used herein are 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic anhydride, 1-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride, 3-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, 4-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride, 3-methyl-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride, 4-methyl-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride and phthalic anhyride.<br>
In esterification, the above alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic anhydrides can be used either alone or in combination.<br>
In carrying out the first-stage esterification reaction, "alcohol component 1" is used in an amount of 0.5 to 1.5 moles, preferably 0.8 to 1.2 moles, per mole of acid component 1. "Alcohol component 1"  may be a single alcohol or an alcohol mixture. "Alcohol component 1" comprises a monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms (P) and<br><br>
optionally a monohydric alcohol of 6 to 18 carbon atoms (Q) wherein (P) : (Q) mole ratio is 0.1 : 99.9 to 100 : 0 (mole ratio). It is recommended that the mole ratio of the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms (P) : the monohydric alcohol of 6 to 18 carbon atoms (Q) is preferably (P) : (Q) = 5 : 95 to 100 : 0 (mole ratio), in particular (P) : (Q) = 40 : 60 to 100 : 0.<br>
The first-stage esterification reaction can be effected in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of a sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst, preferably in the absence of a catalyst.<br>
The sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst for use is a catalyst which do not contain a sulfur element and a phosphorus element in the elements constituting the catalyst. Specifically, examples of the catalyst are Lewis acids and alkali metals, etc. which do not contain a sulfur element or a phosphorus element. More specifically, examples of Lewis acids are aluminum derivatives, tin derivatives, titanium derivatives, lead derivatives and zinc derivatives. Examples of alkali metals are sodium alkoxide, potassium alkoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. These catalysts can be used either alone or in combination. Preferred catalysts are those which also do not contain a sulfur element and phosphorus element as impurities.<br><br>
Among such catalysts, it is particularly preferable to use tetra(C3-C8 alkyl) titanate, titanium oxide, titanium<br>
hydroxide, sodium alkoxide of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, sodium hydroxide, C3-C12 fatty acid tin salt, tin oxide, tin hydroxide, zinc oxide, zinc hydroxide, lead oxide, lead hydroxide, aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide. The amount of the catalyst to be used is, for example, about 0.05 to about 1 wt.% based on the total amount of acid component 1 and alcohol component 1 used as the raw materials for synthesis of the ester.<br>
The reaction temperature for the first-stage esterification is, for example, 110 to 150°C and the reaction is usually carried out for 0.5 to 3 hours.<br>
In the first-stage esterification reaction, theoretically 1 mole of the acid anhydride can react with 1 mole of "alcohol component 1" to give the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5). In the course of the reaction, there is produced a small amount of a diester such as alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester. In other words, actually the reaction product of first-stage esterification reaction may contain a diester in addition to the monoester of the formula (5). Possibly the reaction product further contains the acid anhydride, dicarboxylic acid, and alcohol used as the raw materials. In the<br><br>
specification, the term "a first reaction mixture" is used to include the above reaction product possibly containing these substances. The composition thereof can be analyzed by gas chromatography.<br>
The reaction pressure in the esterification reaction is not particularly limited, and may be atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure (e.g., 133 to 66500 Pa). However, it is recommended to carry out the esterification reaction under atmospheric pressure from the standpoint of giving the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxyllc acid monoester represented by the formula (5) with high selectivity.<br>
When an oxide, peroxide, carbonyl compound and like oxygen-containing organic compounds are produced in the exterification reaction due to oxidative deterioration of the raw materials, the obtained ester and the organic solvent (water-entraining agent), the hygroscopicity, hydrolysis stability and electrical insulating property would be adversely affected. Consequently, the reaction is preferably carried out in an atmosphere or stream of inert gas such as nitrogen gas. Step (b): second-stflge esterification reaction<br>
The first reaction mixture containing the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxyllc acid monoester of the formula (5) prepared in the first-stage is esterified with<br><br>
"alcohol component 2" to produce a reaction mixture (hereinafter referred to as "a second reaction mixture") containing an alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester of the formula (4).<br>
The second-stage esterification reaction can be conducted after the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5) is isolated from the reaction product. The isolation can be performed by conventional methods such as distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, column chromatography or the like. However, in view of economy, it is desirable to continuously conduct the first-stage and second-stage esterification reactions without isolation of the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5).<br>
Specific examples of the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5) are monomethyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, monoethyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, mono(n-propyl) 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, monoisopropyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, mono(n-butyl) 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, monoisobutyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, mono(sec-butyl) 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, mono(n-heptyl) 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, monoisoheptyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, mono(n-octyl) 1,2-<br><br>

In the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5), the positions of the ester group and free carboxylic acid group are not limited. Thus, for example, when the ester group is present at the 1-position, the free carboxylic acid group is present in the 2-position, and when the ester group is present at the 2-position, the free carboxylic acid group is present in the 1-position.<br>
The first reaction mixture containing the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5) further contains, for example in the case of isobutyl ester, monoisobutyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, diisobutyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, isobutanol, 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxlic anhydride, 1,2-cyclohexane-dicarboxylic acid, etc.<br>
In the second stage esterification reaction, "alcohol component 2" is used. "Alcohol component 2" may be a single alcohol or a mixture of alcohols, and comprises a monohydric alcohol of 6 to 18 carbon atoms (T) and optionally a monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms (S) wherein (S) : (T) mole ratio is 0 : 100 to 99.9 : 0.1 (mole ratio). It is recommended that the mole ratio of the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms (S) : the monohydric alcohol of 6 to 18 carbon atoms (T) is (S) : (T)<br><br>
= 0 : 100 to 95:5 (mole ratio), especially (S) : (T) = 0 : 100 to 40 : 60 (mole ratio).<br>
Examples of the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms (S) are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, n-pentanol, isopentanol and like aliphatic monohydric alcohols of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, cyclopropanol, cyclobutanol, cyclopentanol and like alicyclic monohydric alcohols of 3 to 5 carbon atoms and the like. These alcohols can be used either alone or in combination. Among them, monohydric alcohols of 3 to 5 carbon atoms are preferable to improve the lubricity.<br>
Examples of the monohydric alcohol of 6 to 18 carbon atoms (T) to be used herein are n-hexanol, isohexanol, n-heptanol, 2-methylhexanol, isoheptanol, n-octanol, 2-ethylhexanol, 2-octanol, isooctanol, 2-methylheptanol, n-nonanol, isononanol, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanol, 2,6-dimethyl-4-heptanol, n-decanol, isodecanol, n-undecanol, isoundecanol, n-dodecanol, isododecanol, n-tridecanol, isotridecanol, n-tetradecanol, isotetradecanol, n-pentadecanol, isopentadecanol, n-hexadecanol, isohexadecanol, n-heptadecanol, isoheptadecanol, n-octadecanol, isooctadecanol, hexenol, 5-hexenol, 2-heptenol, 6-heptenol, 2-octenol, 8-nonenol, 2-decenol, 2-undecenol, 10-undecenol, 11-dodecenol, 12-tridecenol, 2-tetradecenol, 2-pentadecenol, 2-hexadecenol, 15-hexadecenol, 2-<br><br>
heptadecenol, 2-octadecenol, 9-octadecenol and like aliphatic monohydric alcohols of 6 to 18 carbon atoms, cyclohexanol, methylcyclohexanol, dimethyl-cyclohexanol and like alicyclic monohydric alcohols of 6 to 10 carbon atoms. These alcohols can be used either alone or in combination. Among them, to improve miscibility with a refrigerant, saturated aliphatic monohydric alcohols of 6 to 11 carbon atoms are preferably used and branched-chain saturated aliphatic monohydric alcohols of 6 to 11 carbon atoms are more preferably used.<br>
The amount of "alcohol component 2" to be used in the second-stage esterification reaction can not be particularly limited because it is variable depending on the amount of free carboxylic acid group in the first reaction mixture containing alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid monoester of the formula (5). The amount thereof is proper if it is sufficient to quantitatively give the contemplated mixed diester. For example, "alcohol component 2" may be used in an amount of 1 to 1.5 moles per mole of the monoester of the formula (5) in the first reaction mixture. The amount of the monoester in the first reaction mixture can be calculated by measuring the total acid number of the first reaction mixture.<br>
Alternatively, when the first-stage reaction and the second-stage reaction are consecutively carried out without<br><br>
isolating the monoester of the formula (5) obtained in the first-stage, "alcohol component 2" may be used in an amount such that the total amount of "alcohol component 1" and "alcohol component 2" is 2.0 to 2.5 moles, preferably 2.0 to 2.1 moles, per mole of "acid component 1". For example, when the amount of "alcohol component 1" to be used is 0.5 to 1.5 moles, the amount of "alcohol component 2" is 0.5 to 1.0 mole.<br>
In order to avoid decrease in the reaction velocity due to a sudden decrease in the reaction temperature, it is preferable to gradually add alcohol component 2.<br>
The reaction temperature for the second-stage esterification reaction is, e.g., 160 to 230°C. Usually the reaction is completed in 2 to 20 hours.<br>
It is recommended that alcohol component 1 and alcohol component 2 to be used in esterification preferably have a peroxide value of preferably 1.0 meq/kg or less, more preferably 0.5 meg/kg or less. Furthermore, it is recommended that these alcohol components have a carbonyl value of preferably 15 or less, more preferably 5 or less, most preferably 1 or less.<br>
When the ester is prepared using an alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less and a carbonyl value of 5 or less, the obtained ester shows excellent properties as a refrigerator oil. When the ester is prepared using<br><br>
alcohols having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less and a carbonyl value of 1 or less, the obtained ester shows markedly superior properties as a refrigerator oil.<br>
The term "peroxide value" used herein is described in 2.5.2-1996 of Standard Methods for the Analysis of Fats, Oil and Related Materials (Japan Oil Chemists" Society), and refers to an amount of iodine released by addition of potassium iodide to a sample and expressed in milliequivalent per kilogram of the sample, according to the method described therein.<br>
The term "carbonyl value" used herein is described in 2.5.4-1996 of Standard Methods for the Analysis of Fats, Oil and Related Materials (Japan Oil Chemists" Society), and refers to a value obtained by causing 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to act on a sample and converting the value of its absorbance at 440 nm to a value per gram of the sample, according to the method described therein.<br>
When an alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less is used, the obtained alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid mixed diester is less adversely affected in properties such as hue, total acid number and peroxide value and is excellent in the properties such as electrical insulating property, heat stability and hydrolysis stability.<br>
An alcohol having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or<br>
P*<br><br>
less can be prepared by purifying an alcohol having a peroxide value of more than 1.0 meq/kg through distillation or through a treatment with a reducing agent to thereby decrease the peroxide value.<br>
Generally an alcohol immediately after distillation has a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less. However, such alcohol may show a peroxide value of more than 1.0 meq/kg due to oxidation during a long-term storage (e.g. storage for 6 months or longer) depending on the storage conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm a peroxide value of the alcohol before esterification.<br>
The purification by distillation can be performed, e.g. by distilling an alcohol having a peroxide value exceeding 1.0 meq/kg at 50-300°C in the presence of an alkali compound under reduced pressure. Useful alkali compounds include, for example, NaOH, KOH, LiOH, etc. It is recommendable to use the alkali compound in an amount of 0.001 to 0.5 wt.% based on the alcohol.<br>
The purification by reduction can be conducted, e.g. by stirring an alcohol having a peroxide value exceeding 1.0 meq/kg at 30-150°C in the presence of a reducing agent for 30 minutes to 5 hours, preferably 1 to 2 hours. Useful reducing agents include, for example, sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, lithium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, etc. It is recommendable to use the<br><br>
reducing agent in an amount of 30 to 10,000 ppm based on the alcohol.<br>
When an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester is prepared using an alcohol having a carbonyl value of 15 or less, preferably 5 or less, more preferably 1 or less, the obtained ester has excellent hue and reduced peroxide value.<br>
In the case of an alcohol having a carbonyl value of more than 15 as well, its carbonyl value can be decreased to 15 or less by purification through distillation or by purification through reduction, which may be carried out following the procedure of the foregoing method for lowering the peroxide value.<br>
The second-stage esterification reaction may be carried out in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of a sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst. However, it is recommended to carry out the esterification reaction in the presence of a sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst.<br>
The sulfur-free and phosphorus-free catalyst is a catalyst which does not contain a sulfur element or a phosphorus element in the elements constituting the catalyst. Specifically, examples of the catalyst are Lewis acids and alkali metals, etc. which contain neither a sulfur element nor a phosphorus element. More specifically, /examples of Lewis acids are aluminum derivatives, tin derivatives, titanium derivatives, lead derivatives and<br><br>
zinc derivatives. Examples of alkali metals are sodium alkoxide, potassium alkoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. These catalysts can be used either alone or in combination. Preferred catalysts are those which do not contain a sulfur element and a phosphorus element as the impurities.<br>
Among such catalysts, it is particularly preferable to use tetra(C3-Cg alkyl) titanate, titanium oxide, titanium<br>
hydroxide, sodium alkoxide of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, sodium hydroxide, C3-C12 fatty acid tin salt, tin oxide, tin hydroxide, zinc oxide, zinc hydroxide, lead oxide, lead hydroxide, aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide. The amount of the catalyst to be used is, for example, about 0.05 to about 1 wt.% based on the total amount of the first reaction mixture and alcohol component 2.<br>
To accelerate the distillation of water generated by the reaction in esterification, a water-entraining agent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane or the like may be used in esterification.<br>
The esterification reaction may be carried out under atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure (e.g., 133 to 66500 Pa). However, from a viewpoint of accelerating the esterification reaction, it is preferable to combine esterification reaction under atmospheric pressure and esterification reaction under reduced pressure.<br>
to 7<br><br>
Particularly, it is recommended to carry out the esterification reaction under reduced pressure in a later stage of the reaction (such as the stage in which the total acid number of the reaction mixture becomes about 10 mgKOH/g or less) when the esterification reaction velocity becomes low.<br>
When an oxide, peroxide, carbonyl compound and like oxygen-containing organic compounds are produced due to oxidative deterioration of the raw materials, the obtained ester and the organic solvent (water-entraining agent) in the esterification reaction, the hygroscopic!ty, hydrolysis stability and electrical insulating property would be adversely affected. Consequently, the esterification reaction is preferably carried out in an atmosphere or stream of inert gas such as nitrogen gas.<br>
In the preparation of the alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid mixed diester represented by the formula (4) of the present invention, when the proportion of an monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms [(P)+(S)] is 10 to 90 mole%, relative to the total amount t(P)+(Q)+(S)+(T)] of alcohol component 1 [(P)+(Q)] used in the first-stage esterification reaction and alcohol component 2 [(S)+(T)] used in the second-stage esterification reaction, it is recommended, from the standpoint of reducing the reaction time,<br><br>
l)to use the whole amount of the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms as (P) in the first-stage esterification reaction and to use 0 mole% of said alcohol in the second-stage esterification reaction, when said proportion of the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms [(P)+(S)] is not less than 10 mole% and not greater than 50 mole%, and 2)to use the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms as (P) in an amount of 50 mole% relative to the total alcohol amount [(P)+(Q)+(S)+(T)] in the first-stage esterification reaction and to use the rest of said monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms as (S) in the second-stage esterification reaction, when said proportion of the monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms [(P)+(S)] is more than 50 mole% and not more than 90 mole%.<br>
When the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester represented by the formula (4) is prepared by the process of the present invention, two species of esters represented by the formula (6) are concurrently produced as by-products, but no problem arises even if the reaction product contains such ester compounds.<br><br><br>
wherein X, A and R5are as defined above, two R5 are the same, and the two -COOR5 groups are attached to two adjacent carbon atoms of a cyclohexane ring, a cyclohexene ring or a benzene ring;<br>
When using, e.g. a monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms (R5aOH) as alcohol component 1 and a monohydric alcohol of 6 to 18 carbon atoms (R^aOH) as alcohol component 2, or when using a single alcohol or an alcohol mixture comprising a monohydric alcohol of 1 to 5 carbon atoms<br>

represented by the formulas (7) and (8) given below are<br><br>
produced as by-products, in addition to the mixed diester represented by the formula (4a) according to the present invention, but the diesters represented by the formulas (7) and (8) can be used as a refrigerator oil as admixed with the mixed diester of the formula (4a) according to the invention:<br>

After completion of the esterification reaction, the excess starting materials are distilled off under reduced pressure or under atmospheric pressure. When the process is intended to prepare only the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester of the formula (4) (e.g. the ester of the formula (4a)), the ester mixture (e.g. an<br>
ster mixture of an ester of the formula (7), an ester of the formula (4a) and an ester of the formula (8)) prepared by the foregoing process may be purified by distillation to remove the ester of the formula (6) (e.g. the esters of the<br><br>
formulas (7) and (8)). In this case, it is preferable to purify the ester mixture by the method to be described below and then separate the ester of the formula (4a) by a known method such as distillation.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, however, it has been found that an ester mixture of 1) an ester of the formula (7), 2) a mixed diester of the formula (4a) and 3) an ester of the formula (8) is useful as a refrigerator oil.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a "lubricating oil for a refrigerator (refrigerator oil) comprising a mixture of:<br>
1)	an ester of the formula (7),<br>
2)	a mixed diester of the formula (4a) and<br>
3)	an ester of the formula (8).<br>
A wider range of the proportions of esters 1), 2) and 3) in the above mixture is made available by changing the ratio of alcohol component 1 and alcohol component 2 to be used or can vary by changing the reaction temperature and reaction time in step (b). Generally, it is preferable that mixed diester 2) is present in a proportion of 100, ester 1) is present in a proportion of about 5 to 300, particularly 7 to 100 and ester 3) is present in a proportion of 7 to 500, preferably 10 to 350. Herein, the proportions are expressed by area ratio as determined on a gas chromatogram of a mixture of esters 1), 2) and 3). The<br><br>
conditions under which gas chromatography is conducted will be described in Examples.<br>
Purification of eater of the invention<br>
In embodiment I and in embodiment II as well, after the esterification reaction, the step of evaporating the excess starting materials (especially alcohols) from a reaction mixture under reduced pressure (at 133 to 66500 Pa) or under atmospheric pressure at 100 to 230" C, and the neutralization and water-washing step of the obtained crude ester are carried out.<br>
The order of carrying out the excess starting material evaporation step and the neutralization and water-swashing step is not particularly limited, but it is preferable to conduct the excess starting material evaporation step first, followed by the neutralization and water-washing step.<br>
Neutralization can be carried out by various methods. For example, neutralization step is preferably carried out as follows: First, a 0.1 to 10 wt.% aqueous solution of alkali (an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate) is added to an esterification reaction product obtained by evaporation of<br><br>
excess alcohol(s) after the esterification reaction or acid component and alcohol component used as the starting materials in the esterification reaction. The amount of the aqueous solution of alkali is preferably 2 to 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of said esterification reaction product or per 100 parts by weight of a total weight of the acid component and alcohol. Then, the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature to 90° C for 10 minutes to 5 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 2 hours. By this neutralization, unreacted carboxylic acid(s) can be removed and the catalyst used in the reaction and organometallic compounds derived from the catalyst are decomposed.<br>
The step of washing the crude product with water after the neutralization is carried out until the washings (= water used for this washing step) are neutral, and the method of washing is not particularly limited. For example, the water-washing step can be carried out at room temperature to 90°C by using water in a total amount of 10 to 1000 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of said crude product until the washings are neutral.<br>
Whether the neutralization is complete or not can be confirmed by measuring the total acid number of the esterification reaction product (crude ester) after being washed with water. For example, the neutralization may be<br><br>
carried out until the total acid number of the ssterification reaction product (crude ester) becomes 0.05 ngKOH/g or less, preferably about 0.02 mgKOH/g. When the ssterification reaction product (crude ester) has a total acid number of higher than 0.05 mgKOH/g, it is preferable to carry out the neutralization and washing with water again until the total acid number of the esterification ceaction product (crude ester) becomes 0.05 mgKOH/g or less.<br>
Then, purification step is carried out using liquid-liquid extraction or distillation under reduced pressure or purification by adsorbents or the like to purify the ester. In the purification step, it is recommended to use a procedure which do not allow incorporation of a sulfur slement and/or phosphorus element into the ester.<br>
The obtained ester contains various impurities depending on the producing process. Examples of such impurities are acidic compounds, metal compounds, hetero atom-containing compounds, oxygen-containing organic compounds and the like. The acidic compounds include inorganic and organic acid components. The metal compounds . include metals in general derived from the raw materials and the catalyst. The hetero atom-containing compounds include sulfur-containing compounds, phosphorus-containing compounds, etc. The oxygen-containing organic compounds include peroxides, carbonyl compounds and the like which<br><br>
would particularly affect the ester. These impurities may deteriorate the hydrolysis stability, electrical insulating property and heat stability and may lead to corrosion of metal parts and to generation of sludge. For this reason, it is desirable to sufficiently remove the impurities from the ester in the purification step.<br>
Among the foregoing procedures for the purification step, distillation under reduced pressure, purification using adsorbents are particularly preferable, and the purification using adsorbents is more preferable.<br>
Liquid-liquid extraction can be carried out by a conventional liquid-liquid extraction method using one or more organic solvents such as hexane, toluene, xylene, methanol and the like.<br>
Distillation under reduced pressure can be carried out at a temperature of 100 to 300" C at a reduced pressure of 13 to 13300 Pa.<br>
The purification using adsorbents which is a more preferable procedure will be described below in detail.<br>
Useful adsorbents include, for example, natural or synthetic adsorbents, specifically activated carbon, activated alumina, silica gel, silica-alumina, activated clay, zeolite, magnesia, calcia, diatomaceous earth, hydrotalcite, as well as synthetic adsorbents such as ion exchange resins of the non-sulfonic acid type, synthetic<br><br>
hydrotalcite and the like. The amount of the adsorbent(s) to be used may very depending on the kind thereof, but, it is recommendable to use the adsorbent(s) in an amount of 0.01 to 5 wt.%, preferably 0.05 to 5 wt.%, relative to the theoretical yield of the alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid diester of the formula (E) of the present invention.<br>
In the purification with an adsorbent, it is advantageous to use, for example, 1 to 4 kinds of adsorbents, particularly 2 to 4 kinds of adsorbents in combination.<br>
The shape of the adsorbent to be used in the present invention is not limited, and examples thereof are powders, molded products among which powders are preferred.<br>
It is recommended that the particle size of the powdery adsorbents is, for example, 0.01 to 1000 um, preferably 0.1 to 500 um.<br>
When at least 2 kinds of adsorbents are used, adsorption treatment may be performed using one adsorbent for one of operations (stepwise), or using said at least 2 kinds of adsorbents in admixture for a single adsorption procedure. It is recommended to use at least 2 kinds of adsorbents in admixture for a single adsorption procedure.<br>
The combined use of at least 2 adsorbents different in adsorption mechanisms is more effective. For example, activated carbon effects physical adsorption of polar<br><br>
substances, and activated alumina brings about physical adsorption of acidic substances. Silica gel causes adsorption due to hydrogen bond between a polar substance and a silanol group existing on the surface of silica gel.<br>
Examples of preferred combinations of adsorbents are as follows:<br>
•activated carbon + activated alumina,<br>
•activated carbon + silica gel,<br>
•activated carbon + magnesia,<br>
•activated carbon + activated clay,<br>
•activated carbon + silica-alumina,<br>
•activated alumina + activated clay,<br>
•activated carbon + zeolite,<br>
•activated carbon + hydrotalcite,<br>
•activated clay + zeolite.<br>
To improve adsorption performance, the combined use of at least 3 adsorbents is also effective. Examples of such combinations are as follows.<br>
•Activated carbon + activated alumina + silica gel,<br>
•Activated carbon + silica gel + magnesia,<br>
•Activated carbon + activated clay + activated<br>
alumina,<br>
•Activated carbon + hydrotalcite + zeolite,<br>
•Activated carbon + activated clay + hydrotalcite.<br>
When two adsorbents are used conjointly, the<br><br>
proportions of said two adsorbents are not particularly limited and are variable depending on the kind of adsorbents. Usually, it is recommended that they are used in a weight ratio of, for example, 1/100 to 100/1, preferably 1/9 to 9/1, more preferably 3/7 to 7/3.<br>
When three or more adsorbents are used, the proportions of these adsorbents are as follows. For example, when 3 adsorbents are used, it is recommended to use the foregoing two adsorbents and a third adsorbent wherein the weight ratio of said two adsorbents/the third adsorbent is, for example, 1/100 to 100/1, preferably 1/9 to 9/1, more preferably 3/7 to 7/3.<br>
When 4 adsorbents are used, it is recommended to use the foregoing three adsorbents and a fourth adsorbent wherein the weight ratio of said three adsorbents/the fourth adsorbent is, for example, 1/100 to 100/1, preferably 1/9 to 9/1, more preferably 3/7 to 7/3.<br>
The adsorbents to be used in the invention may be dehydrated before use to enhance the adsorbing ability. For example, dehydration before use is conducted at 60°C to 150° C for 30 minutes to 10 hours under atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure, preferably a reduced pressure of 133 to 66500 Pa (1-500 mmHg).<br>
The purification method by adsorption is exemplified below.<br><br>
1) 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by weight of two or more adsorbents are added to 100 parts by weight of the dicaFboxylic acid diester prepared by the foregoing process of embodiment I or embodiment II and<br>
"" s-ulojectea to the neutralisation ana crater-washing steps. The mixture is stirred with heating at 70 to 120°C, preferably 80°C to 110° C for 10 minutes to 2 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 1 hour, under atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure (e.g. 133 to 66500 Pa (1-500 mmHg)). In this procedure, an adsorption column charged with adsorbents may be used, and the adsorption treatment is carried out by passing the ester through the column.<br>
2) The ester prepared by the foregoing process is treated according to the above-mentioned method 1) using<br>
,-- one adsorbent, followed by further adsorption treatment with another adsorbent. Optionally two or more adsorption columns may be set in series and individually charged with an adsorbent, and the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester is passed through the columns one by one for adsorption treatment.<br>
Herein, it is recommended that an aqueous solution of an alkali, water, organic solvents, adsorbents and the like to be used in the water-washing step, neutralization step<br>
 and purification step should be completely or substantially free of a sulfur element and/or a phosphorus element.<br><br>
It is recommended that the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester represented by the formula (1) and the alicyclic or aromatic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester represented by the formula (4), as well as refrigerator lubricating oil comprising one or more of these esters have a water content of 100 ppm or less, preferably 50 ppm or less. Therefore, it is preferable to remove water by sufficiently carrying out dehydration treatment. The dehydration may be carried out, for example, under atmospheric or reduced pressure, preferably under a reduced pressure of 133 Pa to 66500 Pa, at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 150°C, preferably 50 to 140° C, for 0.1 hour to 10 hours. If the water content exceeds 100 ppm, hydrolysis might possibly take place, thereby affecting electrical insulation properties, heat stability and hydrolysis stability.<br>
When the foregoing purification step and the dehydration step are carried out, the order thereof is not particularly limited. However, there is a possibility that _ the ester may absorb water during the purification step, and therefore it is preferable to carry out dehydration step after the purification step.<br>
A preferred method for preparing the alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid diester represented by the formula (E) according to the present invention<br><br>
recommendably comprises the steps of<br>
(i) carrying out the esterification reactions by the method<br>

2)	The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester prepared using an aliphatic monohydric alcohol having a peroxide<br><br>
value of not more than 1.0 meq/kg and having a carbonyl value of 15 or less can exhibit more improved properties in respect of hue, peroxide value, heat stability and long-term hydrolysis stability. "~     3)  The  alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diester prepared by esterlfication reaction in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of a sulfur-free and phosphorus-free<br>
catalyst has a volume resistivity of 1.0 x 1011 Q*cm or more and involves only a small degree of increase in acid number by heating, and thus shows a high heat stability and also outstanding long-term hydrolysis stability.<br>
The mixed diester prepared by the 2-step esterlfication process according to embodiment II of the invention, when used as a refrigerator oil, produces the following effects.<br>
1) Said mixed diester can be prepared under milder conditions than the mixed diester prepared by the 1-step esterlfication process, and is of high quality. This ester, when used as a refrigerator oil, displays a high hydrolysis stability, a high heat stability and an excellent electrical insulating property. For example, the alicyclic adjacent dicarboxylic acid mixed diester prepared by the 1-/-step esterlfication process or the ester prepared by the 2-step esterlfication process in the presence of a sulfur-containing catalyst is insufficient in hydrolysis stability<br><br>
and heat stability, whereas the ester prepared by the 2-step esterification process according to the present invention is much improved in hydrolysis stability, heat stability and electrical insulating property.<br>
2)	By suitably changing the kinds and/or mixing ratio of alcohols in alcohol component 1 and alcohol component 2 used for esterification, the desired mixed diester can be prepared which can satisfy the need for various viscosity characteristics.<br>
3)	In preparing the mixed diester according to the 2-step esterification reaction, the use of aliphatic monohydrlc alcohol(s) having a peroxide value of 1.0 meq/kg or less and further having a carbonyl value of 15 or less gives the desired mixed diester which is still more<br>
— advantageous with respect to peroxide value, heat stability and hydrolysis stability.<br>
It is known that a refrigeration system is exposed to a pronouncedly high temperature due to friction during the operation of a compressor in a refrigerator. In view of this condition, it is important for the refrigerator oil to have a high heat stability and to exhibit a high stability during exposure to a high temperature. The electrical insulating property is also important to prevent an accident due to leakage during the operation of a refrigerator. After the ester is exposed to a high<br><br>
temperature, the smaller the increase of total acid number<br>
is, the higher the heat stability is. The higher the volume<br>
resistivity of the ester ±$.  the higher the electrical<br>
insulating property is.<br>
Examples of refrigerators for which the refrigerator<br>
oil of the invention can i&gt;0  used are compressors in<br>
automotive air conditioners?, refrigerators, automatic<br>
vending machines, refrigeration-type display cases, room<br>
air conditioners or large-i3ize refrigerators for industrial<br>
use or the like in which h?drofluorocarbon is used as £<br>
refrigerant.<br>

The volume resistivity was measured at 25" C according to JIS-C-2101. The higher the volume resistivity is, the<br><br>
more excellent the electrical insulating property is. Test for heat stability<br>
Iron wire, copper wire and aluminum wire, 1.6 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length, were placed in a beaker of 53 mm in inner diameter and 56 mm in height. 40  g of an ester sample was weighed out and introduced into the beaker. The beaker was placed in an oven and was heated at 175° C for 15 hours. Then the ester sample was taken out to measure the total acid number. The smaller the increase in total acid number after the test as compared with that before the test is, the higher the heat stability is. The result obtained in this test is an index of resistance of the ester to oxidative deterioration. Test for hydrolysis stability<br>
Iron wire, copper wire and aluminum wire of 1.6 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length were placed in a glass test tube of 6.6 mm in inner diameter and 30 cm in height. Then, 2.0 g of an ester sample and 0.2 g of distilled water were weighed out and introduced into the test tube. The test<br>
^tube was sealed while it was degassed by an aspirator. The test tube was placed into an oven and was heated at 175°C for 80 hours. Then the ester sample was taken out to measure the total acid number. It is considered that the smaller the increase in total acid number is, the higher<br>
the hydrolysis stability is. The result obtained in this<br><br>
test is an index of hydrolysis resistance of the ester as heated in the presence of water. Water content<br>
Measured according to JIS-K-2275 using Karl Fischer"s moisture meter (MKC-510, product of Kyoto Denshi Kabushiki Kaisha)<br>
Example 1-1<br>
A 4-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a Dean-Stark water separator was charged with 152.1 g (1 mole) of 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic anhydride (prepared by usual Diels-Alder reaction of malexc anhydride with 1,3-butadiene), 162.8 g (2.2 moles) of isobutanol having a peroxide value of 0.2 meq/kg and a carbonyl value of 0.3 and xylene (5 wt.% relative to the starting materials fed). Then, the mixture was gradually heated to 220" C in the presence of tin hydroxide catalyst (0.2 wt.% based on the starting materials fed) in a nitrogen atmosphere. While water generated during the reaction was removed by means of the water separator, the esterification reaction was conducted at 220° C for 15 hours until the total acid number of the reaction mixture became 2 mgKOH/g or less. Thereafter, the reaction was continued .at 220°C under reduced pressure (20000Pa) for about 6 hours.<br>
After the reaction, the excess isobutanol was removed<br><br>
by distillation at 180° C under a reduced pressure of 1330 Pa, and the obtained liquid residue was neutralized by adding 22g of a 4 % aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and stirring the mixture at 80° C for 2 hours, and then washed with water until the aqueous layer became neutral (total amount of water used: about 2000ml) to thereby give a liquid crude ester. At this point, the crude ester had a total acid number of 0.02 mgKOH/g. Subsequently, to the ester was added activated alumina ("Tomita-AD 220P"<br>
"manufactured by Tomita Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.; 0.2 wt.% based on the starting materials fed, namely 0.22 wt.% relative to the theoretical yield of the ester), and the mixture was stirred at 90°C and at 1330 Pa for 1 hour, and the activated alumina was filtered off, whereby 269 g of purified diisobutyl 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylate was obtained. Dehydration was carried out at 100°C under a reduced pressure of 1330 Pa for 6 hours.<br>
The total acid number and kinematic viscosity of the<br>
-obtained ester are shown in Table 1.

Table 3<br><br><br>
As apparent from Examples 1-1 to 1-8, the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diesters prepared by the process of the present invention are excellent in hue, electrical insulating property, heat stability and hydrolysis stability so that they are suitable for use as a refrigerator oil.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Comparative Examples 1-1 to 1-4, the esters prepared by the reaction using a sulfur- or phosphorus-containing catalyst or the esters prepared using an alcohol having a peroxide value in excess of l.o mgKOH/g are poor in hue and high in peroxide value and carbonyl value even if neutralization and treatment with an adsorbent are sufficiently carried out. Further, the total acid numbers of these esters are considerably increased in the test for the evaluation of heat stability and hydrolysis stability, and the volume resistivity thereof is also low in the test for the evaluation of electrical insulating property.<br>
As shown by the results of Examples 1-9 and I-10, alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diesters having improved performance can be prepared by purifying the produced esters using at least two kinds of adsorbents.<br>
The process of the present invention provides alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diesters which are excellent in<br><br>
electrical insulating property, heat stability and hydrolysis stability and are suited for use as a refrigerator oil.<br>
Embodiment II of the present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the following examples and comparative examples. The properties of lubricating oils prepared in these examples were evaluated by the following methods. Kinematic viscosity<br>

A sample ester (5.0 g) was diluted with hexane to give a 10.0 ml dilution, and the sulfur content of the ester was measured with a sulfur analyzer, TS-03 (product<br><br>
of Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.). Phosphorus content<br>

Measured according to 2.5.4-1996 (Standard Methods for the Analysis of Fats, Oil and Related Materials (Japan Oil Chemists" Society). Test for electrical insulating property<br>
The volume resistivity was measured at 25° C according to JIS-C-2101. The higher the volume resistivity is, the more excellent the electrical insulating property is. Test for hydrolysis stability<br>
Iron wire, copper wire and aluminum wire, 1.6 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length, were placed in a glass test tube of 6.6 mm in inner diameter and 30 cm in height, and 2.0 g of an ester sample and 0.2 g of distilled water were weighed out and introduced into the test tube. The test tube was sealed while it was degassed by an aspirator. The test tube was placed in an oven and heated at 175°C for 30<br><br><br>
hours. Then the ester sample was taken out to measure the total acid number. It is considered that the smaller the increase in total acid number is, the higher the hydrolysis stability is. The result obtained in this test is an index of hydrolysis resistance of the ester as heated in the presence of water. Test for hP.at. stability<br>
Iron wire, copper wire and aluminum wire, 1.6 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length were placed in a beaker of 53 mm in inner diameter and 56 mm in height, and 40 g of an ester sample was weighed out and introduced into the beaker. The beaker was placed in an oven and heated at 175°C for 15 hours. Then the ester sample was taken out to measure the total acid number. The smaller the increase in acid number after the test as compared with that before the test is, the higher the heat stability is. The result obtained in this test is an index of resistance of the ester to oxidative deterioration. Analysis by gas chromatography<br>
The cis isomer/trans isomer ratio of alicyclic dicarboxylic acid diesters were determined by gas chromatography, and expressed in terms of area ratio of the obtained gas chromatogram. The proportions of the esters in the ester mixtures were also expressed in terms of area ratio of the obtained gas chromatogram. Measurement<br><br>
