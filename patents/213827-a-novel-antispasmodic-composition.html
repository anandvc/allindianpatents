				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention describes a novel composition comprising a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and their salts and their chirally pure forms and two drugs pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide in a pharmaceutically acceptable combination.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Amongst the various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac particularly sodium diclofenac is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. This has been disclosed in the following references (references from US Pat. No. 5202159)<br>
As such, Intestinal, ureteric and biliary colic are extremely common clinical conditions requiring prompt medical attention to relieve the symptoms and help the patient get back to his/her vocation to avoid/minimize economic loss and reduce the load on the medical institution. Non-surgical treatment can provide immediate relief to the patient while investigations are being carried out to determine the future course of management. Currently available treatment modalities include anticholinergics like, atropine and its derivatives, ambutonium, glycopyrronium, isoperopamide, pripenzolate, etc. Combination therapy with analgin, pitofenone and fenpiverinium are also used. In addition, drugs such as mebeverine valethamate bromide, clidinium are also used with.<br>
All drugs do not provide predictably uniform results in all patients. All the drugs used in these conditions do carry some side effects. Anticholinergics produce dry mouth, tachycardia in some patients, is contraindicated in glaucoma and prostatic hypertrophy and other antispasmodic agents may cause drowsiness as a side effect. Analgin is implicated in causing bone marrow depression.<br>
In the comprehensive review of a pharmacological properties of Diclofenac (Brogden et al, Drugs 20;24-48 (1980) it has been reported to have anti inflammatory activity, analgesic activity and anti pyretic activity. Conventionally it has been used in clinical condition for rheumatic disorders. Recently it has been reported to be of use in painful non-rheumatic syndromes for example biliary colic, {Grossi et al. Current Therapeutic Research, volume 40, No. 5, (1986)} and acute renal colic {Garcia Alonso F. et al, Eur. J. Clin Pharmacol, 40, 543-546 (1991)}.<br>
However it has been reported that Diclofenac Sodium intramuscular is more effective than narcotic analgesic like pethidine intramuscular in the management of acute renal colic and has fewer side effects. Based on the market survey among the various products available as antispasmodic one major product is composed of Analgin with two spasmolytic agents that is pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
No pharmacological composition has been reported in literature as well as no product is available where Diclofenac sodium is employed in combination with spasmolytic agents.<br>
Our findings as disclosed in this patent application indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium when combined with fenpiverinium bromide and pitofenone hydrochloride forms an excellent antispasmodic composition. The composition when given orally and intramuscularly is not only clinically effective but is superior to the existing therapeutic agents. It is superior in two ways one it has more effective action and second it has fewer side effects.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel anti-spasmodic composition comprising diclofenac and like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their salts and pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a process for the manufacture of a novel anti-spasmodic composition comprising diclofenac, pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide a novel injectable delivery system for the anti-spasmodic composition.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide an anti-spasmodic composition, which can be taken orally by way of a Pediatric suspension, capsule/tablet.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An anti-spasmodic composition comprising a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or their salts or their chirally pure forms and two drugs pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
The composition is capable of being used in an oral and parenteral dosage form.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can be used alongwith Pitofenone hydrochloride and Fenpiverinium bromide are selected from Aspirin, Diclofenac, Diflunisal, Etodolac, Flurbiprofen Flurbiprofen sodium, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin/ Indomethacin sodium, Ketoprofen, Mefenamic acid, Naproxen/Naproxen Sodium, Paracetamol, Phenylbutazone, Piroxicam, Sulindac, Ketorolac, Nimesulide and the like.<br>
Several formulations can be made in the form of tablets or injections comprising the three ingredients Diclofenac and like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or their salts, pitofenone hydrochloride and fenpiverinium bromide.<br>
Besides the ingredients disclosed above the composition also comprises the usual excipients like starch, microcrystalline cellulose, DCP, purified talc, magnesium stearate etc. described in the standard text. Tablets may be film coated, sugar coated or specially coated as described in the existing art. (Pharmaceutical Dosage forms : Tablets, vol 1-3, Eds., H.A. Lieberman and L. Lachman Dekker New York.)<br>
Such composition can be administered orally or by intramuscular route they can also be administered in form of modified release, sustained release, controlled release, timed release formulations. They can also be administered by ocular, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and others related administration routes.<br>

*	Non-pregnant females were also included<br><br>
*	Patients with biliary, intestinal and ureteric colic<br>
*	Patients with any of the above conditions who could not be administered   antispasmodic<br>
drugs belonging to the anticholinergic group (patients with glaucoma prostatic hypertrophy) were<br>
also included.<br>
The following patients were excluded:<br>
*	Patients with peptic ulcer disease<br>
*	Patients requiring immediate surgery for their underlying condition were   also  excluded<br>
from the study.<br>
SAMPLE SIZE	:      Fifty patients.<br>
STUDY PROCEDURE:        The study was open labeled.<br>
Patients attending the surgical OPD with complaint of moderate to severe abdominal pain and<br>
diagnosed to have one of the conditions listed in the inclusion criteria were enrolled. According<br>
to the study protocol, patients could be hospitalized for the acute condition for observation, and<br>
parenteral drug to relieve the acute pain was permitted.  If on observation for a few hours, the<br>
patient is relieved of the pain but requires oral medication for continued relief of pain after<br>
discharge from the ward, the patient was put on test medication if the patient qualified the<br>
inclusion criteria.<br>
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST DRUG.<br>
The test drug was administered orally, The dose was one tablet three times daily for a maximum period of five days. Patients administered the test drug were kept in the emergency ward for observation till such time the patient was relieved of the symptoms.<br>
The protocol permitted patients to receive parenteral antispasmodic in cases of severe and disabling colic. Such patients were discharged on the oral test drug given in the dose of one tablet thrice daily for a maximum period of five days.<br>
CONCOMITANT MEDICATION AND DIETARY ADVICE:<br>
Concomitant medication such as antibiotics, urinary antiseptics, medical therapy for gall stones, etc were continued during the protocol therapy. Similarly, any specific dietary restrictions/advice were also continued.<br>
Patients were not permitted any concomitant antispasmodic therapy during the trial.<br><br>
ESCAPE MEDICATION AND TERMINATION OF PROTOCOL THERAPY:<br>
Patients not responding to the test medication within a period of two (2) hours were administered parenteral analgesic. Such patients were deemed treated and not replaced by fresh patients.<br>
All patients on enrollment were subjected to history, clinical examination and history of past drug therapy which included:<br>
1.	Duration of illness<br>
2.	Severity of pain<br>
3.	Frequency of antispasmodic drug intake<br>
4.	Duration of antispasmodic drug use<br>
5.	Relief with existing therapy; excellent, good, fair poor<br>
6.	Need to take parenteral antispasmodic while on existing oral therapy<br>
7.	Side effects with current therapy<br>
EVALUATION PARAMETERS:<br>
The following parameters were used to determine the efficacy and safety of the test medication.<br>
1.	Did the patient receive parenteral antispasmodic prior to oral therapy with the test drug.<br>
2.	Severity of pain after the first dose<br>
3.	Speed of relief<br>
4.	Did the patient need parenteral drug for pain relief after administration of the first dose<br>
of the test drug<br>
5.	Severity of pain at home after subsequent doses<br>
6.	Duration of intake of test drug<br>
7.	Patient's evaluation of the test drug<br>
8.	Investigator's evaluation of the test drug<br>
FINAL EVALUATION :<br>
EXCELLENT: Acute pain relieved in less than half an hour.<br>
Parenteral drug for pain relief not needed. Drug well tolerated without any side effects.<br>
GOOD : Acute pain relieved in one to two hours without any need for parenteral drug for pain relief. Drug well tolerated without any side effects.<br><br>

From the above tables of demographic details, there is no statistically significant difference between the two sexes with relation to age, diagnosis and duration of illness. However, there is a satistically significant difference in the mean number of tablets per week consumed for the relief of ureteric colic for female patients in comparison to males (p, 0.05). Since there were no male patients with biliary colic, it is not possible to determine the difference between the two sexes.<br>
Past history of patenteral antispasmodic drug intake<br>
Almost all patients needed parenteral antispasmodic drugs for symptomatic relief while on oral antispasmodic drugs. Although all patients were not able to exactly remember, the frequency of parenteral antispasmodic drug therapy varied from once every one month to two to four times every month.<br>
Most of the patients of both sexes reported uniformly good response with existing antispasmodic drug therapy. Five patients of intestinal colic, three of ureteric colic and two of biliary colic reported uncomfortable side effect such as, dry mouth and pa;petitions with anticholinergic drugs.<br>
Need for additional parenteral antispasmodic drug in the present study:<br>
No patient required parenteral antispasmodic drug in the present study.<br>

All the patients irrespective of diagnosis took three tablets on day 1 and 2 tablets on day 2. However, on day 3 patients of intestinal and ureteric colic took 1 tablet and did not take any tablets on days 4 and 5 while patients of biliary colic continued to take 2 tablets on days 2 and 3 and one tablet on day 4. On day 5 patients of biliary colic aid not need any medication.<br>
Patients were instructed to bring the container along with the unconsumed tablets to the clinic on day 5 to determine the number of tablets the patients actually consumed after discharge from the hospital.<br>
