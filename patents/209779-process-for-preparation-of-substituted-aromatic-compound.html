Process for preparation of substituted aromatic compound<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of substituted aromatic compounds that are useful as products or intermediates for industrial chemicals, polymers, medical and agricultural chemicals and others, using halogenated aromatic compounds, especially chlorinated aromatic compounds that are industrially producible and available at a low price as starting materials and by substituting the chlorine atom of the above described chlorinated compounds with various nucleophilic substances.<br>
Background Art<br>
As one method for producing substituted aromatic compounds, a nucleophilic substitution reaction of aromatics is known in which a halogenated aromatic compound is reacted with a nucleophilic agent to substitute the above described halogen atom with the nucleophilic species , but it is also known that generally a halogenated aromatic compound has remarkably low reactivity to a nucleophilic species as compared to a aliphatic halogenated compound. However, if a specif ic substituent exists at a specific - position of an aromatic ring as in p-nitrochlorobenzene, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, or p-benzoylchlorobenzene (active halogenated aromatic compounds), the halogen atoms of the<br>

easily the reaction.<br>
On the other hand, as described in "Organic Chemistry (the<br>
last volume, Japanese version)", 5th edition written by R. T. Morrison and R. H. Boyd, page 1289 that "it wiil end in failure even if a halogenated aryl compound (this is an inactive halogenated aromatic compound in the present invention) or a halogenated vinyl compound is tried to be treated with a usual nucleophilic reaction agent to convert phenol, ether, amine or nitrile" , it is described each in the following literatures that an inactive halogenated aromatic compound, such as chlorobenzene, p-bromobenzene, o-methoxyiodobenzene or the like, in which no such a substituent exists does not react with a nucleophilic agent unless 1 the reaction is carried out in very severe reaction conditions, or 2 once the halogen atom in the halogenated compound is activated by making it an organic metal complex in which the aromatic ring is a ligand, or ® a catalyst is made to exist 1 Fyfe, in Patai, "The Chemistry of the Hydroxy Group," pt. 1, pp.83-124. Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, 1971; 2 Semmelhack and Hall. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 96, 7091, 7092 (1974); M. Fukui, Y.Endo and T. Oishi, Chem. Pharm. Bull.. 28, 3639 (1980);<br>

Among inactive halogenated aromatic compounds, in particular, chlorinated aromatic compounds have extremely low reactivity as compared to corresponding halogenated aromatic compounds of non-chlorinated series and no effective reaction agent or catalyst have been available .  However, because the above described chlorinated compounds are industrially producible and available at a low price, recently, various kinds of reaction agents and catalysts have been developed to achieve the nucleophilic substitution reaction of inactive chlorinated aromatic compounds. For example, in L. I. Goryunov and V. D. Shteingarts, Russ. J. Org. Chem., 29, 1849-1855 (1993), it is disclosed that using Rh complex, which is expensive and difficult to be industrially produced, as a catalyst and chlorobenzene as a raw material, methoxybenzene can be obtained in the yield of 60 to 75% by reacting the chlorobenzene at reaction temperature between 80°C and 180°C for 4 days to 1 hour.  In U.S. Pat. No. 5,315,043 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,543, it is disclosed that a specific fluorination reagent are reacted with chlorobenzene under very severe conditions of at a temperature between 210°C and 450°C to produce fluorobenzene in the yield of 6 to 70%.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an effective method to produce substituted aromatic compounds from halogenated aromatic compounds, especially chlorinated aromatic compounds, with high yield under mild reaction conditions by using reaction<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
reagents which are extremely effective to the nucleophilic substitution reaction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is a process for preparation of a substituted aromatic compound substituted with Q, which comprises: reacting a phosphazenium compound represented by formula (1)<br><br>
(in the formula,<br>
Q represents an anion in a form derived by elimination of a proton from an inorganic acid, or an active hydrogen compound having an active hydrogen on an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom or a sulfur atom;<br>
a, b, c and d, each independently, is 0 or 1, but all of them are not 0 simultaneously; and<br>
R groups represent the same or different hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or two Rs on each common nitrogen atom may be bonded together to form a ring structure) with a halogenated aromatic compound having halogen atoms;<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
whereby, at least one halogen atom in the halogenated aromatic compound is substituted with<br>
(where, Q represents an inorganic group or an organic group in a form derived by elimination of one electron from Q" in formula (1)).<br>
The present inventors have earnestly studied for the purpose of providing a method of industrially favorably producing substituted aromatic compounds, resulting in finding that the reactivity of various nucleophilic anion species represented by Q in formula (1) to the nucleophilic substitution reaction of aromatics is drastically improved by the use of a phosphazenium cation in formula (1) as a counter cation. The inventors found that with the use of phosphazenium compounds represented by formula (1) , the nucleophilic substitution reaction of inactive halogenated aromatic compounds, especially inactive chlorinated aromatic compounds, which had been conventionally considered to be difficult, could be progressed under extremely mild conditions and objective substituted aromatic compounds could be obtained in high yields.  As a result, the present invention is completed.<br>
To be concrete, for example, as shown in Example 1 and Example 2 to be described later, it has been found surprisingly that tetrakisttris (dimethylamino)<br>
phosphoranylideneamino]phosphonium methoxide: [ (Me2N)3P=N]4P+, MeC (Me represents methyl group in the formula and the following description) easily reacts with chlorobenzene at room temperature<br><br>
to produce desired methoxybenzene in the yield of 95%, and that when tetrakis[tris (dimethylamino)<br>
phosphoranylideneamino]phosphoniumfluoride: [ (Me2N)3P=N]4P+, F-is used, it reacts with chlorobenzene under an extremely mild condition of 130°C compared to the conventional condition to produce fluorobenzene in the yield of 81%.<br>
Further, in one aspect of the present invention, when a substitution reaction with Q- is carried out, a phosphazenium compound represented by formula (2)<br><br>
(in the formula, Z" is a halogen anion, and a, b, c, d and R groups are the same meaning as described above) and a metal compound represented by<br>
MQn<br>
(in the formula, M represents an alkaline metal atom, an alkaline earth metal atom, or a rare earth metal atom, Q is the same meaning as described above, and n is an integer from 1 to 3)<br>
-6-<br><br>
are used as raw materials and made contact with each other to produce a phosphazenium compound represented by the above described formula (1) in the reaction system, and thus the above described substitution reaction can be carried out.<br>
Brief Description of ACCOMPANY/Drawing<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the reaction rates of p-fluoronitrobenzene in Example 21 and Comparative examples 1 to 3.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Although phosphazenium compounds of formula (1) or (2) that are used in the present invention are representatively expressed by a canonical formula (that is, formula (1) or formula (2)) in which a positive charge of phosphazenium cation is localized on a central phosphorus atom, an infinite number of canonical formulas other than this formula can be depicted and positive charge is actually nonlocalized entirely.<br>

A halogenated aromatic compound to be used in the present invention is a compound having at least one halogen atom on the aromatic ring, and it is either an aromatic hydrocarbon compound or an aromatic heterocyclic compound.<br>
When a halogenated aromatic compound has a plurality of halogen atoms, it is sufficient that at least one of the atoms takes part in the substitution reaction to be substituted with Q. Moreover a hologenated compound may have Q from the beginning, in such a case, after halogen is substituted with Q in the present process, there will be obtained such a compound that the number of Q is further increased by one or more.<br>

As chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds, compounds that fluorine atoms of the above described fluorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds are replaced with chlorine atoms, dioxin and the like can be exemplified. As brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds and iodinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds, compounds that fluorine atoms of the above described fluorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds are replaced with bromine and iodine, respectively, can be exemplified.<br>
In the above, although only such compounds that have one kind of halogen atom in the same molecule were illustrated on the convenience of the classification, halogenated aromatic compounds in the present invention are not limited to these<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
illustrations , but may have 2 or more of different kinds of halogen atoms in the same molecule, and further these halogenated aromatic compounds can have any substituent, functional group, or heteroatom so long as the process of the present invention is impeded.<br>
These halogenated aromatic compounds are preferably the above described inactive fluorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, inactive chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, inactive brominated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, active fluorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, active chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, active brominated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds or brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds, and are more preferably inactive fluorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, inactive chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, inactive brominated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds , chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds or brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds . Further, inactive chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds or brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds are particularly preferred.<br>
In the present invention, when Q is a halogen, a halogen that participate in the exchange reaction in an halogenated aromatic compound to be used in the reaction must be one that exists in the lower part in the periodic table than Q.  That is, if Q- is F-, for example, a usable halogenated aromatic compound<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
is a halogenated aromatic compound having at least one of chlorine, bromine or iodine atom.<br>
Consequently, if Q" is F", halogenated aromatic compounds are selected from the above described inactive or active, chlorinated, brominated or iodinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and chlorinated, brominated or iodinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds and the like.  Inactive chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, inactive brominated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, active chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, active brominated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds and brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds are preferable, inactive chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds , inactive brominated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds and brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds are more preferable, and further inactive chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, chlorinated aromatic heterocyclic compounds or brominated aromatic heterocyclic compounds are still more preferable.<br>
The amount used of a phosphazenium compound represented by formula (1) is not especially limited, but the amount is usually 5 mol or less to 1 mol of the halogen atom to be substituted in a halogenated aromatic compound, and it is preferable to be 0.5 to 2 mol, and more preferable to be 0.8 to 1.2 mol.<br>
The reaction temperature is not necessarily definite, depending on the kinds of a phosphazenium compound represented<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
by formula (1) and a halogenated aromatic compound that are used, or of a solvent when used, but is usually 250°C or less, preferably 0 to 230°C, and more preferably 30 to 200°C. The pressure during the reaction is not necessarily definite, depending on the kinds of raw materials and others to be used, but is usually 3.0 MPa (absolute pressure and the same in the description below) or less, preferably 0.01 to 1.5 MPa, and more preferably 0.1 to 1.0 MPa. The reaction time is usually within 48 hours, preferably 0.01 to 30 hours, and more preferably 0.02 to 15 hours.<br>
Further, in one aspect of the present invention, when a substitution reaction with Q- is carried out, a phosphazenium compound represented by formula (2)<br><br>
(in the formula, Z" is a halogen anion, and a, b, c, d and R groups are the same meaning as described above) and a metal compound represented by MQn<br>
- 23 -<br><br>
(in the formula, M represents an alkaline metal atom, an alkaline earth metal atom, or a rare earth metal atom, Q is the same meaning as described above, and n is an integer from 1 to 3) are used as raw materials and made contact with each other to produce a phosphazenium compound represented by the above described formula (1) in the reaction system, and thus the above described substitution reaction can be carried out.<br>
Here, conditions, preferable conditions and others concerned with a, b, c, d and R groups of a phosphazenium compound represented by formula ( 2) are the same as the conditions required for a, b, c, d and R groups in the above described formula (1).<br>
Z~ is a halogen anion, for example, a fluorine anion, a chlorine anion, a bromine anion, an iodine anion or the like, and among them, a fluorine anion and chlorine anion are preferable, and a chlorine anion is more preferable.<br>
In this reaction, when Q- in [phosphazenium cation]+Q- of formula (1) that was produced in the reaction system is consumed by reacting with an halogenated aromatic compound, Q is supplied from MQn  Consequently, there is such an advantage that the amount used of [phosphazenium cation]+Z- of formula (2) is very little. Moreover, in the case where Z- is identical with Q-, when Z-( = Q") that has been fed previously is consumed, Q- is supplied from MQn, so there is also an advantageous effect even in the case where Z~ is identical with Q-.<br>
Two or more kinds of these phosphazenium compounds represented by formula (2) may be used together. Further, a<br>
- 24 -<br><br>
macrocyclic polyether (a crown ether and the like), a chain polyether, a quaternary ammonium salt, a quaternary phosphonium salt or the like, which have been conventionally used as catalysts, may be used together with these phosphazenium compounds represented by formula (2).<br>
M in metal compounds represented by MQn is a metal that can take the valence number up to trivalent.<br>
Examples include: alkaline metal atoms, including, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium or rubidium; alkaline earth metal atoms, including, for example, magnesium, calcium, strontium or barium; rare earth metal atoms, including, for example, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium or samarium. Among them, alkaline metal atoms, including, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium or rubidium are preferable, and sodium and potassium are more preferable.<br>
The n is an integer from 1 to 3, and is preferable to be 1.<br>
The amount used of a phosphazenium compound represented by formula (2) is not especially limited. However, the amount can be enough to be lower than the number of moles of a halogen atom to be substituted in a halogenated aromatic compound. Therefore, the amount is usually 1 mol or less per 1 mol of the halogen atom to be substituted, and it is preferable in the range of 0.001 to 0.2 mol, and more preferable in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 mol.<br>
Although the amount used of a metal compound MQn is not especially limited, the number of moles of exchangeable Q in MQn<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
(usually n pieces of them can be exchanged) is usually in the range of 0 . 5 to 4.0 mol per 1 mol of the halogen atom to be substituted in the halogenated aromatic compound. It is preferably in the range of 0.8 to 2.5 mol, and more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 1. 5 mol (the number of moles of MQn is 1/n of these figures. ) .<br>
The reaction temperature, the reaction pressure and the reaction time are the same as those when a phosphazenium compound of the above described formula (1) is used.<br>
In the present invention, a reaction can be carried out without the use of a solvent. But a solvent can be used, if necessary, to ensure the effective contact of a phosphazenium compound represented by formula (1) or formula (2) with a halogenated aromatic compounds and a metal compound represented by MQn in case it is present.<br>
In this case, a solvent to be used is not necessarily definite, depending on the kind or the amount of these compounds to be used, but any solvent may be used so long as it does not hinder the reaction. The examples of solvents include aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, including, for example, normal-pentane, normal-hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, tetralin, naphthalene, chlorobenzene, chlorotoluene, o-dichlorobenzene, 3,4-dichlorotoluene and 1-chloronaphthalene; ethers, including, for example, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and diphenyl ether; ketones, including, for example, acetone, methyl ethyl<br>
- 26 -<br><br>
ketone, diisopropyl ketone and benzophenone; tertiary amines, including, for example, tributylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine and quinoline; nitrocompounds, including, for example, nitromethane, nitroethane, nitrobenzene and o-nitrotoluene,* nitriles, including, for example, acetonitrile, propionitrile, 1,2-dicyanoethane and benzonitrile; aprotic polar solvents, including, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone, diphenyl sulfoxide, diphenyl sulfone, sulfolane, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and<br>
1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone.  These solvents may be used either alone or in a mixture of 2 or more kinds -<br>
In the process of the present invention, a method of isolating an objective substituted aromatic compound from the reaction mixture is not necessarily definite, depending on the kind of used raw materials, the kind of the objective aromatic substituted compound or the kind and amount of a used solvent. But normally, the objective aromatic substituted compound can be obtained from the reaction mixture solution, or in the case where a solvent was used, from the reaction mixture after the solvent has been removed, by the use of any method of extraction, distillation, recrystalization, column chromatography or the like.<br>
