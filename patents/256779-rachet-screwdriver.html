With further reference to Fig. 4, the ratchet (20) is mounted in the opening of the receiving chamber (111) and may comprise a driving sleeve (21), a rotating member (22), a teeth block (23), a heart-shaped spring (24), a drive<br><br>
selector (25) and a connector (26).<br>
The driving sleeve (21) has an inner surface, an outer surface, inner teeth (211) and two bosses (212). The inner teeth (211) are formed on the inner surface of the driving sleeve (21). The bosses (212) are formed on the outer surface of the driving sleeve (21), correspond respectively to, are mounted in and engage with the mounting recesses (113) of the body (11).<br>
The rotating member (22) is mounted in the driving sleeve (21) and has a disc (221), a keyed driving protrusion (222) and a rotating block (223). The disc (221) is mounted in the driving sleeve (21) and has an inner surface and an outer surface. The keyed driving protrusion (222) is formed on and protrudes from the inner surface of the disc (221) and may be quadrangular. The rotating block (223) is fomied on the outer surface of the disc (221), is substantially rectangular and has two longitudinal sides, an outer surface, a pivoting surface (2231) and a sliding surface (2232). The pivoting surface (2231) is formed on one longitudinal side of the rotating block (223) and faces the inner teeth (221) of the driving sleeve (21). The sliding surface (2232) is formed on the other longitudinal side of the rotating block (223).<br>
The teeth block (23) is mounted pivotally between the inner teeth (211) of the driving sleeve (21) and the pivoting surface (2231) of the rotating block (223) and has a curved surface, a rotating surface (232), an outer surface, multiple outer teeth (231) and an inserting hole (233). The curved surface coiTesponds to and engages the inner surface of the driving sleeve (21). The rotating surface (232) is opposite the curved surface and selectively engages the pivoting surface (2231) of the rotating block (223). The outer teeth (231) are<br><br>
formed on the curved surface of the teeth block (23), correspond to and selectively engage the inner teeth (211) of the driving sleeve (21). The inserting hole (233) is formed on the outer surface of the teeth block (23).<br>
The heart-shaped spring (24) is mounted on the teeth block (23) and abuts the outer surface of the rotating block (223) and has an inflection and two pivoting protrusions (241). The pivoting protrusions (241) are formed at the inflection and are mounted in the inserting hole (233) of the teeth block (23) to drive the teeth block (23). When the heart-shaped spring (24) is rotated, the teeth block (23) is also turned to engage the driving sleeve (21).<br>
The drive selector (25) is mounted rotatably on the rotating member (22), connected to the heart shaped spring (24), protrudes out from the opening of the receiving chamber (111) and the rear through hole (1221) of the cap (12) and has an inner surface and a sliding protrusion (252). The sliding protrusion (252) is formed on the inner surface of the drive selector (25), engages and drives the heart-shaped spring (24).<br>
The connector (26) is mounted through the drive selector (25) and is mounted in the rotating block (223) to hold the drive selector (25) rotatably on the rotating member (22).<br>
The shaft (30) is mounted rotatably in the body (11) and securely on the ratchet (20) and has a proximal end (32), a head (331), a keyed recess, a distal end (33), an outer surface and an optional ring mount (311). The ring mount (311) is defined in the outer surface of the shaft (30), is disposed outside the body (11) and may be a keyed surface, hole, recess or the like. The proximal end (32) of the shaft (30) is connected to the ratchet (20), maybe to the keyed driving protrusion<br><br>
(222) of the ratchet (20). The keyed recess is formed in the proximal end of the shaft (30) and corresponds to and engages the ratchet (20), maybe the keyed driving protrusion (222) of the ratchet (20). The head (331) is formed on the distal end (33) of the shaft (30) and may be slotted head, Philips head, a keyed socket head or the like. The keyed socket head allows various different screwdriver bits to be mounted securely on the keyed socket head.<br>
The fmger ring (40) is mounted securely around the shaft (30), is smaller than and mounted outside the body (11) and has an optional shaft mount (42). The shaft mount (42) is formed on the finger ring (40) corresponds to and engages the ring mount (311) of the shaft (30) to secure the finger ring (40) to the shaft (30). The shaft mount (42) may be a keyed surface, a bolt a clamp or the like.<br>
With reference to Figs. 2, 5 and 6, when the ratchet screwdriver is in use, the distal end (33) of the shaft (30) is connected to a corresponding fastener being a screw, nut, bolt or the like and the drive selector (25) is rotated to determine a drive direction. Then a user can rotate the handle (10) to tighten or loosen the fastener. When starting off tightening or finishing off loosening, very little torque is required to rotate the fastener, so the user can turn the shaft (30) by rotating the finger ring (40) with their fingers. Because the finger ring (40) is smaller and lighter than the body (11), the finger ring (40) can be spun quickly and efficiently, much faster and easier than rotating the handle (10). Therefore, the handle (10) need only be rotated to finish off tightening or start off loosening so saving time, energy and improving comfort of the user.<br>
