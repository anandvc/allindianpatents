				<td>FLEXIBLE DISPLAY SCREEN<br>
Field<br>
This invention relates to information displays, and more particularly to<br>
flexible information displays.<br>
Background<br>
	Individuals and corporations need information to function and do business<br>
in an information driven society. Increasingly, individuals and corporations are<br>
expressing a preference for receiving information in real time through portable<br>
electronic devices. Examples of portable electronic devices used to receive real<br>
time information include cellular telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants,<br>
geographical positioning systems, and palm size computers. Generally, these<br>
portable electronic devices have a small information display area. For example, a<br>
personal digital assistant typically has a flat panel display having an information<br>
display area of six or seven square centimeters. Many users of portable electronic<br>
devices would prefer a large information display area. Unfortunately, several<br>
problems arise when flat panel displays are scaled up and combined with portable<br>
electronic devices.<br>
As the display area of a flat panel display is increased, the surface area of<br>
the electronic device devoted to the display increases. Since portable electronic<br>
devices also include data entry features, such as input keys which utilize some of<br>
the surface area of the device, any increase in the surface area of the device<br>
devoted to the electronic display decreases the area available for data entry<br>
features. Since the trend in portable devices is to include more function in each<br>
device, it is undesirable to reduce the data entry features in a particular device in<br>
order to increase the area available for the display of information.<br>
A second problem with flat panel displays is that large flat panel displays<br>
consume a large amount of power. Increasing the area of the display increases the<br>
amount of power required to drive the display. For example, a flat panel display<br>
having 1000 pixels requires more power than a flat panel display having 100<br>
pixels. In addition, displays that rely on phosphorescent pixels require extra power<br>
to excite the phosphor in the pixels. Providing extra power to a display requires<br>
increasing the size of the power supply in the portable electronic device, which<br>
increases the size of the portable device. Since portable electronic devices are<br>
usually designed to fit in a shirt pocket, any increase in the volume of the devices<br>
decreases the portability of the devices.<br><br>
Therefore, scaling flat panel displays is not a good solution to the problem<br>
of increasing the display area of portable electronic devices.<br>
For these and other reasons there is a need for the present invention.<br>

Description<br>
In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments,<br>
reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in<br>
which is shown by way of illustration specific preferred embodiments in which the<br>
inventions may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail<br>
to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood<br>
that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical<br>
changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a<br>
limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the claims.<br>
A display is described herein which is flexible and includes pixels having a<br>
magnetically controllable reflectivity. The pixels are formed between a pair of<br>
flexible non-conductive sheets. Each pixel in the display includes a flexible ring<br>
that contributes to the flexibility of the display. Each of the pixels also includes<br>
magnetic particles whose location within the pixel determines the reflectivity of the<br>
pixel. The display, which is described in more detail below, is especially suitable<br>
for use in connection with portable electronic devices.<br>
Figure I is an illustration of an example embodiment of information<br>
processing unit 101 including electronic device 103, display 105. and take-up bar<br><br>
107. Take-up bar 107 is connected to electronic device 103, and display 105 wraps<br>
around take-up bar 107. Display 105 is a flexible display capable of being unrolled<br>
from take-up bar 107 for viewing. Display 105 is electrically coupled to electronic<br>
device 103 and is capable of receiving information from electronic device 103 for<br>
display. In operation, information is provided to display 105 by electronic device<br>
103 and is viewable after display 103 is extended from take-up bar 107. Packaging<br>
flexible display 105 on take-up bar 107 permits electronic device 103 to have both<br>
a compact housing and a large display area. A large display area is especially<br>
useful in connection with devices used to view e-mail.<br>
Electronic device 103 is not limited to a particular type of electronic device.<br>
Any device capable of providing information to display device 105 is suitable for<br>
use in connection with the present invention. In one embodiment, electronic<br>
device 103 is a cellular telephone. In an alternate embodiment, electronic device<br>
103 is a personal digital assistant. In another alternate embodiment, electronic<br>
device 103 is a calculator. In still another alternate embodiment, electronic device<br>
103 is a geographical positioning system. In another alternate embodiment,<br>
electronic device 103 is a palm size computing device. In yet another alternate<br>
embodiment, electronic device 103 is a portable web browser.<br>
Figure 2A is an illustration of a front view of an example embodiment of<br>
display 105. Display 105, in one embodiment, includes a pair of flexible sheets<br>
201 comprising first flexible sheet 203 and second flexible sheet 205. Display 105<br>
also includes pixels 207 located in pixel layer 208 between the pair of flexible<br>
sheets 201.<br>
Flexible sheets 203 and 205 are preferably fabricated from a flexible<br>
dielectric material. For example, in one embodiment, flexible sheets 203 and 205<br>
are fabricated from thin sheets of polyamide. Each one of the pair of flexible<br>
sheets 201 has a thickness that allows the pair of flexible sheets 201 to be flexible<br>
in a particular application. For example, for a display 105 suitable for use with a<br>
hand held device in which flexible sheets 203 and 205 are fabricated from<br>
polyamide, the thickness of each of the pair of flexible sheets 201 is between about<br>
25 micrometers and about 125 micrometers. A thickness of less than 25<br>
micrometers may not provide sufficient structure to ensure long lifetime for<br>
flexible sheets 203 and 205. A thickness of more than about 125 micrometers may<br>
not allow for sufficient flexibility in the pair of flexible sheets 201. At least a<br>
portion of one of the pair of dielectric sheets 201 is translucent. A translucent<br>
sheet permits displaying information as pixels by reflecting light from a material at<br>
the back surface of one of the pair of dielectric sheets 201.<br><br>
Pixel layer 208. in one embodiment, is fabricated as a single sheet from a<br>
flexible material having a number of holes corresponding to the location of pixels<br>
207. The inner surface of each of the number of holes in one embodiment form a<br>
cylinder. Alternatively, the inner surface of each of the number of holes form a<br>
frustrum. The flexibility of pixel layer 208 is improved by having the inner surface<br>
of the number of holes form a frustrum. Pixel layer 208 may be manufactured<br>
using an injection molding process. Prior to the molding operation, a mold for a<br>
sheet having a number of holes is fabricated. Pixel layer 208 is produced by<br>
injecting a material, such as capton, into the mold using an injection molding<br>
machine. Fabrication of the present invention is not limited to an injection<br>
molding process. Am process capable of producing a flexible pixel layer 208 is<br>
also suitable for use in connection with the present invention.<br>
Pixels 207 are arranged in pixel layer 208 between first flexible sheet 203<br>
and second flexible sheet 205 to form an information display area. In one<br>
embodiment, pixels 207 are arranged in rows and columns to form a rectangular<br>
information display area. A rectangular information display area may be mapped<br>
to an array data structure, which simplifies the tracking of the state of the<br>
individual pixels in the information display area. In one embodiment, each of the<br>
pixels 207 in the information display area, is individually controllable or<br>
addressable and may assume an "on" state or an "off" state. In the "off" state,<br>
pixels 207 assumes a first image shade. In the "on", state pixels 207 assume a<br>
second image shade that differs from, and preferably contrasts with, the first image<br>
shade. In one embodiment, the first image shade is while and the second image<br>
shade is black.<br>
In operation, pixels 207 are turned "on" and "off to form images. For<br>
example, eight pixels 207 are turned "on" to form square 209 in display 105. In<br>
another example, seven pixels 207 are turned "on" to form the letter "I" 21 1 in<br>
display 105.<br>
Figure 2B is an illustration of a back view of an example embodiment of<br>
the flexible display shown in Figure 2A. In this example embodiment, both first<br>
flexible sheet 203 and second flexible sheet 205 are translucent. As can be seen by<br>
comparing Figure 2A with Figure 2B, for a pair sheets 201 that are both<br>
translucent, a negative image of the information displayed in Figure 2A is<br>
displayed in Figure 2B.<br>
Figure 2C is an illustration of a cross-sectional side view of an example<br>
embodiment of the flexible display shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2B. Pixel la\er<br>
208. including pixels 207, is formed between the pair of flexible sheets 201. Each<br><br>
of the pixels 207 includes a conductive trace 213, a non-conductive ring 215, a<br>
second conductive trace 217, and magnetic particles 219. Conductive traces 213<br>
and 217 are formed on flexible sheets 203 and 205. Non-conductive ring 215 fits<br>
between flexible sheets 203 and 205 and is aligned with conductive traces 213 and<br>
217. Non-conductive ring 215. in cooperation with flexible sheets 203 and 205,<br>
encapsulates magnetic particles 219, and forms a flexible display 105.<br>
Conductive traces 213 and 21 7 are fabricated from conductive materials<br>
such as copper, aluminum, silver or gold or alloys of copper, aluminum, silver or<br>
gold. To fabricate conductive traces 213 and 217 a layer of conductive material is<br>
formed on the surface of flexible sheets 203 and 205. The conductive material is<br>
patterned and etched to leave conductive traces 213 and 217. The shape of<br>
conductive traces 213 and 217 are selected for ease of fabrication and packing<br>
density. In one embodiment, traces 213 and 217 have a circular shape. A circular<br>
shape is easily fabricated, and the corresponding non-conductive ring 215 which<br>
preferably matches the shape of traces 213 and 217 is also easily fabricated as a<br>
circular cylinder. In an alternate embodiment, conductive traces 213 and 217 have<br>
a hexagonal shape. Conductive traces 213 and 217 have a cross-sectional area<br>
sufficient to support a current, without excessive healing, that produces a magnetic<br>
field capable of forcing magnetic particles 219 away from the surface on which the<br>
conductive trace is formed.<br>
Non-conductive ring 215 separates flexible sheet 201 from flexible sheet<br>
203 and encloses magnetic particles 219. The flexibility of non-conductive ring<br>
215 affects the flexibility of flexible sheet 203, so non-conductive ring 215 is<br>
preferably fabricated from a flexible material. In one embodiment, non-conductive<br>
ring 215 is fabricated from capton. The height of non-conductive ring 215 is<br>
selected to allow for contrast between an "on" state and an "off state in pixels 207.<br>
The wall thickness of non-conductive ring 215 is selected to provided structural<br>
integrity for the projected life of the flexible display. In fabricating flexible sheet<br>
203, non-conductive ring 215 is generally aligned with conductive traces 213 and<br>
217, and preferably, the centerline of non-conductive ring 215 is aligned with the<br>
centerline of conductive traces 213 and 217.<br>
Magnetic particles 219 provide a medium for changing the state of pixels<br>
207 by reflecting light from the back surface of first flexible sheet 203 for a pixel<br>
in the "on" slate. Therefore, magnetic particles 219 are preferably fabricated from<br>
a reflective material Magnetic particles 219 are also capable of responding to a<br>
magnetic field, so magnetic panicles 219 are fabricated from a magnetic material.<br>
In one embodiment, magnetic particles 219 are fabricated from iron. Magnetic<br><br>
particles 219, in one embodiment are iron shavings. In an alternate embodiment,<br>
magnetic particles 219 are powdered iron. To turn pixels 207 "on" magnetic<br>
panicles 219 are forced to the back surface of flexible sheet 203. To turn pixels<br>
207 "off magnetic particles 219 are forced to the back surface of flexible sheet<br>
205.<br>
Figures 3A and 3B are illustrations of example embodiments of an<br>
exploded view of pixel 207 in the "off" state and the "on" state, respectively. Pixel<br>
207 includes conductive traces 213 and 217 formed on the pair of flexible sheets<br>
201. Non-conductive ring 215 is located between the pair of flexible sheets 201.<br>
Magnetic panicles 219 are enclosed between non-conductive ring 215 and the pair<br>
of sheets 201. Figure 3A also shows magnetic field lines 301 for current 303<br>
flowing in conductive trace 213. The magnetic filed associated with magnetic field<br>
lines 301 pin magnetic panicles 219 at the inner surface of flexible sheet 205. For<br>
magnetic panicles 219 pinned at the inner surface of flexible sheet 205, light<br>
entering pixel 207 at flexible sheet 203 is not reflected from the back surface of<br>
flexible sheet 203 and pixel 207 appears dark. Figure 3B shows magnetic field<br>
lines 307 for current 309 in conductive trace 217. The magnetic field associated<br>
with magnetic field lines 307 pin magnetic particles 219 at the inner surface of<br>
flexible sheet 203. For magnetic panicles 219 pinned at the inner surface of<br>
flexible sheet 203 light entering pixel 207 at flexible sheet 203 is reflected from the<br>
back surface of flexible sheet 203 and pixel 207 appears light.<br>
A display and a method of fabricating a display has been described herein.<br>

rows to form a rectangular information display area.<br>
28.	The flexible display screen as claimed in claim 27, wherein each of the number of pixels is<br>
individually controllable to assume an on state or an off state.<br><br>
A display includes pixels (207) having a magnetically controllable reflectivity.<br>
The pixels (207) are formed between a pair of flexible non-conductive sheets (201).<br>
Each of the magnetically controllable pixels (207) includes a flexible ring located<br>
between the flexible non-conductive sheets (201). Each of the magnetically controllable<br>
pixels (207) also includes magnetic particles (219) located within the flexible ring. The<br>
location of the magnetic particles (219) with respect to the flexible non-conductive<br>
sheets (201) determines the reflectivity of the pixel (207). The display is especially<br>
suitable for use in connection with portable electronic devices.</td>
