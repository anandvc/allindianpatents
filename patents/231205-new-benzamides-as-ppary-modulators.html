New benzamides as PPARy modulators<br>
The present invention relates to new benzamides acting as PPARy and PPARy /PPAR5 modulators, as well as to processes and intermediates useful for their preparation, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the superfamily of transcription factors known' as nuclear receptors. This family includes steroid, retinoid and thyroid hormone  receptors.  Three  sub-types  of  PPARs  have  been<br>
identified in humans, rodents and Xenopus.   They are PPARa,<br>
PPARp/8 and PPARy, each encoded by a different gene and showing different tissue distribution.<br>
The gene encoding for PPARy is transcribed in humans in three<br>
different mRNA isoforms (PPARyl, PPARy2 and PPARy3) through different splicing and promoter usage (Fajas et al., J Biol. Chem.    1997, 272,    18779-18789) . The PPARyl isoform shows a wide tissular distribution,  while PPARy2 and PPARy3 are confined to certain tissues: PPARy2 is expressed only in<br>
adipose tissue and PPARy3 in adipose tissue as well as in macrophages (Fajas et al., FEBS Lett.   1998, 438,   55-60).<br>
Differences detected in tissue distribution as well as in the activation profile of the PPARy isoforms suggest they are involved in a variety of physiological functions playing a central role in homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Vamecq et al., Lancet 1999, 354,   141-148). These functions include, for<br><br>
example, lipidic transport in plasma and catabolism of fatty acids, regulation of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels,   differentiation   of   macrophages   that   form atherosclerotic     plaques,     inflammatory     response, carcinogenesis, hyperplasia, and adipocyte differentiation,<br>
the latter being the most verified function of the PPARy (Grimaldi, Prog. Lipid Res. 2001, 40, 269-281, Schiller et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 14133-14137) . Thus, the discovery of these transcription factors has provided new pharmacological targets for the development of useful therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of metabolic ' diseases such as diabetes, obesity and dyslipidaefnia.<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or type 2 diabetes is characterized by an insulin resistance in peripheral tissues,  including muscle, liver, and adipose •<br>
tissue. Glitazones, selective PPARy agonist compounds, are drugs that reduce insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels. Currently two products belonging to this family, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in humans.<br>
A great effort has been made in recent years to design new drugs that improve the side effect profile of the first<br>
glitazones, show a greater affinity as a PPARy ligands, and increase their potency in type 2 diabetes. This rational design has yielded structurally diverse compounds that show great potency and selectivity. Among them is interesting to highl ight the 2 - alkoxyphenylpropionic type derivatives ragaglitazar  (1,  EP  1049684)  and  tesaglitazar  (2,  EP<br><br>
1084103) . These compounds are currently in phase III and II of clinical development, respectively.<br><br>
The use of compounds totally or partially blocking PPARy activity is useful for the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, which constitutes an effective treatment for obesity.<br>
PPAR5 activation has been shown to lead to increased levels of HDL cholesterol in db/db mice (Leibowitz et al, FEBS Lett. 2000, 473, 333-336), and in diabetic-obese rhesus monkeys, while lowering the levels of LDL, triglycerides, and insulin (Oliver et al, Proc Nat Acad Sci   USA,   2001, 98,<br>
5306-5311) . The involvement of PPAR8 in fatty acid oxidation<br>
in muscles was further substained in PPARct knock-out mice (Muoio et al.,    J.    Biol.    Chem.    2002, 277,    26089-26097). A<br>
number of PPAR5 compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (e.g. WO 02/59098, WO 01/603, WO 01/25181, WO 02/14291, WO 01/79197, WO 99/4815, WO 97/28149, WO 98/27974, WO 97/28115, WO 97/27857, WO 97/28137, WO 97/27847) . Taken together, these observations suggest that PPAR8 activation is useful in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and conditions including atherosclerosis, hypertriglyceremia and mixed dyslipidemia<br><br>
(WO 01/00603) In vitro studies investigating the pharmacological modulation of PPAB.5 suggest that this kind of ligands may prove to be efficacious drugs for decreasing cardiovascular disease associated with metabolic syndrome, a condition comprised of a cluster of risk factors that also includes  insulin  resistance,  obesity  and  hypertension<br>
(Mukjerheer, Drug News Perspect.   2002, 15,   261-267).<br>
Pro-differentiation and lipid accumulation effects have been reported in rodent and cultured human keratinocytes, as well<br>
as protection against cell death upon PPAR8 activation (Tan et al., Genes Dev. 2001, 15, 3263-3277; Schmuth et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004, 122, 971-983). Modulators of these activities could be useful for treating a variety of skin disorders.<br>
In addition, PPAR5 has been implicated as a direct target in colorectal carcinogenesis in mice. All the evidences suggest<br>
that PPAR8 expression may promote tumour growth and, thus, may be also a potential target for the treatment of colorectal cancer (e.g. Park et al., Prod Nat Acad Sci USA, 2001, 98,   2598-2603). While PPARy is acknowledged as a master<br>
regulator of adipogenesis, PPAR8 may also play a role in adipocyte differentiation, as demonstrated by in vitro and in PPARS- deficient animals, promoting PPARy gene expression, which upon specific ligand activation promotes adipogenesis. Thus a non-selective PPARy/5 antagonist would be also a potential drug for obesity (Shearer et al., Curr. Med. Chem. 2003, 10,   267-280).<br>
This indicate that research for compounds displaying various degrees of PPARy and PPAR8 modulation should lead to the<br><br>
discovery of drugs that have great potential in the treatment of diseases such as type-2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, syndrome X, cardiovascular diseases (including atherosclerosis), hypercholesteremia, colon cancer, skin disorders (including psoriasis, and wound healing, Tan et a.1., Expert Opin. Ther. Targets, 2004, 8, 39) , and bone diseases (Pei et al.t   J.   Clin.   Invest.,   2004, 113,   805-806).<br>
Consequently, it is of great interest to provide new therapeutic agents that selectively modulate PPARy, and PPARy / PPARS.<br>
Kundu and collaborators have described benzamides/(3) , (4) and (5) as/w-D-glucosidase /inhibitors (Comb. JChem. High. 2002, 5,/545-550) . These compounds are structurally close to those/of this invent ioz^, but were described for different uses.<br><br>
Kundu and collaborators have described benzamides (3) , (4) and (5) as N-D-glucosidase inhibitors (Comb. Chem. High. 2002, 5, 545-550). WO 02/096426 disclose compounds (6) and (7) as intermediates for compounds which are matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. Finally, WO 04/014844 disclose compounds  (8)  and  (9)  as  factor IX modulators.  These<br><br>
compounds are structurally close to those of this invention but were described for different uses.<br><br>

Some of the compounds of general formula (I) may exhibit polymorphism, encompassing the present invention all the possible polymorphic forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compounds of general structure (I) may be prepared following various processes perfectly known by any skill person in the field of organic synthesis. Compounds of the present invention may be synthesized using the methods described below, as- well as other processes known in the field of organic synthesis. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, the general processes shown in the attached schemes.<br><br><br>
According to a first method (Method A) , the phenolic acid (II) is treated with the amine derivative (III)  in the presence of.' a suitable coupling agent,  for example the combination of 1- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) -3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC)  and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole  (HOBT) ,  or with thionyl chloride  in  the presence of  a  tertiary base such as triethylamine (Elmore, Amino  Acids   Pep.    Proteins   2001, 32, 107-162) . Final compounds (la) are obtained by Williamson etherif ication by displacement of a leaving group (LG) bonded to a type -Z radical with the phenol (IV) (using for example NaH, K2C03 or CS2CO3 as a base in a solvent such as DMF or acetone;  (Bal-Tembe et al., Bioorg.    Med.     Chem.    1997,  5, 1381-1388;  Cantello  et  al.,  J*. Med.      Chem.      1994,  37, 3977-3985, Solar et al,, J   .Org.    Chem.   1966,   31,   1996-1997; EP.875510), or by Mitsunobu reaction between (IV) and a Z-OH type alcohol in the presence of,  for example,  diethyl azodicarboxylate   (DEAD)   and   triphenylphosphine   in tetrahydrofurane as a solvent (Mitsunobu, Synthesis  1981, 1; Hughes, Org.   React.   1992, 42,   335) .<br><br><br>
An alternative strategy (Method B) involves prior alkylation of the phenolic esters (V) . After basic hydrolysis of the resulting ester, the final compounds (I) are synthesized by reaction with the amine derivative (III) . Alternatively, and only in the specific case of para substitution of the aromatic ring, the phenolic ether (VT) may be formed by aromatic nucleophilic substitution starting from the f luorinated compound (VII) .<br>
When -Z is a radical of the - (CH2) S-X-P-I-J-T type where X is 0 or S, for the alkylation of the phenol another alternative procedure may be followed (Method C) .<br><br><br>
The phenol (IV) or (V) is treated with the suitable doubl; functionalised alkylidene derivative (EP 875510) and, then, -nucleophilic substitution reaction with the desired alcoho! or thiol is carried out to obtain the compounds (Iaa) , an (lab) or the esters (Xa) and (XIa) , depending on the initia phenol. The hydrolysis of* the esters (Xa) and (XIa) and thei: subsequent reaction with the amine derivative (III) als leads to the compounds (Iaa) and (lab) . The derivatives o<br><br>
the sulphoxide (lac) and sulphone (lad) types are obtained by oxidation of the' corresponding thioether (lab) in the presence of oxidizing agents such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide or m-chloroperbenzoic acid.<br><br><br><br>
When -Z is a radical of the - (CH2) S-NR4-P-I-J-T type, the amines (Iae) may be obtained starting from the phenols (IV) or (V) following two alternative alkylation routes in every case (Method D) . In the case of phenol (IV) , the reaction with a doubly functionalised alkylidene derivative and, then, the nucleophilic substitution with the desired amines; or the etherification with the protected amine compound (XII) (as a trifluoroacetamide derivative, for example) , and subsequent functionalisation  of  the  amine  released  after  its deprotection (in a basic medium, or with NaBH4 (Harland and Hodge Synthesis  1984, 941-943)) yields the desired compounds. The tertiary amines of the (Iaeb)  and (Iaec) types are obtained by the treatement of the compound  (Iaea) with alkylating agents or by reductive alkylation, respectively. The amides  (laed)  are synthesized by acylation of the compound (Iaea) with the corresponding acid derivative in the presence of a tertiary amine, or by treating the secondary amine with an acid in the presence of a coupling agent such as, for example the combination of EDC and HOBT (Elmore, Amino Acids  Pep.   Proteins  2001, 32,   107-162) . In the case of the phenol (V), the amines (Iae) are obtained by reaction of their precursor acids (XVIb) , (XVTIb) and (XVTIIb) with the amine derivatives (III) following the methods outlined above. These acids, in turn, are obtained from the phenol  (V) following an analogous process to that used in the case of the phenol (IV) .<br>
The Z-OH or Z-LG type compounds are products that have already been described. Some of them are commercially available or may be prepared following methods analogous to those used to synthesize others that are already known, such as those that are explained in detail in the following documents: EP 03062228; WO 97/31907; WO 01/00603; Daoud et<br><br>
al., J.    Indian   Chem.   Soc.   1989, 66,    316-318 and Aquino, J*. . Med.    Chem.    1996, 39,    562-569,    some of them summarised in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Some of the  compounds  (III)  are commercially available<br>
products, particularly when they are a-amino acids. Others have already been described or may be synthesized following various routes, most of which have been described (March, Advanced   Organic    Chemistry,    1991, Ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons;<br>
Juaristi, Enantioselective Synthesis of fi-Amino Acids, 1997, Ed. Wiley-VDH) .<br>
An approach for the preparation of the a-amino acids (W is -NH-CH(E)-) is the Sorensen synthesis (Mori, Tetrahedron 1985,     2369-2377;    Scheme    2) ,    wherein    dialkyl<br><br>
acyl-amide-malonate is alkylated in a basic medium and, after subsequent  hydrolysis  and  decarboxylation,  the  desired<br>
oc-amino acids (Ilia) are obtained. Scheme 2<br><br>
N-Substituted glycines and β-alanines (W is -N(E)-CH2- or -N(D)-CH2-CH2-) may be synthesized by the methods shown bellow, either' by reductive amination of the corresponding glycine or alanine with the suitable aldehyde (Scheme 3) using reducing agents such as NaBH4/ NaBH3CN or NaBH(AcO)3, or by nucleophilic substitution of the esters (XX) or (XXI) with the suitable amine (Scheme 4) ,<br>
Scheme 3<br><br><br>
Scheme 4<br><br>
An alternative process for the synthesis of β-alanines (III) would be; the addition of the corresponding amine to the<br>
a,β-unsaturated ester of interest (Scheme 5) Scheme 5<br><br>
Conversion of a compound of formula (I) into a different one involves transforming the -CO-A group into a different group. The modifications considered are: the hydrolysis of the -C00R1 substituent, wherein -Rl represents a - (C1-C4) -alkyl moiety, to yield the corresponding' carboxylic acid; the esterification of the carboxylic acids (lb) with the RIOH alcohols; and, lastly, the amination of the -COOR1 group to obtain the corresponding amides. The hydrolysis methods used are the usual ones, for example, using an alkaline hydroxide<br><br>
in  aqueous  methanol.  The  amination  and  esterification processes are those commonly used (Scheme 6) .<br>

Assay of binding to the PPARy2<br>
The cDNA encoding for the open reading frame of the hPPARy2 is amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and inserted in the plasmid pGEX-4T-2. This construction (pGEX-hPPARy) is introduced into E. coli where it is overexpressed and semipurified  as  a  fusion  protein  with  glutathione<br><br>
S-transferase (GST)  (Elbrecht et al., J.    Biol.    Cham.    1999, 274,   7913-7922) .<br>
The binding of the compounds to the GST-hPPARy2 s is determined by modifications in the method described by Lehmann et al. (J". Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 12953-12957). The receptors (2.5 /xg) were incubated in 96-well plates in the presence or in the absence of the products with [3H]BRL-49853 (100 nM) for 3 h at 4°C, in a final volume of 200 /zL of buffer Tris-HCl 10 mM pH:8.0, containing KC1 50 mM and DTT 10 mM. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of BRL-49853 100 /xM. The reaction mixture was transferred to a Multiscreen Durapore (Millipore) microplate containing glutathione-Sepharose 4B in every well. The reaction mixture was left to incubate with the resin during 10 min, and then centrifuged at 735 g during 2 min. To dissociate the receptor bound to the resin, reduced glutathione 10 mM is added and incubated during 10 min. The receptor was elut ed by centrifugation. Then, 800 piL of scintillation liquid were added to - the elution and the contained radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (Microbeta Wallac, Perkin Elmer).<br>
LBD-hPPARs transactivation assay<br>
COS-7 cells were cultivated in 24-well plates and transfected with the pFACMV plasmids that encode the chimeric proteins<br>
containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to the PPARy LBD. The reporter plasmid for the foregoing constructions was pFR-Luc, which contains five repetitions of the GAL4-response element in front of a promoter that controls the transcription of the luciferase gene. Lipofectamine was used as a transfection agent.<br><br>
The plasmids of the chimeric receptors and the reporter gene were inserted in the cells by transitory transfection in COS-7 cells in culture. When the products were added to the culture for 48 h, the luciferase activity showed the effect of the PPAR activity modulation on the transcription of the reporter construction (Wright et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 1873) .<br>
Cloning of human PPARoc, PPARS and PPARy2<br>
The human PPARs cDNAs were amplified through RT-PCR* For hPPARct,  RNA was obtained from HepG2 cells treated with<br>
linoleic acid; for h PPARS, KNA was obtained from untreated HepG2 cells; for hPPARy2, RNA was obtained from human white adipose tissue. Each amplified fragment was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene®) and sequenced. One clone for each construction was selected and used as template for further subcloning and PCR amplifications.<br>
GST-fused protein construction<br>
To generate these chimeric proteins, the complete cDNA of the four human PPARs were cloned into pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) . The fragment was obtained from the pBluescript-cDNAs clones digested with endonucleases. To assess the plasmid identity and to ensure the in-phase cloning of the proteins, pGEXs constructions were sequenced. GST-hPPARy2, GST-hPPARct or GST-h PPARS fusion proteins were generated in Escherichia coli (BL21 strain DE3). Cells were cultured in LB medium to a density of A600= 1.6 odu# and induced    for    overexpression    by    addition    of<br>
isopropyi~l-thio-|3-D-galactopyranoside        (IPTG) -induced<br><br>
cultures to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The IPTG-induced cultures were grown at room temperature o/n, before cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min. After sonication, the GST-fusion proteins were purified from the cell pellet using glutathione-Sepharose beads, following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Excess of gluthatione was removed o/n by dyalisis at 4°C. Receptor purity was visualized by SDS-PAGE and protein content was determined by Bradford method* Receptor aliquots were stored at -80°C until use.<br>
GST-hPPARg and GST-hPPAR5 binding<br>
Using 96-well culture plates, PPARa or PPAR8 (5 μg) were diluted to a total volume of 100 μL with buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES (pH:7.0), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA andlO mM DTT, in the presence of [3H] -GW2433 (100 and 50 nM for PPARa and<br>
PPAR5, respectively) . Nonspecific binding was estimated in parallel incubations containing 50 /xM of GW-2433. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Free radioligand was separated from receptor-bound ligand by size exclusion chromatography using. Sephadex G-25 in 96-wells spin plates, using the Multiscreen Column Loader (Millipore). Eluted radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in a Microbeta counter (Perkin Elmer).<br>
