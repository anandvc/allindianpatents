THERAPEUTIC AGENTS USEFUL FOR TRE.\TING PAJN<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/391.962, filed Jxme 28, 2002; U.S. Provisional Apphcation No. 60/411,030, filed September 17, 2002; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/413,148, filed September 25, 2002; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/416,582, filed October S, 2002, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound and methods for treating or preventing pain, urinary incontinence (UT), an ulcer, inflanunatory-bowel disease (IBD), irritable-bowel syndrome (IBS), an addictive disorder, Parkinson's disease, parkinsonism, anxiety, epilepsy, stroke, a seizure, a pruritic condition, psychosis, a cognitive disorder, a memory deficit, restricted brain function, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia, retinopathy, a muscle spasm, a migraine, vomiting, dyskinesia or depression, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound.<br>
2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pam is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, fonctional ability and overall quality of life (KM. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107 (J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996)).<br>
Moreover, chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the peripheral or cental nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. There is a large body of evidence relating activity at both Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, i.e., metabotiopic glutamate receptor 1 ("mGluRl") and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5<br><br>
("mGIuRS") (M.E. Fundyms, CNSDntgs 15:29-58 (2001)), and vanilloid receptors ("VRl") (V. Di Marzo st al. Current Opinion in Neurobiology 12:372-379 (2002)) to pain processing. Inhibiting mGluRl or mGluR5 reduces pain, as shown by in vivo treatment with antibodies selective for either mGIuRl or mGluR5, where neuropathic pain in rats was attenuated (M.E. Fundytus et al, NeuroRepon 9:731-735 (1998)). It has also been shown that antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of mGluRl alleviates both neuropathic and inflammatory pain (M.E. Fundyms et al, British Journal of Pharmacology 132:354-367 (2001); M.E. Fundyms et al., Phannacohgy, Biochemsitiy &amp; SeAav/o/-73:401-410 (2002)). Small molecule antagonists for mOluRS-attenuated pain in in vivo animal models are disclosed in, e.g., K. Walker et al. Neiirophamiacology 40:1-9 {2000) and A. X&gt;o^ra\ et al, Neuroscience Letters 292:115-118(2000)).<br>
Nociceptive pain has been traditionally managed by administering non-opioid analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal, and naproxen; or opioid analgesics, including morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levoiphanoi, fentanyl, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Id. In addition to ^e above-listed treatments, neuropathic pain, which can be difficult to treat, has also been treated with anii-epileptics (e.g. gabapentin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiiamate, phenytoin), NMDA antagonists (e.g. ketamine, dextromethorphan), topical Udocaine (for post-herpetic neuralgia), and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline and amitriptyline).<br>
UI is uncontrollable urination, generally caused bybladder-detrusor-muscle nstability. UI affects people of all ages and levels of physical health, both in health care -.ettings and in the community at large. At present, UI aSlicts 15-30% of elderlypeople iving at home, one-third of those living in acute-care settings, and at least one-half of those iving in long-term care instimtions (R.M. Resnick, Lancet 346:94 (1995)). Persons having jl are predisposed to also having urinary-tract infections, pressure ulcers, perineal rashes and irosepsis. Psychosocially, UI is associated with embanassment, social stigmatization, .epression and a risk of instimtionalization (Herao et al, Annu. Rev. Gerontol. Geriatr. 9:74 1989)). Economically, the costs of UI are great; in the United States alone, health-care costs ssociated with UI are over S15 biUion per annum.<br><br>
Physiologic bladder contraction results in large part from acetylcholine-induced stimulation of post-ganglionic muscarinic-receptor sites on bladder smooth muscle. Treatments for UI include the administration of drugs having bladder-relaxant properties, which help to control bladder-detrusor-muscle overactivity. For example, anticholinergics<br>
5 such as propantheline bromide and glycopyrrolate. and combinations of smooth-muscle relaxants such as a combination of racemic oxybutynin and dicyclomine or an anticholinergic, have been used to treat UI (See, e.g., A.J. Wein, Urol Clin. N. Am. 22:557-577 (1995); Levin et al.,J. Urol 128:396-398 (19S2); Cooke el ai, S. Afi: Med. J. 63:3 (19S3); R.K. Mirakhur et ai. Anaesthesia 38:1195-1204 (19S3)). These drugs are not effective, however, in all<br>
0 patients having umnhibited bladder contractions. Administration of anticholinergic medications represent the mainstay of this type of treatment.<br>
None of the existing commercial drug treatments for UI, however, has achieved complete success in all classes of UI patients, nor has treatment occurred without significant adverse side effects. For example, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred<br>
) vision, headaches, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmia, which are related to the<br>
anticholinergic activity of traditional anti-UI drugs, can occur frequently and adversely affect<br>
patient compliance. Yet despite the prevalence of unwanted anticholinergic effects in many<br>
patients, anticholinergic drugs are currently prescribed for patients having UL 77ie Merck<br>
Manual of Medical Information 631-634 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
'	Ulcers are sores occurring where the lining of the digestive tract has been<br>
eroded by stomach acids or digestive juices. The sores are typically well-defined round or oval lesions primarily occurring in the stomach and duodenum. About 1 in lO people develop an ulcer. Ulcers develop as a result of an imbalance between acid-secretory factors, also known as "aggressive factors," such as stomach acid, pepsin, and Helicobacter pylori infection, and local mucosal-protective factors, such as secretion of bicarbonate, mucus, and prostaglandins.<br>
Treatment of ulcers typically involves reducing or inhibiting the aggressive factors. For example, antacids such as al\miinum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium bicarbonate can be used to neutralize stomach acids. Antacids, however, can cause alkalosis, leading to nausea, headache, and weakness. Antacids can also interfere with the absorption of other drugs into the blood stream and cause diarrhea.<br><br>
HT antagonists, such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine, are also used to treat ulcers. H2 antagonists promote ulcer healing by reducing gastric acid and digestive-enzyme secretion elicited by histamine and other H. agonists in the stomach and duodenum. H, antagonists, however, can cause breast enlargement and impotence in men mental changes (especially LQ the elderly), headache, dizziness, nausea, myalgia, diarrhea, rash, and fever.<br>
H, K"^ - ATPase inhibitors such as omeprazole and lansoprazole are also used to treat ulcers. IT, K* - ATPase inhibitors inhibit the production of enzymes used by the stomach to secrete acid. Side effects associated witli H*, K* - ATPase inhibitors include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal colic, headache, dizziness, somnolence, skin rashes, and transient elevations of plasma activities of aminotransferases.<br>
Sucraflate is also used to treat ulcers. Sucraflate adheres to epithelial cells and is believed to form a protective coating at the base of an ulcer to promote healing. Sucraflate, however, can cause constipation, dry mouth, and interfere with the absorption of other drugs.<br>
Antibiotics are used when Helicobacter pylori is the underlying cause of the ulcer. Often antibiotic therapy is coupled with the administration of bismuth compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate and colloidal bismuth citrate. The bismuth compounds are beheved to enhance secretion of mucous and HCO3", inhibit pepsin activitv, 2nd act as an antibacterial against H. pylori. Ingestion of bismuth compounds, however, can lead to elevated plasma concentrations of Bi"^^ and can interfere with the ^sorption of other drugs.<br>
Prostaglandin analogues, such as misoprostal, inhibit secretion of acid and stimulate the secretion of mucous and bicarbonate and are also used to treat ulcers, especially ulcers in patients who require nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Effective oral doses of prostz^landin analogues, however, can cause diarrhea and abdominal cramping. In addition, some prostaglandin analogues are abortifacients.<br>
Carbenoxolone, a mineral corticoid, can also be used to treat ulcers. Carbenoxolone appears to alter the composition and quantity of mucous, thereby enhancing the mucosal barrier. Carbenoxolone, however, can lead to Na* and fluid retention, hypertension, hypokalemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.<br>
Muscarinic cholinergic antagonists such as pirenzapine and telenzapine can also be used to reduce acid secretion and treat ulcers. Side effects of muscarinic cholinergic<br><br>
antagonists include dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation. Tlie Merck Manual of Medical Information 496-500 (R. Berkow ed., 1997) and Goodman and Oilman's Tlie Pharmacological Basis ofTJierapeulics 901-915 (J. Hardman and L. Limbird eds., 9* ed. 1996V<br>
IBD is a chronic disorder in which the bowel becomes inflamed, often causina recurring abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The two types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.<br>
Crohn's disease, which can include regional enteritis, granulomatous ileitis, and ileocolids, is a chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall. Crohn's disease occurs equally in both sexes and is more common in Jews of eastern-European ancestry. Most cases of Crohn's disease begin before age 30 and the majority start between the ages of 14 and 24. The disease typically affects the fill! thickness of the intestinal wall. Generally the disease affects the lowest portion of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine, but can occur in any part of the digestive tract.<br>
Early symptoms of Crohn's disease are chronic diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Complications associated with Crohn's disease include the development of intestinal obstnictions, abnormal connecting channels (fistulas), and abscesses. The risk of cancer of the large intestine is increased in people wb-^ have Crohn's disease. Often Crohn's disease is associated with other disorders such as gallstones, inadequate absorption of nutrients, amyloidosis, arthritis, episcleritis, aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroilitis, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. There is no known cure for Crohn's disease.<br>
Cramps and diarrhea, side effects associated with Crohn's disease, can be relieved by anticholinergic drugs, diphenoxylate, loperamide, deodorized opium tincture, or codeine. Generally, the drug is taken orally before a meal.<br>
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often administered to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease. The antibiotic metronidazole is often administered when the disease affects the large intestine or causes abscesses and fistulas around the anus. Long-term use of metronidazole, however, can damage nerves, resulting in pins-and-needles sensations in the arms and legs. Sulfasalazine and chemically related drugs can suppress mild inflammation, especially in the large intestine. These drugs, however, are less effective in sudden, severe<br><br>
flare-ups. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, reduce fever and diarrhea and relieve abdominal pain and tenderness. Long-term corticosteroid therapy, however, invariably results in serious side effects such as iii^ blood-sugar levels, increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, water retention, and fragility of the skin. Drugs such as azathioprine and mercaptourine can compromise the immune system and are often effective for Crohn's disease in patients that do not respond to other drugs. These drugs, however, usually need 3 to 6 months before they produce benefits and can cause serious side effects such as allergy, pancreatitis, and low white-blood-cell count.<br>
When Crohn's disease causes the intestine to be obstructed or when abscesses or tlstulas do not heal, surgery can be necessary to remove diseased sections of the intestine. Surgery, however, does not cure the disease, and inflammation tends to recur where the intestine is rejoined. In almost half of the cases a second operation is needed. Hie Merck Manual of Medical Information 52S-530 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease in which the large intestine becomes inflamed and ulcerated, leading to episodes of bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Ulcerative colitis usually begins between ages 15 and 30; however, a small group of people have their first attack between ages 50 and 70. Unlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis never affects the small intestine and does not affect the full thickness of the intestine  The disease nsuaUy begins in the rectum and the sigmoid colon and eventually spreads partially or completely through out the large intestine. The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown.<br>
Treatment of ulcerative colitis is directed to controlling inflammation, reducing symptoms, and replacing lost fluids and nutrients. Anticholinergic drugs and low doses of diphenoxylate or loperamide are administered for treating mild diarrhea. For more intense diarrhea higher doses of diphenoxylate or loperamide, or deodorized opium tincture DF codeine are administered- Sulfasalazine, olsalazie, prednisone, or mesalamine can be used to reduce inflammation. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine have been BSKI to maintain remissions in ulcerative-colitis patients who would otherwise need long-term corticosteroid Teatment. In severe cases of ulcerative colitis the patient is hospitalized and given ;orticosteroids intravenously. People with severe rectal bleeding can require transfusions and ntravenous fluids. If toxic colitis develops and treatments fail, surgery to remove the large ntestine can be necessary. Non-emergency surgery can be perforaied if cancer is diagnosed.<br><br>
precancerous legions are detected, or unremitting chronic disease would otherwise make the person an invalid or dependent on high doses of corticosteroids. Complete removal of the large intestine and rectum permanently cures ulcerative coliris.  Tlie Merck Manual of Medical Information 530-532 (R. Berkow ed., 1997) and Goodman and Gilman 's TJic Pharmacological Basis ofllterapetitics (J. Hardman and L. Limbird eds., 9"' ed. 1996).<br>
IBS is a disorder of motihty of the entire gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, constipation, and/or diarrhea. IBS affects three-times more women than men. In IBS stimuli such as stress, diet, drugs, hormones, or irritants can cause the gastrointestinal tract to contract abnormally. During an episode of IBS contractions of the gastrointestinal tract become stronger and more frequent, resulting in the rapid transit of food and feces through the small intestine, often leading to diarrhea. Cramps result from the strong contractions of the large intestine and increased sensitivity of pain receptors in the large intestine.<br>
There are two major types of IBS. The first type, spastic-colon type, is commonly triggered by eating, and usually produces periodic constipation and diarrhea with pain. Mucous often appears in the stool. Thepain can come in bouts of continuous dull aching pain or cramps, usually in the lower abdomen. The person suffering from spastic-colon type IBS can also experience bloating, gas, nausea, headache, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. The second type of IBS usually produces painless diarrhea or constipation. The diarriiea can begin suddenly and with extteme urgency. Often the diairiiea occurs soon after a meal and can sometimes occur immediately upon awakening.<br>
Treatment of IBS typically involves modification of an IBS-patient's diet-Often it is recommended that an IBS patient avoid beans, cabbage, sorbitol, and fiiictose. A low-fat, high-fiber diet can also help some IBS patients. Regular physical ^tivity can also help keep the gastrotntestiQal tract functioning properly. Drugs such as propantheline that slow the function of the gastromtestinal tract are generally not effective for treating IBS. Antidiarrheal drugs, such as diphenoxylate and loperamide, help with diarrhea: Tire Merck Manual of Medical Information 525-526 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Many drugs can cause physical and/or psychological addiction. Those most well known types of these drugs include opiates, such as heroin, opium, and morphine; sympathomimetics, including cocaine and amphetamines; sedative-hypnotics, including<br><br>
alcohol, benzodiazepines and barbiturates; and nicotine, which has effects similar to opioids and sympathomimetics. Drug addiction is characterized by a craving or compulsion for taking the drug and an inability to limit its intake. Additionally, drug dependence is associated with drug tolerance, the loss of effect of the drug following repeated i administration, and withdrawal, the appearance of physical and behavioral symptoms when the drug is not consumed. Sensitization occurs if repeated administration of a drug leads to an increased response to each dose. Tolerance, sensitization, and withdrawal are phenomena evidencing a change in the central ner\'ous system resulting from continued use of the drug. This change can motivate the addicted individual to continue consuming the drug despite serious social, legal, physical and/or professional consequences. {See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,109,269 to Rise era/.).<br>
Certain pharmaceutical agents have been administered for treating addiction. U.S. Patent No. 5,556,838 to Mayer et al. discloses the use of nontoxic NMDA-bloctdng agents co-administered with an addictive substance to prevent the development of tolerance or withdrawal symptoms. U.S. Patent No. 5,574,052 to Rose et al. discloses co¬administration of an addictive substance with an antagonist to partially block the pharmacological effects of the substance. U.S.Patent No. 5,075,341 to Mendeison ei a^. discloses the use of a mixed opiate agonist/antagonist to treat cocaine and opiate addiction. U.S. Patent No. 5,232,934 to Downs discloses administration of 3-phenoxypyridine to treat addiction. U.S. Patents No. 5,039,680 and 5,198,459 to hnperato et al. disclose using a serotonin antagonist to treat chemical addiction. U.S. Patent No. 5,556,837 to Nastier et. al. discloses infiising BDNF or NT-4 grovrth factors to inhibit or reverse neurological adaptive changes that correlate with behavioral changes in an addicted individual. U.S. Patoit No. 5,762,925 to Sagan discloses implanting encapsulated adrenal medullary cells into an animal's central nervous system to inhibit the development of opioid intolerance. U.S. Patent No. 6,204,284 to Beer et al. discloses racemic (±)-l-(3,4-dichlDrophenyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.i.0]hexane for use in the prevention or rehef of a withdrawal syndrome resulting from addiction to drugs and for the treatment of chemical dependencies.<br>
Parkinson's disease is a clinical syndrome comprising bradykinesia (slowness and poverty of movement), muscular rigidity, resting tremor (which usually abates during voluntary movement), and an impairment of postural balance leading to disturbance of gait<br><br>
and falling. The features of Parkinson's disease are a loss of pigmented, dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the appearance of intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies (Goodman and Gillman 's Tlie Pharmaceutical Basis of Tlierapeutics 506 (9* ed. 1996)). Without treatment, Parkinson's disease progresses to a rigid akinetic state in which patients are incapable of caring for themselves. Death frequently restUts from compiicalions of immobility, including aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Drugs commonly used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease include carbidopa/levodopa, pergolide, bromocriptine, selegiline, amantadine, and trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride. There remains, however, a need for drugs useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and having an improved therapeutic profile.<br>
Anxiety is a fear, apprehension, or dread of impending danger often accompanied by restlessness, tension, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Other symptoms commonly associated with anxiety include depression, especially accompanied with dysthymic disorder (chronic "neurotic" depression); panic disorder; agoraphobia and other specific phobias; eating disorders; and many personality disorders. Often anxiety is unattached to a clearly identified treatable primary illness. If a primary ilbiess is found, however, it can be desirable to deal with the anxiety at the same time as the primary illness.<br>
Currently, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used anti-anxiety agents for generalized anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines, however, carry the risk of producing impairment of cognition and skilled motor functions, particularly in the eldorly, which can result in confusion, deleriima, and falls with fractures. Sedatives are also commonly prescribed for treating anxiety. The azapirones, such as buspirone, are also used to treat moderate anxiety. The azapirones, however, are less usefiil for treating severe anxiety accompanied with panic attacks.<br>
Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by the tendency to have recurring seizures. The etiology commonly consists of lesions in some part of the cortex, such as a timior; ievelopmental malformation; or damage due to trauma or stroke. In some cases the etiology :s genetic. An epileptic seizure can be triggered by repetitive sounds, flashing lights, video games, or touching certain parts of the body. Epilepsy is typically treated with anti-seizure Irugs. In epilepsy cases, where anti-seizure drugs are ineffective, and the defect in the brain .s isolated to a small area of the brain, surgical removal of that part of the brain can be helpful<br><br>
in alleviating the seizures. In patients who have several sources for the seizures or who have seizures that spread quickly to all parts of the brain, surgical removal of the nerve fibers diat connect the two sides of the brain can be heipfiii.<br>
Examples of drugs for treating a seizure and epilepsy include carbamazepine, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lamotrignine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid, trimethadione, bemzodiaepines, 7-vinyl GABA. acetazoiamide, and felbamate. Anti-seizure drugs, however, can have side effects such as drowsiness; hyperactivity; hallucinations; inability to concentrate; central and peripheral nervous system toxicity, such as nystagmus, ataxia, diplopia, and vertigo; gingival hyperplasia; gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and anorexia; endocrine effects such as inhibidon of antidiuretic hormone, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, osteomalacia; and hypersensitivity such as scarlatinifonn rash, morbilliform rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic necrosis; and hematological reactions such as red-cell aplasia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and megaloblastic anemia. The Merck. Manual of Medical Information 345-350 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
A seizure is the result of abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. The discharge can involve a small area of the brain and lead to the person only noticing an odd taste or smell or it can involve a large area of the brain and lead to convulsions, i.e., a seizure ;hat causes jerking and spasms of the muscles throughout the body. Convulsions can also result in brief attacks of altered consciousness and loss of consciousness, muscle control, or jladder control. A seizures is often preceded by auras, i.e., unusual sensations of smell, taste, ■K vision or an intense feeling that a seizure is about to begin. A seizure typically lasts for ibout 2 to 5 minutes. When the seizure ends the person can have headache, sore muscles, musual sensations, confusion, and profound fatigue (postictal state).

A stroke or cerebrovascular accident, is the death of brain tissue (cerebral nfarction) resniting from the lack of blood flow and insufficient oxygen to the brain. A Iroke can be either ischemic or hemorrhagic. In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to the jrain is cut off because of atherscierosis or a blood clot that has blocked a biood vessel. In a lemoirhagic stroke, a blood vessel bursts preventing nomial blood flow and allowing blood o leak into an area of the brain and destroying it. Most strokes develop rapidly and cause<br><br>
brain damage within minutes. In some cases, however, strokes can continue to worsen for several hours or days. Symptoms of strokes vary depending on what part of the brain is effected. Symptoms include loss or abnormal sensations in an arm or leg or one side of the body, weakness or paralysis of an arm or leg or one side of the body, partial loss of vison or hearing, double vision, dizziness, slurred speech, difficulty in thinking of the appropriate word or saying it, inability to recognize parts of the body, unusual movements, loss of bladder control, imbalance, and falUng, and fainting. The symptoms can be permanem and can be associated with coma or stupor. Strokes can cause edema or swelling of the brain which can further damage brain tissue. For persons suffering fiom a stroke, intensive rehabilitation can help overcome the disability caused by impairment of brain tissue. Rehabilitation trains other parts of the brain to assume the tasks previously performed by the damaged part.<br>
Examples of dmgs for treating strokes include anticoagulants such as heparin, drugs that break up clots such as streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator, and drugs that reduce swelling such as mannitol or corticosteroids.

Pruritus is an unpleasant sensation that prompts scratching. Pruritus can be attributed to dry skin, scabies, dermatitis, herpetiformis, atopic denaaiitis, piitritus vulvae et ani, miliaria, insect bites, pediculosis, contact dermatitis, drug reactions, urticaria, urticarial ertiptions of pregnancy, psoriasis, hchen planus, Uchen simplex chronicus, exfoliative dermatitis, folliculitis, bullous pemphigoid, and fiberglass dermatitis. Conventionally, prurihjs is treated by phototherapy with ultraviolet B or PUVA or with th^apeutic agents such as naltrexone, nalmefene, danazol, tricychcs, and antidepressants.<br>
Selective antagonists of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ("mGluRS") have been shown to exert analgesic activity in in vivo animal models (K. Walker et ai. Neuropharmacology 40:1 -9 (2000) and A. Dogrul et al., Neiiroscience Letters, 292(2): 115-118(2000)).<br>
Selective antagonists of the mGluR5 receptor have also been shown to exert anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity in in vivo animal models (E. Tatarczynska et al, Br. J. Pharmacol I32(7):1423-1430 (2001) and P.J.M. Will etal, Trends in Pharmacological 5c(e;jce5 22(7);331-37 (2001)).<br><br>
Selective antagonists of the mGluR5 receptor have also been shown to exert ann-Parkinson activity in vivo (K. J. Ossowska et a!., Neurophaimacology 41_(4):413-20 (2001) and PJ.M. Will et ai. Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 22(7):331-37 (2001)}.<br>
Selective antagonists of the mGliiRi receptor have also been shown to exert anti-dependence activity in vivo (C. Chiamulera et ai. Nature Neiiroscience 4{9):S73-74 (2001)).<br>

In yet ziiother embodiment, a controlled- or .sustained-release sj^em can be placed in proximity of 2 target of flieCj'anoimiDopiperazine Compounds, e.^., tbe spinal column, brain. 31 gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the sj^temic dose.<br>
The present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a iharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to heaciimii.<br>
Such phamiaceiitical excipient'? nan be liquids, such as water and oils, Dciading those of petroleum, aoimal, vegetable, oi- synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, ojteart oil mineral oil, sesame oil and the like.. The phamiaceutical excipienls can be atjne, giiTR acacia^ gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea and the like. In ddition, aimliaiy-, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In mc emhcdinieni, the phaxmaceutically acceptable excipicnts are sterile ■v&gt;.-hen administered to n animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when the Cyanoiminopiperazine<br><br>
Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol soiutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pliarmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, mall, rice, flour, chaik, silica gel, sodium stearaie, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The }&gt;resent compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.<br>
The preseni compositions can take the fomi of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, suf-tained-release fonnulat?ons, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see e.g.. U.S. Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable piiamiaceutical excipients ais descnhed in Remington's Phannaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., l?thed. 1995). incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds are tbnnuiaced in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral admiuistration to h'-im3ii. beings. Composidons tor oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspension"?, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, fot example. Orally administered compositions can contain one or more asents^ for example, s'/veeiening agents such as ftuctose, aspartame or sacchaiin; ilavoring agents such as pcppennint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a phannaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract tliereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable mambianes surroimding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions, bi these latter plattbrms, fluid from the environment surroimding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. Tliese delivery platfomis can provide an essentially zero order deliveiY profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol steaiate can also be used. Oral ccmpositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium<br><br>
stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
In another embodiment, the C&gt;"anoittiinopipera2ine Compounds can be formulated for intravenous administration. T&gt;pically, compositions for intravenous adininistration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry iyophiljzed powder or water free concentrate in a hermeticaliy sealed contaioer such as. an ampule ov sachette indicating the quantit&gt;' of active agent. Where the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile phannaceutical grade water or saline. Where the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds are administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injei.;tior or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.<br>
The Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds can be administereti by controlled-release: oi sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are well Icnown to those of ordinary skill in the -an. Examples include, bm are not limited to, those described in U.S.  : Patent Nos.; 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4.008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5354,556: and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coalings, microparticles, iiposoraes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release Ibrmulations known to those of ordinaiy skill in the art, including those describe-d herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus SQcorapa-^ses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.<br>
Controlled- or suslained-releass pharmaceutical compositions can have a ■:ommon goal of improving dmg ther?.\&gt;y over ';hat achieved by '■heii non -controlled or non-<br><br>
sustained counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Ad\-antages of controlled- or susiained-relsase compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the lime of onset of action or other chaiacleristics, such as blood levels of the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side sffectE.<br>
Conti'olled' or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount &gt;f a Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound thai promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the !?yanoinimopiperazine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effecl )ver an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Cyanoiminopiperazine 3r-rapound in the boiiy, the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound can be released from the iosage form ai a rate tliat will replace the amoimt of Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound bein: netabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustairied-release or an active n.gredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in iH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or vailabiiity of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>

Test Animals: Each experiment uses rats weighing between 200-260 g at the start of thy experiment. The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all ^mes, except prior to oral administration of a Cyanoiminopiperazine Conipoiicd when food is removed ibr 16 hoiirs before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a CyanoiminopipCTazine Compouiid. The control group is administis-ed the earner for he Cyanoiminqpiperazine Corapoimd. The volume of carrier administered to the control ^up is the same as ttie volume of carrier and Cyanoiminopiperdzine Compound uindnistered to'the test gyoap.<br>
Acute Pain: To assess the actions of the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds for the reatment or prevention of acute pain the rat tail flick test can be used. Kats are gently estrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of r^iant heat at a point 5 cm from he tip using a tail flick unit ^lodel 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tsij flick latencies are defined as the inters'al between the onset of the thermal stimulus and he flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from tiie tail lick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies ai-e measured<br><br>
immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1,3, and 5 hours following admiaistration of a Cyaiioiminopiperazine Compound. Data are expressed as tail flick ]atency{s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), i.e., 20 seconds, is calculated as follow<br>

The results shew that the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds are useful for trsaiing or preventing inflammatory pain.<br>
Nem-ppathic Pain: To assess the actions of the Cyanoiminopiperazine Compounds for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain either the Seltrxr model or the Chung mode! cat- be vsed.<br>
In the Seltzer model., the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is .. used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et a!., "A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve bjury," Pain 43:205-2 IS (1990)). Paitial ligation of the left sciatic uer/s is performed under isoflurane/0, inhalation anaesiiiesia. Following induction of anesthesia, tlie left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciaiic nerve e'cposed at high thigh level tb ough a small incision and is carefaliy clejired of siuTOunding connective tissues at a site near ihc trocaiitherjust distal to tlae point at which ihe posterior biceps S'^imitendinosus nerve hraucbss off of the common sciatic nerv:e.

The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and a Vetbond surgical . glue. Following surgery, the wotmd area is dusted v/ith antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgjcal procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover &amp;om anesthesia. Afiimals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal la assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hoiu-s sJler drugadministiationfortheleft rearpawof ihe animal.

fn the Chung model, the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in rats. Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O, inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspina! muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L, - S, levels. The Lg transverse process is caiefuUy removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L^ - Lj spinal nerves. The left L5 (or L5 and Lj) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly hgated with silk thread. A complete hemostasia is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel stales. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure excqjt thai the spina nc'.ve(s) is aot manipulated. Following surgery viniraals are weighed, adrainistered a-   • subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wouiid area is dusted with ac'iihiotic powder ajid they are kept on a warm pad until they recova' from the anesthesia. Animals sia then rehimed to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are aiisessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuU by determining PWT, as described below,priortosurgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1,3, and 5 hours alter being admimstered a Cyanoiminopiperazine Compound for the lefl rear paw of the animal. The animal car* also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, tu described below. The Chung model forneuropalbic pain is described jnS-H. Kim, "An Hxperimcntal Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat," Pain 50(3):355-363 (1992). The results will show that Cyauoiminopiperazine Compounds are usefiii tor treating or preventing neuropathic pain.<br>
Response to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia: The paw pressurs assay can ha used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw v.'ithdmvval thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus are determined using an analg5.i;&gt;'niet€T (Model 72t», commeroiaily available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described ir. C. Stein, "Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Siimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds." Pharmacology<br><br>
Biochemistry and Behavior 31:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that can be applied to the hind paw is set at 250 g and the end point is taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT is determined once for each rat at each time point and only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested.<br>
Response to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thennal Hyperalgesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this lest, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially a^'ailable fi-om Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et al., "A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring lliennal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia.'/^gjn 32(n:77-88 (19S8)- The maximum exposuretimeisselat 32 second? to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrav/al from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three Latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested.<br>
Assessment of Tactile AJlodvnia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in cieai-, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habiuiate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a;?eries ofvonFreynM'no^anicnis are presented to the jlantai' surl'ace of the left (operated) foot of each rat The series of von Frey monoalaments lonsists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber )resented first Five trials are conducted with each Sl-'unent with each trial separateii by ipprqximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a lociceprive withdrarral behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or h'cking of the law are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.<br>
5.8. Example ii: In Wvo Assays for Preveption or Treatment of Anaety<br>
The elevated plus maze test or the shock-probe burying t^t can be used to ssess the anxiolytic activity of Cyanoiminopipereazine Compounds in rats or mice.<br>
The Elevated Plus Maze Test: The elevated plus maze consists of a platform /irh 4 arms, t'A^o open and two closed (50x10x50 cm enclosed with an open roof). Rats (or lice) are placed in the center of the platform, at the crossroad of the 4 arms, facing one of the losed arms. Time spent in Hie open 3ims vs the closed .'ums and number of open zxm enhies<br><br>
during the testing period are recorded. This test is conducted prior to drug administration and again after drug administration. Test results are expressed as the mean time spent in open arms, and the mean number of entries into open arms. Known anxioiytic drugs increase both the time spent in open arms and number of open arm eniries. The elevated plus maze test is described in D. Tr«t "Aijimai Models for the Study of Anti-anxiety Agents: A Review," NmroscisTice &amp; BiobeliavioralRe\'iews %2):2G3-222 {\9H5).<br>
The Shock-Probe Burving Test: For the shock-probe burying test the testing app:iratus consists ofapiexigiass box measuring 40x50x40 cm, evenly covered with approximately 5 cm of bedding material (odcr absorbent kitty litter) with a small hole in one end tb'ough which a shock probe (6.5 cm long ar.d 0.5 cm in diameter) is inserted. ITie plexiglass shock probe is helically wrapped with two copper wires through which an electric^ cuTsnt is administered. The current is set at 2 mA. Rats are habituated to the testing apparatus for 30 min on 4 consecutive days without the shock probe in the box. On test day, rats are placed in one comer of the test chamber followin&amp;. drug administra! ion. The probe is not electrified imtiJ the rat touches it with its snout cr fore paws, at which point Lhe rat Tijceives » ':.^rief 2 m.A shock. Tht 15 min tesiing period begins once the rat receives itr. fiist i:hock and 'Jbe probe remains electrified for the Tem£Jn'ing behavior) is measured as well as the nunibei' of contact-induced shocks the rat receives from ttie probe. Known anxiolytic drugs reduce die amount of burying behavior. In addition, an index of the rat's reactivity to each shock is scored on a 4 point scale. The total time spent immobile during the 15 min testing period is used as an index of general activity. The shock-probe burying test is described in D. Treit, 1985, supra. The results of this test will demoustrate that Cyanoiminopipeieazine Compounds are n^efiil for treating or V'?t\eiititg soxieiy.<br>
5.9. Example 9: In I'ivo Assays for Prevention or Treatment of an Addictive Disorder<br>
The conditioned place preference test or dnig self-administration test cax\ be used to assess tlie. ability of Cyanoiminopipereazine Compounds to attenuate tl:e rewarding propeTtieE of kiiowu drugs of abuse.<br><br>
The Conditioned Place Preference Test: The apparatus for the conditioned place preference test consists of two large compartments (45x45x30 cm) made of wood with a plexiglass ^ont wall. These two large compartments are distinctly different. Doors at the back of each large compartment lead to a smaller box (36x18x20 cm) box made of wood, painted grey, with a ceiling of wire mesh. The two large compartments differ in terms of shading (white vs black), level of illumination (the plexiglass door of the white compartment is covered with aimninum foil except for a window of 7x7 cm), texture (the white compartment has a 3 cm thick floor board (40x40 cm) with, nine equally spaced 5 cm diameter holes and the black has a wire mesh floor), and olfactory cues (saline in the white compaitRTen'. and I ml of 10% acetic acid in the black comparunerit). On habituation and testing days, the doors to the small box remain open, giving the rat free access to both large compartri'.ents.<br>
The first session that a rat is placed in the apparatus is a habituation session and entrances to the smaller giey compartment remain o^ieri gi-Jina the rai free ^Ciss to both laige coinpartmcnts. During habituation, mts generally sJaow no preference for either companmear. FoUcwing habivuation, rats are given 6 conditioTiing sessions. Rats are divided . into 4 groups; car:i'^r pre-treatment + carrier (control group), Cyanoiminopipereazine C:ompouiV.i pre-treatment -^ carrier, carrier pre-treatment + morphine, Cyanoimmopipereazine Compound pre-treatment + morphine. During each conditioning session the rat is injected with one of the drug combinations and confined to one compartment for 30 min. On the following day, tiiexat receives a carrier + earner treatment and is amfiiied to fee oflier-large -■ompartmsnt. Each rat receives three conditioning sessions consisting of 3 drug ;ombinarionrcompaitment.and 3 carrier-compartment pairings. The older of injections and he drug/corapaitment pairings are counterbalanced within groups. On the test day, rats ai-e jijected prior to testing (30 min to 1 hour) with either morphine or carrier and fee rat is Placed in the ^^aratus, fee doors to the grey compartment remain open and the rat is allowed :o explore fee entire apparatus for 20 min. The time spent in each compartment is recorded. •Cnown drugs of abuse increase the time spent in fee drug-paiied compartment during fee estina sessioi:. If fee Cyanoiminopipereazine Compound blocks the act{uisition of morphine :onditioned place preference (reward), there will be no difference in time spent in each side .n rats pre-treated wife a Cyatioiriiinopipereazine Compound and the group will not be<br><br>
different from the group of rats that was given carrier + carrier in both compartments. Data will be analyzed as time spent in each compartment (drug combination-paired vs carrier-paired). Generally, the experiment is repeated with a minimum of 3 doses of a Cyanoiminopipereazine Compound.<br>
The Dmg Self-Administrarion Test: The apparatus for the drug self-administration test is a standard commercially available operant conditioning chamber. Before drug trials begin rats are trained to press 9 lever for a food reward. After stable lever pressing behavior is acquired, rats are tested for acquisition of lever pressing for drug reward. Rats are implanted w/ith chronically indwelling jugular catheters for i.v. administration of compounds and are allowed 10 recover for 7 days before training begins. Experimental sessions are conducted daily for 5 days in 3 hour sessions. Rats are trained to self-administer a known drug of abuse, such as moiphine. Rats are then presented with two levers, an "active" lever and an "inactive" lever. Pressing of the active lever results in drug infiision on a fixed ratio 1 (FRl) schedule (Le., oat lever press gives an infusion) followed by a 20 second time out period (signaled by iUuminatiou of a light above the levers). Pressing of the inactive lever results m infusion of excipient. Training continues until the total number of morphine infusions stabilizes to within ± 10% per session. Trained rats are then used to evaluate the effect of Cyanoimiiopipereazine Compounds pre-treatment on drag self-administration. On test day, nits are pte-treated with a Cj'anoiminopipereazine Compoimd or excipient and then are allowed to self-administer drug as usual. If the Cyanoiminopipereazine Compound blocks the rewarding effects of morphine, rats pre-trealed with the Cyanoiminopipereazine Compound will show a lower rate, of responding compared to their previous rate of responding and compared to excipient pre-treated rats. Data is malyzed as the change in number of drug infusions per testing session (immber of infusions luiing test session - number of infusions during training session). The results will iemonshate that Cyanoiminopipereazme Compounds are usefiil for treating or preventing an iddictive disorder.<br>
