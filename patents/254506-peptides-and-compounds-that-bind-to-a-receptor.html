PEFTIDES AND COMPOUNDS THAT BIND TO A RECEPTOR<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
	This application claims priority to U.S. Application Serial No. 60/498,740 filed on<br>
August 28. 2003.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention provides peptide compounds that bind to and activate the<br>
thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpt or TPO-R) or otherwise act as a TPO agonist. The<br>
invention has application in the fields of biochemistry and medicinal chemistry and<br>
particularly provides TPO agonists for use in the treatment of human disease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Megakaryocytes are bone marrow-derived cells, which arc responsible for<br>
producing circulating blood platelets. Although comprising 
cells in most species, they have &gt; 10 times the volume of typical marrow cells. Sec Kuter.<br>
et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11104-11108 (1994). Megakaryocyies undergo a<br>
process known as endomitosis whereby they replicate their nuclei but fail to undergo cell<br>
division and thereby give rise to polyploid cells. In response to a decreased platelet count,<br>
the cndomitotic rate increases, higher ploidy megakaryacytes are farmed, and the number<br>
of megakaryocytes may incresse up to 3-fold. See Harker, J. Clin. Invest,. 47:458-465<br>
(1968). in contrast, in response to an elevated platelet count. the cndomitotic rate<br>
decreases, lower ploidy megakaryocytes are formed, and the number of megakaryocytes<br>
may decrease by 50%.<br>
	The exact physiological feedback mechanism by which the mass of circulating<br>
plutelets regulates the endomitotic rate and number of bone marrow megakaryocytes is not<br>
known. The circulating thrombopoietic factor involved in mediating this feedback loop is<br>
now thought to be thrombopoicim (TPO). More specifically, TPO has been shown to be<br>
the mai`n humoral regulator in situations involving thrombocytopenia. See, e.g.. Metcalf,<br><br>
Nature. 369:51 9-520) (1994). TPO has been shown in several studies to increase platelet<br>
counts, incrcase platelet size, and increase isotope incorporation into platelets of recipient<br>
animal. Specifically. TPO is thought to affect megakaryocytopoiesis in several ways: (1)<br>
it produces increases in megakaryocyte size and number; (2) it produces an increase in<br>
DNA content, in the form of polyploidy, in rnegakaryocytes; (3) it increases<br>
megakaryoeyte endomitosis: (4) it produces increased maturation of megakaryocytes; and<br>
(5) it produces an increase in the percentage of precursor cells, in the form of small<br>
acetylcholinesterase-positive cells, in the bone marrow.<br>
	Platets (thrombocytes) are necessary for blood clotting. When their numbers are<br>
very low 3 patient is al serious risk of death from catastrophic hemorrhage, TPO therefore<br>
has potential useful application in both the diagnosis and the treatment of various<br>
hematological disorders, for example diseases primarily due to platelet delects. Ongoing<br>
clinical trials with TPO have indicated that TPO can be administered safely to patients. In<br>
addition, recent studies have provided a basis for the projection of efficacy of TPO therapy<br>
in the treatment of chrombocytopenia, and particularly thrombocytopenia resulting from<br>
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transplantation as treatment for cancer or<br>
lymphoma. Sec, e.g. McDonald, Am. J. Ped, Hematology/Oncology, 14:8-21(1992).<br>
	The gene encoding TPO has been cloned and characterized. See Kuter. et al.. Proe.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:11104-11108 (1994): Barley, et al. Cell 77:1117-1124 (1994);<br>
Kaushansky et al. Nature 369:568-571 (1994); Wendling. et al.. Nature. 369:571-574<br>
(1994); and Sarvagc et al.. Nature 369:533-538 (1994). Thrombopoietin is a glycoprotein<br>
with al least two forms, with apparent molecular masses of 25 kDa and 31 kDa, with a<br>
common N-terminat amino acid sequence. See, Bartley. et al.. Cell, 77:1117-1124 (1994).<br>
Thrombopoietin appears to have two distinct regions separated by a potential Arg-Arg<br>
cleavage site. The armno-terminal region is highly conserved in man and mouse and has<br>
some homology with erythropoietin and interferon-a and interfcron-b. The carboxy-<br>
terminal region shows wide species divergence.<br>
	The DNA sequences and encoded peptide sequences for human TPO-R (also<br>
known as c-mpl) have been described. See Vigon. et al.. Proc, Natl. A cad. Sci. USA,<br>
89:5640-5644 (1992). TPO-R is a member of the hematopoietin growth factor receptor<br>
2<br><br>
family, a family characterized by a common structural design of the extracellular domain,<br>
including four conserved C residues in the N-tenninal portion and a WSXWS motif (SEQ<br>
ID NO:1) close to the transmembrane region. See Bazan. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.<br>
87:6934-6938 1990). Evidence that this receptor plays a functional role in hemaiopoiesis<br>
inctudes observations that its expression is restricted to spleen, bone marrow, or fetal liver<br>
in mice (see Souyri. et al, Cell 63:1137-1147 (1990)) and to megakaryocytes, platelets.<br>
and CD34+ cells in humans (sec Methia, et al Blood 82:1395-1401 (1993)). Furthermore,<br>
exposure of CD34 + cells to synthetic oligcinucleotides antisense to mpl RNA significantly<br>
inhibits the appearance of megakaryocyle colonies without affecting erythroid or myeloid<br>
colony formation. Some workers postulate that the receptor functions as a homodimer,<br>
similar to the situation with the receptors for G-CSF and erythropoietin.<br>
	The availability of cloned genes for TPO-R facilitates the search for agonists of this<br>
important recepior. The availability of the recomhinant receptor protein allows the study of<br>
raccptor-litian. intcraction in a Variety of random and semi-random peptidc diversity<br>
generation systems. These systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6.251,864, 6,083,913,<br>
6121238. 5.9.12.546. 5.869.451. 6.506.362. and 6.465.430. and in Cwirla et a!., Proc.<br>
Narl. Acad. SC. USA 87;6378-6382 (1990). each of the foregoing is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
	The slow recovery of platelet levels in patients suffering from thrombocytopenia is<br>
a serious problem, and has lent urgency to the search for a blood growth factor agonist able<br>
to accelerate platelet regeneration. The present invention provides such an agonist.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention is directed to defined low molecular weight peptide<br>
compounds that have strong binding properties to the TPO-.R, can activate the TPO-R. and<br>
potentially permit reduced side effects compared to known TPO agonists- Accordingly.<br>
the peptide compounds can be useful for therapeutic purposes in treating, conditions<br>
mediated by TPO [e.g., thrombocytopenia resulting from chemotherapy, radiation therapy,<br>
or bone marrow transfusions) as well as for diagnostic purposes in studying the mechanism<br>
3<br><br>
of hematopoiesis and for the in vitro expansion of megakaroycytes and committed,<br>
progenitor cells.<br>
	Peptide compounds suitable for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes have an IC50<br>
of about 2 mM or less, as determined by, for example, the binding affinity assay set forth<br>
in Example 301 U.S. Patent No, 5,869.451. wherein a lower IC50 correlates to a stronger<br>
binding aflinity to TPO-R. The assay in U.S. Patent No. 5,869,451 is as follows: Binding<br>
affinities of peptide compounds are measured in a competition binding assay. The wells of<br>
a microtite plate are coated with 1 mg streptavidin, blocked with PBS/1 % BSA, followed<br>
by 50 ng of biotinylated anti-receptor immobilizing antibody (Abl79), The wells are then<br>
treated with a 1:10 dilution of soluble TPO-R harvest.. Various concentrations of peptide<br>
compound are mixed with a constant amount ot a truncated form of TPO consisting of<br>
residues 1-156 fused to the C-terminus of maltose binding protein (MBP-TPO156). The<br>
peplide MBP-TPO156 mixtures are added to the TPO-R coated wells, incubated for 2 hours<br>
at 4ºC and then washed with PBS. The amount of MBP-TPO156 that is bound an<br>
equilibrium is measured by adding a rabbit, anti-sera directed against MBP. followed by<br>
alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit lgG. The amount of alkaline phosphatasc<br>
in each well is then determined using. standacd methods, The, assay is conducted over a<br>
range of peptido compound concentrations and the results are graphed such that the y axis<br>
represents the amount of bound MBP-TPO156 and the x axis represents the concentration of<br>
peptide compound. One can then determine the concentration at which the peptide<br>
compound will reduce by 50% (IC50) the amount of MBP-TPO156 bound to immobilized<br>
TPO-R, The dissociation constant (Kd) for the peptide should be similar to the measured<br>
IC50 using these assay conditions. For pharmaceutical purposes, the peptide compounds<br>
preferably have an IC50 of no more than about 100 M, more preferably no more than 500<br>
nM. In a preferred embodiment, the molecular weight of the peptide compound is from<br>

	Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide<br>

(1987). which are incorporated herein by reference). Peptide mimetics that are structurally<br>
similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent or<br>
enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimeties are structurally<br>
similar to a paridigm polypeptidc (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or<br>
pharmacylogical activity), such as naturally-occurring receptor-binding polypeptide. but<br>

CH2NH—, Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over poiypeptide<br>
embodiments, including, for example: more economical production, greater chemical<br>
stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy,<br>
etc.), altered specificity (e.g... a broad-specirum of biological activities), reduced<br>
satigenicity, and others. Labeling of peptidomimetics usually involves eovalent attachment<br>
of one or more labels, directly or through a spacer (e.g., an amide group), to non-<br>
interfering position(s) on the peptidomimetic that arc predicted by quantitative structure<br>
activity data and/or molecular modeling. Such non-interfering positions generally are<br>
positions that do not form direct contacts with the macromolecules(s) (e.g..<br>
immunoglobulin superfamily molecules) to which the peptidomimetic; binds to produce the<br>
therapeutic effect. Derivitization (e,g,. labeling) of peptidomimetics should not<br>
substantially interfere with the desired biological or pharmacological activity of the<br>
peptidomimetic. Generally, peptidomimetics of receptor-binding peptides bind to the<br>
receptor with high affinity and possess detectable biological activity (i,e,, are agonislic or<br>
antagonistic to one or more receptor-mediated phenotypic changes).<br>
	Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a<br>
D-amino acid of the same type (e.g.. D-lysine in place of L-tysine) may be used to generate<br>
more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or<br>
a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods<br>
known in the art (Rizo. et al.. Ann. Rev. Biochem., 61 ;387 (1992). incorporaied herein by<br>
reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming<br>
intramolecular disulfide bridges which eyelize the peptide.<br>
	"Detectable label" refers to materials, which when covalently attached to the<br>
peptide compounds of this invention, permit detection of the peptide compounds in vivo in<br>
the patient to whom the peptide compound has been administered. Suitable detectable<br>
labels are well known in the art and include, by way of example, radioisotopes, fluorescent<br><br>
of the label at the amount of label employed. Selection of the label relative to such factors<br>
is well within the skill of the art.<br>
	Covalent attachment of the detectable label to the peptide compound is<br>
accomplished by conventional methods well known in the art. For example, when the 125<br>
radioisotopc is employed as the detectable label, covalent attachment of 125 to the peptide<br>
compound can be achieved by incorporating the amino acid tyrosine into the peptide<br>
compound and then iodinating the peptide compound (see. e.g.. Weaner, el at.. Synthesis<br>
and Applications of Isotopically Labelled Compounds, pp. 137-140 (1994)). Incorporation<br>
of tyrosine to the N or C terminus of the peptide compound can be achieved by well known<br>
chemistry. Likewise. 42P can be incorporated onto the peptide compound as a phosphate<br>
moiety through. for example; a hydrosyl group on the peptide compound using<br>
conventional chemistry.<br>
	II. Overview<br>
	The present invention provides peptide compounds that bind to and activate the<br>
TPO-R-or otherwise behave as a TPO agonist. These peptide compounds include "lead"<br>
peputie compounds and "derivative" peptide compounds constructed so as to have the<br>
same or similar molecular structure or shape as the lead peptide compounds but that differ<br>
from the lead peptide compounds either with respect to susceptibility to hydrolysis or<br>
prolealysis and/or with respect to other biological properties, such as increased affinity for<br>
the receptor. The present invention also provides compositions comprising an effective<br>
amount of a peptide compound, and more particularly a peptide compound, that ia useful<br>
for treating hematological disorders, and particularly, thromboeytopenia associated with<br>
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transfusions.<br>
	It was found that the eore peptide compound can comprises a sequence of amino<br>
acids (SEQ ID NO:2): X9 X8 G X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7. where X6 may be 3-(2-<br>
naphthyl)alanine and where X9 is A, C,E, G, I, L . M, P, R, Q, S, T, or V; and X8 is A. C.<br>
D, E. K. L. Q.R S. T, or V, More preferably, X9 is A or I: and X8 is D, E, or K. Further<br>

13<br><br>
X4 is any of the 20 genetically coded L-amino acids; X5 is A, D, E, G, K, M, Q, R, S, T, V<br>
or Y: and X7 is C, G, I, K, L, M, N, R or V.<br>
	However, as described funher herein, it has been found that by replacing Xo with -<br>
(2-naphthyl)alanine the compound provides different properties from the compound<br>
containing -(1 -naphthyl)alanine. Accordingly, a particularly prefrred peptide includes<br>
the amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:7): I E G P T I. R Q (2-Nal) LAA R(Sar).<br>
	In another embodiment, the peptide compounds of the present invention are<br>
preferahly dimcrized or oligomerized to increase the affinity and/or activity of the<br>
compounds. An example of a preferred dimerized peptide compound includes, but is not<br>
limited to. the following:<br><br>
where X10 is a sarcosine or -alanine residue (SEQ ID NO:7). It should be noted that one<br>
X10 residue can be sartosine and the other residue can be -alaninc. The above structure<br>
can also be represented by the following: (H-IEGPTIRQ(2-Nal)LAARX10))2K-NH2.<br>
	A preferred peptide compound is as follows:<br><br>
wherein (2-Nal) is -(2-naphthyl)alanine and (Sar) is sarcosine (SEQ ID NO;7), This<br>
peptide compound is referred to herein as "TPO Compound No. 1"<br>
14<br><br>
	Peptide compounds having an IC50 of greater than about 100 mM lack sufficient<br>
binding to permit use in either the diagnostic or therapeutic aspects of this invention.<br>
Preferably, for diagnostic purposes, the peptide compounds have an IC50 of about 2 mM or<br>
less and for pharmaceutical purposes, the peptide compounds have all lC50 of about 100<br>
pM or less.<br>
	Fig. 1 compares the activity of three different batches of TPO Compound No, 1<br>
with one batch of prior art peptide compound using standard relative luminescent units<br>
assay techniques. The assay employs murine cells engineered to stably express the human<br>
TPO rcctptor and a fuciferase reporter construct driven by the fos promoter. The<br>
differcnce between TPO Compound No. 1 and the prior art peptide compound is that the<br>
prior art peptide compound has a (1-naphthyl)alanine (1 -Nal) where the (2-Nal) is on<br>

the same level of activity as the un-PEOylated prior art peptide compound. The remaining<br>

increased the number of circulating platelets in a dose-dependent manner with increases<br>
relative 10 the control group observed at doses as low as 30ug/kg for both compounds. At<br>
the maximal response, these peptide compounds elevated platelet counts to levels that were<br>
up to 4-fold greater than control values. The dose-response curves for these peptide<br>
compounds were very similar indicating that in this model there was essentialiy no<br>
difference between the two test articles based on these endpoints.<br>
	IV. Preparation of Peptidc Compounds<br>
		A. Solid Phase Synthesis<br>
	The peptide campounds of the invention can be prepared.by classical methods<br>
known in the art. for example, by using standard solid phase techniques. The standard<br>
methods include exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis methods,<br>
fragment condensation, classical solution synthesis, and even by recombinant DNA<br>
technology. See, e.g., Merrifield, J. Am. Chem.Soc, 85:2149 (1963), incorporated herein<br>
by reference. On solid phase, the synthesis is typically commenced from the C-terminal<br>
end of the peptide using an alpha-ami no protected resin. A suitable starling material can be<br>
prepared, for instance, by attaching the required alpha-amino acid to a chloromethylated<br>
resin, a hydroxymelhyl resin, or a benzhydrylamine resin. One such chloromethylated<br>
resin is sold tinder the tradename BID-BEADS SX-1 by Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond,<br>
CA. and the preparation of the hydioxymethyl resin is described by Bodonszky, et al.<br>
Chem. ind. (London), 38;l597 (1996). The benzhydrytaminc (BHA) resin has bcen<br>
16<br><br>
described by Pietta and Marshall, Chem. Commn 650 (1970) and is commercially<br>
available from Reckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., in the hydrochloride form.<br>
	Thus, the peptide compounds of the invention can he prepared by coupling an<br>
alpha-ammo piousted amino acid to the chloromethylated resin with the aid of, for<br>
example, cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according to the method described by (Hsin. Helv.<br>
Chim. Acta., 56:1467 (1973). After the initial coupling, the alpha-amino protecting group<br>
is removed by a Choice of reagents including trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric<br>
acid (MCI) solutions in organic solvents at room temperature.<br>
	The alpha-amino protecting groups are those, known to be useful in the art of<br>
step wise synthesis of pe prides. Included are acyl type protccting groups (e.g., formyl,<br>
trifluoroaceiyl. acetyl). aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g., benzyloxycarboyl<br>
(Cbz) and subsututed Cbz), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g.. t-butyloxycarbonyl<br>
(Boc). isopropyloxycarbonyl. cyclohcxyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl type protecting groups<br>
(e.g.. benzyl, tr.phenylmethyl). Boc and fmoc are preferred protecting groups. The side<br>
chain prolecting group remains intact during coupling and is nol split off during the<br>
deprolection of the aumino-terminus protecting group or during coupling. The side cham<br>
protecting group must be removable upon the completion of the synthesis of the final<br>
peptide and under reaction conditions that will not alter the target neptidc.<br>
	The sida- chain protecting groups for Tyr include tetrahydropyranyl. tert-butyl,<br>
trityl, benzyl, Cbz. Z.-Br--Cbz., and 2.5-diehlorobenzyl. The side chain protccting groups<br>
for Asp include benzyl. 2.6-dichlorohonzyl methyl. ethyl, and cyclohexyl. The side chain<br>
protecting groups fur Thr-and Ser include acetyl, benzoyl, trityl. tctrahydropyranyl, benzyl,<br>
2.6-dichlorobenzyl, and Cbz. The side chain protecting group for Thr and Ser is benzyl.<br>
The side chain protecting groups for Arg include nitro, Tosyl (Tos), Cbz.<br>
adamantyloxycarbonyl meaitoylsulfonyl (Mts), or Boc. The side chain protecting groups<br>
for Lys includt Cbz, 2-chlofobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-CI—Cb2), 2-bromobetuyloxycarbpnyI<br>
(2-BrCbz) Tos, or Boc.<br>
	After removal of the alpha-ammo protecting group, the remaining protected amino<br>
acids are coupled step wise in the desired order. An excess of each protected amino acid is<br>
17<br><br>
generally used with an appropriate csrboxyl group activator such as<br>
dicydohexytearbodiimide (DCC) in solution, for example, in methylene chloride<br>
(CH2Cl2). dimethyl formarnide (DMF) mixtures.<br>
	After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the desired peptide is<br>
decoupled from the resin support by treatment with a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid or<br>
hydrogen fluoride (HF). which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin, but also cleaves<br>
all remaining side chain protecting groups. When the chloromethylated resin is used,<br>
hydrogen fluoride treatment results in the formation of the free peptidc acids. When the<br>
bcnzhydrylarnine resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results directly in the free<br>
peptide amide. Alternatively, when the chtoromelhylated resin is employed, the side chain<br>
protected peptide can be decoupled by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give<br>
the desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylaminc to give a side chain protected<br>
ailkylamide or dialkylamide. Side chain protection is then removed in the usual fashion by<br>
treatment with hydrogen fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or dialkylamides.<br>
	These solid phase peptide synthesis procedures arc well known in the art and<br>
further described by John Morrow Stewart and Janis Dillaha Young, Solid Phase Peptide<br>
Syntheses (2nd Ed., Pierce Chemical Company. 1984).<br>
B. Synthetic Amino Acids<br>
	These proeedures can also be used to synthesize pcptidcs in which amino acids<br>
other than the 20 naturally occurring, genetically encoded amino acids are substituted at<br>
one. two, or more positions of any of the compounds of the invention. One can replace<br>
the naturally occurring side chains of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (or D amino<br>
acids) with other side chains, for instance with groups such as alkyl. lower alkyl, cyclic 4-,<br>
5-. 6-, to 7-membered alkyl amide, amide lower alkyl amide di(lower alkyl), lower<br>
alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy and the lower ester detivatives thereof. and with 4-, 5-; 6-, to 7-<br>
membered hetercocyclic. In particular, prolinc analogs in which the ring size-of the proline<br>
residue is changed from 5 members.to 4, 6, or 7 members can be employed. Cyclic groups<br>
can be saturated or.unsaturatcd, and if unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic.<br>
Heterocyclic groups preferably contain one or more nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulphur<br>
18<br><br>
heteroatoms. Examples of such groups include the furazanyl furyl, imidazolidinyl.<br>
imidazolyl. imidazolinyl, isothiazolyl. isoxazolyl, morpholinyl (e.g. morpholino). oxazolyl<br>
piperazinyl (e.g. 1-piperazinyl), piperidyl (e.g. I-piperidyl, piperidino) pyranyl pyrazinyl.<br>
pyrazolidinyl. pyrazolinyl, pyrazolyl pyridazinyl. pyridyl. pyriinidinvi. pyrrolidinyl (e.g.<br>
l-pyrrolidinyl), pyrrolinyl pyrrolyl, thiadizoly.thiazolyl, thienyl. thiomorpholinyl(e.g.<br>
thiomorphinol), and triazolyl. These heterocyclic groups can be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted. Where a group is subslituted. the .substituted can be alkyl. alkoxy. halogen-<br>
oxygen or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl<br>
	One can also readily modify the peptides of the instant invention by<br>
phosphorylation (see. e.g. W. Bannwarth. et al. Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry<br>
Letters, 6(17);2141-2146 (1996)), and other methods for making peptide derivatives of the<br>
compounds of the present invention are described in Hruby. et al., Biochem. J..<br>
268(2):249-262 (1990). Thus, the peptide compounds of the invention also serve as a basis<br>
to prepare peptide mimetics with similar biological activity.<br>
		C Terminal Modifications<br>
	Those of skill in the art recognize that a variety of techniques art available for<br>
constructing peptide compounds with the same or similar desired biological activity as the<br>
corresponding peptide compound but with more favorable activity than the peptide<br>
compound with respect to solubility, stability, and susceptibility to hydrolysis and<br>
proleolysis. See. for example, Morgan, et al. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem,, 24:243-252 (1989),<br>
The following describes methods for preparing peptide compounds modified al the N-<br>
terminal amino group, the C-terminal carboxyl group, and/or changing one or more of the<br>
amido linkages in the peptide to a non-amido linkage. It being understood that two or more<br>
such modifications can be coupled in compound compound structure (e.g. modification at<br>
the C-terminal carboxy) group and inclusion of a-CH2 -carbamate linkage between two<br>
amino adds in the peptide compound).<br>
		1. N-terminal Modifications.<br>
	The peptide compounds typically are synthesized as the free acid but, as noted<br>
above, could be readily prepared as the amide or ester. One can also modify the amino<br>
19<br><br>
and/or carboxy terminus of the peptide compounds of the invention to produce other<br>
compounds of the invention. Amino terminus modifications include methylation.<br>
acetylation, adding a benzyioxycarbonyl group, or blocking the amino terminus with any<br>
blocking group containing a carboxylate functionality defined by RCOO— where R is<br>
selected from the group consisting of naphthyl acridinyl, steroidyl and similar groups.<br>
Carboxy terminus modifications include replacing the free acid with a carbuxamide group<br>
of forming a cyclic XXXat the carboxy terminus to introduce structural constraints.<br>
	Amino terminus modifications are as recited above and include alkylating,<br>
acctylating, adding a carbobenzoyl group, forming a sucinimide group, etc. (See, eg,.<br>
Murray,et.al., Burgier'.s Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery. 5th .ed., Vol. 1. Manfred<br>
iWolf ed John Wiley and Sons, Inc. (1995),) Specifically, theN-terminal amino group<br>
can then be reacted as follows;<br>
(a) to form an amide group of the formula RC(O)NH- where R is as defined above by<br>
reaction with an acid halide or symmetric anhydride- Typically, the reaction can be<br>
conducted, by contacting about equimolar or excess amounts (e.g.. about 5 equivalents) of<br>
an acid halide to the peptide in an inert diluent (e.g. dichloromethane) preferably<br>
containing an excess (e.g.. about 10 equivalents) of a tertiary amine. such as<br>
diisopropylethylamine, to scavenge the acid generated during reaction. Reaction conditions<br>
are otherwise conventional (e.g., room .temperature for 30 minutes). Alkylation of the<br>
terminal amino to provide for a lower alkyl N-substitution followed by reaction with an<br>
acid halide as described above will provide for N-alkyl amide group of the formula<br>
RC(O)NR-;<br>
(b) to form a sucinimide group by reaction with succinic anhydride. As before, an<br>
approximately equimolar amount or an excess of succinic anhydride (e.g.. about 5<br>
equivalents) can be employed and line amino group is converted to the succinimide by<br>
methods well known in the art including the use of an excess (e.g.. ten equivalents) of a<br>
tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine in a suitable inerl solvent (e.g..<br>
dichloromethane), See, for example. Wollenberg, et al U.S. Pal, No. 4.612,132 which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It is understood that the succinic group can<br>
20<br><br>
be substituted with, for example, alkyl or —SR substiiuems which are prepared in a<br>
conventional manner to provide for substituted succintmide at the N-terminus of the<br>
peptide. Such alkyl substituents are prepared by reaction of a lower olefin with maleic<br>
anhydride in the manner described by Wollenberg, et al., supra and -SR substituents are<br>
prepared by reaction of RSl-1 with maleic anhydride where R is as defined above;<br>
(c) to form a benzyloxycarbonyl-NH- or a substituted benzyloxycarbonyl-NI I— group by<br>
reaction with approximately an equivalent amount or an excess of CBZ—C] (i.e.,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl chloride) or a substituted CBZ--CI in a suitable inert diluent (e.g.,<br>
dichloromethane) preferably containing a tertiary amine to scavenge the acid generated<br>
during the reaction;<br>
(d) to form a sulfonamide group by reaction with an equivalent amount or an excess (.e.g.,<br>
5 equivalents) of R—S(O)2 Cl in a suitable inert diluent (dichloromethane) to convert the<br>
terminal amine into a sulfonamide where R is as defined above. Preferably, the inert<br>
diluent contains excess tertiary amine (e.g.. ten equivalents) such as<br>
diisopropylethylamine. to scavenge the acid generated during reaction. Reaction conditions<br>
are otherwise conventional (e:g.. room ternperature for 30 minutes);<br>
(e) to form a carbomate group by reaction with an equivalent amount or an excess (e.g.. 5<br>
equivalents) of R-OC(O)Cl or R-OC(O)OC6 H4 -p-NO2 in a suitable inert diluent (e.g,<br>
dichloramethane) to convert the terminal amine into a carbamate where R is as defined<br>
above. Preferably, the inert diluent contains an excess (e.g,, about 10 equivalents) of a<br>
tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine. to scavenge any acid generated during<br>
reaction. Reaction conditions are otherwise conventional (e.g., room temperature for 30<br>
 minutes); and<br>
(f) to form a urea, group by reaction with an equivalent amount or an excess (e.g., 5<br>
equivalents) of R—N=C=O in a suitable inert diluent (e.g., dichloromethane) to convert<br>
the terminal amine into a urea (i.e., RNHC(O)NH--) group where R is as defined above.<br>
Preferably, the inert diluent contains an excess (e.g.. about 10 equivalents) of a tertiary<br>
21<br><br>
amine. such as dirsoprapylethylamine.Reaction conditions are otherwise conventional<br>
(e.g.. room temperature for about 30 minutes).<br>
2. C-Terminal Modifications<br>
	In preparing peptide compounds wherein the C-terminal carboxyl group is replaced<br>
by an ester (i.e., -C(O)OR where R is as defined above), the resins used to prepare the<br>
peptide acids are employed, and the side chain protected peptide is cleaved with base and<br>
the appropriate alcohol, e.g.. methanol. Side chain protecting groups are then removed in<br>
the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to obtain the desired ester.<br>
	In preparing peptide compounds wherein the C-terminal carboxyl group is replaced<br>
by the amide — C(O)NR3R-1 a benzhydrylamme resin is used as the solid support for<br>
peptide synthesis. Upon completion of the synthesis, hydrogen fluoride treatment to release<br>
the peptidc from the support results diractly in the free peptide amide (i.e., the C-terminus<br>
is —C(O)NH2). Alternatively, use of the chloromcthytated resin during peptide synthesis<br>
coupled with reaction with ammonia to cleavo the side chain protected peptide from the<br>
support yields the free peptide amide and reaction with an alkyiamine or a dialkylamine<br>

22<br><br>
with or covalently coupled to one or more of a variety of hydrophilic polymers. It has<br>
been found that when the peptide compounds are den XXX with a hydrophilic polymer,<br>
their solubility and circulation half-lives are increased and their immunogeniety is<br>
masked. The foregoing can be accomplished with little, if any, diminishment in their<br>
binding activity. Nonproteinaceous polymers suitable for use in accordance with the<br>
present invention include, hut are nt limited in. polyalkylethers as exemplified by<br>
polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid,<br>
polyoxyalkenes polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrolidone, cellulose and cellulose<br>
derivatives, dextran and dextran derivatives, etc. Generally, such hydrophilic polymers<br>
have an average molecular weight ranging from about 500 to about 100.000 dallons. more<br>
preferably from about 2.000 to about 40.000 daltons and, even more preferably, from about<br>
5,000 to about 20,000 daltons. In preferred embodiments, such hydrophilic polymers have<br>
an average molecular weight. of about 5.000 daltons, 10,000 daltons and 20,000 daltons.<br>
	The peptide compounds of the invention can be derivatized with or coupled to such<br>
polymers using any of the methods set forth in Zallipsky, S'., Bioconjugate Chem.. 6:150-<br>
165 (1995); Monfstrdini. C,et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 6:62-69 (1995); U.S. Pat, No,<br>

	In a presently preferred embodiment, the peptide compounds of the present<br>
invention are derivatized with polyethylene glycol (PF.G)- PEG is a linear, water-soluble<br>
polymer of ethylene oxide repeating unit with two terminal hydroxyl groups. PEGs are<br>
classified by their molecular weights which typically range from about 500 daltons to<br>
about 40;000 daltons. In a presently preferred embodiment, the PEGs employed have<br>
molecular weights ranging from 5,000 daltons to about 20,000 daltons, PEGs coupled to<br>
the peptide compounds of the present invention can be either branched or unbranched.<br>
(See, e.g.. Monfardini. C, et al., Bioconjugate Chem,. 6:62-69 (1995)). PEGs are<br>
commercially available from Shearwater Polymers. Inc. (Huntsville Ala,) now part of<br>
Nektar Therapeutics (San Carlo. CA), Sigma Chemical Co. and other companies. Such<br>
PEGs include, but are not limited to, monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (MePEG-OH),<br>
23<br><br>
monomethoxy polyethylene glycol-suceinate (MePEG-S), monomethoxypolyethylene<br>
glycol-succirdmidyl succinate (MePEG-S-NHS), monomethoxy polyethylene glycol-amine<br>
(MePEG-NH2). monomethoxy polyethylene glycol-tresylate (MePEG-TRES), and<br>
monomethoxy polyethylene glycol-imidazolyl-carbonyl (MePEG-IM),<br>
	Briefly, in one embodiment. the hydrophilie polymer which is employed, e.g.,<br>
PEG. is preferably capped at one end by an unreactive group such as a methoxy or ethoxy<br>
group. Thereafter, the polymer is activated at the other end by reaction with a suitable<br>
activating agent, such as cyanuric halides (e,g,. cyanuric chloride, bromide or fluoride),<br>
diimadozle- an anhydride reagent (e.g., a dihalosuccinic anhydride, such as<br>
dibromosucinic anhydride), acyl azide, p-diazoiumbenzyl ether, 3-(p-diazoniumphenoxy)-<br>
2-hydroxypropylethcr) and the like. The activated polymer is then reacted with a peptide<br>
compound of the present invention to produce a peptide compound derivatized with a<br>
polymer. Alternatively, a functional group in the peptido compounds of the invention can<br>
be activated for reaction with the polymer, or the two groups can be joined in a concerted<br>
coupling reaction using known coupling methods. It will be readily appreciated that the<br>
peptide compounds of the invention can be derivatized with PEG using a myriad of other<br>
reaction schemes known to and used by those of skill in the art.<br>
	When thepeptide compounds are derivatized with.a hydrophilic polymer, their<br>
solubility and circulation half-lives are increased and their immunogenicity 'is decreased.<br>
The foregoing can be accomplished with little, if any. loss in biological activity. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the derivatized peptides have an activity that is 0,1 to 0.01 -fold<br>
that of the unmodified peptides. In more preferred embodiments, the derivgtized peptides<br>
have an activity that is 0.1 to 1-fold that of the unmodified peptides. In even more<br>
preferred embodiments; the derivatized peptides have an activity that is greater than the<br>
unmodified peptides,<br>

24<br><br>
models for non-peptidte compounds with similar biological activity. Those of skill in the<br>
art recognize that a variety of techniques are available for constructing compounds with the<br>
same or similar desired biological activity as the lead peptide compound but with more<br>
favorable activity than the lead with respect to solubility, stability, and susceptibility to<br>
hydrolysis and proteolysis. See Morgan, et al.. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., 24:243-252 (1989),<br>

 understanding tyhe biological role, of TPO, including ths evaluation of the many factors<br>
thought to influence, and be influenced by, the production of TPO and the receptor binding<br>
process, The present peptide compounds are also useful in the development of other<br>
compounds that bind to and activate the TPO-R because the present peptide compounds<br>
provide important information on the relationship between structure and activity that<br>
should facilitate such development.<br>
25<br><br>
	The peptide compounds are also useful as: competitive binders in assays to screen<br>
for new TPO receptor agonists. In such assay embodiments, the peptide compounds of the<br>
invention can be used without modification or can be modified in a variety of ways; for<br>
example, by labeling, such as covalently or non-covalently joining a moiety which directly<br>
or indirectly provides a detectable signal. In any of these assays, the. materials thereto can<br>
be labeled either directly or indirectly. Possibilities for direct labeling include label groups<br>
such as radiolabels such as XXX. enzymes (U.S. Pat. No. 3,645.090) such as peroxidase and<br>
alkine phosphatase. and fluorescent lables (U.S. Pat. No. 3,940,475) capable of<br>
monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity, wavelength shift, or fluorescence<br>
polarization. Possibilities for indirect labeling include biotinylation of one constituent<br>
followed by binding to avidin coupled to one of the above label groups. The peptide<br>
compounds may also include spacers or linkers in cases where die peptide compounds are<br>
to be attached to a-solid support.<br>
	Moreover, based on their ability to bind to the IPO receptor. ihe peptide<br>
compounds of the present invention can be used as reagents for detecting TPO receptors on<br>
living cells, fixed cells, in biological fluids. in tissue homogenates. in purified, natural<br>
biological materials, etc. For example, by labelling such peptide compounds, one can<br>
identify cells having TPO-R on their surfaces. In addition, based on their ability to bind the<br>
TPO receptor, the peptide compounds of the present invention can be used in in situ<br>
staining, FACS (fluorescene-activated cell sorting), Western blotting, El,ISA. etc. In<br>
addition, based on their ability to bind to the TPO receptor, the peptide compounds of the<br>
present invention can be used in receptor purification, or in purifying cells expressing TPO<br>
receptors on the cell surface (of inside permeabilized cells).<br>

expansion of megakaryocytes and their committed progenitors, both in conjunction with<br>
additional cytokines or on their own. See, e.g., DiGiusto, et al., PCT Publication No.<br>
95/05843, which is incorporated herein by reference. Chemotherapy and radiation<br>
therapies cause thrombocytopenia by killing the rapidly dividing, more mature population<br>
of megakaryocytes. However, these therapeutic treatments can also reduce the number and<br>
viability of the immature less mitetically active megakaryocyte precursor cells. Thus,<br>
amelioration of the thrombocytopenia by TPO or the peptide. compounds of the present<br>
invention can be hastened by infusing patients post chemotherapy or radiation therapy with<br>
a population of his or her own tells enriched for megakaryocytes and immature precursors<br>
by in vitro culture.<br>
	The peptide compounds of the invention can also be administered to warm blooded<br>
animals, including humans, to activate the TPO-R in vivo. Thus, the present invention<br>
encompasses methods for therapeutic treatment of TPO related disorders that comprise<br>
administering a peptide compound of the invention in amounts sufficient to mimic the<br>
effect of TPO on TPO-R. in vivo. For example, the peptide compounds of the invention can<br>
be administered to treat a variety of hematological disorders, including but not limited to<br>
XXX disorders and thrombocytopenia, particularly when associated with bone marrow<br>
transfusions, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.<br>
