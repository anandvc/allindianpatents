				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a duct structure provided on the wall surface of a storage space of a refrigerator for transferring cold air to the interior of the storage space.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
FIG 1 is a sectional view showing the interior constitution of a conventional refrigerator. As shown in the figure, an outer case 2 forms an outer surface of the refrigerator, while an inner case 3 forms an inner surface of the refrigerator. An insulation material is filled between the outer and inner cases 2, 3 to form an insulation layer 5.<br>
An interior space of a refrigerator body 1 of which the inner surface is formed by the inner case 3 forms is partitioned into freezing and refrigerating chambers 9, 10 by a barrier 7. Each of the freezing and refrigerating chambers 9, 10 is kept at a predetermined temperature and contains goods to be stored, Below the refrigerating chamber 10, there is provided a machine room 11 in which various components for performing a heat exchange cycle are installed. The freezing and refrigerating chambers 9, 10 are open at front sides thereof, which are selectively opened and closed by doors 12, 12', respectively. For reference, an inner surface of the door 12' for the refrigerating chamber 10 may be formed with a duct for supplying cold air to the interior of the refrigerating chamber 10.<br>
-2-<br><br>
A back side within the freezing chamber 9 is formed with a heat exchange chamber 14, and an evaporator 16 for generating the cold air is installed within the heat exchange chamber 14. The cold air generated from the evaporator 16 is supplied to the freezing and refrigerating chambers 9, 10 through several paths.<br>
A cold air supply duct 19 for supplying the cold air into the refrigerating chamber 10 is installed to a back side within the refrigerating chamber 10. Further, at a side wall of the refrigerating chamber 10, there is provided a side duct 20 for receiving the cold air through a cold air passage 18 formed in the interior of the barrier 7 and then supplying the cold air into the refrigerating chamber 10.<br>
FIG 2 shows a sectional structure of the side duct 20. As shown in the figure, the side duct 20 is mainly composed of a duct body 22 and a cover plate 27. The side duct 20 is installed to be vertically elongated in the side wall of the refrigerating chamber 10. Accordingly, the duct body 22 is formed to be vertically elongated, and a cold air flow path 23 of which a side corresponding to an engagement hole 3h formed in the side wall is open is provided in the duct body 22. Both ends of a portion in which the cold air flow path 23 of the duct body 22 is open are formed with vertically elongated flanges 24 in contact with the back side of the inner case 3, and fastening protrusions 25 protrude to face each other from a portion adjacent to portions at which the flanges 24 are formed.<br>
The cover plate 27 is engaged with the duct body 22 at a front side of the inner case 3 to cover the open portion of the cold air flow path 23. The cover<br>
-3-<br><br>
plate 27 is formed with a plurality of cold air discharge holes 28. Engagement hooks 29 are formed to protrude from the back side of the cover plate 27 so that they can be fastened to the fastening protrusions 25 of the duct body 22.<br>
The side duct 20 constructed as such is installed in such a manner that the duct body 22 is positioned at the back side of the inner case 3 and the cover plate 27 is then fastened to the duct body 22 through the engagement hole 3h at the front side of the inner case 3, before forming the insulation layer 5.<br>
However, the aforementioned prior art has the following problems:<br>
First, the duct body 22 and the cover plate 27 are fastened to each other only through the engagement hooks 29 and the fastening protrusions 25. However, due to manufacturing and assembly tolerance of the duct body 22 and the cover plate 27, there may be generated a problem in that the flanges 24 are not tightly sealed to the back side of the inner case 3. In such a case, upon forming of the insulation layer 5, a foam may be introduced into the cold air flow path 23 through between the flanges 24 and the back side of the inner case 3.<br>
In order to avoid the above problem, the flanges 24 and the inner case 3 have been conventionally bonded to each other by an adhesive tape, However, there is still a problem in that work for adhering the tape to the back side of the inner case 3 is very troublesome.<br>
In the meantime, the inner surface of the door 12' for the refrigerating chamber 10 is also substantially constructed as a wall surface of the refrigerating    . chamber 10. As shown in FIG 3, it may also be provided with a door duct for<br>
supplying   the cold air into the refrigerating chamber. That is, an insulation layer<br>
_-4 -<br><br>
12h is also formed between an outer case 12a and an inner case 12b of the door<br>
A transverse protrusion 32 is formed on the inner case 12b, i.e, an inner surface forming the wall surface of the refrigerating chamber 10. Since the transverse protrusion 32 is formed to protrude from the inner case 12b, a groove 32' is consequently formed on the back side of the inner case 12b. Here, the transverse protrusion 32 is constructed to form or support a door basket provided in the door 12'. A grille plate 33 is connected with the transverse protrusion 32 and inclined with respect to the inner case 12b. A plurality of discharge holes 33h are perforated in the grille plate 23.<br>
At the back side of the inner case 12b of the door, a space for forming a cold air flow path 38 is defined by the transverse protrusion 32 and the grille surface 33. To this end, a first insulation member 34 is installed with an end thereof fitted into a groove 32' of the transverse protrusion 32, and a second insulation member 35 is installed to define the cold air flow path 38 in cooperation with the first insulation member 34 and the grille plate 33. The first and second insulation members 34, 35 are fixed to the back side of the inner case 12b with a tape 36.<br>
However, when a door duct 30 constructed as such is installed to the door 12', the door 12' is thickened by a thickness of the insulation members 34, 35, and thus the refrigerator becomes bulky. Further, there is a problem in that it is   troublesome   to   manufacture   the door duct 30 since the tape 38 should be<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of a duct structure for a refrigerator according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 4 is a sectional view showing the constitution of a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, an insulation layer 105 is formed between outer and inner cases 101 and 102, which form outer and inner surfaces of a refrigerator body 100, respectively. The insulation layer 105 serves   to   prevent   any   heat   transfer between a storage space formed in the<br>
-10-<br><br>
interior of the refrigerator body 100, e.g. a refrigerating chamber, and the exterior thereof.<br>
Side ducts 110 are installed in the inner case 102 forming an inside wall of the refrigerating chamber 107 which is a storage space in the refrigeration body 100 constructed as such. The side ducts 110 are installed at portions of the inner case corresponding to both side walls of the refrigerating chamber 107 for supplying cold air to side portions of the refrigerating chamber 107. The side ducts 110 are formed to be elongated from the top to the bottom of the inside of the refrigerating chamber 107.<br>
Each of the side ducts 110 is largely composed of a duct body 120 and a cover plate 130, and the duct body 120 and the cover plate 130 are fastened to each other through an engagement hole 103 formed in the inner case 102.<br>
The duct body 120 is formed with a cold air flow path 122, which is a path where the cold air flows. The sectional shape of the duct body is not limited to that shown in the figure of the present embodiment. The entire portion of the cold air flow path 122 of the duct body 120 corresponding to the engagement hole 103 of the inner case 102 is open.<br>
Portions of the duct body 120 corresponding to both ends of the open portion are formed with flanges 124 contacting the inner case 102 and extending in directions opposite to each other. It is preferred that the flanges 124 have a predetermined width so that contact areas with the inner case 102 are kept to be<br>
-11-<br><br>
larger than a predetermined value. It is also preferred that the flanges 124 are formed over the entire duct body 120.<br>
Fastening protrusions 126 are formed at the inside of both ends of the open portion of the duct body 120. The fastening protrusions 126 extend in directions facing each other at both ends. The fastening protrusions 126 are used for fastening of the cover plate 130.<br>
The cover plate 130 has a length and a width capable of shielding the engagement hole 103 formed in the inner case 102. A plurality of cold air discharge holes 132 are perforated in the cover plate 130 in a longitudinal direction thereof. The cold air discharge holes 132 serve to transfer the cold air introduced through the cold air flow path 122 to each portion of the refrigerating chamber 107.<br>
Elastically engageable ribs 134 to be fastened to the duct body 120 installed in a space between the outer and inner cases 101 and 102 are formed on a back side of the cover plate 130. The elastically engageable ribs 134 are formed at both longitudinal ends of the cover plate 130. The elastically engageable ribs 134 are fastened to the fastening protrusions 126 of the duct body 120, respectively.<br>
Tip ends of the elastically engageable ribs 134 are provided with elastic arms 135, respectively, each of which extends toward the back side of the cover plate 130 and has predetermined elasticity. The elastic arms 135 are formed at the outside of the elastically engageable ribs 134 at both ends of the cover plate, and face   the  fastening   protrusions   126   of the duct body 120,<br>
-12-<br><br>
respectively. Tip ends of the elastic arms 135 are continously formed with a plurality of serrated grooves 136, respectively. Tip ends of the fastening protrusions 126 are seated in the serrated grooves 136 respectively. At this time, the elastic arms 135 are elastically deformed by the fastening protrusions 126 and are in a state of being compressed toward the elastically engageable ribs 134, respectively.<br>
The operation of the first embodiment of the present invention having the above constitution will be described below.<br>
Each of the side ducts 110 is assembled to the inner case 102 before forming the insulation layer 105. That is, the duct body 120 is seated in the back side of the inner case 102, and the cover plate 130 is fastened to the duct body 120 through the engagement holes 103 in the front of the inner case 102.<br>
At this time, the elastic arms 135 of the elastically engageable ribs 134 inserted into the cold air flow path 122 of the duct body 120 through the engagement holes 103 are guided along the fastening protrusions 126 of the duct body 120. In this process, the elastic arms 135 are in a state of being pressed toward the elastically engageable ribs 134, When the duct body 120 and the cover plate 130 are close to each other, the fastening protrusions 126 are seated in the serrated grooves 136 of the elastic arms 135 The elastic arms 135 are kept in the elastically deformed state.<br>
In a state where the duct body 120 and the cover ptate 130 are engaged with each other with the inner case 102 interposed therebetween, the flanges 124 should be in close contact with the back side of the inner case 102.<br>
-13-<br><br>
Here, the degree of close contact of the flanges 124 with the inner case 102 depends on the serrated grooves In which the fastening protrusions 126 are seated When the fastening protrusions 126 are seated in the serrated grooves 136 closer to the tip ends of the elastic arms 135, respectively, the flanges 124 come into closer contact with to the inner case 102.<br>
Next, FIG 5 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, an insulation layer 205 is formed between outer and inner cases 201, 202 which form outer and inner surfaces of a refrigerator body 200, respeciively. Further, an engagement groove 203 is formed to be depressed into the insulation layer 205. The groove 203 is formed in the inner case 202 to be elongated vertically.<br>
A side duct 210 is installed within the engagement groove 203. The side duct 210 is configured to match an inner surface of the groove 203 in view of their shapes. In this embodiment, the side duct 210 is formed such that a section of a duct body 220 thereof is rectangular. The duct body 220 is elongated to match the engagement groove 203 and is provided with a cold air flow path 222. A plurality of cold air discharge holes 224 are formed on a surface of the duct body 220 which faces the refrigerating chamber 207.<br>
In this embodiment, the side duct 210 is fixed into the engagement groove 203. In such a case, it is preferred that an adhesive material 230 be placed between the engagement groove 203 and the duct body 220 in order to prevent the side duct 210 from being inadvertently detached from the engagement groove 203.<br>
-14-<br><br>
Next, FIG. 6 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, the duct body 220 is formed with flanges 226 which come into close contact with an inner front surface of the inner case 202. The flanges 226 are formed vertically at both ends of the duct body 220 when viewing the duct body 220 from the refrigerating chamber 207. The duct body 220 with the flanges 226 formed therein is designed such that the flanges 226 come into close contact with the inner front surface of the inner case 202 when the duct body 220 is secured into the engagement groove 203 which is formed to be depressed into the inner case 202 in the same way as in the second embodiment.<br>
Further, in order to secure the duct body 220 into the engagement groove 203, screws 228 pass through the flanges 226 and are fastened to the inner case 202.<br>
The operation of the duct structure according to the second and third embodiments of the present invention constructed as such will be now explained. In these embodiments, the duct body 220 is installed within the engagement groove 203 of the inner case 202 after an insulation layer 205 has been previously formed. That is, the insulation layer 205 is first formed between the outer case 201 and the inner case 202, and the duct body 220 is then coupled into the engagement groove 203 depressed into the insulation layer 205.<br>
At this time, in the second embodiment, the adhesive material is placed into the engagement groove 203, and the duct body 220 is then fixed into the groove with the adhesive material applied thereto. Alternatively, in the third<br>
-15-<br><br>
embodiment, the duct body 220 is inserted into the engagement groove 203 and then fastened to the inner case 202 and insulation layer 205 by means of the screws 228 which pass through the flanges 226 coming into close contact with the inner case 202 and are screwed into the inner case 202 and insulation layer 205.<br>
Finally, FIG. 7 shows a. fourth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the figure, a door duct 310 is installed to an inner surface of a door 300 constructing a side wall of a refrigerating chamber 307 serving as a storage space.<br>
The door 300 is a part for selectively opening or closing the refrigerating chamber 307, and an outer case 301 forms a front outer surface of the door 300. An inner case 302 is coupled to the outer case 301 to form an inner surface of the door 300. Further, an insulation layer 303 is formed between the outer and inner cases 301, 302. The insulation layer 303 is a part for preventing any heat transfer through the door 300.<br>
In the inner case 302 of the door, first and second transverse protrusions 305, 305' protruding into the refrigerating chamber 307 are formed such that they are spaced apart from each other at a predetermined vertical interval. The transverse protrusions 305, 305' are formed to be elongated in a lateral direction when viewing the inner case 302 from within the refrigerating chamber 307. The first transverse protrusion 305 protrudes relatively more than the   second   transverse   protrusion   305'.   The first transverse protrusion 305<br>
-16-<br><br>
serves to either form a portion of a door basket provided in the door 300 or to support the door basket thereon.<br>
Between the first transverse protrusion 305 and the second transverse protrusion 305', a transverse depressed portion 306 is formed to be elongated in the lateral direction in the inner case 302. The transverse depressed portion 306 is formed in such a manner that a portion of the inner case 302 is caused to be depressed relatively. The transverse depressed portion 306 cooperates with the grille plate 320 to be described below so as to form a cold air flow path 330.<br>
A door duct 310 is formed in the transverse depressed portion 306 of the inner case 302. That is, the grille plate 320 is installed to cover an inlet of the transverse depressed portion 306. The grille plate 320 has a width and a length corresponding to those of the transverse depressed portion 306. The installation of the grille plate 320 onto the door inner case 302 can be made in a variety of configurations. For example, a structure by which a molded part can be fastened may be formed in the inner case 302 and the grille plate 320, respectively, so that they can be fastened to each other using fastening screws. Alternatively, the grille plate 320 may be formed integrally with the inner case 302. A plurality of discharge holes 322 for discharging the cold air into the refrigerating chamber 307 are perforated in the grille plate 320.<br>
Meantime, the cold air flow path 330 is formed by installing the grille plate 320 at the inlet of the transverse depressed portion 306. The cold air flow path 330 is connected to a cold air supply path formed in the refrigerator body on the side of one end of the inner surface of the door 300 and is supplied with the<br>
-17-<br><br>
cold air. The cold air supplied to the cold air flow path 330 is discharged into the refrigerating chamber 307 through the discharge holes 322.<br>
Alternatively, a plurality of the cold air flow paths 330 may be formed in the door 300.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of the fourth embodiment of the present invention constructed as such will be described. In this embodiment, the door duct 310 is provided in the door inner case 302 for substantially forming an inner wall of one side of the refrigerating chamber 307 by forming the inner surface of the door 300.<br>
To this end, the transverse depressed portion 306 is formed in the inner case 302 and the grille plate 320 covers the inlet of the transverse depressed portion 306 so that the cold air flow path 330 is formed in the transverse depressed portion 306. In the present embodiment, therefore, the grille plate 320 for forming the cold air flow path 330 can be installed at any time before and after formation of the insulation layer 303.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment the door duct 310 communicates at one side thereof with the cold air supply path formed in the refrigerator body and is supplied with the cold air. Then, the door duct 310 discharges the cold air through the discharge holes 322 toward the door 300 and the inlet of the refrigerating chamber 307.<br>
In the present invention constructed as such, since a separate insulation member for the formation of the cold air flow path 330 need not be used, the thickness of the door 300 at a portion in which the cold air flow path<br>
-18-<br><br>
330 is formed is prevented from being relatively increased. There is no need for a work of pre-assembling an insulation member and the like in order to form the cold air flow path 330.<br>
The duct structure according to the present invention described in detail above is constructed by forming the duct depressed into the wall surface of the storage space. Thus, a foam material for forming the insulation layer is not introduced into the duct, so that the duct can be more accurately installed and the duct is prevented from being clogged with the foam material.<br>
Further, since the foam material is not introduced into the duct, the insulation layer can be more firmly formed in the interior of the refrigerator body or door, Thus, the insulation characteristics of the refrigerator can be enhanced.<br>
According to the present invention, since there is no need for a pre-assembly work for applying a separate tape to the back side of the inner case upon installation of the duct body constructing the duct, the assembly work for the duct can be relatively quickly and easily performed.<br>
Moreover, according to the present invention, since any separate insulation material is not pre-assembled in the insulation layer when the duct is formed to be depressed into the wall surface of the storage space, the thickness of the wall forming the insulation layer can be minimized so that the storage space of the refrigerator can be maximized or the overall size of the refrigerator can be reduced.<br>
