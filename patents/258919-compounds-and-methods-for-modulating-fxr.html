COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10, rule 13)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
“COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR MODULATING FXR”<br><br><br><br><br><br>
ELI LILLY AND COMPANY, a corporation of the State of Indiana, United States of America, having a principal place of business at Lilly Corporate Center, City of Indianapolis, State of Indiana 46285, United States of America<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br><br><br><br><br>
COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR MODULATING FXR<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The current invention relates to the fields of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine.  Specifically, the invention relates to novel compounds useful for the treatment dyslipidemia and diseases related to dyslipidemia.<br>
	Dyslipidemia and diseases related to dyslipidemia e.g. atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, stroke, etc., are major causes of death, morbidity, and economic loss. Plasma lipids, especially cholesterol fractions, are recognized as having a significant role in cardiovascular health.  Favorable modulation of plasma lipids such as triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol is desirable.<br>
Numerous efforts are underway to provide safe and efficacious molecular entities for the treatment of diseases related to dyslipidemia.  For example, patent application WO 2004/048349 A1 discloses compounds purportedly useful as farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists.  PCT international application WO2007/092751 A3 discloses isoxazole compounds useful for modulating FXR.  PCT International application WO 2007/140174 A2 discloses aryltriazole derivatives as FXR modulators and their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions, and use in the treatment of dyslipidemia and related diseases.<br>
FXR agonists are ligands for a nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of genes that control triglyceride, cholesterol, and carbohydrate metabolism.  The above efforts and others not withstanding, there remains a need to discover and develop compounds that are believed to be potent and efficacious (based on in-vitro and in-vivo models) agonists of FXR.  Such compounds would be useful for the treatment of disorders characterized by or resulting from an undesirable lipid profile including dyslipidemia and related diseases e.g., atherosclerosis. <br>

	The compounds of the invention (formula I, Ia or II) may be prepared by the combination of a variety of stepwise procedures known in the art including those described below.  Compounds of formula II are prepared according to the schemes below when U =O, R3a is absent, and W is C; or wherein an isoxazole ring is specifically being prepared. The products of each step in the schemes below can be recovered by conventional methods including extraction, evaporation, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, trituration, crystallization, and the like. In the scheme below all substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined and suitable reagents are well known and appreciated in the art. <br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br>
Scheme 1 depicts the reaction of an appropriate compound of formula (1) with an appropriate compound of formula (2) to give a compound of formula I or II where X is N.<br>
Thus, an appropriate compound of formula (1) in which R1, R2, R3a, R3b,q, and R5 are defined for formula I and Y is a leaving group and an appropriate compound of formula (2) is one in which R5, and Ar1 are as defined in formula (I) or a group which gives rise to R5 as defined in formula (I), for example, by formation of an ester, amide, sulfonamide, or acid are reacted to form the compound of formula (I) with appropriate protections and/or deprotections or other processing steps known to one of skill in the art or disclosed herein.  Suitable leaving groups are well-known in the art and include halides, particularly chloro, bromo, and iodo; and sulfonate esters, such as brosyl, tosyl, methanesulfonyl, and trifluromethane sulfonyl. <br>
	For example, a compound of formula (1) is reacted with a compound of formula (2) in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, methylethyl ketone and the like.  As will be readily appreciated an excess of a suitable base such as sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, potassium t-butoxide, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, triethylamine, diisopropyethylamine is usually used in the reaction.  Such reactions generally are carried out at temperatures from about room temperature to about the reflux temperature of the chosen solvent and typically use from about 1 to 2 equivalents of the compound of formula (2).  In addition, up to about 2 equivalents of a crown ether, 18-crown-6 for example, may be added to facilitate the reaction and a microwave is preferred as heating apparatus when R3b = iPr. Compounds wherein R5 is an ester can be converted to compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is an acid via methods well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.  For example, hydrolysis of simple alkyl esters in suitable solvents such as THF, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, water mixtures thereof at temperatures from about 25-100 oC with suitable bases including for example, NaOH, LiOH, and KOH.  In a modification of this hydrolysis method a microwave apparatus may be used as an energy/heat source, especially when the ester is sterically hindered.  For example a laboratory microwave utilizing the lowest power setting at about 125 C for about 20 minutes in solvent mixtures described above is useful.  When R5 is a t-butyl ester the corresponding acid can be formed under acidic conditions well known to those skilled in the art. <br>
	In an optional step, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I) or (II) is formed.  The formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts is well known and appreciated in the art.  See, e.g., P. Stahl, et al., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002; S.M. Berge, et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts, ”Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 66, No. 1, January 1977.<br>
As will be readily appreciated compounds of formula (1) and (2) can be readily prepared by methods that are well-known and established in the art including methods and procedures similar to those described herein.  For example, isoxazole compounds of formula (1) wherein U = O and W = C are prepared by the reaction of optionally substituted benzaldehydes with hydroxylamine in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine followed by chlorination with a suitable chlorinating agent, such as N-Chloro succinimide, to afford chloroximes (see for example J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43 (16), 2971-2974).  Reaction of the chloroximes and an appropriate beta-ketoester under basic conditions with a suitable base, such as triethylamine or sodium methoxide, affords the penultimate isoxazole esters.  The isoxazole esters may be reduced to the alcohol compounds of formula (1) with well known methods (e.g. DIBAL-H, LAH) and subsequently converted to a leaving group such as for example, a halide leaving group. <br>
Triazole compounds of formula (1) wherein U = W = N are prepared by the reaction of optionally substituted phenyl azide with an acetylene ester followed by reduction to a protected hydroxy acetylene and optionally conversion to a leaving group. <br>
Pyrazole compounds of formula (1) wherein U = CH and W = N are prepared by the reaction of optionally substituted phenyl hydrazine with a 1,3-diketoester (or an equivalent thereof) followed by reduction and optionally conversion to a leaving group. Compounds of formula (2) are prepared by carbon-nitrogen bond formation/coupling reactions. For example, reaction of an appropriate piperidine derivative with a fluorobenzene under nucleophilic aromatic substitution conditions in suitable solvents such as acetonitrile using a base such as potassium carbonate at temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent affords a compound of formula 2 wherein X is N; q is 1; and Ar1 is phenyl.  Alternatively, appropriate piperidines can be reacted with aryl halides under palladium mediated coupling conditions in solvents such as dioxane at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 120 oC to yield compounds of formula (2).  Alternatively, appropriate piperidines can be reacted with aryl halides under copper mediated coupling conditions in solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide at temperatures ranging from 85 ºC to 120 ºC to yield compounds of formula (2).  Also, it is recognized that the steps required to prepare a compound of formula (I) can be carried out in any order including, for example, reaction of a partial compound of formula (2) with a compound of formula (1), such that the later carried out carbon-nitrogen bond formation/coupling reaction provide a compound of formula I.  More specifically, a compound of formula (3) can be reacted with a compound of formula (1) as described above to afford compounds of formula (4) which, following deprotection, can be converted to compounds of formula (I) via carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions with compounds of formula (5) (Scheme 2).  Compounds of formula (5) may be purchased or prepared from purchased intermediates.  For example, the 6-bromoindole-3-carboxylic acid may be purchased and converted to the methyl or t-butyl ester derivative.  The 6-bromoindole-3-carboxylic acid, methyl ester derivative may be employed directly in the coupling reaction with the amine as described herein.  The 6-bromoindole-3-carboxylic acid, t-butyl ester derivative may be used in the C-N coupling reaction described herein or preferably, it may be converted to the iodo derivative using for example, NaI and CuI in the presence of a suitable base and solvent using procedures known to one of skill in the art.  Alternatively, the methyl ester derivative of 6-bromoindole-3-carboxylic acid may be used as the bromo.  A person skilled in the art will recognize that different protecting groups and or different leaving groups may be better suited to particular Ar1 substrates.  <br>
Also, one of skill in the art is aware that there are many methods for carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions including, for example, using copper (I) iodide and a suitable organic base, using a palladium catalyst such as Pd2(dba)3, in the presence of ligands such as S-Phos, X-Phos, or BINAP, using an inorganic base such as cesium carbonate, and a suitable solvent such as xylene to generate compounds of formula (I).<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
	Compounds of formula 3 wherein q is 2 are generally prepared from the commercially available azepan-4-one or protected derivative thereof.  The azepan-4-one is protected for example, as the t-butylcarbamate by reaction with di-t-butlydicarbonate to form the Boc-protected derivative.  The protected intermediate is then reduced to the alcohol under conditions well known in the art to afford the compound of formula 3 wherein q is 2.  One of skill in the art is able to access compounds of formula 3 following procedures disclosed herein and/or available in applicable reference sources.<br><br>
Scheme 3 depicts the reaction of an appropriate compound of formula (1) with an appropriate compound of formula (6) to give compounds of formula (I) where X = CH.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
Thus, an appropriate compound of formula (1) in which R1, R2, R3a, R3b,q, and R5 are defined for formula (I) and Y is a leaving group and an appropriate compound of formula (6) is one in which R5, X is CH and Ar1 are as defined in formula (I) or a group which gives rise to R5 as defined in formula (I), for example, by formation of an ester or acid are reacted to form the compound of formula (I) with appropriate protections and/or deprotections or other processing steps known to one of skill in the art or disclosed herein.  Suitable leaving groups are well-known in the art and include halides, particularly chloro, bromo, and iodo; and sulfonate esters, such as brosyl, tosyl, methanesulfonyl, and trifluromethanesulfonyl. <br>
	For example, a compound of formula (1) is reacted with a compound of formula (6) in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, methylethyl ketone and the like.  As will be readily appreciated, an excess of a suitable base is usually used in the reaction, including sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, potassium t-butoxide, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, triethylamine, diisopropyethylamine.  Such reactions generally are carried out at temperatures of about room temperature to about the reflux temperature of the chosen solvent and typically use from about 1 to 2 equivalents of the compound of formula (1).  <br>
	Additionally, compounds of formula (7) are converted to compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is an ester.  Thus, deprotection of compounds of formula (7) to yield intermediate phenolic compounds followed by reaction with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride affords intermediate triflates.  Such triflations are typically carried out in dichloromethane with pyridine as base at temperatures from -20 oC to RT.  The triflates can then be reacted with carbon monoxide in the presence of palladium acetate and 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane to give the carbonylated products of formula (I) wherein R5 is an ester. <br>
	Additionally, penultimate compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is an ester can be converted to compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is an acid or compounds of formula (II) as described above.<br>
	In an optional step, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I) is formed.  The formation of salts is well known and appreciated in the art.<br>
As will be readily understood compounds of formula (6) can be prepared by methods that are well-known and established in the art including methods and procedures similar to those described herein.  Compounds of formula (6) are prepared by carbon-carbon bond formation/coupling reactions.  For example, an appropriately substituted cyclohexanone alcohol can be converted to the vinyl triflate under well known conditions and subsequently converted to a vinylboronate.  The boronate can then be reacted with arylbromides for example under Suzuki conditions to afford the requisite arylcyclohexenes that can be reduced with hydrogen and catalytic palladium on carbon to afford compounds of formula (6). Also, it is recognized that the steps required to prepare a compound of formula (I) can be carried out in any order including, for example, reaction of a compound of formula (8) with a compound of formula (1).  More specifically, a compound of formula (8) can be reacted with a compound of formula (1) as described above to afford compounds of formula (I) where X = CH (Scheme 4).  Compounds of formula (8) can be prepared in a similar manner to compounds of formula (6) above.<br><br>

Preparation 43<br>
6-Bromo-benzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester<br>
Approach 1<br>
A solution of 6-Bromo-benzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylic acid (65 g, 252.8 mmole) and sulfuric acid (0.10 equiv; 25.3 mmol, 1.35 mL; 2.48 g) in ethanol (1.0 L) is heated at 65 ºC for 3 days.  The solution is cooled to room temperature.  The resulting light brown precipitate is filtered.  The filter cake is washed with methanol to afford the title compound (32 g, 44%).<br>
Approach 2<br>
Oxalyl chloride (717.2 g, 5.65 mol, 3.5 eq) is added to a 0-5 oC suspension of dichloromethane (3.44 L) and aluminum chloride (753.4 g, 5.65 mol, 3.5 eq).  The resulting suspension is stirred for 30-60 minutes at 0-5 °C and cooled -20 to -25 °C.  A solution of 6-bromobenzo[b]thiophene (344 g, 1.614 mol, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (1.72 L) is added over 1 h while maintaining the temperature at -20 to -25 °C.  The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at -20 to -25 °C and warmed to 18 to 20 °C using a warm water bath.  The reaction mixture is stirred for 1.5 h at this temperature.  The reaction mixture is filtered and the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (3 x 300 mL).  The combined filtrate is concentrated to yield a thick black oil in the flask (600 g). This residue is dissolved in dichloromethane (1 L) and added to ethanol (3.5 L) at -10 to 0 °C in portions at such rate to maintain temperature at 10 to 20 oC.  Once the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is partially concentrated to remove the dichloromethane only and then the vacuum is released.  The reaction mixture is heated to 60-70 °C and stirred at this temperature for 1 h.  Upon completion of the reaction, the solution is decanted from the resulting tars.  The tars are discarded.  The ethanol solution is evaporated to a residue.  The residue is diluted with EtOAc (2 L).<br>
At this point, the current reaction mixture is combined with reaction mixture from another batch of the reaction for further work up (started with 330 g of 6-Bromobenzo[b]thiophene, 1.549 mol).  The combined reaction mixture is poured into a stirred mixture of EtOAc (1 L) and brine solution (10 L).  The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with brine solution (2 L).  The combined aqueous layer is extracted with EtOAc (4 L).  The organic layer is washed with brine solution (1 L).  The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and charcoal, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure.  The resulting oil is further concentrated in a vacuum oven for 15 h at room temperature to afford waxy solids after drying (750 g).  The solids are suspended in heptane (5 L) with stirring and the suspension is heated to 70 °C.  Magnesium sulfate (300 g) is added and the resulting suspension is stirred for 10 minutes at 70 °C.  The suspension is filtered.  The solids are suspended in heptane (5 L) and heated to 70 °C.  The suspension is stirred for 10-20 minutes at this temperature and filtered.  The filter cake is washed with heptane (1 L).  The heptane filtrates are collected and concentrated under reduced pressure to give light brown solids (550 g).  The solids are dissolved in heptane (4 L) at 60 °C.  The resulting solution is cooled to 35 to 50 °C.  The solution is evenly loaded onto two plugs of silica gel (1.5 kg each) eluting with 0.5% EtOAc in heptane.  The pure product fractions are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure.  The impure product fractions are combined, concentrated, and purified as described above.  The total purified product is isolated (500 g) and crystallized from heptane (1.2 L).  The solids are collected by filtration, washed with cold heptane (200 mL, -20 °C), and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 15 h to afford the title compound (460 g, 51%).
