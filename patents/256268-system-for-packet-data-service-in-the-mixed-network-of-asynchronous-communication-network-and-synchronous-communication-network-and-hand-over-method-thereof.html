Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a handover method for packet data service in a<br>
mobile communication network in which asynchronous and synchronous networks coexist and,<br>
more particularly, to a mobile communication system and handover method thereof, which enable<br>
handover of a mobile communication terminal that is using a packet data service or is in a dormant<br>
state when a gateway general packet radio service support node of an asynchronous network<br>
connects to a packet data service node of a synchronous network in a mobile communication network<br>
in which the asynchronous and synchronous networks coexist<br>
Background Art<br>
With the development of mobile communication technology, a mobile communication<br>
network changes every generation. Currently, a network adopts a structure in which a synchronous<br>
mobile communication system (Code Division Multiple Access [CDMA] mobile communication<br>
system), designated as second generation or 2.5-th generation network, and an asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system (Wideband CDMA [WCDMA] mobile communication system), designated<br>
as a third generation network, coexist.<br>
Further, in order to support global roaming between mobile communication systems, a<br>
Dual-Band Dual-Mode (DBDM) mobile communication terminal capable of being used in both a<br>
synchronous mode system and an asynchronous mode system has been developed. By using the<br><br>
mobile communication terminal, different types of services can be used in asynchronous and<br>
synchronous mode system areas.<br>
Currently, an 'asynchronous mobile communication system is being constructed in areas<br>
having a great number of service requests, so that a synchronous mode mobile communication<br>
system has been developed into a form in which the service area thereof includes service areas of an<br>
asynchronous mode system. However, since the asynchronous mobile communication system is<br>
still in an initial stage and requires enormous investment to be implemented, the service cannot be<br>
provided to a wide area, so that the service area of an asynchronous mobile communication system<br>
overlaps with that of a synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
Accordingly, since the service area of the asynchronous mobile communication system is<br>
limited, there is a problem in that service is interrupted when a subscriber to the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system moves into a synchronous area, in which an asynchronous mobile<br>
communication service cannot be provided, during the use of the packet data service in an<br>
asynchronous area.<br>
Further, there is a problem in that service is interrupted when a subscriber to the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system, whose terminal is in a dormant state in an<br>
asynchronous area, moves into a synchronous area in which an asynchronous mobile communication<br>
service is not provided.<br>
In this case, "dormant state" means a state in which a mobile communication tenninal using<br>
a packet data service is in a disconnected state when the transmission/reception of data does not occur<br>
between the mobile communication tenninal and a mobile communication system, and can<br>
immediately make a transition to an active state when a data communication signal is generated. If<br>
a dormant state is not maintained at the time of handover from the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system to the synchronous mobile communication system, that is, if a packet data<br>
service is completely released, there is a disadvantage in that the mobile communication terminal<br><br>
must again perform a procedure of connecting to the synchronous mobile communication system<br>
from the beginning in order to use the packet data service, thus causing the deterioration of service<br>
quality, such as the increase of a connection time.<br>
As described above, if asynchronous and synchronous mobile communication systems<br>
coexist and the service area of the asynchronous mobile communication system is smaller than that of<br>
the synchronous mobile communication system, handover is required to provide continuous packet<br>
data service between the asynchronous and synchronous mobile communication systems.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems<br>
occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a mobile communication<br>
system and handover method thereof, which provides continuous packet data service when a mobile<br>
communication terminal using a packet data service in an asynchronous network moves into a<br>
synchronous network, thus preventing service interruptioa<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile communication system and<br>
handover method, which performs handover using mutual connection between a Gateway General<br>
packet radio service (GPRS) Support Node (GGSN) of an asynchronous network and a Packet Data<br>
Service Node (PDSN) of a synchronous network when a mobile communication terminal in a<br>
dormant state with respect to packet data service in the asynchronous network moves into the<br>
synchronous network, so that the mobile communication terminal remains in a dormant state even<br>
though the mobile communication terminal moves into the synchronous network, thus immediately<br>
starting the packet data service.<br><br>

the accompanying drawings<br>
FIG. 1 is a view showing the configuration of a mobile communication network according to<br>
the present invention, in which the mobile communication network is depicted on the basis of<br>
components used to provide a packet data service.<br>
A mobile communicarion terminal 10 applied to the present invention is a Dual-Band Dual-<br>
Mode (hereinafter referred to as DBDM) mobile communication terminal, which can be provided<br>
with both an asynchronous mobile communication service and a synchronous mobile<br>
communication service. The mobile communication terminal is selectively connected to an<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system 20 and a synchronous mobile communication system<br>
30 in a wireless manner, thus using voice and data services. A detailed description thereof will be<br>
described later with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
The asynchronous mobile communication system 20 includes a node B 210 functioning as<br>
a base station to perform wireless section communication with the mobile communication terminal<br>
10, a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 220 for controlling the node B 210, an asynchronous Mobile<br>
Switching Center (MSC) 230 connected to the RNC 220 to perform call switching so as to provide<br>
voice service to the mobile communication terminal 10, a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 240<br>
disposed between the RNC 220 and a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network 250 to track<br>
the location of the mobile communication terminal 10 and perform access control and security<br>
functions, and a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 260 connected to the SGSN 240 through the<br>
GPRS network 250 and connected to an IP network 40 to support interworking with external packets.<br>
Further, the synchronous mobile communication system 30 includes a Base Transceiver Station<br>
(BTS) 310 for supporting wireless section communication with the mobile communication terminal<br><br><br>
10, a Base Station Controller (BSC) for conlrolling the BTS 310 and a packet controller (Packet<br>
Control Function: PCF) 320 for perfonning a function similar to that of the BSC at the time of<br>
providing a packet data service, such as the management of radio resources for the packet data<br>
service, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 330 connected to one or more base station controllers to<br>
perform call switching, a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN) 340 connected to the packet controller<br>
320 to establish a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) session with the mobile communication terminal 10,<br>
interface with an external node, and perfonn a Foreign Agent (FA) function for the location<br>
registration of the mobile communication terminal 10 so as to provide a packet data service to a<br>
subscriber, a Data Core Network (DCN) (not shown) for supporting the interface between the packet<br>
data service node 340 and the IP network 40, a home agent 350 for authenticating the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 and transmitting packet data to a foreign agent, and an Authentication<br>
Authorization Account (AAA) unit 360 for performing authentication, authorization and account<br>
functions for the mobile communication terminal.<br>
Although not shown in the drawing, the MSCs 230 and 330 of the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system 20 and the synchronous mobile communication system 30 are connected to<br>
each other through a No. 7 common channel signaling network to transmit and receive information<br>
required for handover of the mobile communication terminal 10, etc. therebetween. Further, the<br>
GGSN 260 of the asynchronous mobile communication system 20 and the PDSN 340 of the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system 30 can transmit control signals and traffic through a<br>
Packet data-Packet data (P-P) interface. The P-P interface is an interface for communication<br>
between PDSNs in the synchronous mobile communication system, which is applied to<br>
communication with the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous mobile communication system, thus<br>
facilitating signal switching between asynchronous and synchronous networks.<br>
In such a mobile communication system, the mobile communication terminal 10 of the<br>
present invention is selectively connected to the asynchronous mobile communication system 20 and<br><br>
the synchronous mobile communication system 30 and transmits and processes signal processing<br>
status with respect to the two systems.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view of an example of a mobile communicalion tenninal applied to the present<br>
invention, which shows the case in which functional units for radio communication with<br>
asynchronous and synchronous networks are independently implemented.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a DBDM mobile communication terminal 10 applied to the present<br>
invention includes an antenna 110, an asynchronous mobile communication service module 120, a<br>
synchronous mobile communication service module 130 and a common module 140.<br>
The antenna 110 is capable of simultaneously processing frequency bands for synchronous<br>
and asynchronous mobile communication services.<br>
The asynchronous module 120 includes a duplexer 121 functioning as a band pass filter for<br>
separately processing individual frequencies, an asynchronous radio transmission/reception unit 122<br>
for separating transmission/reception radio waves into preset frequency bands, and an asynchronous<br>
modem unit 123 for processing wireless section protocol with an asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system. The synchronous module 130 includes a duplexer 131 functioning as a<br>
band pass filter for separately processing individual frequencies, a synchronous radio<br>
transmission/reception unit 132 for separating transmission/reception radio waves into preset<br>
frequency bands, and a synchronous modem unit 133 for processing wireless area protocol with a<br>
synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
The common module 140 includes an application processor that functions as a central<br>
processing unit for controlling the asynchronous modem unit 123 and the synchronous modem unit<br>
133 and performs a multimedia function, memory, an input/output unit, other application processing<br>
units, etc.<br>
Further, in the DBDM mobile communication terminal 10, software used for user interface,<br>
additional services, mobility management, connection/session control, resource control, and protocol<br><br>
processing is installed, thus allowing a user to use various application services, performing handover,<br>
and converting protocols according to mobile communication systems.<br>
In the mobile communication terminal according to this embodiment, the asynchronous<br>
modem unit 123 of the asynchronous module 120 and the synchronous modem unit 133 of the<br>
synchronous module 130 can be controlled by the common module 140. Further, either of the<br>
asynchronous and synchronous modem units 123 and 133 can control the entire mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view of another example of a mobile communication terminal applied to the<br>
present invention, which shows the case in which functional units for radio communication with<br>
asynchronous and synchronous networks are integrated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the DBDM mobile communication terminal 10 applied to the present<br>
invention includes an antenna 150, a duplexer 160, a multi-band radio transmission/reception unit<br>
170, amulti-mode modem unit 180 and some other processing module 190.<br>
The antenna 150 is capable of simultaneously processing frequency bands for synchronous<br>
and asynchronous mobile communication services.<br>
The duplexer 160 functions as a band pass filter for separately processing frequencies from<br>
the asynchronous network and frequencies from the synchronous network. The multi-band radio<br>
Iransmission/reception unit 170 separates transmission/reception radio waves into preset frequency<br>
bands. The multi-mode modem unit 180 processes wireless section protocol with the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system or the synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
The processing module 190 includes an application processor that functions as a central<br>
processing unit for controlling the multi-mode modem unit 180 and performs a multimedia function,<br>
memory, an input/output unit, other application processing units, etc.<br>
Further, in the DBDM mobile communication terminal 10, software used for user<br>
interfaces, additional services, mobility management, connection/session control, resource control,<br><br>
and protocol processing is installed, thus allowing a user to use various application services,<br>
performing handover, and converting protocols according to mobile communication systems.<br>
As described above, if the radio transmission/reception units and the modem units are<br>
integrated, several advantages can be realized, such as the reduction of the size of the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10, the reduction of power consumption and the sharing of modem<br>
memory.<br>
FIGS. 4A and 4B are conceptual views of handover for a packet data service in a mobile<br>
cominunication network in which asynchronous and synchronous networks coexist<br>
In a single mobile communication system, "handover" (or "handoff') means technology<br>
allowing a user to communicate without interruption when a mobile communication terminal moves<br>
from one cell of a mobile communication system to another cell thereof. The present invention relates<br>
to a handover method for a DBDM mobile communication terminal in a network in which<br>
synchronous and asynchronous mobile communication systems coexist Of the cases in which the<br>
mobile communication terminal 10 moves from a synchronous area B into an asynchronous area A,<br>
and in which the mobile communication terminal 10 moves from an asynchronous area A into a<br>
synchronous area B, the latter is described in detail.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4A, as the mobile communication terminal 10 that is connected to the IP<br>
network 40 through the node B 210, the SGSN 240 and the GGSN 260 and using a packet data service<br>
provided by the CP server 50 in the asynchronous area A approaches the synchronous area B through<br>
an overlap area C between the asynchronous and synchronous areas A and B, transmission/reception<br>
power between the node B 210 of the asynchronous mobile communication system and the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 gradually attenuates. The asynchronous mobile communication system<br>
that senses the power attenuation requests the synchronous mobile communication system to perfonn<br>
handover. The synchronous mobile communication system, having received the request, assigns a<br>
channel to the mobile communication terminal 10 so as to provide the packet data service.<br><br>
After channel assignment between the synchronous mobile communication system and the<br>
mobile communication terminal 10 has been completed, the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
system directs the mobile communication terminal to perform handover, thus performing handover to<br>
the synchronous mobile communication system. When the mobile communication terminal is<br>
completely connected to the synchronous mobile communication system, the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system notifies the asynchronous mobile communication system that handover has<br>
been completed. Accordingly, the node B 210 of the asynchronous mobile communication system<br>
releases the connection to the mobile communication terminal 10.<br>
In the present invention, since the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network and the PDSN<br>
340 of the synchronous network can transmit and receive control signals and traffic through a P-P<br>
interface, the mobile communication terminal 10 can continuously use the packet data service using the<br>
GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network if the mobile communication terminal 10 releases the<br>
connection to the node B 210 and connects to the BTS 310 of the synchronous network.<br>
Consequently, referring to FIG. 4B, the mobile communication terminal, handed over to the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system area B, is connected to the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system that is connected to the PDSN 340 through a P-P interface, via the BTS<br>
310, the PCF 320 and the PDSN 340, and can continuously use the packet data service provided by the<br>
CP server 50 through the IP network 40.<br>
This process is described in detail with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart of a handover method according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, which shows a handover method for a mobile communication terminal during the use of a<br>
packet data service when the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network is connected to the PDSN 340 of<br>
the synchronous network through a P-P interface.<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 10 using a packet data service in an asynchronous<br>
network moves into a synchronous network, the node B 210 of the asynchronous network determines<br><br>
that handover is required due to the power attenuation of transmission/reception to/from the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10, and notifies the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 of the requirement for handover<br>
(Serving Radio Network Subsystem: SRNS relocation required) at step S101. In this case, the<br>
identification number of the mobile communication terminal 10 is also transmitted, and the SGSN and<br>
GGSN 240 and 260 request the MSC 330 of the synchronous network to perform handover<br>
(FACDIR2)at step S102.<br>
Accordingly, the MSC 330 requests the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 310 to perform<br>
handover (Handoff request), and the BTS 310 performs a procedure of setting control signals and traffic<br>
to transmit packet data in the synchronous network. For this operation, the BTS 310 requests the<br>
packet controller (PCF) 320 to assign a channel (A9-selup) at step S104. Accordingly, the packet<br>
controller (PCF) 320 requests location registration from the Packet Data Service Node/Foreign Agent<br>
(PDSN/FA) 340, and receives location registration results (A11-Reg.Req/reply) at step S105. The<br>
PDSN/FA 340 requests location registration from the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 through the P-P interface<br>
and receives a reply to the location registration request (P-P Registration req/reply) at step S106, and<br>
then transmits channel assignment information to the BTS 310 (A9-connect) at step S107.<br>
As described above, when channel assignment is completed, the BTS 310 notifies the MSC<br>
330 that handover has been completed (Handoff Req. Ack) at step S108, and assigns a forward channel<br>
to the mobile communication terminal by transmitting a null frame to the mobile communication<br>
terminal through a forward fundamental channel (F-FCH) used for forward traffic transmission (F-FCH<br>
frames) at step S109.<br>
Further, the MSC 330, notified of the completion of the handover, notifies the SGSN/GGSN<br>
240/260 that handover has been completed (facdir2) at step S110, and the SGSN/GGSN 240/260,<br>
having received the notification, commands the node B 210 to perform handover (SRNS Relocation<br>
Command) at step S111.<br><br>
Thereafter, the node B 210 directs the mobile communication terminal to perform handover<br>
(HANDOVER FROM UTRAN CMD) at step S112. This direction message includes a message<br>
related to the synchronous mobile communication system, in particular, information about channel<br>
assignment The mobile communication terminal, having received the handover direction message,<br>
directs the synchronous module to prepare to communicate with the synchronous mobile<br>
communication, switches to a synchronous mode, and transmits frames(R-FCH frames) to the BTS 310<br>
of the synchronous mobile communication system through a reverse fundamental channel (R-FCH) at<br>
step S113. Thereafter, the mobile communication terminal notifies the BTS 310 that handover has<br>
been completed (HCM) at step S114. Accordingly, the connection between the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 and the synchronous mobile communication system 30 is achieved.<br>
Next, the BTS 310 performs a procedure for setting up a call with a packet network of the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system. If the BTS 310 requests the packet controller (PCF) 320<br>
to set up a call (A9-connected) at step S115, the packet controller (PCF) 320 requests location<br>
registration from the PDSN/FA 340, and receives location registration results (All-Reg. Req/reply) at<br>
step S116. Further, the PDSN/FA 340 requests location registration from the SGSN/GGSN 240/260<br>
through a P-P interface, and receives a reply to the location registration request (P-P Registration<br>
req/reply) at step S117.<br>
Thereafter, the packet controller (PCF) 320 notifies the BTS 310 that call setup has been<br>
completed (A-9 connected Ack) at step S118, and the BTS 310 notifies the MSC 330 that handover has<br>
been completed (handoff Complete) at step S119. The MSC 330 notifies the SGSN/GGSN 240/260<br>
that handover has been completed (Handoff Complete, MSONCH) at step S120. Then, the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260 requests the node B 210 to release the connection to the mobile communication<br>
terminal (Iu Release Cmd) at step S121.<br>
Accordingly, if service provided by the asynchronous mobile communication system 20 to<br>
the mobile communication terminal is released, the mobile communication terminal is connected to the<br><br>
GGSN through the BTS, the packet controller (PCF) and the packet data service node (PDSN), thus<br>
continuously using the packet data service provided by the CP server through the IP network.<br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B are conceptual views of handover of a mobile communication terminal in a<br>
dormant state in a mobile communication network in which asynchronous and synchronous networks<br>
coexist In this case, the case in which a mobile communication terminal 10 moves from an<br>
asynchronous area A into a synchronous area B is described as an example.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6A, in the asynchronous area A, the mobile communication tenninal<br>
establishes a session with the node B 210, is assigned a mobile IP and is in a dormant state in which, if a<br>
data signal is generated, the mobile communication terminal is connected to the IP network 40 through<br>
the SGSN 240 and the GGSN 260 to be able to use a packet data service provided by the CP server 50.<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 10 approaches the synchronous area B through an overlap area<br>
C between the asynchronous and synchronous areas A and B, the transmission/reception power<br>
between the node B 210 of the asynchronous mobile communication system and the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 gradually attenuates. The asynchronous mobile communication system,<br>
having sensed the power attenuation, or the synchronous mobile communication system, having sensed<br>
the approach of the mobile communication tenninal, notifies the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 of the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system that handover is required. Accordingly, the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260 commands the BTS 310 of the synchronous mobile communication system to<br>
perform handover, thus perfonning call setup and trunk setup between the mobile communication<br>
terminal and the synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
In the present invention, since the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network and the PDSN<br>
340 of the synchronous network can transmit/receive control signals and traffic therebetween through a<br>
P-P interface, the mobile communication terminal 10 can continue to use the mobile IP assigned by the<br>
GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network even through the mobile communication terminal 10 releases<br><br>
the connection to the node B 210 and connects to the BTS 310 of the synchronous network, so that<br>
there is no need to assign a new mobile IP in the synchronous network.<br>
Consequently, referring to FIG. 6B, the mobile communication terminal, handed over to the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system area B, remains in a dormant state with respect to the<br>
GGSN 260 of the asynchronous mobile communication system that is connected to the PDSN 340<br>
through a P-P interface, via the BTS 310, the PCF 320 and the PDSN 340.-<br>
As described above, the mobile communication terminal, handed over to the synchronous<br>
mobile communication system area B, remains in a dormant state with respect to the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system through the synchronous mobile communication system. Thereafter,<br>
if a data signal is generated, the mobile communication terminal makes a transition to an active state to<br>
immediately use a packet data service.<br>
This process is described in detail with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a handover method according to another embodiment of the present<br>
inventioa<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 10 in a dormant state in the asynchronous network<br>
area moves into the synchronous netwo± area, the node B 210 of the asynchronous network recognizes<br>
the attenuation of transmission/reception power to/from the mobile communication terminal 10,<br>
determines that handover is required, and notifies the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 of the requirement for<br>
handover, thus indicating that the mobile communication terminal is leaving the asynchronous network<br>
area (SRNS Relocation Required) at step S201. At this time, the identification number of the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 is also transmitted. Further, the step S101 of notifying the SGSN/GGSN<br>
240/260 of the requirement for handover can be performed by the BTS 310 of the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system that has sensed the approach of the mobile communication terminal.<br>
The SGSN/GGSN 240/260, notified of the requirement for handover, commands the BTS<br>
310 of the synchronous network to perform handover (SRNS Relocation Command) at step S202.<br><br>
Further, the node B 210 directs the mobile communication terminal to perform handover<br>
(HANDOVER FROM UTRAN CMD) at step S203. This direction message includes a message<br>
related to the synchronous mobile communication system, in particular, information about channel<br>
assignment, traffic channel entry, etc.<br>
Thereafter, the mobile communication terminal attempts to originate a call to the BTS 310<br>
using an Origination Message (ORM) (ORM [DRS = 1, AFN name]) at step S204. Accordingly, call<br>
processing and channel assignment are executed between the BTS 310 and the MSC 330. In detail,<br>
the BTS 310 transmits a service request message to the MSC 330 in response to the call origination<br>
attempt by the mobile communication terminal (Connection Management: CM Serv. Req.) at step<br>
S205. The MSC 330 requests the BTS 310 to assign a channel (Assign. Req.) at step S206, and the<br>
BTS 310, having received the channel assignment request, transmits a channel assignment message to<br>
the mobile communication terminal (ECAM: Extended Channel Assignment Message) at step S207.<br>
Next, a negotiation related to call processing and setup is performed between the mobile<br>
communication terminal (synchronous module) and the BTS 310 of the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system (negotiate and connect service) at step S208, and a trunk setup procedure is<br>
performed The trunk setup procedure can be performed through an A-interface. In detail, if the<br>
BTS 310 requests the packet controller (PCF) 320 to set up a trunk (A9 Setup-A8) at step S209, the<br>
packet controller 320 requests the PDSN 340 to set up a trunk (All RRQ) at step S210, and a<br>
connection is performed between the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 of the asynchronous network and the<br>
PDSN of the synchronous network (P-P setup) at step S211. The PDSN 340 transmits a reply signal<br>
to the trunk setup to the packet controller 320 (All RRP) at step S212. Thereafter, the packet<br>
controller 320 transmits the reply signal received from the PDSN 340 to the BTS 310 (A9 Connect-A8)<br>
at step S213.<br>
As described above, when the trunk setup is completed, the initialization of a Radio Link<br>
Protocol (RLP) is performed between the mobile communication tenninal and the BTS 310 (RLP<br><br>
initialization) at step S214. The BTS 310 notifies the MSC 330 that channel assignment has been<br>
completed (Assignment Complete) at step S215, thus enabling the mobile communication terminal to<br>
remain in a dormant state with respect to the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
system through the PDSN 340 of the synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
In the present invention, the PDSN 340 of the synchronous mobile communication system is<br>
connected to the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous mobile communication system through a P-P<br>
interface. Therefore, if the mobile communication terminal in a dormant state in the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system area moves into the synchronous mobile communication system area,<br>
the mobile communication terminal can remain in its dormant state using the mobile IP assigned by the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system without being assigned a new mobile IP.<br>

according to the present invention, which shows a user plane protocol stack applicable to the case in<br>
which a common module 140 is constructed to control a DBDM mobile communication terminal in the<br>
DBDM mobile communication terminal of FIG. 2.<br>
In the present invention, the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network is connected to the<br>
PDSN 340 of the synchronous network through a P-P interface, so that the GGSN 260 has a protocol<br>
for communication with the IP network 40, a protocol for communication with the SGSN 240 of the<br>
asynchronous network and a protocol for communication with the PDSN 340 of the synchronous<br>

and modulation, and an L2 layer for processing replies for the correct transmission of messages.<br>
In detail, the GGSN 260 includes an IP layer and a layer for the tunneling of the L2 layer in<br>
addition to the L1 and L2 layers so as to communicate with the IP network 40. Further, the GGSN<br>

Routing Encapsulation (GRE) layer for encrypting and compressing packets, and a High-level Data<br>
Link Control (HDLC) framing layer for performing link management for link connection and<br>
disconnection, synchronization problem solution, flow control, error control, etc., in addition to L1 and<br>
L2 layers, so as to communicate with the PDSN 340 through a P-P interface. Both the protocol stack<br>
for communication with the SGSN 240 and the protocol stack with the PDSN 340 further include a<br>
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) layer, thus performing packet compression, authentication, IP<br>
assignment, etc. in order to perform data communication.<br>
Next, the SGSN 240 is connected to the GGSN 260 through a Gn interface, includes an L1bis<br>
layer corresponding to the L1 layer and an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) layer for performing<br>
the generation, extraction and exchange of packet data to correspond to the L2 layer, so as to convert<br>
protocols used in the GGSN 260, and does not convert protocols with respect to data used in other<br>
higher UDP/IP and GTP-U layers.<br>
Further, the node B and the RNC 210 and 220 are connected to the SGSN 240 through an Iu<br>
interface, and include an L1 layer corresponding to the Llbis layer, a Media Access Control (MAC)<br>
layer for assigning radio resources, etc. for multimedia data processing to correspond to the ATM layer,<br>
a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer for establishing a radio link with the mobile communication terminal<br>
and combining and dividing packet data to correspond to the UDP/IP layer, and a Packet Data<br>
Convergence Protocol (PDCP) for compressing a packet data header, etc. to correspond to the GTP-U<br>
layer, so as to convert protocols used in the SGSN 240.<br>
Furthermore, the asynchronous modem unit 123 of the mobile communication terminal does<br>
not perfonn protocol conversion with respect to an L1 layer and includes an HDLC framing layer for<br>
performing link management for link connection and disconnection, synchronization problem solution,<br>
flow control, error control, etc. to correspond to the MAC/RLC/PDCP layers, so as to convert protocols<br><br>
used in the node B/RNC, and includes a PPP layer for receiving data through the PPP layer of the<br>
GGSN 260.<br>
In the meantime, the PDSN 340 is connected to the GGSN 260 through a P-P interface,<br>
includes an Llbis layer corresponding to the L1 layer and an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)<br>
layer for performing the generation, extraction and exchange of packet data to correspond to the L2<br>
layer so as to convert protocols used in the GGSN 260, and does not perform protocol conversion with<br>
respect to data used in other higher UDP/IP and GTP-U layers.<br>
Further, the BTS and PCF 310 and 320 are connected to the PDSN 340 through an A-<br>
interface (A10), and include an L1 layer corresponding to the Llbis layer, a Media Access Control<br>
(MAC) layer for assigning radio resources for multimedia data processing to correspond to the ATM<br>
layer, and an RLP layer, for requesting retransmission of erroneous frames to prevent the occurrence of<br>
errors in a wireless section, to correspond to the UDP/IP layer, so as to convert protocols used in the<br>
PDSN 340.<br>
Furthermore, the synchronous modem unit 133 of the mobile communication terminal does<br>
not perform protocol conversion with respect to an L1 layer and includes an HDLC flaming layer for<br>
performing link management for link connection and disconnection, synchronization problem solution,<br>
flow control and error control to correspond to the MAC/RLP layers, so as to convert protocols used in<br>
the BTS/PCF, and includes a PPP layer for receiving data through the PPP layer of the GGSN 260.<br>
Finally, the common module 140 of the mobile communication terminal includes an L1<br>
layer, a PPP layer, an IP layer, a transport layer and an application layer so as to convert protocols of<br>
data received from the asynchronous modem unit 123 and the synchronous modem unit 133.<br>
In this embodiment, it can be seen that both the asynchronous modem unit 123 and the<br>
synchronous modem unit 133 perform only a communication function, and the common module<br>
establishes protocols of higher PPP and IP layers.<br><br>
In the present invention, the GGSN of the asynchronous network is connected to the PDSN<br>
of the synchronous network through a P-P interface. Therefore, if the mobile communication terminal<br>
10 moves into a synchronous area while connecting to the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
system 20 using the asynchronous module 120 and utilizing a packet data service, the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 is assigned a channel for the packet data service by the synchronous<br>
network, and is then capable of continuously using the packet data service through the PDSN of the<br>
synchronous network and the GGSN of the asynchronous network, thus preventing service interruption<br>
from occurring at the time of handover of the mobile communication terminal<br>
Further, in the present invention, the GGSN of the asynchronous network is connected to the<br>
PDSN of the synchronous network through a P-P interface. Therefore, if the mobile communication<br>
terminal 10 moves into a synchronous area while the asynchronous module 120 of the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 is in a dormant state with respect to the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system, the mobile communication terminal 10 can remain in a dormant state to<br>
continuously use the packet data service.<br>
As described above, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be<br>
implemented with other embodiments without changing the technical spirit or essential features thereof.<br>
Therefore, the above-described embodiments should be appreciated as having been disclosed for<br>
illustrative purposes and are not restrictive. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the scope of the<br>
present invention is defined by the accompanying claims rather than the above detailed description, and<br>

Industrial Applicability<br><br>
As described above, a mobile communication system for a packet data service and handover<br>
method therefor in a mobile communication network in which asynchronous and synchronous<br>
networks coexist according to the present invention can provide continuous service through an interface<br>
between a GGSN of the asynchronous network and a PDSN of the synchronous network when<br>
handover occurs during the use of a packet data service using a dual-band dual-mode mobile<br>
communication terminal in a mobile communication network in which asynchronous and synchronous<br>
mobile communication systems coexist, thus improving the quality of service.<br>
Further, the present invention is advantageous in that it allows a mobile communication<br>
terminal to remain in a dormant state through the interlace between the GGSN of the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system and the PDSN of the synchronous mobile communication system<br>
without assigning a new mobile IP to the mobile communication terminal, in the case in which the<br>
mobile communication terminal in a dormant state in the asynchronous mobile communication system<br>
area moves into a synchronous mobile communication system area, thus allowing the mobile<br>
communication terminal to immediately react to the packet data service and consequently improving<br>
the quality of service.<br><br>

SYSTEM FOR PACKET DATA SERVICE IN THE MIXED NETWORK<br>
OF ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION NETWORK<br>
AND SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION<br>
NETWORK AND HAND-OVER<br>
METHOD THEREOF<br>
A mobile communication terminal and handover method therefor are disclosed. In the<br>
mobile communication system, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 260 of the<br>
asynchronous network is connected to a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN) 340 of the<br>
synchronous network. Accordingly, as a mobile communication terminal, using packet data<br>
service in the asynchronous mobile communication system 20, moves into an area of a<br>
synchronous mobile communication system 30, the synchronous mobile communication<br>
system 30 sets control signals and traffic to transmit packet data in response to a request<br>
from the asynchronous mobile communication system 20.</td>
