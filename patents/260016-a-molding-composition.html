				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a molding composition.<br>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising unbranched, thermoplastic polyamide, a phosphinic or diphosphinic salt, a nitrogen-containing flame retardant combination and also at least one oxygen-containing, nitrogen-containing or sulphur-containing metal compound and also to the production and the use of the inventive moulding compositions for production of fibres, of foils and of mouldings of any type.<br>
The chemical constitution of many plastics makes them readily combustible. Flame retardants therefore generally have to be added to plastics so that the high fiame-retardancy requirements set by plastics processors and sometimes by legislation can be achieved. To this end, there is a wide variety of known flame retardants and flame retardant synergists, and these are also commercially available. Non-halogenated flame retardant systems have been used with preference for some time because of more advantageous fire-related properties in relation to smoke density and smoke constitution.<br>
Among the non-halogenated flame retardants, salts of phosphinic acids (phosphinates) have proven particularly effective in particular for thermoplastic polymers (DE-A-2 252 258 and DE-A-2 447 727). Some derivatives of this class of flame retardant are of particular interest because they have very little adverse effect on the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic moulding compositions.<br>
Synergistic combinations of phosphinates with certain nitrogen-containing compounds, in particular with melamine derivatives, have moreover been found and are more effective than the phosphinates alone as flame retardants in very many polymers (WO-A 2002/28953, WO-A 97/01664 and also DE-A-197 34 437 and DE-<br>
A-197 37 727).<br>
It has also been found that the flame-retard ant action of the various phosphinates in thermoplastic polymers can be markedly improved via additions of small amounts of inorganic or mineral compounds which do not contain nitrogen, and that the additives mentioned also can improve the flame-retardant action of phosphinates in combination with nitrogen-containing synergists (EP-A 024 167 (= GB 8024901 A), WO-A 2004/016684)).<br>
When phosphinate-containing flame retardant systems are used, the result particularly at processing temperatures above 300째C was initially partial polymer degradation, discolouration of the polymer and evolution of fume during processing. These difficulties could, however, be suppressed via addition of basic or amphoteric oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, silicates, borates or stannates (WO-A 2004/022640).<br>
A particular continuing problem, however, is the behaviour of the thermoplastic moulding compositions equipped with phosphinate-containing flame retardant systems with regard to their IEC 60695-2 glow-wire resistance, in particular the IEC 60695-2-13 glow-wire ignition test ("GWIT"), in which the moulding composition in the form of a sheet is not permitted to ignite during contact with a glowing wire, "ignition" here having been defined as appearance of a flame for 5 s. This GWIT test is also a significant constituent of IEC 60335-1, which applies to certain components which are present in unattended household appliances and which carry electrical current or are subject to electrical potential, and demands materials whose GWIT classification is at least 775째C. Within ffiC 60335-1, a particularly demanding feature which is optional but demanded by many users is the glow-wire ignition test on the finished part, in which a flame can appear for at most 2s during contact of the component with a hot glow wire whose temperature is 750째C. However, because these finished parts have a wide variety of shapes and of designs, a high probability of success in the IEC 60335-1 finished part test is only likely if the underlying thermoplastic moulding composition also reproducibly gives no ignition with development of flame for 2s during the GWIT test on the sheet (IEC 60695-2-13) at glow-wire temperatures of at least 750째C and at various wall thicknesses.<br><br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide halogen-free, flame-retardant, thermoplastic polyamide moulding compositions based on phosphinate-containing flame retardant systems, where these also reproducibly give no ignition [no development of flame forat various wall thicknesses.<br>
Another object of the invention was that the balanced property profile known from the phosphinate-containing flame-retardant polyamide moulding compositions with regard to thermal and electrical properties, and also with regard to flame retardancy (UL94 V-0 starting at 0.8 mm) and mechanical properties (ISO 180 1/U IZOD impact resistance  45 kj/m2 and strength greater than 200 MPa) is also very substantially retained alongside improved glow-wire resistance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the EEC 60695-2-13 glow-wire resistance (GWIT) can be markedly improved in phosphinate-containing flame-retardant thermoplastic polyamides if the moulding composition comprises, in addition to the phosphinates, a specific combination composed of at least two different nitrogen-containing flame retardants and also of at least one oxygen-, nitrogen- or sulphur-containing metal compound of the second main or transition group. With this specific combination, the balanced property profile with regard to electrical, thermal and mechanical properties is very substantially retained.<br>
The invention therefore provides a thermoplastic moulding composition, comprising<br>
A)	from 20 to 97% by weight of an unbranched thermoplastic polyamide,<br>
B)	from 1 to 30% by weight, preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 5 to 15% by weight, based on the entire composition, of one<br>
or more phosphinic  salts  of the  formula (I)  and/or of one  or more<br>
diphosphinic salts of the formula (II) and/or polymers of these,<br><br><br>
R1 and R2 are identical or different and are hydrogen and/or linear or branched C1-Ce-alkyl and/or are aryl,<br>
R3       is linear or branched Ci-Cio-alkylene or Ce-Cio-arylene or is Ci-Cg-alkylarylene or aryl-Ci-Ce-alkylene,<br>
M is alkaline earth metals, alkali metals, aluminium, zinc, titanium, zirconium, silicon, tin and/or a protonated nitrogen base,<br>
C)       from   1   to  40%  by weight  of a nitrogen-containing  flame  retardant combination composed of<br>
Cl) from 0.1 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 10%, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 5%, based on 100% by weight of the entire composition, of melamine cyanurate and<br>
C2) at least 0.1 to 25% by weight, preferably from 1 to 15% by weight, particularly preferably from 2 to 10% by weight, based on 100% by weight of the entire composition, of another nitrogen-containing flame<br>
retardant which is not melamine cyanurate, preferably reaction products of melamine with phosphoric acid or with condensed phosphoric acids or, respectively, reaction products of condensates of melamine with phosphoric acid or with condensed phosphoric acids, particularly preferably melamine phosphate, melam polyphosphate, melon polyphosphate and melem polyphosphate, very particularly preferably melamine polyphosphate, and<br>
D) 0.1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.75 to 3.5% by weight, at least one oxygen-, nitrogen- or sulphur-containing metal compound, preferably of the second main or transition group, particularly preferably Ca, Mg and Zn, very particularly preferably zinc borate and zinc sulphide.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic moulding compositions can comprise not only components A) to D) but also E) from 0.01 to 5% by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 3% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 2% by weight, of at least one lubricant and/or mould-release agent.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic moulding compositions can comprise not only components A) to E) but also, or instead of E), component F) from 0.1 to 60% by weight, preferably from 1 to 50% by weight, particularly preferably from 10 to 40% by weight, of one or more fillers and reinforcing materials.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic moulding compositions can comprise not only components A) to F) but also, or instead of components E) and/or F), G) from 0.01 to 40% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 20% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 15% by weight, in each case based on the entire composition, of other additives.<br>
The total of the proportions of the components in each case gives a total of 100% by weight<br>
Surprisingly, the thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising components A), B), Cl), C2) and D) give the glow-wire resistance required by IEC 60695-2-13 and reproducibly give no ignition [no development of flame for &gt; 2s], and at the same time retain the balanced property profile known from phosphinate-containing flame-retardant polyamide moulding compositions.<br>
According to Hans Domininghaus in "Die Kunststoffe und ihre Eigenschaften" [Plastics and their Properties], 5th edition (1998), p. 14, are polymers which soften when heated and can be moulded almost in any desired manner, and whose molecular chains have either no side branches or else have varying numbers of relatively short or relatively long side branches.<br>
According to the invention, the compositions comprise, as component A), at least one unbranched thermoplastic polyamide. The inventive polyamides can be prepared by various processes and can be synthesized from a very wide variety of units, and in specific applications can be equipped with processing aids, stabilizers, polymeric alloy partners (e.g. elastomers) or else reinforcing materials (e.g. mineral fillers or glass fibres), alone or in combination, to give materials with specifically adjusted combinations of properties. Blends with proportions of other polymers, e.g. of polyethylene, polypropylene, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers) are also suitable, and it is possible here, if appropriate, to use one or more compatibilisers. The properties of the polyamides can be improved via addition of elastomers, e.g. in relation to the impact resistance of, for example, reinforced polyamides. The wide variety of possible combinations can give very many products with a very wide variety of properties.<br>
Very many procedures have been disclosed for preparation of polyamides, using, as a function of the desired final product, different monomer units and, respectively, various chain regulators to set a desired molecular weight, or else monomers having reactive groups for post-treatment intended subsequently.<br>
The industrially relevant processes for preparation of polyamides mostly proceed by way of polycondensation in the melt. In this context the hydrolytic polymerization of lactams is also regarded as polycondensation.<br>
Preferred polyamides are semicrystalline polyamides which can be prepared starting from diamines and dicarboxylic acids and/or lactams having at least 5 ring members or corresponding amino acids.<br>
Starting materials that can be used are aliphatic and/or aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic acid, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethyladipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, aliphatic and/or aromatic diamines, e.g. tetramethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, 1,9-nonanediamine, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine, the isomeric diaminodicyclohexylmethanes, diaminodicyclohexylpropanes, bisaminomethylcyclohexane, phenylenediamines, xylylenediamines, aminocarboxylic acids, e.g. aminocaproic acid and, respectively, the corresponding lactams. Copolyamides composed of a plurality of the monomers mentioned are included.<br>
Caprolactams are particularly preferably used, and e-caprolactam is very particularly preferably used.<br>
Other particularly suitable materials are most of the compounded materials based on PA6, on PA66 and on other aliphatic and/or aromatic polyamides and, respectively, copolyamides, where these have from 3 to 11 methylene groups for each polyamide group in the polymer chain.<br>
The polyamides prepared according to the invention can also be used in a mixture with other polyamides and/or with other polymers.<br>
The polyamides can comprise conventional additives, e.g. mould-release agents, stabilisers and/or flow aids, admixed while the material is still in the melt or applied to the surface.<br>
The inventive compositions comprise, as component B), one or more phosphinic salts of the formula (I) and/or one or more diphosphinic salts of the formula (II) and/or polymers of these, in which<br>
R  and R2 are identical or different and are hydrogen and/or linear or branched Ci-Ce-alkyl and/or are aryl,<br>
R3       is  linear or branched Ci-Cio-alkylene,  Ce-Cio-arylene  and/or is alkylarylene or aryl-Ci-Ce-alkylene,<br>

WO-A 97/39053 (= US 6 365 071) describes suitable phosphinates, and its content in relation to the phosphinates of the present application is incorporated herein by way of reference. For the purposes of the present invention, particularly preferred phosphinates are aluminium, calcium and zinc<br>

ji one preferred embodiment, the present invention also provides fibres, foils and nouldings which comprise, if appropriate, in addition to components A) to D), one )r more of components E) and/or F) and/or G).<br>
Finally, the present invention also provides a process for production of fibres, of foils and of mouldings, characterized in that moulding compositions are used which comprise components A to D) and also, in preferred embodiments, if appropriate, E), <br>
In order to demonstrate the improvements described according to the invention in flame retardancy and mechanical properties, compounding was first used to prepare appropriate plastics moulding compositions. To this end, the individual components were mixed in a twin-screw extruder (ZSK 32 Mega Compounder from Coperion Werner &amp; Pfleiderer (Stuttgart, Germany)) at temperatures of 270 to 335째C, extruded, cooled until they could be pelletized, and pelletized. After drying (generally two days at 70째C in a vacuum drying cabinet) the pellets were processed at temperatures of 270 to 300째C to give standard test specimens for the UL94V test, to give test specimens for the IEC 60695-2-12 glow-wire test and also to give test specimens for the mechanical tests to ISO 180/1U (IZOD impact resistance) and ISO 178 (flexural test), these being used to determine the fire properties of the inventive moulding compositions and also their mechanical properties.<br>
The flame retardancy of the moulding compositions was firstly determined by the UL94V method (Underwriters Laboratories Inc. Standard of Safety, "Test for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances", p. 14 to p. 18 Northbrook 1998).<br>
Glow-wire resistance was determined using the IEC 60695-2-12 GWFI (glow-wire flammability index) glow-wire test and also using the 60695-2-13 GWIT test (glow-wire ignition temperature) glow-wire ignition test. In the GWFI test, a glowing wire is used at temperatures of 550 to 960째C to determine, on 3 test specimens (e.g. 60 x 60 x 1,5 mm sheets), the maximum temperature at which an afterflame time of 30 seconds is not exceeded and no flaming drops come from the specimen. In the GWIT test, with a comparable test procedure, the glow-wire ignition temperature is stated, being higher by 25K (30K at 900째C to 960째C) than the maximum glow-wire temperature which in 3 successive tests does not cause ignition even during the time of exposure to the glow wire. Ignition here means a flame with flame time &gt;5 sec. In the light of IEC 60335-1, which, using a test comparable with IEC 60695-2-13 on the finished part (e.g. on a plug connecter which has been installed and is ready to use), at a glow-wire temperature of 750째C, permits only ignition with flame of duration at<br>
most 2 sec, the relative examples also give the maximum flame time for glow-wire exposure at 750째C for a period of 30 sec.<br>
Mechanical properties are obtained from impact resistance measurements IZOD (ISO 180/1U, 23째C) or from flexural experiments to ISO 178.<br>
The following materials were used in the experiments:<br>
Component A: nylon-6 (Durethan짰 B29, Lanxess Deutschland GmbH (Lanxess Group), Leverkusen, Germany)<br>
Component B: System of formula (I), where R1 = R2 = ethyl and M = aluminium [as in EP-A 803508 / EP-A 944637]<br>
Component   C/l:   melamine  cyanurate   (Melapur짰  MC25   from  CIBA,   Basle, Switzerland)<br>
Component C/2: melamine polyphosphate (Melapur짰 200/70 from CIBA, Basle, Switzerland)<br>
Component  D/l:   zinc borate  (Firebrake짰  ZB   from  Deutsche  Borax  GmbH, Sulzbach, Germany)<br>
Component D/2:  zinc sulphide (Sachtolith짰 HDS  from Sachtleben, Duisburg, Germany)<br>
Component E: N,N'-ethylenebisstearylamide<br>
Component F: CS 7928 chopped glass fibre from Lanxess Deutschland GmbH<br>
Component G: other additives<br>
where the total of proportions of the components is 100% by weight.<br><br>
(Table Removed)  1 to 3 show that the inventive specific halogen-free combination of components B), C/l), C/2) and D/l) (Inventive Example EE1, IE2 and IE3) represents a dramatic improvement over the prior art both with respect to flame retardancy (UI94 V-0, GWFI 960째C and GWIT 775째C) and also with respect to mechanical properties (impact resistance and flexural strength). The comparative examples moreover show that omission of component Dl cannot be compensated by feeding a larger amount of Cl (CE 1, 2 and 3) without facing resultant disadvantages in GWIT performance and mechanical properties. The same also applies for omission of Cl and use of a larger amount of Dl (CE 4 and 5). If both component Cl) and Dl) are omitted, although mechanical properties are retained at a high level, glow-wire ignition remains well below the requirements (CE 8). The characteristics described remain unaltered even if the proportion of the phosphinate component B and of the second nitrogen-containing component C2) is increased (CE <br><br><br><br><br><br>
