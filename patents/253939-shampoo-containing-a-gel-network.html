				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hair cleansing and conditioning shampoo containing a gel network comprising a fatty amphiphile.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the surrounding environment and from the sebum secreted by the scalp. The soiling of hair causes it to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. The soiling of the hair necessitates shampooing with frequent regularity.<br>
Shampooing cleans the hair by removing excess soil and sebum. However, shampooing can leave the hair in a wet, tangled, and generally unmanageable state. Once the hair dries, it is often left in a dry, rough, lusterless, or frizzy condition due to removal of the hair's natural oils and other natural conditioning and moisturizing components. The hair can further be left with increased levels of static upon drying, which can interfere with combing and result in a condition commonly referred to as "fly-away hair."<br>
A variety of approaches have been developed to alleviate these after-shampoo problems. These approaches range from post-shampoo application of hair conditioners such as leave-on and rinse-off products, to hair conditioning shampoos which attempt to both cleanse and condition the hair from a single product.<br>
In order to provide hair conditioning benefits in a cleansing shampoo base, a wide variety of conditioning actives have been proposed. However, many of these actives have the disadvantage of leaving the hair feeling soiled or coated and of interfering with the cleansing efficacy of the shampoo.<br>
Coacervate formation in a shampoo composition is known to be advantageous for providing conditioning benefits to the hair. The use of cationic polymers to form coacervate is known in the art, such as in PCT publications WO 93/08787 and WO 95/01152. However, these shampoo compositions are good for delivering wet hair conditioning but are not capable of delivering satisfactory dry hair smooth feel.<br>
Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a conditioning shampoo which can provide improved conditioning benefit for dry hair, while not interfering with the cleansing efficacy, nor providing negative feel to the hair when it is dried. Specifically,<br>
there is a need to provide long lasting moisturized feel, smooth feel, and manageability control to the hair when the hair is dried, yet not leave the hair feeling greasy, as well as to provide softness and ease of combing when the hair is wet.<br>
None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a shampoo composition comprising: (a) from about 5 % to about 50 % of one or more detersive surfactants, by weight of the shampoo composition; (b) a dispersed gel network phase comprising: (i) at least about 0.05 % of one or more fatty amphiphiles, by weight of the shampoo composition; (ii) at least about 0.01 % of one or more secondary surfactants, by weight of the shampoo composition; and (iii) water; and (c) at least about 20 % of an aqueous carrier, by weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
The present invention also is directed to a process of making the shampoo composition described above.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a method of using the shampoo composition described above.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

Additionally, among suitable nonionic surfactants are alkyl polysaccharide (APS) surfactants such as the alkyl polyglycosides. Such surfactants are described in U.S. Patent 4,565,647 to Llenado, issued January 21, 1986, which discloses APS surfactants having a hydrophobic group with about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms and polysaccharide (e.g., polyglycoside) as the hydrophilic group. Optionally, there can be a polyalkylene-oxide group joining the hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties.

Also among suitable nonionic surfactants are polyethylene glycol (PEG) glyceryl fatty esters, such as those of the formula R(O)OCH2CH(OH)CH2(OCH2CH2)nOH3 wherein n is from about 5 to about 200, preferably from about 20 to about 100, and R is an aliphatic hydrocarbyl having from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Any such surfactant known in the art for use in hair or personal care products may be used, provided that the additional surfactant is also chemically and physically compatible with the essential components of the composition, or does not otherwise unduly impair product performance, aesthetics or stability. The concentration of the additional surfactants in the composition may vary with the cleansing or lather performance desired, the optional surfactant selected, the desired product concentration, the presence of other components in the composition, and other factors well known in the art.<br>
Non-limiting examples of other anionic, zwitterionic,  amphoteric,  cationic, nonionic, or optional additional surfactants suitable for use in the compositions are described in McCutcheon's, Emulsifiers and Detergents, 1989 Annual, published by M. C. Publishing Co., and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,929,678; 2,658,072; 2,438,091; and 2,528,378. B.       Dispersed Gel Network Phase<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise a dispersed gel network phase comprising a fatty amphiphile. The gel network phase is included in shampoo compositions of the present invention to provide conditioning benefits. As used herein, the term "gel network" refers to a lamellar or vesicular solid crystalline phase which comprises at least one fatty amphiphile as specified below, at least one secondary surfactant as specified below, and water or other suitable solvents. The lamellar or vesicular phase comprises bi-layers made up of a first layer comprising the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant and alternating with a second layer comprising the water or other suitable solvent. The term "solid crystalline", as used herein, refers to the structure of the lamellar or vesicular phase which forms at a temperature below the chain melt temperature of the layer in the gel network comprising the one or more fatty amphiphiles, the chain melt temperature being at least about 27 °C. The chain melt temperature may be measured by differential scanning calorimetry, a method of which is described in the Examples below.<br>
Gel networks which comprise, for example, fatty alcohols have been used for years in cosmetic creams and hair conditioners. Such cosmetic creams and hair conditioners, however, typically contain very low amounts, if any, of detersive surfactant. Thus, such known products do not provide a combination of cleansing and conditioning to the hair or skin.<br>
Gel networks, generally, are further described by G.M. Eccleston, "Functions of Mixed Emulsifiers and Emulsifying Waxes in Dermatological Lotions and Creams", Colloids and Surfaces A: Physiochem. andEng. Aspects 123-124 (1997) 169-182; and by G.M Eccleston, "The Microstructure of Semisolid Creams", Pharmacy International, Vol. 7, 63-70 (1986).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the dispersed gel network phase is preformed. The term "pre-formed", as used herein, means that the mixture of the fatty amphiphile, secondary surfactant, and water or other suitable solvent is substantially a solid crystalline phase when added to the other components of the shampoo composition.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention, the gel network component of the present invention is prepared as a separate pre-mix, which, after being cooled, is subsequently incorporated with the detersive surfactant and the other components of the shampoo composition. More specifically, the gel network component of the present invention may be prepared by heating the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water to a level in the range of about 75 °C to about 90 °C and mixing. This mixture is cooled to a level in the range of about 27 °C to about 35 °C by, for example, passing the mixture through a heat exchanger. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant crystallize to form a solid crystalline gel network.<br>
Alternative methods of preparing the gel network component include sonication and/or milling of the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water, while these components are heated, to reduce the particle size of the melted fatty amphiphile phase. This results in an increase in surface area of the fatty amphiphile phase, which allows the secondary surfactant and the water to swell the fatty amphiphile phase. Another suitable variation in preparing the gel network includes heating and mixing the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant first, and then adding that mixture to the water.<br>
The cooled and pre-formed gel network component subsequently is added to the other components of the shampoo composition, including the detersive surfactant component. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that incorporation of the cooled and pre-formed gel network component with the detersive surfactant and other components of the shampoo composition allows the formation of a substantially equilibrated lamellar dispersion ("ELD") in the final shampoo composition. The ELD is a dispersed lamellar or vesicular phase resulting from the pre-formed gel network component substantially equilibrating with the detersive surfactants, water, and other optional components, such as salts, which may be present in the shampoo composition. This equilibration occurs upon incorporation of the pre-formed gel network component with the other components of the shampoo composition and is effectively complete within about 24 hours after making. Shampoo compositions in which the ELD is formed provide hair with improved wet and dry conditioning benefits. Further, the ELD does not form if the components which comprise the gel network component (i.e., the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant combined with water) are added as individual components together with the other components of the shampoo composition in one mixing step, and not as a separate cooled pre-formed gel network component.<br>
The presence of the gel network in the pre-mix and in the final shampoo composition in the form of the ELD can be confirmed by means known to one of skill in the art, such as X-ray analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Methods of X-ray analysis and differential scanning calorimetry are described in the Examples below.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of the fatty amphiphile to the secondary surfactant in the gel network component is greater than about 1:9, preferably greater than about 1:5 to about 100:1, more preferably greater than about 1:1 to about 50:1, and even more preferably greater than about 2:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The shampoo composition of the present invention comprise a gel network in an amount greater than about 0.1 %, preferably from about 1 % to about 60 %, and more preferably from about 5 % to about 40 %, by weight of the shampoo composition. 1.        Fatty Amphiphile<br>
The gel network component of the present invention comprises at least one fatty amphiphile. As used herein, "fatty amphiphile" refers to a compound having a<br>
hydrophobic tail group of RI as defined below and a hydrophilic head group which does not make the compound water soluble, wherein the compound also has a net neutral charge at the pH of the shampoo composition. The term "water soluble", as used herein, means that the material is soluble in water in the present composition. In general, the material should be soluble at 25° C at a concentration of 0.1 % by weight of the water solvent, preferably at 1%, more preferably at 5%, more preferably at 15 %.<br>
The fatty amphiphile of the present invention may be characterized as a compound having a Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance ("HLB") of 6 or less. The HLB, as used herein, is the standard HLB according to Griffin, J. Soc. Cosm. Chem., vol. 5,249 (1954).<br>
The shampoo compositions of the present invention comprise fatty amphiphile as part of the pre-formed dispersed gel network phase in an amount from about 0.05 % to about 14 %, preferably from about 0.5 % to about 10 %, and more preferably from about 1 % to about 8 %, by weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
According to the present invention, suitable fatty amphiphiles, or suitable mixtures of two or more fatty amphiphiles, have a melting point of at least about 27 °C. The melting point, as used herein, may be measured by a standard melting point method as described in U.S. Pharmacopeia, USP-NF General Chapter  "Melting range or temperature". The melting point of a mixture of two or more materials is determined by mixing the two or more materials at a temperature above the respective melt points and then allowing the mixture to cool.

E. Process of Making a Shampoo Composition<br>
An aspect of the invention relates to a process of making a shampoo composition of the present invention. The process of making a shampoo composition comprises (a) combining a fatty amphiphile, a secondary surfactant, and water at a temperature sufficient to allow partitioning of the secondary surfactant and the water into the fatty amphiphile to form a pre-mix; (b) cooling the pre-mix below the chain melt temperature of the fatty amphiphile to form a gel network; (c) adding the gel network to one or more detersive surfactants and an aqueous carrier to form a shampoo composition.<br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment of the present invention, the gel network component is prepared as a separate pre-mix, which, after being cooled, is subsequently incorporated with the other components of the shampoo composition. More specifically, the gel network component of the present invention may be prepared by heating the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water to a level in the range of about 75 °C to about 90 °C and mixing. This mixture is cooled to a level in the range of about 27 °C to about 35 °C by, for example, passing the mixture through a heat exchanger. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant crystallize to form a crystalline gel network.<br>
Alternative methods of preparing the gel network component include sonication and/or milling of the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and water, while these components are heated, to reduce the particle size of the melted fatty amphiphile phase. This results in an increase in surface area of the fatty amphiphile phase, which allows the secondary surfactant and the water to swell the fatty amphiphile phase. Another suitable<br>
variation in preparing the gel network includes heating and mixing the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant first, and then adding that mixture to the water. F.        Method of Use<br>
The compositions of the present invention are used in a conventional manner for cleansing and conditioning hair or skin, including scalp, face, and body. Generally, a method of treating hair or skin of the present invention comprises applying the composition of the present invention to the hair or skin. More specifically, an effective amount of the personal care composition is applied to the hair or skin, which has preferably been wetted with water, and then the personal care composition is rinsed off. Such effective amounts generally range from about 1 g to about 50 g, preferably from about 1 g to about 20 g. Application to the hair typically includes working the composition through the hair such that most or all of the hair is contacted with the composition.<br>
The method for treating the hair or skin comprises the steps of: (a) wetting the hair or skin with water; (b) applying an effective amount of the shampoo composition to the hair or skin, and (c) rinsing the applied areas of skin or hair with water. These steps can be repeated as many times as desired to achieve the desired cleansing and conditioning benefit.<br>
In one embodiment, the shampoo composition of the present invention advantageously is used to treat damaged hair. Damaged hair may include hair selected from permed hair, oxidatively colored hair, and mechanically damaged hair.<br>
hi another embodiment, the shampoo composition is used to treat skin, such as the scalp, the face, and the body.<br>

NON-LIMITING EXAMPLES<br>
The shampoo compositions illustrated in the following Examples illustrate specific embodiments of the shampoo compositions of the present invention, but are not intended to be limiting thereof. Other modifications can be undertaken by the skilled artisan without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. These exemplified<br>
embodiments of the shampoo composition of the present invention provide enhanced conditioning benefits to the hair.<br>
The shampoo compositions illustrated in the following Examples are prepared by conventional formulation and mixing methods, an example of which is set forth hereinbelow. All exemplified amounts are listed as weight percents and exclude minor materials such as diluents, preservatives, color solutions, imagery ingredients, botanicals, and so forth, unless otherwise specified. All percentages are based on weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
Preparation of the Gel Network Pre-Mix<br>
To prepare the gel network pre-mix, about 20% of the water is heated to about 74° C and the fatty amphiphile and the secondary surfactant (e.g., Behenyltrimethylammonium chloride (Varisoft BT-85) or Sodium Laureth Sulfate) are added to it. After incorporation, this mixture is passed through a mill and heat exchanger where it is cooled to about 35°C. As a result of this cooling step, the fatty amphiphile, the secondary surfactant, and the water form a crystalline gel network.<br>
For mixtures of different fatty amphiphiles, it may be beneficial to pre-mix the fatty amphiphile materials before incorporation into the water. This can be done by co-melting the different fatty amphiphiles together and utilizing this melt or cooling into a solid phase and incorporating this into the heated water along with the secondary surfactant. Another variation could be to co-melt the one or more fatty amphiphiles and the secondary surfactant before incorporation into the water. Some gel network compositions with chain melt temperatures between about 27°C to about 35°C will need to be cooled below 27°C to ensure the lamellar phase structure is froze.<br>
Gel Network Pre-Mix Examples 1-70<br>
The following Examples illustrate specific embodiments of the gel network pre-mix, prior to its incorporation with the detersive surfactant and other components of the final shampoo composition of the present invention.

Preparation of Final Shampoo Compositions<br>
To prepare the final shampoo composition, first, a surfactant solution pre-mix is formed. To prepare this surfactant solution pre-mix, about 6% to about 9% of sodium or ammonium laureth-3 sulfate, cationic polymers, and about 0% to about 5% of water are added to a jacketed mix tank and heated to about 74°C with agitation. To this solution, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, and disodium EDTA are added to the tank and allowed to disperse. Ethylene glycol distearate (EGDS) is then added to the mixing vessel and melted. After the EGDS was well dispersed (e.g., after about 10 minutes), preservative is added and mixed into the surfactant solution. This mixture is passed through a mill and heat exchanger where it is cooled to about 35°C and collected in a finishing tank. As a result of this cooling step, the EGDS crystallizes to form a waxy crystalline suspension. The mixture of these components is the surfactant solution pre-mix.<br>
Next, the surfactant solution pre-mix and the gel network pre-mix, which is prepared as described above, are mixed together. The remainder of the surfactants, perfume, dimethicone, sodium chloride or ammonium xylene sulfonate for viscosity adjustment, and the remainder of the water are added with ample agitation to ensure a homogeneous mixture. This mixture is the final shampoo composition which comprises as a dispersed phase the gel network pre-mix.<br>
Preferred viscosities of the final shampoo composition according to the present invention range from about 5000 to about 15,000 centipoise at 27°C, as measured by a Wells-Brookfield model RVTDCP viscometer using a CP-41 cone and plate at 2/s at 3 minutes.<br>
The pH may be adjusted as necessary to provide shampoo compositions of the present invention which are suitable for application to human hair, and may vary based on the selection of particular detersive surfactants, fatty amphiphiles, and/or other components.<br>

Differential Scanning Calorimetrv Method<br>
The chain melt temperature of the layer in the gel network comprising the one or more fatty amphiphiles (i.e., the melt transition temperature for the gel network) may be obtained using differential scanning calorimetry according to the following method. Utilizing a TA Instruments Q100 DSC, approximately 50 mg of the gel network pre-mix or the final shampoo composition containing the gel network is placed into a stainless steel high volume DSC pan. The sample, along with an empty reference pan is placed into the instrument. The samples are analyzed using the following conditions/temperature program: Nitrogen Purge, Equilibrate @ 5.00°C until an isothermal is reach for 2.00 min. Ramp the temperature at a rate of 3.00°C/min to 90.00°C. Each sample is analyzed in duplicate. The resulting DSC data is analyzed using TA Instruments Universal Analysis Software.<br>
The use of DSC to measure the melt transition temperature for gel networks is further described by T. de Vringer et al., Colloid and Polymer Science, vol. 265, 448-457 (1987); and H.M. Ribeiro et al., Intl. J. of Cosmetic Science, vol. 26,47-59 (2004).<br>
X-Ray Analysis Method<br>
Small-angle x-ray scattering ("SAXS") as used to resolve periodic structures in mesophases is essentially an x-ray diffraction technique. It is used in conjunction with conventional wide-angle x-ray diffraction ("WXRD") to characterize aggregate structures such as micelles, gel networks, lamella, hexagonal and cubic liquid crystals. The different mesophases that show periodic structures can be characterized by the relative positions (d-spacing) of their reflections as derived from the Bragg equation (d = A/2Sin 0) where d represents the interplanar spacing, A the radiation wavelength and 8 the scattering (diffraction) angle.<br>
The one dimensional lamella gel network phase is characterized by the ratio of the interplanar spacings d\/d\, di/da, di/ds, diAU, di/ds having the values 1:2:3:4:5 etc. in the SAXS region (long-range order) and one or two invariant reflections) in the WXRD region (short-range) centered around 3.5 and 4.5 A over a broad halo background. Other mesophases (e.g. hexagonal or cubic) will have characteristically different d-spacing ratios.<br>
WXRD data are collected in transmission mode on a Stoe STADI-P diffractometer equipped with an image plate position-sensitive detector. The specimen is positioned between two milar films in the sample holder and placed in the path of the x-ray beam. The IP detector has a solid angle of about 120° 20 and records diffracted x-ray beams simultaneously. Data are collected and analyzed using the XPOW software.<br>
SAXS data are collected on Rigaku rotating anode generator with a fine focus filament equipped with a HI-STAR 2-dimensional area detector from Bruker-AXS. The setup has an evacuated chamber, which houses the specimen, conjoined with an evacuated tube leading to the detector to reduce air scatter. The specimen sample holder consists of copper plates with small rectangular cavities to hold the fluid-like material and also allow the transmission of the x-ray beam. The openings to the cavities are sealed with kapton windows to provide leak-free environment under vacuum. The 2-D data are azimuthally integrated and reduced to intensity versus scattering vector (q) or its d equivalent by a combination of GADDS software and in-house software modules implementing known techniques on the Igor platform.<br>
