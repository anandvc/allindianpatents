				<td>NEW PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ENEAMIDE DERIVATIVES.<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the large-scale preparation of ene-amide derivatives useful as valuable substrates for asymmetric hydrogenation reaction and hence for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure amines derivatives known as key intermediates for active Pharmaceuticals.Several methods have been described in the prior art, for example in WO 99/18065 to prepare ene-amide precursors, but  these methods  are  clearly not  very  general  and unsuitable for large-scale production.The articles JOC, 1998, 63, p 6084 of the authors M. Burk and Coll. and JOC, 1999, 64(6), p 1775 of the authors X. Zhang and Coll. describe a process for ene-amide compounds synthesis comprising the reduction of oxime derivatives with iron metal in presence of acetic anhydride/acetic acid or acetic anhydride only.The US4194050 patent describes a process for ene-amide compounds synthesis comprising the reduction of oxime derivatives with ruthenium catalyst in presence of carboxylic anhydride.However, these processes show some limitations such as product decomposition under these conditions, use of co-solvent to facilitate product isolation, impure ene-amides which required arduous purifications and low to moderate yields.<br>
Prior art processes are unsuitable for large-scale production of ene-amide derivatives and hence not applicable to the commercial preparation of chiral amines via asymmetric hydrogenation.The process according to the invention presents the advantages of obtaining ene-amides in good yields, great facility of product isolation, an excellent chemical purity of product and reproducible process.The process according to the present invention is clearly suitable for the large-scale industrial production of amine derivatives, via an asymmetric or not hydrogenation reaction. These amine derivatives, asymmetric or not, are used as intermediates for active Pharmaceuticals preparation.The present invention relates to a new process for thepreparation of compounds of formula  (I),  comprising ahydrogenation-isomerization reaction of compound of formula(II) with an acyl derivative of formula (III) in presence ofa heterogeneous catalyst as shown in scheme(FigureREmoved)whereinRl and R2 and R3 are independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, a cycloalkyl, a cycloalkylalkyl, an alkylaryl, an aryl, a heterocycle, a cyano, an alkoxy, an aryloxy, a carboxyl, a carbamoyl, -CONR5R6 (in which R5 and R6 are independently an alkyl, arylalkyl, aryl group or R5 and R6 taken together may form a ring) or -COOR5 group (in which R5 is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylaryl or aryl group), said alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, alkylaryl and aryl groups being substituted or not with a functional group or with R5;or Rl and R2 taken together, may form a ring (which terms includes mono-, di- and higher polycyclic ring systems) , said ring being substituted or not with a functional group or with R5;<br>

Then acetic anhydride (13.7 g, 0.134 mole) is added at 20-25°C over a period of 15 minutes. The suspension is stirred for 1 hour and the catalyst 5% Rh/C (dry catalyst)(0.29 g, 4% by weight relative to oxime) is added. The mixture is heated to 30°C and the hydrogen flow is started. Hydrogenation is continued over a period of 15 hours under 4 bars hydrogen pressure. After the end of the reaction, the suspension is filtered from the catalyst and the catalyst is washed with THF. This solution is added on a mixture of water (21 ml) and NaOH 30% (30.4 g) at 5°C over a period of 1 hour and maintained at 20°C during 30 minutes. The aqueous phase is discarded and the organic layer is washed with water saturated with NaCl.THF is distilled under reduced pressure, replaced by toluene and concentrated under vacuum to give an oily brown residue of N- (3,4-Dihydro-naphthalen-2-yl) -acetamide (6.14 g, 74 %).Example Ib.

The suspension is stirred for 1 hour and the catalyst 5% Ir/C  (dry catalyst)(0.29 g, 4% by weight relative to oxime) is added. The mixture is heated to 70°C and the hydrogen flow is started.

Enamide from ft-tetralone with Ir /C 5.5 g (0.0341 mol) of 3,4-dihydro-lH-naphtalene-2-one oxime was dissolved in 42 ml of THF.Then 9.66 ml of acetic anhydride was added dropwise. The reaction mixture is stirred at a temperature between 20-30 °C during 2 hours. To this reaction mixture is added 0.44 g of the 5% Ir-carbon catalyts. Then the hydrogenation is carried out at a hydrogen pressure of 6 bars and at 75 °C during 3 hours. After the catalyst was filtered off, the filtrate was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 120 ml of toluene and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.
