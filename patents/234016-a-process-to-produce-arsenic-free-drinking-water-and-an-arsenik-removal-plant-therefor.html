				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for removal of arsenic from ground<br>
water and the apparatus used therefore.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rural population of India uses ground water specially tubewell water<br>
for drinking purpose. But groundwater has been frequently found to<br>
be contaminated with arsenic. Consumption of Arsenic contaminated<br>
water causes serious stomach and skin diseases. This is a very acute<br>
problem and several methods are being used to remove arsenic from<br>
arsenic Contaminated water. The used and known processes are not<br>
effective in removing Arsenic from contaminated water.<br>
Different technologies and processes to remove Arsenic from ground<br>
water are now available. The processes are (i) Co-precipitation (ii)<br>
membrane technology (iii) Adsorption technology (iv) distillation<br>
method and solar technology. According to co-precipitation<br>
technology the Arsenic contaminated water is treated with alum and<br>
the precipitate containing Arsenic is removed. But in this process<br>
removal of As III is not possible. According to another co-<br>
precipitation method Arsenic contaminated water is treated with<br>
Ferric Sulphate and precipitate-containing Arsenic is separated. In<br>
this method the efficiency of removal of arsenic is very low above pH<br>
7.5 yet another co-precipitate method is iron coagulation which is<br>
more efficient than alum treatment, but still removal of As III is<br>
medium. In the lime softening method lime is added to soften arsenic<br>
contaminated water. The addition of lime to soften Arsenic<br>
contaminated water requires adjustment of pH above 10.5.<br>
The technology generally cannot remove Arsenic III. It further<br>
requires oxidation and addition of other chemicals, which is a very<br>
complicated method and generates enough sludge.<br>
The second method is membrance technology, which includes<br>
Reverse Osmosis (RO), Nano Filtration (NF) and Electro Dialysis<br>
Reversal. Arsenic can be removed by this method. In addition other<br>
impurities are also removed. But the investment, operation and<br>
maintenance are very costly. Moreover the reject water is very toxic<br>
which affects the environment.<br>
The other method is adsorption technology. This method involves use<br>
of activated, iron coated sand and Iron exchange resin. Though the<br>
method is simple in operation and is less expensive, it cannot remove<br>
As III completely. Moreover, the method requires monitoring of<br>
breakthrough. In this method periodical regeneration and/or change<br>
of media and pH adjustment are necessary. Sulphate, TDS etc. can<br>
affect run length. Operation and maintenance of the technology are<br>
highly technical. It creates regeneration of highly concentrated waste.<br>
The solid waste is toxic and the media is cosily. In addition there are<br>
associated problems.<br>
The solar distillation method consists of basin and vacuum or multi-<br>
effect type. This technology can remove Arsenic having three<br>
valences, its operation and maintenance is simple, there is no need<br>
for chemicals, but its capacity is small. Addition of chemicals and<br>
microbial contaminants as part of the treatment process can also<br>
produce adverse effect. For example use of granulated activated<br>
carbon is known to be susceptible to microbial infestation.<br>
Besides, the disposal of the Arsenic removed from water can also<br>
become a major problem. Every technology will have a by-product<br>
that contains Arsenic. Other byproducts are produced after treatment<br>
of the Arsenic contaminated water. All by-products obtained after<br>
treating contaminated water are to be disposed of to avoid<br>
environment pollution.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a method and <br>
apparatus for the removal of Arsenic from water, which is simple and   <br>
cost effective.                                                                                             <br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a method and<br>
apparatus for the removal of arsenic from water, which brings down<br>
the level of arsenic below the permissible level for potable use.<br>
Another object of this invention to propose a method and apparatus <br>
for the removal of arsenic from water, which does not generate toxic <br>
sludge and the apparatus is virtually maintenance free.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the removal<br>
of arsenic from drinking water comprising passing arsenic<br>
contaminated water through an iron filter and thereafter through a<br>
container having ß-granular ferric hydroxide   to obtain arsenic free<br><br>
water.<br>
According to this invention is further provided an arsenic removal<br>
plant arsenic removal plant for removal of arsenic from ground water<br>
comprising a plurality of overhead water tanks (1) installed on a<br>
plurality of supporting structures (2) having a sheet cover (5); an<br>
automated lifting means constituting of an electric motor (10) and a<br>
force lift pump (10), optionally constituting of a hand tubewell (8) for<br>
lifting ground water contaminated with arsenic through a delivery pipe<br>
(6) to an upper one of said plurality of overhead water tanks (1); an<br>
iron filter (3) containing gravel/sand/manganese Di-oxide disposed<br>
above a lower one of said plurality of overhead water tank (1); an<br>
arsenic filter (7) interposed on an opposite face of said iron filter (3);<br>
raw water from said upper tank being first passed through said iron<br>
filter (3) and then through said arsenic filter (7) via a second delivery<br>
pipe fitted with a flow control valve and a water meter, the filtered<br>
arsenic-free water being accumulated in said lower tank provided at<br>
the bottom with a plurality of taps (9) for human consumptions.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the method for removal of Arsenic<br>
from ground water comprises lifting tube well water contaminated with<br>
Arsenic manually or by electric motor to an overhead tank to the<br>
required size passing the water through iron filter containing<br>
gravel/sand/manganese Di-oxide and then through another container<br>
having ß-Granular Ferric Hydroxide, the Arsenic filter on which As III<br>
and As V adsorbed wherein are fixed flow control valve and water<br>
meter and finally transmitting the filtered As III and As V free filtered<br>
water to the reserve tank below and direct delivery for human<br>
consumption.<br>
The ß-Granular Ferric Hydroxide used has a high specific surface 5-<br>
10 times higher efficiency for adsorption of Arsenic from water than<br>
other adsorbers.<br>
Because of this density and highly selective adsorption<br>
characteristics granular ferric hydroxide is used for effective removal<br>
of contaminants from natural as well as wastewater. The main<br>
application of this is the adsorptive removal of Arsenate and Arsenic<br>
binds on the Surface of ferric hydroxide by chemisorption process<br>
forming a stable surface complex therewith. The Granular Ferric<br>
Hydroxide does require chemical regeneration and does not produce<br>
any regenerate sludge.<br>
The residual mass of the spent ferric hydroxide is small and it poses<br>
no health risks to personal handling the material during installation or<br>
replacement. It conforms strictly with the standards for quality of<br>
drinking water.<br>
Of aH the known Arsenic removal systems the adsorption technique<br>
with Granular Ferric Hydroxide in fixed bed reactor is the most<br>
simple, safe and effective method for elimination of Arsenic from<br>
contaminated ground water. Depending on the concentration of<br>
Arsenic in raw water 50,000 bed volumes can be treated with<br>
Granular Ferric Hydroxide.<br>
Granular Ferric Hydroxide reactors are fixed adsorbers operating like<br>
conventional filters with a downward water flow. The technique aims<br>
at the combination of high Arsenic removal efficiency with the simple<br>
operation of the fixed bed adsorption. This technology is not only<br>
economical but also the most effective system as far as the efficiency<br>
in eliminating Arsenic from groundwater is concerned. It can find<br>
application for small requirements in rural areas in connection with<br>
hand tube wells as well as for larger requirements in towns in<br>
connection with community waterworks.<br>
The configuration is compact and easy-to-install. It can be easily and<br>
quickly connected to a hand tube well and does not require any<br>
skilled hand for installation. It consists only of a gravel filter followed<br>
by an adsorption tower filled at the top and down the gravel bed to be<br>
freed from the hand pump enters the first filter at the top and flow<br>
down the gravel bed to be freed from suspended particles contained<br>
in groundwater. The water exits at the bottom of the gravel filter and<br>
enters the adsorption tower at the top where it flows downwards<br>
through the AdsorpAs® bed. The Arsenic concentration in water will<br>
thereby brought down by AdsorpAs® to a level below the acceptable<br>
limits. There is no need to man the system round the clock. It cuts<br>
considerably down on operating and personal costs.<br>
The gravel filter of the ARP is to be back-washed two to four days to<br>
remove the suspended particles and iron from the top of the filter-bed<br>
which otherwise reduce the flow rate of water through the ARP. The<br>
frequency of back washing will depend on the quality of water treated.<br>
In order to back-wash the gravel filter, water from lift-pump is to be<br>
pumped for 6 to 7 minutes through the filter bed in the filter bed in the<br>
reverse flow direction by closing the normal operation.<br>
The back wash water from the gravel filter is led into a bucket, where<br>
a great part of the contaminants wiN be retained. The water drained<br>
out of the bucket contains less hazards than the groundwater itself.<br>
The invention wiU now be explained with the help of the<br>
accompanying drawings where Fig. 1(a) represents an elevational<br>
view of the novel arsenic removal plant according to the present<br>
invention. Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c) show respectively a plan view and a<br>
side view of the embodiment of Fig. 1(a) according to the invention, in<br>
which, a plurality of overhead water tank (1) is installed at a different<br>
height supported by framed structure (2). The upper tank (1) has a<br>
sheet cover (5) made of corrugated sheets. A plurality of basement<br>
(4) is provided for installation of each of the plurality of overhead<br>
water tank (1). A platform (11) constructed at the ground level and<br>
fixed to the ground with a plurality of foundation bolts and nuts (12). A<br>
lifting means (8,10) is installed on the platform at the ground level for<br>
extracting and lifting ground water contaminated with arsenic. For<br>
smaller-capacity plant, the lifting means can be selected as a<br>
tubewell (8) and for the higher-capacity plant, the lifting means can<br>
constitute of an electric motor with a pump (10).<br>
The raw water is lifted through a delivery pipe (6) to the upper tank for<br>
storage. An iron filter (3) containg gravel/sand/manganese dioxide is<br>
placed above the lower tank and raw water from said upper tank is<br>
passed through the iron filter (3). The filtered water then passed<br>
through an arsenic filter (7) arranged at an opposite side of the lower<br>
tank (1). The arsenic free filtered water is stored in the lower tank<br>
having a plurality of taps (9). The tubular network for multi-stage<br>
delivery of raw-water, semi-filtered water and filtered water has a<br>
plurality of flow-control valves and a water meter.<br>
Samples of water collected from different areas of the country have<br>
shown Arsenic concentration to a level of 2000 micrograms per liter.<br>
Concentration of 50 micrograms per liter is taken to be safe for<br>
human consumption according to Indian standard.<br>
The method being simple, economical and environment friendly can<br>
be used for removing Arsenic from ground water of the area where<br>
water is contaminated with Arsenic. The system is so efficient that it<br>
can bring down the Arsenic concentration to a level less then 0.01<br>
mg. or 10 microgram per liter.<br>
Moreover, spent adsorbent is utilized in the brickfield where 5% of<br>
Granular Ferric Hydroxide is normally required for the manufacture of<br>
bricks.<br>
The design of the Arsenic Removal Plant (ARP) includes all the<br>
parameters. The proposed ARP has been customized to meet the<br>
demand of the village people and to suit their needs. It has been<br>
designed in such a way as to be fitted to hand tubewells/electric<br>
motors. Widely varying raw water contaminated with Arsenic can be<br>
treated by the system. The operation of ARP is simple and users<br>
friendly.<br>
