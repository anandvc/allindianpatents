				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to improvements in the transfer of polymer slurry from one<br>
olefin polymerization loop reactor to another olefin polymerization loop reactor in a multiple<br>
loop reactor. More in particular, the present invention relates to a multiple loop reactor<br>
suitable for olefin polymerization comprising at least two interconnected loop reactors and to<br>
a olefin polymerization process wherein polymer slurry is substantially horizontally transferred<br>
from one loop reactor to another loop reactor through transfer lines.<br>
Background<br>
Olefin polymerizations such as ethylene polymerization are frequently carried out using<br>
monomer, diluent and catalyst and optionally co -monomers and hydrogen in a reactor. The<br>
polymerization is usually performed under slurry conditions, wherein the product consists<br>
usually of solid particles and is in suspension in a diluent The slurry contents of the reactor<br>
are circulated continuously with a pum p to maintain efficient suspension of the polymer solid<br>
particles in the liquid diluent. The product is discharged by means of settling legs, which<br>
operate on a batch principle to recover the product. Settling in the legs is used to increase the<br>
solids concentration of the slurry finally recovered as product slurry. The product is further<br>
discharged to a flash tank, through flash lines, where most of the diluent and unreacted<br>
monomers are flashed off and recycled. The polymer particles are dried, additives can be<br>
added and finally the polymer is extruded and pelletized.<br>
Multiple polyolefin reactors operating in series can be used for olefin polymerizations, as is<br>
known in the prior art. Certain polymerization processes comprise the use of two or several<br>
polymerization reactors, which are interconnected. A "bimodal olefin polymer" refers to an<br>
olefin polymer that is manufactured using two reactors, which are connected to each other in<br>
series. However, problems associated with known polymerization processes a nd apparatuses<br>
using a polymerization system having two or more serially disposed polymerization reactor<br>
vessels, include inaccurate inter-reactor transfer of polymer slurry between the serially<br>
disposed reactors, while maintaining each reactor at independ ently selected operating<br>
conditions. In certain cases, fewer fine particles (fines) are produced during transfer, which<br>
tend to hang-up or become trapped in transfer equipment and can even plug lines and<br><br>
valves. Frequent plugging causes system down time, I ost final product and raw materials, and<br>
increased operating costs.<br>
In the prior art systems, interconnected reactors have been described which are disposed in<br>
substantially vertical arrangements, i.e. reactors arranged in tandem vertical arrangement<br>
under an angle of inclination with respect to a horizontal axis extending from the exit of the<br>
first reactor which is more than 45°. Such arrangements require vertical product transfer lines<br>
or other vertical means for transferring polymer product from the pol ymerization zone of a first<br>
reactor to the polymerization zone of a second reactor. However, a problem associated with<br>
this type of configuration is that it requires the positioning of the reactors in a vertical<br>
arrangement, which is generally technically limited and results in increased fabrication costs.<br>
Also in such configurations the reactors are positioned close to one another, which limits their<br>
accessibility.<br>
US 3,3445,431 describes an apparatus for the co -polymerization of mono-1-olefins. The<br>
apparatus comprises two interconnected reactors. Transfer of polymer product from the first<br>
reactor to the second reactor is done by transfer of the polymer product into an auger<br>
conveyor which carries the polymer products from the first reactor to the wash co lumn of the<br>
second reactor. An auger conveyor is a conveyor that has a trough or a tube in which a<br>
product moves under the action of an endless screw or flights. Thus, for transfer of the<br>
polymer product from one reactor to the other reactor a mechanical, motor-driven, device is<br>
used in the apparatus described in US 3,3445,431.<br>
In view of the above, there remains a need in the art to provide a method and a<br>
polymerization reactor system in which operating problems experienced by prior art multi -<br>
reactor systems are reduced and in which the apparatus may be built and operated more<br>
economically than prior art systems.<br>
It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide multiple, interconnected<br>
reactors that are built and operated more econo mically than known prior art multiple reactors.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method for production of polyolefins<br>
in general, and polyethylene in particular, in multiple interconnected reactors. A further object<br>
of the present invention is to provide an improved method utilizing multiple, interconnected<br><br>
reactors, which reduces construction and operating costs, and improves operating<br>
performance and operating versatility of the reactor system.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention relat es in a first aspect to a reactor suitable for olefin polymerization<br>
comprising at least two interconnected reactors, whereby said connection essentially consists<br>
of one or more transfer lines suitable for transferring polymer slurry from a reactor to anot her<br>
reactor and whereby said transfer line extends substantially horizontally.<br>
According to the present invention at least two reactors are interconnected, and preferably<br>
connected in series, so that polymer product produced in one reactor can be transfer red to<br>
another polymerization reactor for further polymerization therein. In accordance with the<br>
present invention, the two reactors are disposed in a substantially same horizontal plane<br>
permitting direct substantially horizontal transfer of the polymer pr oduct from one to the other<br>
polymerization reactor. For this purpose, product transfer lines are provided for transferring<br>
polymer product from one reactor to another reactor that extend substantially horizontally.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the transfer line extends substantially horizontally from the exit of<br>
a settling leg of a reactor to the entry in another reactor. The transfer line thus connects the<br>
exit of a settling leg of a reactor with the entry of another reactor.<br>
In another preferred embodim ent, the transfer line extends substantially horizontally under an<br>
angle of inclination a with respect to a horizontal axis X -X' which is lower than 45°, and<br>
preferably lower than 40°, lower than 35°, lower than 30°, lower than 25°, lower than 20°, and<br>
more preferably lower than 15°. In a more preferred embodiment, the transfer line extends<br>
substantially horizontally under an angle of inclination a with respect to a horizontal axis X -X'<br>
which comprises 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, T, 8°, 9° or 10°.<br>
As used herein the term transfer lines extending "substantially horizontally" refers to the<br>
positioning of these lines with respect to a horizontal axis X -X', which differs from this axis X -<br>
X' with no more than 45°, and preferably with no more than 40°, preferabl y with no more than<br>
35°, preferably with no more than 30°, preferably with no more than 25°, preferably with no<br>
more than 20°, more preferably with no more than 15°, and most preferably which differs from<br>
this axis X-X' with 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9° or 10°.<br><br>
The term a "substantially horizontal plane", as used herein refers to a plane that can be<br>
inclined with respect to a horizontal plane with no more than 45°, and preferably with no more<br>
than 40", preferably with no more than 35°, preferab ly with no more than 30°, preferably with<br>
no more than 25°, preferably with no more than 20°, more preferably with no more than 15°,<br>
and most preferably comprising 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9" or 10°.<br>
The term "substantially horizontal transfer" refers to the transfer of polymer slurry from one<br>
reactor to another whereby the transfer is performed by means of a line which has an angle<br>
of inclination with respect to a horizontal axis X -X' which is lower than 45°, preferably lower<br>
than 40°, preferably lower than 35°, preferably lower than 30°, preferably lower than 25°,<br>
preferably lower than 20°, more preferably lower than 15", and most preferably which<br>
comprises 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9° or 10°.<br>
The "angle of inclination' as used herei n is defined as the angle made by the transfer line with<br>
respect to a horizontal axis X-X'. This angle of inclination is according to the invention lower<br>
than 45°, preferably lower than 40°, preferably lower than 35°, preferably lower than 30°,<br>
preferably lower than 25°, preferably lower than 20°, more preferably lower than 15°, and<br>
most preferably comprises 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9° or 10°.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for producing olefin polymers in<br>
a reactor, wherein said reactor consists of at least two interconnected" reactors, whereby said<br>
connection essentially consists of one or more transfer lines suitable for transferring polymer<br>
slurry from a reactor to another reactor, comprising the steps of<br>
-	introducing into a reactor one or more olefin reactants, polymerization catalysts and<br>
diluents,<br>
-	polymerizing said one or more olefin reactants to produce polymer slurry,<br>
-	pumping said polymer slurry for maintaining the circulation in said reactor,<br>
said process further comprising one or more cycles of:<br>
-	allowing said polymer slurry to settle in one or more settling legs connected to said<br>
reactor, and<br><br>
- substantially horizontally transferring said polymer slurry from said settling legs to<br>
another reactor through said one or more transfer lines.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the polymer slurry is transferred substantially horizontally through<br>
said transfer line from the exit of a settling leg of a reactor to the entry in the other reactor<br>
through a transfer line un der an angle of inclination a with respect to a horizontal axis X -X'<br>
which is lower than 45° and which most preferably comprises 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, 7°, 8°,<br>
9° or 10°.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of a transfer line for transferring polymer<br>
slurry from a reactor to another reactor in a reactor comprising at least two interconnected<br>
reactors, whereby said transfer line extends substantially horizontally.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention relates to the use of a transfer I ine which extends<br>
substantially horizontally from the exit of a settling leg of a reactor to the entry in the other<br>
reactor under an angle of inclination a with respect to a horizontal axis X -X' which is lower<br>
than 45° and which preferably comprises 0°, 1 •, 2°, 3°, 4°, 5°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9° or 10°.<br>
The reactor and process according to the present invention present several advantages over<br>
the prior art, such as allowing optimized transfer of a settled slurry from settling legs from one<br>
to another reactor in a cost-effective way.<br>
By providing transfer lines which extend substantially horizontally between the interconnected<br>
reactor, two reactors can be positioned in a substantially same horizontal plane, which has<br>
the advantage that the installation of the rea ctors is easier: the reactors can be positioned at<br>
a greater distance from one another than is the case for vertically aligned reactors. In<br>
addition, horizontal alignment of the reactors permits to reduce construction and operating<br>
costs and improves the accessibility of each individual reactor, which is important from<br>
technical and safety point of view.<br>
Surprisingly, it was shown that substantially horizontal transfer of polymer product from one to<br>
another reactor by means of the transfer lines does not increase the frequency of plugging in<br>
the polymer transfer lines but provides optimal product transfer in a cost -effective way.<br><br>
The present invention will be further disclosed in detail hereunder. The description is only<br>
given by way of example and does not limit the invention. The reference numbers relate to<br>

Detailed descrip tion of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a process which provide a substantially<br>
horizontally transfer of polymer slurry from one to the other reactor in a multiple reactor<br>
system.<br>
The following detailed description has bee n focused on a multiple loop reactor, consisting of<br>
at least two loop reactors which are interconnected in series. However, the present invention<br>
is not restricted to loop reactors but is also suitable for any other type of multiple reactor,<br>
consisting of at least two reactors which are connected in series.<br>
The present invention is suitable for polymerization processes occurring in loop reactors for<br>
the production of olefin polymers consisting of the catalytic polymerization of olefins such as<br>
C2 to C8 olefins in a diluent containing the monomer to be polymerized. Examples of suitable<br>
monomers include but are not limited to those having 2 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule, such<br>
as ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentene, butadiene, isoprene , 1-hexene and the like.<br>
The polymerization reaction can be carried out at a temperature of from 50 to 120 °C,<br>
preferably at temperature of from 70 to 115 °C, more preferably at temperature of from 80 to<br>
110 °C, and at a pressure of from 20 to 100 bars, preferably at pressur e of from 30 to 50<br>
bars, more preferably at pressure of 37 to 45 bars.<br>
The present invention has in particular been described in terms of the polymerization of<br>
ethylene. Suitable 'ethylene polymerization" includes but is not limited to homo -<br><br>
polymerization of ethylene, co-polymerization of ethylene and a higher 1 -olefin co-monomer<br>
such as butene, 1 -pentene, 1 -hexene, 1 -octene or 1 -decene. More in particular, the present<br>
invention is described in terms of the polymerization of ethylene for manufacturing bimo dal<br>
polyethylene (PE). "Bimodal PE" refers to PE that is manufactured using two reactors, which<br>
are connected to each other in series.<br>
Ethylene polymerizes in a liquid diluent in the presence of a catalyst, optionally a co -catalyst,<br>
optionally a co-monomer, optionally hydrogen and optionally other additives, thereby<br>
producing polymerization sluny.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymerization slurry" or "polymer slurry" or "slurry" means<br>
substantially a multi -phase composition including at least polymer solid s and a liquid phase<br>
and allows for a third phase (gas) to be at least locally present in the process, the liquid<br>
phase being the continuous phase. The solids include catalyst and a polymerized olefin, such<br>
as polyethylene. The liquids include an inert dil uent, such as isobutane, dissolved monomer<br>
such as ethylene, co-monomer, molecular weight control agents, such as hydrogen, antistatic<br>
agents, antifouling agents, scavengers, and other process additives.<br>
Suitable diluents are well known in the art and inc lude hydrocarbons that are inert or at least<br>
essentially inert and liquid under reaction conditions. Suitable hydrocarbons include<br>
isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, i-pentane, neopentane, isohexane and n -hexane,<br>
with isobutane being preferred.<br>
Suitable catalysts are well known in the art. Examples of suitable catalysts include but are not<br>
limited to chromium oxide such as those supported on silica or aluminium, organometal<br>
catalysts including those known in the art as "Ziegler" or "Ziegler -Natta" catalysts,<br>
metallocene catalysts and the like. The term "co -catalyst* as used herein refers to materials<br>
that can be used in conjunction with a catalyst in order to improve the activity of the catalyst<br>
during the polymerization reaction.<br>
In a first embodime nt, the present invention relates to a multiple loop reactor suitable for<br>
olefin polymerization comprising at least two interconnected loop reactors whereby said<br>
connection essentially consists of one or more transfer lines suitable for transferring polyme r<br>
slurry from a reactor to another reactor and whereby said transfer line extends substantially<br><br>
horizontally. Referring now to FIG. 1, a multiple loop reactor 1 is illustrated comprising at least<br>
two polymerization reactors 2, 3, which are interconnected i n series in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Although, in a preferred embodiment, the invention comprises the use of<br>
two separate loop reactors, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention<br>
also may be practiced using more th an two separate reactors.<br>
The two reactors 2, 3 may be operated in series to produce, simultaneously, the same or two<br>
different polyolefin products, depending upon the polyolefin feed stock and catalyst provided<br>
and the temperature, pressure and other con ditions maintained inside the reactors. In the<br>
preferred embodiment of the apparatus and method of present invention, the reactors are<br>
operated in series so that polymer product produced in one reactor is transferred to another<br>
reactor for further polymeri zation therein.<br>
The final polyolefin product produced by the multiple loop reactor is dependent upon a wide<br>
range of variables which may be separately adjusted in at least two loop reactor systems,<br>
including compositions of the fluidizing mediums in each loop reactor, the polymerization<br>
catalysts, the temperatures, pressures, flow rates and other factors maintained in the different<br>
reactor. Thus, polymerization system of the present invention using the present multiple loop<br>
reactor 1 has the operating fie xibility to produce a broad.spectrum of polyolefin polymers with<br>
varying physical properties. In a preferred embodiment, loop reactors of the multiple loop<br>
reactor system are used in series to produce a sequentially polymerized product containing<br>
specific characteristics.<br>
As illustrated on Fig. 1, the multiple loop reactor comprises at least two interconnected loop<br>
reactors 2,3, each consisting of a plurality of interconnected pipes 4 defining a flow path 8 for<br>
a polymer slurry. In addition, one or more se ttling legs 12 connected to the pipes 4 of one<br>
reactor 2, are provided. Each of these settling legs 12 is provided with a transfer line 16 for<br>
transferring polymer slurry to another reactor 3. One or more settling legs 12 are also<br>
connected to the pipes 4 of the other reactor 3 for discharging polymer slurry from the reactor<br>
3 into a product recovery zone. Furthermore, a t least one pump 6 suitable for maintaining the<br>
polymer slurry in circulation in said multiple loop reactor is provided. The connection of the<br>
loop reactors 2, 3 essentially consists of one or more transfer lines 16 and whereby said<br>
transfer line extends substantially horizontally from one reactor 2 to the other reactor 3. In<br><br>
particular, the transfer line extends substantially horizontally under an angle of inclination a,<br>
with respect to a horizontal axis X -X' which is lower than 45°.<br>
Each loop reactor 2, 3 consists of a plurality of interconnected pipes 4, such as a plurality of<br>
vertical pipe segments, a plurality of upper lateral pipe segme nts, a plurality of lower lateral<br>
pipe segments, wherein each of said vertical pipe segment is connected at an upper end<br>
thereof to one of said upper lateral pipe segment and is connected at a lower end thereof to<br>
one of said lower lateral pipe segments th rough elbow shaped connecting segments, thus,<br>
defining a continuous flow path 8 for a polymer slurry. It will be understood that while the loop<br>
reactor 2 and 3 are illustrated with four vertical pipes, said loop reactors 2,3 may be equipped<br>
with less or mo re pipes, such as 4 or more pipes, for example between 4 and 20 vertical<br>
pipes. The vertical sections of the pipe segments are preferably provided with heat jackets<br>
10. Polymerization heat can be extracted by means of cooling water circulating in these<br>
jackets of the reactor. Said reactors preferably operate in a liquid full mode.<br>
The reactants including monomer ethylene, a light hydrocarbon diluent and optionally a co -<br>
monomer and hydrogen are introduced into the reactor 2 by line 5. At least one reactor 2 is<br>
also fed with catalyst, optionally in conjunction with a co -catalyst or activation agent, by<br>
means of the conduct 11.<br>
The polymerization slurry is maintained in circulation in the loop reactors. The polymerization<br>
slurry is directionally circulated throughout the loop reactor 2, 3 as illustrated by the arrows 8<br>
by one or more pumps, such as axial flow pump 6. The pump may be powered by an electric<br>
motor 7. As used herein the term "pump" includes any device from compressing driving,<br>
raising the pressure of a fluid, by means for example of a piston or set of rotating impellers 9.<br>
According to the present invention, the pump is preferably of axial type.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, catalysts are introduced upstream from the circulation pump 6 via<br>
line 5, while diluent, monomer, potential co -monomers and reaction additives are preferably<br>
introduced downstream of the circulation pump 6 via line 11.<br>
Each loop reactor 2, 3 is further provided with one or more settling legs 12 connected to the<br>
pipes 4 of the reactor 2, 3. Intermediate po lymer slurry or polymer product may be removed<br>
from the loop reactors, by continuous or periodical discharge through one or more settling<br><br>
legs 10 along with some diluent. In the settling legs 12, the solid content is increased with<br>
respect to its concentration in the body of the loop reactor. As illustrated in Figure 1, polymer<br>
slurry settled in the settling legs 12 may be removed by means of a three -way valve 15, either<br>
to another reactor 3, to which it is transferred by means of a transfer line 16, or to the product<br>
recovery zone, for instance by means of a conduit 20.<br>
The settling legs can be located on any segment or any elbow of said loop reactor, in said<br>
settling legs the polymerization slurry decants so that the slurry exiting the reactor is more<br>
concentrated in solid than the circulating slurry. This permits to limit the quantity of diluent<br>
that has to be treated and re -fed to the reactor. It will be understood that the discharge of said<br>
settling legs may be operated in a continuous or discontinuous mode.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, one of the horizontal sections of each reactor 2, 3 is provided with<br>
four settling legs 12. Although only four settling legs are illustrated in Figure 1, the present<br>
invention encompasses lo op reactors comprising one or more settling legs. In an embodiment<br>
of the present invention said loop reactor comprises 2 to 20 settling legs, preferably 4 to 12<br>
settling legs, more preferably 6 to 10 settling legs.<br>
The settling legs 12 are preferably pr ovided with an isolation valve 13. These valves 13 may<br>
for example be ball valves. Under normal conditions these valves are open. These valves can<br>
be closed for example to isolate a settling leg from operation. Said valves 13 can be closed<br>
when the reactor pressure falls below a chosen value.<br>
Further the settling legs can be provided with product take off or discharge valves 14.<br>
Discharging is performed in such a way that the volume discharged from a settling leg<br>
substantially corresponds to the volume of polymer slurry settled in said settling leg since its<br>
previous discharge. The discharge valve 14 may be any type of valve, which can permit<br>
continuous or periodical discharge of polymer slurry, when it is fully open. An angle valve, or<br>
ball valve may be s uitably used. For example, the valve may have such a structure that solid<br>
matter is prevented from accumulating or precipitating at the main body portion of the valve.<br>
However, the type and structure of the discharge valve can be selected by those skilled in the<br>
art as required. According an embodiment of the present invention the totality of settled slurry<br>
is discharged at each opening of the discharge valve. When a plurality of legs are employed,<br><br>
the discharge of the settled polymer slurry may be discharg ed in sequence on a rotating basis<br>
for more uniform discharging to a subsequent reactor or to a product recovery zone.<br>
Downstream the valve 14, at the exit of the settling leg 12, a three -way valve 15 is provided<br>
which allows to transfer polymer slurry se ttled in the settling legs, either to a product recovery<br>
zone, or to another reactor, by means of the transfer line 16.<br>
Each settling leg 10 provided on one reactor 2, which is connected in series with another<br>
reactor 3, may be provided with a transfer li ne 16 for transfer of (intermediate) polymer slurry<br>
settled in the settling leg 12 to the other loop reactor 3. Settling legs 12 can also be<br>
connected to the pipes of the other loop reactor 3 for discharging settled polymer slurry into a<br>
product recovery zone, e.g. by means of conduits 19. As used herein "product recovery<br>
zone" includes but is not limited to heated or not heated flash lines, flash tank, cyclones,<br>
filters and the associated vapor recovery and solids recovery systems or transfer lines to a<br>
following reactor and said following reactor when several reactors are connected in series.<br>
The two loop reactors 2, 3 represented in Figure 1 are connected in series by means of<br>
transfer lines 16. These transfer lines comprise generally cylindrical, inter mediate product<br>
transfer lines and extend substantially horizontally from the exit of a settling leg of a reactor to<br>
the entry in the other reactor. In particular, the transfer line connects the three -way valve 15,<br>
provided at the exit of the settling leg 12 of one reactor 2, with the entry in the other reactor 3,<br>
where a piston valve 18 is provided.<br>
Fig. 2 is a detailed illustration of the connection of two loop reactors by means of a transfer<br>
line 16. As illustrated in Figure 2, the transfer line extend s substantially horizontally under an<br>
inclination angle a with respect to a horizontal axis X-X'. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
angle a is lower than 45°, preferably lower than 40°, lower than 35°, lower than 30°, lower<br>
than 25°, lower than 20°, lower tha n 15° and most preferably corresponds to 0°, 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°,<br>
5°, 6°, 7°, 8°, 9° or 10°.<br>
In another embodiment, the tangent of angle a can also be defined as AH/AL, whereby AL is<br>
the horizontal distance between the exit of a settling leg of a reactor and the entry in another<br>
reactor, and whereby AH is the perpendicular distance between the exit of a settling leg of a<br>
reactor, in particular the three -way valve 15, and the entry in another reactor, in particular at<br><br>
the piston valve 18. In a preferred embodim ent, the perpendicular distance AH between the<br>
exit of a settling leg of a reactor and the entry in another reactor is smaller than the horizontal<br>
distance AL between the exit of a settling leg of a reactor and the entry in another reactor.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the transfer line 16 can be further provided with one or<br>
more means for controlling temperature, flow or pressure of the polymer slurry in said line.<br>
The means for controlling temperature may for instance comprise a jacket. In addition, diluent<br>
flushing means 17 can be provided preferably at the inlet of the transfer line 16. Isobutane<br>
flushing means 17 enable to flush isobutane through the transfer line 17 and to keep the line<br>
unplugged. This is important when the settling leg is put ou t of service. One of the<br>
advantages of such flush is that a settling leg 12 can be can put back in service after it was<br>
taken out of service.<br>
In another embodiment, the transfer line 16 for transferring polymer slurry from one to<br>
another loop reactor is equipped by one or more valves, preferably piston valves 18 at the<br>
outlet of the transfer line. The piston valves 18 are capable of sealing the orifice by which the<br>
transfer line 16 is connected to the loop reactor 3.<br>
It is believed that positioning of lo op reactors in a multiple loop reactor system in a<br>
substantially Horizontal plane and the use of the substantially horizontal intermediate product<br>
transfer lines enables to improve operating characteristics for the system by facilitating the<br>
installation of the reactors and by enabling the reactors to be installed at larger distances than<br>
is the case when using vertically arranged reactors.<br>
Further, such substantially horizontal configuration allows easiness of locating the lines so<br>
that they are straight. Obstruction in the transfer line, including curves or any other deviations<br>
from a substantially horizontal orientation, and any unnecessary extension of the transfer line,<br>
may decrease the rate of transfer between the loop reactors and increases the freq uency of<br>
plugging in the transfer line.<br>
The polymerization system of the present invention minimizes the opportunity for plugging in<br>
the transfer lines by eliminating sites where the polyolefin polymer can begin to accumulate.<br>
Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the transfer line is substantially horizontal in orientation<br><br>
and free of any bends or other obstruction. If desired, additional means may be provided in<br>
the product transfer line for aiding the flow of polymer product between the loop reactors, e.g.<br>
vibration hammers.<br>
As a further safety measure in the event of polymer plugs or obstructions developing in the<br>
transfer line during operation, more than one product transfer lines is provided between the<br>
polymerization loop reactors.<br>
In the event that the horizontal transfer line becomes plugged or obstructed for any reason, or<br>
if a product flow rate beyond the capacity of the transfer line is desired, then polymer slurry<br>
can be withdrawn from one reactor through another transfer line and supplied to an other<br>
polymerization reactor to permit continued operation of the system. The reactors are still<br>
working while transfer lines are out of operation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, more than one product transfer line is not only used from safety<br>
point of view, but also from productivity point of view. More than one product transfer line may<br>
be used so that the use of settling legs is maximized and the transfer of diluent from the first<br>
reactor to the second reactor is minimized. In another embodiment, some trans fer lines can<br>
be put out of service, e.g. when polymerization is performed at reduced rates and for the<br>
start-up.<br>
Preferably, the transfer lines for transferring polymer slurry from one to another reactor, are<br>
continuously flushed, e.g. with isobutane, i n operation or not.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, by operation in accordance with the present invention, all<br>
lines, vessels, pumps, valves, etc.. can be kept free of clogging by means of flushing or<br>
purging with nitrogen or diluent, i.e. isobutane. It is to be understood that where necessary<br>
flushing and purging means and lines are available on the device according to the invention<br>
in order to avoid plugging, or blocking. This is useful for example when the reactor is to be<br>
completely emptied in order to make an intervention on the reactor.<br>
It is clear from the present description that numbers and dimensions of the different parts of<br>
the reactor relate to the size of the polymerization reactors and can be changed in function of<br>
the reactor sizes.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that all lines or conduits applied in<br>
accordance with the present invention may be provided, where necessary with flow<br>
measuring means.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention can be applied on a double loop reactor, as<br>
depicted on FIG. 3. FIG. 3 represents two single loop reactors 100, 116, which are<br>
interconnected in series. Both reactors 100,116 consist of a plurality of interconnected pipes<br>
104.	The vertical sections of the pipe segments 10 4 are preferably provided with heat jackets<br>
105.	Reactants are introduced into the reactors 100 by line 107. Catalyst, optionally in<br>
conjunction with a co-catalyst or activation agent, is injected in the reactor 100 or 116 by<br>
means of the conduct 106. The polymerization slurry is directionally circulated throughout the<br>
loop reactors 100,116 as illustrated by the arrows 108 by one or more pumps, such as axial<br>
flow pump 101. The pumps may be powered by an electric motor 102. The pumps may be<br>
provided with set of rotating impellers 103. The reactors 100, 116 are further provided with<br>
one or more settling legs 109 connected to the pipes 104 of the reactors 100, 116. The<br>
settling legs 109 are preferably provided with an isolation valve 110. Further the settling legs<br>
can be provided with product take off or discharge valves 111 or can be in direct<br>
communication with the downstream section. Downstream the valve 111 at the exit of the<br>
settling leg 109 of reactor 100, a transfer line 112 is provided which allows to t ransfer polymer<br>
slurry settled in the settling legs 109 to the other reactor 116 preferably through a piston valve<br>
115. Polymer slurry settled in the settling legs 109 of reactor 116 can be removed by means<br>
of one or more product recovery lines 113, e.g. t o a product recovery zone.<br>
