				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a water purification filter which can be easily replaced by a connector which does not require an operation of locking a feed water locking valve by automatically closing a passage by an auto shut off valve, when a filter cartridge of a water purification system using a reverse osmosis membrane filter is disconnected for replacement, and a water purification system using the same, and more particularly, to a water purification filter which can simplify a connection structure of a water purification system by forming paths of feed water, purified water(product water) and concentrated water as one port, and which can be easily replaced by a connector for disconnecting a filter cartridge from the water purification system and replacing an internal filter, and a water purification system using the same.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic structure diagram illustrating a conventional water purification system using a reverse osmosis membrane filter.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional water purification system includes a sediment filter 1 for removing, by a nonwoven fabric, macro-sized alien substances such as solid matters floating in rust, soil and sand from feed water (for example, underground water) flowing in<br>
1A<br><br>
through a hose connected to a tap (not shown), a precarbon filter 2 for removing chlorine elements and organic chemical substances remaining in water by an adsorption method of an activated charcoal made by burning mineral matters of coal or a palm tree at a high temperature, a reverse osmosis membrane filter 3 for removing various contaminants, germs, inorganic substances and heavy metal from water through 0.0001 microns of minute pores by a polyamide composite film, and a postcarbon filter 4 for improving water taste by removing smells and gas elements from water.<br>
Here, the impurities (concentrated water) filtered by the reverse osmosis membrane filter 3 arc externally discharged through a concentrated water control valve 5.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the conventional reverse osmosis membrane filter includes a cap 7, an inflow hole 6 through which feed water flows in being protruded from one end of the cap 7, a filter housing 10 which the reverse osmosis membrane filter 3 for filtering various alien substances of feed water is installed in and which a purified water discharge hole 8 and a concentrated water discharge hole 9 are separately formed on, and a core-shaped tube 12 installed at the center of the reverse osmosis membrane filter 3 in the length direction, for collecting purified water filtered by the reverse osmosis membrane filter 3 through a through hole 11, and sending the collected water to the purified water discharge hole 8.<br>
Reference numeral 13 denotes a sealing member for preventing feed water and concentrated water from being mixed by intercepting leakage of feed water from the reverse 20 osmosis membrane filter 3 by taping.<br>
2<br><br>
As described above, since the purified water discharge hole 8 and the concentrated water discharge hole 9 are separately formed on the reverse osmosis membrane filter 3, the prime cost of production increases. In addition, special components such as a hose and a connection member are required to connect the filters of the water purification system. It is thus difficult to install and assemble the water purification system in a narrow space. General consumers who do not have knowledge or experience in filter replacement cannot easily replace the filters, and thus must stand the after/sale service expense.<br>
Furthermore, when one filter cartridge is replaced in the water purification system having the plurality of filter cartridges, a passage is closed by switching a feed water locking device into a lock state, the filter cartridge is replaced, and the feed water locking device is switched into an unlock state. As a result, operational efficiency is reduced.<br>

As shown in FIG. 3, when the filter housing 57 having the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 is inserted and connected to the connector 55 in the up direction (seen from the drawing), the feed v/ater flowing path 50A is opened by upwardly pressurizing the auto shut off valve 51 by the passage switching guide 63 (here, the elastic member 58 is compressed).<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 7, when the filter housing 57 is inserted into the connector 55 in the unlock position (left direction in the drawing) by moving the lever 71 coupled to the lower cover 66, the cam-shaped filter support members 69 are rotated on the central axes of the fixing pins 67 mounted on the positioning grooves 65 of the lower cover 66 and transferred into the positioning grooves 65 (refer to FIG. 5(a)). Therefore, the filter housing 57 can be inserted and connected<br>
18<br><br>
to the connector 55.<br>
Here, the auto shut off valve 51 is upwardly lifted by the passage switching guide 63 coupled to the cap 82 of the filter housing 57, thereby opening the feed water flowing path 50A. Accordingly, the feed water supplied from an external source flows in the feed water flowing path 50A through the inflow hole 50, passes through the passage switching guide 63, and flows in the filter housing 57 through the path 74 (as indicated by the arrow directions of FIG. 3).<br>
In the lock position by moving the lever 71, the coupling protrusions 70 of the lever 71 are slidably moved in the coupling grooves 68 of the filter support members 69 on the central axis of the through hole 64 of the lower cover 66, and thus the filter support members 69 are rotated on the central axes of the fixing pins 67 from the positioning grooves 65 of the lower cover 66 to the center through hole 64 (refer to FIG. 5(b)). The filter support members 69 are prevented from being excessively rotated by the stoppers 72 protruded from the positioning grooves 65.<br>
Therefore, the collar 82a formed at the neck unit of the filter housing cap 82 is supported by the filter support members 69, thereby preventing the filter housing 57 from being disconnected from the connector 55.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIGS. 3, 8 and 9, the feed water passing through the inflow hole 50 of the connector 55 and the first path 60 of the passage switching guide 63 and flowing to the lower portion of the filter housing 57 along the path 74 is inwardly supplied through the bottom surface of the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 installed in the filter<br>
19<br><br>
housing 57. Here, the end processing member 75 for sealing the ring-shaped extended strip end 73 extended from the passage switching guide 63 prevents mixing of feed water flowing in the filter housing 57 and concentrated water discharged from the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56.<br>
As a result, the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 filters various impurities of feed water, and the purified water is collected in the core type tube 59 installed at the center of the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56, and transferred in the up direction (seen from the drawing).<br>
The water purified by the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 passes through the tube 59 and the second path 61 of the passage switching guide 63, and is externally discharged through the outflow hole 52 formed on the connector 55 (refer to FIGS. 3 and 8(b)). The concentrated water containing impurities filtered by the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 sequentially passes through the third path 62 of the passage switching guide 63, the concentrated water discharge path 53 formed on the check valve body 54, and the concentrated water discharge hole 76 installed in the connector 55, and is discharged to the external designated space through the concentrated water discharge tube 83 (refer to FIGS. 3 and 11).<br>
On the other hand, referring to FIGS. 3 and 14, the concentrated water discharged from the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 passes through the third path 62 formed in the passage switching guide 63, the concentrated water discharge path 53 formed in the check valve body 54 installed in the connector 55 to be linked to the third path 62, the through hole 77 formed on the body 78 of the concentrated water control hole 76 to be linked to the concentrated water<br>
20<br><br>
discharge path 53, the rotary strip 79 linked to the through hole 77, the variable width slit 79a formed on the cylindrical wall of the rotary strip 79, and the groove 78a formed on the inner circumference of the body 78 in the axial direction, and is externally discharged through the concentrated water discharge tube 83.<br>
Controlled is the discharge amount of concentrated water passing through the through hole 77 formed on the body 78 in the radial direction and flowing in the body 78 and the rotary strip 79 rotatably coupled to the body 78. That is, the opening degree crossing the groove 78a formed on the inner circumference of the body 78 in the up/down direction is determined by rotating the rotary strip 79 having the variable width conical slit 79a on the body 78, thereby controlling the discharge amount of concentrated water.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3, 8(c) and 10, the purified water discharged from the reverse osmosis members filter 56 is externally discharged through the tube 59, the second path 61 formed in the passage guide 63 to be linked to the tube 59, and the outflow hole 52 of the connector 55.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 4 to 7, when the filter housing 57 needs to be disconnected from the connector 55 to replace the reverse osmosis membrane filter 56, the coupling protrusions 70 protruded from the lever 71 slidably move in the coupling grooves 68 of the filter support members 69 by switching the lever 71 into the unlock position. Therefore, the filter support members 69 are rotated on the central axes of the fixing pins 67, and transferred into the positioning grooves 65 of the lower cover 66 (refer to FIG. 5(a)).<br>
21<br><br>
Accordingly, the lock state of the filter support members 69 is released from the collar 82 of the filter housing cap 82, so that the filter housing 57 can be easily disconnected from the connector 55.<br>
FIG. 12 is an exemplary diagram illustrating a modified example of the water purification filter easily replaced by the connector in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>

The structure of the modified filter is identical to that of the above-described filter except for the water purification filter 81 that is one of the sediment filter, the activated charcoal filter and the hollow fiber filter installed in the filter housing 57, and the connector 55 having the inflow hole 50 through which feed water flows in, the feed water flowing path 50A, and the outflow ho!e 52 for externally discharging purified water, and thus detailed explanations thereof are omitted. Same reference numerals are used for same elements in different drawings.<br>
When the filter housing 57 is connected to the connector 55, the feed water flowing path 50A of the connector 55 is opened by upwardly lifting the auto shut off valve 51. The feed water supplied from an external source flows in the feed water flowing path 50A through the inflow hole 50, passes through the first path 60 formed in the passage switching guide 63 and the path 74, and flows in the filter housing 57.<br>
The feed water flowing in the filter housing 57 flows in the water purification filter 81 that is one of the sediment filter, the activated charcoal filter and the hollow fiber filter installed in the filter housing 57 in the radial direction (as indicated by the arrow directions). The water purified by the water purification filter 81 is collected at the center of the water purification filter 81, upwardly transferred through the through hole 81a, and externally discharged through the second path 61 of the passage switching guide 62 and the outflow hole 52 of the connector 55 linked to the second path 61.<br>
That is, the feed water flowing in the feed water flowing path 50A of the connector 55<br>
23<br><br>
through the inflow hole 50 flows in the filter housing 57 through the first path 60 of the passage switching guide 63, and is purified by the water purification filter 81. The purified water is discharged to the outflow hole 52 through the second path 61 of the passage switching guide 63.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 15, the concentrated water discharge hole 76 mounted on the connector 55 can be mounted on the side of the connector 55. Here, the structure of FIG. 15 is substantially identical to that of FIG. 3 except for the structure of discharging concentrated water in the side direction of the connector 55 through the discharge path 53 formed in the check valve body 54 installed in the connector 55, and thus detailed explanations thereof are omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, the water purification system includes a first connector A having an inflow hole 50a through which external feed water flows in, a check valve body 54 for housing a check valve 52 elastioally installed to open/close a feed water flowing path 50A for guiding feed water the inflow hole 50a to a filter side, and an outflow hole 52a for externally discharging purified water, and a first filter housing B for housing a sediment filter 84 for removing various alien substances such as rust, soil and sand from feed water by a nonwoven fabric, and opening the feed water flowing path 50A by opening the auto shut off valve 51 in detachable connection with the first connector A.<br>
In addition, the water purification system includes a second connector C having its inflow hole 50b connected in series to the outflow hole 52a of the first connector A, and including a check valve body 54 for housing an auto shut off valve 51 elastically installed to open/close a feed water flowing path 50A for guiding feed water from the inflow hole 50b to a filter side, and<br>
24<br><br>
an outflow hole 52b for externally discharging purified water, and a second filter housing D for housing a precarbon filter 85 for removing organic chemical substances such as residual chloride by an activated charcoal, and opening the feed water flowing path 50A by opening the auto shut off valve 51 in detachable connection with the second connector C.<br>
The water purification system also includes a third connector E having its inflow hole 50d connected in series to the outflow hole 52b of the second connector C, and including a check valve body 54 in which an auto shut off valve 51 elastically installed to open/close a feed water flowing path 50A for guiding feed water from the inflow hole 50d to a filter side and a concentrated water discharge path 53 for externally discharging concentrated water are formed, and a third filter housing F for housing a reverse osmosis membrane filter 56 for removing germs and mineral by minute pores, and opening the feed water flowing path 50A by opening the auto shut off valve 51 in detachable connection with the third connector E.<br>
Furthermore, the water purification system includes a fourth connector G having its inflow hole 50c connected in series to the outflow hole 52d of the third connector E, and including a check valve body 54 for housing an auto shut off valve 51 elastically installed to open/close a feed water flowing path 50A, and an outflow hole 52c for externally discharging purified water, and a fourth filter housing H for housing a postcarbon filter 86 for improving water taste by removing smells by an activated charcoal, and opening the feed water flowing path 50A by opening the auto shut off valve 51 in detachable connection with the fourth connector G.<br>
In addition, the water purification system includes locking means installed in the first to<br>
25<br><br>
fourth connectors A, C, E and G, for detachably fixing the first to fourth filter housings B, D, F and H to the first to fourth connectors A, C, E and G, respectively.<br>
A check valve 100 for preventing a counterflow is installed in a connection member 200 for connecting adjacent connectors in series to be linked to each other.<br>
	In the case that any one of the first to fourth filter housings B, D, F and H connected<br>
respectively to the first to fourth connectors A, C, E and G is disconnected from the corresponding connector, the corresponding inflow hole 50a, 50b, 50c or 50d is blocked by the returning operation of the auto shut off valves 51 coupled respectively to the first to fourth connectors A, C, E and G by the restoring force of the elastic member 58.<br>
	The check valve 100 for preventing the counterflow in the connection member 200 for<br>
connecting the adjacent connectors in series prevents a counterflow by a residual pressure of the lower connector or filter housing. Therefore, when any one of the first to fourth filter housings B, D, F and H is replaced, it is not necessary to switch the feed water locking valve into a lock state to prevent leakage of feed water.<br>
There is further provided a flushing valve 400 which is installed so as to open and close an inlet 400A and an outlet 400B communicating with a passage between the second connector C and the third connector E and which is basically directed to discharging foreign substances from the inside to the outside through the outlet 400C which is opened when the precarbon filter 85 formed of activated charcoal is first exchanged.<br>
The flushing valve 400 is preferably formed of a solenoid valve, which is opened or<br>
26<br><br>
closed as an electric signal is externally applied, or a mechanical valve, which is manually opened and closed.<br>
There is further provided a solenoid valve 500 which is installed so as to open or close an inlet 500A and an outlet 500B communicating with a passage between the first connector A and the second connector C and which is designed to disconnect the inlet and outlet 500A and 500B as an electric signal is externally inputted when the purified water stored in a storing tank(not shown) through the fourth filter housing H exceeds a set level.<br>
Here, the installation position of the solenoid valve 500 is not limited to the passage between the first connector A and the second connector C. For example, the passage may be formed between the third connector E and the fourth connector G.<br>
On the other hand, as illustrated in FIGS. 16 and 17, the locking means for detachably connecting the filter housing to the connector includes a lever 71a coupled between the lower cover 66 and the connector 55 to be swung, for detachably locking the filter housing 57 to the connector 55 by rotating the filter support members 69 by rotation by the user, a stopper 301 fixed on the bottom surface of the connector 55 by an elastic member 300, a locking groove 71c formed on the lever 71a in the up/down direction to face the stopper 301, a through hole 71b formed on the lever 71a in the radial direction to be linked to the locking groove 71c, and an unlocking hole 307 for unlocking the lever 71a from the connector 55 by separating the stopper 301 from the locking groove 71c when inserted into the through hole 71b.<br>
The structure of FIGS. 16 and 17 is substantially identical to that of FIG. 3, except for the<br>
27<br><br>
stopper 301 formed on the bottom surface of the connector 55, the locking groove 71c coupled to the stopper 301 for locking the lever 71a, and the unlocking hole 307 inserted into the locking groove 71c for unlocking the stopper 301, and thus detailed explanations thereof are omitted. Same reference numerals are used for same elements in different drawings.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 17, the water purification filter easily replaced by the connector includes a double-tube type connection tube 303 installed on the outflow hole 52 of the connector 55. for externally discharging purified water passing through the second path 61 through a purified water path 302 formed at the center in the length direction to be linked to the second path 61, and externally discharging concentrated water passing through the third path 62 through a concentrated water path 304 formed outside the purified water path 302 to be linked to the third path 62, and a concentrated water discharge tube 306 branch-connected to the rear portion of the connection tube 303 in the right angle direction, for externally discharging concentrated water in cooperation with the discharge hole 305 communicating with the concentrated water path 304 of the connection tube 303.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18, when the third filter housing F composing the water purification system having the plurality of filter carriages is rotated on the third connector E for replacement, the concentrated water discharge tube 306 is disposed at the rear portion of the connection tube 303. Accordingly, the third filter housing F can be easily replaced without interferences with the adjacent filter housing or hose (not shown).<br>
As depicted in FIGS. 20 and 21, the locking means for engaging the filter housing to the<br>
28<br><br>
connector includes:<br>
The locking means includes a lower cover which is engaged at a lower side of the connector and has a through hole at a center portion of the same, with the through hole being formed corresponding to a cap outer diameter of the filter housing; a pair of slide plates which are engaged between the connector and the lower cover and have opposite semicircular parts for allowing the opposite inclination elongated hole and collar of the filter housing to be detachably engaged, with the slide plates being pressurized in the facing direction by the elastic member; an isolation button means which has an isolation bar provided with the protrusion engaged at the inclination elongated hole, and a pressing bar which connects the ends of the isolation bars; and wherein the filter housing is separated from the connector as the isolation bar moves forward when the pressing bar is pressed, and the protrusion engaged at the inclination elongated hole moves forward, and slippery occurs between the side surface of the protrusion and the side surface of the elongated hole, so that the slide plates move in the vertical direction with respect to the moving direction of the protrusion and move in the distancing direction of the pair of the slide plates.<br>
When the filter housing 57 is engaged to the through hole of the lower cover 66 engaged at a lower side of the connector 55 and is moved upward, a circular collar 82a formed at an outer surface of the filter housing 82 is moved upward, being contacted with an inclined portion of the semicircular parts 93 and 94 of the slide plates 96 and 97. So, the slide plates 96 and 96 moved in opposite directions, and the protrusion 98 engaged to the inclination elongated holes 91 and 92<br>
29<br><br>
moves forward a little bit. Here, the protrusion engaged to the inclination elongated holes 91 and 92 is positioned at the centers of the inclination elongated holes 91 and 92.<br>
When the collar 82a moves over the inclination portions of the slide plates 96 and 97, the slide plates 96 and 97 move in the directions facing with each other by an elastic recovery force of the elastic member 95 for thereby restricting the collar 82a, so that the filter housing 57 is engaged to the connector 55.<br>
The water purification system easily exchangeable by the connector may be well adapted to a bidet, water purification device, ionization water dispenser, refrigerator, and other function water generators.<br>
As discussed earlier, in accordance with the present invention, the water purification filter easily replaced by the connector and the water purification system using the same have the following advantages.<br>
When the filter cartridge of the water purification system is disconnected for replacement, it is not necessary to lock the feed water locking valve to prevent leakage of feed water. Therefore, operational efficiency is improved.<br>
In addition, the connection structure of the water purification system is simplified by the structure of the reverse osmosis membrane filter having the paths of feed water, purified water and concentrated water as one port. As a result, the water purification system can be easily installed in a narrow space. The installation and assembly process of the filter cartridges can also be simplified to improve competitiveness.<br>
30<br><br>
Furthermore, the corresponding filter cartridge can be easily connected or disconnected to/from the water purification system, so that the general consumers can easily replace the filter.<br>

Dated this 20th day of September, 2007.<br><br>
The present invention discloses a water purification filter<br>
easily replaced by a connector which can simplify a connection<br>
structure of a water purification system by forming paths of feed<br>
water, purified water and concerntrated water as one port, and<br>
which can be easily replaced after disconnection of a filter<br>
cartridge from the water purification system, and a water<br>
purification system using the same. The water purification filter<br>
easily replaced by the connector includes a connector having an<br>
inflow hole through which feed water flows in, a check valve body<br>
in which an auto shut off valve for opening/closing a feed water<br>
flowing path for guiding feed water to a filter side and a<br>
concentrated water discharge path are formed, an outflow hole for<br>
externally discharging purified water, and a concentrated water<br>
controlhole for externally discharging concentrated water, a<br>
filter housing for opening the feed water flowing path by opening<br>
the auto shut off valve in connection with the connector, a<br>
locking means for detachably fixing the filter housing to the<br>
connector, and a passage switching guide having a first path for<br>
supplying feed water to a reverse osmosis membrane filter when<br>
the filter housing is connected to the connector, a second path<br>
for supplying water purified by the reverse osmosis membrane<br>
filter to the outflow hole, and a third path for supplying<br>
concentrated water to the concentrated water discharge path.<br></td>
