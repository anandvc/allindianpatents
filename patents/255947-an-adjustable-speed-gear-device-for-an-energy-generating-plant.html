				<td>A vanable-speed transmission for a povaer-generating plant<br>
Tl e invention relates to a variable-speed transmission for a power-generating<br>
p'ant, especially such a one which is driven by a fluid flow engine such as a wind-<br>
e lergy generator or hydro-electric generator and produces electric power by<br>
r leans of an electric generator.<br>
^ower-generating plants which remove kinetic energy from an air or water flow by<br>
Tieans of a power transducer show special characteristics for two reasons. On the<br>
one hand, the maximum available kinetic energy of the flow medium fluctuates<br>
over time. On the other hand, the power conversion of the kinetic energy of the<br>
flow into the kinetic energy of the power transducer (e.g. a wind rotor or a water<br>
turbine) shows inherent characteristics which assign to each flow speed an optimal<br>
speed of the power transducer in which a maximum power conversion occurs. The<br>
assigned flow speeds and the optimal speeds depend on the geometrical<br>
configuration of the power transducer. The associated flow speeds and the optimal<br>
rotational speeds depend on the dimensions and the geometrical configuration of<br>
the power transducer, ft follows from this that the power-generating plant such as<br>
a water or hydro electric plant must preferably be operated with a VBriable input<br>
speed which on its part must be adjusted as optimal as possible to the respectively<br>
appfed flow speed of the working medium.<br>
A further requirement placed on a power-generating plant as described above is<br>
obtained from the fact that the electric generator is connected to an interconnected<br>
network -grid which typically works with a constant system frequency. Since the<br>
constant system frequency concerns the primary control variable for stabilizing an<br>
interconnected network grid, the power supplied by the power-generating plant<br>
into the grid must be supplied in a frequency~and phase-conform manner. On the<br>
one hand, this can be achieved by a frequency converter which allows exciting a<br>
generator with the respectively required frequency to compensate the difference to<br>
the system frequency and to thus realize a variable-speed generator. The difficulty<br>
in this approach for power-generating plants driven by the kinetic energy of a flow<br><br>
r ledium is that the power absorption characteristics of a wind rotor or a water<br>
t irbine can be emulated only within limits for a frequency converter and complex<br>
r jquirements are placed on the open-loop or closed-loop control as a result of the<br>
s:iffness of the defined generator characteristics by the frequency converter. As a<br>
pasult, the known realizations where frequency converters are realized for linking a<br>
conventional power-generating plant to an interconnected grid network are not<br>
cotimal for the reason that harmonic loads on the grid and the generation of<br>
s gnificant reactive power are unavoidable. A contrary path is therefore described<br>
if the present application and a variable-speed transmission is proposed for a<br>
conventional power-generating plant whose output shaft revolves substantially<br>
v\ ith a constant speed and an input speed can be realized which is speed-variable<br>
a the same time and can be guided along an optimal setpoint speed. This enables<br>
both driving a speed-constant electric generator as well as realizing optimal power<br>
aosorption from the flow medium in the part-load range.<br>
T ie following approaches have become known for the transmission that meets<br>
these requirements:<br>
Ir a first system, the kinetic energy taken up by the power transducer from the flow<br>
rr edium is transmitted to a superposition gear. A power division to an electric<br>
g( ;nerator and a small servo-motor is realized in the superposition gear.<br>
Aijproximately one-third of the input power is usually transmitted to the<br>
servomotor. As a result of the fact that the servomotor is operated with different<br>
frequencies either as a motor or as a generator, the generator speed can be<br>
St abilized and that the generator can be operated in a frequency-locked manner<br>
ai d can be connected directly with the grid. The servomotor on its part is<br>
connected by a frequency converter to the grid or is supplied alternatively by an<br>
ai xiliary motor which is coupled mechanically with the generator. The described<br>
s&gt; stem is complex with respect to its control technology and is limited in its<br>
efficiency. The problems as explained above also occur when using frequency<br>
cc nverters.<br><br>
I ne electric servomotor is replaced in a second system which operates hydro-<br>
s atically by hydraulic pumps and motors. The problem of complex control<br>
c naracteristics also occur in this case. An additional factor is a sluggish response<br>
c naracteristic and relevant delay times and high non-linearity factors as a result of<br>
t ie hydraulic components.<br>
II power-generating plants such as wind and water power stations, there are<br>
1 jrther requirements in addition to the principal problems as described above in<br>
â€¢ ;onnection with the drive of an electric generator which is coupled with an<br>
nterconnected grid network. These arise from special operating states such as the<br>
jtarting or stopping process, the load shedding as a result of a serious grid<br>
nstabiiity or speed limitation on the input shaft under full load conditions. The latter<br>
equirement is obtained especially in wind power stations whose rotor blade tips<br>
should not exceed a certain speed in order to keep the noise below a certain<br>
[hreshold value. The respective threshold value can vary depending on the<br>
location of the wind power station such as an onshore or offshore location. Even in<br>
the case of the speed-limited wind power station, there should remain a certain<br>
softness in the reactivity, which means that under the occurrence of a wind gust<br>
even a speed-limited wind power station should allow an increase of the rotor<br>
speed for a short period which is then returned to the threshold value immediately<br>
thereafter. If the transmission meets such a requirement, any occurring power<br>
impulses can be limited. It is preferable vi/hen the additional energy made available<br>
by a wind gust is taken up by the power-generating plant and can be utilized in the<br>
form of higher power output.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a power-generating plant which<br>
comprises a transmission which meets the above requirements. Especially, the<br>
transmission should produce a substantially constant output speed for driving an<br>
electric generator coupled directly with an interconnected grid network. The input<br>
shaft should follow in a speed-variable manner the optimal power absorption<br>
characteristics for the power transducer such as the wind rotor or the water<br>
turbine. Moreover, the input speed should also be guidable or reducible above a<br><br>
predetermined threshold value. In addition to speed limitation, such operating<br>
: tates are starting or stopping phases or load shedding for example. A<br>
1 'ansmission for a power-generating plant is further provided which shows a<br>
lavorable control characteristic and a certain softness in the reactivity and is<br>
characterized by simplicity in construction and production.<br>
n order to achieve this object, the inventors have recognized that the power flow<br>
1 the transmission needs to be divided into at least two power branches with at<br>
east two hydraulic circulations. For this purpose, the transmission comprises in a<br>
)referred emibodiment a superposition gear which is at least indirectly in operative<br>
;onnection with the input shaft and divides the power flow among a first and<br>
second power branch. The first power branch is connected at least indirectly with<br>
he output shaft which drives the electric generator. The demanded constancy of<br>
he frequency of the output shaft is achieved by the open-loop or closed-loop<br>
control of the power flow in the second power branch.<br>
n accordance with the invention, the second power branch comprises at least two<br>
lydrodynamic circulations, with at least one of the hydrodynamic circulations<br>
producing an operative connection between the first power branch and the second<br>
jower branch on the driven side to the superposition gear. Notice must be taken<br>
hat the power flow in the second power branch can be directed both forwards or<br>
oackwards. The forwards direction shall be understood in such a way that the<br>
Dower flow occurs in the driven direction. In this case, the power introduction is set<br>
Tom the second to the first power branch by means of the hydrodynamic<br>
circulation connecting the first and the second power branch. If the power is<br>
guided back to the second power branch instead, meaning that it flows back from<br>
:he first power branch to the superposition gear, there is consequently a reactive<br>
Dower flow which can also be regulated in such a way that the mentioned<br>
requirements placed on the transmission of the power-generating plant are<br>
fulfilled.<br><br>
In addition to the first hydrodynamic circulation, the second power branch<br>
cj^mprises at least one second hydrodynan^iic circulation. The additional<br>
c )nstructional effort required for the second hydrodynamic circulation is offset by a<br>
Isrge number of advantages. On the one hand, the second hydrodynamic<br>
c rculation can have a different design or a different configuration in comparison<br>
with the first hydrodynamic circulation.<br>
.Suitable hydrodynamic circulations are hydrodynamic converters, hydrodynamic<br>
couplings, retarders and TRILOK torque converters. Each one of these<br>
lydrodynamic circulations offers benefits for certain applications or operating<br>
areas. If a hydrodynamic converter is used for coupling the first and second power<br>
oranch, then this leads to the special advantage that the characteristics of the<br>
nydrodynamiic converter correspond to the characteristics of a power transducer<br>
driven by a natural resource such as a wind rotor or a water turbine and for this<br>
reason the required constancy of the frequency of the driven shaft is obtained<br>
automatically as a result of self-regulation characteristics, which will be explained<br>
below in closer detail.<br>
Although it is not possible to realize any self-regulation characteristics for a<br>
hydrodynamic coupling, there are still advantages for a hydrodynamic coupling in<br>
comparison with a hydrodynamic converter due to the high efficiency in certain<br>
operating areas. This applies especially to the full-load area where the input speed<br>
of the transmission is guided and is limited in most cases. The TRILOK torque<br>
converter on the other hand combines advantages in certain operating areas with<br>
respect to efficiency and control characteristics. As a result, different<br>
hydrodynamic circulations each offer advantages for certain operating areas or<br>
operating states, so that different types of hydrodynamic circulations can be<br>
combined when using at least two hydrodynamic circulations. Depending on the<br>
requirements, it is then possible to switch between the hydrodynamic circulations<br>
or to change the respective weighting. This can be fulfilled in the easiest way by<br>
setting the filling level with working medium in the hydrodynamic circulations.<br><br>
In addition to tiie use of different designs of liydrodynamic circulations, it is also<br>
possible to use several similar types such as two hydrodynanriic converters which<br>
are arranged parallel in the second power branch. They differ by their design<br>
characteristics or as a result of transmission components assigned upstream or<br>
downstream. It is thus possible to adjust the transmission in accordance with the<br>
invention to different operating states. If different designs are available, it is also<br>
possible by changing the design to adjust in an improved manner to the time-<br>
changeable power potential of the natural resource.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the invention further provides that the second<br>
hydrodynamic circulation is used for the open-loop and closed-loop control of a<br>
first hydrodynamic circulation. The first hydrodynamic circulation usually assumes<br>
the task of regulating or controlling the power flow from the first power branch to<br>
the second power branch and vice-versa. This is usually achieved by a reaction<br>
member. These are the guide blades for a hydrodynamic circulation for example. If<br>
the requirement arises from a certain operating state that the self-regulation<br>
characteristic and the thus linked optimal setting of the guide blades is left, then it<br>
is necessary to change the originally optimal setting of the guide blades. This<br>
leads to flow losses in the hydrodynamic converter and a reduced efficiency in this<br>
connection. Moreover, a mechanical adjusting mechanism which is necessary for<br>
this purpose is not free from wear and tear, which plays a role in the respect that<br>
for all operating states outside of the self-regulation characteristic it is necessary to<br>
react to the fluctuating power input from the natural resource by providing a<br>
permanent change in the guide blade setting. In addition to the frequency of the<br>
setting of the guide blade position, it is also necessary to take note in this case of<br>
the usually high requirements placed on the reaction speed. With the second<br>
hydrodynamic circulation (e.g. a retarder), the necessary adjustment is not<br>
achieved by an adjusting movement of the action member, which in the case of a<br>
hydrodynamic converter are the guide blades, but rather by a weighting between<br>
the first and the second hydrodynamic circulation in the second power branch. If a<br>
change in the weighting on the other hand is produced by setting the respective<br><br><br>
filling level with working mediunn, such a change can be performed virtually without<br>
wear and tear and can be repeated as often as desired.<br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail by reference to the enclosed<br>
drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a variable-speed transmission with a first and second power<br>
branch, with the second power branch comprising a hydrodynamic<br>
converter and a hydrodynamic coupling.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the power/speed characteristics for a transmission according<br>
to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a variable-speed transmission with a first and second power<br>
branch, with the second power branch comprising two hydrodynamic<br>
converters.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the power/speed characteristics for a transmission according<br>
to Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a variable-speed transmission with a first and second power<br>
branch, with the second power branch comprising a hydrodynamic<br>
converter and a retarder.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the power/speed characteristics for a transmission according<br>
to Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 7 schematically shows the active-power curve at the best point of a<br>
wind power station.<br>
The rotor power Pr of a wind power station is in connection by approximation with<br>
the wind speed Vw:<br><br>
T ie expression k combines various constant values such as the blade geometry<br>
aid the density of the air. Cp further designates the power conversion coefficient,<br>
v/hich on its part depends on the wind speed Vw, the rotor speed lor and the<br>
inguiar position of the rotor blades, the so-called pitch angle p. This power<br>
;onversion coefTicient is characterized by a global maximum which shifts towards<br>
ligher rotor speeds ojr under rising wind speeds v^.<br>
Fig. 7 shows this connection by showing the real power of a wind rotor by taking<br>
various wind speeds into account. The figure shows a group of curves {continuous<br>
curves), which by way of example show the power taken up by a wind rotor with a<br>
diameter of 70 m from the air flow at constant rotor blade position for the wind<br>
speeds of 18 m/s, 16 m/s, 14 m/s, 12 m/s, 10 m/s, 8 m/s for various rotor speeds.<br>
The displacement of the optimal rotor speed towards higher values with rising wind<br>
speed is characteristic. The respective power maximums are situated on a curve<br>
which is also known as paraboUcs. Guiding the speed along this cuwe of optimal<br>
power absorption is designated below as power-optimal speed guidance for the<br>
input shaft of the transmission in accordance with the invention. A variable-speed<br>
system can thus be operated at optimal power conversion coefficients depending<br>
on the available wind speed. In addition to variable-speed operation at partial load,<br>
wind power stations are typically configured for certain nominal power in<br>
conjunction with a nominal speed which are each reached and held at full load.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the torque of the wind rotor for the above wind speeds for different<br>
rotor speeds on the basis of the group of curves shown with the broken lines. The<br>
illustrated torque cun/es are associated with the powers that depend on the wind<br>
speed, i.e. there is a torque value which belongs to each power-optima! speed,<br>
which does not correspond to the maximum torque at the respective wind speed<br>
but assumes another value (see in this connection the bold torque progress curve<br>
in Fig. 7). The electric generator is driven with this torque taken up by the wind<br><br>
otor via the transmission in accordance with the invention. The torque/speed ratio<br>
or a synchronous generator as shown in Fig. 7 proves that for an impressed<br>
system frequency of 50 Hz on the driven shaft of the transmission a constant<br>
speed of 15(D0 rpm (for this example) is predetermined on the driven side for the<br>
different transmitted torques, if an asynchronous generator is used instead of the<br>
synchronous generator, the situation can be seen accordingly, because in<br>
operation in the linear region it is possible to assume such a steep torque/speed<br>
ratio that the speed of the driven shaft of the transmission has a substantially<br>
constant value.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of a transmission 1 in accordance with the<br>
invention. It comprises a first power branch 7 and a second power branch 18, with<br>
two hydrodynamic circulations, a hydrodynamic converter 12 and a hydrodynamic<br>
coupling being arranged in parallel in the second power branch. Both are in an at<br>
least indirect operative connection with the first power branch 7. The illustration<br>
shows a transmission 1 in detail whose input shaft 2 is connected at least<br>
indirectly with a wind power station. In the present case, a first transmission 4 is<br>
positioned with a constant transmission ratio between the rotor 3 of the wind<br>
power station and the input shaft 2. In the embodiment as shown here, a<br>
superposition gear 5 for branching the power in transmission 1 (for example a<br>
planetary gear) is used, with the input shaft 2 being in connection with the planet<br>
carrier 6 and driving the same with speed n1.<br>
On the driven side to the superposition gear 5 there are now two power branches.<br>
The first power branch 7 guides power via the sun wheel 9 to the output shaft 10<br>
of the transmission 1. This output shaft 10 which revolves with a constant speed<br>
drives the electric generator 11 at least indirectly and is in operative connection<br>
with the hydrodynamic converter 12. For this purpose, the output shaft 10 is<br>
connected at least indirectly with the pump wheel 13 of the hydrodynamic<br>
converter 12. A guide wheel with adjusting blades is used as a reaction member<br>
15 in the hydrodynamic converter 12, with which the power flow to the turbine<br><br>
V heel 14 can be set. The reaction member is arrested at an optimized position in<br>
t le present embodiment during the operation of the transmission 1.<br>
" he turbine v/heel 14 of the converter 12 is in an at least indirect connection with a<br>
f jrther gear component in the second power branch 18 (e.g. a second<br>
! uperposition gear 22) which is used for the combination of the partial power flows<br>
lor the two hydrodynamic circulations. Each of the hydrodynamic circulations is<br>
jssociated with a partial power flow. A first partial power flow 18.1 occurs by the<br>
lydrodynamic converter 12 and a second partial power flow 18.2 by the other<br>
lydrodynamic coupling 30. For this purpose, the pump wheel 31 of the<br>
lydrodynamic coupling 30 is in an at least indirect operative connection with the<br>
irst power branch 7 and transmits, depending on the filling level with working<br>
Tiedium in the hydrodynamic coupling 30, a torque or a power flow via the turbine<br>
awheel 32 and an interposed gear component such as a stationary transmission<br>
16.2 to the further transmission components 16.2 and the second superposition<br>
gear 22.<br>
The relative ratio between the first partial power flow 18.1 and the second partial<br>
power flow 18.2 can be set by the filling levels with working medium in the<br>
hydrodynamic converter 12 and the hydrodynamic coupling 30. When there is a<br>
partial load condition on the energy-absorbing wind rotor 3, it is preferable to<br>
activate merely the hydrodynamic converter. The same comprises a respectively<br>
optimized, but fixed position of the reaction member 15. In the transition to full load<br>
there is a change to the hydrodynamic coupling, which allows reducing the rotor<br>
speed of the wind power station.<br>
Figure 2 shows the different operating ranges for a transmission according to Fig.<br>
1 where either the hydrodynamic converter 12 or the hydrodynamic coupling 30<br>
are activated. The illustration shows the mechanical output of the transmission 1<br>
depending on the input speed. A first transmission was omitted for reasons of<br>
simplification, so that the input speed corresponds to the rotor speed in the case of<br>
a wind power station. The output is stated in random units because the respective<br><br>
absolute values depend on the individual size and geometry of the power<br>
transducer of the power-generating plant. The transmission is operated in the<br>
converter range in the present embodiment for input numbers below 16.3 rpm. A<br>
group of cur^/es 201, 202, 203, 204 and 205 are shown. Each curve corresponds<br>
to a different setting of the reaction member 15 of the hydrodynamic converter 12.<br>
The transmission ratio in the superposition gear 5 and optionally the further gear<br>
components which may be provided upstream or downstream to the converter is<br>
chosen within the scope of the expertise of the person skilled in the art. Similarly,<br>
the dimensioning of the converter is adjusted, so that the power absorption<br>
characteristics of the rotor 3 of the wind power station is emulated substantially by<br>
the converter for an optimal position of the reaction member and that thus a<br>
constant speed can be achieved on the output shaft 10 within the terms of self-<br>
regulation characteristics. The wind rotor can thus be operated with the power-<br>
optimized speed along the parabolics. This optimal position of the reaction<br>
member 15 substantially corresponds to the one with the reference numeral 204.<br>
The electric power of the generator in the converter region will follow this<br>
characteristic accordingly, which is shown in Fig. 2 with a broken line 250 for the<br>
rotor speeds 
invention translates the typically low input speed into a high output speed which<br>
drives the generator. The hydrodynamic circulations which are arranged on the<br>
driven side to the superposition gear 5 for power branching in the second power<br>
branch can be operated with a high rotational speed and thus efficiently.<br>
In the present embodiment, it is necessary to provide a speed limitation of the<br>
wind rotor for higher power inputs. The reasons for this can be the noise<br>
development or aspects concerning the strength of individual components. For this<br>
purpose, a changeover is made to the hydrodynamic coupling 30 preferably above<br>
a certain speed threshold and the output follows the curve 210 which is associated<br>
with the hydrodynamic coupling. The precise position and the steepness of the<br>
characteristic curve can be configured by the dimensioning of the hydrodynamic<br>
coupling 30 and the gear components associated with the same upstream or<br><br>
downstream within the discretion of the person skilled in the art. In a further<br>
development, the transition between the converter region and the coupling region<br>
:an be switched in a graduated manner by partly filling or emptying the respective<br>
lydrodynamic circulations.<br>
n the coupling region, there is preferably such a steep characteristic curve of the<br>
lydrodynamic coupling 210, so that a limitation of the rotor speed is achieved<br>
vithin a wide margin.<br>
A changeover from the converter region to the coupling region is preferably also<br>
i nade for the above described transmission 1 in accordance with the invention<br>
when the hydrodynamic coupling 30 has a higher efficiency relative to the<br>
t lydrodynamic converter 12. Power losses in the transmission can thus be<br>
minimized.<br>
; Jince the hydrodynamic coupling 30 needs to be configured in a controllable<br>
nanner anyv/ay, it is preferred to run through with the hydrodynamic coupling 34<br>

[ ower-generating plant. Such a preferred application of the high dynamic coupling<br>

v/orking medium in the hydrodynamic converter 12 or the hydrodynamic coupling<br>

/, further preferred embodiment of the second power branch 18 of the<br>
transmission is shown in Fig. 3. The connection between the first power branch 7<br>
and the second part branch 18 is produced by two hydrodynamic circulations of<br>
t le same type, the first hydrodynamic converter 12 and a second hydrodynamic<br>
c Dnverter 24.<br>
1 he parallel partial power flows 18.1 and 18.2 in the second power branch 18<br>
V hich start out from the first hydrodynamic converter 12 and the second<br><br>
hydrodynannic converter 24 are combined by a further gear component (e.g. a<br>
second superposition gear 22) and guided back via the internal geared wheel 17<br>
to the superposition gear 5. Both the first as well as the second hydrodynamic<br>
converter each access the first power branch 7 at least indirectly via their pump<br>
wheels 13, 25 and are each at least in indirect operative connection with the<br>
second power branch 18 via the turbine wheels 14 and 27. The guide wheels 15<br>
and 28 are shown as being set in a fixed manner in the present case.<br>
By using two hydrodynamic converters 12, 24 in parallel pick-off from the first<br>
power branch 7 it is possible to switch between two different configurations of the<br>
transmission 1. The differences in design can be produced by the constructional<br>
adjustment of the first and second hydrodynamic converter 12 and 24 and by<br>
interposing additional gears in the partial branches. This is shown in Fig. 2 on the<br>
basis of stationary transmission 16.1 which is integrated in the partial branch<br>
starting from the first hydrodynamic converter 12 for the first partial power flow<br>
18.1. By using two hydrodynamic converters it is possible to extend the self-<br>
egulation characteristics of the transmission over a wide range of power input. It<br>
s also possible to configure the second hydrodynamic converter and possible<br>
downstream gear components in the second power branch in such a way that the<br>
second partial branch for the second partial power flow 18.2 is used for the<br>
ransition to the full-load region, such that rotor speed is guided along a setpoint<br>
;urve in addition to the speed of the output shaft which is kept substantially<br>
constant.<br>
The ratio of the partial power flows through the first hydrodynamic converter 12<br>
ind the second hydrodynamic converter 24 can be achieved in a wear-free<br>
nanner through a respective setting of the filling level with working medium. It is<br>
ilso possible to operate each hydrodynamic converter on its own. A parallel<br>
)peration and the individual setting of the speed/torque ratio for each<br>
jydrodynamic converter are possible. Moreover, a changeover is made according<br>
0 a preferred embodiment of the invention between the two hydrodynamic<br>
&gt; ;onverters 12, 23, which means that they are not operated simultaneously with the<br><br>
exception of one changeover range which is limited to a narrow speed interval. As<br>
a result, the entire power flow on the second power branch 18 outside of the<br>
changeover region is associated either to the first partial power flow 18.1 or the<br>
second partial power flow 18.2.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the family of characteristics 42 differently configured hydrodynamic<br>
converters 12 and 24 for a transmission in accordance with the invention<br>
according to Fig. 3. According to Fig. 2, the output of the transmission 1 is entered<br>
in random units against the input speed. A family of characteristics with broken<br>
lines is shown for the first hydrodynamic converter 12 the different settings of the<br>
reaction member 301, 302, 303, 304 and 305. The self-regulation characteristics<br>
are linked to an optimal setting of the reaction member which substantially remains<br>
the same. In the present illustrated case, this corresponds substantially to the<br>
setting with the reference numeral 304. The second hydrodynamic converter is<br>
configured for higher input speeds and shows a steeper family of characteristics.<br>
This is possible within the scope of the expertise of the person skilled in the art by<br>
respective dimensioning of the second hydrodynamic converter 24 and by<br>
providing upstream or downstream gear components. In Fig. 3, a stationary<br>
transmission 16.1 is associated on the turbine side to the first hydrodynamic<br>
converter for example, whereas this was omitted for the second hydrodynamic<br>
::onverter 24.<br>
n Fig. 4, the family of characteristics assigned to the second hydrodynamic<br>
converter 24 is outlined by the group of curves 401, 402, 403, 404 and 405, with<br>
each of these curves corresponding to a different position of the reaction member<br>
28 of the second hydrodynamic converter 24. In accordance with this, the group of<br>
curves 301, ^|, 303, 304 and 305 outline the input speed/output characteristics<br>
Df the transmission when filling the first hydrodynamic converter 12, each for<br>
different position of the reaction member 15.<br>
t is now possible to change over between the two groups of characteristics by<br>
naking a respective setting of the respective filling level with the working medium<br><br>
f 3r the two hydrodynamic converters 12, 24. This occurs in Fig. 4 above a rotor<br>
! peed of 15 rpm, so that the resulting ratio of the input speed and output for the<br>
t imbodiment of a transmission in accordance with the invention as shown here is<br>
designated v/ith the reference numeral 350, with an optimal setting of the reaction<br>
nember being chosen for both converters.<br>
-ig. 5 shows a further embodiment of a variable-speed transmission in accordance<br>
^ith the invention with a power branch between a first power branch 7 and a<br>
second power branch 18 by means of a superposition gear 5, with the second<br>
power branch 18 comprising two hydrodynamic circulations arranged in parallel. In<br>
the present case these are a hydrodynamic converter 12 and the retarder 20. The<br>
further components correspond to the drive trains according to figures 1 and 3 and<br>
are designated with corresponding reference numerals.<br>
As a modification to the embodiments as described above, the embodiment<br>
according to figure 5 only comprises a connection on the driven side of the first<br>
power branch 7 and of the second power branch 18 via a hydrodynamic converter<br>
12. Although the second hydrodynamic circulation in the second power branch 18<br>
(retarder 20) also acts back at least indirectly to the superposition gear 5, it does<br>
not link the first power branch 7 with the second power branch 18.<br>
Fig. 6 on the other hand shows that the retarder is used for leaving the region of<br>
power-optimal guidance in the transition to full load without requiring any<br>
adjustment in the first hydrodynamiic circulation, namely the hydrodynamic<br>
converter 12. It is operated with a constant setting of the reaction member 15, i.e.<br>
with a constant setting of the guide blades. Figure 6 again shows in detail the input<br>
speed entered against the output in random units. Below a speed threshold, which<br>
in the present case is slightly above 16 rpm, only the hydrodynamic converted 12<br>
is filled and operated with a fixed position of the guide wheel where the wind rotor<br>
revolves in a power-optimal manner. In the present example it substantially<br>
corresponds to the setting of the reaction member which is designated with the<br>
reference numeral 504. The further cur\/es 501, 502, 503 and 505 of the group of<br><br>
( haracteristics are assigned to further positions of the reaction member which are<br>
I ot optimal for the present case. The retarder 20 is filled above the mentioned<br>
I peed threshold, to which retarder there is assigned a retarder characteristic 600.<br>
I: is substantially steeper than the chosen converter characteristics, so that<br>
; ubstantially there is a limitation in the rotor speed. The thus resulting electric<br>
I lower output of the generator depending on the rotor speed is shown in figure 6<br>
' vith the curve 550 which is shown in a broken line.<br>
'he advantage of a transmission in accordance with the invention according to<br>
igure 5 as compared with a variant where the second hydrodynamic circulation<br>
which in this case is the retarder 20) is that in the event that the operating state of<br>
)Ower-optimal guidance of the wind power station needs to be left (e.g. because a<br>
imitation in the rotor speed becomes necessary under full load conditions for<br>
example) there is no mandatory change in the guide wheel position. Without the<br>
second hydrodynamic circulation it would then generally not be possible to work<br>
vith a substantially constant guide wheel position over a wide power range of the<br>
latural resource. Instead, the power flow via the hydrodynamic converter 12 would<br>
lave to be controlled actively via a time-variable setting of the guide wheel. In<br>
addition to the high requirements placed on the mechanical wear and tear and the<br>
eactivity, it is disadvantageous in such case that the hydrodynamic converter 12<br>
;an no longer be operated with the highest possible efficiency. According to figure<br>
3, an additional hydrodynamic circulation (which in this case is a retarder 20) is<br>
ntegrated in the second power branch 18 parallel to the hydrodynamic converter<br>
12. In order to avoid an adjustment of the guide wheel 15 of the hydrodynamic<br>
converter 12 for special operating states outside of the power-optimal operating<br>
state of the self-regulation, the filling level in retarder 20 is adjusted in such a way<br>
that the power flow is controllable on the second power branch 18 without<br>
changing the setting of the hydrodynamic converter 12. Moreover, it is also<br>
possible to change over completely from the hydrodynamic converter 12 to the<br>
retarder 30 iin accordance with the explanations above. In such a transition from<br>
the converter to the retarder region, the connection between the first power branch<br>
