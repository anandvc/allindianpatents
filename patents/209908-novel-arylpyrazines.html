"NOVEL ARYLPYRAZINES"<br>
NEUROGEN CORPORATION, a US corporation of of 35 Northeast Industrial Road, Brandford, Connecticut 06405, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
5	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional. Application Serial<br>
N6.60/I82,934 filed February 16, 2000 and of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.60/206,455 filed May 22, 2000, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION    10                The present invention relates to novel arylpyrazine compounds that have useful pharmacological properties in that they bind to cellular receptors, including CRF receptors. Certain of these compounds can bind to and modulate the activity of such receptors. Importantly, the compounds of the invention include compounds that bind with high selectivity and/or high affinity to CRF 1 receptors (Corticotropin 15     Releasing Factor type 1 Receptors). This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and to the use of such compounds as pharmaceutical agents, e.g., in treatment of psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases, including major depression, anxiety-related disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, supranuclear palsy and feeding disorders, as well as treatment of 2 0      immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress. Additionally this invention relates to the use such compounds as probes for the localization of cellular receptors in tissue sections.<br>
2	5     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide, is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. In addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone<br>
3	0     has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces<br>
a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in brain. There is also evidence that<br>
2<br><br>
a significant role in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors.<br>
Clinical data provide evidence that CRF has a role in psychiatric disorders and 5     neurological diseases including depression, anxiety-related disorders and feeding<br>
disorders. A role for CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer"s disease, Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in. the central nervous system.<br>
10<br>
In affective disorder, or major depression, the concentration of CRF is significantly increased in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of drug-free individuals. Furthermore, the density of CRF receptors is significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of suicide victims, consistent with a hypersecretion of CRF. In addition, there is a<br>
15     blunted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) response to CRF (i.v. administered) observed in<br>
depressed patients. Preclinical studies in rats and non-human primates provide additional support for the hypothesis that hypersecretion of CRF may be involved in the symptoms seen in human depression. There is also preliminary evidence that tricyclic antidepressants can alter CRF levels and thus modulate the numbers of CRF receptors in<br>
2 0     brain.<br>
CRF has also been implicated in the etiology of anxiety-related disorders. CRF produces anxiogenic effects in animals and interactions between benzodiazepine / non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics and CRF have been demonstrated in a variety of behavioral<br>
2	5     anxiety models. Preliminary studies using the putative CRF receptor antagonist -helical<br>
ovine CRF (9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms demonstrate that the antagonist produces "anxiolytic-like" effects that are qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines. Neurochemical, endocrine and receptor binding studies have all demonstrated interactions between CRF and benzodiazepine anxiolytics providing further evidence for the<br>
3	0     involvement of CRF in these disorders. Chlordiazepoxide attenuates the "anxiogenic"<br>
3<br><br>
effects of CRF in both the conflict test and in the acoustic startle test in rats. The<br>
benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, which was without behavioral activity<br>
alone in the operant conflict test, reversed the effects of CRF in a dose-dependent<br>
manner, while the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 enhanced the actions of CRF.<br>
5 ■	■<br>
CRF has also been implicated in the pathogeneisis of certain immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases such as hypertension, tachycardia and congestive heart failure, stroke and osteoporosis, as well as in premature birth, psychosocial    dwarfism, stress-induced fever, ulcer, diarrhea, post-operative ileus and colonic 10     hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress.<br>
The mechanisms and sites of action through which conventional anxiolytics and antidepressants produce their therapeutic effects remain to be fully elucidated. It has been hypothesized however, that they are involved in the suppression of CRF 15     hypersecretion that is observed in these disorders. Of particular interest are that<br>
preliminary studies examining the effects of a CRF receptor antagonist peptide (a-helical CRF9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms have demonstrated that the CRF antagonist produces "anxiolytic-like" effects qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines.<br>
2 0	Certain small molecule compounds for treatment of CRF related disorders<br>
have been disclosed in the literature [for a review see J. McCarthy et al. Curr. Pharm. Des. 5:289 (1999)]. However, none of these compounds has an arylpyrazine structure.<br>
Cox et al. (WO 98/38174) have disclosed certain aryl pyfazine derivatives for use 25      as sodium channel blockers in the treatment 6f central nervous system disorders. The Cox application requires that the arylpyrazine compounds be substituted with two-amino or amido groups.<br><br><br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
The compounds herein described may have one or more asymmetric centers or planes. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted<br>
25<br><br>
atom may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms (racemates), by asymmetric synthesis, or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. Resolution of the racemates can be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column. Many geometric isomers of olefins, ON double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. All chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric), and racemic forms, as well as all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated.<br>
The CRF antagonist compounds provided by this invention and labeled derivatives thereof are also useful as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to bind to the CRF receptor.<br>
Labeled derivatives the CRF antagonist compounds provided by this invention are also useful as radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or for single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).<br>
The term "substituted," as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom"s normal valence is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., =0), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers, By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include 11C, I3C, and 14C.<br><br>
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R*, then 5     said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R* groups and R* at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R*. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>

2	5	Preferred compounds of the invention will have certain pharmacological<br>
properties. Such properties include, but are not limited to oral bioavailability, low toxicity, low serum protein binding and desirable in vitro and in vivo half-lifes. Penetration of the blood brain barrier for compounds used to treat GNS disorders is necessary, while low brain levels of compounds used to treat periphereal disorders are<br>
3	0      often preferred.<br><br>
Assays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Toxicity to cultured hepatocyctes may be used to predict compound toxicity. Penetration of the blood brain barrier of a compound in humans may be predicted from the brairi levels of the compound in laboratory animals given the compound intravenously.<br>
Serum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcova, et al. (Journal of Chromatography B (1996) volume 677, pages 1-27).<br>
Compound half-life is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of a compound. In vitro half-lives of compounds may be predicted from assays of microsomal half-life as described by Kuhnz and Gieschen (Drug Metabolism and Disposition, (1998) volume 26, pages 1120-1127). Alternatively, compound half-life may be predicted from an in vitro microsomal assay such as the assay given in example 99b.<br>

PaUadiurn(O) represents a catalytic system made of a various combination of metal/ligand pair which includes, but not limited to, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), palladium(H) acetate/tri(o-tolyl)phosphine, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)/tri-5     tert-butylphosphine and dichloro[l, 1 "-bis(diphenylphosphine)ferrocene]palladium(0). Nickel(II) represents a nickel-containing catalyst such as [1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane]dichloronickel(II) and [1,3-<br>
bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]dichloronickel(II).  The arylpyrazine VII, when X is NH, may be further transformed to VIII by N-alkylation.   The N-H group is 10      deprotonated by a strong base such as but not limited to alkali metal hydride, alkali metal amide, or alkali metal alkoxide in inert solvents such as but not limited to THF, DMF, or methyl sulfoxide.   Alkylation may be conducted using alkyl halide, suitably bromide or iodide, at temperatures ranging from 0°C to 100°C.<br>

In an alternative way, compounds of Formula VII can be prepared as outlined in Scheme II.   Transition metal-catalyzed coupling of the halo pyrazine VI as described in the Method A can provide the intermediate VIII.   Oxidation of sterically less hindered<br>
2 0     nitrogen can be effected by using a variety of oxidizing agents known in the art, which includes /w-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, trifluoroperacetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and monoperoxyphthalic acid.   The N-oxide can undergo rearrangement to give chloropyrazine IX upon the action of phosphorus oxychloride at temperatures ranging from ambient to 100°C.  Displacement of the chloride with a nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur<br>
2 5     nucleophile as described in the Method A can furnish the compounds of Formula VII.<br><br><br>
Scheme III (Method C)<br><br><br><br>
Yet another way of preparing compounds of formula VTI is illustrated in the Scheme IE. Compounds of formula X, 3,6-dialkyl-2,5-dichloropyrazines, can be prepared from 2-alkylglycine according to a known literature procedure (Ref: Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin of Japan 1979,27, 2027).  Nucleophilic displacement of one chloride followed by Suzuki-type coupling at the other, as described in the Method A, can furnish the compounds of formula VII.<br>

Commercially available 2,6-Dichloropyrazine can undergo monosubstirution with nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur nucleophile to give XI.   Thus, X may react with an amine in solvents such as but not limited to dichloromethane, acetonitrile, THF, DMF, N-methylpyrrolidinone, methyl sulfoxide, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol at temperatures ranging from 0°C to the boiling point of the solvent.   In addition, X may<br><br><br><br>
react with a sodium or potassium (tmo)alkoxide m inert solvents such as but not limited to THF, DMF, N-methylpyrrolidinone, or methyl sulfoxide at temperatures ranging from 0°C to ambient temperature.  Resulting monochloropyrazine XI can be halogenated by using the conditions described in the Method A to give a mixture of regioisomeric bromides XIIa and XIIb.   Transition metal-catalyzed (hetero)aryl-aryl coupling of XIIa, as described in the Method A, followed by another halogenation can provide VII (R1 = Hal, R3 = CI) which can be further converted to VII by displacing one or both of the halgen atoms, either sequentially or simultaneously, with a variety of nucleophiles (R1-[M] and R3-[M]), same or different, in the presence or absence of a transition metal catalyst.   The aforementioned nucleophiles may include sodium or potassium (thio)alkoxide, alkylamine, and organometallic reagent such as but not limited to alkyl Grignard reagents, alkylboronic acids or its ester, or alkylstannanes.   The aforementioned transition metal catalyst may represent palladium or nickel catalysts described in the Method A.   The other regioisomeric bromide Xllb can also be converted to VII by changing the order of the transformation sequence.   Those who are skilled in the art will also recognize that one can further change the order of transformations to prepare the compounds of Formula VII by way of the intermediate XIII.<br>

Assay for CRF Receptor Binding Activity<br>
As discussed above, the following assay is defined herein as a standard in vitro<br>
2	0      CRF receptor binding assay.<br>
The pharmaceutical utility of compounds of this invention is indicated by the following assay for CRF1 receptor activity. The CRF receptor binding is performed using a modified version of the assay described by Grigoriadis and De Souza {Methods in Neurosciences, Vol, 5,1991). IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells, a cell-line that 25    naturally expresses the CRF1 receptor, are grown to confluency in DMEM containing FBS.<br>
To prepare receptor containing membranes cells are homogenized in wash buffer (50 mM Tris HC1,10 mM MgCl2,2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet is re-suspended in wash buffer and the homogenization<br>
3	0      and centrifugation steps are performed two additional times.<br>
107<br><br>
Membrane pellets containing CRF receptors are re-suspended in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.7 containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM EDTA and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 48000g. Membranes are washed again and brought to a final concentration of 1500 mg/ml in binding buffer (Tris buffer above with 0.1 % BSA, 15 mM bacitracin and 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin.). For the binding assay, 100 ml of the membrane preparation are added to 96 well microtube plates containing 100 ml of 125 I-CRF (SA 2200 Ci/mmol, final concentration of 100 pM) and 50 ml of test compound. Binding is carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates are then harvested on a Brandel 96 well cell harvester and filters are counted for gamma emissions on a Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Non specific binding is defined by 1 mM cold CRF. IC50 values are calculated with the non-linear curve fitting program RS/1 (BBN Software Products Corp., Cambridge, MA). The binding affinity for the compounds of Formula I expressed as IC50 value, generally ranges from about 0.5 nanomolar to about 10 micromolar. Preferred compounds of Formula I exhibit IC50 values of less than or equal to 1.5 micromolar, more preferred compounds of Formula I exhibit IC50 values of less than 500 nanomolar, still more preferred compounds of Formula I exhibit IC50 values of less than 100 nanomolar, and most preferred compound of Formula I exhibit IC50 values of less than 10 nanomolar. The compounds shown in Examples 1-95 and Examples 100-396 have been tested in this assay and found to exhibit ICS0 values of less than or equal to 1.5 micromolar.<br>

Additional Aspects of Preferred Compounds of the Invention<br>
The most preferred compounds of the invention are suitable for pharmaceutical use in treating human patients. Accordingly, such preferred compounds are non-toxic. They do not exhibit single or multiple dose acute or long-term toxicity, mutagenicity (e.g., as determined in a bacterial reverse mutation assay such as an Ames test), teratogenicity, tumorogenicity, or the like, and rarely trigger adverse effects (side effects) when administered at therapeutically effective dosages.<br>
Preferably, administration of such preferred compounds of the invention at certain doses (e.g., doses yielding therapeutically effective in vivo concentrations or preferably doses of 10, 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg/kg - preferably 150 mg/kg - administered<br>
i no<br>
109<br><br>
parenterally or prefrerably orally) does not result in prolongation of heart QT intervals (i.e., as determined by electrocardiography, e.g., in guinea pigs, minipigs or dogs). When administered daily for 5 or preferably ten days, such doses of such preferred compounds also do not cause liver enlargement resulting in an increase of liver to body weight ratio of more than 100%, preferably not more than 75% and more preferably not more than 50% over matched controls in laboratory rodents (e.g., mice or rats). In another aspect such doses of such preferred compounds also preferably do not cause liver enlargement resulting in an increase of liver to body weight ratio of more than 50%, preferably preferably not more than 25%, and more preferably not more than 10% over matched untreated controls in dogs or other non-rodent animals.<br>
In yet another aspect such doses of such preferred compounds also preferably do not promote the release of liver enzymes (e.g., ALT, LDH, or AST) from hepatocytes in vivo. Preferably such doses do not elevate such enzymes by more than 100%, preferably not by more than 75% and more preferably not by more than 50% over matched untreated controls in laboratory rodents. Similarly, concentrations (in culture media or other such solutions that are contacted and incubated with pells in vitro) equivalent to two, fold, preferably five-fold, and most preferably ten-fold the minimum in vivo therapeutic concentration do not cause release of any of such liver enzymes from hepatocytes in vitro.<br>
Because side effects are often due to undesirable receptor activation or antagonism, preferred compounds of the invention exert their receptor-modulatory effects with high selectivity. This means that they do not bind to certain other receptors (i.e., other than CRF receptors) with high affinity, but rather only bind to, activate, or inhibit the activity of such other receptors with affinity constants of greater than 100 nanomolar, preferably greater than 1 micromolar, more preferably greater than 10 micromolar and most preferably greater than 100 micromolar. Such receptors preferably are selected from the group including ion channel receptors, including sodium ion channel receptors, neurotransmitter receptors such as alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic receptors (particularly ml, m2, and m3 receptors), dopamine receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors; and also include histamine receptors and cytokine receptors, e.g.,<br>
110<br><br>
mterleukin receptors, particularly IL-8 receptors. The group of other receptors to which preferred compounds do not bind with high affinity also includes GABAA receptors, bioactive peptide receptors (including NPY and VTP receptors), neurokinin receptors, bradykinin receptors (e.g., BK1 receptors and BK2 receptors), and hormone receptors (including thyrotropin releasing hormone receptors and melanocyte-concentrating hormone receptors).<br>
Example 99a<br>
Absence of Sodium Ion Channel Activity<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention do not exhibit activity as Sodium ion channel blockers. Sodium channel activity may be measured a standard in vitro sodium channel binding assays such as the assay given by Brown et al. (J. Neurosci. (1986) 265: 17995-18004). Preferred compounds of the invention exhibit less than 15 percent inhibition, and more preferably less than 10 percent inhibition, of sodium channel specific ligand binding when present at a concentration of 4 uM. The sodium ion channel specific ligand used may be labeled batrachotoxinin, tetrodotoxin, or saxitoxin. Such assays, including the assay of Brown referred to above, are performed as a commercial service by CEREP, INC., Redmond, WA.<br>
Alternatively, sodium ion channel activity may be measured in vivo in an assay of anti-epileptic activity. Anti-epileptic activity of compounds may be measured by the ability of the compounds to inhibit hind limb extension in the supra maximal electro shock model. Male Han Wistar rats (150-200mg) are dosed i.p. with a suspension of 1 to 20 mg of test compound in 0.25% methylcellulose 2 hr. prior to test. A visual observation is carried out just prior to testing for the presence of ataxia. Using auricular electrodes a current of 200 mA, duration 200 millisec, is applied and the presence or absence of hind limb extension is noted. Preferred compounds of the invention do not exhibit significant anti-epileptic activity at the p

Optimal in vitro half-life<br>
Compound half-life values (t1/2 values) may be determined via the following standard liver microsomal half-life assay. Liver microsomes obtained from pooled liver samples and prepared so that the P-450 enzyme content is approximately 0.5 nmol/ mg protein. Reactions are preformed in a 5ml well deep-well plate as follows: Phosphate buffer: 19 mL 0.1 M NaH2P04, 81 mL 0.1 Na2HPC4, pH 7.4 with H3P04. CoFactor Mixture: 16.2 mg NADP, 45.4 mg Glucose-6-phosphate in 4 mL 100 mM MgCl2. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: 214.3 ul gIucose-6-phosphate. dehydrogenase, 1285.7 ul distilled water<br>
Starting Reaction Mixture: 3 mL CoFactor Mixture, 1.2 mL Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6 identical samples wells each containing 25 ul microsomes, 5 ul of test compound (from a 100 uM stock), and 399 ul 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, are prepared. A seventh well containing 25 ul microsomes, 399 ul 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 5 ul (from a 100 uM stock) of a compound, e.g. DIAZEPAM, CLOZEPINE, with known metabolic properties is used as a positive control. Reactions are preincubated at 39 °C for 10 minutes. 71 ul Starting Reaction Mixture is added to 5 of the 6 reaction wells and to the positive control well, 71 ul 100 mM MgCl2 is added to the sixth reaction well, which is used as a negative control. At each time point (0,1,3,5, and 10 minutes) 75 ul reaction is pipetted into a 96-well deep-well plate reaction well containing 75 ul ice-cold acetonitrile. Samples are vortexed and centrifuged 10 minutes at 6000 rpm (Sorval T 6000D rotor). Supernatant, 75 ul from each reaction well, is transferred to a 96-well plate containing 150 ul internal standard per well. The remaining test compound is quantitated via LCMS and Compound concentration vs time is plotted and commercially available statistical software is used to extrapolate to the tI/2 value of the test compound.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention exhibit in vitro t1/2 values of greater than 10 minutes and less than 4 hours. Most preferred compounds of the invention exhibit in vitro t1/2 values of between 30 minutes and 1 hour in human liver microsomes.<br>

Example 99c MDCK Toxicity<br>
Toxicity of a test compound may be assessed by measuring the effect of the compound on ATP production by MDCK cells.<br>
MDCK cells, product no. CCL-34, are purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA and maintained in sterile conditions by the methods described in the supplier"s production information sheet. The PACKARD BIOSCIENCE, (Groningen, The Netherlands) ATP-LITE-M Luminescent ATP decection kit, product no. 6016941, may be used to monitor ATP production in MDCK cells.<br>
Prior to assay 1 ul of test compound or control sample is pipetted into PACKARD (Meriden, CT) clear bottom 96-well plates. Test compounds and control samples are diluted in DMSO to give final concentration in the assay of 10 micromolar, 100 micromolar, or 200 micromolar. Control samples are drug compounds having known toxicity properties.<br>
Confluent MDCK cells are trypsinized, harvested, and diluted to a concentration of 0.1 x 106 cells/ ml with warm ATCC Eagle"s Minimum Essential Medium (catalog # 30-2003). Warm Eagle"s MEM without cells (lOOul) is pipetted in five wells a 96-well plate. These wells are used to determine the standard curve. Cells in Eagle"s MEM (lOOul or 10,000 cells) are pipetted into the remaining wells of the 96-well plates. All samples are incubated at 37 °C under carbogen (95% 02, 5% C02) for 2 hours with constant shaking. After incubation 50 ul mammalian cell lysis solution is added to well of the 96-well plates, wells are covered with Packard topseal stickers, and plates are shaken at approximately 700 rpm on a microtiter shaker for 2 minutes.<br>
During the incubation, Packard ATP Lite-M reagents are allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. Once equilibrated the lyophilized substrate solution in reconstituted in 5.5 mis of substrate buffer solution (from kit). Lyophilized ATP standard solution is reconstituted in deionized water to give a 10 mM stock. Standard (10 ul), diluted so that a 10 ul aliquot yields a final concentration of 200 nM, 100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, or 12.5 nM is added to each of the five standard curve wells, which do not contain cells.<br>
Substrate solution (50 ul) is added to all wells. Wells are covered with Packard<br>
113<br><br>
topseal stickers, and plates are shaken at approximately 700 rpm on a microtiter shaker for 2 minutes. A white Packard sticker is attached to the bottom of each plates and samples are dark adapted by wrapping plates in foil and placing in the dark for 10 minutes. Luminescence is then quantitated at 22 °C using a luminescence counter, e.g. Packard TopCount Microplate Scintillation and Luminescense Counter or Tecan Spectrafmor plus.<br>
Luminscence values at each concentration are compared to the values computed from the standard curve for that concentration. Preferred test compounds exhibit luminescence values 80 % or more of the standard, or preferably 90 % or more of the standard, when 10 micromolar concentration of the test compound is used. When a 100 micromolar concentraion of the test compound is used, preferred test compounds exhibit luminescence values 50 % or more of the standard, or more preferably 80 % or more of the standard.<br><br><br><br>
