				<td>Description<br>
Method and arrangement for testing a protective device<br>
processing digital sampling data<br>
The invention relates to a method for testing a protective<br>
device which processes digital sampling data, in particular for<br>
testing a protective device for electrical installations such<br>
as energy transfer systems.<br>
A protective device for energy transfer systems is sold, for<br>
example, by Siemens AG under the product name SIPROTEC In the<br>
case of this protective device, the method of operation of the<br>
protective device can be changed from the outside using a<br>
network or data bus connection by reparameterizing the device.<br>
During operation of the previously known protective device,<br>
digital sampling data are fed into the protective device and<br>
are evaluated. If, during this evaluation, the protective<br>
device determines that the sampling data indicate a fault, a<br>
fault or alarm signal is generated.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a method<br>
which can be used to test the functionality of protective<br>
devices, which process digital sampling data, in a particularly<br>
simple manner.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of<br>
the characterizing features of claim 1. Advantageous<br>
refinements of the method according to the invention are<br>
specified in subclaims.<br>
According thereto, the invention provides for a	stored fault<br>
value record of at least one converter - that	is to say a<br>
current or voltage converter, for example - to be	loaded into a<br>
testing device, for the data of the fault value	record to be<br>
used to form digital samples which<br><br>
correspond to the converter data recorded by the converter<br>
while the fault values are being recorded, for the digital<br>
samples formed to be embedded in digital network-compatible<br>
data packets, for the network-compatible data packets to be<br>
transmitted to a network-compatible interface of the protective<br>
device, and for the response of the protective device to the<br>
transmitted digital samples to be evaluated.<br>
The term network is understood below as meaning all types of<br>
data connection, in particular external data connections (for<br>
example in the form of an external data bus, an external<br>
Ethernet network or the Internet) or internal data connections<br>
(internal data bus inside a device or a device arrangement,<br>
internal networks inside a device or a device arrangement).<br>
A fundamental advantage of the method according to the<br>
invention can be seen in the fact that the protective device<br>
can be tested using any desired fault value records; this is<br>
because, according to the invention, the protective device is<br>
not tested using converter signals which are actually<br>
physically generated "afresh" but rather using "preserved"<br>
signal profiles instead which have been formed at any desired<br>
earlier times by any desired electrical converters. Performance<br>
of the method according to the invention thus requires<br>
considerably less outlay on devices or hardware than a method<br>
in which "real" converter data are used; this is because the<br>
converter data are generated solely in terms of software using<br>
"old" stored fault value records which are taken from fault<br>
value libraries or the like and therefore do not have to be<br>
generated afresh. The method according to the invention<br>
therefore makes it possible to provide digital samples in a<br>
very simple manner for the purpose of systematic and automated<br>
protective testing, for example on the basis of the IEC 61850-<br>
9-2 standard.<br><br>
Another fundamental advantage of the method according to the<br>
invention is that it can also be used to qualitatively compare<br>
digital converters, which output digital converter data, and<br>
analog converters, which output analog converter signals, by<br>
evaluating the response of the protective device to be tested<br>
to the network-compatible data packets, which have been fed in,<br>
on the basis of the source from which the data packets<br>
originally stem.<br>
During testing of the device, a fault value record of an analog<br>
converter is preferably processed using analog converter data<br>
and is used to form the network-compatible data packets. That<br>
is to say, if the fault value record of the converter is stored<br>
in Comtrade format, for example, the Comtrade-compatible<br>
signals are first of all converted into digital samples.<br>
Ethernet-compatible data packets are preferably formed as<br>
network-compatible data packets and are transmitted using an<br>
Ethernet-compatible network. For example, the Ethernet-<br>
compatible data packets are formed according to the IEC61850-9-<br>
2 standard.<br>
According to one particularly preferred variant of the method,<br>
the stored fault value records of at least two converters whose<br>
converter data have been recorded in time-correlated fashion<br>
are loaded into the testing device. The converter data of the<br>
fault value records are used to form converter-related digital<br>
samples for each of the converters. The converter-related<br>
samples formed are embedded in sampling-time-related data<br>
packets which each relate to the same sampling time, and the<br>
response of the protective device to the sampling-time-related<br>
data packets transmitted is evaluated.<br><br>
The samplinc-time-related data packets are formed, for example,<br>
in a manner compatible with the real-time Ethernet standard,<br>
with the IEC 61850 standard and/or with the IEEE 1588 standard.<br>
In order tc test the protective device, at least one fault<br>
value record which describes a fault which should be detected<br>
by the protective device according to a stipulation can be<br>
loaded, for example, into the testing device. After the<br>
network-compatible data packets have been transmitted, a status<br>
signal which indicates that the protective device has correctly<br>
detected the fault or has wrongly not detected the fault is<br>
then preferably generated. In order to form the status signal,<br>
monitoring can be carried out, for example, in order to<br>
determine whether or not the protective device has generated a<br>
fault or alarm signal after the network-compatible data packets<br>
have been transmitted.<br>
A multiplicity of different or identical test sequences are<br>
preferably transmitted, test sequence by test sequence, to the<br>
protective device and are tested there as part of the operation<br>
of testing the device in order to be able to obtain a statement<br>
on the method of operation of the protective device which is as<br>
consolidated as possible.<br>
For the rest, in the case of a test sequence which describes a<br>
fault, the testing device can be used to measure the triggering<br>
or response time of the protective device. For example, the<br>
testing device can also be used to determine the "quality" of<br>
the protective device by evaluating the measured triggering or<br>
response times of the protective device and forming a measured<br>
quality value on the basis of the measured values.<br>
The triggering times can also be measured in the form of<br>
triggering characteristic curves on the basis of the voltage<br><br>
and/or  current  values  which  have  been  transmitted  to  the<br>
protective device as converter data.<br>
It is also considered to be particularly advantageous if<br><br>
the testing device is configured or controlled via the network<br>
using a separate operating device. This makes it possible, for<br>
example, to accommodate the testing device in a "merging unit"<br>
or in a plurality of "merging units" which can be synchronized<br>
using the testing device in such a manner that even complex<br>
system disturbances can be represented. It is known that the<br>
function of a "merging unit" is to process phase-conductor-<br>
related samples of analog instrument transformers and to use<br>
them to forrr. data messages which can be processed further by a<br>
protective device which processes digital sampling data.<br>
The invention also relates to an arrangement having a<br>
protective device and a testing device, which is connected to<br>
the protective device via a network, for testing the protective<br>
device.<br>
In this respect, the invention is based on the object of<br>
specifying an arrangement which can be used to test protective<br>
devices, which process digital sampling data, in a particularly<br>
simple manner.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of<br>
an arrangement having the features of claim 15. Advantageous<br>
refinements of the arrangement according to the invention are<br>
specified in subclaims. As regards the advantages of the<br>
arrangement according to the invention and its advantageous<br>
refinements, reference is made to the statements made above in<br>
connection with the method according to the invention.<br>
In this context, it is only emphasized that a separate<br>
operating device which is connected to the testing device via<br>
the network and is suitable for controlling the sequence of the<br>
testing operation and/or configuring the testing device is<br>
considered to be very advantageous.<br><br>
A database, from which test sequences can be either directly<br>
transmitted to the testing device<br><br>
or can first of all be transmitted to the operating device and<br>
can be transmitted from there to the testing device, is also<br>
preferably connected to the network.<br>
For example, the operating device and/or the testing device<br>
is/are Internet-compatible and can communicate with the<br>
Internet in such a manner that a stored fault value record or<br>
test sequences can be loaded via the Internet, can be processed<br>
further by the testing device and can be used further to test<br>
the protective device.<br>
A field device for an electrical installation to be monitored,<br>
having an input for feeding in an analog or digital measurement<br>
signal which relates to the electrical installation to be<br>
monitored, and an evaluation device which is connected to the<br>
input and, in the event of the input-side measurement signal<br>
being applied, evaluates the latter and generates a fault<br>
signal if the measurement signal indicates a fault in the<br>
electrical installation to be monitored, is also considered to<br>
be an invention. Field devices may be formed, for example, by<br>
protective devices or power quality measuring devices.<br>
With regard to such a field device, the invention is based on<br>
the object of providing a simple but nevertheless reliable<br>
possible way of testing the field device.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by virtue<br>
of the fact that the field device has a device-internal testing<br>
device which is connected to the evaluation device and is<br>
suitable for generating a digital test signal itself or further<br>
processing an externally applied digital test signal, and for<br>
feeding the digital test signal into the evaluation device as a<br>
measurement signal after a test mode has been started in order<br>
to test the field device.<br><br>
A fundamental advantage of the field device according to the<br>
invention is that it makes it possible to test the device<br><br>
with very little outlay since a testing device for testing the<br>
field device has already been integrated in the latter<br>
according to the invention. There is therefore no need to first<br>
of all procure a separate testing device, which would give rise<br>
to additional costs, and to connect it to the field device<br>
before it is possible to test the field device.<br>
Another fundamental advantage of the field device according to<br>
the invention can be seen in the fact that: it uses digital test<br>
signals directly for testing. This makes it possible to test<br>
the digital testing algorithms implemented in the evaluation<br>
device without converter errors, which could arise when<br>
converting an analog test signal into a digital test signal,<br>
falsifying the test result. The method of operation of the<br>
evaluation device alone can therefore be tested without having<br>
to take into account the influence of a converter.<br>
It is considered to be particularly advantageous if the field<br>
device has a trigger input which is connected to the device-<br>
internal testing device, the testing device being configured in<br>
such a manner that it starts the test mode for testing the<br>
field device when a trigger signal is applied to the trigger<br>
input. This is because such a trigger input makes it possible<br>
to test an arrangement having a plurality of field devices in a<br>
synchronized manner by starting a temporally matched testing<br>
sequence for the entire arrangement by applying suitable<br>
trigger signals.<br>
As regards the use of stored or preserved fault value records<br>
which are stored, for example, in a database, it is considered<br>
to be advantageous if the device-internal testing device is<br>
suitable for loading an external fault value record and using<br>
the latter to form the digital test signal or for directly<br>
using the loaded fault value record further as a digital test<br>
signal.<br><br>
For example, the testing device is configured in such a manner<br>
that it uses the data of the external fault value record to<br>
form digital samples which correspond to converter data of at<br>
least one converter, which have been recorded while recording<br>
the fault values, and uses said samples to test the field<br>
device.<br>
The testing device is preferably also suitable for processing a<br>
fault value record of an analog converter using analog<br>
converter data and for using the latter to form the digital<br>
test signal. The testing device is preferably also suitable for<br>
further processing an external fault value record in Comtrade<br>
format.<br>
It is considered to be advantageous if the field device can<br>
carry out a test mode in network-compatible form; for this<br>
purpose, the testing device is preferably configured in such a<br>
manner that it embeds the digital test signal in digital<br>
network-compatible data packets, and transmits the network-<br>
compatible data packets to a device-internal network-compatible<br>
interface of the evaluation device via a device-internal<br>
network.<br>
The device-internal network can be formed, for example, by an<br>
Ethernet-compatible network or by a data bus according to the<br>
SPI or CAN standard. However, other network cards or types of<br>
data bus may also be suitable depending on the application.<br>
As regards temporally matched triggering of a plurality of<br>
field devices, it is considered to be advantageous if the<br>
device-internal testing device of the field devices can further<br>
process a time signal, which is applied to the trigger input,<br>
as a trigger signal by starting the respective test mode at a<br>
time defined by the time signal. Time signals thus allow, for<br>
example, the individual field devices to be started in a<br><br>
targeted manner in succession or in cascaded fashion rather<br>
than simultaneously.<br><br>
The field device preferably has a communication interface, in<br>
particular a network connection, the trigger input preferably<br>
being formed by this communication interface.<br>
If the evaluation device has a plurality of digital signal<br>
inputs, it is considered to be advantageous if a configuration<br>
file can be loaded into the testing device, said file<br>
stipulating that digital signal input of the evaluation device<br>
to which the digital test signal should be applied by the<br>
testing device. The testing device is preferably configured in<br>
such a manner that it can simultaneously apply a plurality of<br>
digital test signals to the evaluation device, the<br>
configuration file being able to be used to stipulate how the<br>
test signals should be assigned to the signal inputs of the<br>
evaluation device.<br>
As regards test results which are as reliable as possible, it<br>
is considered to be advantageous if the testing device is<br>
configured in such a manner that it feeds a digital test signal<br>
into the evaluation device repeatedly, in particular<br>
periodically repeatedly, in order to test the field device.<br>
Different scaling factors may be used, for example, in the<br>
event of the digital test signal being repeatedly fed in.<br>
For the purpose of logging the tests, it is considered to be<br>
advantageous if the testing device is configured in such a<br>
manner that it stores the test signal applied to the evaluation<br>
device and the corresponding response of the field device to<br>
said signal in the form of a fault recording while carrying out<br>
the test mode.<br>
The field device preferably has a fault signal output which can<br>
be disconnected and is intended to externally output the fault<br>
signal, the testing device being configured in such a manner<br>
that<br><br>
it disconnects or deactivates the fault signal output in the<br>
case of the test mode. Disconnecting or deactivating the fault<br>
signal output makes it possible to prevent an electrical<br>
installation, which is connected to the field device, or parts<br>
of said installation being inadvertently influenced by the<br>
field device during a test.<br>
If an external communication interface, for example an external<br>
network connection, forms the fault signal output of the field<br>
device, the evaluation device can generate, for example, a<br>
coded fault signal, which indicates the performance of a test,<br>
at the fault signal output in the case of the test mode.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for testing a field<br>
device arrangement having at least two field devices.<br>
In this respect, the invention is based on the object of<br>
specifying a test method which makes it possible to simulate<br>
even complex fault situations in electrical installations for<br>
test purposes.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by virtue<br>
of the fact that the field devices of the field device<br>
arrangement are tested in synchronized fashion.<br>
A fundamental advantage of the method according to the<br>
invention can be seen in the fact that it can be used to<br>
simulate even very complex fault situations, as can arise in<br>
complex electrical installations, in the form of "test<br>
patterns" for testing the field devices. For example, different<br>
temporal sequences are individually controlled or triggered<br>
inside the connected field devices.<br>
An output signal (for example fault signal, trigger signal,<br>
test results,<br><br>
intermediate results during the test, other evaluation signals)<br>
from another field device is preferably fed into at least one<br>
of the field devices in order to simulate and test<br>
intercorrelations between field devices. Such feeding in of<br>
output signals from other field devices may be expedient, for<br>
example, for testing a differential protective arrangement.<br>
For example, the field devices may use the output signal from<br>
other field devices further as a digital test signal or may use<br>
it to form their digital test signal. It is also possible for<br>
the field devices to use the output signal from other field<br>
devices further as a trigger signal or to use it to form their<br>
own trigger signal.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below using exemplary<br>
embodiments in which, by way of example:<br>
figure 1	shows  an  exemplary  embodiment  of  an<br>
arrangement according to the invention<br>
having a protective device, a testing<br>
device and a separate operating device; the<br>
arrangement is also used by way of example<br>
to explain the method according to the<br>
invention;<br>
figures 2 and 3    show,  by  way  of  example,  fault  value<br>
records which are intended to be used to<br>
test the protective device according to<br>
figure 1;<br>
figure 4	shows an exemplary embodiment of a field<br>
device according to the invention; and<br>
figure 5	shows an arrangement having a plurality of<br>
field devices according to figure 4, which<br>
is used by way of example to explain an<br><br>
exemplary  embodiment  of  a  test  method<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an Ethernet network or an<br><br>
Ethernet data bus 10 which is compatible with the IEC61850-9-2<br>
standard, with the real-time Ethernet standard, with the IEC<br>
61850 standard and/or with the IEEE 1588 standard and can be<br>
operated according to these standards.<br>
The network connection A20 of a merging unit 20 is connected to<br>
the Ethernet network 10. Analog voltage and current converters<br>
which are connected to an energy transfer system (not shown in<br>
any further detail in figure 1) and record analog current and<br>
voltage measured values U and I of the energy transfer system<br>
and transmit them to the merging unit 20 are connected to the<br>
merging unit 20. For the sake of clarity, the analog voltage<br>
and current converters are shown only diagrammatically in<br>
figure 1 and are denoted using the reference symbols 30 and 40.<br>
The voltage and current converters 30 and 40 are connected to<br>
the merging unit 20 by means of analog 1/5 A or 100 V<br>
interfaces E20a and E20b, for example.<br>
As can also be gathered from figure 1, a testing device 50<br>
which is connected to a control device (for example<br>
microprocessor device) 20' of the merging unit 20 or is<br>
integrated therein is integrated in the merging unit 20; the<br>
method of operation of the testing device 50 is explained<br>
further below.<br>
A protective device 60, a database 70 and an operating device<br>
80 for operating, controlling and configuring the testing<br>
device 50 of the merging unit 20 are also connected to the<br>
Ethernet network 10.<br>
The arrangement according to figure 1 is operated as follows:<br>
Before the protective device 60 is used to monitor the energy<br>
transfer system, the testing device 50 is used to check the<br>
correct method of operation of the protective device 60. For<br><br><br><br>
fault value records stored in Comtrade format are read from the<br>
database 70 using the operating device 80 and are transmitted<br>
to the testing device 50.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show, by way of example and only<br>
diagrammatically, fault value records in the form of analog<br>
voltage and current profiles U(t) and I(t) within a fault value<br>
recording interval At. A fault value record U(t) and I(t) thus<br>
comprises a multiplicity of individual measured values at<br>
different times t within the respective fault value recording<br>
interval At.<br>
The testing device 50 receives the fault value records as data<br>
packets DU and DI and converts them into digital samples which<br>
correspond to the converter signals recorded by the fault value<br>
recording converters during the respective fault value<br>
recording process.<br>
The testing device 50 then embeds the samples formed in this<br>
manner from the fault value records in digital network-<br>
compatible test data packets Dtest according to the IEC61850-9-<br>
2 standard and transmits them, via its network connection A20,<br>
to a network-compatible interface D60 of the protective device<br>
60.<br>
In this case, the test data packets Dtest are preferably<br>
transmitted in such a manner that the protective device 60 does<br>
not need to distinguish them from other data packets of the<br>
merging unit 20 which are formed during subsequent "normal<br>
operation" of the merging unit 20 using the analog current and<br>
voltage measured values U and I of the analog voltage and<br>
current converters 30 and 40.<br>
The operating device 80 is preferably used to transmit fault<br>
value records, which indicate faults which should be detected<br>
by the protective device 60, to the testing device. In this<br><br>
case, the operating device 80 monitors whether the protective<br>
device 60<br><br>
detects the respective faults and generates corresponding fault<br>
signals F. If this is the case, the protective device 60 is<br>
operating correctly and can be used to monitor the energy<br>
transfer system and to evaluate the analog current and voltage<br>
measured values U and I of the voltage and current converters<br>
30 and 40; in contrast, if the protective device 60 is not<br>
operating correctly, suitable maintenance or replacement work<br>
should be carried out.<br>
In addition, it is possible to quantitatively detect the<br>
quality of the protective device 60 by measuring and evaluating<br>
the response or triggering times of the protective device 60 on<br>
the basis of the current and/or voltage values of the fault<br>
value records that have been fed in. For example, in order to<br>
assess the quality, the triggering times may be recorded in the<br>
form of triggering characteristic curves on the basis of the<br>
voltage and/or current values which have been fed in.<br>
As regards testing of the protective device 60 which is as<br>
comprehensive as possible, a multiplicity of fault value<br>
records may, for the rest, be fed into the protective device 60<br>
in the form of repetitively transmitted test sequences and the<br>
response of the protective device may be recorded as described.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to figure 1, the testing<br>
device 50 is accommodated in the merging unit 20, for example.<br>
Alternatively, the testing device 50 may also be integrated in<br>
the operating device 80, which is formed, for example, by a<br>
data processing system, for example a personal computer or the<br>
like, or in the protective device 60. Instead of this, it is<br>
also possible to directly connect the testing device 50 to the<br>
Ethernet network 10 as an independent device; the testing<br>
device 50 may be formed, for example, by an appropriately<br>
programmed data processing system such as a personal computer<br>
or the like.<br><br>
A corresponding situation applies to the operating device 80:<br>
in the exemplary embodiment according to figure 1, the<br>
operating device 80, which is formed, for example, by an<br>
appropriately programmed data processing system such as a<br>
personal computer or the like, is directly connected to the<br>
Ethernet network 10 as an independent device. Alternatively,<br>
the operating device 80 may also be integrated in the merging<br>
unit 20 or in the protective device 60.<br>
For the rest, the operating device 80 and the database 70 need<br>
not be directly connected to the Ethernet network 10; instead<br>
of this, these components may also be connected to the Ethernet<br>
network 10, and to the devices connected to the latter, via the<br>
Internet. In other words, it is thus conceivable to download<br>
test sequences for testing the protective device 60 from<br>
databases which are connected to the Internet and to use them<br>
for testing.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a field device<br>
according to the invention. The field device is a protective<br>
device which is denoted using the reference symbol 200 in<br>
figure 4.<br>
The protective device 200 has a multiplicity of analog inputs<br>
for feeding in analog measurement signals; three of these<br>
inputs are illustrated by way of example in figure 4 and are<br>
denoted using the reference symbols E200a, E200b and E200c.<br>
Each of these analog inputs E200a, E200b and E200c is<br>
respectively connected to digital signal inputs S220 of a<br>
digitally operating evaluation device 220, that is to say an<br>
evaluation device which processes digital input signals, via an<br>
A/D converter unit 210.<br>
When the analog measurement signals are applied to the analog<br>
inputs E200a, E200b and E200c, the evaluation device 220<br><br>
evaluates them following analog/digital conversion and<br>
generates a fault signal F if the applied digital measurement<br>
signals indicate a fault in an electrical installation which is<br>
connected<br><br>
to the analog inputs E200a, E200b and E200c and is not<br>
illustrated in figure 4 for the sake of clarity.<br>
In order to output the fault signal F, the evaluation device<br>
220 is connected to an external communication interface 230<br>
which forms, inter alia, a fault signal output of the<br>
protective device 200.<br>
In addition, the external communication interface 230 forms an<br>
input for feeding digital measurement signals into the<br>
evaluation device 220. For this purpose, the external<br>
communication interface 230 is connected to the digital signal<br>
inputs S220 of the evaluation device 220, to be precise via a<br>
device-internal connecting device 240. The device-internal<br>
connecting device 240 may be, for example, an internal data bus<br>
(for example SPI or CAN standard) or an internal network (for<br>
example Ethernet) or the like.<br>
The external communication interface 230 thus makes it possible<br>
to feed digital measurement signals, which may likewise relate<br>
to an electrical installation which is connected to the<br>
protective device 200, for example to the same electrical<br>
installation which has been or is connected to the analog<br>
inputs E200a, E200b and E200c, into the evaluation device 220.<br>
The protective device 200 thus makes it possible to evaluate<br>
both analog and digital measurement signals.<br>
In order to make it possible to test the protective device 200<br>
in a simple manner, it additionally has a device-internal<br>
testing device 250 which is connected to both the evaluation<br>
device 220 and the external communication interface 230 via the<br>
device-internal connecting device 240 and enables a test mode<br>
of the protective device.<br><br>
During the test mode, the device-internal testing device 250 is<br>
able to feed digital test signals Te into the evaluation device<br>
220 via the device-internal connecting device 240; it uses the<br>
digital signal inputs S220 of the evaluation device 220 for<br>
this purpose. As part of the test mode, the evaluation device<br>
220 evaluates the test signals Te applied to the input side, to<br>
be precise exactly like the digital measurement signals applied<br>
during normal operation or measurement signals of the connected<br>
electrical installation which have been subjected to<br>
analog/digital conversion, and generates a fault signal F at<br>
the external communication interface 230 if the digital test<br>
signals indicate a fault.<br>
In order to be able to influence the protective device 200 from<br>
the outside in such a manner that the test mode is triggered at<br>
quite particular times, the protective device 200 has a trigger<br>
input which is likewise formed by the external communication<br>
interface 230. It is thus possible to feed a trigger signal Tr<br>
into the protective device 200 and thus into the testing device<br>
250 from the outside and to trigger the test mode of the<br>
protective device. When the trigger signal Tr is present at a<br>
connection A250 of the testing device 250, the latter generates<br>
the digital test signals Te which are used to test the<br>
evaluation device 220.<br>
The digital test signals Te may be predefined or set in advance<br>
from the outside. It is thus possible, for example, to transmit<br>
specific digital test signals Te to the testing device 250 from<br>
the outside via the external communication interface 230 and to<br>
store them in said testing device so that the testing device<br>
250 can feed the digital test signals Te into the evaluation<br>
device 220 as digital measurement signals at a later time. The<br>
digital test signals Te may have been formed, for example, by<br>
simulating or evaluating fault value records which have been<br>
recorded in real electrical installations.<br><br>
Alternatively, it is possible to directly transmit digital or<br>
analog fault value records to the testing device 250 via the<br>
communication interface 230 so that the testing device 250 can<br>
use them to generate the digital test signals Te themselves.<br>
It is also possible to transmit control signals ST, which<br>
trigger particular test patterns which have been preinstalled<br>
in the testing device 250, to the testing device 250 via the<br>
external communication interface 230. In such a case, the<br>
control signal ST thus stipulates which test signals Te should<br>
be transmitted to the evaluation device 220. As part of such<br>
control signal transmission, scaling factors or the like may<br>
also be concomitantly transmitted, for example, which scaling<br>
factors indicate the manner in which the test patterns which<br>
have been preinstalled in the testing device 250 should be<br>
rescaled in order to obtain the desired digital test signals<br>
Te.<br>
If fault value records are transmitted to the testing device<br>
250 via the communication interface 230, this is preferably<br>
carried out in the so-called Comtrade format (Common Format for<br>
Transient Data - IEEE C37.111 - 1999).<br>
In order to stipulate which internal digital signal inputs S220<br>
of the evaluation device 220 should process the digital test<br>
signals Te further, a configuration file may also be<br>
transmitted to the testing device 250 via the communication<br>
interface 230, which file stipulates how the digital test<br>
signals Te should be assigned to the individual signal inputs<br>
of the evaluation device 220. In this manner, it is possible,<br>
for example, to address and test each of the digital signal<br>
inputs S220 of the evaluation device 220 separately in order to<br>
ensure that each individual signal input of the digital signal<br>
inputs S220 is operating correctly.<br><br>
In order to avoid a fault signal F, which is generated during a<br>
test mode or test cycle using the protective device 200,<br>
resulting in triggering of a safety response, for example<br>
disconnection of an electrical installation which is connected<br>
to the protective device 200, the protective device 200 is<br>
configured in such a manner that, during a test mode, an<br>
indication is additionally given when outputting the fault<br>
signal F via the external communication interface 230 that it<br>
is a fault signal generated as part of a test mode.<br>
Alternatively, during the test mode, the fault signal output<br>
formed by the communication interface 230 may also be<br>
disconnected in terms of hardware in order to suppress<br>
undesirable output of the fault signal F.<br>
The evaluation device 220 is preferably configured in such a<br>
manner that it stores the analog or digital measurement signals<br>
applied to the input side as well as the fault signals<br>
generated on the basis of these measurement signals in the form<br>
of fault recordings (for example in Comtrade format) in order<br>
to subsequently make it possible to read out and further<br>
process these data. The communication interface 230, for<br>
example, may be used for this purpose. The evaluation device<br>
220 preferably generates such fault recordings both for the<br>
normal operating mode, in which a real electrical installation<br>
is monitored metrologically and "real" fault signals are<br>
generated, and for the test mode in which the digital test<br>
signals Te of the testing device 250 are processed for test<br>
purposes and test fault signals are generated.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to figure 4, it was<br>
assumed, for example, that the testing device 250 and the<br>
evaluation device 220 are separate subcomponents;<br>
alternatively, the testing device 250 and evaluation device 220<br>
may also be formed by a single control device (for example a<br>
microprocessor arrangement) in which the testing device 250 and<br><br>
the evaluation device 220 are implemented in terms of software<br>
in the form of software modules. In this case,<br><br>
the testing device 250 and the evaluation device 220 may be<br>
formed by installing an appropriate computer program product in<br>
the microprocessor arrangement.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a field device arrangement having two<br>
field devices which can be used to simulate even complex system<br>
disturbances and can thus be used for test purposes.<br>
Figure 5 shows an electrical installation 300 to which two<br>
protective devices 310 and 320 are connected. The design, for<br>
example, of the two protective devices 310 and 320 may<br>
correspond to that of the protective device 200 according to<br>
figure 4.<br>
The analog inputs E310a, E310b and E310c and E320a, E320b and<br>
E320c, which correspond to the inputs E200a, E200b and E200c<br>
according to figure 4, of the two protective devices 310 and<br>
320 are respectively connected to the electrical installation<br>
300 in such a manner that analog measurement signals Mai to Ma6<br>
are fed into the two protective devices 310 and 320. These<br>
signals are converted into digital measurement signals by A/D<br>
converter units contained in the protective devices and are<br>
then evaluated by an evaluation device of the respective<br>
protective device. In this respect, reference is made to the<br>
statements made above in connection with figure 4.<br>
Figure 5 also shows a device-external network 330 which<br>
connects communication interfaces K310 and K320 of the two<br>
protective devices 310 and 320, which respectively correspond<br>
to the communication interface 230 according to figure 4, to<br>
one another.<br>
An external operating device 340 which can be used to control<br>
the two protective devices 310 and 320 from the outside is also<br>
connected to the device-external network 330. The operating<br>
device 340 thus allows a trigger signal Tr1 to be fed into the<br><br>
protective device 310 and a further trigger signal Tr2<br><br>
to be fed into the protective device 320. The two trigger<br>
signals Tr1 and Tr2 may be fed into the two protective devices<br>
at the same time if the latter are intended to be switched into<br>
a test mode at the same time. Alternatively, it is possible to<br>
generate the two trigger signals Trl and Tr2 with a temporal<br>
offset in order to change the two protective devices to their<br>
test mode at different times but nevertheless in synchronized<br>
fashion.<br>
In addition, the operating device 340 allows the digital test<br>
signals Tel and Te2 which are to be used for the test mode to<br>
be transmitted to the respective protective devices 310 and 320<br>
via the device-external network 330. Instead of the digital<br>
test signals Tel and Te2 which are intended to be used for the<br>
test mode, files, for example in the form of fault value<br>
records in Comtrade format, may also be transmitted to the<br>
protective devices and are used by the protective devices to<br>
form the definitive test signals Tel and Te2 themselves. In<br>
such a case, the trigger signals Trl and Tr2 are preferably<br>
generated only when the test signals Tel and Te2 to be used for<br>
the test mode have already been fully implemented in the<br>
protective devices 310 and 320 via the network 330 and have<br>
been prepared therein.<br>
As soon as the trigger signals Trl and Tr2 have triggered the<br>
test mode in their respective associated protective device 310<br>
and 320, the device-internal testing devices contained in the<br>
two protective devices 310 and 320 respectively generate the<br>
digital test signals Tel and Te2 previously defined using the<br>
operating device 340 and feed them into the respective<br>
associated evaluation device. As regards the interaction<br>
between the testing device and the evaluation device in each of<br>
the two protective devices 310 and 320, reference is made to<br>
the statements made above in connection with the protective<br>
device 200 according to figure 4.<br><br>
In addition to solely external triggering of the two protective<br>
devices 310 and 320 using the operating device 340, it is also<br>
possible to operate the two protective devices in such a manner<br>
that they communicate with one another. It is thus possible,<br>
for example, for one of the two protective devices (for example<br>
the protective device 310) to trigger another protective device<br>
(for example the protective device 320) via the device-external<br>
network 320.. The time for such triggering by the protective<br>
device may be dependent, for example, on whether and when<br>
trigger states (for example ascertainment of a fault, exceeding<br>
of predefined measured value limits, etc.) predefined in the<br>
triggering protective device are determined.<br>
It is also possible for one of the two protective devices (for<br>
example the protective device 310) to feed measurement signals,<br>
evaluation signals generated by itself or externally predefined<br>
evaluation signals, intermediate signals generated by itself or<br>
the like into the other protective device (for example the<br>
protective device 320) via the device-external network 320,<br>
with the result that the other protective device can use the<br>
received signals further as test signals Te2 or can use them to<br>
form its own test signals Te2. In this case, the protective<br>
devices would "cooperate" and would be tested as a unit, as a<br>
result of which even very complex fault situations can be<br>
simulated and used for test purposes.<br><br>

that<br>
the testing device is configured in such a manner that it<br>
can simultaneously apply a plurality of digital test<br>
signals to the evaluation device,<br>
the configuration file being able to be used to stipulate<br>
how the test signals should be assigned to the signal<br>
inputs of the evaluation device.<br>
32.	The field device as claimed in one of the preceding claims<br>
20-31, characterized in that the testing device is configured<br>
in such a manner that it feeds a digital test signal into the<br>
evaluation  device  repeatedly,  in  particular  periodically<br>
repeatedly, in order to test the field device.<br>
33.	The field device as claimed in claim 32, characterized in<br>
that the testing device is configured in such a manner that it<br>
uses different scaling factors in the event of the digital test<br>
signal being repeatedly fed in.<br>
34.	The field device as claimed in one of the preceding claims<br>
20-33, characterized in that the testing device is configured<br>
in such a manner that it stores the test signal applied to the<br>
evaluation device and the corresponding response of the field<br>
device to said signal in the form of a fault recording while<br>
carrying out the test mode.<br><br>
35.	The field device as claimed in one of the preceding claims<br>
20-34, characterized in that<br>
the field device has a fault signal output which can be<br>
disconnected and is intended to externally output the<br>
fault signal, and<br>
in that the testing device is configured in such a manner<br>
that it disconnects or deactivates the fault signal output<br>
in the case of the test mode.<br>
36.	The field device as claimed in one of the preceding claims<br>
20-35, characterized in that<br>
a communication interface (230) of the field device forms<br>
a fault signal output for externally outputting the fault<br>
signal, and<br>
- in that the evaluation device is configured in such a<br>
manner that it generates a coded fault signal, which<br>
indicates the performance of a test, at the external<br>
communication interface (230) in the case of the test<br>
mode.<br>
37.	A method for testing a field device arrangement having at<br>
least two field devices (310, 320) as claimed in one of the<br>
preceding claims 21 to 36,  characterized in that the field<br>
devices  of  the  field  device  arrangement  are  tested  in<br>
synchronized fashion.<br>
38.	The method as claimed in claim 37, characterized in that a<br>
trigger signal (Tr1, Tr2) is respectively applied to each of<br>
the field devices in such a manner that the field devices carry<br>
out their respective test mode in time-correlated fashion with<br>
respect to one another.<br>
39.	The method as claimed in claim 37 or 38, characterized in<br>
that an output signal from another field device is fed into at<br>
least one of the field devices.<br><br>
40. The method as claimed in claim 39, characterized in that<br>
the at least one field advice uses the output signal from the<br>
other<br><br>
field device further as a digital test signal or uses it to<br>
form its digital test signal.<br>
41. The method as claimed in claim 39 or 40, characterized in<br>
that the at least one field device uses the output signal from<br>
the other field device further as a trigger signal or uses it<br>
to form its trigger signal.<br><br>
The invention relates, among other things, to a method for<br>
testing a protective device that processes digital sampling<br>
data.The aim of the invention is to create a method which<br>
allows protective devices to be tested in a particularly simple<br>
fashion regarding the serviceability thereof. Said aim is<br>
achieved by loading a stored fault record (DU, DI) of at least<br>
one converter into a testing device (50), forming, by means of<br>
the data of said fault record, digital sampling values which<br>
correspond to the converter data recorded by the converter<br>
during the fault recording process, embedding the formed digital<br>
sampling values into digital network-compatible data packets<br>
(Dtest), transmitting said network-compatible data packets<br>
(Dtest) to a network-compatible interface (D60) of the<br>
protective device (60), and evaluating the reaction of the<br>
protective device to the transmitted digital sampling value.</td>
