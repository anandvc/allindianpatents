				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM OF FRICTION WELDING<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present disclosure relates to a method and system of friction welding<br>
together parts.<br>
There are generally two types of rotational friction welding, namely, inertia<br>
friction welding and direct drive friction welding. During a friction weld cycle, material.<br>
from the work parts is displaced or "upset" which results in a reduction of the combined<br>
length of the welded parts. Thus, the finished product length is the sum of the length of<br>
the parts before the weld minus the effect of the upset experienced by the pans duriin; the<br>
weld. Upset, and thus final product length, in friction welding is a variable that needs lo<br>
be considered in friction welding. With increased demands on manufacturing tolerances<br>
it is desirable that friction welding processes consistently produce welded parts with<br>
lower tolerances of upset and produce consistent overall welded part lengths.<br>
In inertia welding, upset is primarily dependent on starting energy (determined by<br>
starting speed and system inertia) and the load applied throughout the weld cycle.<br>
However, upset is also dependent on work part interfacial area, actual contact area<br>
between work parts and metallurgical properties, among other factors. Small variations<br>
in these variables are not compensated for and result in large variations in upset.<br>
Controlling upset in direct drive friction welding consists of monitoring upset<br>
during the friction phase of the weld cycle, and transitioning to the forge/braking phase<br>
when the desired upset is achieved. Once the rotational driving force is disconfinned ;:il<br>
the end of the friction phase, though, upset occurs in an uncontrolled or natural process,<br>
dependent on prior energy, input (determined by friction speed, applied load, and time),<br>
system inertia, and the friction/forge load applied as the spindle rotationally decelerates<br>
to rest.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present disclosure comprises one or more of the following features or<br>
combinations thereof disclosed herein or in the Detailed Description below.<br>
The present disclosure relates to a system arid a method of direct drive friction<br>
welding together parts to produce welds having either reduced upset variation or reduced<br>
variation of the final length of the welded-together production parts. The present<br>
disclosure also relates to a method of inertia friction welding together parts to produce<br>
welds having reduced upset variation.<br>
Reducing upset variation is achieved by dynamically controlling motor torque<br>
which affects the upset during the deceleration of the direct drive or inertia friction weld<br>
cycle. In the present disclosure, a pair of sample parts is welded to achieve a profile that<br>
represents the relationship between spindle speed and upset formation during the<br>
deceleration phase of the weld cycle. This stored profile data can thereafter be used as a<br>
basis for modulating torque applied during subsequent production weld cycles so that the<br>
upset is controlled during the deceleration of the spindle. The method can be carried out<br>
by any suitable welding system.<br>
Additional features of the present disclosure will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrative<br>
embodiments of the disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the present disclosure may be susceptible to embodiment in different<br>
forms, there is shown in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail,<br>
embodiments with the understanding that the present description is to be considered an<br>
exemplification of the principles of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the<br>
disclosure to the details of construction and the number and arrangements of components<br>
set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a weld system 10 in the form of a friction welder 12. The friction<br>
welder 12 includes a headstock portion 14 and a tailstock portion 16 wherein the<br>
headstock portion 14 includes a spindle 18 having a rotating chuck 20 for engaging a<br>
first part or component 22. A drive 24 such as a motor is configured to apply a torque to<br>
the spindle 18 to rotate the spindle via commands from a motion controller 26 (Fig. 2).<br>
The spindle 18 may be equipped with additional mass, such as a flywheel, to increase the<br>
moment of inertia of the rotating spindle.<br>
The tailstock portion 16 includes a non-rotating chuck 28 for engaging a second<br>
pan or component 30. The tailstock portion 16 mounts to a slide 32 wherein a slide<br>
actuator 34 slides the non-rotating chuck 28 toward the rotating chuck 20. Since the<br>
rotating chuck 20 and the non-rotating chuck 28 engage the first part 22 and the second<br>
part 30, respectively, the first part 22 and the second part 30 contact each other din-inn<br>
the weld cycle as will be discussed.<br>
Turning to Fig. 2, the weld system 10 is shown in schematic form further<br>
comprising the drive 24, a slide actuator 34, a central processing unit (CPU) 36, the<br>
motion controller 26, a slide encoder 38, a speed measurer 40, and a logic controller 42.<br>
The CPU 36 provides an interface to the operator to allow weld parameier entry and<br>
storage of weld parameters and communicates the weld parameters to the logic controller<br>
42. The CPU 36 also reads weld data from the logic controller 42, provides an interface1<br>
to display the weld data to the operator, and stores the weld data. The drive 24 applies<br>
torque to rotationally accelerate, decelerate, or maintain the rotational speed of tlu:<br>
spindle 18 (Fig. 1). The slide encoder 38 measures and signals the linear position of the<br>
slide 32 to the motion controller 26 wherein the motion controller 2o represent1; the<br>
intelligence that accepts commands related to slide position from the logic controller -12<br>
and translates those commands into commands issued to the slide actuator .14 which<br>
moves the slide 32. The slide actuator 34 may comprise a hydraulic cylinder, although,<br>
any device capable of providing an axial force could be used.<br>
The speed measurer 40 measures and signals the rotational speed of the spindle<br>
IS to the motion controller 26, wherein the motion controller 26 represents the<br>
intelligence that accepts commands related to spindle speed from the logic com roller -\.'<br>
and translates those commands into commands issued to the drive 24. "I lie muiion<br>
controller 26 has the ability to monitor the spindle speed information supplied by tin.-<br>
speed measurer 40 and adjust the torque output of the drive 24 in real time. The lookcontroller<br>
42 controls the functions and sequences of the weld system 10 and the friction<br>
welder 12 according to the weld parameters supplied by the operator via the CPU 36.<br>
The source code for the CPU 36 and the logic controller 42 may bo written in unv<br>
suitable manner.<br>
The CPU 36 operatively connects to the logic controller 42 which is operative!}1<br>
connected to the motion controller 26. The motion controller 26 operatively connects to<br>
the drive 24 to command the drive 24 to rotate the spindle 18. The motion controller 26<br>
also operatively connects to the slide actuator 34 to move the slide 32, wherein the sliik<br>
encoder 38 measures the linear position of the slide 32 as it moves during (.lit- Ibrmaikm<br>
of the weld at set time intervals while the speed measurer 40 measures the speed of the<br>
spindle 18. Accordingly, the slide encoder 38 and speed measurer 40 are operatively<br>
connected to the motion controller 26 such that the motion controller 26 analyzes Hitspindle<br>
angular velocity and slide position during different inertia weld phases such as ;m<br>
acceleration phase, a disengaged phase, a thrust phase and a deceleration phase, and<br>
during different direct drive weld phases such as acceleration phase, a first friction phase,<br>
a second friction phase, a braking phase, and a forge phase.<br>
As known in the art, the spindle drive torque command and spindle drive torque<br>
may be essentially identical in a correctly functioning machine since drive torque would<br>
be slightly delayed beyond the resolution of the time base. Additionally, pressure is<br>
directly related to the axial force applied to bring the two meeting faces of the<br>
components under load, since pressure is proportional to force in a hydraulic cylinder<br>
Further, upset caused during formation of a weld equals the reduction of lengths of tin.<br>
component parts as the component parts are friction welded together. Upset /.cix<br>
position may be the position of the slide under maximum weld load where the two<br>
Turning to Fig. 4 and referring to Fig. 3, a flowchart illustrates steps of the direct<br>
drive sample cycle 46 for the formation of the direct drive sample weld 44. As<br>
illustrated, the operator first inputs weld parameters that define the direct drive sample<br>
cycle 46. The operator then loads the pair of sample parts 22, 30 by engaging the first<br>
sample part 22 with the rotating chuck 20 connected to the spindle 18 while engaging the<br>
second sample part 30 with the non-rotating chuck 28. The operator then issues the start<br>
command 48 to initiate the direct drive sample cycle 46. Next the spindle 1 8 rotational ly<br>
accelerates to the friction speed 56 which is maintained as a constant speed.<br>
The motion controller 26 then commands the slide actuator 34 to move the slide<br>
32 to contact the opposed meeting faces of the two sample parts 22, 30 wherein die<br>
sample parts 22, 30 have a combined initial length 104 when sample part 30 contacts<br>
sample part 22. Upon contact, the motion controller 26 and the slide encoder 38<br>
establish the upset zero position 60. Once the first friction phase 64 is complete, the<br>
weld system 10 begins to apply the increased pressure 70 to initiate the second friction<br>
phase 72. At the end of the second friction phase 72, the braking phase SO of the direct<br>
drive sample cycle 46 initiates to rotationally decelerate the spindle 18 to zero velocity<br>
84.<br>
During the braking phase 80 of the direct drive sample weld cycle 46, the upset<br>
88 formation is not controlled. When the spindle 18 achieves zero velocity 84 at the end<br>
of the braking phase 80, the forge cooling dwell period 98 initiates in which the upset XS<br>
may continue to increase. At the end of the forged cooling dwell period l)8, the total<br>
upset 102 of the direct drive sample weld cycle ,46 can be calculated based on the<br>
difference between the upset zero position 60 and the upset final position 100. The<br>
formation of the direct drive sample weld 44 causes the upset to form which reduces the<br>
combined initial length 104 of the sample part 22, 30 to a welded final length J 06.<br>
meeting faces of the components are in contact with each other with zero iipst:i<br>
formation. Upset deceleration position may be the position of the slide when the weld<br>
system initiates the deceleration phase of the friction welding cycle. Upset position may<br>
be the position of the slide when the spindle achieves zero velocity after the deceleration<br>
phase of the friction welding cycle. Upset final position may be the position of the slnK<br>
under maximum weld load where the parts are welded together with I ma I upsei<br>
formation, wherein the final upset equals the displacement of the slide caused by the<br>
upset formed by the welding process. Length as used herein, is intended to mean. Tor<br>
example, the length of the parts as measured along the direction of slide movement a nd<br>
thus the direction of force applied to the component parts. Additionally, although the<br>
term in physics for spindle rotation is spindle angular velocity; the term, spindle speed, is<br>
typically used as standard terminology for friction weld parameters.<br>
Referring to Fig 3, the formation of a direct drive sample weld 44 is shown<br>
graphically, wherein the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents<br>
various measured values and -system commands during formation of tin; direct dnvi.-<br>
sample weld 44. To form the direct drive sample weld 44, the operator first inputs wdd<br>
parameters that define a direct drive sample cycle 46. The operator then loads the pair of<br>
sample parts 22, 30 (Fig. 1) by engaging the first sample part 22 with the rotating chuck<br>
20 (Fig. 1) connected to the spindle 18 (Fig. 1) and the second sample part 30 with the<br>
non-rotating chuck 28 (Fig. 1) connected to the slide 32 (Fig. 1). The operator then<br>
issues a start command 48 to initiate the direct drive sample cycle 46.<br>
The motion controller 26 (Fig. 2) issues a torque command 50 to the drive 2-(Fig. 2) to begin rotationally accelerating the spindle IS, wherein trace "A" in Fit', .-&gt;<br>
represents torque applied by the drive 24 to the spindle 18. The spindle 18, i n i t i a l l y ai<br>
rest, begins an initial rotation 52 during an acceleration phase, wherein trace "B" in Fig.<br>
3 represents the speed of the spindle 18 during formation of the direct drive sample weld<br>
44. The torque command 50 applied to the spindle 1 8 drops to a lower level 54 when a<br>
predetermined liielion speed 56 is attained by the spindle IS. Since the spimlle I X iunder<br>
closed loop velocity control via the motion controller 26, the torque required to<br>
maintain constant speed may fluctuate. Once this friction speed 56 is attained, the<br>
motion controller 26 commands the slide actuator 34 (Fig. 2) to move the slide 32 to<br>
contact the opposed meeting faces of the two sample parts 22, 30. This movement is<br>
illustrated in the upset trace 58 as the slide 32 moves the meeting faces of the two sample<br>
parts 22, 30 together, wherein trace "C" in Fig. 3 represents the upset formed during llindirect<br>
drive sample cycle 46. At initial contact of the meeting faces of the sample parts<br>
22, 30, the motion controller 26 and the slide encoder 38 (Fig. 2) establish an upset zero<br>
position 60.<br>
Following initial contact of the sample parts 22, 30, pressure buildt lo <i him></i>
friction pressure 62 during a first friction phase 64 wherein trace "D" in Fig, 3 represents<br>
pressure between the sample parts 22, 30. The friction due to the contact of the sample<br>
parts 22, 30 puts an additional torque 66" on the spindle 18. The spindle IS, however,<br>
remains under closed loop velocity control via the motion controller 26. As such, the<br>
motion controller 26 commands the drive 24 to respond to this additional torque 66 to<br>
maintain constant speed 68 of the spindle 18. The drive torque required to maintain the<br>
constant speed 68 typically decreases as the temperature at the weld interface between<br>
the sample parts 22, 30 increases. During the first friction phase 64, the weld system ID<br>
maintains the first friction pressure 62.<br>
Once a predetermined time ["first friction time"] is complete, the weld system I d<br>
begins to apply an increased pressure 70, which completes the first friction phase 64 and<br>
starts the second friction phase 72 of the direct drive sample cycle 46. The second<br>
the direct drive sample weld 44, e.g. metallurgy of materials, geometry, etc. Upon<br>
completion of the braking phase 80 at zero velocity 84, the formation of upset 88 may<br>
continue. An upset position 90 is determined after the spindle 18 achieves zero velocity<br>
84. At the end of the braking phase 80, a deceleration upset 92 may be calculated based<br>
on the difference between the upset deceleration position 82 and the upset position 90.<br>
This deceleration upset 92 represents the displacement of the slide 32 and the reduction<br>
of lengths of the sample parts 22, 30 caused by the formation of upset 88 during the<br>
braking phase 80.<br>
The end of the second friction phase 72 signals the transition into a forge phase<br>
94 wherein pressure increases to a forge pressure 96 from the second friction pressure<br>
74. The forge phase 94 may start immediately at the end of second friction phase 72.<br>
Alternatively, the forge phase 94 may be delayed after the second friction phase 72 and<br>
start after a predetermined forge delay time (not shown), or at a given spindle velocity,<br>
i.e. a forge speed (not shown), or at zero velocity 84 of the spindle 18 (not shown).<br>
Once the braking phase 80 ends at zero velocity 84 of the spindle 18, a forge<br>
cooling dwell period 98 initiates in which forge pressure 96 is maintained for a<br>
predetermined period of time. During the forge cooling dwell period 98, the upset 88<br>
may continue to increase. An upset final position 100 is determined after the slide 32<br>
movement toward the spindle 18 ceases. At the end of the forge cooling dwell period 98<br>
when the slide 32 reaches a rest position, a total upset 102 of the direct drive sample<br>
weld 44 may be calculated based on the difference between the upset zero position 60<br>
and the upset final position 100. As such, the total upset 102 represents the displacement<br>
of the slide 32 and the reduction of lengths of the sample parts 22, 30 caused by Ihc<br>
formation of the upset during the direct drive sample cycle 46.<br>
friction phase 72 of the cycle is characterized by application of an increased second<br>
friction pressure 74. The combination of the first friction phase 64 and the second<br>
friction phase 72, comprises the friction phase of the direct drive sample cycle 46. Ai<br>
some point in the friction phase, the energy input generates enough heat for the specific<br>
material and geometry of the sample parts 22, 30 to plasticize sufficient material which<br>
allows upsetting 76 to occur as represented by trace "C" in Fig. 3.<br>
The end 78 of second friction phase 72 is triggered by time ["friction time"] in a<br>
friction-to-time weld cycle, or upset ["friction distance"] in a friction-to-distance weld<br>
cycle, or slide position ["friction limit position"] in a friction-to-finished-length wold<br>
cycle, the friction-to-time weld cycle, the friction-to-distance weld cycle and the frictionto-<br>
finished-length weld cycle being common friction weld cycle variations. At the end<br>
of the second friction phase 72, a braking phase 80 of the direct drive sample cycle 4 f i<br>
initiates wherein the braking phase 80 may be executed by different procedures. Upmi<br>
initiation of the braking phase 80, an upset deceleration position 82 is determined. In an<br>
embodiment, the spindle 18 may be maintained in a velocity loop, and a velocity<br>
controlled deceleration via the motion controller 26 to zero velocity can occur within a<br>
specified time [not shown]. Alternatively, the drive 24 may rotationally decelerate the<br>
spindle 18 to rest, or zero velocity 84, in torque mode by applying a brake torque 86 to<br>
the spindle 18, The brake torque 86 can optionally be delayed by applying zero motor<br>
torque prior to applying the brake torque 86, wherein this zero torque delay period is still<br>
included in the braking phase 80. The brake torque 86 may also be applied after u<br>
predetermined time, i.e. a brake delay time (not shown), or at a given speed, i.e. a<br>
braking speed (not shown). The braking phase 80 ends at zero velocity 84 of the spindle<br>
18. In the formation of the direct drive sample weld 44, the formation of upset 88 is not<br>
controlled during the braking phase 80 and is influenced by the natural characteristics of<br>
While executing the direct drive sample weld 44, the weld system 10 acquires<br>
weld data 108 that can be used to characterize the rotational deceleration of the spindle<br>
18 and the axial movement of the slide 32, and thus the upset 88, during the braking<br>
phase 80 of the direct drive sample cycle 46 for the specific parts to be welded in<br>
subsequent production welds. The upset 88 that forms during the braking phase 80 of<br>
this direct drive sample weld 44 is subject to some inherent and unpredictable variations.<br>
However, weld data 108 acquired during the formation of the direct drive sample weld<br>
44 can be analyzed to determine the upset 88 and the speed of the spindle 18 at various<br>
instants in time from the end 78 of friction phase to zero velocity 84 of the spindle 18,<br>
i.e., during the braking phase 80.<br>
During the formation of the direct drive sample weld 44, the weld system 10<br>
measures and stores weld data 108 at specific time intervals. The weld data 108 serve as<br>
a basis for calculating the upset versus spindle velocity profile as will be discussed. The<br>
weld data 108 are typically measured during the entire weld cycle, but the measurements<br>
are particularly critical during the braking phase 80 of the direct drive sample cycle 46.<br>
Additionally, thrust pressure may also be measured and stored with the weld data 108.<br>
During the formation of the sample weld 44, the weld data 108 are acquired and<br>
temporarily stored by the logic controller 42.<br>
When the direct drive sample cycle 46 is complete, the CPU 36-reads the weld<br>
data 108 from the logic controller 42, displays the results to the operator, and stores a<br>
complete record of the weld data 108, The weld data 108 measured and stored can be in<br>
any suitable form that can then be used to form subsequent production welds requiring<br>
the same characteristic upset versus spindle velocity profile as was measured during the<br>
braking phase 80 of the sample direct drive weld cycle 46, In the illustrated flowchart,<br>
the weld data 108 are used to calculate a profile 110. The weld data 108 include the<br>
speed of the spindle 18 as a function of time which may be represented as two discrete<br>
arrays, one array of spindle speeds and an associated array of time values at which the<br>
spindle speed was measured. The weld data 108 used in the calculation of the profile 110<br>
further include the position of the slide 32 as a function of time represented as two<br>
discrete arrays, one array of slide positions and an associated array of time values at<br>
which the slide position was measured. The weld data 108 also include the upset zero<br>
position 60 so that upset can be calculated from the slide position data.<br>
The weld data 108 are compiled into the profile 110, wherein the profile 110 is a<br>
calculated model of the relationship of the characteristic formation of the upset 88 versus<br>
the speed of the spindle 18 during the braking phase 80 of the sample direct drive sample<br>
cycle 46. The profile 110 then serves as a basis for controlling subsequent production<br>
welds in order to match the displacement of the sample part 30 caused by the upset 88 at<br>
any given spindle velocity during the braking phase 80 and, thus, eliminate the inhereiil<br>
upset variation during the braking phase 80 in a production direct drive weld to produce<br>
either consistent reduction of lengths or consistent final product lengths as will be<br>
discussed.<br>
In the present disclosure, the profile 110 is represented by a lookup table that<br>
provides upset 88 formation as a function of spindle speed. In other words, the profile<br>
110 is an array in which the indices of the array are a factor of speed and the values<br>
stored in the array represent the upset 88 that was measured at the corresponding spindle<br>
speed. Thus, at any given speed, the corresponding upset setpoint can be looked up for<br>
that speed. An index is calculated by multiplying the floating point representation of<br>
current speed and a floating point representation of a spindle-speed-to-indcx scaling<br>
factor, and rounding the result to produce an integer index. Since the weld data 108 arc<br>
acquired through digital acquisition rates, the weld data 108 must be interpolated to till<br>
in spindle velocity points where no actual data sample was measured to achieve a<br>
complete array for the profile 110.<br>
After the CPU 36 calculates the profile 110 from the weld data 108 of the direct<br>
drive sample weld 44, the welded component is removed in order to execute any number<br>
of subsequent direct drive production welds as will be discussed.<br>
Turning to Fig. 5 and referring to Fig. 4, the formation of a direct drive<br>
production weld 112 is shown graphically, wherein the horizontal axis represents time<br>
and the vertical axis represents various measured values and system commands during<br>
formation of the direct drive production weld 112, in accordance with an embodiment of<br>
the present disclosure. To form the direct drive production weld 112, the operator first<br>
inputs weld parameters that define a direct drive production weld cycle 114. The<br>
operator then loads the pair of production parts 116, 118 (Fig. 1) by engaging the first<br>
production part 116 with the rotating chuck 20 (Fig. 1) while engaging the second<br>
production part 118 with the non-rotating chuck 28 (Fig. 1). Additionally, a profile 110<br>
(Fig. 4) is then selected. Any number of direct drive sample welds 44 (Fig. 3 and 4) may<br>
be executed, and the weld data 108 (Fig. 4) from these direct drive sample welds 44 may<br>
be compiled into various sample profiles 110 and stored on the CPU 36 (Fig. 2). The<br>
profile 110 that is most suitable for the current configuration of production parts 116,<br>
118 is selected from the list of available profiles 110. The direct drive production welds<br>
102 may be either torque modulated upset controlled direct drive welds or torque<br>
modulated final part length controlled direct drive welds.<br>
The cycle characteristics of a direct drive production cycle 114 are identical with<br>
the characteristics of the direct drive sample cycle 46 through the end of the second<br>
friction phase 72 or the beginning of braking phase 80, wherein Fig. 5 illustrates the<br>
same reference numerals as Fig. 3 for common values and system commands. Any<br>
parameter that affects the deceleration rate of the spindle 18 is unchangeable in the direct<br>
drive production weld 112, and is duplicated from the selected direct drive sample weld<br>
44. These parameters include friction speed, brake torque, brake speed, brake dclny<br>
time, forge pressure, forge speed, and forge delay time. If these parameters need to be<br>
changed, a new direct drive sample weld 44 and corresponding profile 110 must be<br>
processed and stored. The CPU 36 calculates any additional required parameters based<br>
on the parameters input by the operator and the characteristics of the sample profile 110<br>
selected. All of the parameters, including the profile 110 array of upset versus speed are<br>
communicated to the logic controller 42 from the CPU 36.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the weld system 10 begins friction welding together the pair<br>
of production parts 116, 118 to form the direct drive production weld 112, After weld<br>
parameters are input by the operator and the first production part 116 and the other<br>
production part 118 are engaged, the operator then issues a start command 120 for the<br>
direct drive production cycle 114. After the spindle is accelerated to friction speed 56,<br>
the motion controller 26 commands the slide actuator 34 to move the slide 32 to contact<br>
the opposed meeting faces of .the two production parts 116, 118 wherein the production<br>
parts 116, 118 have a combined initial length 122 when production part 118 contacts<br>
production part 116. The direct drive production cycle 114 proceeds as described above<br>
in the direct drive sample cycle 46. If the objective of the direct drive production cycle<br>
114 is final upset control, the braking phase 80 initiates when a friction upset distance<br>
124 is achieved. If the objective of the direct drive production cycle 114 is final product<br>
length control, the braking phase 80 initiates when the friction limit position 126 is<br>
achieved.<br>
During the braking phase 80 of the direct drive production weld cycle 114, the<br>
motion controller 26 compares actual upset 128 formation to the upset setpoint dictated<br>
by the profile 110 for the current actual speed of the spindle 18 to generate an upset error<br>
signal 130 as shown in the flowchart of Fig. 4. In the present disclosure, the current<br>
upset setpoint at any instant in time can be looked up from the profile 110 based on the<br>
current speed of the spindle 18. The current actual upset 128 can be subtracted from the<br>
current upset setpoint to generate the upset error signal 130. Thus, returning to Fig. 5,<br>
during the braking phase 80 of the direct drive production cycle 114, the drive 24<br>
modulates torque 132 applied to the spindle 18 so that the upset 128 at any given spindle<br>
speed during the formation of the direct drive production weld 112 is formed in<br>
accordance with the profile 110 measured during the formation of the direct drive sample<br>
weld 44 to produce upset 128 consistent with the upset 88 formed during the braking<br>
phase 80 of the direct drive sample weld 44.<br>
The upset error signal 130 from either the upset controlled direct drive weld or<br>
the final part length controlled direct drive weld is used to modulate torque 132 applied<br>
to the spindle 18 during the braking phase 80. If the actual upset 128 forming in the<br>
direct drive production cycle 114 is less than upset setpoint in the profile 110 at any<br>
given speed, the drive 24 applies positive torque 132 to the spindle 18. IT the actual<br>
upset 128 forming in the direct drive production cycle 114 is greater than the upset<br>
setpoint in the profile 110 at any given speed, the drive 24 applies negative or braking<br>
torque 132 to the spindle 18. Accordingly, during the braking phase 80, the modulated<br>
torque 132 compensates for the upset error signal 130 to form the upset 128 in<br>
accordance with the profile 110. As such, the modulated torque 132 continuously<br>
increases or decreases the deceleration of the spindle 18 during the braking phase 80 to<br>
consistently form the upset 128 in accordance with the fonnation of upset 88 of the direct:<br>
drive sample weld 54.<br>
The upset error signal 130 is driven into a PID algorithm (Proportion -<br>
Integral - Derivative) producing the modulated torque signal 132 that is issued to the<br>
drive 24 to compensate for the upset error signal 130. As such, the modulated torque<br>
132 applied to spindle 18 during the formation of the direct drive production weld 112<br>
causes the upset at any given spindle speed to form in accordance with the profile 11.0 so<br>
that the upset 128 experienced during the formation of the direct drive production weld<br>
112 is consistent with the upset 88 experienced during the formation of the direct drive<br>
sample weld 44. Still further, the modulated torque 132 applied to spindle 18 during Ihc<br>
formation of the direct drive production weld 112 causes the displacement of the slide T&gt;<br>
caused by the upset 128 to match the displacement of the slide 32 experienced during the<br>
formation of the direct drive sample weld 44,<br>
In an embodiment for controlling the final part length, the profile 110<br>
calculated from the direct drive sample cycle 46 is further used to control the final length<br>
134 for the welded production part. Since the modulated torque 132 forms the upset 128<br>
following the onset of the deceleration phase 72 in accordance with the profile 110, the<br>
deceleration can be initiated so that the total upset 92 reduces the combined initial length<br>
122 to the specified final welded part length 134. In this embodiment, after providing<br>
the production parts 116, 1 IS and before rotationally accelerating production part 116 the<br>
operator specifies the dimension 136 for the final length 134 of the welded production<br>
part. The weld system men controls initiation of the rotational deceleration of<br>
production part 116, i.e. the braking phase 80. As such, the torque modulation applied to<br>
the production part 116 is controlled so that the sum of the upset 76 formed prior to the<br>
braking phase 80 and the upset 128 formed during and after the braking phase 80 reduces<br>
the final length 134 to the desired dimension 136. In an embodiment, the initial lengths<br>
104, 106 and final lengths 122, 124 of the sample parts 22, 30 and production parts 116,<br>
118 may represent initial and final axial lengths of the sample parts 22, 30 and<br>
production parts 116, 118.<br>
In the present disclosure, the closed loop control algorithm for generating the<br>
modulated torque command 132 signal based on the current upset error signal 130 is<br>
implemented in a standard digital independent positional PID algorithm with derivative<br>
on error. Alternatively, the closed loop control algorithm could be implemented in any<br>
suitable algorithm including, but not limited to, a dependent algorithm or a velocity<br>
algorithm. The algorithms may be implemented in the logic controller 42 in any suitable<br>
manner. The direct drive production cycle 114 described for the formation of the direci<br>
drive production weld 112 may be subsequently repeated to weld together on a volume<br>
basis any number of additional production parts 116, 118.<br>
Referring to Fig 6, the formation of an inertia sample weld 138 is shown<br>
graphically, wherein the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents<br>
various measured values and system commands during formation of the iueiiia sample<br>
weld 138, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. To form the<br>
inertia sample weld 138, the operator first inputs weld parameters that define an inertia<br>
sample cycle 140. The operator then loads the pair of sample parts 22, 30 (Fig. 1) by<br>
engaging the first sample part 22 with the rotating chuck 20 (Fig. 1) connected to the<br>
spindle 18 (Fig. 1), while engaging the second sample part 30 with the non-rotating<br>
chuck 28 (Fig. 1). The operator then issues a start command 142 to initiate the inertia<br>
sample cycle 140.<br>
The motion controller 26 (Fig. 2) issues a torque command 144 to the drive 24 to<br>
begin rotationally accelerating the spindle 18, wherein trace "A" in Fig. 6 represents flu;<br>
torque applied by the drive 24. The spindle 18, initially at rest, begins an initial rotation<br>
146 during an acceleration phase, wherein trace "B" in Fig. 6 represents the speed of the<br>
spindle 18 during formation of the inertia sample weld 138. The torque command 14-1<br>
applied to the spindle 18 drops to zero 148 when a predetermined disengage speed 150 is<br>
attained. During this disengage phase, the spindle 18 rotates free from any influence<br>
from the drive 24. The spindle 18 rotationally decelerates at a rate dependent on the<br>
inertia and frictional losses inherent in the weld system 10. Once the spindle IS<br>
rotationally decelerates naturally to a preset weld speed 151, the motion controller 26<br>
commands the slide actuator 34 (Fig. 2) to move the slide 32 (Fig. 2) to contact the<br>
opposed meeting faces of the two sample parts 22, 30. This is illustrated in initial upset<br>
trace 154 as the slide 32 moves the meeting faces of the two sample parts 22, 30<br>
together, wherein trace "C" in Fig. 6 represents the upset formed during the inertia<br>
sample cycle 140. At initial contact of the meeting faces of the sample parts 22, 30 the<br>
motion controller 26 and the slide encoder 38 (Fig. 2) establish an upset zero position<br>
156.<br>
During the contact of the sample parts 22, 30, pressure builds to weld pressure<br>
158 wherein trace "D" in Fig. 6 represents the pressure between the sample parts 22, 30.<br>
Also at this time, the drive 24 may apply zero torque 152 to the spindle 18 during a llinist<br>
phase. Alternatively, the drive 24 may apply a positive 160 or negative torque 162 at<br>
this time and thus increase or decrease the energy to be dissipated into the inertia sample<br>
weld 138, respectively. In inertia welding, a base input energy for any given material<br>
and geometry must generate enough heat to plasticize sufficient material to allow the<br>
upset 176 to form. Optionally, at a predetermined "upset speed", the weld system 10,<br>
can increase the axial load on the two sample parts 22, 30 to an "upset pressure" (uoi<br>
shown).<br>
The contact of the meeting faces of the sample parts 22, 30 puts a torque load on<br>
the spindle 18 due to the frictional weld torque between the two sample parts 22, 30<br>
during a deceleration phase 164 of the inertia sample cycle 140. This contact causes a<br>
deceleration 178 of the spindle 18 to eventually reach a zero velocity 166. At zero<br>
velocity 166, the formation of upset 168 may continue. An upset position 170 is<br>
determined after the spindle achieves zero velocity 166. A deceleration upset 172 may<br>
be calculated based on the difference between upset zero position 156 and the upset<br>
position 170. This deceleration upset 172 represents the displacement of the slide 32 and<br>
the reduction at length of the sample parts 22, 30 caused by the formation of upset 168<br>
during the deceleration phase 164.<br>
In the formation of the inertia sample weld 138, the upset 168 formed during the<br>
part contact deceleration 164 phase is not controlled and is influenced by the natural<br>
characteristics of the weld, e.g. metallurgy of materials, geometry, etc. Once the spindle<br>
18 achieves zero velocity 166, the drive 24 commands zero torque 163 to the spindle 18.<br>
At zero velocity 166, a cooling dwell period 180 is initiated where weld (or upset)<br>
pressure 158 is maintained for a predetermined period of time. During the cooling dwell<br>
period 180, the upset 168 may continue to increase. A final upset position 182 is<br>
determined after the slide 32 movement toward the spindle 18 ceases. At the end of the<br>
cooling dwell period 180, when the slide 32 reaches a rest position, a total upset 184 of<br>
the inertia sample weld 138 can be calculated based on the difference between the upset<br>
zero position 156 and the final upset position 182. As such, the total upset 184<br>
represents the displacement of the slide 32 and the reduction of lengths of the sample<br>
parts 22, 30 caused by the formation of the upset 168 during the inertia sample cycle<br>
140.<br>
Turning to Fig. 7 and referring to Fig. 6, a flowchart illustrates steps of the inertia<br>
sample cycle 140 for the formation of the inertia sample weld 138. As illustrated, the<br>
operator first inputs weld parameters that define the inertia sample cycle 140. The<br>
operator then loads the pair of sample parts 22, 30 by engaging the first sample part 22<br>
with the rotating chuck 20 connected to the spindle 18 while engaging the second sample<br>
part 30 with the non-rotating chuck 28. The operator men issues the starl command 142<br>
to initiate the inertia sample cycle 140.<br>
The spindle 18 then rotationally accelerates to the disengage speed 150 wherein<br>
the drive 24 then applies zero torque 152 to the spindle 18. The spindle 18 then<br>
rotationally decelerates naturally to the preset weld speed 151 wherein the motion<br>
controller 26 commands the slide actuator 34 to move the slide 32 to contact the oppose<br>
meeting faces of the two sample parts 22, 30 wherein the sample parts 22, 30 have a<br>
combined initial length 186 when sample part 30 contacts sample part 22. At initial<br>
contact of the meeting faces of sample part 22, 30 the motion controller 26 and the slide<br>
encoder 38 establish the upset zero position 156. The contact of the meeting laces of ilu:<br>
sample parts 22, 30 puts a torque load on the spindle 18 due to the frictional weld torque<br>
between the two sample parts 22, 30 during the part contact deceleration phase 164 of<br>
the inertia sample cycle 140. The contact causes the deceleration 178 of the spindle 18<br>
to eventually reach zero velocity 166. At the end of the cooling dwell period 180, the<br>
total upset 184 of the inertia sample cycle 140 can be calculated based on the difference<br>
between the upset zero position 156 and the final upset position 182. Accordingly, tlnj<br>
formation of the inertia sample weld 138 causes the upset to form while reducing the<br>
initial length 186 of the sample parts 22, 30 to a final length 188 of the welded sampleparts<br>
22, 30.<br>
While executing the inertia sample weld 138, the weld system 10 eathers weld<br>
data 190 that can be used to characterize the rotational deceleration of the spindle 18 and<br>
the axial movement of the slide 32, and thus, the upset 168, during the pail conlacl<br>
deceleration phase 164 of the inertia sample cycle 140 for the specific pails to be welded<br>
in subsequent production welds. The upset 168 that forms during the part contacl<br>
deceleration phase 164 of this sample inertia weld 126 is uncontrolled and therefore<br>
subject to some inherent and unpredictable variations. However, the weld data 190<br>
acquired during the inertia sample cycle 140 can be analyzed to determine the upset 168<br>
formed, the speed of the spindle 18 and movement of the slide 32 at various instants in<br>
time from the contact of the meeting faces of the sample parts 22, 30 to zero velocity 166<br>
of the spindle 18, i.e., the part contact deceleration phase 164.<br>
During the formation of the inertia sample weld 138, the weld system 10<br>
measures and stores the weld data 190 at specific time intervals. The weld data 190<br>
serve as a basis for calculating the upset versus spindle velocity profile as will be<br>
discussed. The weld data 190 are typically measured during the entire weld cycle, but<br>
the measurements are particularly critical during the part contact deceleration phase 164<br>
of the inertia sample weld 138. Additionally, thrust pressure may also be measured and<br>
stored with the weld data 190. During the formation of the inertia sample weld 138, the<br>
weld data 190 are acquired and temporarily stored by the logic controller 42.<br>
When the inertia sample cycle 140 is complete, the CPU 36 reads the weld data<br>
190 from the logic controller 42, displays the results to the operator, and stores a<br>
complete record of the weld data 190. The weld data 190 measured and stored can be in<br>
any suitable form that can then be used to form additional production welds requiring the<br>
same characteristic upset versus spindle velocity profile as was measured during the part<br>
contact deceleration phase 164 of the inertia friction sample weld 138. In the illustrated<br>
flowchart, the weld data 190 are used to calculate a profile 192. The weld data 190<br>
include the speed of the spindle 18 as a function of time which may be represented as<br>
two discrete arrays, one array of spindle speeds and an associated array of time values at<br>
which the spindle speed was measured. The weld data 190 used in the calculation of the<br>
profile 192 further include position of the slide 32 as a function of time represented as<br>
two discrete arrays, one array of slide positions and an associated array of time values ai<br>
which the slide position was measured. The weld data 190 also include the upset zero<br>
position 156 so that upset 168 can be calculated from the slide position data.<br>
The weld data 190 are compiled into the profile 192, wherein the profile 192 is a<br>
calculated model of the relationship of the characteristic formation of the upset 16.S<br>
versus speed of the spindle 18 during the part contact deceleration phase 164 of the<br>
inertia sample cycle 140. The profile 192 then serves as a basis for controlling<br>
subsequent production welds in order to match the displacement of the sample part 30<br>
caused by the upset 168 at any given spindle velocity during the part contact deceleration<br>
phase 164 and, thus, eliminate the inherent upset variation during the part contaci<br>
deceleration phase 164 in a production inertia weld to produce welded parts with a<br>
consistent reduction of lengths as will be discussed.<br>
In the present disclosure, the profile 192 is represented by a lookup table that<br>
provides upset 168 formation as a function of speed. In other words, the profile 192 is<br>
an array in which the indices of the array are a factor of speed and the values stored in<br>
the array represent the upset 168 that was measured at the corresponding .spindle speed.<br>
Thus, at any given speed, the corresponding upset setpoint can be looked up for that<br>
speed. An index is calculated by multiplying the floating point representation of current<br>
speed and a floating point representation of a spindle-speed-to-index scaling factor, and<br>
rounding the result to produce an integer index. Since the weld data 190 are acquired<br>
through digital acquisition rates, the weld data 190 must be interpolated to fill in spindle<br>
velocity points where no actual data sample was measured to achieve a complete array of<br>
the profile 192.<br>
After the CPU 36 calculates the profile 192 from the weld data 1 90 of the merlin<br>
sample weld 138, the welded component is removed in order to execute any number of<br>
subsequent inertia production welds as will be discussed.<br>
Turning to Fig. 8 and referring to Fig. 7, the formation of an inertia production<br>
weld 194 is shown graphically, wherein the horizontal axis represents time and the<br>
vertical axis represents various measured values and system commands during formation<br>
of the inertia production weld 194, in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure. To form the inertia production weld 194, the operator lirst inputs weld<br>
parameters that define an inertia production cycle 196. The operator then loads the pair<br>
of production parts 116, 118 (Fig. 1) by engaging the first production part 1 16 with I he<br>
rotating chuck 20 (Fig. 1) while engaging the second production part J 1 8 with the nonrotating<br>
chuck 28 (Fig. 1). Additionally, a profile 192 (Fig. 7) is then selected. Any<br>
number of inertia sample welds 138 (Fig. 6 and 7) may be executed, and the weld data<br>
190 from these inertia sample welds 138 may be compiled into various sample profiles<br>
192 and stored on the CPU 36 (Fig 2). The profile 192 mat is most suitable for the<br>
current configuration of production parts 116, 118 is selected from the list of available<br>
pro files 192.<br>
In inertia welding, a base input energy for any given material and geometry<br>
must generate enough heat to plasticize sufficient material to allow the upset 168 to<br>
form. Since upset 168 does not start for a period of time after initial contact bulween (lit:<br>
two production parts 116, 118, a parameter must be established to specify when to<br>
initiate torque modulation. This can be done in any suitable way, but the two ways<br>
illustrated in this disclosure are via a turn-on-speed parameter 198, or via a tiini-on-u|Wi:l<br>
parameter 200 as shown in Fig. 8. The tum-on-speed parameter 198 is a predetermined<br>
spindle velocity defined such that when the spindle speed drops below that specified<br>
value, torque modulation is initiated. The turn-on-upset parameter 200 is defined such<br>
that when the upset 168 increases above that specified value, torque modulation is<br>
initiated.<br>
The cycle characteristics of the inertia production cycle 196 are identical with the<br>
characteristics of the inertia sample cycle 140 through the acceleration phase and u n t i l<br>
the rurn-oa-speed or tuni-on-upset parameter 19S, 200 triggers the initiation of a torque<br>
modulation phase 202. Any parameter that affects the rotational deceleration rate of the<br>
spindle 18 is unchangeable in the inertia production welds 194, and must be duplicated<br>
from the inertia sample weld 138. These parameters include weld speed, brake torque,<br>
weld pressure, upset speed, and upset pressure. If these parameters need to he changed, a<br>
new inertia sample weld 138 and corresponding profile 192 must he processed and<br>
stored. The CPU 36 calculates any additional required parameters based on the<br>
parameters input by the operator above and the characteristics of the sample profile 192<br>
selected. All of the parameters, including the profile arrays of upset versus speed are<br>
communicated to the logic controller 42 from the CPU 36.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, the weld system 10 begins inertia friction welding together<br>
the pair of production parts 116, 118 to form the inertia production weld 194. After wold<br>
parameters are input by the operator and the first production part 116 and the second<br>
production part 118 are engaged, the operator then issues the start command 204 for the<br>
inertia production cycle 196. After the spindle is accelerated to disengage speed 150 and<br>
coasts naturally to weld speed 151, the motion controller 26 then commands the slide<br>
actuator 34 to move the slide 32 to contact the opposed meeting faces of the two<br>
production parts 116, 118 wherein the production parts 116, 118 have a combined initial<br>
length 206 when production part 118 contacts production part 116. The inertia<br>
production cycle 196 proceeds as described above in the inertia sample cycle 140. Since<br>
the weld is an upset controlled inertia weld, when the turn-on-speed parameter 198 or the<br>
rurn-on-upset parameter 200 is reached, the torque modulated phase 202 is initiated.<br>
During the torque modulated phase 202 of the inertia production cycle 196.<br>
the motion controller 26 compares actual upset 208 forming to the upsel setpoint: dictuled<br>
by the profile 192 for the current actual speed of the spindle 18 to generate an upset error<br>
signal 210 as shown in the flowchart of Fig. 7. In the present disclosure, the current<br>
upset setpoint at any instant in time can be looked up from the profile 192 array based on<br>
current spindle 18 speed. The current actual upset 208 can be subtracted from the currenl<br>
upset setpoint to generate the upset error signal 210.<br>
The upset error signal 210 is then used to modulate drive torque 212 applied to<br>
the spindle 18 during the torque modulated phase 202. Traces 214 and 216 show the<br>
modulated torque signal in the embodiment in which a non-zero brake torque was used<br>
in the selected profile 192 of the inertia sample weld 138. Trace 214 shows (he<br>
modulated torque signal biased around a positive brake torque, and trace 216 shows the<br>
modulated torque signal biased around a negative brake torque. If the actual upset 20S<br>
forming in the inertia production weld 194 is less than the upset setpoint in the profile<br>
192 at any given speed, the drive 24 applies positive torque to the spindle 18. If the<br>
upset 208 forming in the inertia production weld 194 is greater than the upset setpoint in<br>
the profile 192 at any given speed, the drive 24 applies negative torque to the spindle 1 8.<br>
Accordingly, during the torque modulated phase 202, the modulated torque 212 or (214,<br>
216) compensates for the upset error signal 210 to form the upset 208 in accordance with<br>
the profile 192. As such, the modulated torque continuously increases or decreases the<br>
deceleration of the spindle 18 during the torque modulated phase 202 to consistently<br>
form the upset 208 in accordance with the formation of upset 168 of the inertia sample<br>
weld 138. The upset error signal 210 is driven into a PID algorithm (Proportion -<br>
Integral - Derivative) producing the modulated torque signal 212 or (214, 216) 'thai, is<br>
issued to the spindle 18 to compensate for the upset error signal 210. As such, the<br>
modulated torque 212 or (214, 216) applied to spindle 18 during the formation of the<br>
inertia production weld 194 causes the upset 208 at any given spindle speed to form in<br>
accordance with the profile 192 so that the upset 208 caused during the formation of the<br>
inertia production weld 194 is consistent with the upset 168 caused during the formation<br>
of the inertia sample weld 138.<br>
In the present disclosure, the closed loop control algorithm for generating the<br>
modulated torque command signal based on the current upset error signal 210 is<br>
implemented in a standard digital independent positional PID algorithm with derivative<br>
on error. Alternatively, the closed loop control algorithm could be implemented in any<br>
suitable algorithm including, but not limited to, a dependent algorithm or a velocity<br>
algorithm. The algorithms may be implemented in the logic controller 42 in any suitable<br>
manner. The inertia production cycle 196 described for the formation of the inertia<br>
production weld 194 may be subsequently repeated to weld together on a volume basis<br>
any number of additional production parts 116, 118.<br>
Thus, during the inertia production cycle 196, and in particular, I lie torque<br>
modulated phase 202, the drive 24 modulates the torque commands 212 or (214, 2 1 6 )<br>
applied to the spindle 18 so that the upset 208 that occurs in the torque modulated phase<br>
202 of the inertia production weld cycle 196 forms in accordance with the upset 168 that<br>
occurred in the part contact deceleration phase 164 of the selected inertia sample weld<br>
cycle 140, significantly reducing the variability in upset for the inertia production welds.<br>
Turning to Fig. 9, in order to illustrate the present disclosure, an example of:<br>
upset setpoint, torque command response, spindle angular velocity response, and<br>
resultant upset response versus time, is shown. The example shows a typical spindle<br>
rotational deceleration that could be the result of an inertia torque modulated<br>
deceleration. The principles of this example could also be applied to a direct drive<br>
torque modulated deceleration, as will become readily apparent from the following<br>
discussion.<br>
Once the speed of the spindle IS (Fig. 2) falls below the tum-on-speed parameter<br>
218, or the upset 220 increases above the turn-on-upset parameter 222, the motion<br>
controller 26 (Fig. 2) begins modulating the torque applied to the spindle 18. Initially,<br>
the upset setpoint 224 is much higher then actual upset 226 which creates a positive<br>
upset error that is driven into the PID loop, This causes the torque command output to<br>
the drive 24 to start to rise in order to attempt lo compensate for the upset error<br>
calculated as upset setpoint 224 minus actual upset 226. The increased torque command<br>
228 causes a corresponding decrease in the deceleration 230 of the spindle 18. This<br>
decrease in the deceleration 230 of the spindle 18 reduces the rate of increase ofrlie upsci<br>
setpoint 232 since upset setpoint is a function of speed.<br>
The upset error generated at this point in time begins to decrease as the actual<br>
upset 226 begins its approach to the upset setpoint 232. The terms of the properly tuned<br>
PID loop balance out, as the upset error approaches zero. The integrator contribution<br>
from the PID loop holds the torque command 234 steady, since the upset error is near<br>
zero and the upset selpoint 232 is approximately equal to the actual upset 236. This near<br>
constant torque command 234 causes the speed of the spindle 18 to continue to<br>
rotationally decelerate in a smooth manner 238. Once the speed of the spindle 18<br>
reaches zero speed 240, the torque modulation is disabled 242. After the cooling dwell<br>
period is complete, linal upset 244 of the production weld 246 essentially duplicates ihe<br>
final upset (not shown) dictated by the sample weld (not shown).<br>
Accordingly, the present disclosure in accordance with one embodiment provides<br>
a method of friction welding pairs of production parts. The method includes providing a<br>
pair of sample parts having a combined initial axial or other length; applying lorquc l <br>
one of the sample parts to rotationally accelerate the one sample part; moving the other<br>
sample part toward the one sample part to contact the one sample part; friction welding<br>
together the pair of sample parts causing rotational deceleration of the one sample part,<br>
further movement of the other sample part toward the one sample part, and the formation<br>
of a sample weld causing upset thereby reducing the combined length of the pair of<br>
sample parts from the combined initial length to a final welded length; acquiring data<br>
related to the rotational deceleration of the one sample part and the movement of the<br>
other sample part during the formation of the sample weld; calculating a profile from the<br>
acquired data; providing a pair of production parts having a combined initial length of<br>
parts; applying torque to one of the production parts to rotationally accclcnik: Ilic one<br>
production part; moving the other production part toward the one production part to<br>

parts so that the upset formation at any give spindle speed is formed in accordance with<br>
the profile so that the upset caused during the formation of the production weld is<br>
consistent with the upset caused during the formation of the sample weld. The compiling<br>
of the data and the calculating of the profile may be the result of welding more than one,<br>
and perhaps many, pairs of sample parts before the profile is employed for use in<br>
production. The disclosure also provides a friction weld system including one or more of<br>
the features described above.<br>
