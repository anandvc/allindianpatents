PROCESS FOR OXIDISING AN AROMATIC ALDEHYDE TO THE CORRESPONDING CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
The present invention relates to a process for oxidising an aromatic aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a process for oxidising vanillin to p-vaniUic acid or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzoic acid.<br>
European patent EP-A-0 773 919 describes the preparation of vaniUin or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde using a process consisting of reacting formol and guaiacol in the presence of sodium hydroxide to produce a mixture comprising o-hydroxymethylguaiacol (OMG), p-hydroxymethylguaiacol (PMG), 4,6-di(hydroxymethyl)guaiacol (DMG) then oxidising said mixture with oxygen in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a bismuth co-catalyst and then eliminating the carboxylic group located in the ortho position from the oxidation products containing it to obtain vanillin in a very good reaction yield.<br>
At the end of the oxidation step, the following quantities of products are obtained:<br>
•	ortho series:<br>
•	RR o-vanillin (OVA)	= 1%<br>
•	RR o-vanillic acid (AOV)	= 14%<br>
•	para series:<br>
•	RR vanillin (PVA)	- 16%<br>
•	RR p-vaniUic acid (APV)	= 1%<br>
•	di- series:<br>
•	RR o-carboxyvanillin (OCVA)	- 47%<br>
•	RR 4,6-(dicarboxy)guaiacol (DCG)   =10%<br>
In the process described in EP-A-0 773 919, selective oxidation to a carboxyl group occurs of the hydroxymethyl and formyl group located in the position ortho to a hydroxyl group, p-vanillic acid is only obtained in a very low yield of 1%.<br><br>
Against all expectations, the Applicant has discovered that p-vanillic acid can be obtained by oxidising vanillin using the same type of catalytic system but under certain processing conditions.<br>
It has also unexpectedly been discovered that the process of the invention can be generalised to the preparation of any aromatic acid from the corresponding aldehyde provided that the conditions defined in the invention are satisfied.<br>
More precisely, the present invention provides a process for oxidising an aromatic aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid, consisting of carrying out the oxidation, in a basic medium, of an aromatic aldehyde using molecular oxygen or a gas containing molecular oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, characterized in that oxidation is carried out in the presence of an effective quantity of a palladium and/or platinum based catalyst under conditions such that oxidation occurs in the diffusion regime.<br>
In a preferred variation, the process of the invention further consists of adding, as an activator, metals from group lb and 8 such as cadmium, bismuth, lead, silver, tin or germanium, preferably bismuth.<br>
In particular, it has been discovered that a p-hydroxybenzoic acid can be obtained by oxidising a compound comprising a formyl group located in the position para to the hydroxyl group provided that the reaction conditions are controlled; they must be diffusion regime.<br>
In the present text, the term 'diffusion regime'\ also known as 'physical regime" denotes conditions that correspond to the conventional definition known to the skilled person.<br>
Reference in this regard should be made to the work by J. RICHARDSON, Principles of Catalyst Development (1989), Plenum Press, New York, and by J. VILLERMAUX, Genie de la reaction chimique: conception et fonctionnement des reacteurs [Engineering the chemical reaction: reactor design and function] (1993), Lavoisier.<br>
Diffusion regime conditions are such that the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the medium is close to zero.<br><br>
In the following disclosure of the invention, the term 'aromatic aldehyde" means an aromatic compound wherein one hydrogen atom directly bonded to the aromatic ring is replaced by a formyl group, and the term "aromatic compound" denotes the conventional notion of aromaticity as defined in the literature, in particular by Jerry MARCH, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, pp. 40 ff.<br>
More particularly, the present invention is applicable to aromatic aldehydes carrying a free OH group or an OH group that is protected in the form of an ether.<br><br>
•	A denotes the residue of a cyclic group forming all or a portion of an aromatic monocyclic or polycyclic carbocyclic or heterocyclic system comprising at least one formyl group;<br>
•	R represents a hydrogen atom or one or more substituents which may be identical or different;<br>
•	n, the number of substituents in a cyclic group, is 5 or less.<br>

2° - of a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic heterocyclic compound. The term "polycyclic heterocyclic compound" means:<br>
•	a compound constituted by at least 2 heterocycles containing at least one heteroatom in each cycle at least one of the two cycles being aromatic and together forming ortho- or ortho- and peri-condensed systems;<br>
•	a compound constituted by at least one carbocycle and at least one heterocycle at least one of the cycles being aromatic and together forming ortho- or ortho- and peri-condensed systems.<br>
More particularly, optionally substituted residue A represents one of the following cycles:<br>
•	an aromatic carbocycle:<br><br>
•	an aromatic bicycle comprising two aromatic carbocycles:<br><br>
•	a partially aromatic bicycle comprising two carbocycles one of which is aromatic:<br><br><br>
•	an aromatic heterocycle comprising 1 or more (2 to 4) heteroatoms;<br><br>
•	an  aromatic  bicycle  comprising  an   aromatic   carbocycle  and   an   aromatic<br>
heterocycle:<br><br>

•	an aromatic bicycle comprising two aromatic heterocycles:<br><br>
•	a partially aromatic bicycle comprising a carbocycle and an aromatic heterocycle:<br><br>
•	a tricycle comprising at least one carbocycle or an aromatic heterocycle:<br><br>

The aromatic compound with formula (I) can carry one or more substituents.<br>
The number of substituents present on the cycle depends on the carbon condensation of the cycle and the presence or absence of unsaturated bonds on the cycle.<br>
The maximum number of substituents that can be carried by a cycle can readily be determined by the skilled person.<br><br>
In the present text, the term 'several" generally means less than 5 substituents on an aromatic ring.<br>
Advantageously, n is 1 or 2.<br>
Examples of substituents are given below, but this list is not limiting in nature.<br>

•	two groups R1placed on two neighbouring carbon atoms can form a cycle contiining 5 to 7 atoms together with the carbon atoms carrying them.<br>
When m is 1 or more, two groups R\ and the 2 successive atoms on the benzene ring can be bonded together by an alkylene, alkenylene or alkenylidene group containing 3 to 5 carbon atoms to form a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic cyclic group containing 5 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a benzene ring.<br>
Groups R1and R2 can be bonded together and form an alkylene, alkenylidene or alkenylidene group containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms to form a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic heterocycle containing 5 to 7 atoms with the two neighbouring carbon atoms that carry R\ and OR2. One or more carbon atoms can be replaced by a further heteroatom, preferably oxygen. Then groups OR2 and R1can represent a methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy group.<br>
In formula (la), the cycle can optionally be substituted; examples of cyclic substituents that can be envisaged include substituents such as Rj, the meaning of which is given above for R in formula (I) for the aromatic aldehydes.<br>

Catalytic masses based on carbon black are particularly suitable.<br>
Generally, the metal is deposited in an amount of 0.5% to 95%, preferably 1% to 5% of the catalyst weight.<br>
The quantity of catalyst used, expressed as the weight of metal Mi with respect to that of the compound with formula (I) or (la), can vary from 0.001% to 10%, preferably 0.002% to 2%.<br>
Further details regarding the catalysts can be obtained from United States patent US-A-3 673 257, and French patents FR-A-2 305 420 and FR-A-2 350 323.<br>
The activator can be selected from all those mentioned in the above patents. Preferably, bismuth, lead and cadmium are used as the free metal or as cations. In the latter case, the associated anion is not critical and all derivatives of these metals can be used. Preferably, bismuth metal or its derivatives is used.<br>
A mineral or organic bismuth derivative can be used in which the bismuth atom has an oxidation number of more than zero, for example 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Preferred bismuth derivatives for use in the process of the invention are: bismuth oxides; bismuth hydroxides; bismuth or bismuthyl salts of inorganic hydracids; bismuth or bismuthyl salts of inorganic oxyacids; bismuth or bismuthyl salts of aliphatic or aromatic organic acids; and bismuth or bismuthyl phenates.<br>
A particularly suitable group of activators for carrying out the process of the invention is constituted by: bismuth oxides Bi203 and Bi204; bismuth hydroxide Bi(OH)3; neutral bismuth sulphate Bi2(S04)3; bismuth chloride B1CI3; bismuth bromide BiBr3; bismuth iodide Bil3; neutral bismuth nitrate Bi(N03)3,5H20; bismuthyl nitrate BiO(N03); bismuthyl carbonate (BiO)2CO3,0.5H2O; bismuth acetate Bi(C2H302)3; and bismuthyl salicylate C6H4C02(BiO)(OH). The quantity of activator used, expressed as the quantity of metal contained in the activator with respect to the weight of metal Mi used, can be varied between wide limits. As an example, this quantity can be as low as 0.1% and can attain the weight of metal Mi used, or even exceed it without any problems. Advantageously, it is about 50%.<br>
The pH is an important parameter in the process of the invention. It must be alkaline and is advantageously between 10 and 12.<br>
Basic agents are employed, also alkaline or alkaline-earth bases; examples that can be cited are hydroxides such as sodium, potassium or lithium hydroxide.<br>
Sodium or potassium hydroxide are used for reasons of economy.<br>
The concentration of basic starting solution is not critical. The concentration of the alkali metal hydroxide solution employed is generally between 5% and 50% by weight.<br><br>
The quantity of base introduced into the reaction medium takes into account the quantity necessary to form the salt of the carboxylic function that is formed and to form the salt of the hydroxy 1 function when the compound with formula (I) or (la) contains one.<br>
If said compound has salt-forming functions other than a hydroxyl group, the quantity of base necessary to form the salts of all of the salt-forming ftmctions is introduced.<br>
Generally, the quantity of base expressed with respect to the compound with formula (I) or (la) is in the range 90% to 200% of the stoichiometric quantity.<br>
The concentration by weight of compound with formula (I) in the liquid phase is normally in the range 1% and 40%, preferably in the range 2% to 30%.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the oxidation temperature is preferably in the range 20°C to 140°C, more preferably in the range 30°C to 100°C.<br>
Generally, atmospheric pressure is applied, but it is possible to operate at a pressure between 1 and 20 bars.<br>
Regarding the stirring conditions, the skilled person is capable of determining them to maintain a diffusion regime.<br>
By way of indication, it can be stated that in the case of a 3.2 litre reactor provided with a stirrer using 4 inclined paddles immersed in the reaction medium, the stirring conditions are advantageously in the range 500 to 700 rpm.<br>
In practice one manner of carrying out the process consists of introducing the compound with formula (I), the basic agent, the palladium and/or platinum based catalyst, and optional activator in the proportions indicated above.<br>
This implementation is entirely suitable when the compound with formula (I) carries a<br>
hydroxyl group.<br>
When the compound with formula (I) or (la) carries a hydroxyl group in the protected form (ether), then in general, the water, basic agent, palladium and/or platinum based catalyst, activator and compound with formula (I) or (la) are charged.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is then heated in a stream of an inert gas (for example nitrogen) to the desired reaction temperature, then oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas is introduced.<br>
The mixture is then stirred at the desired temperature until a quantity of oxygen corresponding to that necessary to transform the formyl group into a carboxyl group has been consumed.<br>
At the end of the reaction, which preferably takes between 30 minutes and 6 hours, recovery takes place of the carboxylic compound with formula (III), formula corresponding to formula (I), preferably (la) in which the CHO group is replaced by COOM; M representing the cation corresponding to that of the base employed.<br>
Then after cooling if necessary, the catalytic mass is separated from the reaction medium, for example by filtering.<br>
In a subsequent step, the resulting medium is acidified by adding a protonic acid of mineral origin, preferably hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or an organic acid such as methanesulphonic acid to obtain a pH that is lower than the pKa of the acid obtained.<br>
The concentration of acid is of no consequence; preferably, commercially available forms are used.<br>
Acidification is generally carried out between ambient temperature (usually between l5°Cand25X)andlOOX.<br>
The precipitated aromatic acid is then recovered using conventional liquid/solid separation techniques, preferably by filtering.<br>
It satisfies formula (IV), which corresponds to formula (I), preferably (la) in which the CHO group has been replaced by COOH.<br>
The process of the invention is of particular application to the preparation of the following carboxylic acids: p-methoxybenzoic acid, p-vanillic acid, o-vanillic acid, isovanillic acid, 3-ethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, veratric acid, piperonic acid, protocatechuic acid and 2,6-hydroxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid.<br><br>
The reaction can be carried out in any type of reactor provided that the parameters of the process are selected to allow it to be carried out under physical conditions as regards oxygen. The examples use the apparatus described, but it is not limiting. The following examples illustrate the invention without in any way limiting its scope. In the examples, the degree of conversion (TT) corresponds to the ratio between the number of moles of substrate transformed and the number of moles of substrate used.<br>
The yield (RR) corresponds to the ratio between the number of moles of product formed and the number of moles of substrate used.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of p-vanillic acid 190 g of vanillin, 1900 g of water and 560 g of an aqueous 30% w/w sodium hydroxide sokition were introduced into a 3200 ml stainless steel reactor with a diameter of 150 mm provided with a stirring system (central and counter-blade stirring).<br>
Stirring was carried out using a stirrer with 4 inclined blades wherein the propeller was positioned so that it was one third of the depth of the liquid in the reactor off the bottom thereof<br>
It was stirred and 10 g of a catalyst comprising palladium deposited on carbon (activated charcoal) in an amount of 3% by weight with respect to the total catalyst weight and 0.325 g of Bi203 were introduced.<br>
The reactor was purged with nitrogen prior to stirring. The reactor was then heated to 95°C at a stirring rate of 700 rpm.<br>
A 50 g/h stream of air was then introduced via an immersed tube, maintaining a pressure of 1.5 bars in the reactor.<br>
The reaction had to be carried out under a diffusion regime.<br>
When it was noted that no more oxygen was being consumed, the reaction was stopped.<br>
The reactor was purged with a stream of nitrogen.<br><br>
The temperature was allowed to drop to about 50°C and the reactioh- medium was filtered.<br>
High performance liquid chromatographic analysis recorded a TT of 97.4% and an RR for p-vanillic acid of 95.4%.<br>
The catalyst could be used again under the same conditions without adding 81203.<br>
High performance liquid chromatographic analysis recorded a TT of 97.6% and an RR for p-vanillic acid of 95.5%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of veratric acid<br>
190 g of veratric aldehyde, 1900 g of water and 336 g of an aqueous 30% w/w sodium hydroxide solution were introduced into a 3200 ml stainless steel reactor.<br>
It was stirred and 10 g of 3% Pd/C catalyst and 0.325 g of BiaOa were introduced.<br>
The reactor was purged with nitrogen prior to stirring.<br>
The reactor was then heated to 95'C at a stirring rate of 700 rpm.<br>
A 50 g/h stream of air was then introduced, maintaining a pressure of 1.5 bars in the reactor.<br>
The reaction had to be carried out under diffusion regime.<br>
When it was noted that no more oxygen was being consumed, the reaction was stopped.<br>
The reactor was purged with a stream of nitrogen and the temperature was allowed to drop to about SO^'C.<br>
The reaction medium was filtered.<br>
High performance liquid chromatographic analysis recorded a TT of 97% and an RR for veratric acid of 95.2%.<br>
The catalyst could be used again under the same conditions without adding BiaOs.<br>
No drop in activity or selectivity was observed.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Example I was repeated, using 190 g of o-vanillic acid.<br>
Under these conditions, the following results were obtained: TT of 99% and RR for o-vanillic acid of 95%.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of p-vanillic acid<br>
Example 1 was repeated, using a stirring rate of 1000 rpm.  In this example, a chemical regime was established.<br>
Catalyst deactivation was observed and the results were: TT = 2% and RR for vanillic acid = 1.8%.<br><br><br><br>
