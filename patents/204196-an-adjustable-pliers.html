AN ADJUSTABLE PLIERS<br>
TAP ARIA TOOLS LIMITED<br>

Mumbai 400 013, Maharashtra, India<br>
an Indian Company<br>
GRANTED<br>
17-6-2004<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES   THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br>
1 7 JUN 2004<br><br>
This invention relates to an adjustable pliers.<br>
The concept of water pump pliers was developed much earlier for the ease of work while working on equipment such as boilers, steam turbines, water and liquid handling pumps, and during the work of water pipe fittings and installation of household and industrial water lines and fittings.<br>
Essentially two separate hand tools were used to handle the pipe fittings and for fittings of taps, cocks, valves hand tools such as spanners, adjustable wrenches and tools which can grip small shafts or pipes, hexagonal nuts, square nuts and shanks of the adjustable and shut off valves. Both these features are combined to develop a hand tool which can handle small diameters of pipe fittings as well can be used as a tool to screw and unscrew the nuts and bolts and intermediate shafts etc.<br>
With the above background and with industrialization and with increase in automobile production this hand tool has found greater application in the fitment of pipe lines of radiator and water pump as well as in the fitment of accessories of air conditioners etc. in automobiles.<br><br><br>
The pliers, envisaged in accordance with this invention, is a versatile tool having combination of features of a spanner/wrench as well as pipe wrench. This tool can be used for holding/fitting of pipes as well as for holding irregular shape of parts and accessories and for tightening/loosening of nuts and bolts.<br>
The invention envisages pliers with a particularly invented geometry of the grip with considerable engineering and analysis which consist of clamping jaw in the shape of "Vee" with serrations and plain surface on each jaw such that the serration faces are located opposite each other and so also plain faces after assembly of both jaws.<br>
The angle of the "Vee" is so designed to have a firm grip on the object in any position from smallest to largest size that can be accommodated.<br>
The above design enables to grip all the following type of geometrical surfaces firmly.<br>
•	Round surfaces.<br>
•	Half round surfaces.<br>
•	Flat surfaces.<br>
•	Shafts with flats.<br>
•	Rectangular and square parts.<br><br><br>
Hexagonal parts such as nuts, bolts, etc.<br>
The front portion of the jaws are designed with a flat surface with serration, so as to allow the tool to enable grip on small parts such as screws, chips, flat pins, wires that are wound round the pipes for securing in place etc.<br>
The plier in accordance with this invention consist of two jaws which are adjustable in plurality of positions, one jaw being capable of displacing with respect of other jaw and locked on plurality of profiles for locating formations.<br>
The insulated shanks allows the tool to be used in live wire operations also.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an adjustable pliers consisting of two handles having insulated shanks, and jaws extending from the handles, One of the handles being provided with a lengthwise groove, the other handle being provided with a sliding spindle adapted to slide in the groove, said spindle being locked in place in the groove by means of rivet; locking formations 26 provided on the side of the groove which permit the spindle to be locked in place at various positions corresponding to different size of nuts or other elements to be gripped by the jaw of the pliers said locking formations locking the groove co-operating with raised profiles 24 on the end<br><br><br>
surface of the jaw holding the spindle, so that the two jaws firmly lock in place at any of the locking formation.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the jaws are angled and lock in a "S" shaped profile at the front end of the pliers enabling the pliers to open nuts in any position and even in any confined spaces. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;<br>
Figure 1 is the front view of the pliers in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is the rear view of the pliers in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 3 is the left side view of the pliers in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 4 is the right side view of the pliers in accordance of the invention; and<br>
Figure 5 is the top view of the pliers in accordance with the invention.<br><br><br>
Referring to the drawings, the pliers in accordance with this invention is indicated generally by the reference numeral 10. The plier consists of two handles 12 and 14, and jaw 16 and 18 extending from the handles. The handle 12 is provided with a lengthwise groove 20. Whereas, the handle 14 has a sliding spindle adopted to slide in the groove 20. The spindle 22 is locked in place in the groove by means of rivet.<br>
On the side of groove various locking formations 26 are provided which typically permit the spindle tobe locked in place at various positions to different sizes. The locking formations 26 locking the groove co-operate with a raised profile 24 on the end surface of the jaw holding the spindle, so that the two jaws firmly lock in place at any of the locking formation 26. The angled jaws lock in a "S" shaped profile of the front end of the pliers. This enables the pliers to open nuts in any.position and even in any confined spaces. Both round as well as flat surface of the nut can be held firmly and either locked or unlocked with the help of this plier. Typically, pipes from 1/8 inch to 1 1/2 inch can be locked and nuts from 4.5 mm to 40 mm can be handled with the help of the pliers in accordance with this invention.<br><br><br>
The invention envisages pliers with a particularly invented geometry of the grip with considerable engineering and analysis which consist of clamping jaw in the shape of "Vee" with serration and plain surface on each jaw such that the serration faces are located opposite each other and so also plain faces after assembly of both jaws.<br>
The angle of the "Vee" is so designed to have a firm grip on the object in any position from smallest to largest size that can be accommodated.<br>
Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and applications, one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of this teaching, can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of or exceeding the scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the drawings and descriptions herein are proffered by way of example to facilitate comprehension of the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope thereof.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An adjustable pliers consisting of two handles having<br>
insulated shanks, and jaws extending from the handles,<br>
One of the handles being provided with a lengthwise<br>
groove, the other handle being provided with a sliding<br>
spindle adapted to slide in the groove, said spindle<br>
being locked in place in the groove by means of rivet;<br>
locking formations provided on the side of the groove<br>
which permit the spindle to be locked in place' at<br>
various positions corresponding to different size of nuts<br>
or other elements to be gripped by the jaw of the pliers,<br>
said locking formations locking the groove co-<br>
operating with raised profiles on the end surface of the<br>
jaw holding the spindle, so that the two jaws firmly<br>
lock in place at any of the locking formation, the jaws<br>
being angled and adapted to lock in a "S" shaped<br>
profile at the front end of the pliers enabling the pliers<br>
to open nuts in any position and even in any confined<br>
spaces.<br>
2.	An adjustable pliers as claimed in claim 1, in which<br>
clamping jaws are in the shape of "Vee" with serrations<br>
and plain surface on each jaw such that the serration<br>
faces are located opposite each other and so also plain<br>
faces after assembly of both jaws.<br><br><br>
3. An adjustable pliers as claimed in Claim 1 and described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
