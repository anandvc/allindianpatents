DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery of novel antibodies and methods of using antibodies that are specific to or have a high affinity for CD38 and can deliver a therapeutic benefit to a subject. The antibodies, which may be human or humanized, can be used in many contexts, which are more fully described herein. Suitable antibodies for use in the present invention are disclosed in US 60/614,471, which hereby is incorporated by reference.<br>
A "human" antibody or functional human antibody fragment is hereby defined as one that<br>
is not chimeric (e.g., not "humanized") and not from (either in whole or in part) a non-human species. A human antibody or functional antibody fragment can be derived from a human or can be a synthetic human antibody. A "synthetic human antibody" is defined herein as an antibody having a sequence derived, in whole or in part, in silico from synthetic sequences that are based on the analysis of known human antibody sequences.   In silico design of a human antibody sequence or fragment thereof can be achieved, for example, by analyzing a database of human antibody or antibody fragment sequences and devising a polypeptide sequence utilizing the data obtained therefrom. Another example of a human antibody or functional antibody fragment, is one that is encoded by a nucleic acid isolated from a library of antibody sequences of human origin (i.e., such library being based on antibodies taken from a human natural source).<br>
A "humanized antibody" or functional humanized antibody fragment is defined herein as one that is (i) derived from a non-human source (e.g., a transgenic mouse which bears a<br><br>
heterologous immune system), which antibody is based on a human germline sequence; or (ii) chimeric, wherein the variable domain is derived from a non-human origin and the constant domain is derived from a human origin or (iii) CDR-grafted, wherein the CDRs of the variable domain are from a non-human origin, while one or more frameworks of the variable domain are of human origin and the constant domain (if any) is of human origin.<br>
As used herein, an antibody "binds specifically to," is "specific to/for" or "specifically recognizes" an antigen (here, CD38) if such antibody is able to discriminate between such antigen and one or more reference antigen(s), since binding specificity is not an absolute, but a relative property.   In its most general form (and when no defined reference is mentioned), "specific binding" is referring to the ability of the antibody to discriminate between the antigen of interest and an unrelated antigen, as determined, for example, in accordance with one of the following methods. Such methods comprise, but are not limited to Western blots, ELISA-, RJA-, ECL-, IRMA-tests, FACS, IHC and peptide scans. For example, a standard ELISA assay can be carried out.   The scoring may be carried out by standard color development (e.g. secondary antibody with horseradish peroxide and tetramethyl benzidine with hydrogenperoxide).   The reaction in certain wells is scored by the optical density, for example, at 450 nm. Typical background (=negative reaction) may be 0.1 OD; typical positive reaction may be 1 OD. This means the difference positive/negative can be more than 10-fold.   Typically, determination of binding specificity is performed by using not a single reference antigen, but a set of about three to five unrelated antigens, such as milk powder, BSA, transferrin or the like. It is possible for an antibody to be "specific to" or "specific for" an antigen of 2 or more cells/tissues and/or 2 or more species, provided that the antibody meets binding criteria for each of such cells/tissues and species, for example. Accordingly, an antibody may bind specifically to the target antigen CDS 8<br><br>
on various cell types and/or tissues, e.g. erythrocytes, lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood, spleen or lymph-nodes. In addition, an antibody may be specific to both CD38 of one species and CD38 of another species.<br>
"Specific binding" also may refer to the ability of an antibody to discriminate between the target antigen and one or more closely related antigen(s), which are used as reference points, e.g. between CD38 and GDI57. Additionally, "specific binding" may relate to the ability of an antibody to discriminate between different parts of its target antigen, e.g. different domains or regions of CD38, such as epitopes in the N-terminal or in the C-terminal region of CD38, or between one or more key amino acid residues or stretches of amino acid residues of CD38.<br>
Also, as used herein, an "immunoglobulin" (Ig) hereby is defined as a protein belonging to the class IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, or IgD (or any subclass thereof), and includes all conventionally known  antibodies  and  functional  fragments  thereof.     A  "functional  fragment"  of an antibody/immunoglobulin hereby is defined as a fragment of an antibody/immunoglobulin (e.g., a variable region of an IgG) that retains the antigen-binding region. An "antigen-binding region" of an antibody typically is found in one or more hypervariable region(s) of an antibody, i.e., the CDR-1, -2, and/or -3 regions; however, the variable "framework" regions can also play an important role in antigen binding, such as by providing a scaffold for the CDRs. Preferably, the "antigen-binding region" comprises at least amino acid residues 4 to 103 of the variable light (VL) chain and 5 to 109 of the variable heavy (VH) chain, more preferably amino acid residues 3 to 107 of VL and 4 to 111 of VH, and particularly preferred are the complete VL and VH chains (amino acid positions 1 to 109 of VL and 1 to 113 of VH; numbering according to WO 97/08320).   A preferred class of immunoglobulins for use in the present invention is IgG. "Functional fragments" of the invention include the domain of a F(ab')2 fragment, a Fab<br><br>
fragment and scFv. The F(ab)2 or Fab may be engineered to minimize or completely remove the intermolecular disulphide interactions that occur between the CHI and CL domains.<br>
The term "parental binder" as used in connection with the present invention denotes any binder which has not undergone the process of optimization. A process of optimization is described elsewhere in the present specification.<br>
The term "binder" as used in connection with the present invention may be used in a synonymous manner as the term "immunoglobulin" or "antibody".<br>
An antibody for use in the invention may be derived from a recombinant antibody library that is based on amino acid sequences that have been designed in silica and encoded by nucleic acids that are synthetically created. In silica design of an antibody sequence is achieved, for example, by analyzing a database of human sequences and devising a polypeptide sequence utilizing the data obtained therefrom.

Antibodies of the invention were characterized in Fab and/or IgG format and comprise various combinations of the light and heavy chains of optimized and parental binders. Figure 10 shows several non-limiting combinations which can be used in connection with the present invention.<br><br>
In one aspect, the invention provides methods for using antibodies having an antigen-binding region that can bind specifically to or has a high affinity for one or more regions of CDS8, whose amino acid sequence is depicted by SEQ ID NO: 71. An antibody is said to have a "high affinity" for an antigen if the affinity measurement is at least 100 nM (monovalent affinity of Fab fragment).   An antibody or antigen-binding region for use in the present invention preferably can bind to CD38 with an affinity of about less than 600 nM. Preferably, the antibody or antigen-binding region for use in the present invention can bind to CD38 with an affinity of about less than 100 nM, more preferably less than about 60 nM, and still more preferably less than about 30 nM. Further preferred are uses of antibodies that bind to CD38 with an affinity of less than about 10 nM, and more preferably less than 3 about nM. For instance, the affinity of an antibody for use in the invention against CD38 may be about 10.0 nM or 2.4 nM (monovalent affinity of Fab fragment).<br>
Table 1 provides a summary of affinities of representative antibodies, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and FACS Scatchard analysis:<br>

With reference to Table 1, the affinity of LACs was measured by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) on human CD38 Fc-fusion and by a flow cytometry procedure utilizing the CD38-expressing human Raji cell line. The Biacore studies were performed on directly immobilized antigen (CD38-Fc fusion protein). The Fab format of LACs exhibit an monovalent affinity range between about 30 and 596 nM on immobilized CD38-Fc fusion protein.<br>
The IgGl format was used for the cell-based affinity determination (FACS Scatchard). The right column of Table 1 denotes the binding strength of the LACS in this format.<br>
Another preferred feature of preferred antibodies for use in the invention is their specificity for an area within the N-terminal region of CD38. For example, LACs of the invention can bind specifically to the N-terminal region of CD38.<br>
Optimized antibodies of the present invention were further characterized as shown in Tables 2 and 3. Summaries are provided of affinities as determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) and FACS Scatchard analysis. Additionally, FACS-binding to human erythrocytes and EL1SA binding studies to CD38 Fc-Fusion protein have also been determined. The characterizations show that several optimized binders show a reduced binding to human erythrocytes and a higher ELISA signal as compared to the parental clone. In addition derivatives of MOR03088 have an improved affinity as shown by FACS Scatchards and affinity determinations.<br><br>

The type of epitope to which an antibody for use in the invention binds may be linear (i.e. one consecutive stretch of amino acids) or conformational (i.e. multiple stretches of amino acids). In order to determine whether the epitope of a particular antibody is linear or conformational, the skilled worker can analyze the binding of antibodies to overlapping peptides (e.g., 13-mer peptides with an overlap of 11 amino acids) covering different domains of CD38. LACS may recognize discontinuous or linear epitopes in the N-terminal region of CD38. Combined with the knowledge provided herein, the skilled worker in the art will know how to use one or more isolated epitopes of CD38 for generating antibodies having an antigen-binding region that is specific for said epitopes (e.g. using synthetic peptides of epitopes of CD38 or cells expressing epitopes of CD38).<br>
An antibody for use in the invention preferably is species cross-reactive with humans and at least one other non-human species. The non-human species can be non-human primate, e.g. rhesus, baboon and/or cynomolgus. Other non-human species can be minipig, rabbit, mouse, rat and/or hamster. An antibody that is cross reactive with at least one other species beside human can provide greater flexibility and benefits over known anti-CD38 antibodies, for purposes of conducting in vivo studies in multiple species with the same antibody. An antibody that is cross reactive with minipig and/or rabbit, for example, can be a candidate for toxicology and safety studies.<br>
Preferably, an antibody for use in the invention not only is able to bind to CD38, but also is able to mediate killing of a cell expressing CD38. More specifically, an antibody for use in the invention can mediate its therapeutic effect by depleting CD38-positive (e.g., malignant) cells via antibody-effector functions. These functions include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).<br>
CD38-expression, however, is not only found on immune cells within the myeloid (e.g. monocytes, granulocytes) and lymphoid lineage (e.g. activated B and T-cells; plasma cells), but also on the respective precursor cells. Since it is important that those cells are not affected by antibody-mediated killing of malignant cells, the antibodies of the present invention are preferably not cytotoxic to precursor cells.<br>
In addition to its catalytic activities as a cyclic ADP-ribose cyclase and hydrolase, CD38 displays the ability to transduce signals of biological relevance (Hoshino et al.&gt; 1997; Ausiello et al, 2000). Those functions can be induced in vivo by, e.g. receptor-ligand interactions or by cross-linking with agonistic anti-CD38 antibodies, leading, e.g. to calcium mobilization, lymphocyte proliferation and release of cytokines. Preferably, the antibodies of the present invention are non-agonistic antibodies.<br>
Peptide Variants<br>
Antibodies for use in the invention are not limited to the specific peptide sequences<br>
provided herein. Rather, the invention also embodies the use of variants of these polypeptides.<br>
With reference to the instant disclosure and conventionally available technologies and<br>
references, the skilled worker will be able to prepare, test and utilize functional variants of the<br>
antibodies disclosed herein, while appreciating that variants having the ability to mediate killing<br>
of a CD38+ target cell fall within the scope of the present invention.  As used in this context,<br>
"ability to mediate killing of a CD38+ target cell" means a functional characteristic ascribed to<br>
an anti-CD38 antibody for use in the invention.  Ability to mediate killing of a CD38+ target<br>
cell, thus, includes the ability to mediate killing of a CD38+ target cell, e.g. by ADCC and/or<br>
CDC, or by toxin constructs conjugated to an antibody for use in the invention.<br>
A variant can include, for example, an antibody that has at least one altered complementarity determining region (CDR) (hyper-variable) and/or framework (FR) (variable) domain/position, vis-a-vis a peptide sequence disclosed herein. To better illustrate this concept, a brief description of antibody structure follows.<br>
An antibody is composed of two peptide chains, each containing one (light chain) or three (heavy chain) constant domains and a variable region (VL, VH), the latter of which is in each case made up of four FR regions and three interspaced CDRs. The antigen-binding site is formed by one or more CDRs, yet the FR regions provide the structural framework for the CDRs and, hence, play an important role in antigen binding. By altering one or more amino acid residues in a CDR or FR region, the skilled worker routinely can generate mutated or diversified antibody sequences, which can be screened against the antigen, for new or improved properties, for example.<br>
Figures 14 a (VH) and 14 b (VL) delineate the CDR and FR regions for certain antibodies for use in the invention and compare amino acids at a given position to each other and to corresponding consensus or "master gene" sequences (as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,300,064).<br>
The skilled worker will be able to design peptide variants, the use of which is within the scope of the present invention. It is preferred that variants are constructed by changing amino acids within one or more CDR regions; a variant might also have one or more altered framework regions. Alterations also may be made in the framework regions. For example, a peptide FR domain might be altered where there is a deviation in a residue compared to a germline sequence.<br>
Furthermore, variants may be obtained by using one LAC as starting point for optimization by diversifying one or more amino acid residues in the LAC, preferably amino acid residues in one or more CDRs, and by screening the resulting collection of antibody variants for variants with improved properties. Particularly preferred is diversification of one or more amino acid residues in CDR-3 of VL, CDR-3 of VH, CDR-1 of VL and/or CDR-2 of VH. Diversification can be done by synthesizing a collection of DNA molecules using trinucleotide mutagenesis (TRIM) technology (VirnekSs, B., Ge, L, Pluckthun, A., Schneider, K.C., Wellnhofer, G., and Moroney S.E. (1994) Trinucleotide phosphoramidites: ideal reagents for the synthesis of mixed oligonucleotides for random mutagenesis. Nucl. Acids Res. 22,5600).<br>
Conservative Amino Acid Variants<br>
Polypeptide variants may be made that conserve the overall molecular structure of an antibody peptide sequence described herein. Given the properties of the individual amino acids, some rational substitutions will be recognized by the skilled worker. Amino acid substitutions, i.e., "conservative substitutions," may be made, for instance, on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved.<br>
For example, (a) nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; (b) polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; (c) positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and (d) negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Substitutions typically may be made within groups (a)-(d). In addition, glycine and proline may be substituted for one another based on their ability to disrupt α-helices. Similarly, certain amino acids, such as alanine, cysteine, leucine,<br>
methionine, glutamic acid, glutamine, histidine and lysine are more commonly found in <x-helices while valine isoleucine phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan and threonine are more commonly found in p-pleated sheets. glycine serine aspartic acid asparagine proline turns. some preferred substitutions may be made among the following groups: s t p g a v l i. given known genetic code recombinant synthetic dna techniques skilled scientist readily can construct dnas encoding conservative amino variants. one particular example position seq id nos: changed from q to an e.></x-helices>
As used herein, "sequence identity" between two polypeptide sequences indicates the percentage of amino acids that are identical between the sequences. "Sequence similarity" indicates the percentage of amino acids that either are identical or that represent conservative amino acid substitutions. Preferred polypeptide sequences of the invention have a sequence identity in the CDR regions of at least 60%, more preferably, at least 70% or 80%, still more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%. Preferred antibodies also have a sequence similarity in the CDR regions of at least 80%, more preferably 90% and most preferably 95%. Preferred polypeptide sequences of the invention have a sequence identity in the variable regions of at least 60%, more preferably, at least 70% or 80%, still more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%. Preferred antibodies also have a sequence similarity in the variable regions of at least 80%, more preferably 90% and most preferably 95%.<br>
DNA molecules of the invention<br>
The present invention also relates to uses of DNA molecules that encode an antibody for use in the invention. These sequences include, but are not limited to, those DNA molecules set forth in Figures la and 2a.<br><br>
DNA molecules of the invention are not limited to the sequences disclosed herein, but also include variants thereof.  DNA variants within the invention may be described by reference to their physical properties in hybridization.  The skilled worker will recognize that DNA can be used to identify its complement and, since DNA is double stranded, its equivalent or homolog, using nucleic acid hybridization techniques.   It also will be recognized that hybridization can occur with less than 100% complementarity. However, given appropriate choice of conditions, hybridization techniques can be used to differentiate among DNA sequences based on their structural relatedness to a particular probe.    For guidance regarding such conditions see, Sambrook et al., 1989 (Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, USA) and Ausubel et al., 1995 (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Sedman, J. G., Smith, J. A., &amp; Struhl, K. eds. (1995). Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. New York: John Wiley and Sons).<br>
Structural similarity between two polynucleotide sequences can be expressed as a function of "stringency" of the conditions under which the two sequences will hybridize with one another. As used herein, the term  "stringency" refers to the extent that the conditions disfavor hybridization.     Stringent conditions  strongly disfavor hybridization,  and only  the  most structurally related molecules will hybridize to one another under such conditions. Conversely, non-stringent conditions favor hybridization of molecules displaying a lesser degree of structural relatedness.     Hybridization  stringency,   therefore,   directly  correlates  with  the   structural relationships of two nucleic acid sequences. The following relationships are useful in correlating hybridization and relatedness (where Tm is the melting temperature of a nucleic acid duplex):<br>
a.        Tm==69.3 + 0.41(G+C)%<br><br>
b.	The Tm of a duplex DNA decreases by 1 °C with every increase of 1 % in<br>
the number of mismatched base pairs.<br>
c.	(Tm)µ2 - (Tm) ,,1 = 18.5 Iog,10µ2/µl<br>
where µl and µ2 are the ionic strengths of two solutions.<br>
Hybridization stringency is a function of many factors, including overall DNA concentration, ionic strength, temperature, probe size and the presence of agents which disrupt hydrogen bonding. Factors promoting hybridization include high DNA concentrations, high ionic strengths, low temperatures, longer probe size and the absence of agents that disrupt hydrogen bonding. Hybridization typically is performed in two phases: the "binding" phase and the "washing" phase.<br>
First, in the binding phase, the probe is bound to the target under conditions favoring hybridization. Stringency is usually controlled at this stage by altering the temperature. For high stringency, the temperature is usually between 65°C and 70°C, unless short (
Second, the excess probe is removed by washing. It is at this phase that more stringent conditions usually are applied. Hence, it is this "washing" stage that is most important in determining relatedness via hybridization. Washing solutions typically contain lower salt concentrations. One exemplary medium stringency solution contains 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS. A<br><br>
high stringency wash solution contains the equivalent (in ionic strength) of less than about 0.2X SSC, with a preferred stringent solution containing about O.1X SSC. The temperatures associated with various stringencies are the same as discussed above for "binding." The washing solution also typically is replaced a number of times during washing. For example, typical high stringency washing conditions comprise washing twice for 30 minutes at 55° C. and three times for 15 minutes at 60° C.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes the use of nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the molecules of set forth in Figures la and 2a under high stringency binding and washing conditions, where such nucleic molecules encode an antibody or functional fragment thereof for uses as described herein. Preferred molecules (from an mRNA perspective) are those that have at least 75% or 80% (preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%) homology or sequence identity with one of the DNA molecules described herein.<br>
Functionally Equivalent Variants<br>
Yet another class of DNA variants the use of which is within the scope of the invention may be described with reference to the product they encode (see the peptides listed in figures Ib and 2b). These functionally equivalent genes are characterized by the fact that they encode the same peptide sequences found in figures 1b and 2b due to the degeneracy of the genetic code.<br>
It is recognized that variants of DNA molecules provided herein can be constructed in several different ways. For example, they may be constructed as completely synthetic DNAs. Methods of efficiently synthesizing oligonucleotides in the range of 20 to about 150 nucleotides are widely available. See Ausubel et al, section 2.11, Supplement 21 (1993). Overlapping oligonucleotides may be synthesized and assembled in a fashion first reported by Khorana et al, J. Mol. Biol. 72:209-217 (1971); see also Ausubel et al., supra, Section 8.2. Synthetic DNAs<br><br>
preferably are designed with convenient restriction sites engineered at the 51 and 3' ends of the gene to facilitate cloning into an appropriate vector.<br>
As indicated, a method of generating variants is to start with one of the DNAs disclosed herein and then to conduct site-directed mutagenesis. See Ausubel et al., supra, chapter 8, Supplement 37 (1997). In a typical method, a target DNA is cloned into a single-stranded DNA bacteriophage vehicle. Single-stranded DNA is isolated and hybridized with an oligonucleotide containing the desired nucleotide alteration(s). The complementary strand is synthesized and the double stranded phage is introduced into a host. Some of the resulting progeny will contain the desired mutant, which can be confirmed using DNA sequencing. In addition, various methods are available that increase the probability that the progeny phage will be the desired mutant. These methods are well known to those in the field and kits are commercially available for generating such mutants.<br>
Recombinant DNA constructs and expression<br>
The present invention further provides for the use of recombinant DNA constructs comprising one or more of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention. The recombinant constructs are used in connection with a vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector, into which a DNA molecule encoding an antibody for use in the invention is inserted.<br>
The encoded gene may be produced by techniques described in Sambrook et al., 1989, and Ausubel et al, 1989. Alternatively, the DNA sequences may be chemically synthesized using, for example, synthesizers. See, for example, the techniques described in OLIGONUCLEOTIDE SYNTHESIS (1984, Gait, ed., IRL Press, Oxford), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Recombinant constructs of the invention are comprised with expression vectors that are capable of expressing the RNA and/or protein products of the encoded DNA(s). The vector may<br><br>
further comprise regulatory sequences, including a promoter operably linked to the open reading frame (ORF). The vector may further comprise a selectable marker sequence. Specific initiation and bacterial secretory signals also may be required for efficient translation of inserted target gene coding sequences.<br>
The present invention further provides for uses of host cells containing at least one of the DNAs disclosed herein. The host cell can be virtually any cell for which expression vectors are available. It may be, for example, a higher eukaryotic host cell, such as a mammalian cell, a lower eukaryotic host cell, such as a yeast cell, but preferably is a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the recombinant construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE, dextran mediated transfection, electroporation or phage infectioa<br>
Bacterial Expression<br>
Useful expression vectors for bacterial use are constructed by inserting a structural DNA sequence encoding a desired protein together with suitable translation initiation and termination signals in operable reading phase with a functional promoter. The vector will comprise one or more phenotypic selectable markers and an origin of replication to ensure maintenance of the vector and, if desirable, to provide amplification within the host. Suitable prokaryotic hosts for transformation include E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Staphylococcus.<br>
Bacterial vectors may be, for example, bacteriophage-, plasmid- or phagemid-based. These vectors can contain a selectable marker and bacterial origin of replication derived from commercially available plasmids typically containing elements of the well known cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). Following transformation of a suitable host strain and growth of the<br><br>
host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter is de-repressed/induced by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction) and cells are cultured for an additional period. Cells are typically harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification.<br>
In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the protein being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of antibodies or to screen peptide libraries, for example, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable.<br>
Therapeutic Methods<br>
Therapeutic methods involve administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody contemplated by the invention. A "therapeutically effective" amount hereby is defined as the amount of an antibody that is of sufficient quantity to deplete CD38-positive cells in a treated area of a subject—either as a single dose or according to a multiple dose regimen, alone or in combination with other agents, which leads to the alleviation of an adverse condition, yet which amount is lexicologically tolerable. The subject may be a human or non-human animal (e.g., rabbit, rat, mouse, monkey or other lower-order primate).<br>
An antibody for use in the invention might be co-administered with known medicaments, and in some instances the antibody might itself be modified. For example, an antibody could be conjugated to an immunotoxin or radioisotope to potentially further increase efficacy.<br>
Disorders and conditions particularly suitable for treatment with an antibody are multiple myeloma (MM) and other haematological diseases, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia<br><br>
(CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). An antibody also might be used to treat inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).<br>
To treat any of the foregoing disorders, pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients.  An antibody for use in the invention can be administered by any suitable means, which can vary, depending on the type of disorder being treated.    Possible administration routes include parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous), intrapulmonary and intranasal, and, if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment, intralesional administration. In addition, an antibody for use in the invention might be administered by pulse infusion, with, e.g., declining doses of the antibody. Preferably, the dosing is given by injections, most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. The amount to be administered will depend on a variety of factors such as the clinical symptoms, weight of the individual, whether other drugs are administered.    The skilled artisan will recognize that the route of administration will vary depending on the disorder or condition to be treated.<br>
Determining a therapeutically effective amount of the novel polypeptide, according to this invention, largely will depend on particular patient characteristics, route of administration, and the nature of the disorder being treated. General guidance can be found, for example, in the publications of the International Conference on Harmonisation and in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, chapters 27 and 28, pp. 484-528 (18th ed., Alfonso R. Gennaro, Ed., Easton, Pa.: Mack Pub. Co., 1990). More specifically, determining a therapeutically<br><br>
effective amount will depend on such factors as toxicity and efficacy of the medicament. Toxicity may be determined using methods well known in the art and found in the foregoing references. Efficacy may be determined utilizing the same guidance in conjunction with the methods described below in the Examples.<br>
Diagnostic Methods<br>
CD38 is highly expressed on hematological cells in certain malignancies; thus, an anti-CD38 antibody for use in the invention may be employed in order to image or visualize a site of possible accumulation of malignant cells in a patient.   In this regard, an antibody can be detectably labeled, through the use of radioisotopes, affinity labels (such as biotin, avidin, etc.) fluorescent labels, paramagnetic atoms, etc. Procedures for accomplishing such labeling are well known to the art.   Clinical application of antibodies in diagnostic imaging are reviewed by Grossman, H. B., Urol. Clin. North Amer. 13:465-474 (1986)), Unger, E. C. et al., Invest. Radiol. 20:693-700 (1985)), and Khaw, B. A. et al., Science 209:295-297 (1980)). Preferred antibodies or antigen-binding regions of the invention for use as a diagnostic compound comprise a variable heavy chain sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 16, 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, 27,28,29, 30, 92, 93,94,95, 96,97, 98, 99,100,101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106 and/or a variable light chain sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 46,47,48,49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57,58, 59,60, 109 and 110.<br>
The detection of foci of such detectably labeled antibodies might be indicative of a site of tumor development, for example. In one embodiment, this examination is done by removing samples of tissue or blood and incubating such samples in the presence of the detectably labeled antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, this technique is done in a non-invasive manner through the use of magnetic imaging, fluorography, etc. Such a diagnostic test may be employed in<br><br>
monitoring the success of treatment of diseases, where presence or absence of CD38-positive cells is a relevant indicator. The invention also contemplates the use of an anti-CD38 antibody, as described herein for diagnostics in an ex vivo setting.<br>
Therapeutic And Diagnostic Compositions<br>
The antibodies for use in the present invention can be formulated according to known<br>
methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, wherein an antibody for use in the invention (including any functional fragment thereof) is combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle.  Suitable vehicles and their formulation are described, for example, in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (18th ed., Alfonso R. Gennaro, Ed., Easton, Pa.: Mack Pub. Co., 1990). In order to form a pharmaceutically acceptable composition suitable for effective administration, such compositions will contain an effective amount of one or more of the antibodies for use in the present invention, together with a suitable amount of carrier vehicle. Preferred antibodies or antigen-binding regions of the invention for use as a diagnostic compound comprise a variable heavy chain sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106 and/or a variable light chain sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58,59, 60,109 and 110.<br>
Preparations may be suitably formulated to give controlled-release of the active compound. Controlled-release preparations may be achieved through the use of polymers to complex or absorb anti-CD38 antibody. The controlled delivery may be exercised by selecting appropriate macromolecules (for example polyesters, polyamino acids, polyvinyl, pyrrolidone, ethylenevinyl-acetate, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, or protamine, sulfate) and the<br><br>
concentration of macromolecules as well as the methods of incorporation in order to control release. Another possible method to control the duration of action by controlled release preparations is to incorporate anti-CD38 antibody into particles of a polymeric material such as polyesters, polyamino acids, hydrogels, poly(lactic acid) or ethylene vinylacetate copolymers. Alternatively, instead of incorporating these agents into polymeric particles, it is possible to entrap these materials in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatine-microcapsules and poly(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, or in colloidal drug delivery systems, for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nanoparticles, and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980).<br>
The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br><br>
The invention further is understood by reference to the following working examples, which are intended to illustrate and, hence, not limit the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Cell-lines<br>
The following cell-lines were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), the German Collection of Microorganisms (DSMZ) or the American Type Culture collection (ATCC): hybridoma cell line producing the CD38 mouse IgGl monoclonal antibody OKT10 (ECACC, #87021903), Jurkat cells (DSMZ, ACC282), LP-1 (DSMZ, ACC41), RPMI8226 (ATCC, CCL-155), HEK293 (ATCC, CRL-1573), CHO-K1 (ATCC, CRL-61), Raji (ATCC, CCL-86), and OPM2 (DSMZ, ACC50).<br>
Cells and culture-conditions<br>
All cells were cultured under standardized conditions at 37°C and 5% COa in a humidified incubator. The cell-lines LP-1, RPMI8226, Jurkat and Raji were cultured in RPMI1640 (Pan biotech GmbH, #P04-16500) supplemented with 10 % PCS (PAN biotech GmbH, #P30-3302), 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin (Gibco, #15140-122) and 2 mM glutamine (Gibco, #25030-024) and, in case of Jurkat- and Raji-cells, additionally 10 mM Hepes (Pan biotech GmbH, #P05-01100) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Pan biotech GmbH, # P04-43100) had to be added.<br>
CHO-K1 and HEK293 were grown in DMEM (Gibco, #10938-025) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% PCS. Stable CD38 CHO-K1 transfectants were maintained in the presence of G418 (PAA GmbH, PI 1-012) whereas for HEK293 the addition of ImM sodium-pyruvate was essential. After transient transfection of HEK293 the 10% PCS was replaced by Ultra low IgG PCS (Invitrogen, #16250-078). The cell-line OKT10 was cultured in IDMEM (Gibco, #31980-022), supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 20 % PCS.<br><br>
Preparation of single cell suspensions from peripheral blood<br>
All blood samples were taken after informed consent. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Histopaque®-1077 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions from healthy donors. Red blood cells were depleted from these cell suspensions by incubation in ACK Lysis Buffer (0.15 M NH4C1,10 mM KHC03&gt; 0.1 M EDTA) for 5 min at RT or a commercial derivative (Bioscience, #00-4333). Cells were washed twice with PBS and then further processed for flow cytometry or ADCC (see below).<br>
Flow cytometry ("FACS")<br>
All stainings were performed in round bottom 96-well culture plates (Nalge Nunc) with 2 x 10s cells per well. Cells were incubated with Fab or IgG antibodies at the indicated concentrations in 50 nl FACS buffer (PBS, 3% PCS, 0.02% NaN3) for 40 min at 4°C. Cells were washed twice and then incubated with R-Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated goat-anti-human or goat-anti-mouse IgG (H+L) F(ab')2 (Jackson Immuno Research), diluted 1:200 in FACS buffer, for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were again washed, resuspended in 0.3 ml FACS buffer and then analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA).<br>
For FACS based Scatchard analyses RPMI8226 cells were stained with at 12 different dilutions (1:2") starting at 12.5 ng/ml (IgG) final concentration. At least two independent measurements were used for each concentration and KD values extrapolated from median fluorescence intensities according to Chamow et al. (1994).<br>
Surface plasmon resonance<br>
The kinetic constants kon and kotr were determined with serial dilutions of the respective Fab binding to covalently immobilized CD38-Fc fusion protein using the BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). For covalent antigen immobilization standard EDC-NHS amine coupling chemistry was used. For direct coupling of CD38 Fc-fusion protein CMS senor chips (Biacore) were coated with -600-700 RU in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5. For the reference flow cell a respective amount of HSA (human serum albumin) was used. Kinetic measurements were done in PBS (136 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KC1, l0mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2P04 pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 20µl/min using Fab concentration range from 1.5-500 nM. Injection time for each<br><br>
concentration was 1 min, followed by 2 min dissociation phase. For regeneration 5 ul lOmM HC1 was used. All sensograms were fitted locally using BIA evaluation software 3.1 (Biacore).<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Antibody Generation from HuCAL Libraries<br>
For the generation of therapeutic antibodies against CD38, selections with the MorphoSys HuCAL GOLD® phage display library were carried out. HuCAL GOLD* is a Fab library based on the HuCAL* concept (Knappik et al., 2000; Krebs et al., 2001), in which all six CDRs are diversified, and which employs the CysDisplay™ technology for linking Fab fragments to the phage surface (Lfthning, 2001). A. Phagemid rescue, phage amplification and purification<br>
HuCAL GOLD® phagemid library was amplified in 2 x TY medium containing 34 ug/ml chloramphenicol and 1 % glucose (2 x TY-CG). After helper phage infection (VCSM13) at an OD600 of 0.5 (30 min at 37°C without shaking; 30 min at 37°C shaking at 250 rpm), cells were spun down (4120 g; 5 min; 4°C), resuspended in 2 x TY / 34 ug/ml chloramphenicol / 50 ug/ml kanamycin and grown overnight at 22°C. Phages were PEG-precipitated from the supernatant, resuspended in PBS / 20 % glycerol and stored at -80°C. Phage amplification between two panning rounds was conducted as follows: mid-log phase TGI cells were infected with eluted phages and plated onto LB-agar supplemented with 1 % of glucose and 34 ug/ml of chloramphenicol (LB-CG). After overnight incubation at 30°C, colonies were scraped off, adjusted to an OD600 of 0.5 and helper phage added as described above.<br>
B. Pannings with HuCAL GOLD*<br>
For the selections HuCAL GOLD* antibody-phages were divided into three pools corresponding to different VH master genes (pool 1: VH1/5XK, pool 2: VH3 ΛK, pool 3: VH2/4/6 toe). These pools were individually subjected to 3 rounds of whole cell panning on CD38-expressing CHO-<br><br>
Kl cells followed by pH-elution and a post-adsorption step on CD38-negative CHO-Kl-cells for depletion of irrelevant antibody-phages. Finally, the remaining antibody phages were used to infect E. coli TGI cells. After centrifugation the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 2 x TY medium, plated on agar plates and incubated overnight at 30°C. The selected clones were then scraped from the plates, phages were rescued and amplified. The second and the third round of selections were performed as the initial one.<br>
The Fab encoding inserts of the selected HuCAL GOLD* phages were subcloned into the expression vector pMORPHx9_Fab_FS (Rauchenberger et al., 2003) to facilitate rapid expression of soluble Fab. The DNA of the selected clones was digested with Xbal and EcoRI thereby cutting out the Fab encoding insert (ompA-VLCL and phoA-Fd), and cloned into the Xbal / EcoRI cut vector pMORPHx9_Fab_FS. Fab expressed in this vector carry two C-terminal tags (FLAG™ and Strep-tag* II) for detection and purification.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Biological assays<br>
Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity was measured according to a published protocol based on flow-cytometry analysis (Naundorf et al., 2002) as follows:<br>
ADCC:<br>
For ADCC measurements, target cells (T) were adjusted to 2.0E+05 cells/ml and labeled with 100 ng/ml Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, C-3099) in RPMI1640 medium (Pan biotech GmbH) for 2 minutes at room temperature. Residual calcein was removed by 3 washing steps in RPMI1640 medium. In parallel PBMC were prepared as source for (natural killer) effector cells (E), adjusted to l.OE+07 and mixed with the labeled target cells to yield a final E:T-ratio of 50:1 or less, depending on the assay conditions. Cells were washed once and the cell-mix resuspended<br><br>
in 200 µl RPMI1640 medium containing the respective antibody at different dilutions. The plate<br>
was incubated for 4 hrs under standardized conditions at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Prior to FACS analysis cells were labeled with propidium-iodide (PI) and analyzed by flow-cytometry (Becton-Oickinson). Between 50.000 and 150.000 events were counted for each assay.<br>
The following equation gave rise to the killing activity [in %]:<br>
EDA<br>
xlOO<br>
ELA + EDA<br>
with EDA = events dead cells (calcein + PI stained cells), and ELA = events living cells (calcein stained cells)<br>
CDC:<br>
For CDC measurements, 5.0E+04 CD38 CHO-K1 transfectants were added to a microtiter well plate (Nunc) together with a 1:4 dilution of human serum (Sigma, #8-1764) and the respective antibody. All reagents and cells were diluted in RPMI1640 medium (Pan biotech GmbH) supplemented with 10% FCS. The reaction-mix was incubated for 2 hrs under standardized conditions at 37°C and 5% CC&gt;2 in a humidified incubator. As negative controls served either heat-inactivated complement or CD38-transfectants without antibody. Cells were labeled with PI and subjected to FACS-analysis.<br>
In total 5000 events were counted and the number of dead cells at different antibody<br>
concentrations used for the determination of EC50 values. The following equation gave rise to the killing activity [in %]:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with EDC = events dead cells (PI stained cells), and<br><br>
ELC = events living cells (unstained)<br>
Cytotoxicity values from a total of 12 different antibody-dilutions (l:2n) in triplicates<br>
were used in ADCC and duplicates in CDC for each antibody in order obtain EC-50 values with a standard analysis software (PRISM®, Graph Pad Software).<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Generation of stable CD38-transfectants and CD38 Fc-fusion proteins<br>
In order to generate CD38 protein for panning and screening two different expression systems had to be established. The first strategy included the generation of CD38-Fc-fusion protein, which was purified from supernatants after transient transfection of HEK293 cells. The second strategy involved the generation of a stable CHO-K1 -cell line for high CD38 surface expression to be used for selection of antibody-phages via whole cell panning.<br>
As an initial step Jurkat cells (DSMZ ACC282) were used for the generation of cDNA (Invitrogen) followed by amplification of the entire CD38-coding sequence using primers complementary to the first 7 and the last 9 codons of CD38, respectively (primer MTE001 &amp; MTE002rev; Table 4). Sequence analysis of the CD38-insert confirmed the published amino acid sequence by Jackson et al. (1990) except for position 49 which revealed a glutamine instead of a tyrosine as described by Nata et al. (1997). For introduction of restriction endonuclease sites and cloning into different derivatives of expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Stratagene), the purified PCR-product served as a template for the re-amplification of the entire gene (primers MTE006 &amp; MTE007rev, Table 4) or a part (primers MTE004 &amp; MTE009rev, Table 4) of it. In the latter case a fragment encoding for the extracellular domain (aa 45 to 300) was amplified and cloned in frame between a human Vkappa leader sequence and a human Fc-gamma 1 sequence. This vector served as expression vector for the generation of soluble CD38-Fc fusion-protein. Another pcDNA3.1-derivative without leader-sequence was used for insertion of the CD38 full-length<br><br>
gene. In this case a stop codon in front of the Fc-coding region and the missing leader-sequence gave rise to CD38-surface expression. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the Fc-fusion protein vector for generation of soluble CDS 8 Fc-fusion protein and, in case of the full-length derivative, CHO-Kl-cells were transfected for the generation of a stable CD38-expressing cell line.<br>
Table 4:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
* leading to a stop codon (TGA) in the sense orientation.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Cloning, expression and purification of HuCAL® IgGl:<br>
In order to express full length IgG, variable domain fragments of heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) were subcloned from Fab expression vectors into appropriate pMORPH®_h!g vectors (see Figures 7 to 9). Restriction endonuclease pairs BlpI/Mfel (insert-preparation) and BlpI/EcoRI (vector-preparation) were used for subcloning of the VH domain fragment into pMORPH®_hIgGl. Enzyme-pairs EcoRV/Hpal (lambda-insert) and EcoRV/BsiWI (kappa-insert) were used for subcloning of the VL domain fragment into the respective pMORPH®_hIgK_l or pMORPH®_h_Igλ_l vectors. Resulting IgG constructs were expressed<br><br>
in HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) by transient transfection using standard calcium phosphate -DNA coprecipitation technique.<br>
IgGs were purified from cell culture supematants by affinity chromatography via Protein A Sepharose column. Further down stream processing included a buffer exchange by gel filtration and sterile filtration of purified IgG. Quality control revealed a purity of &gt;90 % by reducing SDS-PAGE and &gt;90 % monomeric IgG as determined by analytical size exclusion chromatography. The endotoxin content of the material was determined by a kinetic LAL based assay (Cambrex European Endotoxin Testing Service, Belgium).<br>
EXAMPLE 5: Generation and production of chimeric OKT10 (chOKTIO; SEQ ID NOS:<br>
72 and 73)<br>
For the construction of chOKTlO the mouse VH and VL regions were amplified by PCR using cDNA prepared from the murine OKT10 hybridoma cell line (ECACC #87021903). A set of primers was used as published (Dattamajumdar et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 1994). PCR products were used for Topo-cloning (Invitrogen; pCRII-vector) and single colonies subjected to sequence analysis (Ml3 reverse primer) which revealed two different kappa light chain sequences and one heavy chain sequence. According to sequence alignments (EMBL-nucleotide sequence database) and literature (Krebber et al, 1997) one of the kappa-sequence belongs to the intrinsic repertoire of the tumor cell fusion partner X63Ag8.653 and hence does not belong to OKT10 antibody. Therefore, only the new kappa sequence and the single VH-fragment was used for further cloning. Both fragments were reamplified for the addition of restriction endonuclease sites followed by cloning into the respective pMORPH® IgG 1-expression vectors. The sequences for the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 72) and light chain (SEQ ID NO: 73) are given in Fig. 6. HEK293<br><br>
cells were transfected transiently and the supernatant analyzed in FACS for the chimeric OKT10 antibody binding to the CD38 over-expressing Raji cell line (ATCC).<br>
Example 6: Cross reactivity analysis by FACS (MOR 03087 and MOR 03088)<br>
1. Materials and Methods:<br>
Figures 11 and 12 show FACS analyses of lymphocytes and erythrocytes: EDTA-treated blood samples were obtained from healthy humans (after obtaining informed consent) and from non human primates (Rhesus, Cynomolgus and Marmoset) and were subjected to density gradient centrifugation using the Histopaque cell separation system according to the instructions of the supplier (Sigma). For FACS-analysis, cells from the interphase (PBMC-fraction) and pellet (Erythrocyte-fraction) were incubated with anti-CD38 HuCAL® antibodies in different formats<br>
An overview of cross reactivity profiles of different anti CD38 antibodies is shown in Figure 13<br>
2. Summary and conclusion:<br>
The results show that among all CD38 antibodies only MOR03087 and MOR03088 showed cross-reactivity to marmoset PBMCs. Surprisingly, CD38-expression on marmoset erythrocytes is almost not detectable as compared to the strong expression on cynomolgus and rhesus erythrocytes. Thus, the CD38 expression on marmoset erythrocytes and PBMCs is more reflecting the human situation, where CD38 expression is low on erythrocytes and moderate to high on PBMCs. Marmoset is therefore considered to be suited as a model to study toxicity of molecules binding to CD38.<br><br>
Based on the above study, it was decided to further optimize the binders MOR 03087 and MOR 03088, as described elsewhere in the specification, see e.g. paragraph relating to "Antibodies for use in the invention". A person skilled in the art would expect that also the derivative antibodies of the parentals would show a comparable cross reactivity profile.<br>
