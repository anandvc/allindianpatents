				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of Agglomerated flavoured tea.<br>
The tea plant belongs to the genius camellia [Camellia sinensis] cultivated in East Asian countries viz., China, Burma, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, etc. Basically, two varieties of the tea plant are recognised viz., [1] The Chinese variety Sinesis [2] The Assamese variety Assamica.<br>
Tea is the most widely used ancient beverage in the world. The concept of flavouring tea is an age-old tradition. Tea is generally flavoured with natural and nature identical flavours. Although conventional teas are popular all over the world, non-conventional teas (instant, decaffeinated and flavoured teas) are in great demand. There is a steady increase in market for scented black tea, scented black decaffeinated teas, spiced teas, spiced decaffeinated, China jasmine tea and Earl grey tea in U.K., U.S.A., Middle Eastern countries and Japan.<br>
Agglomerated flavoured tea is a convenience product where the flavour is incorporated in high concentration to the tea dust. This product can be blended with normal teas to get a flavour concentration required at the consumer end. This product has long shelf life and has an advantage of flavour completely releasing into the brew.<br>
This process involves the use of black tea dust, encapsulated Bergamot flavour and flavour emulsion as ingredients. No other preservative or colour is used in this process. The agglomerated flavoured tea obtained remains stable for 3 months at accelerated conditions [40°C, 65% RH].<br><br>
From literature and patent search, it is seen that no process for the preparation of agglomerated flavoured tea formulation has been reported.<br>
The patent search has revealed agglomeration techniques used in some of the food materials are given below<br>
Agglomeration tendency of gums like locust bean gum , carboxy methyl cellulose, sodium alginate and kappa carrageenan during top spray fluodized bed coating has been reported (ISSN : 0023-6438 lebens mittil : Wissenschaft - und - Technologie, 31,6 ( c ), 576-584, 1998 ).<br>
Carbohydrate coatings (pectin, gum ghatti, starch and resistant starch-C ) on absorption of lipid by potato chips during frying has been useful in producing chips with  low lipid  content  (  ISSN  :  04191-4217,  Dissertation  abstracts-international - B 56, 12 ( C ) 6485,1996 ).<br>
Coating of fruits with a mixture of lecithin, methyl anthranilite is done to minimise oxidational deterioration and controls microorganisms (Canadian patent PN : 890874 ( C ) J. Fruits-vegetables and nuts, 1972 ).<br>
Agglomeration techniques used in Alitame in chewing gums is reported ( US : 458989, Wrigley jr II, Chicago USA 1991).<br>
The above mentioned references deal with agglomeration techniques for gums and coating techniques for fruits and carbohydrates, but not for agglomeration of flavoured teas.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to develop a process for the production of agglomerated flavoured tea.<br>
The objective is to develop flavoured tea using Bergamot flavour<br>
Another objective of the  present  invention  is to  optimise  the  level<br>
incorporation of Bergamot flavour<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to standardize the method of<br>
incorporation of Bergamot flavour<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to standardize Optimum<br>
conditions for bench scale and 1 kg level samples of flavoured tea.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is Packaging, storage stability of<br>
the product.<br>
Another  objective  of  the   present   invention   is   to   Physico-chemical<br>
characteristics of the product.<br>
Accordingly a process for the production of agglomerated flavoured tea, which comprises ,<br>
a.	selecting the tea dust of specific particle size of 20-25 BS mesh,<br>
b.	moisturising the tea dust by adding water in 15-20% at 26-28°C<br>
temperature,<br>
c.	drying the tea using Vibro Fluidized Bed Drier at a temperature of   125 to<br>
140°C  for 10 minutes,<br>
d.	flavouring of pre-conditioned tea using 16-20g of encapsulated bergamot<br>
flavour powder in sigma mixer for 1-2 minutes time,<br><br>
e.	binding of the flavour on the tea mix is achieved by spraying the emulsion<br>
mechanically with a flow rate of 40 - 50ml/min,<br>
f.	agglomerating of sprayed material is brought by passing through Vibro<br>
Fluidized Bed Drier for a period of 15 to 20 minutes at 125°C to 140°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the, agglomerated flavoured tea obtained has particle size 700 to 800 microns, moisture 5 to 6%.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the, charecteristic of the agglomerated tea is stable, free flowing, instantising and complete flavour releaser into the tea brew.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the, agglomerated tea powder has shelf - life for 6 month stored in aluminium foil pouches at 26 to 28°C temperature conditions and can be blended with normal tea to get a required flavour concentration .<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the, drying of moisturised tea in VFBD is carried out at preferable temperature 125 - 130°C for 5 to 10 minutes. In an embodiment of the present invention the, flavouring of pre-conditioned tea is carried out using 18-20% of bergamot flavour powder in sigma mixer for 1 -2 minutes.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the, binding of flavour powder in the tea mix is achieved by spraying 18-20% of the emulsion mechanically with a preferable flow rate of 40-42ml/min.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the, agglomeration of binder sprayed material is carried out in VFBD for a preferable period of 15-20 minutes at 125-140°C temperature.<br>
Flow chart for the preparation of agglomerated flavoured tea<br>
(Diagram Removed)<br>
The novelty of the present invention comprises<br>
[1] Stabilised flavoured tea is obtained in this new method of incorporation of<br>
flavour powder. [2] Coating of flavour powder at 30 to 40% level on the tea dust resulting in<br>
3.0 to 4.0% volatile oil in the final product is achieved. [3] Preconditioning of tea is carried out to increase the surface area of tea matrix wherein it helps in altering density required to match with flavour powder in order to avoid the density separation of both during prewparation of agglomerated tea.<br>
[4] The efficient binding of flavour powder on tea matrix at 26-28°C temperature is brought out by spraying of emulsion followed by agglomeration technique at 125-140°C temperature in VFBD . The following examples are given by way of illustrations of this new invention:<br>
Example 1:<br>
A 100 g of tea dust was mixed with 20ml water and dried in oven at 110°C for 10 min. The pre-conditioned tea was mixed with 20g encapsulated Bergamot flavour powder in pestle and mortar for 2 min. This mixture was spread in tray in thin layer and 20ml emulsion was sprayed using a hand sprayer. At the end gentle hopping was given to separate the granules. The granules were dried in oven at 110°C for 10 min to bring down the moisture level to 5-8%. The dried material was passed through 16(BS) mesh to break the lumps. Further the above sieved material was passed through 100 mesh [BS] to obtain agglomerated flavoured tea on top and uncoated flavour powder in the collector.<br>
The final weight of the agglomerated tea obtained was 100 g (83.25%) along with 18 g lumps (15%). There was 2 g (1.7%) working loss during the preparation of agglomerated flavoured tea. The optimum conditions for processing agglomerated flavoured tea is given in the flow chart:<br>
Example 2 :<br>
A 714 g of tea dust was mixed with 143 ml of water in a rotating drum for 3 min. Material was removed and passed on to VFBD for drying and completed in single pass of inlet temperature 125°C and outlet temperature 50°C.The dried pre - conditioned tea was mixed with 286 g of flavour powder in Sigma mixer for 1 min. Then the mixture was passed through a newly fabricated ribbon mixer (20 kg/h capacity) with flow rate of 333 g/min by adjusting the feed rate. Spray nozzle was fixed towards the end of the mixer, so that little mixing was given to the material before it falls into VFBD. 280 ml of emulsion was sprayed through spray nozzle at the rate of 40 ml/min on to the mixture, and further dried in VFBD for 15 min in 3 passes. Then the material was passed through granulator with 16 BS for 1 min. Final passing through 100 BS mesh yielded agglomerated flavoured tea 83% (top) and uncoated flavour 13.0% (bottom).<br><br>
