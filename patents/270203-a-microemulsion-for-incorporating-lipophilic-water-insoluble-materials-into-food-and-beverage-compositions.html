CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[001]	The present application relates to and claims priority from US Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/727,122, filed October 14, 2005, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present application relates to microemulsions which are effective for<br>
incorporating water-insoluble components into aqueous-based food and beverage<br>
compositions or water-soluble components into lipid-based food compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	The formulation of food and beverage products, particularly aqueous-based<br>
food and beverage products, can be difficult. For example, it is frequently necessary<br>
to incorporate water immiscible components, such as colors, flavors, nutrients, '<br>
nutraceuticals, therapeutic agents, or antioxidants, into compositions which are<br>
primarily aqueous based. The difficulty of this task is increased by the fact that the<br>
compositions need to be formulated such that they are esthetically pleasing to the<br>
consumer. For example, it is frequently necessary to incorporate a water-insoluble<br>
material into an aqueous beverage while still maintaining the optical clarity of the<br>
beverage. These compositions also need to exhibit long-term shelf stability under<br>
typical food and beverage shipping, storage and use conditions.<br>
[0004]	One way that the industry has attempted to satisfy these conflicting<br>
requirements is to incorporate the water immiscible materials using microemulsions.<br>
A microemulsion is a dispersion of two immiscible liquids (one liquid phase being<br><br>
"dispersed" and the other being "continuous") in which the individual droplets of the<br>
dispersed phase have an average radius less than about one-quarter, the wavelength of<br>
light. Such microemulsions have also been termed "nanoemulsions". Typically, in a<br>
microemulsion, the dispersed phase droplets have a radius of less than about 1400 A,<br>
and preferably on the order of about 100 to about 500 A. The basic theory of<br>
microemulsions is more fully described in Rosano, Journal of the Society of Cosmetic<br>
Chemists, 25; 609-619 (November, 1974), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[ooosj	Microemulsions can be difficult to formulate, frequently requiring the use of<br>
co-solvents, such as ethanol or propylene glycol. These co-solvents can lead to off-<br>
flavors in the final product. Further, the formation of microemulsions frequently<br>
requires some rather stressful processing conditions, such as high pressure<br>
homogenization, which require specialized equipment and can increase the cost of the<br>
final product.<br>
[0006]	It therefore would be useful to have a procedure for formulating<br>
microemulsions, using relatively low levels of food grade emulsifiers, which allow<br>
the incorporation of water-immiscible components into aqueous-based food and<br>
beverage compositions without requiring the use of such co-solvents and relatively<br>
extreme processing conditions.<br>
[0007]	The prior art describes the formation of microemulsions, as well as the use of<br>
microemulsions formed by conventional processes for the incorporation of materials<br>
into food and beverage products,<br>
[0008]	-U.S. Patent 4,146,499, Rosano, issued March 27, 1979, describes an oil-in-<br>
water microemulsion which utilizes a high/low HLB surfactant mixture for forming<br>
the emulsion. The patent does not teach or suggest use of a ternary (high/low/medium<br>
HLB) surfactant system in forming the emulsion.<br><br>
[0009]	U.S. Patent 4,752,481, Dokuzovic, issued June 21, 1988, describes a flavored<br>
chewing gum product which includes a chewing gum base, a sweetener, and a flavor-<br>
containing emulsion. The emulsion comprises 19 to 59% of a flavoring oil, 1 to 5% of<br>
an emulsifier having an HLB of from about 1.6 to about 7.0, and an alkyl polyol (for<br>
example, glycerin or polyethylene glycol).<br>
[0010]	" U.S. Patent 4,835,002, Wolf et al., issued May 30, 1989, describes a<br>
microemulsion of an edible essential oil (such as citrus oil) in a water/alcohol matrix.<br>
The composition comprises water, the essential oil, alcohol and a surfactant. The<br>
surfactant component utilized must include a high HLB surfactant, although a mixture<br>
of high HLB and low HLB surfactants can also included. There is no disclosure of a<br>
ternary surfactant emulsifier system for use in forming the emulsion.<br>
[0011]	U.S. Patent 5,320,863, Chung et al, issued June 14, 1994, describes<br>
microemulsions used to deliver high concentrations of flavor or fragrance oils. The<br>
compositions are said to exhibit high stability even in the absence of lower alcohols.<br>
The compositions include a nonionic surfactant (generally not edible or food grade);<br>
no discussion of HLB criticality is provided. There is no disclosure or suggestion to<br>
combine high, low and medium HLB surfactants into a ternary emulsifying system.<br>
[0012]	U.S. Patent 5,447,729, Belenduik et al, issued September 5, 1995, describes a<br>
particulate pharmaceutical composition wherein a pharmaceutical active material may<br>
be incorporated into particles in the form of a microemulsion. The outer layers of the<br>
particles have hydrophobic/lipophilic interfaces between them. The disclosed<br>
compositions can include polysorbate 80 or glycerol monooleate as an emulsifier.<br>
There is no teaching in the patent of a ternary surfactant emulsifier system.<br>
[0013]	U.S. Patent 5,948,825, Takahashi et al., issued September 7, 1999, describes<br>
water-in-oil emulsions of hard-to-absorb pharmaceutical agents for use in topical or<br><br>
oral administration. There is no disclosure or suggestion of a ternary surfactant<br>
emulsifier system. The emulsifiers disclosed in the '825 patent can include a mixture<br>
of two types of nonionic surfactants, one having an HLB of from 10 to 20, and the<br>
other having an HLB from 3 to 7.<br>
[0014]	U.S. Patent 6,048,566, Behnam et al., issued April 11, 2000, describes a<br>
nonalcoholic, clear beverage which incorporates from 10 to 500 mg/1 of ubiquinone<br>
Q10, together with a polysorbate stabilizer.<br>
[0015]	U.S. Patent 6,077,559, Logan et al., issued June 20, 2000, relates to flavored<br>
vinegars which are based on the inclusion of specifically defined microemulsions. The<br>
oil-in-vinegar microemulsions comprise from 20% to 70% vinegar, 5% to 35%<br>
ethanol, 0.1% to 5% of a flavor material, and 0.5% to 5% of a surfactant. The<br>
surfactants utilized are high HLB surfactants; they can also include a small amount of<br>
low HLB (4 to 9) surfactant. There is no disclosure of a ternary surfactant emulsifier<br>
system in the '559 patent.<br>
[0016|	U.S. Patent 6,146,672, Gonzalez et al., issued November 14, 2000, relates to<br>
spreadable water-in-oil emulsions which are used as fillings in pastry products,<br>
particularly frozen pastries. The fillings are said to exhibit enhanced shelf-life and<br>
stability. The described emulsions include a mixture of high and low HLB<br>
emulsifiers. Although the '672 patent describes a mixture of high and low HLB<br>
surfactants, it does not disclose or suggest the ternary surfactant emulsifier system<br>
which is utilized in the present invention. Further, the '672 patent does not teach<br>
microemulsions or the use of an emulsion to incorporate water-insoluble materials<br>
into food products.<br>
[0017]	U.S. Patent 6,303,662, Nagahama et al., issued October 16, 2001, describes<br>
microemulsions used in the delivery of fat-soluble drugs. The disclosed compositions<br><br>
require a high polarity oil, a low polarity oil, a polyglycerol mono fatty acid ester, and<br>
a water-soluble polyhydric alcohol. There is no disclosure of a ternary surfactant<br>
emulsifier system.<br>

lowering agents. The compositions can include a mixture of a surfactant having an<br>
HLB of from 6 to 9, a surfactant having an HLB of from 2 to 6, and a surfactant<br>
having an HLB of from 9 to 22. Although this patent does teach a ternary emulsifier<br>
system, the product formed is not a microemulsion, but rather a mesophase-stabilized<br>
emulsion (the mesophase does not have separate oil and water phases). The disclosed<br>
compositions are said to provide mouth feel and texture benefits to food products. The<br>
emulsion particles formed in the '482 patent are relatively large (i.e., from about 2 to<br>
about 10 μm).<br>
[0019]	U.S. Patent 6,426,078, Bauer et al., issued July 30, 2002, describes oil-in-<br>

acid emulsifier (for example, triglycerol monolaurate, triglycerol monocaproate or<br>
triglycerol monocaprylate), 1% to 20% of a lipophilic substance (for example, beta-<br>
carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E), and water. These compositions are said to be<br>
useful in foods, cosmetics or pharmaceuticals for incorporating non-water-soluble<br>
(lipophilic) substances. There is no disclosure of a ternary surfactant emulsifier<br>
system for forming the microemulsion.<br>

microemulsion flavor delivery system in the form of an oil-in-alcohol composition.<br>
These compositions require the use of alcohols which generally are not included in<br><br>
typical food or beverage formulations. Further, the '253 patent does not teach or<br>
suggest a ternary surfactant emulsifier system.<br>
[0021]	U.S. Patent 6,509,044, Van Den Braak et al., issued January 21, 2003,<br>
describes microemulsions of beta-carotene. These microemulsions are said to be<br>
based on an emulsifier system which preferably is a binary surfactant system, but can<br>
also be a ternary system (although there are no examples of a ternary system<br>
provided). It is taught that the fatty acid profiles of the emulsifiers are matched with<br>
the fatty acid profiles of the oily ingredient to be incorporated into the composition.<br>
There is no teaching in the '044 patent of a ternary high/low/medium HLB surfactant<br>
emulsifier system for use in forming the microemulsion.<br>
[0022]	U.S. Patent 6,774,247, Behnam, issued August 10, 2004, relates to aqueous<br>
ascorbic acid solutions. These solutions are said to contain an excess of an emulsifier<br>
having an HLB of from about 9 to about 18, such as polysorbate 80. There is no<br>
suggestion in the '247 patent to utilize a ternary surfactant emulsifier system.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025]	The present invention relates to microemulsions used to incorporate lipophilic<br>
water-insoluble materials into food and beverage compositions, comprising:<br>
(a)	an oil phase comprising said water-insoluble material and a low HLB<br>
emulsifierhaving an HLB of from about 1 to about 5;<br>
(b)	an aqueous phase; and<br>
(c)	a food grade emulsifier system comprising:<br>
(i) an emulsifier having an HLB of from about 9 to about 17; and<br>
(ii) an emulsifier having an HLB of from about 6 to about 8;<br>
wherein said oil phase is dispersed as particles having an average diameter of less<br>
than about 300 nm, within said aqueous phase.<br>
[0026] The present invention also encompasses food compositions and beverage<br>
compositions which incorporate the microemulsions defined above.<br>
[0027] The present invention also relates to a method for preparing the microemulsions<br>
defined above, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	mixing the lipophilic water-insoluble components with the low HLB<br>
emulsifier to form the oil phase;<br>
(b)	mixing the emulsifier system into the oil phase; and<br><br>
(c) adding the aqueous phase into the product of step (b) and mixing to form the<br>
microemulsion.<br>
[0028] Finally, the present invention relates to water-in-oil microemulsions using the<br>
ternary emulsifier system described herein, and concentrates used for making oil-in-<br>
water and water-in-oil microemulsions.<br>
[0029] The microemulsions of the present invention provide several advantages over<br>
conventional compositions. Specifically, the microemulsions of the present invention<br>
can carry effective levels of difficult-to-disperse components, such as carotenoids, in<br>
optically transparent beverages. The compositions of the present invention are<br>
sufficiently stable under normal soft drink transport and storage conditions. The taste<br>
of the food and beverage products of the present invention is very acceptable.<br>
[0030] The physical and optical characteristics of the emulsions are controllable by<br>
selection of appropriate emulsifiers and the heating temperature used, as well as the<br>
order of addition of the components. Importantly, the microemulsions of the present<br>
invention form essentially spontaneously under normal stirring, without requiring<br>
extreme processing conditions, such as high-pressure homogenization. Finally, the<br>
microemulsions of the present invention can demonstrate improved bioavailability of<br>
the dispersed elements, such as carotenoids.<br>
[0031] With the present invention it is also possible to prepare oil-in-water<br>
microemulsions containing omega-3 fatty acids or their esters that are highly<br>
susceptible to oxidation (or other acids/esters which are highly susceptible to<br>
oxidation). It is observed that such components exhibit higher oxidative stability in<br>
microemulsions of the present invention than in conventional emulsions.<br>
[0032] All patents and publications listed in the present application are intended to be<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
[0033] All ratios and proportions described in this application are intended to be "by<br>
weight," unless otherwise specified.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0034]	The present invention provides for microemulsions which are easily formed<br>
and which allow for the incorporation of water immiscible components into aqueous-<br>
based food and beverage compositions. Similarly, the microemulsions can be used to<br>
incorporate water-soluble materials into fat-based products. For example, water-<br>
soluble natural colorants, flavors, vitamins, salts or antioxidants can be incorporated<br>
into fat-based products like coating layers on a snack bar, frosting, chocolate,<br>
margarine, fat spread or confectionary products.<br>
[0035]	The water-insoluble components which may be incorporated into the food and<br>
beverage compositions of the present invention encompass any materials which are<br>
desirably incorporated into a food or beverage product, but which are insoluble in or<br>
immiscible with an aqueous-based composition. Such materials generally are i<br>
lipophilic. Examples of such materials include certain colorants, flavorants, nutrients,<br>
nutraceuticals, therapeutic agents, antioxidants, extracts of natural components (such<br>
as plants, roots, leaves, flowers, etc.), medicaments, preservatives, and mixtures of<br>
these materials. Specific examples of such materials which are frequently used in food<br>
and beverage compositions include the following: carotenoids and their derivatives<br>
(such as beta-carotene, apocarotenal, lutein, lutein ester, lycopene, zeaxanthin,<br>
crocetin, astaxanthin), essential oils, edible oils, fatty acids, proteins and peptides,<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids and their esters, vitamin A and its derivatives, vitamin E<br>
and its derivatives, vitamin D and its derivatives, vitamin K and its derivatives,<br>
colorants, flavorants, nutrients, nutraceuticals, therapeutic agents, antioxidants,<br><br>
extracts of natural components (such as plants, roots, leaves, flowers, seeds, etc.),<br>
medicaments, preservatives, lipoic acid, phytosterins, quercetin, phytosterols and their<br>
esters, co-enzyme Q10 (ubidecarone), plant isoflavones (such as genistein,<br>
isogenistein or formononetine), and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0036]	Particularly preferred materials which can be incorporated using the present<br>
invention include, for example, oil-soluble, oil-insoluble or water-soluble food<br>
ingredients, such as food additives, food preservatives, food supplements,<br>
antioxidants, nutraceuticals, cosmoceuticals, plant extracts, medicaments, fatty acids,<br>
peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, natural flavors, synthetic flavors, colorants,<br>
vitamins, and combinations of those materials. The specific microemulsion systems of<br>
beta-carotene, vitamin E, vitamin A materials, such as vitamin A palmitate, vitamin E<br>
acetate, and mixtures of those components are given as examples of this invention.<br>
[0037]	A key element for forming the microemulsions of the present invention is the<br>
ternary surfactant emulsifier system. It is through the use of this ternary system that<br>
microemulsions which provide the benefits of the present invention are formed. This<br>
ternary emulsifier system is a mixture of at least three food grade emulsifiers in the<br>
form of nonionic or anionic surfactants. Nonionic surfactants are preferred. Nonionic<br>
surfactants are well known in the art and are described, for example, in Nonionic<br>
Surfactants: Organic Chemistry, Nico M. van Os (ed.), Marcel Dekker, 1998. At least<br>
one of the emulsifiers has a low HLB (i.e., from about 1 to about 5), at least one of the<br>
emulsifiers has a medium HLB (i.e., from about 6 to about 8), and at least one of the<br>
emulsifiers has a high HLB (i.e., from about 9 to about 17, preferably from about 10<br>
to about 16).<br>
[0038]	The selection of the particular surfactants used in the ternary emulsifier system<br>
depends on the HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) value of such surfactants. The<br><br>
surfactants are selected such that they have the HLB values described above. The<br>
HLB value, and the determination thereof, for surfactants is well known in the art and<br>
is disclosed, for example, by Milton J. Rosen in Surfactants and Interfacial<br>
Phenomena, J. Wiley and Sons, New York, New York, 1978, pages 242-245, or in the<br>
Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd edition, volume 8,1979, at<br>
pages 910-915, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0039]	The following table sets forth the HLB values for a variety of anionic and<br>
nonionic surfactants which can, as examples, be used in the ternary system of the<br>
present invention. The HLB of other non-listed surfactants can be calculated using<br>
procedures well known in the art.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0040]	Any edible oil may be used as the oil phase in the present compositions.<br>
Specifically, the oil phase can'be selected from edible fat/oil sources, such as the oil<br>
extracts from natural components (e.g., plants, flowers, roots, leaves, seeds). For<br>
example, these materials can include carrot seed oil, sesame seed oil, vegetable oil,<br>
soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, or<br>
algae oil. Also included are flavor oils, animal oils (such as fish oils), and dairy<br>
products (such as butterfat). The oil phase can be made from pure oil, mixtures of<br>
different oils, or a mixture of different oil-soluble materials, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0041]	In the oil-in-water microemulsions of the present invention the low HLB<br>
surfactant is present at from about 0.1% to about 5%, particularly about 0.7% to about<br>
1%, of the microemulsion. The high HLB surfactant is present at from about 5% to<br>
about 25%, particularly from about 12% to about 18%, of the microemulsion. The<br>
medium HLB surfactant is present at from about 0.1% to about 5%, particularly from<br>
about 0.5% to about 1.5% of the microemulsion. Particularly preferred low HLB<br>
surfactants include glycerol monooleate, polyglycerol riconoleate, decaglycerol<br>
decaoleate, sucrose erucate and sucrose oleate. Particularly preferred medium HLB<br>
surfactants are polyglycerol esters, such as decaglycerol hexaoleate, and triglycerol<br>
monofatty acids, such as triglycerol monooleate, and sucrose stearate. Particularly<br>
preferred high HLB surfactants include polysorbate 80 or polyoxysorbitan<br>
monolaurate (commercially available as the TWEEN® series of surfactants),<br>
13<br>
I<br><br>
polyglycerol-6 laurate, decaglycerol lauric acid esters, decaglycerol oleic acid esters<br>
and sucrose esters.<br>
[0042]	In one embodiment of the microemulsions of the present invention, the oil<br>
phase is dispersed within the aqueous phase (i.e., an oil-in-water (o/w)<br>
microemulsion). The oil phase is present in particulate form, having a particle size<br>
mean diameter of less than about 300 nm, such as from about 1 to about 300 nm,<br>
preferably from about 1 to about 200 nm. The aqueous phase typically comprises<br>
water and the water-soluble ingredients of the composition, and is present at from<br>
about 50% to about 90%, preferably from about 70% to about 85%, of the<br>
microemulsion. The oil phase generally comprises from about 1% to about 15%,<br>
preferably from about 2% to about 6%, of the microemulsion. Typically, the oil phase<br>
includes the water-insoluble components, as they have been defined above, together<br>
with the low HLB emulsifier component.<br>
[0043]	This oil-in-water microemulsion of the present invention, described above, can<br>
be formulated in a relatively simple manner as follows. The lipophilic water-insoluble<br>
components are mixed with the low HLB emulsifier to form the oil phase. Heat may<br>
be applied, if necessary, to melt the insoluble components and/or the surfactant to<br>
form the oil phase. The emulsifier system, which comprises the high HLB and the<br>
medium HLB emulsifiers is then formed and mixed into the oil phase. The aqueous<br>
phase is then added into the previously made (oil phase/emulsifier) mixture and<br>
further mixed to form the microemulsion. The mixing which is required to form the<br>
microemulsion is relatively easy mixing. Typical equipment which can be used to mix<br>
the components to form the microemulsion include, for example, a magnetic stirrer or<br>
an overhead mixer.<br><br>
[00441	In selecting the emulsifiers utilized in the microemulsions of the present<br>
invention, the following criteria may also be important. The high HLB emulsifier<br>
should have an HLB value between about 9 and about 17, preferably between about<br>
10 and about 16. Without wishing to specify a particular mechanism of action of the<br>
emulsifiers, it may be advantageous to use emulsifiers with relatively bulky head<br>
groups and non-bulky tails selected as to their length so they can form micelles<br>
readily. This is the major emulsifier which confers water-soluble characteristics to the<br>
system. The hydrophilic portions of the molecule repel each other sideways to curve<br>
the interface around the oil side and promote the formation of the oil-in-water<br>
microemulsions. The low HLB emulsifier must be lipophilic and have an HLB value<br>
between about 1 and about 5. This minor emulsifier stays within the oil phase and acts<br>
as a co-surfactant. The emulsifier molecules align their heads and tails in nearly a<br>
perfect way with the oil and the first hydrophilic surfactant to promote formation of<br>
micelles as small as possible. The third emulsifier has a medium HLB between about<br>
6 and about 8. This minor emulsifier can stay in either the water or oil phase and also<br>
acts as a co-surfactant. It is believed that this emulsifier not only further reduces the<br>
interfacial tension between droplets, but also tends to bend the interface to make the<br>
droplets smaller. The combination of the very low interfacial tension, long<br>
hydrophobic tails of the first emulsifier and close packing, and the effect of the co-<br>
surfactants on the curvature of the interface provides a dispersed and stable system of<br>
small droplet size. Examples of food grade surfactants which can be used in the<br>
microemulsions of the present invention include polysorbates (ethoxylated sorbitan<br>
esters), such as polysorbate 80; sorbitan esters, such as sorbitan monostearate; sugar<br>
esters, such as sucrose laurate; polyglycerol esters of fatty acids (from mono-, di-, tri-,<br><br>
and up to deca-, glycerol esters of fatty acids), mono and diglycerides, combinations<br>
of fatty acids and ethoxylated mono-diglycerides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0045]	In addition to the oil-in-water microemulsions described above, the present<br>
invention also encompasses water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions. These are particularly<br>
useful for incorporating water-soluble materials into oil- or fat-based compositions. In<br>
these water-in-oil microemulsions, the aqueous phase is dispersed in the oil phase.<br>
The aqueous phase is present in particulate form, having a particle size mean diameter<br>
of less than about 300 nm, such as from about 1 to about 300 nm, preferably from<br>
about 1 to about 200 nm. The aqueous phase typically comprises water and the water-<br>
soluble ingredients of the composition, and is present at from about 1% to about 15%,<br>
preferably from about 2% to about 6%, of the microemulsion. The oil phase includes<br>
the water-insoluble components and the oily/fatty base, and is generally present at<br>
from about 50% to about 90%, preferably from about 70% to about 85%, of the<br>
microemulsion. In forming these water-in-oil microemulsions, the water-soluble<br>
components are mixed with the high HLB emulsifier to form the aqueous phase. The<br>
low HLB and medium HLB emulsifiers are then mixed together and added to the<br>
aqueous phase. The oil phase is then added to the aqueous phase with mixing, for<br>
example, with an overhead mixer to form the water-in-oil microemulsion. Typically,<br>
in water-in-oil microemulsions, the high HLB surfactant is present at from about 0.1%<br>
to about 5%, the medium HLB surfactant is present at from about 0.1% to about 5%,<br>
and the low HLB surfactant is present at from about 5% to about 30%, of the final<br>
composition.<br>
[0046]	Physical properties of the microemulsion composition, and the final product,<br>
can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of oil or water in the dispersed<br>
phase of the microemulsion.<br><br>
[0047]	Finally, the present invention encompasses concentrate microemulsion<br>
systems which comprise the dispersed phase (including the components) which is<br>
(are) to be incorporated into the final composition) and the three emulsifiers defined<br>
herein; the concentrate does not include the continuous phase. The concentrate is<br>
added to the continuous phase, with stirring, and the microemulsion is formed. Thus,<br>
in a concentrate to form an oil-in-water microemulsion, there will be included an oil-<br>
based phase of selected lipid-soluble ingredients, together with the ternary emulsifier<br>
system, with no aqueous phase. This concentrate is added to an aqueous phase, with<br>
mixing, to form the oil-in-water microemulsion. On the other hand, for a concentrate<br>
to form a water-in-oil microemulsion, there will be an aqueous phase of particular<br>
water-soluble ingredients, together with the ternary emulsifier system, with no oil<br>
phase. Examples of such concentrates are described in this application. These<br>
concentrates that will form oil-in-water microemulsions comprise from about 1% to<br>
about 40% of the disperse phase, and from about 1% to about 10% of the low HLB<br>
emulsifier, from about 1% to about 10% of the medium HLB emulsifier, and from<br>
about 65% to about 95% of the high HLB emulsifier. These concentrates that will<br>
form water-in-oil microemulsions comprise from about 1% to about 40% of the<br>
dispersed phase, and from about 65% to about 95% of the low HLB emulsifier, from<br>
about 1% to about 10% of the medium HLB emulsifier, and from about 1% to about<br>
10% of the high HLB emulsifier. The concentrate is added, with mixing, to the<br>
continuous phase such that the final microemulsion composition comprises from<br>
about 1% to about 15% (preferably from about 2% to about 6%) of the dispersed<br>
phase, and from about 50% to about 99% (preferably from about 70% to about 85%)<br>
of the continuous phase.<br><br>
[0048]	The microemulsions of the present invention may be incorporated into<br>
aqueous-based or lipid-based food and beverage products. These products are<br>
conventional and are well known in the art. Examples and information about the<br>
formulation of such products may be found in the Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and<br>
Nutrition, by Benjamin Caballero, Luis C. Trugo and Paul M. Finglas (editors), 2nd<br>
Edition, London: Academic, 2003, or in the Dictionary of Food Compounds with CD-<br>
ROM: Additives, Flavors and Ingredients, edited by Shmuel Yannai, Boca Raton,<br>
Fla., CRC Press, 2004, or in The Soft Drinks Companion: A Technical Handbook for<br>
the Beverage Industry, by Maurice Shachman, Boca Raton, Fla., CRC Press, 2005, all<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0049]	The microemulsions of the present invention may be incorporated into those<br>
products using the following conventional techniques. The microemulsions can be<br>
incorporated into those products as color, flavor or other types of food ingredients.<br>
The microemulsions can simply be added and mixed or diluted directly into aqueous-<br>
based or lipid-based food and beverage compositions using typical mixers or stirrers.<br>
The speed with which the microemulsion systems are incorporated into food and<br>
beverage products depends on the velocity at which individual components in the<br>
microemulsions dissolve into the specific food and beverage systems; typically the<br>
products can be homogeneous within 5 minutes. The speed of incorporation of<br>
microemulsions into various systems could be accelerated by increasing the speed of<br>
mixing and/or possibly wanning the food systems to about 40°C, if it is necessary.<br>
[0050]	- In addition to the components described above, the food and beverage<br>
compositions, as well as the microemulsions of the present invention, may include<br>
adjunct components conventionally used in food or beverage products at their art-<br>
established levels. Examples of such components include preservatives, antioxidants,<br><br>
flavorants, colorants, nutrients, nutraceuticals, food supplements, antioxidants, plant<br>
extracts, therapeutic agents (for example, chondroitin or electrolytes), and<br>
combinations of those materials. To the extent such components are water-immiscible<br>
or lipid-immiscible, they may be incorporated into the food and beverage<br>
compositions using the microemulsions of the present invention.<br>
[0051]	By using the compositions and methods of the present invention, it is possible<br>
to form effective microemulsions without the use of co-solvents, such as ethanol and<br>
propylene glycol. These co-solvents can result in off-flavors in the food or beverage<br>
compositions. In addition, the microemulsions of the present invention are formed<br>
using lower levels of surfactants than are typically needed in microemulsion<br>
formation. Because of this, the microemulsions of the present invention exhibit less<br>
off-flavor caused by surfactants, are able to carry high levels of difficult-to-disperse<br>
ingredients, and are more stable either in concentrated or dilute form. In addition, the<br>
present invention allows for the preparation of stable compositions containing<br>
difficult-to-disperse ingredients (such as beta-carotene). Beta-carotene is highly<br>
insoluble and tends to recrystallize, hence breaking a typical microemulsion system).<br>
The present invention allows for a stable composition of such materials, such as beta-<br>
carotene, formed in a way which does not require extreme processing conditions.<br>
Further, the microemulsions of the present invention, as well as the food and beverage<br>
products containing them, have a controllable appearance in that by adjusting the<br>
types and concentrations of surfactants and/or the oil phase, the optical properties,<br>
from crystal clear to cloudy, can be adjusted in the finished product<br>
[0052]	The following examples are intended to be illustrative of various embodiments<br>
of the present invention and are not intended to be limiting of the invention definition<br>
in any way.<br><br>
[00531 Example 1 — Beta-carotene oil-in-water microemulsion<br>
The following is an example of the preparation of a beta-carotene oil-in-water<br>
microemulsion of the present invention. The microemulsion has the following<br>
composition:<br><br>
[0054] The above ingredients are prepared in three separate parts: (1) a water phase<br>
(water, sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid); (2) a mixture of emulsifiers containing<br>
the high and medium HLB materials (polysorbate and Triglyceryl monostearate); and<br>
(3) an oil phase which comprises the water-insoluble components and the low HLB<br>
emulsifier (beta-carotene 30%, vitamin E, vitamin A and glycerol monooleate). Heat<br>
is used to melt the beta-carotene and surfactant so that the components form a single<br>
liquid phase. These three parts are then added in the following order to form a<br>
concentrated microemulsion:<br>
[0055] In the first vessel, prepare the aqueous phase by adding sodium benzoate to<br>
deionized water. Mix for 5 minutes with medium agitation until the powder is<br>
completely dissolved. Add ascorbic acid and mix for 5 minutes. In the second vessel,<br>
prepare the emulsifier phase by combining polysorbate 80 (TWEEN®) and<br><br>
polyglycerol ester (tryglyceryl monostearate). Mix well until it is homogeneous. In<br>
the heating kettle, prepare the oil phase by combining beta-carotene 30% oil, glyceryl<br>
monooleate, vitamin A palmitate and alpha tocopherol. After the oil phase is<br>
completely mixed, heat the kettle containing beta-carotene, vitamin E, vitamin A and<br>
glyceryl monooleate to 280-285°F with medium agitation until beta-carotene crystals<br>
are completely dissolved. Immediately add the oil phase from the kettle to the<br>
emulsifier phase in the second vessel, then mix for an additional 5 minutes or until<br>
homogeneous. Then add the aqueous phase (water/sodium benzoate/ascorbic acid)<br>
from the first vessel to the mixture of the oil phase and emulsifier in the second<br>
vessel. Mix at high speed for 15 minutes or until the microemulsion is uniform. The<br>
microemulsion can then be diluted to the desired concentration and added to a food or<br>
beverage product.<br>
