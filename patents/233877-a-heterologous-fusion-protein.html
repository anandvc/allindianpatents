				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to heterologous fusion proteins comprising an active<br>
therapeutic peptide and a constant heavy chain (Fc) portion of an immunoglobulin that<br>
have the effect of extending the in vivo half-life of the active therapeutic peptide. These<br>
heterologous fusion proteins can be used to treat human diseases as well as a variety of<br>
other conditions or disorders.<br>
Many active therapeutic peptides show promise in clinical trials for the treatment<br>
of various diseases. However, the usefulness of therapy involving these peptides has<br>
been limited by the fact that many peptides are poorly active, rapidly cleared in vivo, or<br>
have extremely short in vivo half-lives. Various approaches have been undertaken to<br>
extend the elimination half-life of these peptides or reduce clearance of these peptides<br>
from the body while maintaining biological activity. One approach involves fusing an<br>
active therapeutic peptide to the constant heavy chain (Fc) portion of an immunoglobulin.<br>
Immunoglobulins typically have long circulating half-lives in vivo. For example, IgG<br>
molecules can have a half-life in humans of up to 23 days. The Fc portion of the<br>
immunoglobulin is responsible, in part, for this in vivo stability. These heterologous<br>
fusion proteins take advantage of the stability provided by the Fc portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin while preserving the biological activity of the peptides.<br>
Although this approach is feasible for peptide therapeutics (See WO 02/46227),<br>
there is a general concern regarding half antibody formation, unwanted effector function,<br>
glycosylation sites, and heterogeneity expression. The present invention seeks to<br>
overcome these problems by identifying and substituting amino acids at various positions<br>
in the Fc portion of the molecule that reduce half antibodies and lessen or eliminate<br>
effector function. In addition, the present invention also provides identifying and<br>
substituting amino acids at various positions in the Fc portion of the molecule that do not<br>
have glycosylation sites and have reduced heterogeneity during expression. Furthermore,<br>
it is desired that identifying and substituting amino acids at various positions in the Fc<br>
portion of the molecule does not induce an immune response after repeated and prolonged<br>
administration of the heterologous fusion protein.<br>
Compounds of the present invention include heterologous fusion proteins<br>
comprising an active therapeutic peptide fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:l<br>

The peptide portion and the Fc portion of the present invention are fused directly<br>
together or via a linker. An example of a linker is a G-rich peptide linker having the<br>
sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser (SEQ ID<br>
NO:2). Other examples of linkers include, but are not limited to, Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-<br>
Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser (1.5L) (SEQ<br>

Asp-Lys-Arg (SEQ ID NO:8).<br>
The C-terminus of the peptide portion and the N-terminus of the Fc portion are<br>
fused together. Alternatively, the N-terminus of the peptide portion and the C-terminus<br>
of the Fc portion are fused together. Additionally, the C-terminus of the peptide portion<br>
is fused to the N-terminus of the Fc portion and the N-terminus of another peptide<br>
molecule is fused to the C-terminus of the Fc portion, resulting in a peptide-Fc-peptide<br>
fusion protein.<br>
The present invention also includes polynucleotides encoding the heterologous<br>
fusion proteins of the present invention, as well as vectors and host cells comprising such<br>
polynucleotides. Methods of treating patients suffering from human diseases as well as a<br>
variety of other conditions or disorders comprising administering a heterologous fusion<br>
protein are also encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention comprise an<br>
active therapeutic peptide portion and an Fc portion. The Fc portion comprises<br>
substitutions to the human IgG4 sequence that provide the heterologous fusion<br>
protein with increase in vivo stability compared to the active therapeutic peptide<br>
not fused to an Fc sequence.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention contain an Fc<br>
portion which is derived from human IgG4, but comprises one or more<br>
substitutions compared to the wild-type human sequence. As used herein, the Fc<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin has the meaning commonly given to the term in<br>
the field of immunology. Specifically, this term refers to an antibody fragment<br>
which does not contain the two antigen binding regions (the Fab fragments) from<br>
the antibody. The Fc portion consists of the constant region of an antibody from<br>
both heavy chains, which associate through non-covalent interactions and<br>
disulfide bonds. The Fc portion can include the hinge regions and extend<br>
through the CH2 and CH3 domains to the c-terminus of the antibody. The Fc<br>
portion can further include one or more glycosylation sites.<br>
There are five types of human immunoglobulins with different effector<br>
functions and pharmacokinetic properties. IgG is the most stable of the five<br>
types having a serum half-life in humans of about 23 days. There are four IgG<br>
subclasses (G1, G2, G3, and G4) each of which has different biological functions<br>
known as effector functions. These effector functions are generally mediated<br>
through interaction with the Fc gamma receptor (FcyR) or by binding a<br>
subcomponent of complement 1 (Clq) which recognizes and binds to the heavy<br>
chain of Immunoglobulin G or Immunoglobulin M initiating the classical<br>
complement pathway. Binding to FcyR can lead to antibody dependent cell<br>
mediated cytolysis, whereas binding to complement factors can lead to<br>
complement mediated cell lysis. In designing heterologous fusion proteins<br>
wherein the Fc portion is being utilized solely for its ability to extend half-life, it<br>
is important to minimize any effector function. Thus, the heterologous fusion<br>
proteins of the present invention are derived from the human IgG4 Fc region<br>
because of its reduced ability to bind FcyR and complement factors compared to<br>
other IgG sub-types. IgG4, however, has been shown to deplete target cells in<br>
humans [Issacs et al., (1996) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 106:427-433]. Because the<br>
heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention target cells in various<br>
organs in the body, using an IgG4 derived region in an heterologous fusion<br>
protein could initiate an immune response against the cells through interaction of<br>
the heterologous fusion protein with receptors present on the target cells. Thus,<br>
the IgG4 Fc region which is part of the heterologous fusion proteins of the<br>
present invention contains substitutions that eliminate effector function. The<br>
IgG4 Fc portion of the heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention may<br>
contain one or more of the following substitutions: substitution of proline for<br>
glutamate at residue 233, alanine or valine for phenylalanine at residue 234 and<br>
alanine or glutamate for leucine at residue 235 (EU numbering, Kabat, E.A. et al.<br>
(1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. U.S. Dept. of<br>
Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, NIH Publication no. 91-3242).<br>
These residues corresponds to positions 16, 17 and 18 in SEQ ID NO:l. Further,<br>
removing the N-linked glycosylation site in the IgG4 Fc region by substituting<br>
Ala for Asn at residue 297 (EU numbering) which corresponds to position 80 of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 is another way to ensure that residual effector activity is<br>
eliminated in the context of a heterologous fusion protein.<br>
In addition, the IgG4 Fc portion of the heterologous fusion proteins of the<br>
present invention contain a substitution that stabilizes heavy chain dimer<br>
formation and prevents the formation of half-IgG4 Fc chains. The heterologous<br>
fusion proteins of the present invention preferably exist as dimers joined together<br>
by disulfide bonds and various non-covalent interactions. Wild-type IgG4<br>
contains a Pro-Pro-Cys-Pro-Ser-Cys (SEQ ID NO:3) motif beginning at residue<br>
224 (EU numbering). This motif in a single active therapeutic peptide-Fc chain<br>
forms disulfide bonds with the corresponding motif in another active therapeutic<br>
peptide-Fc chain. However, the presence of serine in the motif causes the<br>
formation of single chain heterologous fusion proteins. The present invention<br>
encompasses heterologous fusion proteins wherein the IgG4 sequence is further<br>
modified such that serine at position at 228 (EU numbering) is substituted with<br>
proline (amino acid residue 11 in SEQ ID NO:l).<br>
The C-terminal lysine residue present in the native molecule may be<br>
deleted in the IgG4 derivative Fc portion of the heterologous fusion proteins<br>
discussed herein (position 230 of SEQ ID NO:l; deleted lysine referred to as des-<br>
K). Heterologous fusion proteins expressed in some cell types (such as NSO<br>
cells) wherein lysine is encoded by the C-terminal codon are heterogeneous in<br>
that a portion of the molecules have lysine as the C-terminal amino acid and a<br>
portion have lysine deleted. The deletion is due to protease action during<br>
expression in some types of mammalian cells. Thus, to avoid this heterogeneity,<br>
it is preferred that heterologous fusion expression constructs lack a C-terminal<br>
codon for lysine.<br>
It is preferred that the C-terminal amino acid of the active therapeutic<br>
peptide portion is fused to the N-terminus of the IgG4 Fc analog portion via a<br>
glycine-rich linker. The in vivo function and stability of the heterologous fusion<br>
proteins of the present invention can be optimized by adding small peptide<br>
linkers to prevent potentially unwanted domain interactions. Further, a glycine-<br>
rich linker provides some structural flexibility such that the active therapeutic<br>
peptide portion can interact productively with its receptor on target cells. These<br>
linkers, however, can significantly increase the risk that the heterologous fusion<br>
protein will be immunogenic in vivo. Thus, it is preferred that the length be no<br>
longer than necessary to prevent unwanted domain interactions and/or optimize<br>
biological activity and/or stability. The preferred glycine-rich linker comprises<br>
the sequence: Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser<br>
(SEQ ID NO:2). Although more copies of this linker may be used in the<br>
heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention, it is preferred that a single<br>
copy of thislinker be used to minimize the risk of immunogenicity associated<br>
with prolonged and repeated administration.<br>

inhibitor, an antigen, an antibody, a hormone, a factor involved in the control of<br>
coagulation, an interferon, a cytokine, a growth factor and/or differentiation factor, a<br>

interactions involved in the pathologies of the circulatory and interstitial compartments<br>
and for example the formation of arterial and venous thrombi, cancerous metastases,<br>

Although the heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention can be made by<br>
a variety of different methods, because of the size of the heterologous fusion protein,<br>
recombinant methods are preferred. For purposes of the present invention, as disclosed<br>
and claimed herein, the following general molecular biology terms and abbreviations are<br>
defined below.<br>
"Base pair" or "bp" as used herein refers to DNA or RNA. The abbreviations<br>
A,C,G, and T correspond to the 5'-monophosphate forms of the deoxyribonucleosides<br>
(deoxy)adenosine, (deoxy)cytidine, (deoxy)guanosine, and thymidine, respectively, when<br>
they occur in DNA molecules. The abbreviations U,C,G, and A correspond to the 5'-<br>
monophosphate forms of the ribonucleosides uridine, cytidine, guanosine, and adenosine,<br>
respectively when they occur in RNA molecules, in double stranded DNA, base pair may<br>
refer to a partnership of A with T or C with G. In a DNA/RNA, heteroduplex base pair<br>
may refer to a partnership of A with U or C with G. (See the definition of<br>
"complementary"', infra.)<br>
"Digestion" or "Restriction" of DNA refers to the catalytic cleavage of the DNA<br>
with a restriction enzyme that acts only at certain sequences in the DNA ("sequence-<br>
specific endonucleases"). The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially<br>
available and their reaction conditions, cofactors, and other requirements were used as<br>
would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Appropriate buffers and substrate<br>
amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer or can be<br>
readily found in the literature.<br>
"Ligation" refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two<br>
double stranded nucleic acid fragments. Unless otherwise provided, ligation may be<br>
accomplished using known buffers and conditions with a DNA ligase, such as T4 DNA<br>
ligase.<br>
"Plasmid" refers to an extrachromosomal (usually) self-replicating genetic<br>
element.<br>
"Recombinant DNA cloning vector" as used herein refers to any autonomously<br>
replicating agent, including, but not limited to, plasmids and phages, comprising a DNA<br>
molecule to which one or more additional DNA segments can or have been added.<br>

DNA cloning vector in which a promoter to control transcription of the inserted DNA has<br>
been incorporated.<br>
"Transcription" refers to the process whereby information contained in a<br>
nucleotide sequence of DNA is transferred to a complementary RNA sequence.<br>
"Transfection" refers to the uptake of an expression vector by a host cell whether<br>
or not any coding sequences are, in fact, expressed. Numerous methods of transfection<br>
are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, calcium phosphate co-<br>
precipitation, liposome transfection, and electroporation. Successful transfection is<br>
generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the<br>
host cell.<br>
"Transformation" refers to the introduction of DNA into an organism so that the<br>
DNA is replicablc. either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal<br>
integration. Methods of transforming bacterial and eukaryotic hosts are well known in<br>

RNA.<br>
"Probe" refers to a nucleic acid compound or a fragment, thereof, which<br>
hybridizes with another nucleic acid compound.<br>
"Leader sequence" refers to a sequence of amino acids which can be<br>
enzymatically or chemically removed to produce the desired polypeptide of interest.<br>
"Secretion signal sequence" refers to a sequence of amino acids generally present<br>

polypeptide with the cell membrane compartments like endoplasmic reticulum and<br>
secretion of that polypeptide through the plasma membrane.<br>
Wild-type human IgG4 proteins can be obtained from a variety of sources. For<br>
example, these proteins can be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from cells which<br>
express the mRNA of interest at a detectable level. Libraries can be screened with probes<br>
designed using the published DNA or protein sequence for the particular protein of<br>
interest. For example, immunoglobulin light or heavy chain constant regions are<br>
described in Adams, et al. (1980) Biochemistry 19:2711-2719; Goughet, et al. (1980)<br>

Screening a cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted<br>
using standard procedures, such as described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY (1989). An alternative<br>
means to isolate a gene encoding an immunoglobulin protein is to use PCR methodology<br>
[Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY (1995)]. PCR primers can be designed based on<br>
published sequences.<br>
Generally the full-length wild-type sequences cloned from a particular library can<br>
serve as a template to create the IgG4 Fc analog fragments of the present invention that<br>
retain the ability to confer a longer plasma half-life on the active therapeutic peptide that<br>
is part of the heterologous fusion protein. The IgG4 Fc analog fragments can be<br>
generated using PCR techniques with primers designed to hybridize to sequences<br>
corresponding to the desired ends of the fragment. PCR primers can also be designed to<br>
create restriction enzyme sites to facilitate cloning into expression vectors.<br>
DNA encoding the active therapeutic peptides of the present invention can be<br>
made by a variety of different methods including cloning methods like those described<br>
above as well as chemically synthesized DNA. Chemical synthesis may be attractive<br>
given the short length of the encoded peptide. The amino acid sequence for the active<br>
therapeutic peptides are generally known and published [Lopez, et al. (1983) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci., USA 80:5485-5489; Bell, etal. (1983) Nature, 302:716-718; Heinrich, G., et<br>
al. (1984) Endocrinol, 115:2176-2181; Ghiglione, M., etal. (1984) Diabetologia 27:599-<br>
600].<br>
The gene encoding a heterologous fusion protein can then be constructed by<br>
ligating DNA encoding an active therapeutic protein in-frame to DNA encoding the IgG<br>
Fc proteins described herein. The DNA encoding an active therapeutic protein and IgG4<br>
Fc fragments can be mutated either before ligation or in the context of a cDNA encoding<br>
an entire heterologous fusion protein. A variety of mutagenesis techniques are well<br>
known in the art. The gene encoding the active therapeutic protein and the gene encoding<br>
the IgG4 Fc analog protein can also be joined in-frame via DNA encoding a G-rich linker<br>
peptide. An example of a DNA sequence encoding one of the heterologous fusion<br>
proteins of the present invention, Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-lL-IgG4 (S228P,<br>

Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described<br>
herein for heterologous fusion protein production and cultured in conventional nutrient media<br>
modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the<br>
genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions, such as media, temperature.<br>
pH and the like, can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In<br>
general, principles, protocols, and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of<br>
cell cultures can be found in Mammalian Cell Biotechnology: A Practical Approach. M.<br>
Butler, ed. (IRL Press, 1991) and Sambrook, et al., supra. Methods of transfection are<br>
known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO4 and electroporation. General<br>
aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,399,216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method<br>
of van Solingen et al., J Bad. 130(2): 946-7 (1977) and Hsiao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 76(8): 3829-33 (1979). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells, such<br>
as by nuclear microinjection, electroporation, bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells, or<br>
polycations, e.g., polybrene or polyomithine, may also be used. For various techniques for<br>
transforming mammalian cells, see Keown, et al., Methods in Enzymology 185: 527-37<br>
(1990) and Mansour, et al., Nature 336(6197): 348-52 (1988).<br>
Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) in the<br>
vectors herein include yeast or higher eukaryote cells.<br>
Eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or<br>
expression hosts for heterologous fusion protein vectors. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a<br>
commonly used lower eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include Schizosaccharomyces<br>
pombe [Beach and Nurse, Nature 290: 140-3 (1981); EP 139,383 published 2 May 1995];<br>
Muyveromyces hosts [U.S. Patent No. 4,943,529; Fleer, et al., Bio/Technology 9(10): 968-75<br>
(1991)] such as, e.g., K lactis (MW98-8C, CBS683, CBS4574) [de Louvencourt et al., J.<br>
Bacterial. 154(2): 737-42 (1983)]; K. fiagilis (ATCC 12,424), K. bulgaricus (ATCC 16,045),<br>
K wickeramii (ATCC 24,178), K waltii (ATCC 56,500), K. drosophilarum (ATCC 36.906)<br>

such as Schwanniomyces occidentulis (EP 394,538 published 31 October 1990); and<br>
filamentous fungi such as, e.g., Neurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium (WO 91/00357<br>
published 10 January 1991), and Aspergillus hosts such as A. nidulans [Ballance et al.,<br>

(1983); Yelton, el al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81(5): 1470-4 (1984)] and A. niger [Kelly<br>
and Hynes. EMBO J. 4(2): 475-9 (1985)]. Methylotropic yeasts are selected from the genera<br>
consisting of Hansenula, Candida, Kloeckera, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Torulopsis, and<br>
Rhodotoruia. A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeast may be found<br>
in C. Antony, The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs 269 (1982).<br>
Suitable host cells for the expression of the heterologous fusion proteins of the<br>
present invention are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells<br>
include insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sp, Spodoptera High5 as well as<br>
plant cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include NSO myeloma cells,<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), SP2, and COS cells. More specific examples include monkey<br>
kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney<br>
line [293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham, et al., J. Gen<br>
Virol., 36(1): 59-74 (1977)]; Chinese hamster ovary cellsADHFR [CHO, Urlaub and Chasin,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77(7): 4216-20 (1980)]; mouse Sertoli cells [TM4, Mather, Biol.<br>
Reprod. 23(l):243-52 (1980)]; human lung cells (W138. ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells<br>
(Hep G2, HB 8065); and mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51). A<br>
preferred cell line for production of the heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention<br>
is the NSO myeloma cell line available from the European Collection of Cell Cultures<br>
(ECACC, catalog #85110503) and described in Galfre, G. and Milstein, C. ((1981) Methods<br>
in Enzymology 73(13):3-46; and Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies: Strategies and<br>
Procedures, Academic Press, N.Y., N.Y.).<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention may be recombinantly<br>
produced directly, or as a protein having a signal sequence or other additional sequences<br>
which create a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature heterologous fusion<br>
protein. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a<br>
part of the heterologous fusion protein-encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. For<br>
yeast secretion the signal sequence may be, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, alpha factor<br>
leader (including Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces cc-factor leaders, the latter described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,010,182), or acid phosphatase leader, the C. albicans glucoamylase<br>
leader (EP 362,179), or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell<br>
expression, mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein, such<br>
as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species as well as viral<br>
secretory leaders.<br>
Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the<br>
vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Expression and cloning vectors will<br>
typically contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes<br>
encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., neomycin,<br>
methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement autotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical<br>
nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for<br>
Bacilli.<br>
An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable<br>
the identification of cells competent to take up the heterologous fusion protein-encoding<br>
nucleic acid, such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild-type<br>
DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated<br>
as described [Urlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77(7): 4216-20 (1980)]. A<br>
suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trpl gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7<br>
[Stinchcomb, et al. Nature 282(5734): 39-43 (1979); Kingsman, et al., Gene 7(2): 141-52<br>
(1979); Tschumper, et al., Gene 10(2): 157-66 (1980)]. The trpl gene provides a selection<br>
marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example,<br>
ATCC No. 44076 or PEPC1 [Jones, Genetics 85: 23-33 (1977)].<br>
Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the<br>
heterologous fusion protein-encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis.<br>
Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Examples of<br>
suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-<br>
phosphoglycerate kinase [Hitzeman, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255(24): 12073-80 (1980)] or other<br>
glycolytic enzymes [Hess et al., J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. 7: 149 (1968); Holland, Biochemistry<br>
17(23): 4900-7 (1978)], such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,<br>
hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase,<br>
3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose<br>
isomerase, and glucokinase. Other yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having<br>
the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter<br>
regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative<br>
enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate<br>
dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable<br>
vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657.<br>
Transcription of heterologous fusion protein-encoding mRNA from vectors in mammalian<br>
host cells may be controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of<br>
viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine<br>
papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and<br>
Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter<br>
or an immunoglobulin promoter, and from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters<br>
are compatible with the host cell systems.<br>
Transcription of a polynucleotide encoding a heterologous fusion protein by higher<br>
eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers<br>
are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that act on a promoter to<br>
increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes<br>
(globin, elastase, albumin, a-ketoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an<br>
enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side<br>
of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the<br>
polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. The<br>
enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to the heterologous fusion<br>
protein coding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5' from the promoter.<br>
Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal,<br>
human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences<br>
necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences<br>
are commonly available from the 5' and occasionally 3' untranslated regions of eukaryotic or<br>
viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as<br>
polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the<br>
heterologous fusion protein.<br>
Various forms of a heterologous fusion protein may be recovered from culture<br>
medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane-bound, it can be released from the membrane<br>
using a suitable detergent solution (e.g., Triton-X 100) or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells<br>
employed in expression of a heterologous fusion protein can be disrupted by various physical<br>
or chemical means, such as freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or cell<br>
lysing agents.<br>
Once the heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention are expressed in the<br>
appropriate host cell, the analogs can be isolated and purified. The following procedures are<br>
exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on carboxymethyl cellulose; gel<br>
filtration such as Sephadex G-75; anion exchange resin such as DEAE or Mono-Q; cation<br>
exchange such as CM or Mono-S; metal chelating columns to bind epitope-tagged forms of<br>
the polypeptide: reversed-phase HPLC; chromatofocusing; silica gel; ethanol precipitation;<br>
and ammonium sulfate precipitation.<br>
Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are<br>
known in the art and described, for example, in Deutscher, Methods in Enzymology 182:<br>
83-9 (1990) and Scopes, Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, Springer-Verlag,<br>
NY (1982). The purification step(s) selected will depend on the nature of the production<br>
process used and the particular heterologous fusion protein produced. For example,<br>
heterologous fusion proteins comprising an Fc fragment can be effectively purified using<br>
a Protein A or Protein G affinity matrix. Low or high pH buffers can be used to elute the<br>
heterologous fusion protein from the affinity matrix. Mild elution conditions will aid in<br>
preventing irreversible denaturation of the heterologous fusion protein.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention may be formulated with one<br>
or more excipients. The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention may be<br>
combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, and the pH adjusted to provide<br>
acceptable stability, and a pH acceptable for administration such as parenteral administration.<br>
Optionally, one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable anti-microbial agents may be added.<br>
Meta-cresol and phenol are preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable microbial agents. One or<br>
more pharmaceutically-acceptable salts may be added to adjust the ionic strength or tonicity.<br>
One or more excipients may be added to further adjust the isotonicity of the formulation.<br>
Glycerin is an example of an isotonicity-adjusting excipient. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
means suitable for administration to a human or other animal and thus, does not contain toxic<br>
elements or undesirable contaminants and does not interfere with the activity of the active<br>
compounds therein.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention may be formulated as a<br>
solution formulation or as a lyophilized powder that can be reconstituted with an appropriate<br>
diluent. A lyophilized dosage form is one in which the heterologous fusion protein is stable,<br>
with or without buffering capacity to maintain the pH of the solution over the intended in-use<br>
shelf-life of the reconstituted product. It is preferable that the solution comprising the<br>
heterologous fusion proteins discussed herein before lyphilization be substantially isotonic to<br>
enable formation of isotonic solutions after reconstitution.<br>
A pharmaceutically-acceptable salt form of the heterologous fusion proteins of the<br>
present invention are within the scope of the invention. Acids commonly employed to form<br>
acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such as P-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenyl-sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic<br>
acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the like. Preferred acid addition salts are those<br>
formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid.<br>
Base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases, such as<br>
ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and the<br>
like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and the<br>
like.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention have biological activity.<br>
Biological activity refers to the ability of the heterologous fusion protein to bind to and<br>
activate a receptor in vivo and elicit a response. A representative number of heterologous<br>
fusion proteins were tested for in vitro as well as in vivo activity. Examples 1 and 2 provide<br>
a representation of in vitro activity based on the ability of the heterologous fusion protein to<br>
interact with and activate the human GLP-1 receptor. In both sets of experiments, HEK293<br>
cells over-expressing the human GLP-1 receptor are used. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor<br>
in these cells causes adenylyl cyclase activation which in turn induces expression of a<br>
reporter gene driven by a cyclic AMP response element (CRE). Example 1 (table 1) provides<br>
representative data wherein the reporter gene is beta lactamase, and example 2 (table 2)<br>
provides representative data wherein the reporter gene is luciferase. Example 3 provides<br>
representative data generated after administration of a heterologous fusion proteins of the<br>
present invention to rats. Example 4 (table 6) provides representative data generated after<br>
administration of a heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention to monkeys.<br>
Example 5 (table 7) provides representative data of the assessment of the potential formation<br>
of antibodies following repeat subcutanesous injections of a heterologous fusion protein.<br>
Example 6 (table 8) provides representative data from a pharmacodynamic study following<br>
an injection of a heterologous fusion protein to monkey. Example 7 (table 9) provides<br>
representative data from a pharmacodynamic study following injections of three different<br>
doses to rats. Example 8 (table 10) provides representative data generated after<br>
administration of a different heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention to mice.<br>
Together the representative data show that the heterologous fusion proteins are able to bind<br>
to and activate their receptor, appear more potent than the active therapeutic peptide, are<br>
active in vivo and have a longer half-life than the active therapeutic peptide, are not<br>
immunogenic, and are dose responsive.<br>
Administration of the heterologous fusion proteins may be via any route known to be<br>
effective by the physician of ordinary skill. Peripheral parenteral is one such method.<br>
Parenteral administration is commonly understood in the medical literature as the injection of<br>
a dosage form into the body by a sterile syringe or some other mechanical device such as an<br>
infusion pump. Peripheral parenteral routes can include intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal routes of administration.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention may also be amenable to<br>
administration by oral, rectal, nasal, or lower respiratory routes, which are non-parenteral<br>
routes. Of these non-parenteral routes, the lower respiratory route and the oral route are<br>
preferred.<br>
The heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention can be used to treat a wide<br>
variety of diseases and conditions.<br>
An effective amount of the heterologous fusion proteins described herein is the<br>
quantity which results in a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect without causing<br>
unacceptable side-effects when administered to a subject in need of the active therapeutic<br>
peptide receptor stimulation. A "desired therapeutic effect" includes one or more of the<br>
following: 1) an amelioration of the symptom(s) associated with the disease or condition;<br>
2) a delay in the onset of symptoms associated with the disease or condition; 3) increased<br>
longevity compared with the absence of the treatment; and 4) greater quality of life<br>
compared with the absence of the treatment.<br>
It is preferable that the heterologous fusion proteins of the present invention be<br>
administered either once every two weeks or once a week. Depending on the disease<br>
being treated, it may be necessary to administer the heterologous fusion protein more<br>
frequently such as two to three time per week.<br>
The present invention will now be described only by way of non-limiting example<br>
with reference to the following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - In vitro GLP-1 receptor activation assay<br>
HEK-293 cells expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, using a CRE-BLAM<br>
system, are seeded at 20,000 to 40,000 cells/well/100 µl DMEM medium with 10%FBS<br>
into a poly-d-lysine coated 96 well black, clear-bottom plate. The day after seeding, the<br>
medium is flicked off and 80 µl plasma-free DMEM medium is added. On the third day<br>
after seeding, 20 µl of plasma-free DMEM medium with 0.5% BSA containing different<br>
concentrations of various GLP-1-Fc heterologous fusion protein is added to each well to<br>
generate a dose response curve. Generally, fourteen dilutions containing from 3<br>
nanomolar to 30 nanomolar or heterologous GLP-1 Fc fusion protein are used to generate<br>
a dose response curve from which EC50 values can be determined. After 5 hours of<br>
incubation with the fusion protein, 20 µl of ß-lactamase substrate (CCF2/AM, PanVera<br>
LLC) is added and incubation continued for 1 hour at which time fluorescence is<br>
determined on a cytofluor. The assay is further described in Zlokarnik, et al. (1998),<br>
Science, 278:84-88. Various GLP-l-Fc fusion proteins are tested and EC50 values are<br>
represented in Table 1. The values are relative to values determined for Val8-GLP-1(7-<br>
37)OH which is run as an internal control with every experiment.<br><br>
Example 2 - In vitro GLP-1 receptor activation assay<br>
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, using a CRE-<br>
Luciferase system, are seeded at 30,000 cells/well/80 µl low serum DMEM F12 medium<br>
into 96 well plates. The day after seeding, 20 µl aliquots of test protein dissolved in 0.5%<br>
BSA are mixed and incubated with the cells for 5 hours. Generally 12 dilutions<br>
containing from 3 pM to 3 nM are prepared at a 5X concentration for each test protein<br>
before addilion to the cells to generate a dose response curve from which EC50 values are<br>
determined. After incubation, 100 µl of Luciferase reagent is added directly to each plate<br>
and mixed gently for 2 minutes. Plates are placed in a Tri-lux luminometer and light<br>
output resulting from luciferase expression is calculated. Various GLP-l-Fc fusion<br>
proteins are tested and EC50 values are represented in Table 2. The values are relative to<br>
values determined for Val8-GLP-l(7-37)OH which is run as an internal control with every<br>
experiment. Because the heterologous fusion proteins tested below are dimers, values are<br>
corrected taking into account a 2-fold difference in molarity.<br><br>
Example 3 Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test in Rats<br>
The heterologous fusion protein, Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-L-IgG4<br>
(S228P,F234A,L235A), is evaluated in an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in<br>
rats. At least four rats are included into each of three groups. Group I receives vehicle<br>
(table 3), Group II receives 1.79 mg/kg of Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-L-IgG4<br>
(S228P,F234A,L235A) as a single subcutaneous injection (table 4), and Group III<br>
receives 0.179 mg/kg of Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-L-lgG4 (S228P,F234A,L235A)<br>
as a single subcutaneous injection (table 5). Rats are subcutaneously injected the morning<br>
of Day 1. Twenty-four hours following the first injection, 1 µL of glucose (D50) per<br>
gram rat body weight is infused as a bolus. Blood samples are taken at 2, 4, 6, 10, 20, and<br>
30 minutes following the bolus infusion of glucose.<br>
Example 4 Pharmacokinetic Study Following a Single Subcutaneous Injection to<br>
Cynomolgus Monkeys.<br>
A study is performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the<br>
heterologous fusion protein, Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-L-IgG4<br>
(S228P,F234A,L235A), when administered as a 0.1 mg/kg by subcutaneous (SC)<br>
injection to male cynomolgus monkeys. R1A antibody is specific for the middle portion<br>
of GLP. ELISA uses an N-terminus specific capture antibody and an Fc specific<br>
detection antibody.<br>
Resulting plasma concentrations from both the ELISA and the RLA are used to determine<br>
the represented pharmacokinetic parameter values.<br>
A representation of the resulting PK parameter values is summarized in table 6.<br>
Single-dose SC PK from the RLA is associated with a mean Cmax of 446.7 ng/mL with a<br>
corresponding Tmax of 17.3 hours. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 79.3<br>
hours (3.3 days). The PK from the ELISA is associated with a mean Cmax of 292.2 ng/mL<br>
with a corresponding Tmax of 16.7 hours. The mean elimination half-life is approximately<br>
51.6 hours (2.2 days).<br>
Example 5 Assessment of the potential formation of antibodies following repeat<br>
subcutanesous injections.<br>
Designated serum samples from cynomolgus monkeys are tested for the formation<br>
of antibodies against Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-l(7-37)-L-IgG4 (S228P,F234A,L235A)<br>
using a direct ELISA format. . Microtiter plates are coated with Gly8-Glu22-Gly36-GLP-<br>
l(7-37)-L-IgG4 (S228P,F234A,L235A) at a 0.1 ng/mL concentration. Monkey serum<br>
samples are diluted 50, 500,1000 and 5000 fold into blocking solution, and 0.05 mL<br>
sample/well are incubated approximately one hour. Secondary antibody, Goat <human></human>
Fab'2&gt;-Peroxidase (with 75% cross reactivity to human), is diluted 10,000 fold into block<br>
and added at 0.05 mL/well and incubated approximately one hour. Color development<br>
using tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is read at an optical density of 450nm -<br>
630nm. Duplicate readings are averaged. A GLP-1 antibody was used as a positive<br>
control and goat<rabbit>(H+L)-Peroxidase conjugate is the secondary used for detection.<br>
Point serum samples are collected prior to dosing, at 24 hours following the second dose,<br>
and 168 hours following the first and second SC dose for an evaluation of potential<br>
immunogenicity. The presence of antibody titers to G8E22-CEX-L-hIgG4 is interpreted<br>
by comparison to predose serum samples and positive control. A representation of the<br>
results is presented in table 7.<br>
Example 6 Pharmacodynamic Study Following a Single Subcutaneously Injection to<br>
Cynomolgus Monkeys in the Fasting State and During a Graded Intravenous Glucose<br>
Infusion.<br>
In Phase 1 (Study Day 1) a subcutaneous injection of vehicle is administered. A<br>
graded intravenous glucose (20% dextrose) infusion of 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/min is then<br>
administered immediately after the vehicle injection. In Phase 2 (Study Day 3), a<br>
subcutaneous injection of a GLP-1 fusion protein (0.1 mg/kg) is administered. In Phase<br>
3,a graded intravenous glucose infusion is performed approximately 96 hours following<br>
the GLP-1 fusion injection.<br>
Graded intravenous glucose infusion procedures are conducted in sedated<br>
monkeys after a 16-hr overnight fast. For both intravenous glucose infusions, baseline<br>
samples will be drawn every 10 min for 20 min to define baseline. A stepped-up glucose<br>
infusion is initiated at +20 min at a rate of 5 mg/kg/min, followed by infusions of 10<br>
mg/kg/min, and 25 mg/kg/min. Each infusion rate is administered for a period of 20<br>
minutes. Blood samples are taken at 10 minute intervals for measurement of glucose,<br>
insulin, and glucagon. Approximately 1.0 mL of blood is collected at -20, -10 min, 0 pre-<br>
glucose infusions, and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes following glucose infusion<br>
for Phases 1 and 3.<br>
A representation of the data are shown in table 8.<br>
Example 7 Pharmacodynamic Study Following Single Subcutaneously Injections of Three<br>
Different Doses to Rats in the Fasting State and During a Graded Intravenous Glucose<br>
Infusion.<br>
Chronically cannulated rats are assigned to either vehicle control (saline) or one of<br>
3 treatment groups (GLP-1 fusion protein; 0.0179 mg/kg, 0.179 mg/kg, or 1.79 mg/kg).<br>
The GLP-1 fusion protein and vehicle are administered via subcutaneous injection.<br>
Twenty-four hours after treatment, overnight fasted (16h) rats are subjected to a graded<br>
intravenous glucose infusion test. The graded glucose infusion test consists of a baseline<br>
saline infusion period (20 min), followed by two 30 min glucose infusion phases at 5 and<br>
15 mg/kg/min, respectively. Plasma samples are collected at -20, -10 min, 0 pre-glucose<br>
infusions (baseline), and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes.<br>
Example 8 Pharmacokinetic analysis of FGF-21 Fusion Protein<br>
FGF-21 fusion proteins are administered by intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous<br>
(SC) routes at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg to CD-I mice. The animals are bled at various times<br>
between 0 and 336 hours after dosing. Plasma is collected from each sample and<br>
analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated using model-<br>
dependent (IV data) and independent (SC data) methods (WinNonlin Pro) and are<br>
reported in table 10 below. By IV administration, the FGF-21-Fc fusion protein has an<br>
elimination half-life of approximately 53.9 hours compared to an elimination half-life of<br>
0.5 hours for native FGF-21. By SC administration the FGF-21-Fc fusion protein has an<br>
elimination half-life of approximately 24 hours compared to an elimination half-life of<br>
0.6 hours for native FGF-21. By both routes of administration the FGF-21-Fc fusion<br>
protein demonstrates prolonged time action when compared to native FGF-21.<br>
