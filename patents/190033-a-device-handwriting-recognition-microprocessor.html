				<td>The present invention relates to a device/handwriting recognition microprocessor, and more particularly to a method of stroke segmentation of handwritten input.<br>
Background of the  Invention<br>
Machine recognition of human handwriting is a very difficult problem, and with the recent explosion of pen-based computing devices, has become an important problem to be addressed.     There exist many very different approaches  to this problem, but one useful approach has been to divide the writing into a sequence of fundamental movements,  or "strokes", and use the strokes  (which are parametrized in some way) as inputs to a stroke-based    character recognizer.<br>
A key requirement in a stroke-based recognizer is that multiple instances of the same character class (e.g. the letter "A" written at different times  and by different writers)  should be divided into a similar set of strokes each time.    This helps insure that recognition is not too difficult, because the description of the character instances will "look" similar to the character recognizer itself.    In the ideal case, all instances of a given character would always contain the same number of strokes, the strokes would all be in the same relative locations, and the featural descriptions of the strokes would all be very similar across the instances.    This ideal is not achievable in practice, but to the extent it can be approached, recognition accuracy can  be improved.<br>
In one technique in the prior art, stroke boundaries are set at points where pen velocity in the vertical (or "y") direction is zero — that is, at points where the writing begins moving upward, or begins moving downward.    The resulting set of strokes may then be called "upstrokes" and "downstrokes".    This method is discussed in    Mermelstein &amp; Eden, "Experiments on Computer Recognition of Connected Handwritten Words", in Information  And  Control vol. 7, pp. 255-270,  1964.    One problem with this method is that it is overly sensitive to changes in the vertical direction, and not sensitive at all to changes in the horizontal direction.    Yet many characters are composed of horizontal pieces — for example, the cross of a "t" and the three prongs of an "E" are normally much more horizontal than vertical, even in sloppy writing.    A y-velocity  based  stroke  segmenter will  sometimes  break a horizontal piece into one stroke, but often it will be broken into two, three, or even many more, simply because of small jitters of the pen in the vertical direction.    This leads to poor recognition accuracy, because multiple instances of the same character will often be  segmented into different-looking  sets of strokes.      Attempts to correct the inaccuracies of this method, including  requiring  a  minimum  vertical  direction  change   before creating a new stroke have had only limited success, and many of the same basic problems still remain.<br>
Accordingly a need exists for a stroke segmentation<br>
technique that is more accurate and not subject to the<br>
problems in the methods discussed, such as the y-velocity<br>
method.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides for a device/handwriting recognition microprocessor for, upon receiving handwritten character input as a sequence of (x,y,pen) points where x and y are coordinates in a two dimensional coordinate system and pen is a binary value indicating an associated penup/pendown state, recognizing a handwritten character composed of a plurality of  (x,y,pen) values, comprising :<br>
an angle change determiner, operably coupled to receive the sequence of<br>
(x,y,pen) points for determining a change in angle at each (x,y,pen) point;<br>
and<br>
a point to  stroke  delineator,  operably coupled  to  the  angle  change<br>
determiner, for determining useful segmentation points and generating a<br>
sequence of straight line strokes to represent the handwritten input from<br>
the useful segmentation points.<br>

Detailed Description  of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Typically,  handwritten  character input is  collected from the user in the form of discrete continuous segments.    A discrete continuous segment consists of one or more pen segments, where a pen segment is the mark left by a pen during its period of contact with an input device such as a digitizing tablet or paper.<br>
In the present invention one or more discrete continuous segments  are  the  units  of handwritten  input being  segmented into strokes.    A stroke is a straight line approximation of the actual handwritten input.  Handwritten input is input which is captured electronically that includes but is not limited to the following:   handwritten  input;  electronic  input;  input captured through pressure,  such as  stamped input;  input that is received electronically, such as via facsimile, pager, or other device.<br>
A segment is represented as a sequence of points sampled at approximately     regular intervals  by the  input device.    Each point is described at minimum by an X coordinate, a Y coordinate, and a pen state.    A pen state indicates whether the pen is in contact with the tablet and can take only one of two values (pen up and pen down).    Segments may be captured electronically using a digitizing tablet, or alternatively may be derived from a scanned or faxed image through a process of line detection in the image;    such methods of capturing electronically are understood in the art.     In a preferred method handwritten input is accepted by a device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or other device.    Other devices that function to receive handwritten input include,  but are not limited to, the following:  computers, modems, pagers, telephones,  digital  televisions,   interactive  televisions,   devices having a digitizing tablet, facsimile devices, scanning devices, and other devices  with the  ability to capture handwritten input.     Generally,  when handwritten  inputs  are  captured electronically, each point is represented by a pixel, such that a segment is represented by a series of pixels on the device.<br>
In   accordance  with  the  present  invention,  handwritten input may be in the form of alphanumeric characters, ideographic  characters  or other forms  of characters  or  symbols of  written   communication.<br>
In  the  present  technique,  stroke  boundaries  are  obtained as points where the angle change is a local maximum and exceeds  a predetermined  threshold  value  that  corresponds  to sharp bends in the writing.    Since a sharp bend can occur regardless of the direction the pen is moving, this method is not sensitive to the orientation of the various parts of handwritten input, such as words or characters.    Referring now to FIG. 1, FIG. 1 illustrates a flowchart of a preferred method in accordance    with the teachings  of the present invention. Handwritten input from the digitizer or other device is received in the form of x, y coordinates and associated penup or pendown states (102).    Typically these points are represented by pixels. Where selected, the x, y inputs are scaled (104)  so the resulting coordinate values  are within prespecified limits. Where selected, the scaled x, y coordinates are smoothed (106)  to remove high-frequency noise  arising from the digitizing tablet.    Smoothing is done by averaging the coordinates (x,y) of a point with its neighbors (weighting the point itself and the nearest points higher),  and replacing the (x,y) coordinate values of the point in question with the computed average.  Preferably,  the  smoothing  window  size is fixed. Smoothing is not done across two separate pendown segments. Upon joining the previous point to the current point, a first vector is formed.    A second vector is formed by joining the current point to the next point.    The angle between the first vector and the second vector,  which represents  the angle change at the current point (see FIG. 6 ), is then determined (108).     Potential  segmentation points  are identified as pendown points at local maxima of the angle changes that exceed a preset threshold (110) (see FIG. 7).    The preset threshold is selected to maximize true  segmentation points  and to minimize false segmentation points  (e.g.,  a segmentation point caused by jitter).     Then,  spurious  segmentation points  are removed (112). For example, 'hooks', i.e., short pen movements at<br>
beginning/end of pen  down  segments,  are removed,  and where an angle change at a first segmentation point is less than the angle change at a second segmentation point that lies within a preset distance from the first segmentation point, the first segmentation point is deleted. Then,    a sequence of straight line strokes   are  determined  from  the  useful  segmentation  points (114).     Straight line segments are also introduced between two segmentation points  that  have  a penup  between  them.<br>
Each straight line stroke is typically described by four parameters: x coordinate of a midpoint of the straight line stroke, y coordinate of the midpoint of the straight line stroke, a length of the straight line stroke, and an angle of the straight line  stroke  with respect to  a predetermined reference.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 2 and FIG. 3, FIG 2 illustrates segmentation points  for handwritten input produced by  a preferred  embodiment  of  the  present  invention   after   step   110 of FIG. 1.    The segmentation points are obtained from a local maximum of the angle change that exceeds a preset threshold and from the beginnings and ends of pen down segments. Thus, in FIG. 2, segments (201, 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216, 218) are determined.    Each of the above segments are  bounded by  two  segmentation  points.<br>
FIG  3  illustrates segmentation  points   (302)   for handwritten  input  produced  by  a preferred  embodiment  of the present invention after step 112 of FIG.  1.    Note that the segmentation point 220 in FIG. 2 is eliminated in FIG. 3 since it represents a spurious  segmentation point.     That is,  segment 201 represents a 'hook', i.e., an artifact, so segmentation point 220 is removed.    The rule for determining that the segmentation point 220 is  spurious  is  that segmentation  220 lies less than a prespecified distance from the segmentation<br>
point; 222, which has a larger angle change when compared with  segmentation  point  220.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a sequence (402) of straight line segments  (strokes)  representing  the handwritten  input  of FIG. 2. The sequence of points between any two consecutive segmentation points shown in FIG. 3 is replaced by a straight line in FIG. 4.<br>
Sometimes a pen is raised from the input device (penup segment) and then is placed at a new position to continue the handwritten input.    An example of this is shown in FIG. 5.    The dotted line  (502) represents the segment where the pen was lifted.    At the end preprocessing, the penup stroke is indistinguishable   from   pendown   strokes.<br>
FIG. 6    is an exploded view illustrating a change in angle determination.    A first vector (602) joins previous raw point k-1 (from original input data) to the current point k.    A second vector (604) joins the current point k to the next point k+1. The angle a between the two vectors is the angle change at point k.    At a beginning point of a pendown segment and also at the end point of a pendown segment, the angle change is set to zero.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates graphically the angle change    values calculated for each point in FIG. 6 plotted against the index k of the original points.    The figure shows three local maxima (702, 704, 706) for the angle changes.    The maxima 702 and 704 exceed the preset threshold 708  and hence are selected as potential  segmentation points.  However,  maximum 706 is  less than the preset threshold 708, and thus is not selected as a segmentation point.     The spatial distance between the points represented by 702  and 704 is less  than  a predetermined distance threshold,  and hence only one of the two points<br>
represented by the maxima is a useful segmentation point and the other is a spurious segmentation point.    Since the maximum 702  is  greater than the maximum 704,  the point represented by maximum 702 is the useful segmentation point, and the point represented by the maximum 704 is a spurious segmentation   point.<br>
Two thresholds must be estimated.     The first threshold 708 is used to compare the angle changes at the local maxima of the angle change curve (FIG. 7) in order to select potential segmentation points.    The second threshold is used to compare the  distance  between  two  segmentation points  to  separate useful and spurious  segmentation points.     When the preprocessing method of the present invention is used with a handwriting character recognizer,  the exact values for the two thresholds are not critical as long as an error-tolerant character recognizer is used.    In performing any experimental tuning of these or any other parameters for creating a specific embodiment of the invention, the desired goal is to attain segmentation which is as consistent as possible across multiple instances of particular character classes.    This should be done empirically  by  examining  how  the  procedure  segments  vary according to actual samples of the writing to be recognized.<br>
The set of segmentation points in accordance with the present invention defines  a set of corresponding  straight line strokes. These straight line strokes can then be forwarded to a stroke-based  character recognizer for recognition  of the handv/ritten    input.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the present invention may also be implemented   by   a   device/handwriting   recognition microprocessor  for,  upon  receiving  handwritten   character  input as a sequence of (x,y, pen) points where x and y are coordinates  in  a two dimensional coordinate system and pen is a binary value  indicating  an  associated penup/pendown  state, recognizing a handwritten character composed of a plurality of (x,y,pen)  values.     The  device/handwriting  recognition microprocessor includes  an angle  change determiner (806),  a potential  segmentation  point  identifier  (808),  an  artifact remover (810), and a stroke determiner (812).     Where selected, said device/microprocessor includes at least one of:  a scaler (802) and   a smoother (804).     The scaler (802) is used for scaling the x,y coordinates so the resulting coordinate values are v/ithin prespecified limits. The  smoother (804) may immediately  precede  the  angle  change  determiner  (806)  or may be operably coupled to the scaler (802) (where a scaler is utilized),    and is used for smoothing the    scaled x, y coordinates to remove high-frequency noise.     The angle change determiner (806) is operably coupled to receive the sequence of (x,y,pen) points and is used for determining a change in angle at each (x,y,pen) point.    Where selected, the angle change determiner (806) may be coupled to receive the- output of one of: the scaler (802)  and the  smoother (804).     The potential  segmentation point identifier (808) is operably coupled to the angle change determiner (806)  and is  used for identifying potential segmentation points  as pendown  points  whose  angle change exceeds a preset threshold.    The artifact remover (810) is operably  coupled to the  potential  segmentation  point identifier (808)  and is  used for removing  spurious  segmentation points  to provide  useful  segmentation points.     The  stroke  determiner (812) is  operably coupled to the  artifact remover (810)  and is used for determining a sequence of straight line strokes to represent  the  handwritten   input  from  the  useful   segmentation points.<br>
In   another   embodiment,   the   device/handwriting recognition microprocessor may include:  A) an angle change determiner (806),  operably coupled to receive the  (x,y,  pen) points,, for determining a change in angle at each (x,y,pen)<br>
point; and B) a point to stroke delineator (816), operably coupled to the  angle  change determiner,  for determining useful segmentation points  and generating a sequence of straight line strokes  to  represent  the  handwritten  input from  the  useful segmentation points.    Where selected, a value adjuster (814) may be operably coupled immediately prior to the angle change determiner (806) to receive the  sequence of (x,y,pen) values, for modifying said values to facilitate processing and for providing the modified values to the angle change determiner   (806).<br>
For example, the value adjuster (814) may be selected to include: A) a scaler (802), for scaling the x,y coordinates so the resulting  coordinate values  are  within prespecified  limits;   and<br>
B)	a smoother (804), operably coupled to the scaler, for<br>
smoothing the    scaled x, y coordinates to remove high-<br>
frequency   noise.<br>
In one implementation, the point to stroke delineator (816) may include:     A) a potential segmentation point identifier (808),,  operably coupled to the angle change determiner (806), for identifying  potential  segmentation  points  as  pendown points whose angle change exceeds a preset threshold; B) an artifact remover  (810),  operably  coupled to  the  potential segmentation  point  identifier  (808),  for removing  spurious segmentation  points  to  provide  useful  segmentation  points;  and<br>
C)	a stroke determiner (812), operably coupled to the artifact<br>
remover (810), for determining a sequence of straight line<br>
strokes  to  represent  the  handwritten  input  from  the  useful<br>
segmentation   points.<br>
Clearly, the method of the present invention	may be<br>
embodied in a tangible medium of/for a computer.	For<br>
example, the tangible medium may be a computer	diskette or a<br>
memory  unit  of the  computer.<br>
The  present  invention  and  its  preferred  embodiments relate to novel, more accurate methods of stroke  segmentation for characters composed of a preponderance of straight line segments  (for example,  Chinese characters).  In accordance with the present invention,  in  multiple  instances  of handwritten input the input is repeatedly divided into a similar set of straight line strokes each time.      Such stroke segmentation aids in  providing  more  accurate  interpretation  by  a  stroke-based character   recognizer.<br>
Those skilled in the art will find many embodiments of the present invention to be useful.    One obvious advantage is that printed and cursive styles of writing look more similar to one another and thus makes the recognition task easier. Another embodiment would be  the  segmentation of scanned,  or "off-line" writing, into strokes.    A straightforward way of applying the present invention to such a task would be to perform thinning of the writing to obtain a constant-width ink curve.  Stroke boundaries could then be set at both angle change maxima points and at intersection points, since the lack of temporal  information  makes  intersections  and  touching bends look similar.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed invention may be modified in numerous  ways  and may  assume  many  embodiments   other  than  the  preferred forms particularly set out and described above.    Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention  and  its   equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
