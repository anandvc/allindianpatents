				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to internal combustion engines. In<br>
particular, the present invention relates to an internal combustion engine with oil<br>
drainback system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Internal combustion engines require oil, or some other form of lubricant,<br>
to lubricate the various moving parts of the engine. In standard internal<br>
combustion engines, this is accomplished by storing the oil in a crankcase and<br>
supplying oil from the crankcase to the various moving parts through some type<br>
of distribution system. The oil from the various parts of the engine is then<br>
returned to the crankcase via some type of drainback system, such as a<br>
drainback passage.<br>
[0003] For example, oil from the crankcase of a standard internal combustion<br>
engine is supplied from the crankcase to the valve train to lubricate the valves,<br>
rocker arms, and other parts of the valve train. The oil from the valve train<br>
passes through the cylinder head of the engine and back to the crankcase<br>
through a drainback passage.<br>
[0004] However, under certain operating conditions, this standard drainback<br>
system poses some drawbacks. For example, under conditions when high<br>
crankcase pressure exists, oil from the crankcase can be forced backwards<br>
through the drainback passage, possibly filling the cylinder head and valve box<br><br>
with oil. Similarly, if the engine were operated at an elevated angle (e.g. tilted<br>
backwards), oil from the crankcase could flow backwards through the drainback<br>
passage, again possibly filling the cylinder head and valve box with oil. If the<br>
cylinder head and valve box were filled with oil, the operation of the air intake,<br>
air exhaust, and spark plug, which are located in the cylinder head, could be<br>
interrupted and oil could possible flow through the valves into the cylinder.<br>
US 5975042 discloses an oil supply apparatus of a four-stroke-cycle engine, in<br>
which an oil supply passage is provided for connecting an oil chamber with a<br>
valve chamber, an oil feed passage for connecting a valve chamber with a crank<br>
chamber, and an oil return passage for connecting the crank chamber with the<br>
oil chamber. The oil return passage is connected with the crank chamber via a<br>
plurality of return vents formed on an inner surface of the crank chamber at<br>
approximately equal intervals. Providing a bypass passage, one end of the<br>
bypass passage opens adjacent to a ceiling of the valve chamber. Another end of<br>
the bypass passage opens into a portion facing the restrictor formed adjacent to<br>
an outlet of the oil feed passage. Accordingly, the crank chamber and the valve<br>
chamber are lubricated by pressure fluctuations of the crank chamber according<br>
to the reciprocation of a piston.<br>
[0005] It would therefore be advantageous if an internal combustion engine<br>
could be designed that prevented oil from the crankcase from filling the cylinder<br>
head and/or valve box of the engine. In particular, it would be advantageous if<br>
the oil drainback system of the internal combustion engine could be designed to<br>
allow the flow of oil through the drainback<br><br>
passage from the vaive box to the crankcase during normal operation and to prevent the flow<br>
of oil through the drawback passage from the crankcase to the valve box during certain<br>
operating conditions, such as when high pressure is present in the crankcase or during<br>
operation at an elevated angle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] One aspect of the present invention is an internal combustion engine<br>
having a crankcase that has walls that define an interior volume for containing oil. A<br>
cylinder head has a proximal end that is fastened to the crankcase and extends laterally<br>
outward from the crankcase and terminates at a distal end. A rocker arm cover is fastened to<br>
the distal end of the cylinder head and defines a cavity that forms a valve box. A drainback<br>
passage interconnects the interior volume of the crankcase and the valve box to enable the<br>
flow of fluid from the valve box to the interior volume of the crankcase. A check valve is<br>
located within the drainback passage and allows the flow of fluid from the valve box to the<br>
interior volume of the crankcase and prevents the flow of fluid from the interior volume of<br>
the crankcase to the valve box.<br>
[0007] This allows oil from the valve box to drain back to the crankcase during<br>
normal operation and prevents oil from traveling backwards through the drainback passage<br>
(into the valve box) when the pressure in the crankcase is increased or the angle of operation<br>
of the engine increases.<br>
[0008] Another aspect of the present invention is an internal combustion engine<br>
where the cylinder head has a bore formed therethrough that extends from the proximal to the<br>
distal end. The crankcase has a cylinder that has a cylinder wall integrally formed in one of<br>
the walls of the crankcase. The cylinder wall has a bore formed therethough that extends<br>
from an interior surface of the cylinder wall, which communicates with the interior volume<br>
of the crankcase, to an exterior surface of the cylinder wall, which engages the proximal end<br>
of the cylinder head. The bore in the cylinder head and the bore is the cylinder wall together<br>
define the drainback passage. In addition, the bore in the cylinder wall is enlarged at one end<br>
to form a cavity in the exterior surface of the cylinder wall and a check ball is disposed<br>
within the cavity. The cavity and the check ball together define the check valve. The check<br>
ball seats against the bore at the proximal end of the cylinder head to prevent the flow of<br><br><br><br>
fluid from the interior volume of the crankcasc to the valve box when there is high pressure,<br>
present within the crankcase or when the engine is operated at an elevated angle.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a single cylinder, 4-stroke, internal combustion<br>
engine 100 designed by Kohler Co. of Kohler, Wisconsin includes a crankcase 110 having a<br><br>
cylinder 160 formed in a sidewall of the crankcase 110, a cover 290 fastened to the top of the<br>
crankcase 110, and a blower bousing 120 mounted on top of the cover 290. Inside of the<br>
blower housing 120 are a fan 130 and a flywheel 140. The engine 100 further includes a<br>
starter 150 mounted to the cover 290 and a cylinder head 170, which has a proximal end<br>
fastened to the crankcase 110 and extends laterally outward from the sidewall of the<br>
crankcase 110 to terminate at a distal end. A rocker arm cover 180 is fastened to the distal<br>
end of the cylinder head 170 and defines a cavity therein which forms a valve box, which<br>
houses the valves and other components of the valve train, which are discussed in more detail<br>
below. Attached to the cylinder head 170 are an air exhaust port 190 shown in Figs. 1 and 2<br>
and an air intake port 200 shown in Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
[0020] As is well known in the art, during operation of the engine 100, a piston<br>
210 (see Fig. 7) moves back and forth within the cylinder 160 towards and away from the<br>
cylinder head 170. The movement of the piston 210 in turn causes rotation of a crankshaft<br>
220 (see Fig. 7), as well as rotation of the fan 130 and the flywheel 140, which are coupled to<br>
the crankshaft 220. The rotation of the fan 130 cools the engine, and the rotation of the<br>
flywheel 140, causes a relatively constant rotational momentum to be maintained.<br>
[0021] Referring specifically to Fig. 2, the engine 100 further includes an air filter<br>
230 coupled to the air intake port 200, which filters the air required by the engine prior to the<br>
providing of the air to the cylinder head 170. The air provided to the' air intake port 200 is<br>
communicated into the cylinder 160 by way of the cylinder head 170, and exits the engine by<br>
flowing from the cylinder 160 through the cylinder head 170 and then out of the air exhaust<br>
port 190. The inflow and outflow of air into and out of the cylinder 160 by way of the<br>
cylinder head 170 is governed by an input valve 240 and an output valve 250, respectively<br>
(see Fig. 8). Also as shown in Fig. 2, the engine 100 includes an oil filter 260 mounted to the<br>
cover 290, opposite the starter 150, through which the oil of the engine 100 is passed and<br>
filtered. Specifically, the oil filter 260 is coupled to the crankcase 110 by way of incoming<br>
and outgoing lines 270, 280, respectively, whereby pressurized oil is provided into the oil<br>
filter 260 and then is returned from the oil filter 260 to the crankcase 110.<br>
[0022] Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the engine 100 is shown with the blower<br>
housing 120 removed to expose the cover 290 of the crankcase 110. With respect to Fig. 3,<br>
in which both the fan 130 and the flywheel 140 are also removed, a coil 300 is shown that is<br><br><br>
mounted to the cover 290 and generates an electric current based upon rotation of the fan 130<br>
and/or the flywheel 140, which together operate as a magneto. Additionally, the cover 290 of<br>
the crankcase 110 is shown to have a pair of lobes 310 that cover a pan' of gears 320 (see<br>
Figs. 5 and 7-8), With respect to Fig. 4, the fan 130 and the flywheel 140 are shown above<br>
the cover 290 of the crankcase 110. Additionally, Fig. 4 shows !he engine 100 without the<br>
cylinder head .170 and without the rocker arm cover 180, to more clearly reveal a pair of<br>
tubes 330 through which extend a pair of respective push rods 340. The push rods 340<br>
extend between a pair of respective rocker arms 350 and a pair of cams 360 (see Fig. 8)<br>
within the crankcase 110, as discussed further below.<br>
[0023] Turning to Figs. 5 and 6, the engine 100 is shown with the cover 290<br>
removed from the crankcase 110 and is shown in cut-away to exclude portions of the engine<br>
that extend beyond the cylinder 160 such as the cylinder head 170. With respect to Fig. 6,<br>
the cover 290 of the crankcase 110 is shown above the crankcase 110 in an exploded view.<br>
The crankcase 110 includes a bottom wall 390 and a series of upright side walls 400 that<br>
define an interior volume 380 for containing oil. The cover 290 and crankcase 110 are<br>
manufactured as two separate pieces such that, in order to access the interior volume 380 of<br>
the crankcase 110, one physically removes the cover 290 from the crankcase 110. Also, as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the pair of gears 320 within the crankcase 110 are supported by and rotate<br>
upon respective shafts 410, which in turn are supported by the bottom wall 390 of the<br>
crankcase 110.<br>
[0024] Referring to Fig. 7, a top view of the engine 100 is provided in which<br>
additional internal components of the engine are shown in grayscale. In particular, Fig. 7<br>
shows the piston 210 within the cylinder 160 to be coupled to the crankshaft 220 by a<br>
connecting rod 420. The crankshaft 220 is in turn coupled to a rotating counterweight 430<br>
and reciprocal weights 440, which balance the forces exerted upon the crankshaft 220 by the<br>
piston 210. The crankshaft 220 further is in contact with each of the gears 320, and thus<br>
communicates rotational motion to the gears. In the present embodiment, the shafts 410<br>
upon which the gears 320 are supported are capable of communicating oil from the bottom<br>
wall 390 of the crankcase 110 (see Fig. 5) upward to the gears 320. The incoming line 270 to<br>
the oil filter 260 is coupled to one of the shafts 410 to receive oil, while the outgoing line 280<br>
from the oil filter is coupled to the crankshaft 220 to provide lubrication thereto. Fig. 7<br><br>
further shows a spark plug 450 located on the cylinder head 170, which provides sparks<br>
during power strokes of the engine to cause combustion to occur within the cylinder 160.<br>
The electrical energy for the spark plug 450 is provided by the coil 300 (see Fig. 3).<br>
[0025] Further referring to Fig. 7, and additionally to Fig. 8, elements of a valve<br>
train 500 of the engine 100 are shown. The valve train 500 includes the gears 320 resting<br>
upon the shafts 410 and also includes the cams 360 underneath the gears, respectively.<br>
Additionally, respective cam follower arms 510 are rotatably mounted to the crankcase 110<br>
and extend to rest upon the respective cams 360. The respective push rods 340 in turn rest<br>
upon the respective cam follower arms 510. As the cams 360 rotate, the push rods 340 are<br>
temporarily forced outward away from the crankcase 110 by the cam follower arms 510.<br>
This causes the rocker amis 350 to rock or rotate, and consequently causes the respective,<br>
valves 240 and 250 to open toward the crankcase 110. As the cams continue to rotate,<br>
however, the push rods 340 are allowed by the cam follower arms 510 to return inward to<br>
their original positions. A pair of springs 520 positioned between the cylinder head 170 and<br>
the rocker arms 350 provide force tending to rock the rocker arms in directions tending to<br>
close the valves 240, 250, respectively. Further as a result of this forcing action of the<br>
springs 520 upon the rocker arms 350, the push rods 340 are forced back to their original<br>
positions.<br>
[0026] Referring to Figs. 9 and 9a, a cross sectional view of the crarkcase 110<br>
and cylinder head 170 of the internal combustion engine 100 is shown. Formed in a lower<br>
wall 172 of the cylinder head 170 is a bore 550, which extends from the valve box at the<br>
distal end of the cylinder head 170 to a sealing surface 185 at the proximal end of the<br>
cylinder head 170. During normal engine operation this bore 550 extends substantially<br>
horizontal, but is tilted downward to enable oil to drain from the valve box by gravity.<br>
[0027] The cylinder 160 has a cylindrical cylinder wall 405 integrally molded<br>
into one of the crankcase walls 400. The cylinder wall 405 defines a cavity within the<br>
cylinder 160 that forms a cylinder cavity 165, which receives the piston (not shown). The<br>
cylinder wall 405 below the cylinder cavity 165 presents an interior surface 460 that<br>
communicates with the interior volume 380 of the crankcase 110 and an exterior surface 465<br>
that engages the sealing surface 185 on the cylinder head 170.<br><br>
[0028] A cylindrical bore 530 is formed in the cylinder wall 405 below the<br>
cylinder cavity 165 and it. extends from the cylinder wall interior surface 460, where it<br>
communicates with the crankcase interior volume 380, to the cylinder wall exterior surface<br>
465, where if. aligns with and couples to the bore 550 in the cylinder head 170. The bore 550<br>
in the cylinder head and the bore 530 in the cylinder wall 405 together define an oil<br>
drainback passage that enables oil collected in the valve box to flow back to the crankcase<br>
interior volume 380.<br>
[0029] The outer end of the bore 530 is enlarged to form a cavity 560 in the<br>
cylinder wall exterior surface 465. A check ball 620 is received in this cavity 560 to form a<br>
check valve, which enables oil to flow out of the valve box through the bore 550 during<br>
normal engine operation, but prevents oil from flowing from the crankcase bore 530 back to<br>
the valve box during certain circumstances, such as times when increased crankcase pressure<br>
is present or operation at an elevated angle, as described in more detail below.<br>
[0030] The check ball 620 is preferably made of a flnorocarbon material, which is<br>
able to withstand high temperature and is highly resistant to oil absorption and wear.<br>
However, the check ball 620 can also be made of any other material that can perform the<br>
sealing required, as described below. Alternatively, the check valve could also be a reed<br>
valve, a check disk, a ball valve, or any other type check valve or similar type one-way flow<br>
sealing device located within the oil drainback passage that would allow the flow of oil from<br>
the valve box to the interior volume 380 of the crankcase 110 during normal operation of the<br>
engine 100 and prevent the flow of oil from the interior volume 380 of the crankcase 110 to<br>
the valve box during certain operating conditions, such as when high pressure is present in<br>
the crankcase or during operation at an angle.<br>
[0031] A head gasket 175 is disposed between the crankcase 110 and the cylinder<br>
head 170 to prevent the leakage of oil from between the cylinder wall exterior surface 465<br>
and the cylinder head sealing surface 185. The head gasket 175 has an aperture 540 that is<br>
aligned with the bores 530, 550 to allow oil to flow through the head gasket 175.<br>
[0032] In alternate embodiments of the invention, the drainback passage does not<br>
have to be integral to the cylinder head and crankcase as described above. The drainback<br>
passage could connect the valve box to the internal volume of the crankcase in any manner,<br><br>
such as externally via a hose, tube, or other method, and have some type of check valve<br>
therein.<br>
[0033] During normal operation of the engine 100 (i.e. at times in the engine<br>
cycle where low crankcase pressure exists and the engine is not being operated at an elevated<br>
angle) the check ball 620 floats within the cavity 560 allowing oil to flow through the cavity<br>
560 and past the check ball 620. This allows oil from the valve box to flow through the bore<br>
550 in the cylinder head 170, through the aperture 540 in the head gasket 175, around the<br>
check ball 620, and through the bore 530 in the side wall 400 back to the crankcase 110.<br>
[0034] At times in the engine cycle where high crankcase pressures exist, the<br>
pressure in the crankcase bore 530 increases and. forces the check ball 620 towards the<br>
cylinder head 170. When this occurs, the check ball 620 passes through the aperture 540 in<br>
the head gasket 175 and seats against the bore 550 at the seating surface 185 of (he cylinder<br>
head 170. Similarly, if the engine 100 is operated at an elevated angle, the check ball 620<br>
moves towards the cylinder head 170. When this occurs, the check ball 620 again passes<br>
through the aperture 540 in the head gasket 175 and seats against the bore 550 at the sealing<br>
surface 185 of the cylinder head 170. The seating of the check ball 620 against the bore 550<br>
closes the oil drainback passage and prevents the oil form flowing backwards through the<br>
bore 550. This allows the engine 100 to operate during times where high crankcase pressures<br>
exist and at elevated angles without the valve box filling with oil.<br>
[0035] In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the check ball 620<br>
prevents the flow of oil backwards through the bore 550 in the cylinder head 170 by seating<br>
against the bore 550 at the distal end of the cylinder head 170. However, the check ball 620<br>
could seat against any surface anywhere along the oil drainback path. For example, if the<br>
aperture 540 in the head gasket 175 were made smaller the check ball 620 would seat against<br>
the head gasket 175 rather than passing through, thereby preventing oil from flowing<br>
backwards through the bore 550 back into the valve box,<br>
[0036] In the present embodiment, the engine 100 is a vertical shaft engine<br>
capable of outputting 15-20 horsepower for implementation in a variety of consumer lawn<br>
and garden machinery such as lawn mowers. In alternate embodiments, the engine 100 can<br>
also be implemented as a horizontal shaft engine, be designed to output greater or lesser<br>
amounts of power, and/or be implemented in a variety of other types of machines, e.g., snow-<br><br>
blowers. Further, in alternate embodiments, the particular arrangement of parts within the<br>
engine i(50 can vary from those shown and discussed above. For example, in one alternate<br>
embodiment, the cams 360 could be located above the gears 320 rather than underneath the<br>
gears.<br>
[0037] While the foregoing specification illustrates and describes the preferred<br>
embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the<br>
precise construction herein disclosed. The invention can be embodied in other specific forms<br>
without departing from the spirit or essential attributes of the invention. Accordingly,<br>
reference should be made to the following claims, rather than to the foregoing specification,<br>
as indicating the scope of the invention.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An internal combustion engine (100), with oil drainback system,<br>
comprising:<br>
a crankcase (110) having walls which define an interior volume for<br>

valve box;<br>
a drainback passage (550,530) interconnecting the interior volume (380) of<br>
the crankcase (110) and the valve box to enable the flow of fluid from the<br>
valve box to the interior volume (380) of the crankcase (110); and<br>
a check valve (620), disposed within the drainback passage (550), for<br>
allowing the flow of fluid from the valve box to the interior volume (380) of<br>
the crankcase (110) and preventing the flow of fluid from the interior volume<br>
(380) of the crankcase (110) to the valve box, wherein the check valve<br>
comprises a check ball (620) seating against a bore (550) defining at least a<br>
portion of the drainback passage (550,530) at the proximal end of the<br>
cylinder head (170) to prevent the flow of fluid from the interior volume (380)<br>
of the crankcase (110) to the valve box when there is high pressure present<br>
within the crankcase (110) or when the engine (100) is operated at an<br>
elevated angle;<br><br>
wherein the cylinder head (170) has a first bore (550) formed therethrough<br>
extending from the distal end to the proximal end of the cylinder head (170);<br>
the cylinder (160) has a cylinder wall (405), integrally formed in the one wall<br>
(400) of the crankcase (110) and having an interior surface (460) that<br>
communicates with the interior volume (380) of the crankcase (110) and an<br>
exterior surface (465) that engages the proximal end of the cylinder head<br>
(170); and<br>
the cylinder wall (405) has a second bore (530) formed therethrough<br>
extending from the interior surface (460) to the exterior surface (465), where<br>
it aligns with and couples to the cylinder head bore, wherein the first bore<br>
(550) and the second bore (530) together define the drainback passage, and<br>
said check ball (620) is disposed in a cavity (560) formed at one end of said<br>
second bore (530) and seats against said second bore (530) to prevent the<br>
flow of fluid from the interior volume (380) of the crankcase (110) to the<br>
valve box when there is high pressure present within the crankcase (110) or<br>
when the engine (100) is operated at an elevated angle.<br>
2.	The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the<br>
drainback passage (550,530) is formed as an integral part of the cylinder<br>
head (170) and the crankcase (110).<br>
3.	The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the check<br>
ball (620) is formed of a fluorocarbon material.<br><br>
4. The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the check<br>
valve (620) is configured so that when the crankcase (110) is tipped beyond a<br>
predetermined angle, the check valve (620) substantially prevents the flow of<br>
fluid from the interior volume (380) of the crankcase (110) to the valve box<br>
regardless of a position of the piston (210).<br>
5.	The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the check<br>
valve (620) allows and prevents the flow of fluid in the drainback passage<br>
(550,530) in response to pressure in the crankcase (110).<br>
6.	The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the check<br>
valve (620) comprises a reed valve.<br>
7.	The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein the check<br>
valve (620) comprises a check disk.<br>
8.	The internal combustion engine, as recited in claim 1, wherein the check<br>
valve (620) comprises a ball valve.<br>
9.	The internal combustion engine, as claimed in claim 1, comprising a head<br>
gasket (175) disposed between the crankcase (110) and the cylinder head<br>
(170), the head gasket (125) having an aperture (540) that is aligned with<br>
the first and second bores (550,530) to allow the flow of fluid therethrough<br><br>
An internal combustion engine (100) having an oil drainback passage (530,550)<br>
and integral check valve (620). The oil drainback passage (530,550) allows the<br>
flow of oil from the valve box to the crankcase (110) of the engine (100) during<br>
normal operation and prevents the backwards flow of oil from the crankcase<br>
(110) to the valve box when high pressures exist in the crankcase (110) or if the<br>
engine (100) is operated at elevated angles. The oil drainback passage (530) is<br>
formed by a bore (530) through a cylinder wall (405) of the crankcase (110) and<br>
a bore (550) through the cylinder head (170). The check valve (620) includes a<br>
cavity within the cylinder wall (405) of the crankcase (110), located at the end of<br>
the bore in the cylinder wall (405) where it meets the bore in the cylinder head<br>
(170), and a check ball (620) disposed within the cavity. During normal<br>
operation, the check ball (620) floats within the cavity and allows the flow of oil<br>
through the oil drainback passage (530) back to the crankcase (110). If high<br>
crankcase pressures exist, or if the engine (110) is operated at an elevated<br>
angle, the check ball (620) will seat against the end of the bore (550) in the<br>
cylinder head (170) and prevent the backward flow of oil through the drainback<br>
passage (530) to the valve box.</td>
