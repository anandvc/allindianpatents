				<td>METHODS FOR THE PREPARATION OF BENZOXAZOLE SULFONAMIDE COMPOUNDS AND INTERMEDIATES THEREOF<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for the preparation of benzoxazole sulfonamide compounds as well as novel intermediates for use in said method. More in particular the invention relates to methods for the preparation of 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamide compounds which make use of 2-mercapto-benzoxazole sulfonamide intermediates, more in particular methods employing the intermediate l-Ben7yl-2-hydroxy-3-[isobutyl-(2-methylsulfanyl-benzoxazole-6-sulfonyl)-amino]-propyl)-carbamic ester, and to methods amenable to industrial scaling up. Said benzoxazole sulfonamide compounds are particularly useful as HTV protease inhibitors.<br>
Background<br>
The virus causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is known by different names, including T-lymphocyte virus III (HTLV-ITI) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) or AIDS-related virus (ARV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Up until now, two distinct families have been identified, i.e. HTV-1 and HIV-2. Hereinafter, HIV will be used to generically denote these viruses.<br>
One of the critical pathways in a retroviral life cycle is the processing of polyprotein precursors by retroviral protease. For instance, during the replication cycle of the HIV virus, gag and gag-pol gene transcription products are translated as proteins, which are subsequently processed by a virally encoded protease to yield viral enzymes and structural proteins of the virus core. Most commonly, the gag precursor proteins are<br>
processed into the core proteins and the pol precursor proteins are processed into the<br>
' ') viral enzymes, e.g., reverse transcriptase and retroviral protease. Correct processing of<br>
the precursor proteins by the retroviral protease is necessary for the assembly of infectious virions, thus making the retroviral protease an attractive target for antiviral therapy. In particular for HIV treatment, the HTV protease is an attractive target.<br>
Several protease inhibitors are on the market or are being developed. Benzoxazole sulfonamide HTV protease inhibitors, for example 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides,<br>
' ~A<br>
have been described to have favourable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic<br>
properties against wild-type and mutant HIV virus. The particular core structure, 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamide, can generally be prepared using procedures analogous to those procedures described in WO 95/06030, WO 96/22287, WO 96/28418, WO 96/28463, WO 96/28464, WO 96/28465 and WO 97/18205. In<br><br>
particular, methods for preparing 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides have been described in WO 02/092595. However, such methods are in general complex, experiencing a burdensome halosulfonation, and providing insufficient yields for commercial purposes. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved methods for preparing 2-amino benzoxazole sulfonamide protease inhibitors, which overcome at least some of the above-mentioned problems.<br>
The present invention provides unproved methods for preparing a retrovirus protease inhibitor, in particular for preparing 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides. In particular, the present invention provides novel intermediate compounds of formula (6), 2-mercapto-benzoxazole sulfonamides, which are useful as precursors in the synthesis of 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The use of compounds of formula (6) as intermediates allow the production of a broad and diverse range of 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamides, thus providing a broad range of HIV protease inhibitors starting from a single family of intermediates. Also, as exemplified below, the present method presents a convenient sulfonation and is consequently easy and cost-effective. Furthermore, another advantage of the present method is that acceptable yields for commercial purposes of 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamide protease inhibitors can be obtained. The present method has the further advantage of using commercially available starting material, such as a 2-mercapto-benzoxazole. The reagents further used in said method are safe and available in bulk. Furthermore, each step of said method provides with the desired compound in good yield. Moreover, each step of said method can be performed stereoselectively, which allows the synthesis of pure stereoisomeric forms of said compounds when using, where appropriate, optically pure starting material and reagents. Thus, the methods according to the present invention are amenable for industrial scaling up.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying examples.<br><br>

Compound of formula (1)<br>
Compound of formula (1), 2-mercapto-benzoxazole, may be directly purchased from commercially available sources, or may be prepared with procedures available in the<br>
art. Compounds of formula (2)<br>
The 2-mercaptobenzoxazole, compound of formula (1), is subjected to a reaction with a suitable reagent to introduce an electrophilic moiety (E) which together with the -S-atom form a thiol-based leaving group (-S-E).<br>
Said reagent is any material capable of providing to the reaction an electrophilic moiety (E) capable of reacting with the sulfur atom of the thiol (or mercapto or sulfhydryl) of the compound of formula (1) to form a new carbon sulfur bond thereby creating a thioether linkage, thus resulting in a thiol-based leaving group (-S-E).<br>
The term "leaving group" is an atom or group of atoms which is displaceable upon reaction with an appropriate nucleophile. Such leaving groups are well known in the art. The term "electrophilic moiety" is so used to describe the electron deficient center moiety of an electrophile.<br>
Preferred electrophiles for introducing electrophilic moieties are the alkylating agents which include, but are not limited to, Ci^alkyl halides such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, n-propyl iodide, butyl iodide, methyl bromide, ethyl bromide, n-propyl bromide, and pentyl bromide; cyc]oC3.7aIkyl halides such as cyclohexyl bromide, and cyclopentylmethyl bromide; aryl-CMalkyl halides such as 2-bromobenzyl bromide, 2-bromobenzyl chloride and the like; di-C1-6alkyl sulfates such as dimethyl sulfate, diethyl sulfate, and di-n-propyl sulfate;<br>

A particular suitable C1-6alkylating agent is methyliodide, which can be dissolved in customary solvents. Alternatively, ethyltosylate may be.used as C1-6alkylating agent.<br>
In still other embodiments, the electrophile may be a group wherein, upon reaction with the nucleophilic S, an addition reaction takes place, leading to the formation of a covalent bond, for example with electron-deficient alkenes, such as a,p-unsaturated carbonyls, vinylsulfoness.<br>
The introduction of an electrophilic moiety (E) is carried out in the presence of conventional non-nucleophilic inorganic or organic bases. These include, for example, the hydrides, hydroxides, amides, alcoholates, acetates, carbonates, or hydrogen carbonates of alkaline earth metals or alkali metal hydrides such as, for example,<br><br>
sodium hydride, potassium hydride or calcium hydride, and metal amides, such as sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diisopropylamide or potassium hexamethyl-disilazide, and metal alkanes such as sodium methylate, sodium ethylate, potassium tert-butylate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, calcium acetate, ammonium acetate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, cesium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, or ammonium carbonate, and also basic organic nitrogen compounds such as, trialkylamines, like trimethyl-amine, triethylamine, tributylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N- dimethyl-benzylamine, N.N-diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane (DABCO), l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene (DBN), or 1,8- diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU), or an excess of an appropriate piperidine compound may be used. The base is preferably potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, a sodium C^alkoxide (e.g. sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, etc.), 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine, sodium hydride, triethylamine and the like.<br>
Suitable solvents for use in the introduction of an electrophilic moiety (E) include any one which does not disturb the reaction, such as aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic, optionally halogenated. hydrocarbons such as, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, dichloro-methane, chloroform, tefrachloromethane; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or ethylene glycol diethyl ether; ketones such as acetone, butanone, or methyl isobutyl ketone; nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile or benzonitrile; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N- dimethylacetamide, N-methylformanilide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone, l,3-dimpthyl-2-imidazo]idinone, or hexamethylphosphoric triamide; esters such as methyl acetate..or ethyl acetate; sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n- or i-propanol, n-, i-, s-, or t-butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; or mixtures of these solvents. Preferably the alkylation reaction is carried out in suitable aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran,.2-.methyltetrahydrofuran, methyl t-butyl ether, diethyl ether, dioxane; or esters such <as ethyl acetate or mixtures thereof.></as>
In an embodiment,,the introduction of an eletrophilic moiety is exemplified with an Cj^alkylation reaction, which is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from about -30°C to about 180°C, preferably at a temperature of from about 10°C to about<br><br>
70°C, more preferably at a temperature of from about 10°C to about 55° C, even more preferably at a temperature of from about 15° C to about 40° C, being room temperature most preferred.<br>
The ratios of equivalents between the 2-mercaptobenzoxazole and the Cualkylating agent may range from 1:1 to 1:5, respectively. Preferably, the ratio of equivalents between the 2-mercaptobenzoxazole and the Ci ^alkylating agent is from 1:1 to 1:2, more preferably the ratio is around 1:1.1. The ratios of equivalents between the 2-mercaptobenzoxazole and the base may range from 1:1 to 1:5, preferably the ratio of equivalents ranges from 1:1.1 to 1:2, more preferably the ratio is around 1.3.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the alkylation reaction is carried out in the presence of about 1.1 equivalents of methyl iodide, 1.3 equivalents of potassium carbonate and ethyl acetate, at ambient temperature, and stirring around 24 hours.<br>
Alternative alkylating reactions encompass the use of Grignard reagents. Alkylating reactions are further described in Organic Synthesis, Vol. 31, pages 90-93, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, New York.<br>
Compounds of formula (3)<br>
Sulfonyl derivatives of formula (3) are prepared as illustrated in following scheme.<br>
Sulfonation of an intermediate of formula (2) may be performed by any conventionally known method. As used herein, the term "sulfonation" means methods of introducing a sulfonyl moiety -S02- into a molecule.<br>

electrophilic aromatic substitutions, which can be used singly or in combinations of two or more types.<br>
The sulfonation is simultaneously or subsequently followed with the insertion of a leaving group (LG), to form the moiety LG-SCh-. Alternatively, the sulfonation agent has the leaving group already incorporated. Agents for the insertion of a leaving group are halogenating reagents such as, phosphorous chloride, phosphoric chloride, thionly chloride, phosphorus bromide, acetyl chloride, methyl chloroformate, methanesulfonyloxy chloride or an oxide.<br>

Thus, the present invention also relates to HTV protease inhibitors of formula (9) or any pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, obtained by using a compound of formula (6) as intermediate, wherein both compound of formula (6) and HIV protease inhibitors of formula (9) are prepared as described in the present invention.<br>
The following examples are meant to illustrate the present invention. These examples are presented to exemplify the invention and are not to be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 illustrates the preparation of abenzoxazole sulfonamide compound according to the invention corresponding to formula (6) by reacting a sulfonylchloride with an intermediate corresponding to formula (5). Example 2 and 3 illustrate the preparation of 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamide protease inhibitors using a benzoxazole sulfonamide compound according to the invention.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of a benzoxazole sulfonamide compound<br>
A benzoxazole sulfonamide represented by compound c-6 in the below provided<br>
Scheme C, can be prepared as follows.<br>
The intermediate c-2 was prepared by adding 2-mercaptobenzoxazole (c-1 which is equal to compound of formula (1) above) (1200 g; 7.94 mol) to 8500 ml ethylacetate in a 20 L flask. Then 1420 g (10.29 mol) potassium carbonate was added at rt. iodomethane (1243 g; 8.76 mol) was added dropwise to this reaction mixture maintaining the internal temperature below 40°C. This mixture was stirred for 24 hours while the internal temperature decreased to 20°C. The reaction mixture was then treated with 4000 ml water and 138 g NfyOH at rt for about 20 minutes. The organic layer was separated and filtered. The aqueous phase was extracted with 1200 ml ethylacetate. The organic layers were collected and washed with 1500 ml water. The organic phase was evaporated under reduced pressure until a final volume of about 2000m]. Magnesium sulphate was added and the mixture was filtered. The filtrate was<br><br>
evaporated under reduced pressure yielding 1288 g of the intermediate c-2 (98 % yield /HPLC purity 99.6%).<br>
In order to prepare intermediate c-3, chlorosulfonic acid (3890 g; 33.3 mol) was stirred under nitrogen. Then intermediate c-2 (1288 g; 7.80 mol) was added portionwise maintaining the internal temperature below 60°C by external cooling. After complete addition of intermediate b-2 the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 85°C. The heating was removed and the reaction mixture was cooled down until 65°C. SOCk was added dropwise while maintaining a controlled release of gases by good stirring. This mixture was stirred overnight at 65°C. This reaction mixture was added to a well stirred mixture of EtOAc (6.9 kg) and ice (9.2kg) while maintained the temperature below 0°C. The organic layer was isolated. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (3.1 kg). The combined organic layer was washed with 7.5 % NaHCOs (210 g/2.8 L water). Because the pH of this water layer was still 1, therefore another 125 g NaHCOj was added. This mixture was stirred for 1 hour, then the phases were separated. The organic layer was dried with NazCOs (2.5 kg). After filtration 1935 g of intermediate c-3 was obtained (yield 94%, HPLC purity 94%) and used in the preparation of compound c-6.<br>
Intermediate c-5 was prepared by reacting in a 20 L flask 1595 g of intermediate c-4 under inert conditions with 2400 g isopropanol. Then 6198 g isobutylamine was added at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated and stirred overnight at an internal temperature of 65 °C. The excess of isobutylamine was removed as far as possible by distillation at 85°C. Then 3 L hexane was added and the solvents were removed by an azeotropic distillation at 90 °C. The azeotropic distillation with hexane was repeated 3 times. The remaining product in the 20 L flask was crystallised during cooling overnight upon rt. The solid white crude was solved by adding 3 L EtOAc and healed to 65°C. After complete dissolution of the white crude, 1.5 L EtOAc was distilled. The remained solution comprising intermediate c-5 was stirred at an internal temperature of 65°C and was used in situ for the synthesis of compound c-6.<br>
For preparing compound c-6 the solution of intermediate c-5 was stirred at &gt;65°C and triethylamine (1400 gj was added. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to 50°C and the EtOAc solution of intermediate c-3 was added in 3 hours while maintaining the reaction-temperature at 40°C - 50°C by cooling with water. TLC showed no starting material after 30 min. but the reaction was stirred overnight while the internal temperature decreased to 20°. The mixture was heated to 45°C and washed with 5 L water, with 4.2 L water .plus 800 g 30% HC1 and with 4.5 L water plus 250 g NaHCO3. The organic layer was,separated and crystallised by stirring overnight while the<br><br>
temperature decreased to 20°C. After further cooling to 0°C - 5°C, the solid was filtered and dried in the vacuumoven at 40°C, yielding 2585 g of compound c-1 (76 % yield, HPLC purity 98.2%).<br><br>

Example 2: Preparation of a 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamide (compound d-5) This example illustrates the preparation of a 2-amino benzoxazole sulfonamide protease inhibitor, represented as d-5 in the below provided Scheme D.<br>
For preparing this protease inhibitor intermediate d-1 was charged into a 10 L sealed reactor and heated until 105°C. The pressure rose up to 2.2 bar. Then NHs-gas (319 gram; 18.7 mol NHa-gas) was added until a pressure of 7.5 - 8 bar was achieved. This reaction mixture was stirred for 15 hours at an internal temperature of 105°C -110°C. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to an internal temperature of 35°C and the pressure was released carefully. The reaction mixture was collected in a 10 L drum. This procedure was repeated 3 times to end up with 3 different batches (batch 1,2 and 3). The purity on HPLC was about 75% for the 3 different batches. The 3 different batches were collected, pooled and evaporated on a Buchi apparatus to end up with a final volume of about 6 L iso-propanol. This residue was stirred and heated at 75 °C. Water (4.5 L) was added and the slurry was stirred for 30 min at 75 °C. Then the<br><br>
heating was removed and the mixture was stirred overnight at rt. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with 400 ml iso-propanol. The product was dried for two days in the vacuum oven at 50 °C to yield 1514 gram (80% yield; HPLC purity 97.04%) of intermediate d-2.<br>
Subsequently, 1514 gram of intermediate d-2, was stirred in 32 L ethylacetate and heated until 60°C. 2100 ml HCl/isopropanol 5N was added slowly and a white precipitate was formed and COa gas was released. After adding all of the HCl/isopropanol 5 N the reaction mixture is stirred for 3 - 4 hours at an internal temperature of 55 °C - 60 °C. Then the precipitate was filtered and washed with ethylacetate 400 ml. The wet precipitate was evaporated on a Biichi apparatus and then dried overnight in the vacuum oven at 50°C to yield 1265 gram 1 (83% yield; HPLC purity 98.58 %) of intermediate d-3.<br>
Then, intermediate d-3 was further reacted with intermediate d-4, in the presence of triethylamine and dichloromethane in order to obtain d-5, which was further purified by ethanol extraction to yield d-5 (&gt;85 % yield / HPLC purity 97 %).<br>

Example 3: Preparation of a 2-amino-benzoxazole sulfonamide (compound e-5) This example illustrates the preparation of a 2-amino benzoxazole sulfonamide protease inhibitor, represented as e-5 in the below provided Scheme E.<br>
A suspension of intermediate e-1 (1000 g; 1.77 mol) in 6000 ml isopropanol was heated until complete dissolution (Ti 75°C). Over a period of 5 min. methylamine (4800 g, 40%wt in HaO; 62 mol) was added (Ti after addition 65 °C). The resulting solution was stirred and heated (Ti 65°C) for 1 hour. The 20 L reactor flask was opened and heated while stirring rapidly until most of excess methylamine was removed (Ti &gt;70°C). At 70°C, 7500 ml hot water was added while maintaining the internal temperature &gt; 70°C. Then the heating was removed and the reaction mixture was cooled to 30°C overnight. At Ti 66°C a bulky precipitate of intermediate e-2 was formed. At 30°C the precipitate was filtered. The precipitate was washed with 2000 ml isopropanol/water (1/1) and dried, yielding about 1000 g of intermediate e-2 (90 -100% yield; HPLC purity; 96.9%).<br>
Subsequently, a suspension of 16.6kg wet intermediate e-2 was charged into a 150 L reactor. Then 150 kg EtOAc was added and the suspension was stirred while heating to 78°C. The water in the reaction mixture was removed by an azeotropic distillation. The distillation was stopped when KF of the reaction mixture showed less then 0.15w/w% water. The reactor contained about 4800 g of intermediate e-2 TIC 1662 after the azeotropic distillation (± 95% yield). The remained clear solution (± 4800g intermediate e-2 in SOL EtOAc) was stirred at 65°C and 6.7 L HCl/iso-propanol (5 to 6 N solution in isopropanol) was added over 0.5 hour. The resulting mixture was further stirred at an internal temperature of 65°C. Another 1 L HCl/iso-propanol (5 to 6 N solution in isopropanol) was added at 65°C. This reaction mixture was further stirred overnight while the heating was removed. The reaction mixture was cooled to 15°C then filtered and washed with 5.2 kg EtOAc, yielding 8.5 kg intermediate e-3 wet,<br>
which was dried at rt under a nitrogen flow, providing 3.376 kg intermediate e-3 (74%<br>
••-&gt;,~ i<br>
yield; HPLC purity;;9,8.1%).<br>
Then, intermediate e-3 was further reacted with intermediate e-4, in the presence of triethylamine and EtOAc in order to obtain e-5 (yield 75%, purity 98.8%).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
