				<td>Resin compositions for wrinkle-pattern paint purposes.<br>
Specification [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The invention concerns resin compositions which are used in paints with which paint films which have a wrinkle pattern can be formed. [Technical Background] [0002]<br>
Paints which contain (A) from 60 to 95 parts by weight of polyester resin which has hydroxyl groups, (B) from 5 to 40 parts by weight of methylated melamine resin and (C) from 0.2 to 3 parts by weight of sulfonic acid blocked with tertiary amine of boiling point from 80 to 150°C and which contain pigment, as required, are known as paints with which paint films which have a wrinkle pattern can be obtained (see Patent Citation 1). However, in this case there is a problem in that a stable wrinkle pattern cannot be obtained in the paint films. [0003]<br>
Furthermore, paints which are characterized by containing per 100 parts by weight in total of (A) from 60 to 95 parts by weight of hydroxyl group containing paint film forming base resin and (B) from 5 to 40 parts by weight of low skeleton-methylated melamine<br>
resin, (C) from 0.1 to 3 parts by weight as the amount of sulfonic acid of a reaction mixture of one equivalent of sulfonic acid and from 1.5 to 3 0 equivalents of a secondary or tertiary amine of boiling point from 30 to 250°C and (D) from 0.2 to 10 parts by weight of organopolysiloxane which has at least two (blocked) isocyanate groups per molecule at the ends of the molecule are known as paints with which paint films which have a fine wrinkle pattern finish can be obtained (see Patent Citation 2). However, in this case the wrinkle pattern finish lacks aging stability and furthermore the paint is also unsatisfactory in that a stable wrinkle pattern finish cannot be obtained in respect of even slight changes in the painting conditions and, moreover, there is a problem in that the staining resistance is unsatisfactory when the paint is used outdoors. [0004]<br>
Furthermore, a paint which is characterized in that it contains per 100 parts by weight in total of (A) from 65 to 95 parts by weight of polyester resin of hydroxyl group value from 5 to 110 and (B) from 5 to 3 5 parts by weight of low nuclear methylated melamine resin, (C) from 0.1 to 3 parts by weight as sulphonic acid of a reaction mixture of 1 mol of sulfonic acid and at least 7.2 mol of secondary amine, (D) from 1 to 15 parts by weight of silica powder of average particle<br>
diameter not more than 10 µm and (E) from 1 to 3 0 parts by weight of one or more selected from among organic resin particles and inorganic glass particles of average particle diameter from 2 to 70 µm and organic resin fibers and inorganic fibers of average diameter from 2 to 50 µm is known as a paint which has good corrosion resistance and with which a wrinkle pattern finish which has excellent design features and pattern stability can be formed. However, in this case the mol ratio of secondary amine is an excess with respect to the sulfonic acid and so there is a weakness in that when combined with the organosilicate based agent for providing a hydrophilic nature the hydrophilic performance declines in a short period of time.<br>
[0005]<br>
Furthermore, a thermosetting resin composition which contains (A) a film-forming polyol resin which has a hydroxyl value of from 5 to 3 00 mgKOH/g and a number average molecular weight of from 500 to 20,000,<br>
(B) a hardening agent which can react with the abovementioned film-forming polyol resin, (C) an organosilica sol of particle diameter from 10 to 100 nm and a hydrophobicity represented by the hexane tolerance value of at least 15.0 ml and (D) at least one partially hydrolyzed condensate of an alkoxysilane compound is known as a thermosetting resin composition with which hardened materials which have excellent<br>
staining resistance outdoors can be obtained (see Patent Citation 4) . However, in this case there is a weakness in that even though a lower nuclear melamine resin is used for the hardening agent and an acid catalyst which has been blocked with amine in an amount equimolar with the aromatic sulfonic acid is used, the wrinkle pattern finish of the hardened material is not stable.<br>

[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Resolved by the Invention]<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention is intended to provide resin compositions which can be used in wrinkle pattern paints with which paint films of which the wrinkled pattern finish of the paint film has excellent aging<br>
stability and which, moreover, have excellent staining resistance even when used outdoors can be formed. [Means of Resolving These Problems] [0008]<br>
As a result of a thorough investigation carried out with a view to resolving the abovementioned problems, the inventors have discovered that by setting the mol ratio of the sulfonic acid and the tertiary amine compound used for blocking the sulfonic acid within specified range and incorporating specified particle-like or fiber-like aggregate, the wrinkle pattern finish of the paint film is stable with the passage of time and, in addition, they have discovered that even when a specified organosilicate, condensate thereof or partial hydrolyzate of said condensate is incorporated the stability of the wrinkle pattern finish is not lost and the staining resistance is improved, and the invention is based upon these discoveries. [0009]<br>
That is to say, the present invention provides a resin composition which contains (A) hydroxyl group containing polyester resin of which the hydroxyl group value is from 5 to 200 mgKOH/g and the number average molecular weight is from 500 to 20,000, (B) hexakis-alkoxymethylated melamine resin, (C) de-watering agent, (D)  blocked sulfonic acid compound which has been<br>
blocked with a tertiary amine compound of boiling point from 50 to 3 00°C where the mol ratio with respect to the sulfonic acid is from 0.2 to 0.9, (E) silicate compound and (F) at least one material selected from among (a) organic resin particles of average particle diameter not more than 40 µm, (b) inorganic glass particles of average particle diameter not more than 100 µm and (c) inorganic fibers of average length not more than 3 00 µm which is characterized in that the mass ratio of the (A) component and the (B) component as the solid fractions is from 60/40 to 90/10 and, per 100 parts by mass of the total solid fraction of the (A) component and the (B) component, the amount of the (C) component included as solid fraction is from 0.1 to 10 parts by mass, the amount of the (D) component included as solid fraction is from 0.1 to 5 parts by mass, the amount of the (E) component included as solid fraction is from 0.5 to 10 parts by mass and the amount of the (F) component included as solid fraction is from 1 to 3 0 parts by mass. [0010]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a resin composition in which, in the abovementioned resin composition, the silicate compound of the (E) component is an organosilicate which can be represented by the general formula (1) which is indicated below, an organosilicate which can be represented by general<br>
formula (2) which is indicated below, a condensate of either one or both of the two types of organosilicate indicated above,  or a partial hydrolyzate of  said condensate. General Formula (1)<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
(In this formula R1 is a phenyl group or an alkyl group which has from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and R2 is an alkyl group which has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.) General Formula (2)<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
(In this formula R3 is hydrogen or an alkyl group which has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.)<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
[0011]<br>
If a resin composition of this invention is used in a wrinkle pattern paint then a paint film with a wrinkle pattern finish where the wrinkle pattern of the paint film has excellent aging stability and of which the staining resistance is also excellent can be obtained.<br>
[Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
[0012]<br>
The present invention is a resin composition which contains (A) specified hydroxyl group containing polyester resin, (B) hexakis-alkoxymethylated melamine resin, (C) de-watering agent, (D) specified blocked sulfonic acid compound which has been blocked with a specified tertiary amine, (E) silicate compound and (F) specified particles and/or fibers, and it can be used as a resin composition for wrinkle pattern paints. [0013]<br>
In this invention the hydroxyl group containing polyester resin which forms the (A) component is a resin which functions as the base resin of a resin composition for wrinkle pattern paints and which manifests the basic performance (flexibility, hardness, durability and the like) of the paint film which is formed, and it reacts with the (B) component melamine resin. [0014]<br>
The hydroxyl group value of the (A) component hydroxyl group containing polyester resin is from 5 to 200 mgKOH/g, preferably from 10 to 150 mgKOH/g and most desirably from 2 0 to 100 mgKOH/g. If the hydroxyl group value is less than 5 mgKOH/g then the degree of crosslinking in the hardened paint film is too low and so the solvent resistance performance is poor, and if the hydroxyl group value exceeds 2 00 mgKOH/g then the<br>
crosslink density in the hardened paint film is too high and so the workability is reduced.<br>
The number average molecular weight of the (A) component hydroxyl group containing polyester resin is from 500 to 20,000, preferably from 700 to 15,000 and most desirably from 1,000 to 10,000. If the number average molecular weight is less than 500 then the crosslink density in the hardened paint film is too high and so the workability is reduced, and if the number average molecular weight exceeds 20,000 then the crosslink density in the hardened paint film is too low and so the solvent resistance performance is poor. [0015]<br>
The (A) component hydroxyl group containing polyester resin can be obtained using a known method such as the direct esterification method, the ester exchange method or the ring-opening polymerization method for example. In those cases where the resins are synthesized using the direct esterification method by the polycondensation of polybasic carboxylic acids and polyhydric alcohols, examples of the polybasic carboxylic acids include dibasic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid and the like and the anhydrides of these acids, and tri- and poly-basic carboxylic acids such trimellitic<br>
acid, pyromellitic acid and the like and the anhydrides of  these  acids.     Furthermore,  examples  of  the polyhydric alcohols  include diols  such as  ethylene glycol,   propylene   glycol,    diethylene   glycol, butanediol,  neopentyl  glycol,  1,4-hexanediol,  1,6-hexanediol,  cyclohexanedimethylol  and the like,  and tri-  and  poly-hydric  alcohols  such  as  glycerine, trimethylolethane,  trimethylolpropane,  pentaerythritol and the like. [0016]<br>
The (A) component hydroxyl group containing polyester resin can also be obtained by means of polycondensation with ester exchange between polyhydric alcohols and the lower alkyl esters of a polybasic carboxylic acids. Moreover, the (A) component hydroxyl group containing polyester resin can also be obtained by means of the ring-opening polymerization of a lactone such as |3-propiolactone, 5-valerolactone, e-caprolactone and the like. [0017]<br>
In this invention the (B) component hexakis-alkoxymethylated melamine resin fulfils the role of reacting with the hydroxyl groups of the (A) component and forming a crosslinked structure and the role of imparting a wrinkle pattern to the paint film. The (B) component hexakis-alkoxymethylated melamine resin is a methylated melamine resin which has six alkoxyl groups.<br>
The methylated melamine resins are compounds which have six methylol groups where formaldehyde has been added to the three amino groups of the melamine ring, and the (B) component hexakis-alkoxymethylated melamine resins are compounds where the aforementioned six methylol groups have been further alkoxylated.<br>
The six terminal alkyl groups of the (B) component (the alkyl groups on the hexakis-alkoxyl groups) may be methyl groups, isopropyl groups, n-butyl groups or the like, but they are most desirably methyl groups.<br>
Examples  of  commercially  available  hexakis-methylated melamine resins include Cymel 3 00, Cymel 3 03 (trade names,  produced by the Nippon Cytech Co.), Nikarack MW-3 0  (trade name,  produced by the Sanwa Chemical Co.) and the like. [0018]<br>
In this invention the mass ratio of the (A) component and the (B) component as solid fractions is from 60/40 to 90/10, preferably from 70/30 to 90/10, and most desirably from 75/25 to 85/15. In those cases where the mass ratio of the (A) component and the (B) component as solid fractions is such that the proportion of the (A) component is lower than 60/40, the flexible resin component is inadequate and so satisfactory workability is not obtained, and in those cases where the proportion of the (A) component is higher than 90/10 the paint film crosslinking component<br>
is inadequate and the solvent resistance is reduced. [0019]<br>
In this invention the de-watering agent which is the (C) component extracts water from the system and maintains the stability of the agent which provides a hydrophilic nature which reacts readily with water. Examples of the de-watering agent include chemical de-watering  agents  such  as  trimethyl  orthoformate, triethyl orthoformate, trimethyl orthoacetate, triethyl orthoacetate, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, 3-ethyl-2-methyl-2-(3-methylbutyl)-1,3-oxolidine   and   the   like,   and molecular  sieves  as  physical  de-watering  agents. Furthermore,  examples of commercially available de-watering agents include OFE,  OFM, MOA,  2,2-DMP,  EOA (all trade names, produced by the Hitaka Kagaku Co.), ZOLDINE, MS-PLUS (trade names, produced by the American Angus Co.) and the like.  One of these or a mixture of two or more types can be used. [0020]<br>
In this invention the blocked sulfonic acid compound which has been blocked with a specified proportion of a tertiary amine compound which is the (D) component is a compound where a specified proportion of the sulfonic acid is formed as the salt of a tertiary amine and a specified proportion of the action of the sulfonic acid as a catalyst has been temporarily blocked.  That is to say, the sulfonic acid<br>
is a reaction catalyst for the (A) component and the (B) component and it shortens the reaction time, creates a large difference between the surface hardening and the hardening of the interior of the paint film and makes a good wrinkle pattern, but by forming a salt with a tertiary amine this catalytic action is temporarily blocked.<br>
The boiling point of the tertiary amine which is used in the blocked sulfonic acid compound which has been blocked with a tertiary amine which is the (D) component is from 50 to 3 00°C, and preferably from 80 to 150°C. In those cases where the boiling point of the tertiary amine is less than 50°C the volatility is high and the stability of the finish of the wrinkle pattern falls with the passage of painting time, and in those cases where it exceeds 300°C the volatility is low and so it is difficult to form a wrinkle pattern. [0021]<br>
Examples of the tertiary amine of the (D) component include triethylamine, tributylamine, triallylamine, N-methyldiallylamine, N-methyl-morpholine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-diaminoethane, N-methylpiperidine, pyridine and 4-ethylpyridine. One of these can be used alone or a mixture of two or more types can be used, but the use of triethylamine is especially desirable.<br>
Examples of the sulfonic acids which can be used<br>
in the (D) component include p-toluene sulfonic acid, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalene di-sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid and dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acid, and one of these can be used alone or a mixture of two or more types can be used. p-Toluene sulfonic acid is especially desirable. [0022]<br>
One of the main distinguishing features of the present invention is that the mol ratio of the tertiary amine compound with respect to the sulfonic acid for blocking the sulfonic acid with a tertiary amine compound is set to from 0.2 to 0.9, and preferably to from 0.3 to 0.8.<br>
In those cases where the mol ratio of tertiary amine compound with respect to the sulfonic acid is less than 0.2 the amount of tertiary amine is insufficient and a good wrinkle pattern finish cannot be formed, and in those cases where it exceeds 0.9 there is a large amount of tertiary amine and the stability of the agent which provides a hydrophilic nature is reduced.<br>
The mol ratio of the tertiary amine compound with respect to the sulfonic acid and the particle-like or fiber-like aggregate for the (F) component which is used in the invention are closely related to the stability of the wrinkle pattern finish. [0023]<br>
In this invention the (F) component contributes to the formation of a good wrinkle pattern finish and the stabilization of the finish, and in practical terms at least one type of material selected from among  (a) organic resin particles of average particle diameter not more than 40 µm, (b) inorganic glass particles of average particle diameter not more than 100 µm, and (c) inorganic fibers of average length not more than 3 00 µm can be used. [0024]<br>
The average particle diameter of the organic resin particles (a) is preferably not more than 40 µm, more desirably not more than 35 µm, and most desirably not more than 3 0 µm. In those cases where the average particle diameter exceeds 40 µm the appearance of the paint film is poor. A lower limiting value of 1 µm or above is generally preferred for the average particle diameter of the organic resin particles. Examples of commercially available organic resin particles include Techpolymer MBX-5, MBX-12, MBX-3 0 (trade names, produced by the Sekisui Kaseiki Kogyo Co.) and the like. [0025]<br>
The average particle diameter of the inorganic glass particles (b) is preferably not more than 100 µm, more desirably not more than 80 µm, and most desirably not more than 50 µm.  In those cases where the average<br>
particle diameter of the inorganic glass particles exceeds 100 µm the appearance of the paint film is poor. A lower limiting value of 1 urn or above is generally preferred for the average particle diameter of the inorganic glass particles. Examples of commercially available inorganic glass particles include Crystallite AA, W-S, VX-S2 (trade names, produced by the Tatsumori Co.), Greendensic #600, #800, #1200 (trade names, produced by the Showa Denko Co.) and the like. [0026]<br>
The average length of the inorganic fibers (c) is preferably not more than 3 00 urn, but more desirably the average length is not more than 250 µm and most desirably the average length is not more than 2 00 µm. In those cases where the average length of the inorganic fibers exceeds 3 00 µm the appearance of the paint film is poor. A lower limiting value of 5 µm or above is generally preferred for the average length of the inorganic fibers. An average diameter from 1 to 40 µm is generally preferred for the inorganic fibers.<br>
Examples  of  commercially  available  inorganic fibers  include  Safestrand REVl,  REV4,  REV8  (trade names, produced by the Nippon Plate Glass Co.), EGP200, EGP-200-10,   EFH-100-31,   EFH150-31   (trade   names, produced by the Central Glass Co.) and the like. [0027]<br>
In this invention a silicate compound is used for the (E) component. The (E) component is for rendering the paint film surface hydrophilic and improving the staining resistance performance.<br>
The organosilicates which can be represented by general formula (1) and general formula (2) which are indicated below, condensates of either one or both of the abovementioned types of organosilicate, or partial hydrolyzates of said condensates are preferably used for the organosilicate compound of the (E) component.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
[0028]<br>
In general formula (1), R1 is a phenyl group or an alkyl group which has from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl group is preferably from 1 to 14 and most desirably from 1 to 9. If organosilicates and/or condensates thereof in which the number of carbon atoms of the organic group represented by R1 exceeds 18 are used then satisfactory surface orientation when forming a paint film is not obtained and so the paint film surface does not become hydrophilic and good staining resistance performance is not obtained.<br>
Furthermore, R2 in general formula (1) or R3 in general formula (2) is an alkyl group which has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and preferably an alkyl group which has from 1 to 3 carbon atoms or R3 is hydrogen' . If organosilicates and/or condensates thereof in which the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl groups represented by R2 or R3 exceeds 6 are used then the hydrolysis rate is very slow. [0029]<br>
Actual examples of organosilicates of the above-mentioned general formula (1) include trimethoxybutyl-silane, trimethoxyethylsilane and the like.<br>
Actual examples of silicates or organosilicates of the abovementioned general formula (2) include tetra-hydroxysilane, tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetrapropoxysilane, tetrabutoxysilane, tetraphenoxy-silane, dimethoxydiethoxysilane and the like.<br>
One of these or a combination of two or more types can be used. [0030]<br>
Furthermore, the branched or linear condensates obtained by condensing one type, or two or more types, of organosilicate which can be represented by the aforementioned general formula (1) and general formula (2), and preferably the linear condensates where the degree of condensation is from 2 to 100, can be used as condensates of the organosilicates.  If the degree of<br>
condensation exceeds 100 then there is little effect on the staining resistance and, furthermore, the workability is also reduced and so this is undesirable. The condensates of organosilicates used in the invention most desirably have a degree of condensation of from 2 to 50.<br>
Examples of commercially available organosilicate condensates include MKC Silicate MS51, MS56, MS57, MS58B15 (trade names, produced by the Mitsubishi Kagaku Co.), Ethylsilicate 40, Ethylsilicate 48, EMS-485 (trade names, produced by the Colcoat Co.) and the like. [0031]<br>
The preferred proportions in which the (C) to (F) components are included in a resin composition of this invention are, per 100 parts by mass in total as the solid  fraction  of  the  (A)  component  and  the  (B) component,  from 0.1 to 10 parts by mass as solid fraction of the (C) component de-watering agent, from 0.1 to 5 parts by mass as solid fraction of the (D) component blocked sulfonic acid compound, from 0.5 to 10 parts by mass as solid fraction of the (E) component silicate compound and from 1 to 3 0 parts by mass as solid fraction of the (F) component particle-like or fiber-like aggregate.<br>
Most desirably the (C) component content is from 0.5 to 5 parts by mass, and if there is less than 0.1<br>
part by mass the de-watering action is inadequate and the stability of the agent providing hydrophilicity is inadequate, and finish stability of the wrinkle pattern is not obtained in those cases where it exceeds 10 parts by mass. [0032]<br>
Most desirably the (D) component content is from 0.3 to 5 parts by mass, and if it is less than 0.1 part by mass then satisfactory hardening does not occur, and in those cases where it exceeds 5 parts by mass the stability of the agent which provides hydrophilicity is reduced by the excess tertiary amine compound.<br>
Most desirably the (E) component content is from 0.5 to 5 parts by mass, and if it is less than 0.5 part by mass then the surface does not become adequately hydrophilic and so good staining resistance performance is not obtained, and in those cases where it exceeds 10 parts by mass the water resistance performance declines.<br>
Most desirably the (F) component content is from 5 to 25 parts by mass, and if it is less than 1 part by mass then a stable wrinkle pattern finish cannot be formed, and in those cases where it exceeds 3 0 parts by mass the workability is reduced. [0033]<br>
In addition to the abovementioned essential components,   inorganic  pigments  such  as  titanium<br>
dioxide, carbon black, iron oxide, chrome yellow and the like,  organic pigments  such as  cyanine green, cyanine blue and the like,  metal powders such as aluminum powder,  copper powder and the like,  true pigments such as barium sulfate, talc, mica and the like,  additives  such as pigment dispersing agents, leveling  agents,  anti-settling  agents,  antifoaming agents and the like, and one or more solvent may be included in a resin composition of this invention, as required. [0034]<br>
The resin compositions of this invention can be produced by mixing the abovementioned components together. In terms of the method of painting it is possible to form a paint film which has a wrinkle pattern by diluting with a solvent such as xylol for example, as required, to achieve the painting viscosity and then carrying out painting and baking for from 20 to 12 0 seconds at a temperature of from 2 00 to 3 00°C. The paint film obtained has good workability and since it is baked for a short time it is suitable as a paint for pre-coated metals, but it is not limited to this application and it can also be used as a paint for post-coating purposes. [0035]<br>
In those cases where a resin composition of this invention is used as a clear or a color-clear paint it<br>
may be painted directly onto a base material such as steel, galvanized steel sheet, stainless steel, aluminum or the like, or it may be painted on a base material which has been painted with a primer, and furthermore it may be painted onto the usual pre-coated metal steel sheets. A wrinkle pattern paint of this invention can be coated using a bar coater, a flow coater, a roll coater, a roll flow coater, a spray gun or the like. Furthermore, these paints can also be used for embossed steel sheets for improving the design potential. [0036]<br>
When, after painting on a resin composition of this invention, the composition is baked at a high temperature of from 200 to 3 00°C, the blocking tertiary amine compound is released from the paint film close to the surface and evaporates and the sulfonic acid which is released at the same time recovers its catalytic action and the hardening reaction occurs early just in the surface layer and, as a result, a paint film which has a wrinkle pattern is obtained, and the heating and hardening is completed in a short time of from 20 to 120 seconds. The paint film which is produced has crepe-like fine roughness of unspecified direction in two dimensions, and the size and form etc. of the roughness vary with the composition of the wrinkle pattern paint,  the  film  thickness  and  the  baking<br>
conditions for example, and by adjusting these factors a paint film which has any wrinkle pattern can be obtained.   Furthermore,  the paint film obtained has excellent workability, adhesion, corrosion resistance, staining resistance and the like, and even if working is  carried  out  after  paint  film  formation  the appearance,    workability,    adhesion,    corrosion resistance,  staining resistance and the like of the paint film are unchanged. [Illustrative Examples] [0037]<br>

The results obtained on evaluation are shown in Tables 3 and 6 . [0044]<br>
Furthermore, the property evaluation of the paint films obtained with the paint compositions of this invention was carried out using the methods outlined below. (1) Workability<br>
The test piece was cut to a width of 5 cm and, at a room temperature of 20°C, flexed through 180° with nothing on the inside as 0T, with one sheet the same as the test piece on the inside as IT or with two sheets the same as the test piece on the inside as 2T with the paint film on the outside. Furthermore, flexing was carried out through 180° with four sheets the same as the test piece on the inside as 4T with the paint film<br>
on the outside.  Evaluation was carried out by means of subsequent peeling with cellophane tape. O: No peeling at all.<br>
A: Peeling was seen over an area of less than 10%. X: 10% or more peeling was seen. [0045]<br>
(2)	Hydrophilicity<br>

O: The wrinkle pattern had a rough feel, the pattern was uniform and even after six hours had passed after adding the agent for providing a hydrophilic nature there was no change in these properties and good design potential was maintained.<br>
X: No rough feel of a wrinkle pattern immediately after adding the agent providing a hydrophilic nature or after 6 hours had passed after adding the agent providing a hydrophilic nature, or the pattern was irregular and the design potential was poor. [0047]<br>
(4)	Solvent Resistance<br>
The painted surface of a painted steel sheet was wiped 100 times with a gauze which contained xylene while applying a load of 1 kg and the paint surface was observed. The evaluation criteria were as follows. O: No change in the paint surface, solvent resistance good<br>
X: Surface of the paint film dissolved in the xylene, solvent resistance poor [0048]<br>
(5)	Water Resistance<br>
