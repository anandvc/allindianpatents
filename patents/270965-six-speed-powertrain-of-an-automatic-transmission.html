				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel controlled release pharmaceutical compositions and process of preparation of such compositions comprising a core wherein the said core comprises at least one active agent(s) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, isomers, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, analogues enantiomers, tautomeric forms or mixtures thereof, a lipid system comprising at least one lipid component(s), at least one water insoluble release modifier(s), at least one channel forming agent(s) and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and at least one coat, wherein the composition provides therapeutic concentrations of active agent(s) for extended periods of time Particularly the present invention relates to compositions comprising alfuzosin or pramipexole or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, analogues, enantiomers, tautomeric forms or mixtures thereof Further, this invention relates to process of preparation of such novel compositions and method of using them<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The advantages of controlled release products are well-known in the pharmaceutical field and include the ability to release the medicament in a controlled manner over a period of time while increasing patient compliance by reducing the number of administrations necessary to achieve the same levtl Several controlled release compositions for delivering different pharmaceutically active ingredients and involving different release mechanisms had been described previously<br>
US patent no 4,851,232 describes a hydrogel reservoir containing tiny pills having an active agent core surrounded by a wall controlling delivery of active agent to the stomach The hydrogel swells in the stomach to facilitate retention of the active agent reservoir in the stomach over time US patent no 4,871,548 describes a dosage form including a mixture of low and high number average molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers and active agent that swells when in the stomach US patent no 6,548,083 describes a gastro-retenttve controlled release dosage form comprising an active agent and a polymer matrix formed of a mixture of a swellable, water soluble polymer US publication no 2004185105 describes a method for selecting an optimized controlled release dosage form for administration to a patient having a predetermined drug release profile in vivo by preparing a plurality of different candidate dosage forms each comprised of a biocompatible hydrophilic polymer and a pharmacologically active agent incorporated therein US patent no 5 007 790 describes a sustained-release oral drug dosage form for releasing a solution of drug into the stomach comprising a plurality of solid particles of a solid-state drug dispersed within a hydrophilic, water-swellable polymer<br>
Alfuzosin acts as a selective and competitive antagonist of alpha-1 adrenoceptor mediated contraction of prostatic capsule bladder base and proximal urethral structures and used in the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia Alfuzosin is reported to be absorbed preferentially in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, being absorbed in the duodenum and the jejunum Alfuzosin is conventionally administered three times per day as 2 5 mg immediate release tablet dosage form Hence, sustained release compositions of alfuzosin provide various advantages over conventional multiple dosing including better patient compliance reduced fluctuations of plasma drug levels and reduced toxicity A once daily formulation of alfuzosin (10mg), Xatral®-XL (available in Europe) and UroXatral® (available in the US), provides equivalent systemic exposure when compared to the 2 5 mg immediate release tablet dosage form of alfuzosin administered thrice daily The alfuzosin 5 mg extended release dosage form may be given to adults twice daily, with the first dose taken at bedtime Pramipexole is a non-ergot dopamine agonist indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson s disease Pramipexole is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak concentrations in approximately 2 hours The absolute bioavailability of pramipexole is greater than 90%, indicating that it is well absorbed and undergoes little presystolic metabolism Pramipexole is extensively distributed and displays linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dosage range Its terminal half-life is about 8 hours in young healthy volunteers and about 12 hours in elderly volunteers<br>
Biguamdes such as Metformin is an antthyperglycemic agent, which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type-2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization<br>
Sulfonylureas such as Glibenclamide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets The combination of sulfonylurea and metformin may have a synergistic effect, since both agents act to improve glucose tolerance by different but complementary mechanisms Rosiglitazone a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents, improves glycemic control by improving insulin sensitivity Rosiglitazone is a highly selective and potent agonist for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma In humans, PPAR receptors are found in key target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver Activation<br>
of PPAR-gamma nuclear receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization<br>
US patent no 6,149, 940 discloses a preparation of an alfuzosin 10 mg once daily composition for oral delivery using a technology termed Geomatnx that has been developed by Jagotec-AG The three-layer Geomatnx tablet consists of a hydrophilic active matrix core containing alfuzosin hydrochloride and two inert, functional layers, one swellable layer and one erodible layer, whose functions are to control the hydration and swelling rate of the core, and thereby controlling the dissolution of the drug When the tablet comes into contact with gastric juices, it increases considerably in volume and thus remains in the stomach for a longer time In this manner, most of the drug is absorbed in a controlled manner in the portion of the gastrointestinal tract having the highest capacity for absorption Alfuzosin is released in zero order from the dosage form developed using this technology However, the manufacture of multi-layered tablets by this technology involves highly skilled personals, special facilities, is time consuming, complex to produce, and hence, relatively expensive as compared to simple matrix type single layered tablets Hence, developing controlled release dosage form of alfuzosin as described in the present invention particularly using two functional excipients are simple and convenient process as compared to the manufacture of multi-layered tablets<br>
US patent no 5,589, 190 discloses a pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least one coated core that contains alfuzosin hydrochloride, which core is coated with a coating that contains a polymer that is insoluble in acid and soluble at pH 7 or above, and at least one uncoated core containing alfuzosin hydrochloride Thus the sustained release of a part of alfuzosin from the said composition is governed by the coating Further, the said patent discloses a combination of two types of tablets one coated and the other uncoated with different release rates that are filled into hard gelatin capsules These formulations, however, have several disadvantages including the need for strict process controls during their manufacture and unpredictability in cumulative drug release profile<br>
The PCT publication bearing no WO2004/037228 discloses a sustained release oral dosage form comprising a single functional layer, and optionally, one or more nonfunctional layers adjacent to the single functional layer, wherein the single functional layer comprises alfuzosin and one or more release retarding ingredients such as one or more of cellulosic polymers, methacrylate polymers, acrylic acid polymers, block copolymers, gums and polyethylene oxide The nonfunctional layer does not contain drug but one non-functional layer (first layer) acts as a swelling<br>
layer and other comprises hydrophobic material (third layer) like hydrogenated castor oil glyceryl monostearate or wax used to slow down the penetration of water and or aqueous fluids into the second layer containing the active substance and into the first and third layer The said publication primarily describes the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) polymer as release retarding agent This system works by initial swelling of matrix followed by erosion of gelled layers to produce the zero order release pattern of the drug The said PCT application thus specifically teaches the use of HPMC to produce a hydrophilic core based system in the form of single matrix tablets EP 700285 discloses drug delivery compositions of alpha adrenoceptor blocking agents that have a biphasic drug release profile This patent teaches matrix compositions using HPMC and a coating designed to dissolve in the colonic environment<br>
The PCT publication bearing no WO 200565641 discloses a non-disintegrating, non-eroding, non-bioadhesive and non-swelling oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one high dose water soluble active ingredient, at least one diluent, at least one binder, and a polymer system comprising of at least one release controlling polymer optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients However, the core matrix compositions described in the said publication are particularly hydrophilic in nature due to the substantially high content of the water soluble active agent present in the core composition Moreover the compositions disclosed are particularly uncoated compositions, and thus the rate of release of the active agent from the composition is solely controlled by the hydrophilic core matrix<br>
The PCT publication bearing no WO 200469228 relates to a sustained release tablet formulation comprising venlafaxine, a sustained release agent selected from povidone, a mixture of povidone and polyvinyl acetate, hydrogenated vegetable oil, polyethylene glycol, glyceryl behenate and glyceryl palmitostearate and a lubricant optionally in combination with a filling material and/or other excipients The said publication does not disclose the use of methacrylate polymers such as Eudragits® to prepare the matrix compositions Specifically disclosed are sustained release film coated tablet formulation wherein the film coating comprises polymethacrylate such as Eudragit which are hydrophobic and water insoluble in nature<br>
Although several prior art literature is available on controlled release delivery systems particularly for water soluble drugs, most of them relate to the use of hydrophilic swellable polymers to make a core comprising the active agent that controls the release of the active or the use of a coating composition particularly comprising polymers that exhibit pH dependent solubility to control the release of the active agent Most of the prior art compositions do not<br>
provide solution to control the initial 'burst release of the water soluble active agent from the core composition which is highly essential to provide a gradual release of the active agent for extended time duration Hence such systems fail to provide desired gradual controlled release profiles of water soluble drugs over extended periods of time No prior art could be found which describes a controlled release composition comprising a water soluble drug wherein the desired controlled drug release is governed by not only the core matrix composition but also by a hydrophilic pH independent coating composition Hence, there still exists a need for developing controlled release system for delivery of drugs which releases the drug in vivo in a specific manner independent of the pH of the gastric environment The novel compositions of the present invention overcome the limitations of the prior art<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition comprising a core wherein the core comprises at least one water soluble active agent(s) or its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, analogues, enantiomers, tautomeric forms or mixtures thereof, a Lipid system comprising at least one lipid component(s), at least one water insoluble release modifier(s), at least one channel forming agent(s), and optionally, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and at least one coat, wherein the composition provides therapeutic concentrations of active agent(s) for extended periods of time In an embodiment of the present invention the coat comprises at least one hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s), optionally with one or more pharmaceutical ly acceptable excipients<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the novel controlled release pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprises a core and a coat, wherein the core is formulated as a hydrophobic, non-swellable matrix system which controls the rate of release of active agent(s) and the coat comprising of at least one layer provided on the core is formulated as a hydrophilic pH independent system which primarily prevents the initial burst release of the active agent(s), the said composition thus providing therapeutic concentrations of active agent(s) for extended periods of time In an embodiment, the core composition is preferably formulated as a substantially non-erodible matrix system from which the release of the active agent takes place primarily by diffusion The coating composition is preferably formulated such that it gets hydrated when exposed to the gastro-intestinal environment and forms a gel-like layer which prevents the initial burst release of the active agent(s) and then also controls the release of the active agent(s) tor the initial period The degree and rate of hydration of the hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s) in the coat governs the initial release pattern of the active agent(s) In an embodiment the coating layer preferably erodes gradually after about 2-8 hours of administration to a subject thus exposing the core matrix composition from which the active agent(s) diffuses out into the gastro-intestinal tract in the desired controlled manner for an extended time period<br>
In an embodiment the hydrophobicity of the core is primarily due to the presence of a substantially high concentration of the lipophilic components and/or the water insoluble release modifier(s) Preferably the core composition of the present invention has been devised in such a<br>
manner that the release of the active agent(s) from the core matrix takes place predominantly by diffusion particularly through the channels in the coat comprising at least one hydrophilic pH independent polymer which allows the slow introduction of aqueous fluids into the core, thereby controlling the rate of initial drug release from the core gradually in the desired manner for an extended period of time into the desired environment irrespective of the pH of the environment<br>
In another embodiment the composition of the present invention behaves as a gastro-retentive system wherein the gastro-retentivity is achieved by mucoadhesion, floatation and/or increasing the residence time of the composition in the gastro-intestinal tract particularly the stomach The coating composition preferably provides mucoadhesivity to the compositions of the present invention Further, the core composition of the present invention might be formulated in such a manner which leads to floatation of the dosage form in the contents of the gastro-intestinal tract for an extended duration by suitably selecting the nature and quantities of the excipients used to formulate the composition In a further embodiment, the increase in the residence time of the composition in the gastro-intestinal tract particularly the stomach is achieved by incorporating a fatty component such as a triglyceride in the composition or administering the composition with food However, the formulation of the composition of the present invention as a gastro-retentive system by one or more methods depends on the nature, site of absorption and desired activity of the active agent(s) present in the composition This particular phenomenon of gastro-retention may help in the increased rate and extent of absorption of active agent(s) from the gastrointestinal tract For example, alfuzosin is reported to be absorbed more in the proximal upper parts of the tract (duodenum and jejunum) and hence such a phenomenon might contribute to enhancement of absorption and improved bioavailability of the said active agent<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the water soluble active agent(s) used are particularly those which possess acceptable aqueous solubility selected from but not limited to a group comprising alfuzosin, pramipexole lamotrigine, bumetanide, niacin, metformin, diltiazem, buspirone, tramadol, gabapentin, verapamil, metoprolol, carbidopa, levodopa, carbamazepine, morphine, pseudoephednne, cisapride, pilocarpine, methylphenidate, nifedipine, nicardipine, felodipine, captopril, terfenadine, pentoxifylline, fenofibrate, acyclovir, zidovudine moclobemide, potassium chloride, citalopram, cladnbine, loratadine, pancrelipase, lithium carbonate orphenadnne, ketoprofen, procainamide, ferrous sulfate, nefazodone, lovastatin, simvastatin pravachol hydromorphone ticlopidine selegiline alprazolam, divalproex, phenytoin   nitroglycerine   isosorbide  and the like or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts<br>

In an embodiment, the present invention provides novel controlled release pharmaceutical composition comprising a core wherein the core comprises alfuzosm or pramipexole or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs solvates hydrates, analogues, enantiomers tautomeric forms or mixtures thereof, a lipid system comprising at least one lipid component(s), at least one water insoluble release modifier(s), at least one channel forming agent(s), and optionally, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and a coat wherein the coat comprises at least one hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s), optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and wherein the composition provides therapeutic concentrations of active agent(s) for extended periods of time<br>
The lipid system used to formulate the core composition of the present invention comprises at least one lipid component which is preferably a waxy material and aids in providing a controlled release of the active agent The lipid system of the present invention comprises one or more excipients that are particularly lipophilic in nature The components of the lipid system primarily help in providing a lipid based matrix system comprising the active agent Examples of lipid component used in the present invention include but not limited to glyceryl behenate such as Compntol® AT0888, Compntol® HD AT05, and the like, hydrogenated vegetable oil such as hydrogenated castor oil e g Lubntab® and the like, and glyceryl palmitostearate such as Precirol® AT05 and the like, waxes such as carnuba wax, beeswax, and the like, fatty substances such as one or more triglycerides, or mixtures thereof The lipid component is preferably a non-digestible lipid constituting about 5-90% by weight of the total composition and helps in releasing active agent for a desired time period particularly with a pH independent release profile<br>
In an embodiment, the water insoluble release modifier used in the core composition of the present invention is selected from but not limited to a group comprising methacrylic acid copolymers such as Eudragit® L100/S100/L100-55 and the like, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers such as Eudragit® E100/EPO and the like, ammonioalkyl methacrylate copolymers such as Eudragit® RL100/RL30D/RLPO, Eudragit® RS100/RS30D/RSPO and Eudragit® RD100 and the like or mixtures thereof The use of methacrylic acid copolymers either alone or in specific combinations is governed by the nature of the active agent(s) intended to be used in the compositions of the present invention<br>
The channel forming agent used in the present invention is selected from but not limited to a group comprising lactose, maltodextrin, fructose, sucrose, mannttol, sorbitol and xylitol polyethylene glycol such as PEG 100, PEG 400, PEG 2000, PEG 6000 and PEG 10,000, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium chloride, sodium citrate, citric acid, water soluble celluloses such as low viscosity hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and the like or mixtures thereof<br>
In another embodiment, the coating composition is useful for sustaining the release of the active agent(s) from the core The coating composition comprises of at least one hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s) The hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s) is selected from but not limited to a group comprising cellulose ethers such as methylcellulose hydroxyethylcellulose propylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or its sodium salt, and the like or mixtures thereof Preferably the hydrophilic pH independent polymer is a non-ionic polymer, more preferably a cellulosic polymer In a preferred embodiment, the hydrophilic pH independent polymer used is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose Preferably the hydrophilic pH independent polymer constitutes about 1% to about 99% w/w of the total solid content in the coating composition In an embodiment, the coating composition may optionally contain other pharmaceutical ly acceptable excipients selected from but not limited to a group comprising lubricants, plasticizers and colorants and the like known to the art used either alone or in combination thereof<br>
In an embodiment of the coating composition of the present invention, the hydrophilic pH independent polymer is a low viscosity grade polymer or a high viscosity grade polymer, preferably a high viscosity grade polymer Upon contact with an aqueous environment, the said polymer gets hydrated and controls the initial release of the active agent(s) The site, rate and duration of the release ot the active agent(s) is controlled by varying specific parameters such as<br>
the thickness of the coating and the amount of hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s) used to formulate the coating composition The use of more viscous polymer(s) in the coating composition also aids in increasing the residence time of the composition in the gastro-mtestinal tract Particularly hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is used as the hydrophilic pH independent polymer(s) in the coating composition A low viscosity hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is defined as one having preferably a molecular weight of 55,000 or greater and viscosity of 800 mPas or less A high viscosity hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is defined as one having preferably a molecular weight of 60 000 or greater and viscosity of 1000 mPas or greater A mixture of low viscosity and high viscosity hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers may also be used to formulate the coating composition of the present invention<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the active agent(s) is released mainly by diffusion mechanism from the composition comprising a core and at least one coat The hydrophilic pH independent polymer preferably the high viscosity (high molecular weight) HPMC in the coat of the composition upon contact with the aqueous fluids gets wet and the HPMC begins to hydrate, forming a gel-like layer Over a period of time the aqueous fluid permeates into the coat further and increases the thickness of the gel-like layer Further hydration of the coat will lead to fully hydrated coat layer and at the same time core is also simultaneously hydrated This phenomenon provides barrier to the initial burst release of the active agent(s) from the core tablet The drug being water soluble in nature shall diffuse through the gel-like layer initially Any further hydration to the fully hydrated gel layer leads to dissolution of the loose gel-like layer into the aqueous fluids and hence, during this period drug release from the coated layer may be by both diffusion and erosion It was observed that the hydrated gel-like layer almost completely eroded in less than about 6 hours in the in vitro dissolution media (0 01N HC1 or pH 6 8 phosphate buffer) irrespective of dissolution method The aqueous fluids continue to permeate towards the inner core composition to achieve sustained release of the active agent(s) by diffusion mechanism The core matrix composition comprising a lipid component such as glyceryl behenate along with an optimum combination of water insoluble release modifier(s) such as Eudragit® RSPO and Eudragit® RLPO and a channel former(s) provides sustained release of active agent(s) Presence of a combination of water insoluble release modifier(s) and channel former(s) provides desired intactness to the lipid matrix composition and thereby aids in both initial as well as later stages of the drug release from the lipid matrix system by diffusion mechanism to achieve completeness of release of active agent(s)<br>
