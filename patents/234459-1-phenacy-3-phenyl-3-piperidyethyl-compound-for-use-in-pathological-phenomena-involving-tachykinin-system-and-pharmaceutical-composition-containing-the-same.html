  "A COMPOUND"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO,   of   174,   Avenue   de   France,   F-75013   Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
WO 00/47572<br><br>
PCT/FR00/00284<br><br>
(1-PHENACY-3-PHENYL-3-PIPERIDYLETHYL): PIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR OBTAINING THEM AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM<br>
5	The present invention relates to novel<br>
piperidine derivatives, to a process for preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active principle.<br>
More particularly, the present invention <br>
10  	relates to novel piperidine derivatives for therapeutic use in pathological phenomena involving the tachykinin system, such as, in a non-limiting manner: pain (L- Urban et al., TINS, 1994, 11_,   432-438; L. Seguin et al.. Pain, 1995, £1, 325-343; S.H. Buck, 1994, The <br>
15  	Tachykinin Receptors, Humana Press, Totowa, New-Jersey), allergy and inflammation (S.H. Buck, 1994, The Tachykinin Receptors, Humana Press, Totowa, New-Jersey) , gastrointestinal disorders (P. Holzer and U. Holzer-Petsche, Pharmacol. Ther., 1997, 13_,    173-217 and 219-<br>
20  	263), respiratory disorders (J. Mizrahi et-al.,<br>
Pharmacology, 1982, 2_5, 39-50; C. Advenier et al., Eur. Respir. J., 1997, H), 1892-1906; C. Advenier and X. Emonds-Alt, Pulmonary Pharmacol., 1996, 9, 329-333), urinary disorders (S.H. Buck, 1994, The Tachykinin <br>
25  	Receptors, Humana Press, Totowa, New-Jersey; C.A. Maggi, Progress in Neurobiology, 1995, 45, 1-98), neurological.<br><br>
disorders and neuropsychiatry disorders {C.A. Maggi et al., J. Autonomic Pharmacol., 1993, 1^, 23-93; M. Otsuka and K. Yoshioka, Physiol. Rev. 1993, 7^3, 229-308).<br>
Many research studies have been carried out in<br>
5  	recent years on tachykinins and their receptors. Tachykinins are distributed both in the central nervous system and in the peripheral nervous system. The tachykinin receptors have been recognized and are classified into three types: NK1, NK2 and NK3. Substance P (SP) is <br>
10  	the endogenous ligand of the NK1 receptors, neurokinin A (NKA) is that of the NK2 receptors and neurokinin B (NKB) is that of the NK3 receptors.<br>
The NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors have been<br>
demonstrated in various species.<br>
15	A review by C.A. Maggi et al. {J. Autonomic<br>
Pharmacol., 1993, ^3-, 23-93) and a review by D. Regoli et" al. (Pharmacol. Rev., 1994, 4_6, 551-599) discuss tachykinin receptors and their antagonists and present the pharmacological studies and the applications in <br>
20  human therapy.<br>
Many patents and patent applications describe compounds that are active on tachykinin receptors. Thus, European patent application 0 512 901 relates to the compounds of formula:<br>
5<br><br><br>
in  which,   in particular:<br>
-	Q' represents  an oxygen atom or two hydrogen atoms,<br>
-	T'  =  -C(0)-  or  -CH2-,   and<br>
5  - Y, Ar", V,   m', n', pp and q have different values.<br>
Patent application EP 0 714 891 relates to the compounds of formula:<br><br>
in which: <br>
10  - p" is 1, 2 or 3;<br>
-	m" and h" are independently 0 to 6;<br>
-	W, Ra/ Rb, Rc/ Rd and Re have different values.<br>
Novel compounds have now been found which have very strong affinity and great selectivity for the human<br>
15  	NK1 receptors of substance P and which are antagonists of the said receptors.<br>
	Furthermore, the compounds according to the<br>
present invention have good bioavailability when they<br>
are administered orally.<br>
20	These compounds can be used to prepare<br><br>
medicinal products that are useful in the treatment of any pathology in which substance P and the NK1 receptors are involved, in particular in the treatment of pathologies of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, <br>
5  	immune, cardiovascular and central nervous systems as well as in the treatment of pain, migraine, inflammations, nausea and vomiting, and skin diseases.<br>

15  as well as the salts thereof, and the solvates and/or hydrates thereof, are more particularly preferred. According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to a process for preparing compounds of formula (I), the salts thereof and the<br>
20  solvates and/or hydrates thereof, characterized in that: la)  a compound of formula:<br><br>
in which Ar is - as' defined for a compound of formula (I) and E represents hydrogen- or an O-protecting group, is <br><br><br>
treated with a functional derivative of an acid of formula:<br><br><br><br>
in which R1 is as defined for a compound of formula (I) , 5  to give a compound of formula:<br><br><br><br>
2a)  optionally, when £ represents a protecting group, it is removed by the action of an acid or a base, to give the alcohol of formula:<br><br>
3a)  the alcohol obtained in step la) or in step 2a) of formula (IV, £ - H) is treated with a compound of formula:<br>
Y"-S02-C1    (V) <br>
15  in which Y represents a methyl, phenyl, tolyl or<br>
trifluoromethyl group, to give a compound of formula:<br><br><br><br>
4a)  the compound of formula (VI) is reacted with a compound of formula:<br><br>
5  	in which X is as defined for a compound of formula (I); 5a)  and, optionally, the compound thus obtained is converted into one of the salts thereof with an inorganic or organic acid.<br>
When E represents an O-protecting group, this<br>
10  	group is chosen from conventional O-protecting groups that are well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, 2-tetrahydropyranyl, benzoyl or a (C1-C4) alkylcarbonyl.<br>
In step la), the functional derivative of the<br>
15  	acid (III) which is used is the acid itself or<br>
alternatively one of the functional derivatives which<br>
react with amines, for example an anhydride, a mixed<br>
anhydride, acid chloride or an activated ester, such as<br>
the para-nitrophenyl ester.<br>
20	When the acid of formula (III) itself is used,<br>
the process is performed in the presence of a coupling agent used in peptide chemistry, such as 1, 3-dicyclo-<br><br>
(VII) is reacted with an aldehyde of formula (VIII) in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, in an inert solvent such as methanol or dichloromethane, to form in situ  an intermediate imine which is reduced chemically <br>
5  	using, for example, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, or reduced catalytically using hydrogen and a catalyst such as palladium-on-charcoal or Raney® nickel.<br>
Finally, the compounds of formula (I) 10  according to the invention are obtained.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) thus obtained are isolated in the form of the free base or in the form of a salt, according to the conventional techniques.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are obtained 15  in the form of the free base, the salification is<br>
carried out by treatment with the acid chosen in an organic solvent. Treatment of the free base, dissolved, for example, in an ether such as diethyl ether or in an alcohol such as 2-propanol or in acetone or in dichloro<br>
20  	methane, or in ethyl acetate, with a solution of the<br>
acid chosen in one of the abovementioned solvents, gives the corresponding salt which is isolated according to the conventional techniques.<br>
Thus, for example, the hydrochloride, the <br>
25  	hydrobromide, the sulphate, the hydrogen sulphate, the dihydrogen phosphate, the methanesulphonate, the methyl<br><br>
sulphate, the oxalate, the maleate, the succinate, tne<br>
fumarate, the 2-naphthalenesulphonate, the benzene-<br>
sulphonate, the para-toluenesulphonate or the gluconate<br>
is prepared.<br>
 5	At the end of the reaction, the compounds of<br>
formula (I) can be isolated in the form of one of the salts thereof, for example the hydrochloride or the oxalate; in this case, if necessary, the free base can be prepared by neutralizing the said salt with an <br>
10  	inorganic or organic base, such as sodium hydroxide or triethylamine or with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, such as sodium or potassium carbonate or bicarbonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are prepared by<br>
15  	known methods, in particular those described in patent applications EP-A-0 512 901, EP-A-0 591 040 or EP-A-0 714 891.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) are commercially available or are prepared according to<br>
20  	known methods.<br>
Thus, for example, the compounds of formula (III) are prepared according to SCHEME 1 below.<br><br><br>
SCHEME 1<br><br>
Steps al and b1 of SCHEME 1 are carried out<br>
according to the methods described in J. Am. C-hem. Soc.<br>
1941; 63, 3280-3282.<br>
5	In step c1_, an ester of formula (XII) is<br>
prepared from an acid of formula (XI) according to the methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The ester (XII) thus obtained is reduced in step dl  to the alcohol of formula (XIII) according to <br>
10  the  methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Steps e1 and f1 are carried out according to the methods described in J. Med. Chem., 1973, 16, 684-687..<br>
The phenylacetonitrile derivatives of formula<br><br>
(XV) thus obtained are hydrolysed in step g1 into<br>
compounds of formula (III) according to the methods<br>
described in J. Org. Chem., 1968, 33,   4288 or in<br>
EP-A-0 714 891.<br>
5	The bromo derivatives of formula (IX) are<br>
known or are prepared according to known methods, such as those described in J. Org. Chem., 1971, 2*&gt;(1) , 193-196, or in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1941, £3, 3280-3282. The compounds of formula (VII) in which X<br>

 and the salts thereof with inorganic or organic acids.<br>
The resolution of the racemic mixtures of the<br>
10  	compounds of formula (I) makes it possible to isolate the enantiomers of formula<br><br>
in which:<br>
- "*" means that the carbon atom thus labelled has the<br>
determined (S) or (R) absolute configuration;<br>
15  - X, Ar and R1 are as defined for a compound of formula (I);<br>
as well as the possible salts thereof with inorganic or organic acids, and the solvates and/or hydrates thereof.<br>
However, it is preferable to carry out the<br>
20  resolution of the racemic mixtures from the intermediate compound of .formula (II, E=H) , which is useful for preparing the compound of formula (I) as described in<br><br>
the patent applications: EP-A-0 512 901, EP-A-0 612 716-and EP-A-0 591 040.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to a stereospecific process <br>
5  	for preparing the compounds of formula (I) having the (S) configuration, the salts thereof and the solvates and/or hydrates thereof, characterized in that: Id) the (S) isomer of a compound of formula:<br><br>

in the presence of an acid, followed by reduction of the<br>
intermediate iminium salt formed by means of a reducing<br>
agent;<br>
4d)- and, optionally, the compound thus obtained is<br>
converted into one of the salts thereof with an<br>
inorganic or organic acid.<br>
10	The compounds of formula (I) above also<br>
comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon atoms have been replaced with their radioactive isotope, for example tritium or carbon-14. Such labelled compounds are useful in research studies, of metabolism<br>
15  	or of pharmacokinetics, in biochemical tests as receptor ligands.     .<br>
The compounds according to the invention . underwent biochemical tests.<br>
The affinity of the compounds for the tachy-<br>
20  	kinin receptors was evaluated in vitro by means of<br><br><br>
several biochemical tests using radio ligands:<br>
1)	The binding of [1251] BH-SP (substance P labelled with<br>
iodine-125 using the Bolton-Hunter reagent) to the NKX<br>
receptors of human lymphoblast cells (D.G. Payan'et al.,<br>
5  J. Immunol., 1984, 13J3, 3260-3265).<br>
2)	The binding of [125I] His-NKA to human NK2 cloned receptors expressed by CHO cells (Y. Takeda et al., J. Neurochern., 1992, 59[, 740-745).<br>
3)	The binding of [125I] His [MePhe'] NKB to the NK3<br>
10  receptors of rat cerebral cortex, of guinea pig cerebral cortex and of gerbil cerebral cortex as well as to the human NK3 cloned receptors expressed by CHO cells (Buell et al., FEBS Letters, 1992, 29J3, 90-95).<br>
The tests were carried out according to X. <br>
15  	Emonds-Alt et al., (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1993, 25£, 403-413; Life Sci., 1995, j&gt;6, PL 27-32).<br>
The compounds according to the invention strongly inhibit the binding of substance P to the NK1 receptors of human IM9 lymphoblast cells. The inhibition <br>
20  	constant Ki for the human lymphoblast cell receptors is of the order of 10-11M.<br>
The inhibition constants Ki for the human NK2 cloned receptors are of the order of 10-7M and the inhibition constants Ki for the human NK3 cloned <br>
25  	receptors are greater than 10-7M.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are powerful and<br><br>
selective antagonists of substance P for the human NK1 receptors.<br>
Thus, the compounds of formula (I) were also<br>
evaluated in vivo on animal models.<br>
 5	in guinea pig striatum, the local application<br>
of an agonist which is specific for the NK1 receptors, for example [Sar9, Met(O2)n]substance P, increases the release of acetylcholine. This release is inhibited by oral or intraperitoneal administration of the compounds<br>
10  	according to the present invention. This test was adapted from the method described by R. Steinberg et al., J- Neurochemistry, 1995, 65, 2543-2548.<br>
These results show that the compounds of formula (I) are active orally, that they cross the<br>
15  	blood-brain barrier and that they are capable of<br>
blocking the action specific to the NK1 receptors in the central nervous system.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) were evaluated in the test of bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs, <br>
20  	according to the method described by X. Emonds-Alt<br>
et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 1993, 250,  403-413. The compounds of formula (I) administered intravenously strongly antagonize the bronchoconstriction induced by intravenous administration of <br>
25  	septide to guinea pigs under these experimental conditions.<br><br><br>
The in vivo pharmacological activity of the compounds of formula (I) was also evaluated in the model of hypotension in dogs, according to the method described by X. Emonds-Alt et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., <br>
 5  	1993, 250r   403-413. The compounds of formula (I)<br>
administered intravenously strongly inhibit the hypo<br>
tension induced by intravenous administration of . [Sar9,<br>
Met(02)u]substance P in anaesthetized dogs under these<br>
experimental conditions.<br>
10	These results show that the compounds of<br>
formula (I) block the action specific to the NK1 receptors in the peripheral nervous system.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are, in particular, active principles of pharmaceutical <br>
15  	compositions, whose toxicity is compatible with their use as medicinal products.<br>
	The compounds of formula (I) above can be used<br>
at daily doses of from 0.01 to 100 mg per kilo of body<br>
weight of the mammal to be treated, preferably at daily<br>
20  	doses of from 0.1 to 50 mg/kg. In human beings, the dose<br>
can preferably range from 0.1 to 4000 mg per day, more<br>
particularly from 0.5 to 1000 mg depending on the age of<br>
the individual to be treated or the type of treatment:<br>
prophylatic or curative.<br>
2 5		For their use as medicinal products, the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are generally administered in<br><br><br>
dosage units. The said dosage units are preferably<br>
formulated in pharmaceutical compositions in which the<br>
active principle is mixed with one or more<br>
pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
 5	Thus, according to another of its aspects, the<br>
present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing, as active principle, a compound of<br>
formula (I) or one of the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, solvates and/or hydrates thereof.<br>
10	In the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention for oral, sublingual, inhaled, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, local or rectal administration, the active principles can be administered in unit forms of administration, <br>
15  	mixed with conventional pharmaceutical supports, to<br>
animals and to human beings. The appropriate unit forms of administration comprise oral-route forms such as tablets, gel capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual and buccal adminis<br>
20  	tration forms, aerosols, topical administration forms, implants, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular administration forms and rectal administration forms.<br>
When a solid composition is prepared in the <br>
25  	form of tablets or gel capsules, a mixture of pharmaceutical excipients which can be composed of diluents<br><br><br>
such as, for example, lactose, microcrystalline cell<br>
ulose, starch, dicalcium phosphate, binders such as, for<br>
example, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethyl-<br>
cellulose, crumbling agents such as crosslinked poly-<br>
 5  	vinylpyrrolidone, crosslinked carboxymethyl- cellulose,<br>
flow agents such as silica or talc, and lubricants such<br>
as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl tri-<br>
behenate or sodium stearyl fumarate, is added to the<br>
micronized or non-micronized active principle.<br>
10		Wetting agents or surfactants such as sodium<br>
lauryl sulphate, polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188 can be added to the formulation.<br>
The tablets can be prepared by various techniques: direct tabletting, dry granulation, wet<br>
15  	granulation, hot-melt.<br>
The tablets may be naked or sugar-coated (for example with sucrose) or coated with various polymers or. other suitable materials.<br>
The tablets can have a flash, delayed or <br>
20  	sustained release by preparing polymer matrices or by using specific filming polymers.<br>
The gel capsules can be soft or hard, and coated with film or otherwise, so as to have flash, sustained  or delayed activity (for example via an <br>
25  	enteric form).<br>
They can contain not only a solid formulation<br><br>
formulated as above for the tablets, but also liquid or semi-solid formulations.<br>
A preparation in the form of a syrup or elixir can contain the active principle together with a <br>
5  	sweetener, preferably a calorie-free sweetener, methyl paraben and propyl paraben as antiseptic agent, as well as a flavouring agent and a suitable colorant.<br>
The water-dispersible powders or granules can contain the active principle as a mixture with <br>
10  	dispersants, wetting agents or suspending agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with sweeteners or flavour enhancers.<br>
For rectal administration, use is made of. suppositories which are prepared with binders that melt<br>
15  	at the rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene glycols.<br>
Aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or sterile, injectable solutions which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersants and/or solubilizing <br>
20  	agents, for example propylene glycol, are used for<br>
parenteral, intranasal or intraocular administration.<br>
Thus, in order to prepare an aqueous solution. which can be injected intravenously, a co-solvent such as, for example, an alcohol such as ethanol or a glycol<br>
25  	such as polyethylene glycol or propylene glycol, and a hydrophilic surfactant such as  polysorbate 80 or<br><br>
poloxamer 188 can be used. To prepare an injectable oily<br>
solution for intramuscular administration, the active<br>
principle can be dissolved with a triglyceride or a<br>
glycerol ester.<br>
5	Creams, ointments, gels, eye drops and sprays<br>
can be used for local administration.<br>
	Patches in multilaminar or reservoir form in<br>
which the active principle can be in alcoholic solution,<br>
and sprays can be used for transdermal administration.<br>
10.	An aerosol containing, for example, sorbitan<br>
trioleate or oleic acid as well as trichlorofluoro-methane, dichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoro-ethane, freon substitutes or any other biologically compatible propellent gas is used for administration by<br>
15  	inhalation; a system containing the active principle<br>
alone or combined with an excipient, in powder form, can also be used.<br>
The active principle can also be in the form of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example a-, p- or<br>
20  y-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin.<br>
The active principle can also be formulated in the form of microcapsules or microspheres, optionally with one or more supports or additives.<br>
Among the sustained-release forms which are <br>
25  useful in the case of chronic treatments, it is possible<br><br>
to use implants. These can be prepared in the form of an oily suspension or in the form of a suspension of microspheres in an isotonic medium.<br>
In each dosage unit, the active principle of <br>
5  	formula (I) is present in the amounts suited to the daily doses envisaged. In general, each dosage unit is appropriately adjusted according to the dosage and the type of administration envisaged, for example tablets, gel capsules and the like, sachets, ampules, syrups and<br>
10  the like, or drops, such that a dosage unit contains<br>
from 0.1 to 1000 mg of active principle, preferably from 0.5 to 250 mg, which needs to be administered 1 to 4 times a day.<br>
Although these doses are examples of average <br>
15  	situations, there may be special cases in which higher<br>
or lower doses are appropriate, and such doses also form part of the invention. According to the usual practice, the dosage which is appropriate to each patient is determined by the doctor according to the mode of <br>
20  	administration, and the age, weight and response of the said patient.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I)-, or of one of the pharmaceutically <br>
25  	acceptable salts, solvates and/or hydrates thereof-, for the preparation of medicinal products intended for<br><br><br>
