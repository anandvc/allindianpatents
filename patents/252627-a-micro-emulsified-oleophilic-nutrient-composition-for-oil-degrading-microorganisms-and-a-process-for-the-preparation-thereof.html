				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a micro emulsified oleophilic nutrient composition and the process of preparation thereof for culturing micro organisms used for combating oil pollution in water.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Sea water gets polluted by accidental spillages of oil from oil tankers, offshore drilling operations etc. The spillage of oil results in the formation of a continuous film of slick of oil which tends to spread continuously. This oil film is undesirable because it constitutes a barrier to the transfer of air and light from the atmosphere to the sea water, which are indispensable to support the marine life. In costal water, the oily film also damages the beaches.<br>
One way of dealing with such pollution is to use oil dispersing compositions containing surface active compounds. When the dispersing compositions are sprayed on the oil slicks, they disintegrate the cohesive oil film into small droplets and disperse the droplets into the water column to a depth of several meters. The droplets, that are dispersed under the sea, are then biodegraded and consumed by microorganisms that are present in sea and are active in oil metabolism. This biological degradation is a slow process and is consequently unable to prevent the settling of un-degraded oil droplets and the formation of oil deposits on the floor of the sea.<br>
The biodegradation, as mentioned above, can be enhanced by increasing the growth of the microorganisms at the water oil interface. Controlling pollution caused by hydrocarbon compounds (oil) in water by bioremediation is acquiring increasing significance. The. principle of bioremediation is based on optimum promotion of the growth of the pollution consuming microorganisms population. Major advantage of this process is the inexpensive in situ process without producing any waste for further disposal.In this regard two important features are of paramount significance(i) presence of oil degrading microorganisms at the oil-water interface, and (ii) nutrients required for the growth of the oil degrading microorganisms. In the elimination of hydrocarbon slicks by biodegradation at sea, beaches or even in lakes, the biggest problem is the preliminary multiplication of the oil degrading microorganisms. As such, it becomes necessary to supply growth promoting elements of the microorganisms. Generally, these growth promoting elements are not present in sufficient concentration in the polluted area.<br>
These growth promoting elements are primarily inorganic or organic compounds of nitrogen and phosphorous and these are generally not available in sufficient concentration in the polluted area. These growth promoting elements are made available as nutrient concentrate for stimulation as well as growth aids for the accelerated growth of the microorganisms. The nutrient concentrate is made in the form of a micro emulsion, which is thermodynamically stable water in oil type. The internal phase of micro emulsion is aqueous solution of nutrient material and the external phase is a liquid immiscible with water. This helps nutrient substance to remain in the layer treated instead of being entrained by water.<br>
Mineral salts such as ammonium salts, phosphates etc. are commonly used as nutrients. However, these mineral salts are soluble in water and these have practically no affinity for the polluting oil where a strong growth of microorganism should occur. Further, nitrogen containing organic nutrients such as condensation products of urea or melamine with aldehydes is soluble in water. These readily go to aqueous phase when sprayed on oil slick.<br>
To eliminate this problem, various methods have been tried. The,US Patent No. 1959127 discloses a method, wherein a nutrient in the form of granules of nitrogenous compounds and solid phosphates coated with paraffin is made for the growth of the microorganisms.<br>
However, this method suffers from the disadvantage that it requires special equipment which increases the cost of the nutrient.<br>
Another disadvantage of this method, known in the art, is that it requires a separate surface-active agent for the treatment of the oil slicks.<br>
Still another disadvantage of this method, known in the prior art, is that the paraffin coating may get dissolved if the polluting oil contains aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
US Patent No. 3883397 discloses a method wherein coating of fatty add salt instead of paraffin is made. However, this method suffers from the disadvantage that fatty acid coating material is difficult to degrade in the absence of external nitrogen and phosphorous, thereby making it difficult for the microorganisms to have the nutrient readily available.<br>
The disadvantages of the prior art, mentioned above, have been overcome by the oleophilic nutrient of the present invention for the growth of the microorganisms active in oil degradation and which are present in sea water. The nutrient of the present invention is in the form of a micro emulsion of water in oil type, the internal phase of which is an aqueous solution of nutrient material and the external phase is a liquid immiscible with water but miscible with the hydrophobic liquid to be biodegraded. The use of the nutrient helps in achieving rapid and complete biodegradation of the oil at low cost. The nutrient exhibits a low toxicity towards aquatic flora.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a micro emulsifide oleiophilic nutrient composition for the growth of oil degrading microorganisms to combat oil pollution in water and in shore.<br>

Still further object of the invention is to provide a micro emulsified oleiphilic nutrient composition, which helps in the growth of oil degrading bacteria.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a micro emulsified oleiophilic nutrient composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which helps in accelerated growth of oil degrading microorganisms to combat oil pollution in sea water. The nutrient of the present invention is in the form of a micro emulsion of water in oil type, the internal phase of which is an aqueous solution of nutrient material and the external phase is a liquid immiscible with water but miscible with the hydrophobic liquid to be biodegraded. The use of the nutrient helps in achieving rapid and complete biodegradation of the oil at low cost. The nutrient exhibits a low toxicity towards aquatic flora. Further, it has a higher shelf life of one year and it is thermally stable over a temperature range of 20°C to 85°C.<br>
The process of the present invention involves in the micro emulsification of the nutrient with the help of micro emulsifying agents and optimizing the conditions for the preparation. The external phase of the micro emulsion is miscible with the hydrophobic liquid to be biodegraded. The nutrient composition of the present invention utilizes a unsaturated long chain fatty acid oleic acid as a source of carbon which is utilized by the oil degrading microorganisms and which is miscible with the external hydrophobic layer. This permits rapid development of the oil degrading microorganisms. Urea, which is a rich source of nitrogen and which is very much soluble in water is utilized as a source of nitrogen by the nutrient composition. The nutrient also utilizes lauryl ethoxy phosphate as a surfactant and as a source of phosphorous. Further, it utilizes 2-butoxy ethanol as the co-surfactant which helps in reducing the viscosity of the microemulsion. The nutrient composition also utilizes 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol which bind water at the interface and which helps in slow release of the nutrient. It also helps in maintaining the pH of the emulsion and works as a micro emulsifier. Slow release of the nutrient is required so that the nutrient is available to the oil degrading microorganisms for a longer duration.<br>
