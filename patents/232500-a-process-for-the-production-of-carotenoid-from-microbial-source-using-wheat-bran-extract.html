				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the production of carotenoid from microbial source.<br>
Carotenoids are required as feed supplements in the poultry industry and in aquaculture of fishes and crustaceans. Besides, providing nutrition and possibly disease resistance, carotenoids give brilliant pigmentation and aesthetic value to Crustacea, animals, etc.<br>
Recent studies have suggested that carotenoids have health benefits in humans and animals by preventing or delaying some chronic diseases including cancer, arteriosclerosis and cataract. These findings have contributed greatly to the industrial and medical interests in carotenoids.<br>
Most of the carotenoids used in the food, feed, nutritional supplement, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries or for other industrial purposes are produced by total chemical synthesis. Production of natural food colours is gaining importance throughout the world, due to increase in public awareness and also due to the growing consumer demand for safe, natural food colourants. Because of technological limitations of synthetic colourants, there is a growing interest in the development and application of colourants from microbial sources. Certainly, a primary contributing factor to the increased interest in natural carotenoids is the current trend of avoiding food additives and synthetic chemicals in foods.<br>
Microbial carotenoids have attracted much interest in recent years for several reasons, the primary reason is the growth of aquaculture - currently the fastest growing sector of agriculture. Astaxanthin is an important source of pigmentation, p-carotene, on the other hand, is an important food colourant as well as the source of vitamin-A in animal diets. The market for these two carotenoids is rapidly growing and only microbial synthesis can meet the demand for biological carotenoids.<br>
The rapid growth of microbes reduces the production time to a matter of days and the process lends itself to a continuous operation.<br>
Carotenoid pigment biosynthesis is a characteristic ability of genus Rhodotorula. It produces a mixture of carotenoids such as P-carotene, torulene and torularhodine. The P-carotene found in this yeast has attracted commercial interest as a precursor of vitamin-A and as a yellow pigment for food.<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Frengova et al. (1994) wherein whey filtrate was used as a substrate for formation of carotenoids by R.gracilis with co-cultivation of homo-fermentative lactic acid bacteria. The draw back in this method is a synthetic medium consisting of high concentration of glucose, yeast extract, phosphate and magnesium sulphate as growth medium which is expensive and also separation of carotenoids from a mixed culture is not suitable.<br>
Reference may be made to Martin et al. (1993) wherein acid extracts of peat was used as the main substrate source for carotenoids production by Rhodotorula rubra. The draw back of this method is the supplementation of nutrients such as (NH4)2S04, yeast extract, K2SO4 and MgSO4.7H2O. Carotenoid concentration reported is 1,256 ug/g dry mass. Peat is not a commonly available substrate for use.<br>
Reference may be made to Buzzini and Martini (1999) wherein grape must, glucose syrup, beet molasses, soyabean flour extract maize flour extract, etc were used individually as carbon substrate for carotenoid production. In these media, other nutrients such as glucose, KH2P04, MgS04.7H2O, yeast extract were also used. The total carotenoid reported with (a) concentrated grape must is 915.4 µg/g dry cells, (b) grape must 455.4 µg/g, (c) glucose syrup 240 µg/g, (d) beet (e) molasses 332.8 µg/g, (e) soyabean flour extract 883.3µg/g and with maize flour extract 383.9 µg/g dry cells only.<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Costa et al. (1987), wherein a chemical defined medium consisting of sucrose, (NH4)2SO4, KH2PO4, Na2HPO4, MgSO4.7H2O yeast extract, with pH 6.5 was used and 605 ug/g of dry cells of P-carotene is obtained when cells are maintained under non-proliferating conditions. This process involves an additional step of harvesting, washing and second stage of fermentation.<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Shih and Hang (1996), wherein sauerkraut brine is used as a substrate for production of carotenoids and the maximum yield of total carotenoids expressed as P-carotene was only 16.35 ug/g yeast on dry weight basis.<br>
The technical know how of using wheat bran extract for carotenoid production under submerged fermentation is not established so far.<br>
The main object of the present invention is a process for the production of carotenoid from microbial<br>
source.<br>
Accordingly, present invention provides a process for the production of carotenoids from microbial source<br>
using wheat bran extract, which comprises:<br>
a)	soaking, extracting followed by filtering of the wheat bran with water, at 20 - 97°C temperature,<br>
b)	enriching of the above filtrate with carbon source such as herein described at 1.5 to 4.0% level and<br>
pH of 4.5 to 6.Om<br>
c)	sterilizing the enriched extract at 115 - 125°C for 15 to 25 minutes followed by cooling to 27 to<br>
32°C,<br>
d)	inoculating the above sterilized extract with 8 to 12% yeast cell suspension such as defined herein ,<br>
e)	fermenting aerobically for 36 to 168 hr in a state of rotary motion at 25 - 32°C,<br>
f)	harvesting the above cell biomass from fermented broth for extraction of carotenoid by using an<br>
organic solvents.<br>
In embodiment of the present invention extraction may be carried out with water at 20 to 97°C<br>
temperature.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the carbon source used for enrichment may be glucose<br>
at 1.5 to 4% maximum at pH 4.5 to 6.0.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the sterilization may be carried out at 120 - 122°C for 20 to 22<br>
minutes.<br>
In an another embodiment, the yeast cell suspension may contain Rhodotorula gracilis at 8 - 12 %<br>
concentration.<br>
Rhodotorula gracilus (ATCC 90950) produces a mixture of carotenoids such as torulene, torulahodine<br>
and beta-carotene which find its application as food colourant in cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals and also in<br>
poultry feed.   The yeast in use produces more of beta-carotene.   In addition, the yeast also produces<br>
lipids which may add value to the product.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the cell suspension of Rhodotorula gracilis may be 20 to<br>
24 hr old culture.<br>
In an another embodiment, the broth may be fermented aerobically for a period of 36 - 168 hr.<br>
In an another embodiment of the invention, the solvents used for extraction may be from acetone, hexane and diethyl ether.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the yield of total carotenoid may be 1100 to 1300 µg/g dry cell mass.<br>
The detailed process for the production of carotenoid is presented below along with the flow diagram.<br>
The detail process for production of carotenoid is as follows: R.gracilis CFR1 was maintained on PDA agar (slants) consisting per litre glucose 20.Og, potato infusion from 200g of potato, agar 20.0g at 4°C.<br>
Preparation of wheat bran extract medium<br>
l.Og of wheat bran was taken in a beaker, suspended in 50 ml of distilled water, left at ambient temperature for a period of one hour. After one hour of soaking, the wheat bran extract was filtered through a muslin cloth and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected in a conical flask. The residue was washed 3 times with water. The supernatant are pooled together and the residue discarded.<br>
To the filtrate 2 g of glucose was added. The volume was made up to 85 ml. pH was adjusted to 5.5 with 0.1N NaOH/O.lN HC1.  The final volume was made upto 92 ml. The medium was sterilised at 121°C for 20 min, cooled and used as medium for production of carotenoids. Preparation of inoculum<br>
1% Enebose medium was used as growth medium for inoculum preparation. The following ingredients glucose 1 g, CaCl2.2H2O (0.04g), MgSO4.7H2O (0.04g), yeast extract (0.15 g), NH4N03 (0.0286 g), KH2PO4 (0.075 g) were weighed in a beaker, dissolved completely in 95 ml of water. pH was adjusted to 5.5 with 0.1N NaOH/O.lN HC1. The final volume was made up to 100 ml. This medium was taken in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, sterilised at 121°C for 20 min, cooled to room temperature. A loop of 3 days old culture of R.gracilis from PDA slants was transferred into Enebose medium with 1% glucose, incubated on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at ambient temperature (28+2°C) for 20 hr. At the end of 20 hr, 10 ml of this cell suspension (fermented broth) was used for inoculation of wheat bran medium for carotenoid production.<br><br>
Cultivation of yeast cells for carotenoid production<br>
10 ml of 20 hr old cell culture of R.gracilis (107/ml) was inoculated into wheat bran medium (90 ml). This was incubated on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at ambient temperature 28+2°C for 120 hours. Harvesting<br>
At the end of fermentation, yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm) for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded. The cells were washed twice with distilled water to remove excessive nutrients. This biomass was used for extraction of carotenoids.<br>
Extraction of carotenoids was carried out as follows: 1.0 g of wet cells are taken in a pestle and mortar. Two spatula (10 g) full of acid and alkali washed sand (neutral sand) was added to the cells. 20 ml of acetone was added to the mixture and ground with the pestle. Then 15 ml of hexane is added and the extract is collected in a cylinder. Another 20 ml of acetone was added to the cells, ground to fine mass, 15 ml of hexane is added, and the extract is decanted into the cylinder. The cells are further extracted with 30 ml of diethyl ether. The cells are repeatedly extracted with diethyl ether till the cells become colourless. All the solvent extracts are pooled together passed through a bed of anhydrous sodium sulphate. This clear carotenoid extract was flash evaporated at 35°C with 120 rpm under 200 Ib vacuum to dryness. The extract is taken in 10 ml of chloroform for estimation. Estimation of carotenoids<br>
The carotenoid content were estimated by absorption spectrum of the carotenoid solution at 460 nm. A molar extinction coefficient value of 99330 cm/l/mol obtained from an average value of E from ten carotenoids (lycopene, alpha-carotene, ß-carotene, δ-carotene, zeaxanthin, rhodoxanthin, astaxanthin, lutein, ß-apo-2 carotenal and dihydro ß-carotene) was used in the following equation for determining the percentage of carotenoid present in the sample.<br>
Percentage of carotenoids = 5.405 x 10-4 x (A460 X/Y), where A460 is the absorbance of X ml of solution obtained from Y g of dry cells. The dry weight of the cells employed was determined from the estimated moisture content of the wet cells.<br><br>
Ultraviolet visible spectroscopic measurements were carried out using a UV-160 recording Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).<br>
In the above process, other nutrients such as yeast extract, MgSO4. 7H2O, KH2PO4, NH4NO3 and CaCl2.H2O are eliminated. All these are replaced by just the water extract of wheat bran which was later enriched with glucose for the growth of the yeast for carotenoid production.<br>
