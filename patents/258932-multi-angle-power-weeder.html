				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an agricultural based power operated walking type compact mechanical inter cultivator operated by a single person suitable for 80 cm spaced row crop weeding work. PROBLEMS IN THE PRIOR ART Today, weeding work in agriculture is a key problem faced by agriculturists on account of the shortage of agricultural labour and monsoon associated higher weed problems. This problem can be overcome/obviate by the present invention. The present invention will help the farmers in achieving more economy in their cultivation activities by reducing the cost of weeding and maximizing the productivity of the crops.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention comprises a articulated drive which comprises a rotary cultivating tool which is mounted on a small vehicle by means of an arm which is adjustable and retractable relative to the vehicle so that the cultivating tool can move between the plants while the vehicle moves in a crop row.<br>
The main advantage of the articulated drive in the present invention is that the cutting unit alone can be moved closer to the stem of the grown plants to remove the weeds so that the branches of the grown plants which spread like umbrella will not be affected in the weeding activity. The cutting blades in the weeding machine can be positioned upwards to remove weeds without affecting ridges in the case of ridge top planted crops. Similarly, the cutting blades can be positioned downwards to remove weeds without affecting the plants in the case of furrow planted crops. The machinery has been designed in such a way that the said weeding activities can be carried out both in the left and right hand side of the vehicle by changing the position of the cutting unit.<br>
The power weeder operates with a variable speed gear box which could be adjusted for different speed conditions as per requirement. The advantage of the variable speed -gear box is that the moving speed of the vehicle -can be controlled based on the weed conditions (Like grown weeds, young weeds, wet moisture weeds, dry moisture weeds and dry run etc)<br>
The weeding machine has been designed in such a way that the whole unit can be turned easily in any directions. The cutting shaft of the machine can be adjusted in a circular motion using two pairs of adjustment holed flanges and lock bolts and in a up and down movement with the help of single lock bolt so that the weeding machine can be used for other cultivation works such as adding soil to the roots of grown plants, cleaning the weeds adjacent to young plants, forming ridges in between two rows of the plants and cleaning water flowing sub canals within the field apart from normal weeding work. . As the above specific drive device has swinging rotation and linear movements comprising an articulated drive, the new power weeder is thus named as multi angle power weeder. The rotational direction of the cutting shaft can be manually changed by altering the position of the bevel gear in the P.T.O chamber according to requirements. The sharp L-shaped blades attached with the cutting shaft will help in cutting weeds in to small pieces and turn them in to a fine green manure. The entire weeding unit can be adjusted to operate at the desired depth level by the depth control system. The main advantages of the depth control system are: Generally, the cultivated lands are not even and which will have ridges and furrows.<br>
As the depth control mechanism in the already available weeding machines is positioned behind the cutting shaft, it destroy the ridges and furrows of the cultivated land completely and thereby creates the problem of reworking of ridges and furrows in the weeded land. The present invention saves the existing ridges and furrows in the weeding land and overcomes this problem by designing the cutting shaft parallel to the depth control system and thereby helps in saving cost, time and efforts in the weeding activity<br>
The multi purpose and multi angle power weeder is operated with the help of 5 HP diesel engine. The weeding machine is used in the cultivation of sugarcane, banana, cotton, chilly, vegetable crops, floriculture etc. The use of the weeder machine saves lot of time, labour and cost and ensures neat and clean weeding operation. It is successful machinery suitable for any type of land.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is described in detail with the help of the drawings of weeding machinery shown in different view points.<br>
FIG-1 Shows side elevation of the power weeder with the removal of right side moving wheel along with reference numerals of its different parts which is quoted in their description.<br>
FIG-2 Shows top plan view of the right side cutting and left side cutting operation of the cutting blades.<br>
FIG-3 Shows front view of the up and down left side cutting operation of the cutting blades.<br>
FIG-4 Shows front view of the up and down right side cutting operation of the cutting blades.<br>
The multi purpose power weeder machinery shown in the fingers 1 to 4 is powered by 5 HP diesel engine (1) which is fixed on the chassis (2). The chassis is fixed on the housing (3). Two traction button tire wheels (4) are mounted on either side of the housing. The variable speed gear box (5) and clutch pulley (6) are mounted in the front side of the engine (1). The power is transmitted from the engine (1) to the cutting shaft (7) and moving wheels (4) by clutch pulley (6) through V-belt (8) and gear box (5), output shaft (9) pinion housing (10), chain (11) and chain sprocket (12). There is a perpendicular tube (13a) and a horizontal chamber (18), which are made up of cast iron comprises respectively two vertical chambers (27) and one horizontal chamber known as cutting shaft chamber (18). Each chamber houses input shaft (14), output shaft (9) and a pairs of bevel gears (15). The transmission chambers are locked with two of flanges (16) and lock nuts (17) which will allow for the rotation of the chambers according to requirements.<br>
The cutting shaft chamber (18) is fitted 150 cm above the ground and it is fitted with oil seal (19) and 0-ring (20) to maintain oil level through out the cutting shaft (7) operating inside the cutting shaft chamber (18). The cutting shaft chamber (18) can be rotated both in the right and left direction by manually changing the bevel gear (15) in PTO chamber (28). The rotation can be achieved from 0° to 120°. The bevel gear assembly inspection holes (29) are ftilly enclosed with outer covers. To control the whole apparatus, a handle bar (21) is fixed behind the engine (1). The speed control knob (22) is fixed in the right side of the handle bar (21) and the clutch lever (23) is fixed in the left side of the handle bar (21). The variable speed control lever (24) is mounted on the left side of handle bar (21). The depth control system (25) which looks like a trolley wheel is fitted in vertical position either in the left and right side of the cutting shaft chamber . It can be adjusted to control the depth level of <br>
the cutting shaft with the help of screw type mechanism. L-shaped cutting blades (26) are rigidly mounted on the cutting shaft. To reduce the height and breathe of the apparatus, the engine pulley (30), V-belt (8) and clutch pulley (6) are designed to operate in a vertical position.<br>
