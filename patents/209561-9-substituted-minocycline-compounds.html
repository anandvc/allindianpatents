Background of the Invention<br>
The development of the tetracycline antibiotics was the direct result of a systematic screening of soil specimens collected from many parts of the world for evidence of microorganisms capable of producing bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions. The first of these novel compounds was introduced in 1948 under the name chlortetracycline. Two years later, oxytetracycline became available. The elucidation of the chemical structure of these compounds confirmed their similarity and fiimished the analytical basis for the production of a third member of this group in 1952, tetracycline. A new family of tetracycline compounds, without the ring-attached methyl group present in earlier tetracyclines, was prepared in 1957 and became publicly available in 1967; and minocycline was in use by 1972.<br>
Recently, research efforts have focused on developing new tetracycline antibiotic compositions effective under varying therapeutic conditions and routes of administration. New tetracycline analogues have also been investigated which may prove to be equal to or more effective than the originally introduced tetracycline compounds. Examples include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,980,584; 2,990,331; 3,062,717; 3,165,531; 3,454,697; 3,557,280; 3,674,859; 3,957,980; 4,018,889; 4,024,272; and 4,126,680. These patents are representative of the range of pharmaceutically active tetracycline and tetracycline analogue compositions.<br>
Historically, soon after their initial development and introduction, the tetracyclines were found to be highly effective pharmacologically against rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, and psittacosis. Hence, tetracyclines became known as "broad spectrum" antibiotics. With the subsequent establishment of their in vitro antimicrobial activity, effectiveness in experimental infections, and pharmacological properties, the tetracyclines as a class rapidly became widely used for therapeutic purposes. However, this widespread use of tetracyclines for both major and minor illnesses and diseases led directiy to<br><br>
the emergence of resistance to these antibiotics even among highly susceptible bacterial species both commensal and pathogenic (e.g., pneumococci and Salmonella). The rise of tetracycline-resistant organisms has resulted in a general decline in use of tetracyclines and tetracycline analogue compositions as antibiotics of choice.<br>

SCHEME 1<br>
Generally, 9-substituted minocycline compounds can be synthesized as shown in Scheme 2 by treating minocycline (1 A), with sulfuric acid and sodium nitrate. The resulting product is 9-nitro (IB) minocycline. The nitro minocycline compound is then treated with hydrogen gas and a platinum catalyst to yield the 9-amino minocycline compound, IC. To synthesize 9 derivatives, the 9-amino minocycline compound is treated with HONO, to yield the diazonium salt (ID). The salt can subsequently be treated with numerous compounds<br><br><br>
SCHEME 2<br>
As shown in Scheme 3, minocycline compounds of the invention wherein R^ is a carbamate or a urea derivative can be synthesized using the following protocol. Minocycline (2A) is treated with NaN02 under acidic conditions forming 9-nitro minocycline (2B). 9-nitrominocycline (2B) is then treated with H2 gas and a platinum catalyst to form the 9-amino minocycline derivative (2C). To form the urea derivative (2E), isocyanate (2D) is reacted with the 9-amino minocycline derivative (2C). To form the carbamate (2G), the appropriate acid chloride ester (2F) is reacted with 2C.<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 3, minocycline compounds of the invention, wherein R^ is a heterocyclic (i.e. thiazole) substituted amino group can be synthesized using the above protocol. 9-amino minocyline (3A) is reacted with Fmoc-isothiocyanate (3B) to produce the protected thiourea (3C). The protected thiourea (3C) is then deprotected yielding the active tetracycline urea or tetracycline thiourea (3D) compound. The tetracycline thiourea (3D) is reacted with an a-haloketone (3E) to produce a thiazole substituted 9-amino minocycline (3F).<br><br>
SCHEME 4<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, 9- alkenyl minocycline compounds (4A) can be hydrogenated to form alkyl 9- substituted minocycline compounds (4B). Scheme 4 depicts the selective hydrogenation of the 9- position double bond, with hydrogen gas and a palladium/carbon catalyst. Similarly, 9-alkynyl minocyclines also can be hydrogenated to form 9-alkyl<br><br>
In Scheme 5, a general synthetic scheme for synthesizing 9-position aryl derivatives of a minocycline compound is shown. In Scheme 5, a Suzuki coupling of an aryl boronic acid with an iodominocycline compound is shovm. An iodo minocycline compound (5B) can be synthesized from sancycline by treating minocycline (5 A) with at least one equivalent N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) under acidic conditions. The reaction is quenched, and the resulting 9-<br><br>
1	i<br>
iodo minocycline (5B) can then be purified using standard techniques known in the art. To form the aryl derivative, 9-iodo minocycline (5B) is treated with boronic acid (5C) plus aqueous sodium carbonate, and is catalyzed with palladium. The product (5D) can be purified by methods known in the art (such as HPLC). Other 9-aryl minocycline compounds can be synthesized using similar protocols.<br>
The 9-substituted minocycline compounds of the invention can also be synthesized using Stille cross couplings. Stille cross couplings can be performed using an appropriate tin reagent (e.g., R-SnBua) and a halogenated tetracycline compound, (e.g., 9-iodominocycline). The tin reagent and the iodominocycline compound can be treated with a palladium catalyst (e.g., Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 or Pd(AsPh3)2Cl2) and, optionally, with an additional copper saU, e.g., Cul.<br><br>
SCHEME 6<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be synthesized using Heck-type cross coupling reactions. As shown in Scheme 6, Heck-type cross-couplings can be performed using a halogenated tetracycline compound (e.g., 9-iodominocycline, 6A), a reactive alkene (6B) or alkyne (6D), and an appropriate palladium or other transition metal catalyst. The resulting 9-substituted alkenyl (6C) or 9-substituted alkynyl (6E) minocycline compound can then be purified using techniques known in the art.<br>

Aryl groups can also be fused or bridged with alicyclic or heterocyclic rings which are not aromatic so as to form a polycycle (e.g., tetralin).<br><br>
The term "alkenyl" includes unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous in length and Dossible substitution to the alkyls described above, but that contain at least one double bond.<br>
For example, the term "alkenyl" includes straight-chain alkenyl groups (e.g., ethylenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl, nonenyl, decenyl, etc.), branched-chain alkenyl groups, cycloalkenyl (alicyclic) groups (cyclopropenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl, cyclooctenyl), alkyl or alkenyl substituted cycloalkenyl groups, and cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl substituted alkenyl groups. The term alkenyl further includes alkenyl groups which include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfijr or phosphorous atoms replacing one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkenyl group has 6 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone {e.g., C2-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain). Likewise, cycloalkenyl groups may have from 3-8 carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have 5 or 6 carbons in the ring structure.

The language "tetracycline compound responsive state" includes states which can be treated, prevented, or otherwise ameliorated by the administration of a minocycline compound of the invention. Tetracycline compound responsive states include bacterial infections (including those which are resistant to other tetracycline compounds), cancer, diabetes, and other states for which tetracycline compounds have been found to be active (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,789,395; 5,834,450; and 5,532,227). Compounds of the invention can be used to prevent or control important manmialian and veterinary diseases such as diarrhea, urinary tract infections, infections of skin and skin structure, ear, nose and throat infections, wound infection, mastitis and the like. In addition, methods for treating neoplasms using tetracycline compounds of the invention are also included (van der Bozert et al.. Cancer Res.,<br><br>
48:6686-6690 (1988)). For certain tetracycline responsive state, a minocycline compound of the invention with little or no antibacterial activity may be desirable.<br>
Bacterial infections may be caused by a wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The compounds of the invention are useful as antibiotics against organisms which are resistant to other tetracycline compounds. The antibiotic activity of the tetracycline compounds of the invention may be determined using the method discussed in Example 2, or by using the in vitro standard broth dilution method described in Waitz, J.A., National Commission for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Document M7-A2, vol. 10, no. 8, pp. 13-20, 2"^ edition, Villanova, PA (1990).<br>
The minocycline compounds may also be used to treat infections traditionally treated with tetracycline compounds such as, for example, rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, psittacosis. The tetracycline compounds may be used to treat infections of, e.g., K. pneumoniae, Salmonella, E. hirae, A. baumanii, B, catarrhalis, K influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. faecium, E. coli, S. aureus or E, faecalis. In one embodiment, the minocycline compound is used to treat a bacterial infection that is resistant to other tetracycline antibiotic compounds. The minocycline compound of the invention may be administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "effective amount" of the compound is that amount necessary or sufficient to treat or prevent a tetracycline compound responsive state. The effective amount can vary depending on such factors as the size and weight of the subject, the type of illness, or the particular minocycline compound. For example, the choice of the minocycline compound can affect what constitutes an "effective amount". One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to study the aforementioned factors and make the determination regarding the effective amount of the minocycline compound without undue experimentation.<br>
The invention also pertains to methods of treatment against microorganism infections and associated diseases. The methods include administration of an effective amount of one or more minocycline compoimds to a subject. The subject can be either a plant or, advantageously, an animal, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human.<br>
In the therapeutic methods of the invention, one or more minocycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone to a subject, or more typically a compound of the invention will be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition in mixture with conventional excipient, i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, oral or other desired administration and which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds and are not deleterious to the recipient thereof<br><br>
The invention also pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a minocycline compound and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The language "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes substances capable of being coadministered with the minocycline compound(s), and which allow both to perform their intended function, e.g., treat or prevent a tetracycline responsive state. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds of the invention.<br>
The minocycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the minocycline compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and palmoate [i.e., l,r-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to a subject, e.g., a mammal, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a minocycline compound of the invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid sah is readily obtained. The preparation of other minocycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
The preparation of other minocycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The minocycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of base salts. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of those minocycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such pharmaceutically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations {e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower alkanoiammonium and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines. The pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of minocycline compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature may be formed with pharmaceutically acceptable cations by conventional methods. Thus, these salts may be readily prepared by treating the minocycline compound of the invention with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutically acceptable cation and evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, a lower alkyl alcohol solution of the minocycline compound of the invention may be mixed with an alkoxide of the desired metal and the solution subsequently evaporated to dryness.<br>
The preparation of other minocycline compounds of the invention not specifically described in the foregoing experimental section can be accomplished using combinations of the reactions described above that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The minocycline compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered via either the oral, parenteral or topical routes. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in effective dosages, depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. Variations may occur depending upon the species of the subject being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other known compositions for treating tetracycline responsive states in a subject, e.g., a mammal. Preferred mammals include pets {e.g., cats, dogs, ferrets, etc.), farm animals (cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, etc.), lab animals (rats, mice, monkeys, etc.), and primates (chimpanzees, humans, gorillas). The language "in combination vdth" a known composition is intended to include simultaneous administration of the composition of the invention and the knovm composition, administration of the composition of the invention first,<br><br>
I<br>
followed by the known composition and administration of the known composition first, followed by the composition of the invention. Any of the therapeutically composition known in the art for treating tetracycline responsive states can be used in the methods of the invention.<br>
The minocycline compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by any of the routes previously mentioned, and the administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. For example, the novel therapeutic agents of this invention can be administered advantageously in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the therapeutically-effective compounds of this invention are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br>
For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably com, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
For parenteral administration (including intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intradermal or intramuscular injection), solutions of a therapeutic compound of the present invention in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For parenteral application, examples of suitable preparations include solutions,<br><br>
preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. Therapeutic compounds may be formulated in sterile form in multiple or single dose formats such as being dispersed in a fluid carrier such as sterile physiological saline or 5% saline dextrose solutions commonly used with injectables.<br>
Additionally, it is also possible to administer the compounds of the present invention topically when treating inflammatory conditions of the skin. Examples of methods of topical administration include transdermal, buccal or sublingual application. For topical applications, therapeutic compounds can be suitably admixed in a pharmacologically inert topical carrier such as a gel, an ointment, a lotion or a cream. Such topical carriers include water, glycerol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters, or mineral oils. Other possible topical carriers are liquid petrolatum, isopropylpalmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol 95%, polyoxyethylene monolauriate 5% in water, sodium lauryl sulfate 5% in water, and the like. In addition, materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers and the like also may be added if desired.<br>
For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees or capsules having talc and/or carbohydrate carrier binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and/or com starch and/or potato starch. A syrup, elixir or the like can be used wherein a sweetened vehicle is employed. Sustained release compositions can be formulated including those wherein the active component is protected with differentially degradable coatings, e.g., by microencapsulation, multiple coatings, etc.<br>
In addition to treatment of human subjects, the therapeutic methods of the invention also will have significant veterinary applications, e.g. for treatment of livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, cows, swine and the like; poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys and the like; horses; and pets such as dogs and cats. Also, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat non-animal subjects, such as plants.<br>
It will be appreciated that the actual preferred amounts of active compounds used in a given therapy will vary according to the specific compound being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, the particular site of administration, etc. Optimal administration rates for a given protocol of administration can be readily ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage determination tests conducted with regard to the foregoing guidelines.<br>
In general, compounds of the invention for treatment can be administered to a subject in dosages used in prior minocycline therapies. See, for example, the Physicians' Desk Reference. For example, a suitable effective dose of one or more compounds of the invention will be in the range of from 0.01 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of recipient per day, preferably in the range of from 0.1 to 50 milligrams per kilogram body weight of recipient per day, more preferably in the range of 1 to 20 milligrams per kilogram body weight of recipient<br><br>
per day. The desired dose is suitably administered once daily, or several sub-doses, e.g. 2 to 5 sub-doses, are administered at appropriate intervals through the day, or other appropriate schedule.<br>
It will also be understood that normal, conventionally known precautions will be taken regarding the administration of minocyclines generally to ensure their efficacy under normal use circumstances. Especially when employed for therapeutic treatment of humans and animals in vivo, the practitioner should take all sensible precautions to avoid conventionally known contradictions and toxic effects. Thus, the conventionally recognized adverse reactions of gastrointestinal distress and inflammations, the renal toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, changes in blood, and impairment of absorption through aluminum, calcium, and magnesium ions should be duly considered in the conventional manner.<br>
In one embodiment, the minocycline compounds of the invention do not include those described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/823,884, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also pertains to the use of a minocycline compound of formula I or II, for the preparation of a medicament. The medicament may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and the minocycline compound is an effective amount, e.g,, an effective amount to treat a tetracycline responsive state.<br>

The reaction was suctioned filtered through a pad of diatomaceous earth and washed the pad with DMF. The filtrates were reduced to an oil under vacuum and residue treated with t-butylmethyl ether. Crude material was purified via reverse phase HPLC on DVB utilizing a gradient of water and methanol/acetonitrile containing 1.0% trifluoroacetic acid. Product confirmed by mass spectrum: found M+1 578.58; the structure corroborated with IHNMR.<br>
Example 2: In vitro Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay<br>
The following assay is used to determine the efficacy of minocycline compounds against common bacteria. 2 mg of each compound is dissolved in 100 \i\ of DMSO. The solution is then added to cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB), which results in a final compound concentration of 200 jig per ml. The minocycline compound solutions are<br><br>
diluted to 50 (xL volumes, with a test compound concentration of .098 )ag/ml. Optical density (OD) determinations are made from fresh log-phase broth cultures of the test strains. Dilutions are made to achieve a final cell density of 1x10^ CFU/ml. At 0D=1, cell densities for different genera should be approximately:<br>
E.coli	1x10^ CFU/ml<br>
S. aureus	5x10^ CFU/ml<br>
Enterococcus sp,        2.5x10^ CFU/ml<br>
50 \x\ of the cell suspensions are added to each well of microtiter plates. The final cell density should be approximately 5x10^ CFU/ml. These plates are incubated at 35°C in an ambient air incubator for approximately 18 hr. The plates are read with a microplate reader and are visually inspected when necessary. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of the minocycline compound that inhibits growth. Compounds of the invention indicate good inhibition of growth.<br>
In Table 1, compounds which were good inhibitors of growth of a particular bacteria are indicated with *, compounds which were very good inhibitors of a particular bacteria are indicated with **, and compounds with were particularly good inhibitors of a particular bacteria are indicated with ***.<br>
