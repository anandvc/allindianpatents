				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to desalination systems, in particular reverse osmosis<br>
(RO) desalination systems, including a plurality of pressure vessels, desalination<br>
membranes used therein, equipment for mounting said membranes and means for<br>
estimating their operational conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
RO desalination systems are well known in the art. With reference to Fig. 1, an<br>
example of an RO desalination system is shown:<br>
The RO desalination system of the kind described above generally designated at<br>
1 comprises a plurality of pressure vessels (PVs) 2 held by a support construction 3, the<br>
construction 3 comprising holders 4 for supporting each of the PVs 2 in a horizontal<br>
orientation. Each of the PVs is in fact suspended by the support construction 3 so that it<br>
is supported from underneath at several points along its length.<br>
Each PV 2 has front and rear ends and has a centrally disposed permeate tube<br>
connected to a front product line 5 at the front end of the PV and to a rear product line<br>
(not seen) at the rear end of the PV. Each PV 2 is further connected at its front end to a<br>
feed line 6 for supplying to the PC raw fluid to be desalinated, and at its rear end to a<br>
brine (brine) line (not seen).<br>
Each of the PVs 2 has a plurality of RO membranes 10 mounted therein, whose<br>
typical design is shown in Fig. 2. As seen in Fig. 2, the membrane 10 comprises a<br>
perforated permeate tube 12 with a multi-layer membrane sheet 14 wound thereon<br>
constituting a membrane core, and an encapsulating outer shell 18.<br>
The wound multi-layer membrane sheet 14 defines a reject side on one surface<br>
thereof, coming in contact with the feed water, and a permeate side, on the opposite<br>
surface thereof, coming in contact with feed water which has passed through the sheet<br>
by reverse osmosis, i.e. permeate. The permeate tube 12 is formed with holes 13<br>
adapted for collecting said permeate, which is adapted for withdrawal from the PV via<br>
its front and rear central ports 12a and 12b constituted respectively, by front and rear<br>
ends of the permeate tube 12 of the membrane 10.<br>
The multi-layer membrane sheet 14 comprises two membrane layers 14a, a<br>
permeate layer 14b positioned therebetween, and a feed spacer 16. The multi-layer<br>
membrane sheet 14 is wound on the permeate tube 12, its front end 12a being adapted<br>
for fluid communication with the feed line 6, constituting thereby a circumferential,<br>
feed inlet port 17a of the PV for conducting raw fluid to be desalinated thereto, and its<br>
rear end 12b being adapted for fluid communication with the brine line, constituting<br>
thereby a circumferential, brine outlet port 17b of the PV for the withdrawal of the brine<br>
therefrom.<br>
In operation, feed water F is provided to the circumferential, feed inlet port 17a<br>
at the front end 12a of the PV, to flow axially in the direction of arrows 19. Permeate P<br>
is collected by the permeate tube 12 to exit through the front and rear central ports 15a,<br>
15b, respectively, and brine (sometimes referred to as 'concentrate') B is removed<br>
through the circumferential outlet port 17b at the rear end 12b of the PV.<br>
In assembly, the membrane 10 is located within the PV 2 such that the front and<br>
rear permeate ports 15a, 15b are connected to the front and rear permeate lines 5<br>
respectively, the front circumferential port 17a is connected to the feed line 6, and the<br>
rear circumferential port 17b is connected to the brine line.<br>
When loading a membrane 10 into the PV 2, the membrane 10 is inserted into<br>
the PV 2 horizontally, and is displaced within the PV 2 until it reaches its desired<br>
location therein. When unloading a membrane 10, both ends of the PV 2 are opened,<br>
whereby the membrane 10 may be pushed from one side of the PV 2 to exit from the<br>
other side thereof.<br>
However, there have been known designs in which PVs are disposed vertically,<br>
i.e. the PV having a top end and a bottom end, and wherein loading and unloading of<br>
membranes was performed through the top end of the PV. Since loading and unloading<br>
of membranes is a generally complicated and time consuming process, such PVs are<br>
known to employ a small number of membranes, e.g. one or two, and of smaller<br>
diameter (and thus of correspondingly smaller weight).<br>
<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to different aspects of the present invention described below there are<br>
provided desalination systems, desalination membranes, arrangements for mounting<br>
desalination membranes in a desalination system, methods of their operations and<br>
methods for monitoring operation thereof which are particularly suitable for reverse<br>
osmosis (RO) desalination, but may be used in other types of desalination systems such<br>
as nano filtration (NF), micro filtration (MF) and ultra filtration (UF). It is suitable for<br>
spiral membrane described in detail in this description and suitable to hollow fiber<br>
membranes as well.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a desalination<br>
system comprising a plurality of elongated pressure vessels (PV) each having a<br>
longitudinal axis, oriented such that the longitudinal axis thereof is of a vertical<br>
orientation, each of said PVs being adapted to receive therein a plurality n of<br>
desalination membranes, the membranes located above the lowermost membrane within<br>
the PV having a total weight allowing them to function as a mechanism limiting axial<br>
expansion of the lowermost membrane, whereby the PV is free of any additional<br>
limiting mechanism.<br>
It should also be noted that due to the vertical orientation of the PVs, and the<br>
parameters n and D, the weight of the membranes also allows preventing displacement<br>
of the membranes within the PV during start and finish of the desalination process.<br>
Preventing thermal expansion of the membranes, as well as displacement thereof<br>
within the PV prevents twist of the o-rings which insulate the high pressure seawater<br>
area from low pressure desalinated product area, a twist which may cause loss of<br>
insulation and intrusion of seawater in to desalinated product.<br>
In addition, the above arrangement allows eliminating the need for a sWmming<br>
assembly adapted to prevent displacement of the membranes within the PV. Existing<br>
manual shimming methods are based on spacers and washers which are not effective as<br>
it requires opening the PVs several times a year for re-shimming. Existing automatic<br>
shimming mechanisms are complicated and usually not used.<br>
For example, D may be at least 20", more particularly, at least 18" and even<br>
more particularly, at least 16". For the latter case, i.e. 16" membranes, the number n of<br>
membranes may be at least 10, more particularly, at least 8, and even more particularly,<br>
<br>
at least 5. For membranes of a larger diameter, for example 18", the number n of<br>
membranes may be at least 8, more particularly, at least 6, and more particularly, at<br>
least 4. The above examples refer to desalination membranes having a weight of about<br>
80Kg.<br>
In particular, at a temperature difference of 15°C, thermal expansion effects may<br>
cause expansion of about 3mm for each membrane. It is thus also appreciated that in a<br>
horizontal configuration, such an expansion can prevent proper closing of the PV,<br>
requiring applying pressure to the membrane or shortening portions of the conduits<br>
thereof, a process elegantly avoided by using the above suggested vertical arrangement.<br>
The PVs may all be mounted on a horizontal base surface such that said<br>
longitudinal axis thereof is perpendicular to said horizontal base surface, i.e. is of a<br>
vertical orientation, allowing thereby loading and unloading of said membrane into said<br>
PV through the end of said PV remote from said horizontal base surface.<br>
With the above design, it may be possible to provide simultaneous loading and<br>
unloading of a plurality of membranes into a single PV, and uniform access to each of<br>
the PVs, from the same height level.<br>
Hereinafter, the end of said PV adjacent said horizontal base surface will be<br>
referred to as a 'bottom end' and the end remote from said horizontal base surface, i.e.<br>
the end through which loading and unloading is performed, will be referred to as a 'top<br>
end'. Said horizontal base surface will be referred to as 'bottom base surface'.<br>
The bottom and top ends of said PVs may be adapted for connection to bottom<br>
and top pipeline grids for supplying said system with fluid to be desalinated, removing<br>
from said system permeate produced thereby, and brine.<br>
Said bottom pipeline grid may be disposed on said bottom base surface, and said<br>
top pipeline grid may be disposed on a top base surface located above said bottom base<br>
surface. Thus, said bottom base surface may constitute a bottom service/maintenance<br>
platform at least for said bottom pipeline grid, and said top base surface may constitute<br>
a top service/maintenance platform at least for said top pipeline grid and for<br>
loading/unloading of said membranes.<br>
It should be noted that several configurations of the pipeline grids may be used<br>
in the above system, for example, one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) bottom pipeline grid may provide feed supply and front permeate<br>
removal, and top pipeline grid - brine and rear permeate removal;<br>
b) bottom pipeline grid may provide brine and rear permeate removal, and<br>
top pipeline grid - feed supply and front permeate removal; and<br>
c) a combination of the configurations (a) and (b) above, in which some of<br>
the PVs are connected according to the configuration (a) and some -<br>
according to configuration (b).<br>
When a PV accommodates therein a plurality of membranes, each having a<br>
longitudinal axis, said membranes are stacked one on top of the other with the<br>
longitudinal axes thereof coinciding with the longitudinal axis of said PV.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is therefore provided<br>
a membrane adapted to be received within a PV, said membrane comprising a main<br>
conduit, such as e.g. a permeate tube in a membrane, having a longitudinal axis defined<br>
therealong, a multi-layer membrane sheet wound around said main conduit, and an<br>
outer shell encapsulating said membrane sheet, wherein said outer shell is of such<br>
mechanical characteristics as to axially support, when located within said PV, most of<br>
the weight of a predetermined number of similar membranes stacked thereon.<br>
With respect to the above aspect of the present invention and the pipeline grid<br>
arrangements previously discussed, it should be appreciated that when using the<br>
pipeline grid configuration (a), the upward flow of the fluid to be desalinated applies<br>
pressure to the membranes in an upward direction, which may effectively reduce load<br>
exerted on the outer shell of each membrane.<br>
Alternatively, it should be appreciated that when using the pipeline grid<br>
configuration (b), the downward flow of the fluid to be desalinated applies pressure to<br>
the membranes in a downward direction, which may prevent displacement of the<br>
membranes within the PV during startup of the system, which may occur when using an<br>
upward flow.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
membrane comprising a main conduit having a longitudinal axis defined therealong,<br>
wherein said main conduit is adapted to engagingly receive therein an anchoring<br>
arrangement for suspension of said desalination membrane in a vertical orientation for<br>
insertion into a vertically oriented PV.<br>
<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an<br>
anchoring arrangement for suspension of a membrane having a central conduit of a<br>
diameter d, said anchoring arrangement comprising a central line with circumferential<br>
suspenders arranged therealong, wherein each of said suspenders is adapted to assume a<br>
first, retracted position in which the radial extension of each suspender about said line is<br>
of a diameter d1<d to allow insertion of the anchoring arrangement into said conduit in></d>
said retracted position, and a second, deployed position in which the radial extension of<br>
each suspender about said line is of a diameter d2&gt;d, to allow engagement between the<br>
suspenders and the central conduit's surface in said deployed position thereof.<br>
Said anchoring arrangement may be in the form of a hooking mechanism,<br>
adapted to engage anchoring elements pre-formed in said main conduit for suspension<br>
of said membrane. For example, said conduit may be formed with recesses adapted to<br>
receive corresponding hooks of said anchoring arrangement. It would be appreciated<br>
that said anchoring elements should not interfere with the operation of said membrane.<br>
Alternatively, said main conduit may have at least a layer of elastically<br>
deformable material, allowing deformation thereof without puncturing, and said<br>
anchoring arrangement may be formed with suspenders adapted to engage said<br>
deformable material by elastically deforming it to an extent sufficient to provide safe<br>
suspension of said membrane.<br>
According to one particular design, said suspenders may be in the form of<br>
projections, such that the anchoring arrangement has a bee sting like shape. According<br>
to another particular design, said suspenders may be in the form of an attachment<br>
member formed with a central portion and at least two end portions disposed on<br>
opposite sides of said central portion, said attachment member being hingedly<br>
articulated to said central line, allowing it to assume a first, loose position in which it<br>
extends generally parallel to the central line, and a second, attachment position in which<br>
it extends generally transverse to said central line. When in said loose position, said<br>
attachment member is adapted for displacement within said main conduit, and when in<br>
said attachment position, said end portions are adapted to bear against the inner surface<br>
of said main conduit to thereby firmly engage the membrane.<br>
According to a specific example, said anchoring arrangement may comprise at<br>
least one inflatable member adapted to assume a first, deflated position in which it may<br>
<br>
be inserted into said main conduit, and a second, inflated position, in which it is adapted<br>
to firmly engage the inner surface of the main conduit so as to allow anchoring said<br>
membrane, allowing, in turn, insertion/removal of said membrane into/from said PV<br>
cell.<br>
Said at least one inflatable member may be made of a resilient material, adapted,<br>
in said inflated position to assume greater dimensions than those assumed thereby in<br>
said deflated position. In particular, the dimensions of the inflatable member during the<br>
inflated position may be greater than the diameter of the main conduit.<br>
According to the above example, said inflatable member may be made of an<br>
impermeable material and be adapted to assume the inflated position due to introduction<br>
of a fluid (liquid or gas) material therein.<br>
The anchoring arrangement according to the above example may comprise a<br>
single inflatable member extending 360° about said central line and therealong, such<br>
that the load exerted on the anchoring arrangement by the weight of the membrane is<br>
evenly distributed about the central line. Alternatively, said anchoring arrangement may<br>
comprise a plurality of inflatable members equally disposed about the central line and<br>
therealong so as to evenly distribute the load exerted on the central line.<br>
According to yet another example, said anchoring arrangement may comprise a<br>
main body and a plurality of inflatable members, each being received within a groove<br>
formed in the main body. The inflatable members may be adapted for receiving air (or<br>
any other gas) from an external source.<br>
According to still a further example, the anchoring arrangement may comprise a<br>
central line, and have pivot elements hingedly articulated to said central line, each pivot<br>
element having a first end and a second end and fitted at each of the first and the second<br>
ends with a pressure plate adapted to engage the conduit of the membrane.<br>
The arrangement may be such that the pivot elements are articulated to the<br>
central line at a point which is offset from the center of the pivot element, i.e. the<br>
distance between the pivot point and the first end is greater than the distance between<br>
the pivot point and the second end. Thus, when the anchoring arrangement is vertically<br>
positioned, the asymmetry of the pivot elements may be adapted to bias the anchoring<br>
arrangement into the deployed position thereof.<br>
<br>
The above anchoring arrangement may be provided with a trigger element<br>
adapted to bias the anchoring arrangement into the retracted position, thus allowing it to<br>
be inserted into said conduit.<br>
When the membrane described above is assembled in a desalination system<br>
according to the first aspect of the invention, said membrane once suspended, may be<br>
brought to a desired location above the top end of a PV, such that the longitudinal axis<br>
of said membrane is aligned with the longitudinal axis of said PV. The membrane may<br>
then be lowered into said PV until it reaches its bottom end or abuts another membrane<br>
already located within said PV.<br>
When used with a PV in a vertical orientation, the anchoring arrangement<br>
described above allows simultaneous inserting thereto or removal therefrom of a<br>
plurality of membranes. In particular, with a plurality of membranes stacked one on top<br>
of the other such that their main conduits are aligned with one another, said anchoring<br>
arrangement may be inserted into the main conduit of the top membrane and lowered,<br>
optionally through main conduits of further membranes, until it reaches the main<br>
conduit of a desired membrane, and engage the latter conduit, whereby a plurality of<br>
membranes may be suspended from the anchoring arrangement simultaneously. To<br>
allow this, the engagement is to be strong enough to bear the weight of said plurality of<br>
membranes.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
two-stage anchoring arrangement adapted for removal of at least one desalination<br>
membrane from a top end of a vertically oriented PV, said anchoring arrangement<br>
comprising a first anchoring assembly adapted for fixed attachment to said PV, and a<br>
second anchoring assembly adapted for attachment to at least said one desalination<br>
membrane, wherein said second anchoring assembly is adapted to be vertically<br>
displaced, together with said desalination membrane, with respect to said first anchoring<br>
assembly, and said first anchoring assembly is adapted to be vertically displaced with<br>
respect to said PV, together with said second anchoring assembly and said desalination<br>
membrane.<br>
Said first anchoring assembly may be adapted for mounting onto a rail system<br>
allowing it to displace therealong. Said second anchoring assembly may be generally<br>
<br>
similar to the anchoring arrangement described with respect to a previous aspect of the<br>
present invention.<br>
A coupling may be provided between each two adjacent membranes adapted for<br>
sealingly connecting their adjacent ends in full alignment with each other.<br>
According to one example, the coupling may be provided by a coupling unit<br>
disposed internally to the main conduits of the membranes, which may have a first<br>
portion which may be fitted into the conduit of one membrane and a second portion<br>
which may be fitted into the conduit of the adjacent membrane. According to another<br>
example, said coupling unit may be in the form of a fastener disposed externally to the<br>
main conduits of the membranes.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
desalination system comprising at least one PV having a longitudinal axis, adapted to<br>
receive two or more desalination membranes therein, and an optional coupling adapted<br>
to connect to adjacent desalination membranes, said system further comprising a<br>
plurality of sensors disposed along said longitudinal axis, wherein each of said plurality<br>
of sensors is located at least in one of said PV, one of said desalination membranes and<br>
the optional coupling, and wherein each of said plurality of sensors is adapted to<br>
measure at least one of the following:<br>
a) quality of a fluid passing through at least one of said two or more<br>
desalination membranes; and<br>
b) flow rate of a fluid passing through at least one of said two or more<br>
desalination membrane.<br>
According to yet a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
coupling adapted to connect two adjacent desalination membranes, said coupling<br>
comprising at least one sensor adapted to measure at least one of the following:<br>
a) quality of a fluid passing through at least one of said membranes at the<br>
area of the coupling; and<br>
b) flow rate of a fluid passing through at least one of said membranes at the<br>
area of the coupling.<br>
According to still a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
desalination membrane comprising at least one sensor adapted to measure at least one of<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
c) quality of a fluid passing through said membrane; and<br>
d) flow rate of a fluid passing through said membrane.<br>
Said sensor may be operated continuously, measuring parameters throughout the<br>
operation of the desalination system. Alternatively, said sensor may be adapted to<br>
operate in bursts, sampling the above parameters along predetermined periods of time.<br>
Said sensor may be adapted to be operated using an internal power source such<br>
as, for example, a battery, or an external source e.g. by electrical induction therefrom.<br>
Said sensor may be adapted to transmit data produced based on the measurement<br>
taken thereby, to an outside source, for example a reader located outside said PV.<br>
Said sensor may also be adapted for operation by said reader, wherein said<br>
reader may even be used as an external power source therefor. Said reader may be<br>
adapted for displacement between different sensors, for positioning thereof adjacent<br>
said sensor. In this case, when the reader is positioned adjacent said sensor, electrical<br>
induction between the two articles may cause the sensor to take a measurement and<br>
provide the data to said reader. Transfer of the data from said sensor to said reader may<br>
be performed in a wireless manner.<br>
Said reader may be adapted for up and down displacement along a specific PV,<br>
on the outer side thereof, and be brought to locations aligned with different sensors, to<br>
allow any of its operations described above. To allow this mode of operation, a<br>
displacement mechanism may be provided, adapted for being displaced along a<br>
horizontal plane, which may be said top maintenance platform, and including a<br>
suspension device and cable having one end connected to said device and the other - to<br>
the reader for suspension thereof. The cable attaching the reader to said suspension<br>
device may be a data cable, and said device may be in turn connected, directly or<br>
wirelessly, to a Main Frame Computer (MFC), whereby all data collected by the reader<br>
may be transferred to said MFC.<br>
In operation of the desalination system, said displacement mechanism is<br>
positioned above an array of vertically oriented PVs and, to collect a measurement from<br>
one of the sensors accommodated within one of the vertically disposed PVs, the<br>
following steps may be performed:<br>
a) displacing said displacement mechanism along the horizontal plane to be<br>
located above the desired PV;<br>
<br>
b) displacing said reader along the PV's vertical direction to be aligned with<br>
said sensor;<br>
c) operating said sensor, possibly by the reader, to take the required<br>
measurement;<br>
d) collecting data of said measurement by the reader; and<br>
e) transferring said data to the MFC.<br>
In general, with respect to accessories such as the sensor, reader etc., the vertical<br>
orientation of the PVs may provide an easy manipulation of said accessories due to the<br>
vertical suspension, eliminating the need for intricate transport construction for<br>
horizontal displacement.<br>
Data collected from various sensors may be used to perform an analysis of<br>
conditions of different membranes within different PVs. For example, the analysis of<br>
the data collected from all the membranes of a specific P V, may provide an indication<br>
of failure or malfunction in one of the membranes.<br>
Once a faulty membrane has been detected it may be replaced. In order to<br>
replace such membrane in a PV, said anchoring arrangement, in a retracted position,<br>
may be inserted from the top end of the PV, into the main conduit of the membrane,<br>
possibly, having passed through main conduits of preceding membranes, i.e.<br>
membranes disposed closer to the top end of the PV than the damaged membrane. It<br>
may then proceed to assume its deployed position, to securely engage said damaged<br>
membrane and, optionally, all the preceding membranes stacked thereon, and may be<br>
raised, carrying said faulty membrane along with all of the preceding membranes<br>
positioned stacked thereon.<br>
The faulty membrane may then be displaced to a location outside the PV to rest<br>
on a surface, for example, said bottom maintenance surface, where said anchoring<br>
arrangement may disengage therefrom and proceed with picking up a replacement<br>
membrane to be inserted into said PV.<br>
In case only the faulty membrane has been removed from the PV, i.e. having not<br>
additional membranes stacked thereon, the anchoring arrangement may assume a<br>
retracted position, and be withdrawn upwards from the main conduit of said damaged<br>
membrane.<br>
<br>
In case said faulty membrane had stacked thereon a number of additional<br>
membranes, said anchoring arrangement may assume a retracted position in which it is<br>
withdrawn from the main conduit only of the faulty membrane, i.e. still being received<br>
within the main conduits of all preceding membranes. Once withdrawn, said anchoring<br>
arrangement may re-assume a deployed position, and thereby engage at least the bottom<br>
most preceding membrane, i.e. the membrane positioned directly above said damaged<br>
membrane. In this position, all of said preceding membranes may be suspended, and re-<br>
introduced into said PV.<br>
Upon re-introduction of said preceding membranes into said PV, said anchoring<br>
arrangement may further proceed with picking up a replacement membrane to replace<br>
said faulty membrane, and placing it on top of said preceding membranes within said<br>
PV. Alternatively, said anchoring arrangement may first insert a new membrane into<br>
said PV, and only then re-introduce said preceding membranes into said PV as<br>
previously described.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method for monitoring conditions of a plurality of desalination membranes in a PV,<br>
comprising: providing said membranes with sensors as described above, receiving input<br>
data collected from said sensors, analyzing said data and providing output data<br>
indicative of said conditions for at least one of said membranes.<br>
Said analysis may include normalization of values measured by at least one<br>
sensor so as to display a qualitative graph of the membrane conditions, in the form<br>
allowing alerting the operator of a possible malfunction without requiring the operator's<br>
knowledge of said values.<br>
The above method may allow, inter alia near real-time membrane malfunction<br>
detection, exact pin-pointing of faulty membranes, and an accurate, cost-effective<br>
measurement.<br>
According to still a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
desalination system comprising:<br>
a) an array of vertically disposed PVs, each PV accommodating one or<br>
more desalination membranes;<br>
b) a pipeline grid adapted for conducting fluid to be desalinated to said PVs<br>
and produced permeate from said PVs;<br>
<br>
c) a plurality of sensors disposed along the longitudinal axis of each PV,<br>
adapted to measure flow rate and/or quality of fluid passing through said<br>
one or more membranes; and<br>
d) a reader connected to an MFC adapted to be displaced along said PV, to<br>
be aligned with at least one of said plurality of sensors, to receive data<br>
therefrom.<br>
Said system may be completely automated and controlled by the MFC,<br>
removing me need for human personnel to perform measurements, replacement of<br>
membranes, etc. For example, each PV and each membrane therein may have their own<br>
index number recognizable by the MFC, whereby, upon detection of a damaged<br>
membrane, replacement of a membrane is performed as follows:<br>
a) the MFC receives the index number of the PV and the membrane<br>
required to be replaced;<br>
b) a command is given to the anchoring arrangement (also connected and<br>
controlled by the MFC) to move to a position above said PV; and<br>
c) said membrane is replaced as previously described.<br>
Said system may further be adapted for automatically performing the method of<br>
monitoring conditions of a plurality of desalination membranes in the PVs, as described<br>
above, whereby even detection of damaged membranes may be achieved in an<br>
automated fashion.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
desalination system comprising at least one row of PVs, each having a feed inlet at a<br>
first end thereof and a brine outlet at a second end thereof and containing at least one<br>
desalination membrane, said PV being adapted for passage of fluid to be desalinated<br>
between said first and said second end, wherein said feed inlet is fitted with a first<br>
sensor adapted for acquiring a first set of parameters of a test substance introduced into<br>
said fluid and passing therealong inside the PV, and said brine outlet is fitted with a<br>
second sensor adapted for acquiring a second set of parameters of the test substance.<br>
The acquired sets of parameters may be used in diagnosis of parameters of the<br>
fluid flowing through said PV from said fluid inlet to said fluid outlet.<br>
In particular, said first sensor and said second sensor may be adapted both for<br>
detecting the presence of said test substance and for detecting the concentration thereof.<br>
<br>
Thus, each sensor may provide two parameters: C - concentration of the test substance<br>
and t, the time the test substance was detected, thus yielding four parameters altogether.<br>
These parameters may be used for determining flow rate within each of the PVs. Exact<br>
formulas and explanations will be discussed in the detailed description.<br>
It is also appreciated that using the test substance for determining flow rate<br>
within the PVs, eliminates the need for complicated and costly flow meters. In addition,<br>
flow meters are generally equipped at a distal end of a main feed line, providing the<br>
feed for the entire row of PVs, and there is required a predetermined length of the main<br>
feed line before and after the location of the flow meter, before entering the row of PVs,<br>
in order to allow accurate measurement of the flow rate (e.g. for a feed line of diameter<br>
D, there is required a length equal to 2D before the flow meter and 5D after the flow<br>
meter to eliminate turbulence effects). Thus, using a test substance as suggested above,<br>
may effectively shorten the overall length of a row of PVs, thus contributing to a more<br>
compact and space-efficient arrangement of the PVs in the desalination system.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
desalination system comprising at least one common feed line having a first end and a<br>
second end, and at least one row of PVs arranged along said common feed line, each PV<br>
having a feed inlet at a first end thereof in fluid communication with said common feed<br>
line, and a brine outlet at a second end thereof, and containing at least one desalination<br>
membrane, each PV being adapted for passage of fluid to be desalinated between said<br>
first and said second end, wherein feed fluid is introduced into said common feed line<br>
from both said first and said second end thereof, i.e. said common feed line having a<br>
double-sided feed.<br>
It should be appreciated that when using a double-sided feed, the diameter of the<br>
common feed line may be reduced in half with respect to a common feed line having a<br>
one-sided feed. Reducing the diameter of the common feed line may allow closer<br>
spacing between two adjacent rows of PVs, thus further contributing to a more compact<br>
and space-efficient arrangement of the PVs in the desalination system.<br>
According to still a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
desalination facility comprising a structure having a roof, and adapted to be<br>
accommodated therein at least one PV having a distal end and a proximal end and a<br>
length L therebetween, and oriented such that said distal end is closer to said roof than<br>
<br>
said proximal end, wherein said PV is adapted for receiving at least one desalination<br>
membrane, loaded therein or unloaded therefrom via said distal end, and wherein there<br>
extends a distance M between said distal end and a roof portion located above said<br>
distal end, such that M 
Said at least one desalination membrane may be loaded/unloaded into/from said<br>
PV using an anchoring arrangement adapted for engaging said desalination membrane<br>
and displacing to/from said distal end, and said roof may be an adjustable roof designed<br>
such that at least a roof portion thereof located above said distal end is adapted to open<br>
so as to allow said anchoring arrangement to pass therethrough during said<br>
loading/unloading.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B show one example of a desalination system according to the<br>
present invention, which is a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system generally<br>
designated 20, comprising a plurality of pressure vessels (PVs) 30 mounted vertically<br>
on a base platform constituting a bottom base surface 21B and having a common top<br>
base surface 21T.<br>
Each PV 30 comprises a plurality of RO desalination membranes 40, stacked<br>
one on top of the other so that they are fully aligned.<br>
Each membrane 40 is of a construction similar to that of the known membrane<br>
10 shown in Fig. 2 and described in the Background of Invention. In particular, with<br>
reference to Figs. 4C and 4D, the membrane 40 comprises a permeate tube 42 having a<br>
central axis X and a diameter Dp, a membrane core 44 wound on the permeate tube 42,<br>
<br>
and an outer shell 46. However, the membrane 40 according to the present invention<br>
may have some specific features particularly suitable for the vertical disposition of the<br>
PVs, as will be explained in detail later.<br>
The bottom base surface 21B and the top base surface 21T have thereon<br>
respective bottom and top pipeline grids PGb and PGx- The bottom pipeline grid PGb<br>
includes a feed line 26 and a front permeate line 24F, and the top pipeline grid PGT<br>
includes a rear permeate line 24Ra and brine line 28.<br>
Each PV 30 has an essentially cylindrical body 32 having a diameter D ranging<br>
between about 8" and 16". The PV body 32 has bottom end 32B, formed with a feed<br>
inlet port 33, front permeate outlet port 34F, and a top end 32T formed with a brine<br>
outlet port 35 and rear permeate outlet port 34R. The PV 30 is fitted with a removable<br>
cover 31 at its top end 30T, in which at least the rear permeate outlet port 34R is formed<br>
as better seen in Fig. 4A.<br>
In assembly, the PVs 30 are positioned on the bottom base surface 21B<br>
vertically such that the feed inlet port 33 and the front permeate outlet port 34F are<br>
connected to the feed and front permeate lines 26,24F respectively, and the brine outlet<br>
port 35 and rear permeate outlet port 34R are connected to the concentrate and rear<br>
permeate lines 24R, 28 respectively, on the top base surface 21T. To align the above<br>
lines of the bottom and top pipeline grids with the corresponding ports of the PVs, the<br>
bottom base surface 21B and the top base surface 21T are formed with support channels<br>
23B and 23T in which these lines are received.<br>
With further reference to Fig. 3B, the PVs 30 are arranged in a plurality of rows<br>
having, mounted therebetween on the bottom base surface 21B, with the front permeate<br>
and feed lines 24F, 26 extending parallel to one another and parallel to the bottom base<br>
surface 21B. The rows of PVs 30 are sufficiently spaced from one another to allow an<br>
operator or a maintenance person to pass therebetween and attend to any maintenance<br>
issues such as malfunctions, routine checks etc. Therefore, the bottom base surface 21B<br>
constitutes a bottom maintenance surface for attending the bottom pipeline grid PGb<br>
and the top base surface 21T constitutes a top maintenance surface for attending the top<br>
pipeline grid PGb, and the membranes 40.<br>
It should however be appreciated that the above pipeline grid arrangement may<br>
be such that the inlet ports are located at the top end of the PV 30 and the outlet ports<br>
<br>
are located at the bottom end of the PV, such that the flow within the PVs is only in a<br>
downward direction. Such an arrangement may prevent displacement of membranes<br>
within the PV during the beginning of the PVs operation (i.e. fluid pushing the<br>
membranes in an upward direction), which tends to happen when using an upward flow.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 4A, the PV 30 is shown in a loading/unloading position, in<br>
which a group 41 of the membranes 40 is located outside the PV either prior to being<br>
loaded therein or after having been unloaded therefrom. In this position, the cover 31 is<br>
removed from the PV 30. An anchoring arrangement 50 displaceable along an<br>
anchoring line 60 is shown suspending the group 41 of the membranes 40 in the above<br>
described position. It should be noted that loading and unloading the membranes 40<br>
from the top end 30T allows simultaneous insertion of a plurality of membranes 40 into<br>
the PV 30. However, if desired the same anchoring arrangement 50 may be used to<br>
load/unload the membranes one by one.<br>
One possible design of the anchoring arrangement 50 is shown in Figs. 4C and<br>
4D. The anchoring arrangement 50 shown in these Figures comprises a central line 52,<br>
and circumferential suspenders 54 arranged therealong, each being formed with several<br>
membrane engaging elements 55 whose tips 57 may protrude from the central line 52 to<br>
a minimal extent (Fig. 4C) in which the suspender 54 is in its retracted position and has<br>
a diameter d1, and to a maximal extent (Fig. 4D) in which the suspender 54 is in its<br>
deployed position and has a diameter d2.<br>
In the retracted position, the membrane engaging elements 55 of each suspender<br>
54 are oriented approximately axially, i.e. along the central line 52, whereby the tips 57<br>
thereof define a diameter d1<dp of the suspender about central line where dp></dp>
is the diameter of the permeate tube 42 of the membrane 40. In this position, the<br>
anchoring arrangement 50 is freely displaceable along the permeate tube 42 of the<br>
membrane 40. In the deployed position, the membrane engaging elements 55 of each<br>
suspender 54 are oriented approximately radially, i.e. transverse to the central line 52,<br>
whereby the tips 57 thereof define a diameter d2&gt;DP of the suspender 54 about the<br>
central line 52. In this position, the tips 57 of the elements 55 of each suspender 54<br>
deform the permeate tube 42 of the membrane 40.<br>
The anchoring arrangement 50 or any alternative anchoring arrangement has to<br>
be designed so as engage the permeate tube 42 of the membrane 40 without damaging<br>
<br>
it. In this connection, it should be mentioned that, for use with the anchoring<br>
arrangement shown in Figs. 4C and 4D, the permeate tube 42 should be made of a<br>
deformable resilient material, allowing the suspenders to sink therein without<br>
puncturing it. Such a material may be for example FRP, PVC, PP.<br>
It should be appreciated that according to other possible designs, the permeate<br>
tube 42 may be preformed with recesses or indentations adapted to receive the tips 57 of<br>
the elements 55.<br>
The anchoring arrangement 50 further comprises an anchoring module 56<br>
attached in a displaceable manner to the anchoring line 60, and may also be equipped<br>
with a crane, monorail etc for raising and lowering the central line 52 with the<br>
membrane or several membranes 40 carried thereby.<br>
In operation, in order to suspend a membrane 40, the anchoring arrangement 50<br>
is first displaced along the anchoring line 60 to a location where it is positioned above<br>
the membrane 40, i.e. to a position in which the central line 52 of the anchoring<br>
arrangement is aligned with the central axis X of the permeate tube 42 of the membrane<br>
10. Thereafter, the central line 52 with the suspenders 54 in their retracted position is<br>
lowered by the anchoring module 56 until the portion of the central line 52 with the<br>
suspenders 54 is received within the permeate tube 42 of the membrane 40 (shown Fig.<br>
4C). Once the portion of the central line 52 is received within the permeate tube 42, the<br>
suspenders 54 assume their deployed position, in which their membrane engaging<br>
elements 55 sink into the permeate tube 42, thereby being securely engaged therewith<br>
(shown Fig. 4D). In this position, the membrane 40 may be suspended and displaced to<br>
a desired location.<br>
It is thus clear that the above described arrangement allows simultaneous<br>
suspension of a plurality of membranes 40, as shown in Fig. 4A, which in turn, allows<br>
fully loading a single PV 30 with membranes in one operation, and similar unloading of<br>
such membranes, e.g. when it is desired to replace a faulty membrane which is not the<br>
uppermost membrane in the PV. For a group of membranes 40 stacked one on another<br>
to be simultaneously loaded into, or unloaded from, a PV 30, the suspenders 54 may<br>
engage the permeate tubes of one of the following:<br>
• all the membranes 40 of the stack;<br>
<br>
• only some of the membranes 40 of the stack, including the lowermost<br>
membrane; and even<br>
• only the lowermost membrane 40 of the stack.<br>
In order to replace a faulty membrane in a PV, first, the PV 30 assumes a<br>
loading/unloading position (shown Fig. 4A) by removing the cover 31 thereof.<br>
Thereafter, the anchoring arrangement 50 is displaced horizontally along the anchoring<br>
line 60 to be positioned directly above the PV 30. Once in position, the central line 52<br>
of the anchoring arrangement 50, with the suspenders 54 in the retracted position<br>
(shown Fig. 4C) is inserted into the permeate tubes 42 of the preceding membranes<br>
(those disposed above the faulty membrane), until it is received within the permeate<br>
tube 42 of the faulty membrane. The suspenders 54 of the anchoring arrangement 50<br>
then proceed to assume the deployed position (shown Fig. 4C) whereby the suspenders<br>
54 securely engage the permeate tubes 42 of the faulty membrane and, if desired, all or<br>
a part of its preceding membranes.<br>
Once securely engaged, the central line 52 is raised along with the membranes<br>
40 suspended therefrom until the membranes are removed from the PV 30. Once<br>
removed, the anchoring arrangement 50 and membranes 40 may be displaced along the<br>
anchoring line 60 so as to bring the anchoring arrangement 50 and membranes 40, for<br>
example, above a repair platform (not shown). Thereafter, the central line 52 with the<br>
membranes is again lowered such that the faulty membrane rests on the repair platform.<br>
In this position of the membranes 40, the suspenders 54 of the anchoring<br>
arrangement 50 re-assume a retracted position, and the central line 52 is slightly raised<br>
so as to be removed from the faulty membrane, i.e. being received only within the<br>
permeate tubes 42 of the preceding membranes. Thereafter, the suspenders 54 may re-<br>
assume a deployed position so as to securely engage the permeate tubes 42 of the<br>
preceding membranes. The preceding membranes may then be returned to the PV 30 in<br>
a similar manner.<br>
The preceding membranes may be first returned to the PV 30 and thereafter a<br>
new membrane 40 is inserted into the PV on top of the preceding membranes.<br>
Alternatively, the new membrane may first be inserted into the PV 30, and only then are<br>
the preceding membranes positioned on top of the new membrane.<br>
<br>
Once the membranes 40 have been re-introduced in the PV 30, the top cover 31<br>
is be placed back on top of the PV 30, thereby bringing the PV to its working position.<br>
In this respect, it should be noted that it is often the case that when a membrane<br>
is positioned within the PV for an extensive amount of time, chemical residue, scaling<br>
fouling and other materials accumulate between the outer shell of the membrane and the<br>
inner surface of the PV, thereby causing the desalination membrane to become lodged1<br>
within the PV, i.e. of low susceptibility for changing its position along the longitudinal<br>
axis of the PV. Thus, when attempting to remove such a desalination membrane, it is<br>
first required to release the membrane from its 'lodged' position before removing it from<br>
the PV.<br>
The loads exerted on the anchoring arrangement 50 during such 'unlodging' of<br>
the desalination membrane are far greater than the loads exerted thereon during<br>
suspension of the membrane. One possible solution for this problem would be the use of<br>
a more robust anchoring arrangement and crane, capable of withstanding the loads<br>
applied thereto during 'unlodging'. However, it is appreciated that such a solution would<br>
be an 'over-design' since the 'unlodging' operation only takes up a brief amount of time<br>
with respect to the entire time required for the loading/unloading operation.<br>
Another solution is shown with reference to Figs. 7A to 7C, in which a two-<br>
stage anchoring arrangement generally designated AR adapted for the removal of one or<br>
more membranes from the PV is shown comprising a first-stage anchoring assembly<br>
generally designated 110 and a second-stage anchoring assembly constituted by the<br>
previously disclosed anchoring arrangement 50, of which only the central line 52 is<br>
shown.<br>
The two-stage anchoring arrangement is designed such that at a first-stage of<br>
unloading the first-stage assembly 110 releases the desalination membrane from its<br>
'lodged' position, whereas at a second-stage of unloading, the anchoring arrangement 50<br>
previously described proceeds with the suspension and displacement of the desalination<br>
membrane to a desired location.<br>
The first-stage anchoring assembly 110 comprises a PV attachment section 120<br>
adapted for attachment to a distal end of a PV, and a second-stage attachment section<br>
130 adapted for attachment to the second-stage anchoring assembly 50. The sections<br>
<br>
120, 130 are spaced apart by a spacing array 140, adapted to provide a desalination<br>
membrane with sufficient space to displace in during the first stage of unloading.<br>
It should also be appreciated that this space is primarily useful when the PV is<br>
fully stacked with desalination membranes, i.e. the desalination membranes take up all<br>
the space within the PV. In other words, the desalination membrane positioned closest<br>
to the PV end through which unloading is performed, is located at the distal end itself.<br>
Thus, it should also be understood that for a PV which is not fully stacked, the first and<br>
second sections 120,130 may be used without the spacing array 140.<br>
The PV attachment section 120 is formed with a circular disc 122 formed with a<br>
central opening 121, and having an anchoring face 122a and a PV face 122b, such that<br>
when the first-stage anchoring assembly 110 is mounted onto the PV 30, the anchoring<br>
face 122a faces the second-stage anchoring section 130, and the PV face 122b faces the<br>
distal end of the PV. The PV face 122b of the circular disc 122 has a contact area 123<br>
adapted for coming in contact with a lip 39 (shown Fig. 7C) of the distal end of the PV<br>
30 when mounted thereon.<br>
The PV attachment section 120 further comprises three centering elements 124<br>
attached to the PV face 122b, each being formed with an inclined portion adapted to<br>
come in contact with an outer surface 32 of the PV 30. The centering elements 124 are<br>
equally disposed about the central axis X of the circular disc 122 (i.e. at 120° intervals)<br>
to thereby allow the first-stage anchoring assembly 120 to become aligned with the PV,<br>
i.e. such that the central axis X of the circular disc is aligned with the longitudinal axis<br>
ofthePV30.<br>
The second-stage attachment section 130 is also formed with a circular disc 132<br>
formed with a central opening 134, and further comprising an anchoring piston 136<br>
attached to an anchoring line 137 adapted for attachment to the second-stage anchoring<br>
assembly 50. The anchoring piston 136 further comprises a lifting eye 138 adapted for<br>
attachment to a main crane (not shown), which is in turn adapted to displace the entire<br>
anchoring arrangement from the PV 30.<br>
The spacing array 140 comprises a plurality of spacing rods 142 extending<br>
between a peripheral portion of the circular disc 122 of the PV attachment section 120<br>
and a corresponding peripheral portion of the circular disc 132 of the second-stage<br>
<br>
anchoring attachment section 130. Each of the spacing rods 142 is secured in place<br>
using nuts 144 and 146.<br>
With particular reference to Fig. 7C, it is observed that the PV 30 is formed with<br>
a thickened top end 37 and has an upper lip 39, such that when positioned on the top<br>
end of the PV 30, the contact area 123 of the PV face 122 is flush against the lip 39 of<br>
the PVs top end, and the inclined portions 126 of the centering elements 126 are flush<br>
against the outer surface of the PVs top end.<br>
The arrangement is such that when the second-stage anchoring assembly 50 is<br>
attached to the anchoring line 137, activation of the piston 136 entails withdrawal of the<br>
central line 52 from the PV and in turn of the entire second-stage anchoring assembly<br>
52, thus disengaging the membrane/s from their 'lodged' position within the PV 30. It is<br>
appreciated that the great loads required for 'unlodging' the membrane are now taken<br>
not by the main crane (not shown) but by the construction of the first-stage anchoring<br>
assembly 110, by using the PV 30 itself as fulcrum, in a manner similar to the operation<br>
of a cork-screw.<br>
Once the membrane/s is 'unlodged' and is able to freely slide within the PV, the<br>
main crane lifts the first-stage anchoring assembly 110 using the lifting eye 138, along<br>
with the second-stage anchoring assembly and the suspended membrane/s, to displace<br>
the membrane/s to a desired location.<br>
With reference to Figs. 8A to 8G, the second-stage anchoring assembly may be<br>
of various designs, and not limited to the previously disclosed design of the anchoring<br>
arrangement 50.<br>
With particular reference to Figs. 8A and 8B, another design of a second-stage<br>
anchoring arrangement is shown generally designated as 150, and comprising a central<br>
line 152, pivot elements 155 adapted to pivot thereabout, and pressure plates 157<br>
adapted to engage the inner surface of the main conduit 42 of the membrane 40.<br>
The central line 152 is formed with two fork portions 153 with a gap extending<br>
therebetween. Within the gap, several pivot elements 155 (in the present example only<br>
two pivot elements are shown) are pivotally hinged via pivot points 154. It is observed<br>
that the pivot point 154 is not located at the middle of the pivot element 155, but rather<br>
is offset to form two asymmetric portions - 155a and 155b, 155a being slightly longer<br>
than the latter.<br>
<br>
The pivot elements 155 are fitted with pressure plates 157 which are pivotally<br>
attached to each portion 155a, 155b via a hinge 158 formed in a slat 156 projecting<br>
from the pressure plate 157.<br>
The arrangement is such that the second-stage anchoring assembly 150 may<br>
assume a first, retracted position in which the pivot elements 155 extend generally<br>
parallel to the central line 152, whereby the assembly 150 may be inserted into the main<br>
conduit 42 of the membrane 40, and a second, deployed position, in which the pivot<br>
elements 155 are generally transverse to the central line 152 such that the pressure<br>
plates 157 come in contact with the inner surface of the main conduit 42 to apply<br>
pressure thereto. The pressure on the inner surface of the membrane's conduit 42 should<br>
be sufficient so as to allow suspension of the membrane 40.<br>
The anchoring arrangement 150 may be biased, due to gravitational forces into<br>
its deployed position, since the portion 155a overweighs the portion 155b, operating in<br>
a manner similar to a parallelogram mechanism. Thus, the transfer from the deployed<br>
position to the retracted position is achieved using a trigger element (not shown) which<br>
may be in the form of an electric motor, a pulling rod or the like.<br>
In operation, the second-stage anchoring assembly 152 is inserted into the main<br>
conduit 42 in its retracted position until it reaches the desired membrane/location.<br>
Thereafter, the operation of the trigger element is halted, allowing the anchoring<br>
arrangement 150 to displace, due to gravitational forces, to its deployed position such<br>
that the pressure plates 157 are flush against the inner surface of the main conduit 42. In<br>
this position, since the portions 155a and 155b are not of equal length, pulling on the<br>
central line 152 will cause the pivot elements 155 to pivot about the pivot point 154,<br>
biasing them further towards the deployed position, thus increasing the pressure applied<br>
to the inner surface of the main conduit and providing firmer engagement between the<br>
anchoring assembly 150 and the desalination membrane 40.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 8C, a further design of the second-stage anchoring<br>
assembly is shown generally designated as 160 and comprising a central line 162, a<br>
main chamber 164, and a peripheral inflatable portion 166.<br>
The central line 162 is formed with an air inlet 163 adapted to provide air to the<br>
main chamber 164, which is in turn formed with a plurality of discharge apertures 165<br>
<br>
adapted to deliver the air into the peripheral inflatable portion 166 made of an<br>
impermeable material.<br>
The anchoring assembly 160 may assume a first, deflated position in which the<br>
peripheral inflatable portion 166 assumes a diameter D1 smaller than the inner diameter<br>
of the main conduit 42, thus allowing the anchoring assembly 160 to freely displace<br>
within and along the main conduit 42, and a second, inflated position in which the<br>
peripheral inflatable portion 166 assumes a diameter D2 greater than the inner diameter<br>
of the main conduit 42, thereby applying pressure thereto and allowing, due to forces of<br>
friction, to suspend the membrane 40. In the inflated position, a gap 168 extends<br>
between the peripheral inflatable portion 166 and the wall of the main chamber 164.<br>
In operation, the anchoring assembly 160 is displaced, in it deflated position,<br>
within the main conduit 42 until a desired location is reached. Thereafter, air (or any<br>
other gas for that matter) is provided through the air inlet 163 to the main chamber 164<br>
and from there to the peripheral inflatable portion 166 via apertures 165. The<br>
introduction of air into the peripheral inflatable portion 166 causes it to inflate such that<br>
it increases its diameter from Dl to D2, thereby engaging the inner surface of the main<br>
conduit 42 of the membrane.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 8D, a still further design of the second-stage anchoring<br>
assembly is shown generally designated as 170 and having a similar construction to the<br>
anchoring assembly 160 previously disclosed. However, in the present design the<br>
anchoring assembly comprises a main body 174 and a plurality of individually<br>
inflatable portions 176, adapted to receive air (or any other gas) not via the central line<br>
172 and main body 174 but rather directly therein from an air source (not shown).<br>
The main chamber 172 is formed, on the outer side thereof with a plurality of<br>
grooves 175 adapted to accommodate the inflatable portions 176. The inflatable<br>
portions 176 may be retained within the grooves 175 by any known method maintaining<br>
the impermeability of the inflatable portions 176. Alternatively, the inflatable portions<br>
may not be secured to the groves 175, but rather be suspended along with the main body<br>
174 and anchored to it at a top end thereof.<br>
Much like the previously disclosed anchoring assembly 170, the anchoring<br>
assembly 170 is adapted to assume a first, deflated position in which the peripheral<br>
inflatable portions 176 are deflated such that the diameter Dl of the anchoring assembly<br>
<br>
170 is smaller than the inner diameter of the main conduit 42, thus allowing the<br>
anchoring assembly 170 to freely displace within and along the main conduit 42, and a<br>
second, inflated position in which the inflatable portions 176 assume a diameter D2<br>
greater than the inner diameter of the main conduit 42, thereby applying pressure<br>
thereto and allowing, due to forces of friction, to suspend the membrane 40.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 8H to 8J, a still further design of the second-stage<br>
anchoring assembly is shown generally designated as 180 in the form of an anchoring<br>
adapter adapted for attachment to the proximal most membrane 40 positioned within the<br>
PV, i.e. the membrane the main conduit 42 of which is sealingly connected to the front<br>
permeate port 34F of the PV. More particularly, the proximal most membrane<br>
(lowermost) is formed with a fluid adaptor connecting the membrane to the front<br>
permeate line. This adapted is either replaced or modified so as to become attached to<br>
the anchoring adaptor 180.<br>
The anchoring assembly 180 comprises a bayonet ring 182 adapted for fixed<br>
attachment to the end of the main conduit 42 such that it is positioned between this end<br>
and the front permeate port 34F, and a bayonet stub 184 adapted for fixed attachment to<br>
a central line (not shown), and bayonet engagement with the bayonet ring 184. The<br>
bayonet ring 182 and the bayonet stub 184 are formed with respective bayonet element<br>
183 and 185.<br>
Thus, when it is desired to remove one or more membranes 40 from the PV, the<br>
central line is lowered along with the bayonet stub 184 until the stub 184 reaches the<br>
bayonet ring 182. Thereafter, the bayonet stub 184 may engage the bayonet ring 182<br>
whereby pulling the central line will entail displacement of the lower most membrane<br>
40 along with any additional membranes located thereabove.<br>
It should be pointed out that the anchoring assembly 180 as disclosed above is<br>
adapted for use in conjunction only with the lower most membrane. However, a similar<br>
anchoring assembly may be designed in which one or more bayonet rings are located<br>
between each two desalination membranes 40.<br>
With respect to all previously disclosed second-stage anchoring assemblies 50,<br>
150, 160, 170 and 180, it should be appreciated that the anchoring portion of the<br>
<br>
anchoring assembly may extend along the entire central line thereof, i.e. such that when<br>
inserted into the main conduit it extends the full length thereof. Alternatively, the<br>
anchoring assembly may be designed such that anchoring portion extends only a length<br>
equal to the length of a single membrane, or any multiple of that length.<br>
In addition, with respect to the entire anchoring arrangement described above, it<br>
should be appreciated that the anchoring arrangement and the main crane may operate<br>
as separate elements. In other words, the anchoring arrangement may be used for<br>
displacing the membranes 40 from their position in the PV 30 to a predetermined<br>
amount so as to 'unjam' them, then returning the membranes to their original location<br>
within the PV and thereafter disengaging from the membranes 40. In this position, when<br>
the membranes are no longer 'lodged', the main crane may be used in conjunction with<br>
an anchoring assembly generally similar to the second-stage anchoring assembly<br>
previously disclosed in order to engage the membranes and removing them from the<br>
PV.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 9, a crane construction generally designated as 200 is<br>
shown comprising a wench mechanism 210, an up-down rail 220, a front-back rail 230<br>
and a right-left rail 240.<br>
The wench mechanism 210 comprises a wench 212 with a wench line 214<br>
wrapped thereon, and a wench housing 216. The wench housing 216 is fixedly<br>
articulated to two rails 222 of the up-down rail 220.<br>
The brackets 224 of the up-down rail 220 are slidingly received within parallel<br>
rails 232 of the front-back rail 230, allowing the entire up-down rail 220, along with the<br>
wench mechanism 210 to displace in the horizontal direction along the X axis. Extreme<br>
portions of the front-back rail 230 are fitted with wheels 234 adapted to roll along<br>
parallel rails 242 of the right-left rail 240, allowing the entire front back rail 230, along<br>
with the up-down rail 220 and the wench mechanism 210 to displace in the horizontal<br>
direction along the Y axis.<br>
The entire crane construction is adapted to be positioned above the PV array of a<br>
desalination facility, such that above arrangement allows displacement of the wench<br>
mechanism 210 along the main X, Y and Z directions, so that the wench mechanism<br>
210 may be brought to position above any one of the PVs and to a specific height<br>
thereabove.<br>
<br>
An unloading operation using the wench mechanism and the two-stage<br>
anchoring arrangement will now be described. At the beginning of the unloading<br>
operation, the rails 222 along with the wench mechanism 210 are located in a downward<br>
position, i.e. the wench mechanism 210 is adjacent the brackets 224 and the rails 222<br>
extend vertically below the rails 232 and 242. To the wench line 214 there is attached<br>
the two-stage anchoring arrangement (shown Figs. 7A to 7C) including the first-stage<br>
anchoring assembly 110 and a second-stage anchoring assembly which may be any one<br>
of the anchoring assemblies 50, 150, 160, 170 or 180.<br>
Thereafter, the entire up-down rail 220 is displaced along the rails 232 and 242<br>
to bring it into position above the desired PV from which one or more membranes are to<br>
be removed. Once in position, the wench mechanism 210 is activated to lower the<br>
wench line 214 along with the two-stage anchoring arrangement towards the top end of<br>
the PV 30.<br>
The two-stage anchoring arrangement is lowered until the first-stage anchoring<br>
assembly 110 may be fixed to the top end of the PV 30. Once fixed, the central line of<br>
the second-stage anchoring assembly is lowered until it engages the desired membrane<br>
as previously discussed with respect to Figs. 8A to 8G. Once engaged, an released by<br>
the first-stage anchoring assembly 110, the wench line 214 is raised by the wench<br>
mechanism 210 to raise the two-stage anchoring arrangement along with suspended<br>
membrane/s to a desire amount.<br>
Thereafter, the wench mechanism 210 along with the rails 222 are raised along<br>
the brackets 224, and the entire up-down rail 220 is brought to a new location by<br>
displacement along the rails 232 and 242.<br>
It should also be appreciated that the up-down rail 220 along with the wench<br>
mechanism 210 may be an add-on arrangement mounted onto a conventional crane<br>
construction comprising the right-left rail 240 and the front-back rail 230, which is used<br>
for various tasks in the desalination facility other than loading/unloading of membranes.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 9B, the crane construction 200 is shown when located<br>
within a structure comprising a roof structure generally designated as 300, comprising a<br>
roof surface 302 and an adjustable portion 304. It is observed that the distance between<br>
the roof surface 302 and the rails 232 and 242 M is much smaller than the length L of<br>
the up-down rail 220. Thus, the adjustable portion 304 of the roof structure 300 is<br>
<br>
adapted to open up to the position shown in Fig. 9B, such that there is formed an<br>
opening 306 in the roof surface, allowing the rails 222 along with the wench mechanism<br>
210 to displace upwards.<br>
It is noted that although shown here to be opened via a hinge, the roof portion<br>
may be in the form of slidable slats, removable slats, a telescopic arrangement or the<br>
like.<br>
It is also appreciated that the roof structure 300 may be formed with a plurality<br>
of adjustable roof portions 304 corresponding to the number of PVs 30 located within<br>
the structure, thereby allowing loading/unloading of membrane/s to/from any one of the<br>
PVs 30 located within the structure. In addition, the roof portions may be adapted to be<br>
opened above an entire row of PVs allowing the crane construction to displace freely<br>
along the row.<br>
In addition, according to a particular design, the crane construction 200 may be<br>
positioned outside the structure, i.e. above the roof, and be lowered through the roof,<br>
e.g. through an open roof portion during loading/unloading of a membrane.<br>
Furthermore, it is appreciated that such an arrangement provides for a<br>
considerably more compact design of the structure, and the roof thereof may be located<br>
in close proximity to the top ends of the PVs 30.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 5A and 5B, a plurality of membranes 40 are shown housed<br>
within the PV 30, being stacked one on top of another, with their permeate tubes 42<br>
being in full alignment to form a common permeate tube of the PV 30. Each membrane<br>
40, or at least the lowermost one, and the front permeate outlet port 34F, are designed<br>
so that upon the membrane's taking its position at the bottom end 32B of the PV 30, its<br>
permeate tube 42 is sealingly connected to the front permeate outlet port 34F.<br>
Similarly, each membrane 40, or at least the uppermost one, and the cover 31 are<br>
designed so that upon placing the cover 31 in its position at the top end 32T of the PV<br>
30, the rear permeate outlet port 34R formed in the cover is sealingly connected to the<br>
permeate tube 42 of the uppermost membrane.<br>
The membranes 40 are further adapted for connection to each other. For this<br>
purpose, the permeate tube 42, and the outer shell 46 of each membrane 40 extends<br>
axially more than the spiral wound elements 44, i.e. each permeate tube 42 and outer<br>
shell 46 have an extension portion 43 and 48 beyond the spiral wound element 44. Thus,<br>
<br>
when two membranes 40a, 40b are positioned as shown in Fig. 5B, the extension<br>
portions 43a, 43b of their permeate tubes 42a and 42b come in contact with one<br>
another, and so do the extension portions 48a, 48b of their outer shells 46a and 46b.<br>
The weight of the upper membrane 40a is therefore supported mostly by the<br>
outer shell 46b of the lower membrane 40b. For this purpose, the outer shell 46 of each<br>
the membrane 40 is designed with a sufficient thickness, and of proper material to allow<br>
the outer shell 46 to support the weight of a desired number of membranes 40 stacked<br>
thereon. Such a material may be, for example, FRP fibers and/or epoxy.<br>
Fig. 5B shows one possible manner of coupling the two membranes 40a, 40b to<br>
one another. This is achieved by using a coupling 70 in the form of a fastener 72<br>
mounted on exterior of the extension portions 43a, 43b of the permeate tubes 42a, 42b<br>
for providing secure sealed engagement therebetween. The fastener 72 of the coupling<br>
70 may alternatively be mounted on the interior of the extension portions 43a, 43b of<br>
the permeate tubes 42 (not shown).<br>
The coupling may optionally comprise a sensing system for measuring<br>
operational parameters of the membranes 40 and/or fluid passing therethrough, for<br>
determining the functioning condition of the membranes.<br>
Fig. 5B shows one such sensing system comprising two sensors 74 and 76,<br>
adapted to respectively measure the quality and flow rate of water passing through the<br>
coupling 70 in a manner known per se.<br>
Each sensor 74, 76 may be operated continuously, measuring parameters<br>
throughout the operation of the desalination system 20. Alternatively, each sensor 74,<br>
76 may be adapted to operate in bursts, sampling the above parameters along<br>
predetermined periods of time, or upon prompt from an external source.<br>
Each sensor 74, 76 is also adapted to transmit data produced based on the<br>
measurement taken thereby, to an external source, for example a reader located outside<br>
said PV 30 as will be further explained with reference to Fig. 5A.<br>
The sensors 74, 76 may be adapted to be operated using an internal power<br>
source such as, for example, a battery, or an external source e.g. by electrical induction<br>
therefrom.<br>
It should be indicated that the location of the sensors 74, 76 is not restricted to<br>
the coupling 70 and they may be located within the permeate tube 42, within the spiral<br>
<br>
wound element 44 and even on the inner sidewall of the PV 30. In general, the sensors<br>
74, 76, or any other devices for measuring operational parameters of the membranes 40<br>
and/or fluid passing therethrough, may be located anywhere along the axial extension of<br>
the membranes 40. It should however, be appreciated that sensor 76 adapted to measure<br>
the quality of water passing through the PV 30 is required to come in direct contact with<br>
the fluid, e.g. feed, permeate, reject, passing through the membranes 40.<br>
With reference to Fig. 5A, the system 20 may be further provided with a data<br>
reading arrangement 80 comprising a reader 82, a cable 84 and a displacement<br>
mechanism 86 adapted for connection to an anchoring line 60 and optionally to a<br>
mainframe computer (MFC). The data reading arrangement 80 is designed so as to be<br>
horizontally displaceable by the displacement mechanism 86, and the reader 82 is<br>
designed so as to be vertically displaceable by the cable 84.<br>
The reader 82 is adapted to constitute a power source for the sensors 74, 76,<br>
whereby upon being positioned adjacent one of the sensors, electrical induction between<br>
the two articles activates the sensor 74, 76 to take a measurement and provide the<br>
measured data back to the reader 82. Transfer of the data from the sensor to the reader is<br>
performed in a wireless manner.<br>
In assembly, the displacement mechanism 86 is positioned above an array of<br>
vertically oriented PVs 30 of the system 20 all of which may have sensors as described<br>
above. In order to collect a measurement from one of the sensors 74, 76 accommodated<br>
within one of the vertically disposed PVs 30, the following steps are performed:<br>
a) horizontally displacing the displacement mechanism 86 for its location<br>
above a desired PV 30;<br>
b) displacing the reader 82 downwards along the PV 30 to be aligned with<br>
the sensor 74, 76;<br>
c) operating the sensor 74, 76 by the reader 82, to take the required<br>
measurement;<br>
d) collecting data from the sensor 74, 76 by the reader 82; and<br>
e) transferring the data to the MFC.<br>
In practice, the above steps may be performed for every one of the membranes<br>
40 of each PV 30 in order to receive as much data as possible.<br>
<br>
In general, the vertical orientation of the PVs 30 facilitates the manipulation of<br>
accessories such as the reader 82 and anchoring arrangement 50, and of the membranes<br>
40. This in turn eliminates the need for intricate transport construction for horizontal<br>
displacement of these elements, used in known desalination systems with horizontally<br>
oriented PVs.<br>
Fig. 6A shows measurements which may be taken from membranes #1 to #7 of<br>
a single PV 30 by the reader 82. The set of measurements 90 includes measurements 91<br>
to 97 denoting the flow rate through the spiral wound element 44, i.e. osmosis rate, and<br>
the set of measurements 100 includes measurements 101 to 107 denoting salinity on<br>
either the reject or the permeate sides of the spiral wound element 44, each<br>
measurement corresponding to one of the membranes #1 to #7.<br>
As may be observed from the above taken measurements, as water progresses<br>
through the PV 30 the salinity of the reject increases while the osmosis rate through the<br>
spiral wound element 44 decreases. This, however, does not indicate to an operator of<br>
the system 20 of any malfunction or damage in any one of the membranes #1 to #7.<br>
Turning to Fig. 6B, the measurements are shown again after performing an<br>
analysis of the data including normalization of the values thereof. It may now be<br>
observed that membrane #3 demonstrates a lower osmosis rate and higher salinity on<br>
the reject side than all the other membranes #1 to #2 and #4 to #7. This might indicate<br>
to operator that membrane #3 is damaged and needs to be replaced. It would be noted<br>
here that the analysis of the data allows providing a graphic display of the functionality<br>
of the PVs membranes, without the operator being required to understand the true<br>
meaning of the displayed measurements. In other words, the operator is simply required<br>
to identify a membrane which demonstrated a functionality which is exceptional to the<br>
other membranes.<br>
It would be appreciated that all operations described hereinbefore, including<br>
loading of a PV 30, collecting measurements, detecting a faulty membrane, and<br>
replacing a faulty membrane may be accomplished by a completely automated process<br>
controlled by the MFC, without requiring an operator to be present. For example, the<br>
MFC may be programmed such that the data reading arrangement 80 systematically<br>
collects measurements from all membranes 40 of the system 20, the MFC analyzes the<br>
<br>
collected data, and upon detection of a faulty membrane, automatic replacement of the<br>
membrane is performed as described above.<br>
For this purpose, each of the PVs 30, and each of the membranes 40 may be<br>
equipped with an indexing module, denoting the exact location of the PV 30 and<br>
membrane 40 within a specific PV 30. The indexing allows the MFC to pin-point the<br>
exact location of a membrane 40, indicating to the anchoring module 56 and<br>
displacement mechanism 86 exactly where to be displaced.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 10A to 10C, there are demonstrated a structure and method<br>
for measuring flow rate of fluid within the PV 30. The PV is shown comprising a feed<br>
inlet Fin attached to a feed line, a brine outlet B attached to a brine line, a front products<br>
Pf outlet and a rear product outlet Pr. The feed line is provided with a test substance<br>
inlet R and a first test sensor S1, and the brine line is provided with a second test sensor<br>
In operation, in order to measure flow rate, a test substance, e.g. Rhodamine, is<br>
introduced into the test substance inlet R, wherein it is first detected by the first test<br>
sensor S1 and thereafter passed along with the fluid to be desalinated towards the brine<br>
outlet B of the PV, where it is detected by the second test sensor S2.<br>
Each of the sensors S1, S2 provides two measured parameters of the test<br>
substance - its concentration C, and the time of measurement t. Thus, the chart shown<br>
in Fig. 10C may be produced denoting the average time tF in which the Rhodamine was<br>
introduced into the PV and its concentration Cf at that time, and the average time tB the<br>
Rhodamine has exited the PV and its concentration Cb at that time.<br>
From the above data, obtained for each of the PVs, the flow rate Q for each PV<br>
may be calculated by the following set of equations:<br>
Membrane mass balance equation: QFeed = QProduct + QBrine;<br>
Rhodamine mass balance equation: QFeed • CFeed = QProduct • CProduct + QBrine • CBrine;<br>
It is noted that the Rhodamine molecules are too big in order to penetrate<br>
through the wall of the membrane, and therefore all Rhodamine entering the PV<br>
remains on the brine side of the membrane, and hence, the concentration CProduct = 0.<br>
Thus, the following equations are yielded:<br>
<br>
The recovery rate is given by the formula <br>
The above yields the following equations: and<br>
Using the equations denoting the flow rate through the PV it may be stated that:<br>
 where A is the area of the cross section for fluid flow,<br>
L is the length of the PV and ?t is denoted by tF-tB.<br>
Thus, the following equation is yielded:<br>
 and equation in which all parameter are either known from the<br>
design of the PV or obtained by the sensors S1, S2.<br>
The above arrangement of sensors and calculation provides the flow rate for<br>
each of the PVs.<br>
In addition, it should be appreciated that using such a method for measuring the<br>
flow rate eliminates the need for costly flow meters and additional pipe design required<br>
for use thereof (generally, in order to measure flow rate properly, a flow meter is<br>
required to be positioned within a pipe segment in which non-turbulent flow takes<br>
place, requiring in turn a pipe segment of 2D before the flow meter and 5D after the<br>
flow meter, D being the diameter of the pipe).This contributes considerably to a more<br>
compact and space-efficient design of the entire desalination system.<br>
In addition, with reference to Fig. 10B, it is observed that the PV receives the<br>
feed inlet from a common feed line, associated with each and every PV in the same row<br>
(other PVs not shown). Thus, the common feed line has a first end associated with the<br>
first end of the PV row, and a second end associated with the second end of the PV row.<br>
In the present example, the common feed line is adapted to receive the feed fluid from<br>
both the first end and the second end (double-sided feed), thus allowing reduction of the<br>
diameter D of the pipe.<br>
Reducing the diameter of the pipe allows a more dense spacing between<br>
corresponding rows of PVs.<br>
With particular reference to Figs. 11A and 11B, Fig. 11A demonstrates a<br>
desalination system comprising a plurality of rows of PVs in which flow meters are<br>
used along with one-sided feed, and Fig. 11B demonstrates another desalination system<br>
comprising the same number of PVs, in which a test substance is used along with a<br>
double-side feed.<br>
In Fig. 11B, the length of the entire system is L, and the width is W, this for a<br>
common feed line of diameter D. It is also observed that the common feed line CFL has<br>
a diameter D. To the contrary, in Fig. 11B, the CFL has a diameter d=D/2, thus allowing<br>
for a more dense and space-efficient arrangement. Furthermore, the use of Rhodamine<br>
instead of a flow meter allows eliminating the additional segment AS of the CFL,<br>
yielding a desalination system of dimensions 1 
Those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains will readily appreciate<br>
that numerous changes, variations, and modification can be made without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention, mutatis mutandis.<br>
