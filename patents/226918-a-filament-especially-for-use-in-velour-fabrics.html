				<td>TITLE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to improvements in<br>
filament cross-sections, and is more particularly<br>
concerned with new polyester filaments having an<br>
improved scalloped-oval cross-section, and being such<br>
as is especially useful in velour fabrics, and to<br>
processes relating thereto and products therefrom, and<br>
having other advantages.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Yarns of synthetic fibers, such as polyester<br>
fibers, can generally be classified into two groups,<br>
namely (1) continuous filament yarns and (2) spun<br>
yarns, meaning yarns of fibers that are discontinuous,<br>
which latter fibers are often referred to as staple<br>
fibers (sometimes as cut fibers). Polyester staple<br>
fibers and such fibers of other synthetic; polymers are<br>
formed by extrusion of the synthetic polymer into<br>
continuous filaments, which are then converted into<br>
staple fibers. The terms "fiber" and "filament" are<br>
often used herein inclusively, without intending that<br>
use of one term should exclude the other.<br>
Velour fabrics can be produced by several<br>
processes, including knitting and weaving, but all have<br>
the characteristic that they comprise cut fibers that<br>
stand on end. The cut fibers are typically short, 0.06<br>
to 0.25 inches (1.5 to 7 mm) and are held upright from<br>
the backing fibers. Velours are frequently used in<br>
home upholstery, automotive upholstery and apparel<br>
applications.<br>
Automotive upholstery velours require increased<br>
performance and improved aesthetics. Performance<br>
criteria for velour fabrics include reduced propensity<br>
to crush while desired aesthetics include softer hand<br>
and no "fingermarking" or "mark-off". Improvements in<br><br>
all these fabric parameters typically require fiber<br>
properties that are difficult to include in one and the<br>
same fiber; in other words, improving desired<br>
performance may decrease desired aesthetics and vice<br>
versa.<br>
One means to vary the performance and aesthetic<br>
properties of the fabric is by varying fiber size. For<br>
example, a 1 denier-per-filament (dpf and approximately<br>
corresponding to 1 dtex) round polyester filament fiber<br>
can be used to make an automotive velour fabric to<br>
provide a very soft hand. However, the fingermarking<br>
aesthetics and crush performance of such a fabric have<br>
been unacceptable. Conversely, a 5 dpf (about 5.5<br>
dtex) round polyester filament can be used to make an<br>
automotive velour with very good crush performance and<br>
fingermarking aesthetics, but has had unacceptable<br>
hand. As a result, the industry standard has been 2.2<br>
to 3 dpf (2.4 to 3.3 dtex) round filaments; these,<br>
however, have provided neither adequate fabric<br>
performance nor desired aesthetics. Other common fiber<br>
cross-sections such as octalobal (U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,041,689) and triangular (trilobal, U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,698,177) have provided only limited improvements.<br>
According to this invention, and described and<br>
illustrated hereinafter, I provide a synthetic<br>
polymeric filament, especially a polyester filament,<br>
that improves the performance characteristics of velour<br>
fabrics, namely reduced crushing propensity, while also<br>
improving the aesthetics of such velour fabrics, namely<br>
reduced fingermarking and softer hand.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there<br>
is provided a filament having a scalloped-oval<br>
peripheral cross-section that is of aspect ratio (A:B)<br>
about 3:1 to 1.1:1, B being maximum width and A being<br>
measured along major axis of the scalloped-oval<br>
peripheral cross-section, and having 8 grooves<br><br><br>
extending along the filament, 4 of said 8 grooves being<br>
located on each side of the major axis, wherein 4 of<br>
said 8 grooves are located towards ends of the major<br>
axis and are referred to herein as outer grooves,<br>
wherein a pair of said outer grooves that are located<br>
at the same end of the major axis define between them a<br>
lobe at the same end of the major axis and are<br>
separated from each other by a minimum distance between<br>
said pair of d1, the width of the cross-section as<br>
measured at the lobe being b1, wherein remaining 4 of<br>
said 8 grooves that are not outer grooves are referred<br>
to herein as inner grooves, each of said inner grooves<br>
being located between one of said outer grooves and<br>
location of said maximum width, wherein pairs of said<br>
inner grooves that are separated from each other by the<br>
major axis are separated by a minimum distance between<br>
them of d2, wherein 4 outer bulges in the scalloped-<br>
oval peripheral cross-section are defined by being<br>
between one of said outer grooves and one of said inner<br>
grooves, the width of the cross-section as measured at<br>
such outer bulges being b2, wherein inner bulges in the<br>
scalloped-oval peripheral cross-section between 2 of<br>
said inner grooves on a side of the major axis provide<br>
the location for said maximum width B, and wherein the<br>
numerical relationships between the widths B, b1 and b2<br>
and the distances d1 and d2 are as follows: d1/b1 is<br>
about 0.5 to about 1; d2/b2 is about 0.5 to about 0.9;<br>
d2/B is about 0.3 to about 0.7; b1/b2 is about 0.25 to<br>
about 0.9; and b2/B is about 0.5 to about 0.9. This<br>
improved cross-sectional configuration with 8 grooves<br>
is often referred to herein as "scalloped-oval" and as<br>
8-grooved or as "octachannel". As indicated, the term<br>
"filament" is used inclusively herein. The term is used<br>
to include both continuous filaments and cut fibers.<br>
The essence of the invention is in the new filament<br>
cross-section that has provided unexpected advantages,<br>
as will be described.<br><br><br>
This invention is primarily addressed to<br>
solving problems encountered in providing polyester<br>
fibers for velour fabrics, as already indicated.<br>
However, the advantages of the unique cross-sectional<br>
configuration of my new filaments may well also be<br>
adaptable to other synthetic filaments, e.g., of<br>
polyamides or polyolefins, by way of example, and to<br>
other applications.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention,<br>
downstream products, such as fabrics and garments, are<br>
also provided.<br>
According to further aspects of the invention,<br>
there are provided processes for preparing the new<br>
filaments and other products.<br>
According to the present invention a filament especially for use in velour<br>
fabrics of improved crush performance having a scalloped-oval peripheral<br>
cross-section that is of aspect ratio (A:B) 3:1 to 1.1:1, B being maximum<br>
width and A being measured along major axis of the scalloped-oval peripheral<br>
cross-section, and having 8 grooves extending along the filament, 4 of said 8<br>
grooves being located on each side of the major axis, wherein 4 of said 8<br>
grooves are located towards ends of the major axis and are referred to herein<br>
as outer grooves, wherein a pair of said outer grooves that are located at the<br>
same end of the major axis define between them a lobe at the same end of the<br>
major axis and are separated from each other by a minimum distance<br>
between said pair of d1, the width of the cross-section as measured at the lobe<br>
being b1, wherein remaining 4 of said 8 grooves that are not outer grooves are<br>
referred to herein as inner grooves, each of said inner grooves being located<br>
between one of said outer grooves and location of said maximum width,<br>
wherein pairs of said inner grooves that are separated from each other by the<br>
major axis are separated by a minimum distance between them of d2,<br>
wherein 4 outer bulges in the scalloped- oval peripheral cross-section are<br>
defined by being between one of said outer grooves and one of said inner<br>
grooves the width of the cross-section as measured at such outer bulges<br>
being b2, wherein inner bulges in the scalloped-oval peripheral cross-section<br>
between 2 of said inner grooves on a side of the major axis provide the<br>
location for said maximum width B, and wherein the numerical relationships<br>
between the widths B, b1 and b2 and the distances d1 and d2 are as follows:<br>
d1/b1 is 0.5 to 1; d2/b2 is 0.5 to 0.9; d2/B is 0.3 to 0.7; bl/b2 is 0.25 to 0.9;<br>
and b2/B is 0.5 to 0.9.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
As indicated, the essence of my invention is in<br>
the new filament cross-section, so this will be<br>
primarily addressed.<br>
The cross-sections of the polyester filaments<br>
according to my invention should not be round but<br>
scalloped-oval, i.e., generally oval" in shape with<br>
scallops (i.e., with indentations) in the generally<br>
oval periphery so as to provide 8 grooves (channels)<br>
that run along the length of the filaments. Twenty<br><br><br>
years ago, a polyester filament of scalloped-oval<br>
cross-section was disclosed by Gorrafa in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 3,914,488, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference, as is the<br>
disclosure of Franklin U.S. Patent No. 4,634,625 and<br>
Clark et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,707,407 which disclose<br>
filaments of similar scalloped-oval cross-section for<br>
use in continuous filament yarns and staple. Also,<br>
Aneja has filed copending applications Nos. 08/662,804<br>
(DP-6400) on June 12, 1996, 08/497,495 (DP-6255) on<br>
June 30, 1995, and shortly to issue as U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,591,523, and 08/642,650 (DP-6365-A) on May 3, 1996,<br>
now allowed, the disclosures of which are also<br>
incorporated herein by reference. My 8-grooved<br>
scalloped-oval cross-section is clearly different from<br>
the 4-grocved and 6-grooved scalloped-oval cross-<br>
sections disclosed by Gorrafa, Franklin, Clark et al.,<br>
and Aneja. My filaments provide advantages over those<br>
filaments having different scalloped-oval cross-<br>
sections, which are surprising.<br>
The essence of the present invention is the<br>
cross-sectional shape or configuration of my new<br>
filaments that results mainly from selection of<br>
appropriately-shaped polymer extrusion orifices, as<br>
discussed in the art, although other factors, such as<br>
the polymer viscosity and the spinning conditions, also<br>
affect the shape of the filaments. This will now be<br>
discussed with reference to the accompanying Drawings.<br>
The cross-sectional configuration of filaments<br>
according to the invention may be seen in Figure 1<br>
which is a photomicrograph (2000X) showing actual<br>
filament cross-sections as prepared in the Example.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of a<br>
typical octachannel cross-section for ease of<br>
discussing dimensions that are significant. The<br>
largest dimension A of the periphery of the fiber<br>
cross-section is shown extending along the major axis.<br>
The maximum width (B) of the fiber cross-section<br><br>
extends at right angles to the major axis. The ratio<br>
of A to B is referred to as the aspect ratio (A/B).<br>
This aspect ratio should generally be up to about 3:1,<br>
and at least about 1.1:1 (corresponding to a B/A ratio<br>
of about 0.35 to about 0.9); a preferred aspect ratio<br>
has been found to be about 2:1. As can be seen, the<br>
cross-section has a generally oval periphery that is<br>
indented and is to this extent somewhat similar to the<br>
prior scalloped-oval cross-sections disclosed by<br>
Gorrafa and others. Unlike Gorrafa's 4-groove<br>
scalloped-oval, however, this periphery has eight (8)<br>
indentations (which correspond with 8 channels, or<br>
grooves, that extend along the filament length). Four<br>
(4) grooves (indentations) are located on either side<br>
of the cross-section, i.e., on each side of the major<br>
axis. Four (4) of the eight grooves (indentations) are<br>
referred to as "outer" grooves (indentations) as they<br>
are located towards the ends of the major axis, so a<br>
pair of these outer grooves is located, one on either<br>
side of, near each end and this pair defines a lobe at<br>
each end. This lobe is of width b1, measured generally<br>
at right angles to the major axis. Such a pair of<br>
outer grooves at the same end of the major axis is<br>
separated one from the other by a distance d1, also<br>
shown as being in a direction at right angles to the<br>
major axis because the grooves are shown symmetrically<br>
located. It will be understood that if the<br>
indentations are not opposite one another the<br>
separation distance d1 will not be precisely<br>
perpendicular to the major axis. The remaining grooves<br>
on either side of the major axis are located between<br>
these outer grooves and are referred to accordingly as<br>
"inner" grooves (indentations). Between grooves (in the<br>
generally oval (i.e., generally convexly-curved)<br>
periphery that are adjacent along a side of the cross-<br>
section) are what are referred to herein as "bulges";<br>
these may be considered somewhat similar to what<br>
Gorrafa referred to as his lobes that he located on<br><br>
each extremity of his minor axis, but are probably more<br>
correctly termed bulges than lobes. Because preferred<br>
filaments of the present invention are octachannel<br>
filaments, whose cross-sections have eight (8) grooves,<br>
in contrast to Gorrafa's four (4), my cross-sections<br>
have four (4) grooves on either side and three (3)<br>
bulges on either side; for convenience, these three<br>
bulges on either side are referred to as "outer bulges"<br>
and "inner bulges", the latter being the middle of each<br>
set of 3 bulges on either side and being between both<br>
of the inner grooves on the same side, whereas each<br>
"outer bulge" is between an outer groove and its<br>
nearest inner groove on the same side. The width of<br>
the filament cross-section at the outer bulges is<br>
designated b2 (corresponding to the width of a lobe,<br>
namely b1) and a pair of inner grooves is separated<br>
from each other (across the major axis) by d2<br>
(corresponding to the separation between a pair of<br>
outer grooves by distance d1) . As will be understood,<br>
the maximum width at the bulges is B, namely the<br>
maximum width of the filament cross-section, generally<br>
being the width of the inner bulges.<br>
The numerical relationships of the foregoing<br>
parameters should be approximately as follows:<br><br>
Various alternative octachannel cross-sections<br>
can be envisaged for filaments of this invention.<br>
Although the cross-section shown schematically in<br>
Figure 2 is more or less symmetrical, and this is<br>
preferred for some embodiments, it is not essential.<br>
For instance, the indentations need not be<br><br>
staple, and resulting staple). Similarly, fabric<br>
samples were made as a woven velour (although a knit<br>
velour would also be acceptable for the invention)<br>
through standard fabric-forming techniques. The draw-<br>
textured yarn deniers were the same (150 denier,<br>
equivalent to 167 dtex) so that fabric weights were<br>
equivalent. The individual deniers-per-filament (dpf)<br>
were, however different, as they were adjusted to<br>
obtain optimum balance of the competing fabric<br>
properties for each filament cross-section.<br>
The fabrics were subjectively rated for hand<br>
(softness), fingermarking, and crush resistance. The<br>
rating for hand was on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the<br>
best and 1 being the worst; as a frame of reference, a<br>
fabric made with 1 denier-per-filament (dpf<br>
corresponding to 1.1 dtex) fiber with a round cross<br>
section was rated a 5 and a fabric made with a 5 dpf<br>
(5.5 dtex) round fiber was rated a 1. The rating for<br>
fingermarking was on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 having little<br>
or no fingermarking, 3 having acceptable fingermarking,<br>
and 1 having terrible fingermarking. The crush<br>
resistance ratings were based on a standard accelerated<br>
crush test known as the Rolling Sphere. This test<br>
subjects the fabric to repetitive mechanical stroking<br>
with a steel ball. The fabrics are then rated on a<br>
scale of 1 to 5, 5 having little or no crush mark<br>
showing, 3 having acceptable crush appearance, and 1<br>
having terrible crush marking. Samples are rated<br>
typically by five people and the ratings reported as<br>
the average of the five scores.<br>
Example<br>
Filaments of poly(ethylene terephthalate) were<br>
melt-spun at 295°C from polymer having a relative<br>
viscosity (LRV of 21 and titanium dioxide (TiO2)<br>
content of 1.5% as a delusterant. The polymer was<br>
extruded at a rate of 11.1 pounds (5.0 Kg) per hour<br><br><br>
through spinnerets having the numbers of capillaries<br>
and cross-sections as shown in Table 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows the capillary orifice used to<br>
produce the octachannel scalloped-oval filaments of the<br>
present invention. As shown in Figure 3, the capillary<br>
for the octachannel fiber consisted of five diamonds<br>
joined by slots to obtain a well-defined filament<br>
shape, good spinning performance and low fiber<br>
fibrillation propensity. The widths (H) of the small,<br>
medium, and large diamond-shaped apertures were 13.6<br>
mil (345 ) , 24 mil (610 ) , and 35.8 mil (909 ) ,<br>
respectively. The small, medium, and large diamond<br>
included angles were 60°, 40°, and 26°, respectively.<br>
All five diamonds were located in a straight row. The<br>
overall length of the orifice along the row was 52.6<br>
mil (133 6 ) . The lengths measured along the row (as<br>
mentioned above) were, in order, 9.1 mil (231 ) , 11.2<br>
mil (284 ) , 12 mil (305 ) , 11.2 mil (284 ) , and 9.1<br>
mil (231 ) , respectively. The 4 slots between the<br>
diamond-shaped apertures were each of length 3.5 mil<br>
(89 ) and width (h) 2.6 mil (66 () . The capillary<br>
yielded a1/A1, a1/A2, a2/A2, and a2/A3 flow area ratios<br>
of 0.11, 0.05, 0.08, and 0.06, respectively. The<br>
ratios h/H1, h/H2, and h/H3 were 0.19, 0.11, and 0.07,<br>
respectively. Filaments produced from the 50 hole<br>
spinneret in Figure 3 of the present invention were<br>
wound at 3131 meters per minute (mpm) after being<br>
quenched using standard POY cross flow quench. The<br>
bundle of filaments of the invention wound-up was 255<br>
denier (283 dtex) and had a draw tension of<br>
approximately 93 gpd (grams per denier, about 84<br>
g/dtex). The filaments had octachannel cross-sections<br>
(as shown in Figure 1) with the following parameters:<br><br><br><br>
Winding speeds (mpm) and draw tensions (gpd)<br>
are given for all the cross-sections in Table 1. Each<br>
end was subsequently draw-false-twist textured (drawn<br>
dpfs being also given in Table 1), package dyed, air<br>
jet entangled, woven into a woven velour fabric, and<br>
finished using standard fabric finishing techniques.<br>
The fabric samples were rated for hand, fingermarking,<br>
and crush resistance (as described above). The results<br>
of the ratings are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
The octachannel cross-sect ion of the invention<br>
provided the best combination of hand, fingermarking,<br>
and crush resistance versus the other cross-sections,<br>
demonstrating that the filaments of the invention<br>
provided a superior combination of properties that are<br>
desired in such velour fabrics. It is believed that<br>
the novel octachannel cross-section will also show<br>
advantages in other applications, e.g., as disclosed by<br>
Aneja in his applications referred to hereinabove, such<br>
as tows and slivers for worsted and woollen processing.<br><br><br>

outer grooves and location of said maximum width, wherein pairs of said<br>
inner grooves that are separated from each other by the major axis are<br>
separated by a minimum distance between them of d2, wherein 4 outer<br>
bulges in the scalloped- oval peripheral cross-section are defined by being<br>
between one of said outer grooves and one of said inner grooves the width of<br>
the cross-section as measured at such outer bulges being b2, wherein inner<br>
bulges in the scalloped-oval peripheral cross-section between 2 of said inner<br>
grooves on a side of the major axis provide the location for said maximum<br>
width B, and wherein the numerical relationships between the widths B, b1<br>
and b2 and the distances d1 and d2 are as follows: d1/b1 is 0.5 to 1; d2/b2 is<br>
0.5 to 0.9; d2/B is 0.3 to 0.7; bl/b2 is 0.25 to 0.9; and b2/B is 0.5 to 0.9.<br>
