TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing fermented milk using<br>
novel lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus, and fermented milk<br>
prepared in accordance with the production method.<br>
 Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-032646, filed on<br>
February 13, 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium (hereinafter, abbreviated to<br>
"Bifidobacterium"), such as Bifidobacterium longum, is one of predominant bacterial<br>
strains in intestinal microflora formed in the human intestinal tract. It is known that<br>
Bifidobacterium have an intestinal function-regulating activity, an immuno-stimulating<br>
activity, and an anti-cancer activity. Accordingly, demands for food products containing<br>
viable Bifidobacterium such as milk fermented with Bifidobacterium or the like are<br>
increasing in accordance with an increase of health consciousness of consumers.<br>
[0003]<br>
Bifidobacterium exhibits a poor proliferation potency in a milk medium.<br>
Accordingly, various growth-stimulating substances are generally formulated in<br>
fermented milk so that the Bifidobacterium is contained therein at a constant content, for<br>
example, 1x107 CFU/ml. However, the growth-stimulating substances are generally<br>
expensive and may degrade the taste. In addition, preservation of Bifidobacterium<br>
under acidic conditions is difficult and tends to result in death of Bifidobacterium. Thus,<br><br>
the viable count of the Bifidobacterium in fermented milk products decreases with<br>
accelerating speed during the course of distribution of the fermented milk products.<br>
Accordingly, it is expected that a promotion of the growth of Bifidobacterium or<br>
an improvement of the survivability thereof during storage enables not only preparation<br>
of fermented milk containing a large amount of viable Bifidobacterium, but also<br>
preparation of fermented milk which can keep an abundant amount of viable<br>
Bifidobacterium from immediately after preparation until being consumed.<br>
[0004]<br>
Various methods for promoting the growth of Bifidobacterium or improving the<br>
survivability thereof during storage by fermentation with Bifidobacterium and another<br>
lactic acid bacterium without adding any growth-stimulating substances or the like have<br>
been disclosed. For example, (1) yogurt containing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis,<br>
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Bifidobacterium, and a method for preparing the<br>
yogurt have been disclosed (see, for example, Patent Document 1), with respect to a<br>
method for promoting the growth of Bifidobacterium to prepare fermented milk.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, (2) a method for fermenting milk with Bifidobacterium, including<br>
cultivating Bifidobacterium breve together with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, which<br>
forms neither diacetyl nor acetoin, in a medium containing milk as the main component<br>
thereof has been disclosed (see, for example, Patent Document 2), with respect to a<br>
method for improving the survivability of Bifidobacterium during storage of fermented<br>
milk.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. 3,364,491.<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Publication No. 3,068,484.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0006]<br>
Although the growth of Bifidobacterium is promoted and the fermentation time<br><br>
is shortened in accordance with the above-mentioned method (1), there is no disclosure<br>
with respect to the survivability of Bifidobacterium during storage in Patent Document 1.<br>
In contrast, although both growth-stimulating effects and survivability-improving effects<br>
are recognized by using a mixture composed of a specific Bifidobacterium and a specific<br>
lactic acid bacterium in accordance with the above-mentioned method (2), there is no<br>
disclosure with respect to Bifidobacterium other than Bifidobacterium breve, such as<br>
Bifidobacterium longum, which is generally formulated in food products.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention has for an object thereof the provision of a method for<br>
producing fermented milk using lactic acid bacteria which stimulate the growth of<br>
Bifidobacterium and improve the survivability thereof during storage, and fermented<br>
milk prepared in accordance with the production method.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0008]<br>
The inventors of the present invention intensively investigated so as to solve the<br>
above-mentioned problems, and performed a fermentation test by performing<br>
co-cultivation with Bifidobacterium longum to find out lactic acid bacterial strains which<br>
exhibit excellent fermentability in 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium. As a<br>
result, the inventors found lactic acid bacterium strains which can promote the growth of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum to a viable count of 5×108 CFU/g when pH is 4.4 to 4.6, and<br>
enhance the survival rate of Bifidobacterium longum to 30% or more when stored at<br>
10°C for two weeks after the fermentation is ended and then immediately rapid cooling is<br>
performed. In addition, the present inventors found that fermented milk containing a<br>
great amount of Bifidobacterium and having an excellent survivability during storage can<br>
be produced by using the lactic acid bacteria, and thus the present invention has been<br>
completed.<br>
[0009]<br>
That is, the present invention provides a method for producing fermented milk<br><br>
including: performing fermentation using, as lactic acid bacteria, both bacteria belonging<br>
to the genus Bifidobacterium and bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus having the<br>
following bacteriological properties:<br>
(1)	fermentability which curdles a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium<br>
when cultivated at a temperature of 25°C to 37°C for 16 hours;<br>
(2)	Bifidobacterium longum growth-promoting properties which lead to a viable<br>
count of Bifidobacterium longum of 5×108 CFU/g or more, when co-cultivated with<br>
Bifidobacterium longum in the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium until the pH<br>
thereof is 4.4 to 4.6; and<br>
(3)	Bifidobacterium longum survivability-improving properties during storage,<br>
which lead to a survival rate of Bifidobacterium longum of 30% or more, after<br>
co-cultivation with Bifidobacterium longum in the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk<br>
medium until the pH thereof is 4.4 to 4.6, rapid cooling, and two weeks storage at 10°C.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus have no ability to<br>
ferment xylose and produce neither diacetyl nor acetoin.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus are Lactococcus<br>
lactis subsp. lactis.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus include at least one<br>
bacterial strain selected from the group consisting of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC852 (FERM BP-10742), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857 (FERM<br>
BP-10757), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC859 (FERM BP-10744), Lactococcus<br>
lactis subsp. lactis MCC865 (FERM BP-10745), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC866 (FERM BP-10746).<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that the bacteria belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium are<br>
Bifidobacterium longum.<br><br>
15707, and the like. Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 is particularly preferable,<br>
since Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 exhibits excellent fermentability in a milk<br>
medium, excellent acid-resistance during the course of distribution, and excellent gastric<br>
acid-resistance. Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 was accepted by the<br>
International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial<br>
Science and Technology, (Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken,<br>
JAPAN (postal code number: 305-8566)) on October 31, 2001.<br>
[0013]<br>
The bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present<br>
invention have the properties (1), (2), and (3).<br>
The property (1) relates to fermentability. If a lactic acid bacteria can rapidly<br>
proliferate and have a strong fermentability sufficient to curdle a 10% (W/W)<br>
reconstituted skim milk medium when cultivated therein at a temperature between 25°C<br>
and 37°C for 16 hours, the lactic acid bacteria can effectively promote the growth of<br>
Bifidobacterium, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, at the time of preparing fermented<br>
milk. As used herein, the phrase "curdle a culture medium" refers to a phenomenon in<br>
which the pH of the culture medium decreases below an isoelectric point of a milk<br>
protein thereof by acid fermentation, and thereby the milk protein agglomerates and the<br>
culture medium is curdled. The "10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium" may be<br>
prepared, for example, by dissolving 10% by mass of skim milk powders (manufactured<br>
by Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd., for example) in water.<br>
[0014]<br>
Although the temperature range suitable for fermentation with bacteria<br>
belonging to the genus Lactococcus is generally between 20°C and 30°C, the bacteria<br>
belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present invention exhibit a strong<br>
fermentability at a temperature between 25°C and 37°C. In other words, the bacteria<br>
belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present invention exhibit a<br>
sufficient fermentability within a temperature range suitable for fermentation with<br>
Bifidobacterium, particularly with Bifidobacterium longum (30°C to 40°C).<br><br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that a bacterial strain of the Bifidobacterium longum is Bifidobacterium<br>
longum FERM BP-7787.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that both Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus are<br>
further used as the lactic acid bacteria.<br>
The present invention also provides fermented milk prepared by any of the<br>
above-mentioned method for producing fermented milk.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0010]<br>
In accordance with the method for producing fermented milk according to the<br>
present invention, fermented milk containing a great amount of Bifidobacterium,<br>
particularly Bifidobacterium longum can be efficiently produced as never before. In<br>
addition, the fermented milk according to the present invention maintains a sufficient<br>
viable count of Bifidobacterium, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, even during the<br>
course of distribution, and therefore the fermented milk exhibit further high intestinal<br>
function-regulating effects and is useful for health control.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing fermented milk,<br>
characterized in that milk is fermented with both Bifidobacterium and bacteria belonging<br>
to the genus Lactococcus having the above-mentioned properties (1), (2), and (3). In<br>
particular, the method is suitable for production of fermented milk by fermenting milk<br>
using Bifidobacterium longum.<br>
[0012]<br>
Examples of Bifidobacterium longum available in the present invention include<br>
Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787, Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC<br><br>
The property (2) relates 'to Bifidobacterium longum growth-promoting properties.<br>
A milk medium such as a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium exhibits excellent<br>
taste, mouth-feeling, and external appearance, when the pH thereof reaches<br>
approximately 4.6, casein and other components contained therein are generally<br>
precipitated, and the culture medium is wholly curdled. Accordingly, fermentation is<br>
generally stopped by rapid cooling or the like when the pH reaches approximately 4.6, to<br>
prepare fermented milk products. Therefore, the lactic acid bacteria having the<br>
growth-promoting properties that can lead the viable count of Bifidobacterium longum<br>
being a high count of 5&gt;
longum in the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium until pH thereof is 4.4 to 4.6<br>
can effectively increase the viable count of Bifidobacterium, particularly Bifidobacterium<br>
longum, in fermented milk at the time of preparation of fermented milk.<br>
[0016]<br>
The property (3) relates to Bifidobacterium longum survivability-improving<br>
properties during storage. The quality preservation time period of fermented milk<br>
products is generally about two weeks when stored at 10°C or lower. Accordingly,<br>
fermented milk which maintains a sufficient viable count of Bifidobacterium, particularly<br>
Bifidobacterium longum, even at the end of the time period by which the quality<br>
preservation thereof is ensured, can be produced, provided that the lactic acid bacteria<br>
having the survivability-improving properties during storage that can lead to a survival<br>
rate of Bifidobacterium longum being 30% or more after co-cultivation with<br>
Bifidobacterium longum in the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium until the pH<br>
thereof is 4.4 to 4.6, rapid cooling, and two weeks storage at 10°C.<br>
[0017]<br>
The bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present<br>
invention may be prepared in accordance with the following method, for example. First,<br>
bacterial strains are isolated from various samples, and strains which exhibit excellent<br>
fermentability in the 10%'(W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium, more specifically<br><br>
fermentability sufficient to curdle the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium when<br>
cultivated therein at a temperature of 25 to 37°C for 16 hours, are selected from the<br>
isolated bacterial strains. Then, the selected bacterial strains are co-cultivated with<br>
Bifidobacterium longum, and bacterial strains which have Bifidobacterium longum<br>
growth-promoting properties and Bifidobacterium longum survivability-improving<br>
properties during storage defined as the above-mentioned properties (2) and (3) are<br>
selected. It is further preferable that bacterial strains which do not have an ability to<br>
ferment xylose and produce neither diacetyl nor acetoin be selected.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the following, the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
1.	Isolation of bacterial strains<br>
In order to isolate bacterial strains having the above-mentioned properties from<br>
the natural world, the present inventors collected samples from the natural world in Japan,<br>
diluted the samples with an anaerobic dilution buffer ("The World of Enterobacteria"<br>
published by Soubunsha Co., Ltd., written by Tomotari Mitsuoka, Page 322, 1980:<br>
hereinafter, abbreviated to "Reference 1"), inoculated the diluted samples on each plate<br>
of Briggs liver broth (see the above-mentioned Reference 1, Page 319), and then cultured<br>
the inoculated samples at 30°C under anaerobic conditions. Among the thus obtained<br>
colonies, bacterial strains which showed morphological characteristics of streptococcal<br>
bacteria and were recognized as Gram-positive bacteria by microscopic observation of<br>
applied specimens were picked up. The picked up strains were each streak-inoculated<br>
on each BL agar flat plate and then repeatedly cultivated under anaerobic conditions in<br>
the same manner as described above to obtain purely isolated bacterial strains. The<br>
isolated bacterial strains were subjected to a fermentation test on a 10% (W/W)<br>
reconstituted skim milk medium as described below to obtain 20 bacterial strains with<br>
fermentability defined as the above-mentioned property (1). Then, the obtained<br>
bacterial strains were co-cultured with Bifidobacterium longum to obtain 5 bacterial<br>
strains having both the growth-promoting properties which raise the viable count of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum at a pH of 4.4 to 4.6 to 5×108 CFU/g or more and the<br><br>
survivability-improving properties during storage which raise the survival rate of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum to 30% or more when stored at 10°C for two weeks after rapid<br>
cooling at a pH of 4.4 to 4.6. The 5 bacterial strains are named as "MCC852",<br>
"MCC857", "MCC859", "MCC865", and "MCC866", respectively.<br>
[0019]<br>
2.	Bacteriological properties<br>
The bacteriological properties of the 5 bacterial strains will be shown in the<br>
following. The tests for determining the bacteriological properties were performed with<br>
reference to Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, edited by Peter H. A. Sneath,<br>
Vol. 2, published by Williams and Wilkins Company, 1986).<br>
[0020]<br>
(I)	Bacterial morphology (observed through an optical microscope after anaerobic<br>
cultivation on a BL agar flat plate at 30°C for 72 hours)<br>
Size: 1 to 2 µm (diameter)<br>
Morphology: Streptococcal bacteria<br>
(II)	Gram staining: Positive<br>
(III)	Litmus milk: Curdled<br>
(IV)	Endospore formation: Negative<br>
(V)	Gas production from glucose: Negative<br>
(VI)	Motility: Negative<br>
(VII)	Catalase activity: Negative<br>
(VIII)	Arginine decarboxylase test: Positive<br>
(IX)	Gas production from citric acid: Negative<br>
(X)	Temperature susceptibility (at 60°C for 30 minutes and at 65°C for 30 minutes):<br>
Positive in both cases<br>
(XI)	Glucose degradation product: L-lactic acid<br>
[0021]<br><br><br><br>
[0022]<br>
The above-mentioned bacteriological properties (I) to (XI) are common to all of<br>
the 5 bacterial strains and the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain ATCC 19435.<br>
The growth temperature (XII), the salt-resistance (XIII), the pH-resistance (XIV), the<br>
methylene blue-resistance (XV), the producibility of ammonia from arginine (XVI), and<br>
the sugar fermentability (XVII) of each strain are shown in Table 1. The sugar<br>
fermentation was examined with respect to 28 kinds of sugar using a medium for sugar<br>
fermentation disclosed by Mitsuoka (Tomotari Mitsuoka, "The bacteriology of lactic acid<br>
bacteria", Clinical Examination 18, Pages 1163 to 1172, 1974).<br>
[0023]<br>
It is apparent from the above-mentioned results that all of the 5 bacterial strains<br>
have the bacteriological properties common to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bacterial<br>
strains. Thus, the 5 bacterial strains have been recognized to be bacterial strains<br>
belonging to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. On the other hand, it is apparent from the<br>
above-mentioned bacteriological properties (XII) to (XVII) that the 5 bacterial strains are<br>
different from the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain in that the 5 bacterial<br>
strains do not have any abilities to ferment xylose.<br>
[0024]<br>
The 5 bacterial strains were deposited by the applicant at the International Patent<br>
Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology,<br>
(Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, JAPAN (postal code number:<br>
305-8566)) as novel bacterial strains. The accession number of the Lactococcus lactis<br>
subsp. lactis MCC852 is FERM BP-10742, that of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC857 is FERM BP-10757, that of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC859 is<br>
FERM BP-10744, that of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC865 is FERM<br>
BP-10745, and that of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC866 is FERM BP-10746.<br>
The Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC852, 859, 865, and 866 were deposited on<br>
December 1, 2006, and the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857 was deposited on<br>
January 10,2007.<br><br>
[0025]	<br>
3.	Test with respect to fermentability on 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk<br>
medium.<br>
Each 3% (V/V) bacterial strain starter was inoculated into a 10% (W/W)<br>
reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized at 95°C for 30 minutes, and then cultured at<br>
25, 30, or 37°C for 16 hours. After the obtained culture medium was rapidly cooled, the<br>
curdled state was observed, and the pH and the viable count of the contained lactic acid<br>
bacteria were measured. The viable count was measured using commercially available<br>
BCP plate count agar (manufactured by Eiken Chemical Co., LTD.) flat plates. The<br>
measurement results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain ATCC 19435 disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 2 was used as a control strain.<br>
[0026]<br><br>
When each bacterial strain of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC852, 857,<br>
859, 865, and 866, that is, the bacteria of the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present<br>
invention, was used, the pH of the culture medium was decreased to between 4.4 and 4.6<br>
under any temperature conditions, and the culture medium was curdled. In addition, the<br>
viable count of the contained lactic acid bacteria was approximately 1×109 CFU/g, and<br>
thus the favorable proliferation and fermentability conditions were recognized.<br>
On the other hand, when the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain ATCC<br><br>
19435 was used, the pH of the culture medium was 5.5 or more and the culture medium<br>
was not curdled under any temperature conditions. In addition, the viable count of the<br>
lactic acid bacteria was significantly less at 30°C or higher, than that particularly of the<br>
bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus according to the present invention.<br>
[0028]<br>
4.	Co-cultivation test with Bifidobacterium longum<br>
(1)	Co-cultivation test with Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787.<br>
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain ATCC 19435 was used as a control<br>
strain.<br>
First, each culture of the 5 bacterial strains (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC852, 857, 859, 865, and 866) and Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 was<br>
prepared in accordance with the method described in the following Example 1.<br>
In addition, 1,000 mL of a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium<br>
containing 0.2% (W/W) yeast'extract (manufactured by Difco) was sterilized at 90°C for<br>
30 minutes. Then, 30 mL of a culture of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain<br>
ATCC 19435 was inoculated into the reconstituted skim milk medium, and cultivated at<br>
30°C for 16 hours to prepare a culture of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis-type strain<br>
ATCC 19435.<br>
[0029]<br>
1% (V/V) of each culture of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains prepared<br>
as above was inoculated with 1% (V/V) of the culture of the Bifidobacterium longum<br>
FERM BP-7787 into a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized at 90°C<br>
for 10 minutes, and the mixture were cultivated at 37°C for 16 hours to obtain fermented<br>
milk. The fermented milk was rapidly cooled, and the pH thereof and the viable count<br>
of the contained Bifidobacterium were measured. Then, the resultant was further stored<br>
at 10°C for two weeks, and the viable counts of the Bifidobacterium was measured at one<br>
week and two weeks after initiation of storage. The viable count of the Bifidobacterium<br>
was measured using TOS propionate agar (manufactured by YAKULT<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY CO., LTD.) flat plates. The measurement results<br><br>
are shown in Table 3.<br>
[0030]<br><br>
[0031]<br>
Each fermented milk prepared by using the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC852, 857, 859, 865, or 866 had a pH of approximately 4.5 and a Bifidobacterium<br>
viable count of 5&gt;
was stored at 10°C for two weeks, the survival rate of Bifidobacterium longum was 80%<br>
or more.<br>
On the other hand, fermentation of milk did not proceed with the Lactococcus<br>
lactis subsp. lactis-type strain ATCC 19435, and the pH of the fermented milk was 5.0 or<br>
more and storage thereof at 10°C was impossible. In addition, the Bifidobacterium<br>
viable count immediately after the end of fermentation was approximately 1×108 CFU/g,<br>
which was significantly small in comparison with the case where the bacteria belonging<br>
to the genus Lactococcus according to the present invention were used.<br>
[0032]<br>
Thus, it is apparent that the 5 bacterial strains (the Lactococcus lactis subsp.<br>
lactis MCC852, 857, 859, 865, and 866) are superior to other known bacterial strains of<br>
the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in terms of the properties promoting the growth of<br><br>
Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 and the properties improving the survivability<br>
thereof during storage.<br>
It is also apparent that in the case where Bifidobacterium longum is co-cultured<br>
with the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis that forms neither diacetyl nor acetoin as<br>
described in Patent Document 2 is unlike the case where Bifidobacterium breve is used,<br>
and neither the Bifidobacterium-proliferation promoting effects nor<br>
Bifidobacterium-survivability improving effects disclosed in Patent Document 2 are<br>
exhibited.<br>
[0033]<br>
(2) Co-cultivation test with Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707<br>
The Bifidobacterium longum growth-promoting properties of the bacteria<br>
belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present invention and<br>
Bifidobacterium longum survivability-improving properties thereof during storage were<br>
checked using the Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 and the Bifidobacterium<br>
longum-type strain ATCC 15707.<br>
First, a culture of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857 and a culture of<br>
the Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 were prepared in accordance with the<br>
method described in the following Example 1.<br>
In addition, a mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus<br>
bulgaricus was prepared in accordance with the method described in the following<br>
Example 2.<br>
In addition, an 11% (W/W) skim milk medium containing 0.2% (W/W) yeast<br>
extract was sterilized at 90°C for 30 minutes. Then, 10% (V/V) of the Bifidobacterium<br>
longum-type strain ATCC 15707 was inoculated as a starter into the skim milk medium,<br>
and cultivated at 37°C until the pH reached 4.6 to prepare a culture of the<br>
Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707.<br>
[0034]<br>
1% (V/V) of the culture of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857<br>
prepared as described above, either 1% (V/V) of the culture of the Bifidobacterium<br><br>
longum FERM BP-7787 or 1% (V/V) of the culture of the Bifidobacterium longum-type<br>
strain ATCC 15707, and 0.01% (V/V) of the mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus<br>
and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were inoculated into a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk<br>
medium sterilized at 90°C for 10 minutes, and cultivated at 37°C until the pH reached 4.6<br>
to obtain fermented milk. After the obtained fermented milk was rapidly cooled, the<br>
viable count of Bifidobacterium was measured. In addition, the fermented milk was<br>
stored at 10°C for two weeks, and the viable count of Bifidobacterium longum was<br>
measured at one week and two weeks after initiation of storage.<br>
On the other hand, either 1.5% (V/V) of the culture of the Bifidobacterium<br>
longum FERM BP-7787 prepared as described above or 1.5% (V/V) of the culture of the<br>
Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707, and 0.4% (V/V) of the mixed culture<br>
of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were inoculated into a 10%<br>
(W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized at 90°C for 10 minutes, and cultivated<br>
at 37°C until the pH reached 4.6 to obtain fermented milk as a control. The viable<br>
Bifidobacterium count in the fermented milk was measured in the same manner. The<br>
measurement results are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0035]<br><br>
[0036]<br>
Both viable counts of the Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 and the<br>
Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707 in fermented milk were significantly<br>
increased by co-cultivating with the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857. In<br>
addition, the survival rate of every Bifidobacterium stored at 10°C for two weeks was<br><br>
30% or more: that of the Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 was 71% and that of<br>
the Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707 was 31%.<br>
In contrast, the survival rate of the Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787<br>
stored at 10°C for two weeks after cultivating in the absence of Lactococcus lactis subsp.<br>
lactis MCC857 was 20% and no viable Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707<br>
stored at 10°C for two weeks after cultivating in the absence of Lactococcus lactis subsp.<br>
lactis MCC857 was detected.<br>
The same results were obtained when every Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC852, 859, 865, and 866 was used instead of the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC857.<br>
[0037]<br>
Thus, it is apparent that every Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC852, 857,<br>
859, 865, and 866 also has excellent properties of both promoting the growth of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum strains other than Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787<br>
having an excellent survivability during storage and improving the survivability of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum strains other than Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787<br>
during storage.<br>
[0038]<br>
5.	Comparative test with mixture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and<br>
Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris disclosed in Patent Document 1.<br>
The culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857, the culture of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707, and the mixed culture of Streptococcus<br>
thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were prepared in accordance with the method<br>
described in the above 4(2).<br>
[0039]<br>
1% (V/V) of the culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857, 1% (V/V)<br>
of the culture of Bifidobacterium longum-type strain ATCC 15707, and 0.01% (V/V) of<br>
the mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, prepared<br>
in the above manner, were inoculated into a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium<br><br>
sterilized at 90°C for 10 minutes. The mixture was cultivated at 37°C until the pH<br>
reached 4.6 to prepare fermented milk. The fermented milk was rapidly cooled and the<br>
viable count of the contained Bifidobacterium was measured.<br>
In contrast. 1% (V/V) of the culture of Bifidobacterium longum-type strain<br>
ATCC 15707 prepared in the above-manner, and 2% (V/V) of a mixture "EZAL MA14"<br>
composed of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris<br>
(manufactured by Rhodia) were inoculated into a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk<br>
medium sterilized at 90°C for 10 minutes, as a control. The mixture was cultivated at<br>
38°C until the pH reached 4.6 to prepare fermented milk. The viable count of<br>
Bifidobacterium in the fermented milk was measured in the same manner. The mixture<br>
"EZAL MAI4" corresponds to a mixture "EZAL MR014" (manufactured by Rhodia)<br>
described in Patent Document 1.<br>
[0040]<br>
The viable Bifidobacterium count in fermented milk prepared using Lactococcus<br>
lactis subsp. lactis MCC857 was 5.5×10 CFU/g. In contrast, no viable<br>
Bifidobacterium cells were detected in a diluted solution obtained by diluting fermented<br>
milk prepared using the mixture "EZAL MA14" by 106 fold, and thus the viable<br>
Bifidobacterium count in the fermented milk was revealed to be 1 × 10 CFU/g or less.<br>
[0041]<br>
In other words, it was revealed that neither effects of promoting the growth of<br>
Bifidobacterium nor such effects of shortening fermentation time, as mentioned in Patent<br>
Document 1, were achieved when Bifidobacterium longum was co-cultivated with<br>
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris.<br>
[0042]lAs described above, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC852, 857, 859, 865,<br>
and 866 (the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be used in the present<br>
invention) exhibit strong fermentability in the milk medium at a temperature suitable to<br>
fermentation with Bifidobacterium, and also exhibit excellent effects of promoting the<br>
growth of Bifidobacterium land improving the survivability thereof during storage, when<br><br>
co-cultivated with Bifidobacterium longum. Thus, it is apparent that the bacteria have<br>
properties which are not accompanied with conventionally known bacterial strains<br>
belonging to the genus Lactococcus. In addition, it is expected that the bacteria to be<br>
used in the present invention can produce fermented products with favorable taste, since<br>
the bacteria produce neither diacetyl nor acetoin.<br>
[0043]<br>
Although a preculture medium used for cultivating Bifidobacterium and the<br>
bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus in advance is not particularly limited<br>
provided that the preculture medium is usually used, the preculture medium is preferably<br>
a milk medium. The preculture medium is more preferably a reconstituted skim milk<br>
medium, since the reconstituted skim milk medium can be easily handled. It is<br>
preferable that the concentration of the reconstituted skim milk medium be 3% (W/W) or<br>
more, and more preferably 8% (W/W) or more. In addition, the preculture medium may<br>
contain growth-stimulating substances such as yeast extract or reducing agents such as<br>
L-cysteine. It is particularly preferable that a growth-stimulating substance be<br>
formulated in the preculture medium, since Bifidobacterium exhibits a low level of<br>
proliferation in the milk medium. Specifically, a culture medium containing 0.1 to 1%<br>
(W/W) of yeast extract may be used. The preculture medium is subjected to<br>
sterilization for the use. The sterilization may be performed in accordance with a<br>
conventional method, specifically performed by heating at 80 to 122°C for 5 to 40<br>
minutes, preferably at 85 to 95°C for 5 to 35 minutes.<br>
[0044]<br>
The fermentation base medium to be used for fermentation with both<br>
Bifidobacterium and bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus is not particularly<br>
limited, provided that the fermentation base medium is usually used to produce<br>
fermented milk. The fermentation base medium may be prepared, for example, by<br>
formulating a sweetener such as sucrose, pectin, fruit, fruit juice, agar, gelatin, oil and fat,<br>
flavor, coloring agent, stabilizer, reducing agent, or the like, in cow's milk, skim milk,<br>
fresh cream, butter, whole milk powder, powdered skim milk, or the like, as needed,<br><br>
followed by sterilizing, homogenizing, cooling, and the like, in accordance with<br>
conventional methods.<br>
[0045]<br>
Although the inoculation ratio of Bifidobacterium to the bacteria belonging to<br>
the genus Lactococcus, to be inoculated into the fermentation base medium as starters, is<br>
not particularly limited, the inoculation ratio is preferably 100:1 to 1:10, and more<br>
preferably 10:1 to 1:1. Although both amounts of Bifidobacterium and the bacteria<br>
belonging to the genus Lactococcus to be inoculated in the fermentation base medium are<br>
not particularly limited, it is preferable that the sum amount thereof be 0.01 to 10%<br>
(V/V), more preferably 0.1 to 5% (V/V), with respect to the amount of the fermentation<br>
base medium.<br>
[0046]<br>
The lactic acid bacteria to be used in the present invention may further contain<br>
other lactic acid bacteria in addition to Bifidobacterium and the bacteria belonging to the<br>
genus Lactococcus, unless the effects of the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus<br>
on the growth-stimulation of Bifidobacterium or the survivability-improvement thereof<br>
during storage are disturbed. Although the other lactic acid bacteria are not particularly<br>
limited, provided that the other lactic acid bacteria are usually used to produce fermented<br>
milk, the other lactic acid bacteria are preferably Streptococcus thermophilus and<br>
Lactobacillus bulgaricus. The inoculation ratio of the total content of Bifidobacterium<br>
and the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus to the total content of the other<br>
lactic acid bacteria, to be inoculated as starters into a fermentation base medium, is not<br>
particularly limited, unless the effects of the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus<br>
on Bifidobacterium are disturbed, it is preferable that the inoculation ratio be within a<br>
range of 1,000:1 to 10:1.<br>
[0047]<br>
It is preferable that co-cultivation temperature in the method for producing<br>
fermented milk according to the present invention be within a range of 30°C to 40°C,<br>
more preferably 36°C to 38°C. Both Bifidobacterium and the bacteria belonging to the<br><br>
genus Lactococcus to be used in the present invention can be sufficiently proliferate in<br>
the above-mentioned temperature range. Although the cultivation time period is<br>
suitably determined depending on the kind of fermented milk to be prepared, the<br>
cultivation time period is preferably within a range of 5 to 18 hours.<br>
[0048]<br>
The fermented milk obtained by cultivation may be provided as a food product,<br>
or may be homogeneously processed into a liquid state. In addition, fruit juice, fruit, or<br>
the like, may be suitably formulated in the fermented milk. The fermented milk may be<br>
put into a container by a conventionally-used method without any particular limitations.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the following, the present invention will be circumstantially explained by<br>
indicating some examples. However, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
following examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0050]<br>
1000 mL of 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium prepared by dissolving<br>
10% by mass of skim milk powders (manufactured by Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Ltd.)<br>
in water was sterilized at 90°C for 30 minutes, and then 30 mL of a seed culture of<br>
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857 was inoculated thereinto, followed by<br>
cultivating at 25°C for 16 hours. On the other hand, 1000 ml of an 11% (W/W) skim<br>
milk medium containing 0.2% (W/W) yeast extract was sterilized at 90°C for 30 minutes,<br>
and 100 mL of a seed culture of Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 was inoculated<br>
thereinto, followed by cultivating at 37°C for 6 hours.<br>
Apart from the above, 50L of a base medium prepared by mixing and dissolving<br>
raw materials composed of skim milk powders, whole milk powders, pectin, and sucrose,<br>
the base medium containing 0.5% (W/W) of butterfat, 8.0% (W/W) of nonfat milk solid<br>
component, 5.0% (W/W) of sucrose, and 0.2% (W/W) of pectin, was sterilized at 90°C<br>
for 10 minutes, followed by cooling at 40°C. 50 mL of the above-obtained culture of<br><br>
the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC857 precultured and 500 mL of the<br>
above-obtained culture of Bifidobacterium longum FERM BP-7787 precultured were<br>
inoculated into the sterilized base medium, followed by cultivating at 37°C for 16 hours<br>
to obtain fermented milk. The fermented milk was immediately cooled while stirring,<br>
and the cooled fermented milk was homogenized at a pressure of 15 MPa, followed by<br>
putting the resultant into a glass container having a 200 mL capacity and then sealing the<br>
container to obtain a yogurt drink. The obtained yogurt drink had a lactic acid content<br>
of 0.68%, a pH of 4.64, and a viscosity of 75 mPa • s, and contained 7.0×108 CFU/g of<br>
Bifidobacterium. When the yogurt drink was stored at 10°C for 21 days, the viable<br>
count of Bifidobacterium was 5.2xl08 CFU/g, and the survival rate thereof was 74%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0051]<br>
30 mL of a seed culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC866 was<br>
inoculated into 1000 mL of a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized at<br>
90°C for 30 minutes, and then cultivated at 25°C for 16 hours. On the other hand, 1000<br>
mL of an 11% (W/W) skim milk medium containing 0.2% (W/W) yeast extract was<br>
sterilized at 90°C for 30 minutes, and 100 ml of a seed culture of Bifidobacterium<br>
longum FERM BP-7787 was inoculated thereinto, followed by cultivating at 37°C for 6<br>
hours. Apart form the above, 50 mL of a mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus<br>
(manufactured by HANSEN) and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (manufactured by HANSEN)<br>
was inoculated into 1500 ml of a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized<br>
at 90°C for 30 minutes, and then cultivated at 37°C for 5 hours.<br>
Apart from the above, 50 L of raw milk containing 3.0% (W/W) of burterfat and<br>
9.0% (W/W) of nonfat milk solid component were heated at 70°C, homogenized at a<br>
pressure of 15 MPa, sterilized at 90°C for 10 minutes, and then cooled at 40°C. Into the<br>
thus sterilized base medium, 500 mL of the culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MCC866 precultured as described above, 500 mL of the culture of Bifidobacterium<br>
longum FERM BP-7787, and 5 ml of the mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus<br><br>
and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were inoculated. The resultant was put into a resin<br>
container having a 500 mL capacity, and then the container was sealed. The bacteria<br>
were cultivated at 37°C for 7 hours, and then immediately cooled. The thus obtained<br>
fermented milk had a lactic acid content of 0.72%, and a pH of 4.55, and contained<br>
5.8x10 CFU/g of Bifidobacterium. When the fermented milk was stored at 10°C for 21<br><br>
days, the viable count of Bifidobacterium was 3.6×10 CFU/g, and the survival rate<br>
thereof was 62%.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0052]<br>
30 mL of a seed culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MCC865 was<br>
inoculated into 1000 mL of a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized at<br>
90°C for 30 minutes, and then cultivated at 25°C for 16 hours. On the other hand, 1000<br>
mL of an 11% (W/W) skim milk medium containing 0.2% (W/W) yeast extract was<br>
sterilized at 90°C for 30 minutes, and 100 ml of a seed culture of Bifidobacterium<br>
longum FERM BP-7787 was inoculated thereinto, followed by cultivation at 37°C for 6<br>
hours. Apart from the above, 50 mL of a mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus<br>
(manufactured by HANSEN) and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (manufactured by HANSEN)<br>
was inoculated into 1500 ml of a 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium sterilized<br>
at 90°C for 30 minutes, and then cultivated at 42°C for 5 hours.<br>
Apart from the above, 500 L of raw milk containing 3.4% (W/W) of butterfat<br>
and 12.2%) (W/W) of nonfat milk solid component were heated at 70°C, homogenized at<br>
a pressure of 15 MPa, sterilized at 90°C for 10 minutes, and then cooled at 40°C. Into<br>
the thus sterilized base medium, 5 L of the culture of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis<br>
MGC865 precultured as described above, 5 L of the culture of Bifidobacterium longum<br>
FERM BP-7787, and 50 ml of the mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and<br>
Lactobacillus bulgaricus were inoculated, and then cultivated at 37°C for 7.5 hours,<br>
followed by immediately cooling. The thus obtained fermented milk was further stirred<br>
to pulverize curd, and the pulverized fermented milk was mixed with blueberry preserve<br><br>
prepared by a conventional method at a ratio of 7:3.. The mixture was homogenized by<br>
stirring, and then put into an oxidation barrier paper-container having a 120 mL capacity.<br>
The thus obtained fermented milk with blueberry pulp had a lactic acid content of 0.80%,<br>
and a pH of 4.45, and contained 5.5×10 CFU/g of Bifidobacterium. When the<br>
fermented milk with blueberry pulp was stored at 10°C for 21 days, the viable count of<br>
Bifidobacterium was 3.9×10 CFU/g, and the survival rate thereof was 71%.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a fermented milk,<br>
including: performing fermentation using both bacteria belonging to the genus<br>
Bifidobacterium and bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus as lactic acid bacteria,<br>
wherein the bacteria belonging to the genus Lactococcus have the following<br>
bacteriological properties: (1) fermentability which curdles a 10% (WAV) reconstituted<br>
skim milk medium when cultivated at a temperature of 25°C to 37°C for 16 hours; (2)<br>
Bifidobacterium longum growth-promoting properties which lead to a viable count of<br>
Bifidobacterium longum of 5×108 CFU/g or more, when co-cultivated with<br>
Bifidobacterium longum in the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim milk medium until the pH<br>
thereof is 4.4 to 4.6; and (3) Bifidobacterium longum survivability-improving properties<br>
during storage, which lead to a survival rate of Bifidobacterium longum of 30% or more,<br>
after co-cultivation with Bifidobacterium longum in the 10% (W/W) reconstituted skim<br>
milk medium until the pH thereof is 4.4 to 4.6, rapid cooling, and two weeks storage at<br>
10°C, and also relates to a fermented milk prepared by the production method.<br></td>
