				<td>BETA-SUBSTITUTED TETRAHYDROPYRAN(ONE)S,<br>
SYNTHETIC PROCESS THEREFOR AND USE THEREOF<br>
IN PERFUMERY<br>
The present invention relates in general to the field<br>
of fragrant agents and to the use thereof especially in<br>
perfumery, in particular in topical compositions and<br>
maintenance products. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to the use, as fragrant agents, of<br>
tetrahydropyran(one) compounds - i.e. tetrahydropyrans<br>
and tetrahydropyranones - substituted in the beta<br>
position relative to the ring oxygen, as a result of<br>
their citrus, verbena, fruity or nitrile notes, and<br>
also relates to the process for synthesizing them.<br>
The term perfumery is used herein to denote not only<br>
perfumery in the usual sense of the term, but also<br>
other fields in which the odor of products is<br>
important. These may be perfumery compositions in the<br>
usual sense of the term, such as fragrancing bases and<br>
concentrates, eaux de Cologne, eaux de toilette,<br>
fragrances and similar products; topical compositions -<br>
in particular cosmetic compositions - such as facial<br>
and body creams, talc powders, hair oils, shampoos,<br>
hair lotions, bath salts and oils, shower and bath<br>
gels, toiletry soaps, antiperspirants and body<br>
deodorants, shaving lotions and creams, soaps, creams,<br>
toothpastes, mouthwashes, salves and similar products;<br>
and maintenance products, such as softeners,<br>
detergents, laundry washing products, ambient<br>
deodorizers, and similar products.<br>
The term "fragrant" is used herein to denote a compound<br>
that gives off an odor.<br>
Certain lactones (i.e. tetrahydropyranones) and certain<br>
pyrans are already used in perfumery. Most of the<br>
lactones used in perfumery are fatty acid derivatives<br><br>
and are thus substituted in position 6, for instance<br>
γ-decalactone or γ-dodecalactone which give a fruity,<br>
balsamic note to fragrant compositions. This is<br>
likewise the case for the use of pyrans in perfumery,<br>
which are also substituted in the alpha position<br>
relative to the oxygen incorporated in the ring. To<br>
mention but two: rose oxide and Doremox® from Firmenich<br>
give typical notes for rose compositions.<br>
There is a need for other fragrant agents in order to<br>
broaden the range of notes that may be given to a<br>
composition and the options available for adding these<br>
notes.<br>
Moreover, the known synthetic processes may be<br>
improved. Tetrahydropyranones have often been<br>
synthesized via enzymatic oxidation of the<br>
corresponding ketone as described by Margaret M. Kayser<br>
et al., Journal of Organic Chemistry (1998), 63 (20),<br>
7103-7106; and Stephanie C. Lemoult et al. , Journal of<br>
the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 1: Organic<br>
and Bio-Organic Chemistry (1995),	(2), 89-91.<br>
Chemically, they are synthesized from oxetanes<br>
(Masahiko Yamaguchi et al. , Tetrahedron Letters (1984),<br>
25 (11), 1159-62) or via a Mukaiyama-Michael reaction<br>
between silylketene acetals and alkylidenemalonates<br>
(David A. Evans et al. , J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1999), 121<br>
(9), 1994-1995).<br>
Four main synthetic routes have been used for the<br>
synthesis of tetrahydropyrans: the Prins reaction, as<br>
already described by Paul R. Straps in J. Org. Chem;<br>
(1969), 34 (3), 479-85, the radical addition of<br>
acetylene derivatives to tetrahydropyran (Montaudon, E.<br>
et al., Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. (1974), 11, Pt. 2, 2635-8)<br>
or via cyclization of a diol, synthesized from a<br>
diacid, as described by E. Montaudon et al., (J.<br>
Heterocycl. Chem. (1979), 16 (11), 113-21) and Paul R.<br>
Strapp in the abovementioned publication.<br><br>
However, these processes are difficult to perform on an<br>
industrial scale. It is thus necessary to find a<br>
synthetic route that can be industrialized while at the<br>
same time giving access to a large number of different<br>
compounds.<br>
One subject of the invention is a fragrant agent<br>
consisting of a tetrahydropyran(one) compound<br>
substituted in the beta position relative to the ring<br>
oxygen, represented by the following formula:<br><br>
in which the substituent R represents a linear alkyl<br>
radical CH3-(CH2)n- with n = 2 to 10 inclusive, (CH3)2CH-<br>
or C6H5-(CH2)m-, with m = 0 or 1;<br><br>
and in which A represents -CH2- or -CO-.<br>
More specifically, a subject of the invention is a<br>
fragrant agent consisting of a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-<br>
one or tetrahydropyran compound, substituted in the<br>
beta position relative to the ring oxygen, of formulae<br>
(Ia) and (Ib), respectively:<br><br>
in which R has the same meaning as in formula (I).<br>
Formula (Ia) corresponds to formula (I) in which A<br>
represents -CO-.<br><br>
Formula (Ib) corresponds to formula (I) in which A<br>
represents -CH2- .<br>
In other words, a subject of the invention is the use,<br>
as a fragrant agent, of a compound of formula (I) , (Ia)<br>
or (Ib).<br>
In certain embodiments, R represents in formula (I) ,<br>
(Ia) or (Ib) a linear alkyl radical CH3-(CH2)n- with n =<br>
4 to 10 inclusive. In certain embodiments, R represents<br>
in this formula a linear alkyl radical CH3-(CH2)n- with<br>
n = 4 to 8 inclusive, or alternatively a linear alkyl<br>
radical CH3-(CH2)n- with n = 6 to 10 inclusive.<br>
In particular, a subject of the invention is a fragrant<br>
agent chosen from the following fragrant agents, in<br>
other words the use as a fragrant agent of one of the<br>
following molecules:<br>
5-pentyltetrahydropyran-2-one,<br>
3 -heptyltetrahydropyran,<br>
5-heptyltetrahydropyran-2-one,<br>
3-benzyltetrahydropyran,<br>
the substituents corresponding to R in formula (I)<br>
being linear.<br>
Among the fragrant agents represented in formula (I) ,<br>
some are, to the inventors' knowledge, novel molecules<br>
which are thus claimed as such. They are:<br>
5-pentyltetrahydropyran-2-one,<br>
5-nony1tetrahydropyran-2 -one,<br>
5-benzyltetrahydropyran-2-one,<br>
5-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl)tetrahydropyran-2-<br>
one,<br>
3 -heptyltetrahydropyran,<br>
3-octyltetrahydropyran,<br>
3 -nony1tetrahydropyran,<br>
3 -decyltet rahydropyran,<br>
3-undecyltetrahydropyran, and<br><br>
3-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopent-3-enyl)tetrahydropyran,<br>
the substituents corresponding to R in formula (I)<br>
being linear.<br>
In other words, a subject of the invention is molecules<br>
of formula (I)<br><br>
in which<br>
the substituent R represents a linear alkyl radical<br>
CH3-(CH2)n- with n = 6 to 10 inclusive,<br><br>
when A represents -CH2-,<br>
and<br>
the substituent R represents a linear alkyl radical<br>
CH3-(CH2)n- with n = 4, 6 or 8, or C6H5-<br><br>
when A represents -CO-.<br>
To the inventors' knowledge, none of the compounds<br>
represented in formula I has to date been described as<br>
having fragrant properties, and none has to date been<br>
used in perfumery.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a composition<br>
comprising a base product and an effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I) as defined above.<br>
It may be a fragrancing composition in which the<br>
fragrant agent is used to mask or neutralize certain<br>
odors, or alternatively to significantly improve the<br><br>
olfactive note of this same composition. Specifically,<br>
the fragrant agent of formula (I) gives the fragrancing<br>
composition that comprises it a richer, more dynamic,<br>
more intense and broader olfactive note than the same<br>
fragrancing composition without its presence. Said<br>
composition may be chosen from perfumery compositions<br>
in the usual sense of the term, such as fragrancing<br>
bases and concentrates, eaux de Cologne, eaux de<br>
toilette, fragrances and similar products; topical<br>
compositions - in particular cosmetic compositions<br>
such as facial and body creams, talc powders, hair<br>
oils, shampoos, hair lotions, bath salts and oils,<br>
shower and bath gels, toiletry soaps, antiperspirants<br>
and body deodorants, shaving lotions and creams, soaps,<br>
creams, toothpastes, mouthwashes, salves, and similar<br>
products; and maintenance products, such as softeners,<br>
detergents, laundry washing products, ambient<br>
deodorizers, and similar products.<br>
The base product will be readily determined by a person<br>
skilled in the art as a function of the intended<br>
composition and thus of the intended use, for which the<br>
usual components - such as solvent(s) and/or<br>
adjuvants(s) as nonlimiting examples - are well known.<br>
The effective amount of the compound of formula (I)<br>
incorporated into the composition will vary according<br>
to the compound, the nature of the composition, the<br>
desired fragrant effect, and the nature of the other<br>
fragrant or non-fragrant compounds that may be present,<br>
and may be readily determined by a person skilled in<br>
the art, given that it may vary within a very wide<br>
range, from 0.1% to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1%<br>
to 50% by weight and especially 0.1% to 30% by weight.<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be present in the form of<br>
an isomer or a mixture of isomers, in particular an<br>
enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers, or a racemic<br>
mixture.<br><br>
Said compound may be used as sole fragrant agent or, as<br>
is common in perfumery, it may be in a mixture with one<br>
or more other fragrant compounds, that a person skilled<br>
in the art is capable of selecting as a function of the<br>
desired effect. The additional fragrant agent(s) may be<br>
compounds of formula (I) or other fragrant agents known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
Said compound may be used as such or it may be<br>
incorporated into or onto an inert support material or<br>
a material that may contain other active ingredients of<br>
the finished composition. A wide variety of support<br>
materials may be used, including, for example, polar<br>
solvents, oils, greases, finely divided solids,<br>
cyclodextrins, maltodextrins, gums, resins and any<br>
other support material known for such compositions.<br>
A subject of the invention is also a process for<br>
synthesizing compounds of formula (I). A synthetic<br>
scheme relative to one embodiment is presented below.<br><br><br>
in which R has the same meaning as in formula (I), (Ia)<br>
or (Ib) , and R' represents CH3 or C2H5 or a higher<br>
alcohol ester, preferably a commercially available<br>
product such as CH3 or C2H5 so as not to increase the<br>
cost of the synthesis.<br>
In this scheme, compound (9) corresponds to a compound<br>
of formula (Ia), whereas compound (11) corresponds to a<br>
compound of formula (Ib).<br>
All the compounds of formula (I) may be synthesized by<br>
reduction starting with a single oxo ester compound of<br>
formula (6)<br><br>
in which R has the same meaning as in formula (I) and<br>
R' represents CH3 or C2H5- or a higher alcohol ester.<br>
A subject of the invention is thus a process for<br>
synthesizing a compound of formula (I), comprising the<br>
reduction of an oxo ester compound of formula (6).<br>
Depending on the reduction reaction conditions, a<br>
compound of formula (Ia) or (Ib) is obtained.<br>
The oxo ester compound (6) may be synthesized via a<br>
process comprising the condensation of a secondary<br>
amine with an aldehyde, to form an enamine, followed by<br>
condensation of the enamine obtained with an acrylate,<br>
to form an enamine ester which is hydrolyzed to an oxo<br>
ester. This synthetic route has the advantage of<br>
limiting the self-condensation reactions of the<br>
aldehyde.<br><br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the oxo<br>
ester compound (6) is synthesized in the following<br>
manner.<br>
In a first stage, an enamine (3) is formed from an<br>
aldehyde (1) and a secondary amine. This reaction is<br>
preferably performed with a cyclic amine, for instance<br>
piperidine or morpholine (2), but other amines, such as<br>
acyclic amines, may also be used. Morpholine is<br>
advantageous for economic reasons (low cost). The<br>
reaction does not require the use of a catalyst, but<br>
catalysts usually used for the formation of enamines<br>
may be used. Their use does not increase either the<br>
yield or the degree of conversion; however, they may<br>
increase the rate of the reaction. The secondary amine<br>
(2) is heated in a solvent, for instance cyclohexane,<br>
to the temperature at which the azeotrope of the<br>
solvent and of water begins to distill. The aldehyde<br>
(1)	is added at this temperature, preferably slowly so<br>
as to minimize its self-condensation. At the end of the<br>
reaction, the solvent and the excess secondary amine<br>
(2)	are evaporated off under reduced pressure. The<br>
enamine (3) (which is an alkenylmorpholine when the<br>
secondary amine is a morpholine) is used directly in<br>
the following reaction. A purification by distillation<br>
is not necessary and does not increase the yield of the<br>
subsequent Michael reaction.<br>
A suitable base such as potassium hydroxide in methanol<br>
(about 1 mol%) is added to the enamine (3) , and the<br>
mixture is preferably brought to about 50°C. An<br>
acrylate (4) is added slowly and the reaction medium is<br>
again stirred, preferably at a high temperature, after<br>
the end of the addition. An enamine ester (5) is thus<br>
formed. If the reaction is performed at a lower<br>
temperature, the conversion is slow, whereas a higher<br>
temperature (of about 50°C) promotes the polymerization<br>
of the acrylate (4) and is thus preferred.<br><br>
The enamine ester (5) is then hydrolyzed with a<br>
suitable acid, to give the oxo ester (6). Hydrolysis is<br>
performed at a temperature of about 20°C to 80°C,<br>
preferably about 60°C. The appropriate acid used in the<br>
hydrolysis of the enamine ester (5) may be a mineral<br>
acid, for instance hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid,<br>
or alternatively a solution of acetic acid buffered<br>
with sodium acetate. Treatment with acetic acid has the<br>
advantage of being milder and gives a higher yield for<br>
the oxo ester (6) than a treatment with hydrochloric<br>
acid, for example. Under the conditions described<br>
above, the partial saponification of the oxo ester (6)<br>
to the corresponding oxo acid (6') cannot be entirely<br>
avoided. The duration of the hydrolysis should thus be<br>
carefully chosen so as to limit the formation of the<br>
corresponding oxo acid (6'). In particular, this<br>
duration is from 2 hours to 8 hours and preferably<br>
3 hours to 6 hours. The reaction yield is about 60-70%.<br>
A subject of the invention is a process for<br>
synthesizing a compound of formula (I) , the process<br>
comprising the reduction of an oxo ester of formula (6)<br><br>
in which R has the same meaning as in formula (I) and<br>
R' represents CH3 or C2HS- or a higher alcohol ester.<br>
According to the conditions of reduction of the oxo<br>
ester (6) , either a hydroxy ester (7) is obtained,<br>
which is a precursor of a lactone derivative (9) ,<br>
corresponding to a compound of formula (Ia), or a diol<br>
(10) is obtained, which leads, via acid treatment, to a<br>
pyran (11) corresponding to a compound of formula (Ib).<br>
The hydroxy ester (7) is not isolated: it is converted<br>
to a lactone in a yield of 60-70%, generally 67%.<br><br>
The diols are isolated and converted to the<br>
corresponding tetrahydropyrans in yields of about<br>
60-70%.<br>
The overall yield for the synthesis according to the<br>
invention is about 35-45%, both for the production of<br>
the products of formula (Ia) and of the products of<br>
formula (Ib).<br>
A subject of the invention is a process for<br>
synthesizing a compound of formula (I) , the process<br>
comprising the reduction of an oxo ester of formula (6)<br>
with a suitable reducing agent,<br>
a)	at low temperature, to form a hydroxy ester (7) ,<br>
followed by saponification with a suitable base,<br>
and then hydrolysis with a suitable acid, followed<br>
by cyclization to form a compound of formula (Ia),<br>
or<br>
b)	at high temperature, to form a diol (10), followed<br>
by cyclization to form a compound of formula (Ib).<br>
The term "low temperature" means a temperature from<br>
about -10°C to 10°C, preferably from about -5°C to 5°C<br>
and more preferably of about 0°C. The term "high<br>
temperature" means a temperature from about 3 0°C to<br>
50°C, preferably from about 30°C to 40°C and more<br>
preferably of about 35°C.<br>
Needless to say, a person skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the amount of reducing agent required<br>
is variable depending on whether only the aldehyde is<br>
reduced or whether the two functions are reduced, and<br>
he will be able to determine the appropriate amount as<br>
a function of the intended objective. As a guide, for<br>
the reduction of the aldehyde, it is appropriate to add<br>
about 0.2 5 equivalent (mol) and about 0.75 equivalent<br>
(mol) for the reduction of the two functions.<br><br>
A suitable reducing agent for the selective reduction<br>
of the aldehyde function may be sodium borohydride or<br>
polymethylhydrosiloxanes or boranes. Strong reducing<br>
agents are required for the formation of the diol, for<br>
example sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride,<br>
aluminum triisopropoxide or simply sodium.<br>
In one embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, the reduction of the oxo ester (6) using a<br>
reducing agent, for example sodium borohydride or<br>
polymethylhydrosiloxane, may be performed at low<br>
temperature, i.e. from about -10°C to 10°C, preferably<br>
from about -5°C to 5°C and more preferably at about<br>
0°C, in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or methanol,<br>
with an amount of reducing agent corresponding to about<br>
0.2 to 0.3 molar equivalent and preferably slightly<br>
more than about 0.25 molar equivalent (optionally<br>
increased by the amount required to neutralize the oxo<br>
acid (6') present in the reaction medium if the oxo<br>
ester has been synthesized via the process described<br>
above) . A hydroxy ester (7) is thus obtained. The<br>
hydroxy ester may be saponified directly, without the<br>
need for recovery, with a suitable base such as sodium<br>
hydroxide in aqueous medium. The aqueous phase is then<br>
extracted with a suitable solvent such as toluene to<br>
remove the alcohol that forms from the aldehyde of<br>
self-condensation of the starting aldehyde. The<br>
reaction medium is then acidified with a suitable acid<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, which allows simultaneous<br>
hydrolysis of the boron salts and the sodium salts of<br>
the hydroxy acid (8) . The hydroxy acid (8) cannot be<br>
isolated since it cyclizes spontaneously in acidic<br>
medium, forming a 5-lactone (9) corresponding to a<br>
compound of formula (Ia) . The lactone is recovered and<br>
purified by distillation.<br>
In another embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, the reduction of the oxo ester by means of a<br>
reducing agent, for example sodium borohydride or<br><br>
lithium aluminum hydride, is performed at a temperature<br>
of about 30°C to 50°C, preferably of about 30°C to 40°C<br>
and more preferably about 35°C, in a suitable solvent<br>
such as ethanol or isopropanol, with an amount of<br>
reducing agent corresponding to about 0.6 to 1.2 molar<br>
equivalents and preferably slightly more than one molar<br>
equivalent (optionally supplemented with the amount<br>
necessary to neutralize the oxo acid (6') present in<br>
the reaction medium if the oxo ester was synthesized<br>
via the process described above). The ester function is<br>
reduced to give a diol (10) . The reaction medium is<br>
then acidified with a suitable acid, such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous medium is extracted<br>
with a suitable solvent such as toluene to recover the<br>
diol. A diol of low molecular mass, in particular, is<br>
highly soluble in water. Care should thus be taken to<br>
ensure that the recovery of the diol (10) is<br>
quantitative. The diol (10) is then purified by<br>
distillation, followed by cyclization, for example by<br>
treating the diol with a suitable acid such as 85%<br>
phosphoric acid, at a suitable temperature, in<br>
particular between 120°C and 140°C, to form a pyran<br>
(11) corresponding to a compound of formula (Ib) . The<br>
pyran (11) is recovered and purified by distillation.<br>
The processes for synthesizing a compound of formula<br>
(I) comprising the reduction of an oxo ester of formula<br>
(6) may include the steps of synthesizing the oxo ester<br>
of formula (6) described above in combination with the<br>
processes for synthesizing said oxo ester.<br>
The examples that follow further illustrate the<br>
fragrant agents according to the invention, and also<br>
the use, synthesis and value thereof. These examples<br>
are given merely for the purpose of illustration and<br>
cannot be considered as limiting the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
Example 1: Synthesis of methyl 4-formylnonanoate (6):<br>
418.0 g (4.80 mol) of morpholine and 344.0 g of<br>
cyclohexane are placed in a four-liter round-bottomed<br>
flask with a magnetic stirrer, a water separator, a<br>
thermometer and an addition funnel. The mixture is<br>
brought to a temperature of 65°C to 70°C. 444.2 g<br>
(3.89 mol) of heptanal are added over five hours. The<br>
boiling point (80°C-84°C at the start of addition and<br>
then 87 °C toward the end of the operation) is thus<br>
rapidly obtained. The water formed during the reaction<br>
is recovered in a water separator. The reaction medium<br>
is then cooled and the cyclohexane and the excess<br>
morpholine are distilled off under reduced pressure<br>
(about 4400 Pa) without exceeding 80°C in the bulk. The<br>
mixture is cooled to 40°C, brought to ambient pressure<br>
and 4.0 g of potassium hydroxide in 40 ml of methanol<br>
are added to the 4-hept-1(E/Z)-enylmorpholine. The<br>
mixture is brought to 60°C and 237.5 g (2.76 mol) of<br>
methyl acrylate are then added over 4 hours. The<br>
mixture is stirred for 12 hours at 60°C and a further<br>
165.3 g (1.92 mol) of methyl acrylate are then added<br>
over two hours thirty minutes. At the end of the<br>
addition, the temperature of the reaction medium is<br>
increased to 80°C and stirring is continued for 12<br>
hours. An aqueous solution of acetic acid buffered to<br>
pH 4 (587.3 g of acetic acid, 215.3 g of sodium acetate<br>
trihydrate and 697.5 g of water) is added dropwise over<br>
two hours at this temperature. Stirring is continued<br>
for a further four hours. The phases are allowed to<br>
settle and are separated. The aqueous phase is<br>
extracted twice with 200 ml of cyclohexane. The organic<br>
phases are combined and washed once with 100 ml of<br>
water, once with 100 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution and once with 150 ml of brine. The resulting<br>
organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate. After<br>
evaporating off the solvent under reduced pressure<br>
(3990 Pa), without exceeding 50°C in the bulk, 890.0 g<br>
of crude oxo ester are obtained, and are blanched under<br><br>
high vacuum (80°C to 95°C at 80 Pa) to give 663.0 g of<br>
82.7% methyl 4-formylnonanoate (yield: 2.74 mol; 70%).<br>
Example 2: Synthesis of 5-pentyltetrahydropyran-2-one<br>
(9) :<br>
1560.0 g of ethanol and 663.0 g (max. 2.74 mol) of<br>
82.7% methyl 4-formylnonanoate obtained in Example 1<br>
are placed in a four-liter round-bottomed flask with a<br>
mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, and the mixture<br>
is cooled to 0°C. 41.6 g (1.10 mol) of sodium<br>
borohydride are then added dropwise over four hours,<br>
without exceeding 5°C in the bulk. Stirring is<br>
continued after the end of the addition for a further<br>
24 hours at 0°C. 1900.0 g of aqueous 10% sodium<br>
hydroxide solution are added dropwise over two hours,<br>
without exceeding 10°C in the bulk. A white precipitate<br>
forms. Stirring is continued until the dissolution of<br>
the precipitate is complete (about two hours). The<br>
flask is placed under a vacuum of about 3990 Pa and the<br>
ethanol is distilled off. The aqueous phase obtained is<br>
extracted twice with 200 ml of a mixture of toluene and<br>
hexane (50/50) to remove the neutral products. The<br>
aqueous phase is then cooled to 0°C. The resulting<br>
phase is acidified with 1900.0 g of 10% hydrochloric<br>
acid for three hours, without exceeding 10°C in the<br>
bulk. After the end of the addition, stirring is<br>
continued for four hours, while allowing the<br>
temperature of the reaction medium to rise to room<br>
temperature (20°C). The phases are allowed to separate<br>
by settling and the organic phase is recovered. The<br>
aqueous phase is extracted twice with 200 ml of<br>
toluene. The organic phases are combined and are washed<br>
twice with 100 ml of water and once with 200 ml of<br>
brine, and then concentrated under reduced pressure<br>
(3990 Pa). 696.0 g of a crude product are obtained, and<br>
are then blanched at 133 Pa to give 468.0 g of 86.1%<br>
5-pentyltetrahydropyran-2-one. After distillation on a<br>
Vigreux column, a core fraction of 289.0 g (1.70 mol)<br><br>
of 98.3% 5-pentyltetrahydropyran-2-one is obtained (90-<br>
2°C/27 Pa) in a yield of 61%.<br>
Example 3: Synthesis of methyl 4-formylundecanoate (6):<br>
104.4 g (1.20 mol) of morpholine and 210.0 g of<br>
cyclohexane are placed in a one-liter round-bottomed<br>
flask with a magnetic stirrer, a water separator, a<br>
thermometer and an addition funnel. The mixture is<br>
brought to a temperature of 65°C to 70°C. 142.0 g<br>
(0.99 mol) of nonanal are added over four hours. The<br>
boiling point (80°C-84°C at the start of the addition<br>
and then 87°C toward the end of the operation) is thus<br>
rapidly obtained. The water formed during the reaction<br>
is recovered in a water separator. The reaction medium<br>
is then cooled and the cyclohexane and the excess<br>
morpholine are distilled off under reduced pressure<br>
(about 4400 Pa), without exceeding 60°C in the bulk.<br>
The mixture is cooled to 40 °C and returned to ambient<br>
pressure, and 1.5 g of potassium hydroxide in 20 ml of<br>
methanol are added to the 4-non-1(E/Z)-enylmorpholine.<br>
The mixture is brought to 50°C and 85.5 g (0.99 mol) of<br>
methyl acrylate are added over one hour. The mixture is<br>
stirred for fifteen hours at 50°C, and then a further<br>
43.0 g (0.50 mol) of methyl acrylate are added over one<br>
hour thirty minutes. After the end of the addition, the<br>
mixture is stirred for a further twelve hours at 60°C.<br>
The temperature of the reaction medium is increased to<br>
80°C. An aqueous solution of acetic acid buffered to<br>
pH 4 (195.7 g of acetic acid, 71.7 g of sodium acetate<br>
trihydrate and 232.6 g of water) are added dropwise<br>
over two hours at this temperature. Stirring is<br>
continued for a further four hours. The phases are<br>
allowed to settle and are separated. The aqueous phase<br>
is extracted twice with 150 ml of toluene. The organic<br>
phases are combined and are washed three times with<br>
100 ml of water and once with 100 ml of brine. The<br>
resulting organic phase is dried over magnesium<br>
sulfate. After evaporating off the solvent under<br>
reduced pressure (3990 Pa), without exceeding 50°C in<br><br>
the bulk, 237.0 g of crude oxo ester are obtained, and<br>
are blanched under high vacuum (70°C to 120°C at 93 Pa)<br>
to give 152.1 g of 91.0% methyl 4-formylundecanoate<br>
(yield: 0.61 mol; 61%).<br>
Example 4: Synthesis of 2-heptylpentane-1,5-diol (10):<br>
390.0 g of isopropanol and 22.4 g (0.59 mol) of sodium<br>
borohydride are placed in a one-liter round-bottomed<br>
flask with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer and an<br>
addition funnel. 148.4 g (0.59 mol) of 91% methyl<br>
4-formylundecanoate (6) are added dropwise over one<br>
hour. The temperature in the bulk rises to 35°C during<br>
the addition. The addition is continued for 29 hours,<br>
while allowing the temperature in the bulk to return to<br>
room temperature (about 20°C). After cooling the<br>
reaction medium to 5°C, 8.6 g of acetone are added,<br>
without exceeding 10°C in the bulk. The reaction medium<br>
is again cooled to 5°C and 240.0 g of hydrochloric acid<br>
are added over one hour, without exceeding 10°C in the<br>
bulk. 250.0 g of water are added to facilitate the<br>
separation of the phases. The aqueous phase is<br>
extracted twice with 200 ml of toluene. The organic<br>
phases are combined and are washed once with 100.0 ml<br>
of water and once with 100 ml of brine. The resulting<br>
organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and<br>
filtered. The solvent is evaporated off under reduced<br>
pressure (3990 Pa) without exceeding 50°C in the bulk.<br>
118.0 g (0.42 mol) of 72% 2-heptylpentane-1,5-diol (10)<br>
are obtained, and are used directly in the cyclization<br>
step.<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of 3-heptyltetrahydropyran (11):<br>
60.6 g (0.21 mol) of 2-heptylpentane-1,5-diol are<br>
placed in a 500 ml round-bottomed flask with a magnetic<br>
stirrer, a condenser, a thermometer and an addition<br>
funnel, and 52. 6 g of 85% phosphoric acid are rapidly<br>
added. The temperature in the reaction medium rises to<br>
60°C during the addition. The reaction mixture is<br>
brought to reflux (127°C) and is stirred for four<br><br>
hours. The mixture is cooled to room temperature (about<br>
20°C) and 150 ml of water are added. Stirring is<br>
increased and continued for 30 minutes. The phases are<br>
separated and the aqueous phase is extracted once with<br>
10 0 ml of methyl t-butyl ether. The organic phases are<br>
combined and are washed twice with 50 ml of saturated<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution and once with 50 ml of<br>
brine. The organic phase is dried and filtered, and the<br>
solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure<br>
(3990 Pa) , without exceeding 50°C in the bulk. The<br>
crude product is then distilled on a Vigreux column.<br>
The core fraction contains 28.1 g (0.18 mol) of 96%<br>
3-heptyltetrahydropyran (boiling point: 100°C at<br>
930 Pa). The yield is 73%.<br>
The infrared, NMR and mass spectral analyses of the<br>
compounds obtained show that they correspond to the<br>
structures of the expected compounds.<br>
Example 6: Olfactory evaluation<br>
In a first stage, the fragrant characteristics of<br>
several pure compounds were evaluated by a panel. The<br>
evaluation panel is composed of several professionals,<br>
who qualitatively evaluate each compound. The compounds<br>
were described as fruity, lactonic with notes of fig or<br>
coriander leaves. The results of the evaluations are<br>
collated below:<br>
-	5-propyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one: lactonic, coconut,<br>

nacreous shampoo base (compositions 1, 2 and 3,<br><br>
hours. The mixture is cooled to room temperature (about<br>
20°C) and 150 ml of water are added. Stirring is<br>
increased and continued for 3 0 minutes. The phases are<br>
separated and the aqueous phase is extracted once with<br>
100 ml of methyl t-butyl ether. The organic phases are<br>
combined and are washed twice with 50 ml of saturated<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution and once with 50 ml of<br>
brine. The organic phase is dried and filtered, and the<br>
solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure<br>
(3990 Pa) , without exceeding 50°C in the bulk. The<br>
crude product is then distilled on a Vigreux column.<br>
The core fraction contains 28.1 g (0.18 mol) of 96%<br>
3-heptyltetrahydropyran (boiling point: 100°C at<br>
930 Pa). The yield is 73%.<br>

5-Pentyltetrahydro-2H pyran-2-one and 5-heptyl-<br>
tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one were then tested in a<br>
nacreous shampoo base (compositions 1, 2 and 3,<br><br>
respectively). Their fragrant impact was assessed by<br>
comparing fragrancing compositions without and with<br>
each compound. 3-Benzyltetrahydropyran was tested in a<br>
nacreous shampoo base and in a concentrated softening<br>
base (compositions 4 and 5) . Its fragrant impact was<br>

In each case, the evaluations of the olfactory impact<br>
were conducted at t0, t+6h, t+24h to evaluate the head,<br>
core and back notes.<br>
5-Pentyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one gives composition 1 a<br>
lighter and more airy aspect.<br>
5-Heptyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one gives composition 2 a<br>
more transparent and green aspect. On the other hand,<br>
in composition 3, it gives a less green aspect, but a<br>
more fruit flesh aspect.<br>
3-Benzyltetrahydropyran gives composition 4 a more<br>
natural rhubarb note with a green astringent woody<br>
aspect.<br>
It gives composition 5 more volume and power by<br>
improving the guava note.<br>
The loss of intensity over time appears to be quite<br>
linear, without revealing any major change in fragrant<br>
nature.<br>
The results of these evaluations show without the<br>
slightest doubt that the compounds described above have<br>
advantageous olfactory characteristics, which will find<br>
an application in particular in cosmetics, perfumery,<br>
maintenance products and, in general, in any fragrant<br>
composition in which it is desired to mask or<br>
neutralize odor.<br><br>
