				<td>This invention relates to a method of preparing amine stereoisomers, to novel intermediates useful in the method and to use of certain of the novel intermediates in a method of preparing sulfoxide and sulfinylamine stereoisomers.<br>
Many amine stereoisomers possess useful biological properties. For example, sibutramine is a neuronal monoamine reuptake inhibitor, which has the chemical name [N-l-[l-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]-3-methylbutyl]-N,N-dimethylamine. Originally disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,746,680 and 4,806,570, sibutramine inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, serotonin and dopamine. See, e.g., Buckett et al, Prog. Neuro-psychopharm. &amp; Biol. Psychiat., 12:575-584, 1988; King et al, J. Clin. Pharm., 26:607-611 (1989).<br>
Racemic sibutramine is sold as a hydrochloride monohydrate under the tradename MERIDIA®, and is indicated for the treatment of obesity. Physician's Desk Reference® 1509-1513 (54th ed., 2000). The treatment of obesity using racemic sibutramine is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,436,272.<br>
Sibutramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and undergoes an extensive first-pass metabolism that yields the metabolites desmethylsibutramme ("DMS") and didesmethylsibutramine ("DDMS"), as shown below in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Both didesmethylsibutramine and desmethylsibutramine have interesting and useful biological properties. Each of these sibutramine metabolites can exist as an enantiomeric<br>
pair of R and S enantiomers, as shown below in Scheme n, which also exhibit interesting and useful biological properties:<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br><br>
The preparation of enantiomerically pure metabolites of sibutramine and derivatives thereof {e.g., didesmethylsibutramine) has been difficult. Consequently, a need exists for improved methods of synthesis.<br>
Several methods of preparing amine stereoisomers are known in the art. One general method comprises asymmetric addition to an imine, such as by reduction (which adds hydrogen atoms to the carbon and nitrogen atoms at the ends of the C=N double bond) or by reaction with a source of a nucleophile (which adds hydrogen to the nitrogen atom and the nucleophile to the carbon atom). For example, when the source of a nucleophile is a source of a nitrile, such as HCN, the reaction affords an amine stereoisomer in which hydrogen is added to the nitrogen atom and CN to the carbon atom. The nitrile group may then be hydrolyzed to afford an alpha-substituted amino acid stereoisomer.<br>
One such method that has been reported, for example in Liu et ah, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1997,119, 9913-9914, comprises addition to a sulfinylimine stereoisomer that bears on the sulfinyl group a residue of a hydrocarbyl group, such as p-toluyl or tert-butyl. The resultant sulfinylimine may then be treated with a reagent suitable for the cleavage of a sulfur-nitrogen bond, such as hydrochloric acid, to afford an amine stereoisomer. The sulfinylimine stereoisomers starting materials may be obtained by reacting a carbonyl compound, such as an aldehyde of ketone, with a sulfinamide stereoisomer, such as a p-toluenesulfinamide or tert-butanesulfinanide stereoisomer.<br>
A novel method of preparing amine stereoisomers has now been found that starts with a sulfinylimine that bears on the sulfinyl group a residue of an alcohol, thiol or amine.<br>
According to one aspect, therefore, the present invention provides a method of preparing an amine stereoisomer, which comprises stereoselectively reducing a sulfinylimine that bears on the sulfinyl group a residue of an alcohol, thiol or amine, or reacting a sulfinylimine stereoisomer that bears on the sulfinyl group a residue of an alcohol, thiol or amine with a source of a nucleophile, to afford a sulfinylamine stereoisomer, followed by contacting the sulfinylamine stereoisomer with a reagent suitable for the cleavage of a sulfur-nitrogen bond, to afford an amine stereoisomer.<br>
It will be appreciated that reduction of the sulfinylimine affords a sulfinylamine stereoisomer when the sulfinylimine starting material is a sulfinylimine stereoisomer, or when the reduction is performed using a stereoselective reducing agent. When a sulfinylimine is reduced, hydrogen atoms are added to the nitrogen and carbon atoms of the imine group. When a sulfinylimine stereoisomer is reacted with a source of a nucleophile, a<br><br><br>
hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen atom and the nucleophile to the carbon atom. Examples of sources of nucleophiles include nitriles, Grignard reagents and organolithiums.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the sulfinylimine is a sulfinylimine stereoisomer. The residue of the alcohol, thiol or amine may also be in stereoisomeric form.<br>
Particular mention is made of sulfinylirnines that bear a residue of an alcohol on the sulfinyl group, especially those wherein the residue of the alcohol is a residue of an optionally N-substituted beta-aminoalcohol, thiol or amine, in particular an optionally N-substituted beta-aminoalcohol.<br>
In one embodiment, the N-substituted beta-aminoalcohol, thiol or amine may be represented by the general formula<br><br><br>

By way of illustration, an example of a compound in which R7- and R7» together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached and, optionally R$, form an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclic group is quinidine. An example of a compound in which R7&gt; together with the nitrogen atom to which it is attached and the carbon atom to which the<br><br><br>

When the sulfmylamine has been prepared from a sulfinylimine in which the sulfmyl group bears the residue of an optionally N-substituted beta-aminoalcohol, thiol or amine, treatment of the sulfmylamine with a reagent suitable for the cleavage of a sulfur-nitrogen bond, such as an acid, affords as a second reaction product the optionally N-substituted beta-aminoalcohol, thiol or amine. This alcohol, thiol or amine may advantageously be recycled by converting it into 1,2,3-oxathiazolidine-S-oxide, 1,2,3-oxadiathiazolidine-S-oxide or 1,2,3-azathiazolidine-S-oxide. According to a preferred aspect therefore, the method further comprises recovering optionally N-substituted beta-aminoalcohol, thiol or amine, converting this into 1,2,3-oxathiazolidine-S-oxide and reacting this with an iminometal as described hereinabove.<br>
A sulfinylimine may be reduced to a sulfinylamine stereoisomer using any suitable reducing agent. Thus, it will be appreciated that the reducing agent may be any reducing agent capable of reducing a sulfinylimine to a sulfinylamine, provided that if the sulfinylimine is not a sulfinylimine stereoisomer, then the reducing agent is a stereoselective reducing agent. Examples of reducing agents include hydrogen, in the presence of a group VIII metal catalyst, such as palladium on carbon; boranes; hydrogen transfer reagents, such as cyclohexene and formic acid in the presence of palladium on carbon, and hydride-type reducing agents.<br>

Convenient solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, ethers, such as diethyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) or tetrahydrofuran and alcohols such as methanol or ethanol. Particular mention may be made of ethers, especially tetrahydrofuran. The reduction with the hydride type reducing agent may be performed in<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the presence of a Lewis acid, such as boron tnfluoride, a titanium tetra(l-4C)alkoxide, such as titanium tetraethoxide, titanium tetrapropoxide, titanium tetraisopropoxide; a titanium tetrahalide, such as titanium tetrachloride; a zirconium tetra(l-4C)alkoxide, such as zirconium tetraethoxide or zirconium tetra-t-butoxide; a zinc dihalide, such as zinc dichloride, or a magnesium dihalide, such as magnesium dibromide.

Examples of acids include hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid; sulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid; pyridinium sulfonates, such as pyridium-p-toluenesulfonate; Amberlyst H-15, boric acid and acetic acid. Particular mention may be made of hydrochloric acid. The cleavage of the sulfur-nitrogen bond is conveniently performed at a temperature in the range of from -50 to 50 °C.<br>

Next, compounds 4 and 4' are first treated with a reducing agent to reduce the imine to a stereomerically pure amine with a suitable reducing agent. A wide variety of reagents are available for reduction of such esters to alcohols, e.g., see M. Hudlicky, Reductions in Organic Chemistry, 2nd ed., 1996 pp. 212-217, hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the reduction is effected with a hydride type<br><br>
reducing agent, for example, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, lithium triethyl borohydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, lithium trimethoxyaluminum hydride, or sodium bis(2-methoxy)aluminum hydride. Preferably, the reduction is conducted by adding an organic solution of compounds 4 or 4' to a stirred mixture comprising a reducing agent, preferably sodium borohydride hydride, and an organic solvent. During the addition, the reaction mixture is maintained at a constant temperature within the range of about -20 °C to about 80 °C, preferably at about room temperature. Organic solvents suitable for reduction include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof, preferably tetrahydrofuran. After the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred at a constant temperature within the range of about 0 °C to about -45 °C, until the reaction is substantially complete as determined by using an appropriate analytical method, preferably thin-layer chromatography or high-performance-liquid chromatography. Then the reaction an acid is added to the reaction mixture to facilitate cleavage of the sulfur-nitrogen bond. The sulfur-nitrogen bond is preferably cleaved with an acid. Suitable cleavage reagents include, but are not limited to, aqueous hydrochloric acid,P-toluenesulfonic acid in methanol, pyridinium-p-toluenesulfonate in ethanol, Amberlyst H-15 in methanol, boric acid in ethylene-glycol-monoethylether, acetic acid in a water-tetrahydrofuran mixture, aqueous hydrochloric acid is preferred.   Purification and separation of the stereoisomers (i.e., enantiomers or diastereomers) can be achieved by methods known in the art, for example, conversion to a chiral salt and crystallization, chiral chromatography, or chiral HPLC.<br>

Supporting Information<br>
General. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. All anhydrous solvents were used for the reaction, and were purchased from Aldrich. All reactions, unless otherwise noted, were carried out in oven dried glassware under inert argon atmosphere. Chromatography was carried out using Silicycle 60, 230-400 mesh silica gel. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was performed with Merk Kieselgel 60 F 254 plates, and was visualized using UV light and/or phosphomolybdic staining. lB. NMR and proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian Inova 300 spectrometer in CDCl3 with TMS as an internal standard at room temperature. Proton and carbon spectra chemical shifts were reported using TMS and/or CDCl3 as an internal standard at 0 ppm and at 77.23 ppm, respectively. Diastereomeric ratios were determined on XB. NMR spectrum analyses. Elemental analyses were performed by Quantitative Technologies, Inc., Whitehouse, NJ. Enantiomeric excesses were obtained by chiral HPLC analysis using Chiralpak AS, Chiralcel OB, or Chiralcel OD column.<br><br>
