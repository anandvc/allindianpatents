				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a die casting machine and casting method using<br>
the same wherein a molten metal (melted liquid) is moved horizontally and is<br>
injected into a chamber and the molten metal is then moved vertically and is<br>
injected into a mold with a movable mold and a fixed mold disposed vertically,<br>
whereby the molten metal injected into the mold is prevented from generating a<br>
turbulent flow, so that a product of a good quality with no minute bubbles is<br>
obtained.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a die casting machine having a<br>
vacuum apparatus wherein a material is injected into a vacuum tank disposed in<br>
a melted liquid crucible via a pair of valves and another valve is also disposed<br>
even in a molten metal outflow hole of the vacuum tank to keep the degree of<br>
vacuum within the vacuum tank in a good state, whereby a good-quality product<br>
made of an alloy having a high melting point that is heavily oxidized in air can be<br>
produced, and casting method using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Forming using the casting machine includes injecting a molten metal into a mold<br>
and pressurizing the metal until it is solidified. This method has been widely used<br>
because of accuracy of a cast product, reduction in culling machining, etc.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a conventional die casting machine can be classified<br>
into a horizontal type die casting machine in which a molten metal (melted<br>
liquid) is moved horizontally and a vertical type die casting machine in which the<br>
molten metal is moved vertically. In the horizontal type die casting machine,<br>
when a molten metal is horizontally injected into the mold by a plunger, minute<br>
bubbles are generated due to severe occurrence of a turbulent flow in a L-<br>
shaped bend portion (T) of FIG. 7. Meanwhile, in the vertical type die casting<br>
machine, when a molten metal is horizontally injected into the mold by the<br>
plunger, minute bubbles are generated due to severe occurrence of a turbulent<br>
flow in a L-shaped bend portion (Q) of FIG. 8.<br>
Therefore, minute bubbles are generated in a product. It is difficult to obtain a<br>
product of a good quality and to product a product of a high quality as 3<br>
conventional die casting machine due to lots of defective products.<br>
In addition, there was disclosed a conventional vacuum apparatus of a die<br>
casting machine for producing a product of a high quality in a vacuum state by<br>
shutting an alloy of a high melting point, which is easily oxidized by oxygen in<br>
air, from oxygen in air. Referring to FIG. 16, the conventional vacuum apparatus<br>
has a construction in which a fixed mold 100, a movable mold 200, a support rod<br>
400 into which an induction coil coolant circulating pipe 110 and a power supply<br>
cable 900 are inserted, a melted liquid crucible 300 to which a high frequency<br>
induction coil 800 is fixed, and nippers 500 for injecting a material into the<br>
melted liquid crucible 300 are surrounded by one vacuum tank 600. In this<br>
construction, however, lots of time is taken to evacuate the interior of the<br>
vacuum tank 600 by means of the vacuum pump 700. Also, the degree of<br>
vacuum within the vacuum tank 600 is not good Therefore, there is a problem<br>
that a product of a good quality is not produced using an alloy of a high melting<br>
point that is easily oxidized in air.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail in connection with preferred<br>
embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 to 6, a die casting machine according to the present<br>
invention includes a pair of supports 2 and 3 that are disposed in the opposite<br>
direction on a machine body 1, a guide rod 5 that connects the supports 2 and 3<br>
to guide a movable support plate 4, and the movable support plate 4 movably<br>
fixed to the guide rod 5, wherein the plate 4 is moved along the guide rod 5 by<br>
means of a piston rod 6A of a first cylinder 6 fixed to one of the supports 2 and<br>
3.<br>
A movable mold 8 and a mold fixing plate 70A for fastening the movable mold 8<br>
are disposed on one side of the movable support plate 4 and a second cylinder<br>
124A is fixed on the other side of the movable support plate 4. A tablet 65 to<br>
which an ejector pin 67 for pushing a shaped product 91A from the movable<br>
mold 8 is fixed is integrally fixed to a piston rod 120A of the second cylinder<br>
124A. A molten metal injection pipe 9 and a mold fixing plate 70 are fixed on one<br>
side of the other one of the supports 2 and 3. A fixed mold 7 having a molten<br>
metal guide hole 91A formed therein is fixed to the mold fixing plate 70. A<br>
support rod 68 is fixed on the other side of the other one of the supports 2 and<br>
3. Further, an additional support plate 131A is disposed at the end of the support<br>
rod 68. A third cylinder 10 is fixed to the support plate 131A, so that a plunger<br>
10A of the third cylinder 10 pushes the molten metal into the molten metal<br>
injection pipe 9. Thus, the metal is cast within the casting space formed by the<br>
fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8 according to the shape of the casting<br>
space.<br>
In the above, the top of the machine body 1 is formed with slant downwardly<br>
from the fixed mold 7 toward the movable mold 8. The support 3 of the supports<br>
2 and 3 to which the fixed mold 7 is fixed includes a projection 3A having the<br>
fixed mold 7 fixed thereto, and a cylinder installation projection 3B having a<br>
fourth cylinder 11 fixed thereto. The fixed mold 7 is fixed to the projection 3A.<br>
The fourth cylinder 11 for driving a follower plunger 11A is fixed to the cylinder<br>
installation projection 3B. A sleeve 62 in which a chamber 55A for containing<br>
molten metals 180A and supplying them into the casting space formed on its top<br>
is formed is fixed to the mold fixing plates 70 and 70A.<br>
That is, according to the present invention, in order to form the product 191A<br>
that is thin and wide, it is preferred that the casting space formed by a<br>
combination of the fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8 is formed in the vertical<br>
direction to the ground. Further, it is preferable that in injecting and shaping the<br>
molten metal into the casting space, the top of the machine body 1 is formed<br>
downwardly with slant from the fixed mold 7 to the movable mold 8. Through<br>
this construction, the molten metal 180A flows in the horizontal direction witn<br>
slant and then enters the chamber 55A of the sleeve 62 that is located at the<br>
bottom of the casting space. In the above, he molten metal 180A is lifted up by<br>
the follower plunger 11A, moved in the vertical direction, introduced into the<br>
casting space and shaped therein.<br>
Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, a turbulent flow of a molten metal,<br>
which usually occurs in the conventional horizontal type die casting machine fcr<br>
horizontally injecting the molten metal 180A and the conventional vertical type<br>
die casting machine for vertically injecting the molten metal 180A, is prevented<br>
from occurring, it is thus possible to fabricate the product 191A of a high quality<br>
with fine structure and no bubbles.<br>
In the above, it can be said that the die casting machine including the pair of the<br>
supports 2 and 3 that are disposed in the opposite direction on the machine body<br>
1, the guide rod 5 that connects the supports 2 and 3 to guide the movable<br>
support plate 4, and the movable support plate 4 movably fixed to the guide rod<br>
5, wherein the plate 4 is moved along the guide rod 5 by means of a piston rod<br>
6A of a first cylinder 6 fixed to one of the supports 2 and 3, the movable mold 8<br>
and the mold fixing plate 70A for fastening the movable mold 8 are disposed on<br>
one side of the movable support plate 4, the second cylinder 124A is fixed on the<br>
other side of the movable support plate 4, the tablet 65 to which the ejector pin<br>
67 for pushing a shaped product 91A from the movable mold 8 is fixed is<br>
integrally fixed to the piston rod 120A of the second cylinder 124A, the molten<br>
metal injection pipe 9 and the mold fixing plate 70 are fixed on one side of the<br>
other one of the supports 2 and 3, the fixed mold 7 having the molten metal<br>
guide hole 91A formed therein is fixed to the mold fixing plate 70, the support<br>
rod 68 is fixed on the other side of the other one of the supports 2 and 3, the<br>
additional support plate 131A is disposed at the end of the support rod 68, and<br>
the third cylinder 10 is fixed to the support plate 131A so that a plunger 10A of<br>
the third cylinder 10 pushes the molten metal into the molten metal injection<br>
pipe 9, whereby the metal is cast within the casting space formed by the fixed<br>
mold 7 and the movable mold 8 according to the shape of the casting space, and<br>
the movable mold 8 is known to those skilled in the art before the present<br>
application was filed.<br>
In the above construction, while the movable mold 8 is moved right and left<br>
against the fixed mold 7, the casting space is formed by a combination of the<br>
fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8. The molten metal 180A is supplied into<br>
the casting space and is then shaped. The movable mold 8 is then separated<br>
from the fixed mold 7. Next, the shaped product 191A is separated from the<br>
movable mold 8 by means of the tablet 65 and the ejector pin 67 fixed thereto.<br>
Therefore, the movable mold 8 and the tablet 65 can be automatically operated.<br>
In other words, in order to combine the movable mold 8 with the fixed mold 7, if<br>
the first cylinder 6 is operated to move the piston rod 6A forward, the movable<br>
support plate 4 fixed to the piston rod 6A is moved toward the support 3 having<br>
the fixed mold 7 fixed thereto. Thus, the fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8<br>
are combined to form the casting space that is made evacuated for shaping.<br>
Next, if the molten metal 180A is supplied through the molten metal injection<br>
pipe 9 fixed to the support 3, the molten metal 180A is introduced into the<br>
casting space and becomes the shaped product 191A while being cooled therein.<br>
At this time, in supplying the molten metal 180A into the casting space, the third<br>
cylinder 10 fixed to the support plate 131A is operated and the molten metal is<br>
thus pushed into the molten metal injection pipe 9 by means of the plunger 10A<br>
followed by the third cylinder 10. Thereby, the molten metal is introduced into<br>
the casting space formed by the fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8. Then,<br>
after some time elapse, the first cylinder 6 operates to move the piston rod 6A<br>
backward, the movable meld 8 is separated from the fixed mold 7.<br>
Thereafter, if the second cylinder 124A fixed to the movable support plate 4 is<br>
operated to move the piston rod 120A forward and thus move the tablet 65<br>
forward, the product 191A attached to the movable mold 8 is separated by the<br>
ejector pin 67 integrally fixed to the tablet 65, as shown in FIG. 6. The cast<br>
product 191A is formed by repeatedly performing a series of the aforementioned<br>
operations.<br>
In the present invention, more particularly, in order to facilitate the flow of the<br>
molten metal 180A, the top of the machine body 1 is formed downwardly with<br>
slant from the fixed mold 7 to the movable mold 8. The molten metal injection<br>
pipe 9 may be formed with slant and then fixed to the mold fixing plate 70 of the<br>
support 3. However, it would be disadvantages in close contact between the<br>
molten metal injection pipe 9 and the mold fixing plate 70. Accordingly, it is<br>
preferred that the whole top of the machine body 1 to which the supports 2 and<br>
3 are fixed is formed with slant against the ground, as described above.<br>
Moreover, the support 3 to which the fixed mold 7 is fixed among the supports 2<br>
and 3 includes the projection 3A having the fixed mold 7 fixed thereto, and the<br>
cylinder installation projection 3B having the fourth cylinder 11 fixed thereto. The<br>
fixed mold 7 is fixed to the projection 3A, and the fourth cylinder 11 for driving<br>
the follower plunger 11A is fixed to the cylinder installation projection 3B.<br>
Therefore, the follower plunger 11A first pushes the molten metal 180A, which is<br>
supplied into the chamber 55A within the sleeve 62, into the casting space<br>
upwards in the horizontal direction. At this time, the fourth cylinder 11 for driving<br>
the follower plunger 11A can be fixed directly under the casting space that is<br>
formed by a combination of the fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8. The<br>
sleeve 62 is inserted into semi-circular sleeve grooves 70B and 70C formed in the<br>
mold fixing plates 70 and 70A. In the above, in order to supply the molten metal<br>
180A from the chamber 55A formed in the sleeve 62 to the casting space,<br>
semicircular vertical molten metal injection grooves 901 and 902 are formed in<br>
the fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8 that form the casting space. The fourth<br>
cylinder 11 that makes a plunger 11A follow it is fixed to cylinder installation<br>
projection 3B at the bottom of the sleeve 62.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the molten metal 180A supplied into<br>
the molten metal injection pipe 9 is injected by means of the plunger 10A of the<br>
third cylinder 10 and is then filled within the chamber 55A of the sleeve 62 via<br>
the molten metal guide hole 91A and the semicircular vertical molten metal<br>
injection grooves 901 and 902, which are formed in the fixed mold 7. The<br>
plunger 10A keeps sealed the molten metal guide hole 91A of the fixed mold 7<br>
and then raises the follower plunger 11A of the fourth cylinder 11. Thus, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5, the molten metal 180A within the semicircular vertical molten<br>
metal injection grooves 901 and 902 and the chamber 55A is injected into the<br>
casting space that is formed by a combination of the fixed mold 7 and the<br>
movable mold 8.<br>
At this time, the molten metal 180A is first moved in the horizontal direction<br>
against the ground, preferably in the horizontal direction along the molten metal<br>
injection pipe 9 that is downwardly slanted toward the sleeve 62. The molten<br>
metal 180A is then introduced into the semicircular vertical molten metal<br>
injection grooves 901 and 902 located right under the casting space and the<br>
chamber 55A without forming a turbulent flow. Continuously, the molten metal<br>
180A is injected into the casting space in the vertical direction by means of the<br>
operation of the follower plunger 11A, as shown in FIG. 5. At this time, the fixed<br>
mold 7 and the movable mold 8 are vertically disposed. Thus, the molten metal<br>
180A can be introduced into the casting space smoothly without generating a<br>
turbulent flow. Accordingly, bubbles can be prevented from occurring and the<br>
product 191A with fine structure and no bubbles can be produced continually.<br>
The mold fixing plates 70 and 70A, the molten metal injection pipe 9, the sleeve<br>
62 and the like are fastened with bolts 17A. It is to be noted that the present<br>
invention is not limited to the above but may be modified without the gist of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Furthermore, referring to FIGS. 9 to 12, a die casting machine according to the<br>
present invention includes a pair of supports 2 and 3 that are disposed in the<br>
opposite direction on a machine body 1, a guide rod 5 that connects the<br>
supports 2 and 3 to guide a movable support plate 4, and the movable support<br>
plate 4 movably fixed to the guide rod 5, wherein the plate 4 is moved along the<br>
guide rod 5 by means of a piston rod 6A of a first cylinder 6 fixed to one of the<br>
supports 2 and 3.<br>
A movable mold 8 and a mold fixing plate 70A for fastening the movable mold 8<br>
are disposed on one side of the movable support plate 4 and a second cylinder<br>
124A is fixed on the other side of the movable support plate 4. A tablet 65 to<br>
which an ejector pin 67 for pushing a shaped product 91A from the movable<br>
mold 8 is fixed is integrally fixed to a piston rod 120A of the second cylinder<br>
124A. A molten metal injection pipe 9 and a mold fixing plate 70 are fixed on one<br>
side of the other one of the supports 2 and 3. A fixed mold 7 having a molten<br>
metal guide hole 91A formed therein is fixed to the mold fixing plate 70. A<br>
support rod 68 is fixed on the other side of the other one of the supports 2 and<br>
3. Further, an additional support plate 131A is disposed at the end of the support<br>
rod 68. A third cylinder 10 is fixed to the support plate 131A, so that a plunger<br>
10A of the third cylinder 10 pushes the molten metal into the molten metal<br>
injection pipe 9. Thus, the metal cast within the casting space formed by the<br>
fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8 according to the shape of the casting<br>
space.<br>
The die casting machine further includes a vacuum tank 13 in which a vacuum<br>
apparatus is connected to a vacuum pump 41; a material injection pipe 40 for<br>
injecting a material 47 into the vacuum tank 13; two or more valves 30 and 35<br>
disposed in the material injection pipe 40 for precluding air from introducing into<br>
the vacuum tank 13 while the material 47 is injected; a fifth cylinder 45 that<br>
makes a plunger 45A follow it, for supplying the material 47 into the vacuum<br>
tank 13 via the material injection pipe 40; a melted liquid crucible 23 disposed<br>
within the vacuum tank 13 for melting the material 47; a rack 29 and a pinion 27<br>
for making the melted liquid crucible 23 inclined in order to supply a melting<br>
metal 180A that is melted within the melted liquid crucible 23 toward the molten<br>
metal injection pipe 9 by rotating the melted liquid crucible 23; a molten metal<br>
outflow hole 13A formed at the bottom of the vacuum tank 13 for introducing<br>
the molten metal 180A discharged from the melted liquid crucible 23 into the<br>
molten metal injection pipe 9; and a plate valve 16 disposed at a lower side of<br>
the vacuum tank 13 for opening and shutting the molten metal outflow hole 13A.<br>
In the above, a plughole 31A through which the plunger 45A for pushing the<br>
material 47 is formed in a plate valve 31 within the valve 30 of the two or more<br>
valves 30 and 35 fixed to the material injection pipe 40.<br>
In other words, in the casting method using an alloy of a high melting point, in<br>
order to preclude the alloy that is easily oxidized by oxygen in air from oxygen in<br>
air and thus to produce a product of a high quality in a vacuum state, the<br>
vacuum apparatus is connected to the molten metal injection pipe 9 of the die<br>
casting machine. While keeping a good vacuum state even when the material 47<br>
is injected into the vacuum apparatus, the material is melted under a vacuum<br>
condition within the vacuum apparatus and is then cast within the evacuated<br>
casting space formed by the fixed mold 7 and the movable mold 8 via the molten<br>
metal injection pipe 9. Accordingly, an alloy product of a high melting point and a<br>
high quality can be produced.<br>
In the die casting machine having the vacuum apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, the plate valve 16 is movably inserted into the pair of valve<br>
body 15B that are fastened with the bolts 48 at an entrance 9A portion of the<br>
molten metal injection pipe 9. The plate valve 16 is at one with the molten metal<br>
outflow hole 15A of the valve 15, which is opened and shut by a piston rod 19A<br>
of the cylinder 19 fixed to the support plate 18 that is supported by the support<br>
rod 17.<br>
Meanwhile, the molten metal outflow hole 13A of the vacuum tank 13 is disposed<br>
in accord with the molten metal outflow hole 15A. The vacuum tank is sealed by<br>
a cover 14 having an air exhaust pipe 14A formed therein. A housing 20 in which<br>
a hollow shaft 21 is rotatably disposed is fixed to one side of the vacuum tank<br>
13. A furnace support 22 is fixed to the end of the hollow shaft 21 located within<br>
the vacuum tank 13 and a melted liquid crucible 23 of a kettle shape in which a<br>
hole 23A is formed is disposed. A high frequency induction coil 24 is wound on<br>
the melted liquid crucible 23. An induction coil coolant circulating pipe 26 and a<br>
power supply cable 24A are inserted into the hollow shaft 21. The pinion 27 fixed<br>
to the hollow shaft 21 is geared with the rack 29 formed in the piston rod of the<br>
cylinder 28 to rotate the hollow shaft 21.<br>
Furthermore, the plate valve 31 having the plughole 31A formed therein is<br>
movably inserted into the pair of the valve body 30B having the material<br>
injection hole 30A formed therein on the other side of the vacuum tank 13.<br>
Thereby, a valve 30 whose plate valve 31 is opened and shut by means of an up-<br>
and-down motion of a piston rod 34A of a sixth cylinder 34 that is fixed to a<br>
support plate 33 supported by a support rod 32, and a plate valve 36 are<br>
movably inserted into the pair of the valve body 35B in which a material injection<br>
hole 35A is formed. A valve 35 whose plate valve 36 is opened and shut by a<br>
piston rod 39A of a seventh cylinder 39 fixed to a support plate 38 supported by<br>
a support rod 37, and a material injection pipe 40 having an air exhaust pipe 40A<br>
formed therein are connected. The air exhaust pipe 40A is connected to the<br>
vacuum pump 41. A material guide plate 42 fixed to the valve 35 are disposed<br>
within the vacuum tank 13. The fifth cylinder 45 is fixed to a support plate 44 of<br>
a support rod 43 fixed to the valve 30, so that the material 47 moved by the<br>
conveyor 46 is injected into the vacuum tank 13 by means of the plunger 45A of<br>
the fifth cylinder 45.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIG. 12, if the material is transferred in front of the valve<br>
30 through a conveyor 46, the sixth cylinder 34 is driven to make the piston rod<br>
34A follow it, thus lifting up the plate valve 31 of the valve 30 to open the valve<br>
30. Thereafter, the fifth cylinder 45 is driven to make the plunger 45A follow it,<br>
so that the material 47 is inserted into the material injection pipe 40 by means of<br>
the plunger 45A. Next, as shown in FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, the plunger 45A is first<br>
moved backward. The plate valve 31 of the valve 30 is then lowered down to<br>
shut the valve 30. Then, the plunger 45A is moved forward again through the<br>
plughole 31A that is formed in the plate valve 31 of the valve 30. Thus, the<br>
plughole 31A formed in the plate valve 31 within the valve 30 is clogged with the<br>
plunger 45A.<br>
In this state, similarly, the cylinder 39 is driven to make the piston rod 39A follow<br>
it, thus lifting up the plate valve 36 to open the valve 35. The plunger 45A is<br>
moved forward so that the material 47 reaches the material guide plate 42.<br>
Through a subsequent operation, the materials 47 are injected into the melted<br>
liquid crucible 23 one by one and are then melt. Thereafter, the plunger 45A is<br>
moved backward so that the end of the plunger 45A is located at the middle of<br>
the material injection pipe 40, preferably between the valve 35 and the valve 30.<br>
After the valve 35 is shut, the plunger 45A is moved backward so that the<br>
plunger 45A exits the plughole 31A formed in the plate valve 31 of the valve 30.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, after the plunger 45A is continuously moved backward, the<br>
plate valve 31 of the valve 30 is lifted up in opposition so that the material 47 is<br>
injected again. Accordingly, before and after the material 47 is injected as well as<br>
while the material 47 is injected, the vacuum tank 13 is not fully opened in a<br>
standby state. It is thus possible to keep the interior of the vacuum tank 13 at a<br>
high vacuum state.<br>
According to the present invention constructed above, the movable support plate<br>
4 fixed to the piston rod 6A of the first cylinder 6 is moved toward the support 3<br>
to adhere the movable mold 8 to the fixed mold 7. Air is exhausted by means of<br>
air exhaust pipes 7A and 8A and a vacuum pump 12. Thus, The vacuum state of<br>
the casting space formed by a combination of the fixed mold 7 and the movable<br>
mold 8 keeps lower than the atmospheric pressure. The molten metal 180A that<br>
is drained from the vacuum tank 13 by means of the plunger 10A of the third<br>
cylinder 10 is transferred along the molten metal injection pipe 9 in the<br>
horizontal direction. Next, the molten metal 180A is vertically transferred to the<br>
evacuated casting space that is formed by a combination of the fixed mold 7 and<br>
the movable mold 8 by means of the follower plunger 11A of the fourth cylinder<br>
11 and is then cast within the casting space.<br>
The plate valves 31 and 36 of the valves 30 and 35 that are fixed to the material<br>
injection pipe 40 pass through the material 47 while they are opened and shut<br>
alternately. However, the vacuum tank 13 connected to the material injection<br>
pipe 40 makes at least one of the two valves 30 and 35 shut. Thus, since the<br>
valve is completely prevented from being exposed to air, the interior of the<br>
vacuum tank 13 is always kept at a high vacuum state. In a state where the two<br>
valves 30 and 35 are shut, air within the material injection pipe 40 is exhausted<br>
via the air exhaust pipe 40A formed in the material injection pipe 40 by means of<br>
the vacuum pump 41, keeping the interior of the vacuum tank 13 evacuated.<br>
Accordingly, after air that was introduced along with the introduction of the<br>
material 47 is removed, a high vacuum state is kept although the valve 35<br>
connected to the vacuum tank 13 is opened. Thereafter, the plate valve 36 of<br>
the valve 35 is raised to open the material injection hole 35A. The material 47<br>
within the material injection pipe 40 is pushed toward the plunger 45A, injected<br>
into the melted liquid crucible 23 of a kettle shape within the vacuum tank 13<br>
and then melted.<br>
At this time, three materials 47 are disposed on the material guide plate 42 and<br>
are then preheated. By supplying next materials 47, the materials are<br>
sequentially injected into melted liquid crucible 23 one by one. Also, the melted<br>
liquid crucible 23 is formed in a size that can melt several materials 47. If the<br>
molten metal 180A of the melted liquid crucible 23 is to be introduced into the<br>
entrance 9A of an existing molten metal injection pipe 9 by means of the high<br>
frequency induction coil 24, the plate valve 16 of the valve 15 is moved to open<br>
the molten metal outflow hole 15A. The pinion 27 and the hollow shaft 21 are<br>
rotated by the rack 29 of the cylinder 28 to make the melted liquid crucible 23<br>
inclined. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 15, the molten metal 180A can be injected<br>
into the molten metal injection pipe 9 through the molten metal outflow hole 13A<br>
of the vacuum tank 13, the molten metal outflow hole 15A of the valve 15, and<br>
the entrance 9A.<br>
In the above, the amount of fusion of the material 47 of the melted liquid<br>
crucible 23 can be several times as high as the internal volume of the mold. This<br>
corresponds to the amount the material 47 that can form about 1 to 10 products.<br>
The melted liquid crucible 23 is formed in a kettle shape. Thus, when the molten<br>
metal is dumped, it is drained through the hole 23A, as shown in FIG. 15.<br>
Impurities such as slag floated on the melted liquid crucible 23 are prevented<br>
from being exhausted through the hole 23A.<br>
The aforementioned operation has been described based on one time product<br>
manufacturing process. Products can be mass-produced by repeating the<br>
operation.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the present invention, a fixed mold and a movable mold are<br>
disposed vertically and a molten metal is moved horizontally. The molten metal is<br>
then moved to a plunger so that flows into a chamber. After a molten metal<br>
injection hole of the fixed mold is sealed by the plunger, the molten metal is<br>
moved vertically by a follower plunger and is inserted into a mold that is<br>
disposed vertically. Therefore, the present invention has effects that the density<br>
and mechanical strength are high since minute bubbles are not generated due to<br>
occurrence of a turbulent flow, a product of a good quality whose surface is<br>
smooth is obtained and the yield of a product requiring high quality is improved.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, a vacuum apparatus is<br>
connected to a molten metal injection pipe of a die casting machine. Even while<br>
a material is injected into the vacuum apparatus, the material is melted within<br>
the vacuum apparatus under vacuum while always keeping a good vacuum state.<br>
Thus, the material is cast within a evacuated casting space formed by a fixed<br>
mold and a movable mold through a molten metal injection pipe. Accordingly,<br>
the present invention has an effect that it can fabricate an alloy product of a<br>
good quality and a high melting point.<br>
