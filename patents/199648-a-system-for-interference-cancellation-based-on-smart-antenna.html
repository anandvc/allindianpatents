				<td>METHOD OF INTERFERENCE CANCELLATION BASED<br>
ON SMART ANTENNA<br>
Field of the Technology<br>
The present invention relates generally to a wireless communication technology, and more particularly to a cancellation processing technology of interference in wireless base station with smart antenna or in user terminal.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In modern wireless communication system, especially in CDMA wireless communication system, in order to raise system capacity, to raise system sensitivity and to have farther communication distance with lower emission power, smart antenna is used, in general.<br>
In the Chinese patent named "Time Division Duplex Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Communication System with Smart Antenna" (CN 97 1 04039.7), a base station structure of wireless communication system with smart antenna is disclosed. It includes antenna array consisted of one or plural antenna units, corresponding radio frequency feeder cables and a set of coherent radio frequency transceivers. According to each antenna unit's different response to signal, coming from user terminal, baseband processor gets space characteristic vector and direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal; then with correspondence algorithm, receiving antenna beam forming is implemented. Among them, any antenna unit, corresponding radio frequency feeder cable and coherent radio frequency transceiver together is called a link. By using weight, which is got from up link receiving beam forming of each link, for down link transmitting beam forming, whole functionality of smart antenna can be implemented, under symmetrical radio wave propagation.<br>
The main part of modern wireless communication system is mobile communication. As mobile communication is working at a complex and variable environment (reference to ITU proposal M1225), severe influences of time-varying and multipath propagation have to be considered. In the patent said above and many disclosed technical documents concerning about beam forming algorithm of smart<br><br>
antenna, the conclusion is more functionality will be with more algorithm complexity. Nevertheless, under mobile communication environment, beam forming must be completed in real time, and algorithm-completed time is microsecond level. As limitation of modern microelectronic technology, digital signal processing (DSP) or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) cannot implement too complex real time processing within such short time period.<br>
Facing with the conflict said above, a simple maximum power composite algorithm, pointed to mobile communication system with code division multiple access, is used; it is not only simple, but also can solve time delay of multipath component composition within a chip width. Nevertheless, in modern CDMA mobile communication system under mobile environment, time delay of multipath propagation component is larger, amplitude of multipath propagation component is higher, so interference is still severe. This means under this mobile communication environment, simple and real time beam forming algorithm of smart antenna not only cannot solve the multipath propagation interference problem, but also cannot thoroughly solve system capacity problem of CDMA mobile communication system.<br>
On the other hand, in order to solve interference problem of multipath propagation, people deeply study technologies such as Rake receiver and Joint Detection or said Multi User Detection and use them in mobile communication system of Code Division Multiple Access. Nevertheless, the Rake receiver or multiuser detection technology, said above, cannot be directly used in mobile communication system with smart antenna. The main reasons are: technology, based on Rake receiver or multiuser detection principle, processes CDMA signal of multi-code channel, composes or cancels main multipath components; but smart antenna technology makes beam forming pointed to each CDMA code channel separately, then after passing channel estimation and matched filter, signals of all users are once solved directly by inverting matrix.<br>
There is a two-dimensional smart antenna technology, but it is in a research stage and its algorithm is immature and complex.<br>
There is another method which processes multiuser detection after using smart antenna; but at this time as each code channel has been separated, processing<br><br>
multiuser detection must be separated for each code channel; the result is that not only cannot fully bring multiuser detection function into play, but also greatly increase complexity of baseband signal processing.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In order to have higher system capacity and better performance for CDMA wireless communication system, it is necessary to search for a simple and real time interference cancellation method convenient for being used in CDMA wireless communication based on smart antenna.<br>
Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a interference cancellation method based on smart antenna, while CDMA mobile communication or other mobile communication system uses smart antenna and simple maximum power composite algorithm; interference problem, produced by multipath propagation etc., can be solved and a better effect can be got.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a set of new digital signal processing methods, which can be used in CDMA mobile communication system or other mobile communication system, to make the mobile communication system can solve interference of various multipath propagation etc., while using smart antenna.<br>
The invention of an interference cancellation method based on smart antenna, comprising:<br>
A.	with beam forming matrix, getting from real time beam forming algorithm,<br>
making beam forming for output digital signal of a receiver based on smart antenna,<br>
then getting a set of digital signal, represented as NRk(m), after beam forming, where k<br>
representing code channel and m representing sample point;<br>
B.	canceling other users main path signal included in the set of digital signal<br>
NRk(m) after beam forming, getting another set of digital signal, represented as<br>
NSk(m), which only includes needed signal and all interference signal, where k<br>
representing code channel and m representing sample point;<br>
C.	searching   in   digital   signal  NRk(m)   and  getting  all   multipath   signal<br>
distributed on formed beam direction;<br>
D.	canceling multipath interference signal coming from other users in digital<br>
signal NRk(m);<br><br>
E. superposing main path and multiple path signal of working user terminal in phase coincidence, getting a digital signal with interference canceled.<br>
In the said step A, output digital signal of a receiver based on smart antenna is in sample level.<br>
The said step A is performed in a base band signal processor, comprising: synchronizing and eliminating over sample for output digital signal of a receiver based on smart antenna; de-scrambling, de-spreading and dividing it into each code channel signal; forming receiving beam of every link with beam forming composite algorithm in beam former, and getting composite result.<br>
The said beam forming algorithm is a maximum power composite algorithm.<br>
The said step A further comprises: demodulating smart antenna output signal, outputted by beam former, and detecting signal-to-noise ratio of training sequence; when the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than threshold value, the receiving data is directly outputted and the procedure is ended; when the signal-to-noise ratio is less than threshold value, succeeding steps are executed.<br>
The said step B further comprises: solving main path of signal, which comes from other terminal users and is in the formed beam of working code channel; making spread spectrum for it, adding scrambling code to it and recovering it to a sample level digital signal; subtracting other users main path signal whose energy is greater than threshold value from the said digital signal NRk(m) and getting the said NRk(m).<br>
The said solving main path of signal, which comes from other terminal users and is in formed beam of the working code channel, is to solve other code channels signal voltage level in the working code channel beam.<br>
The said step C further comprises: moving sample point position individually within one symbol and getting multiple sets chip level signal; solving correlation for them with known scrambling code and getting multiple sets output with energy greater than threshold value; adding known scrambling code to the output and recovering multipath interference of multiple sets with sample level; subtracting multipath interference, coming from other user, from digital signal NRk(m) got in step<br><br>
B, superposing main path and multipath signal of kth channel in phase coincidence and getting the kth channel sample value after interference cancellation; de-scrambling, de-spreading and demodulating sample value of kth channel, then getting the kth channel signal after interference cancellation, where k is any positive integer.<br>
The said searching in step C is only taken within one symbol, searching times needed equal to sample numbers, within each chip, times spread spectrum coefficient then minus 1.<br>
The said step D further comprises: subtracting interference digital signal, coming from other terminal users, from digital signal NRk(m) got at step B to cancel multipath interference signal coming from other terminal users.<br>
The said step D is taken on sample level, and signals concerned are converted to sample level signal.<br>
The said step E further comprises: with canceling sample value of main path and multipath interference signal, coming from other users, getting each chip value; after de-scrambling and de-spreading with kth spread spectrum code, superposing main path and multipath signal coming from working terminal user in phase coincidence, then getting outputting signal after interference cancellation; after demodulating, getting needed result after interference cancellation.<br>
The said steps A, B, C, D and E cancel interference for all channel whose signal-to-noise ratio is less than threshold value.<br>
The said steps A, B, C, D and E are used for interference cancellation in mobile communication base station; the said steps B, C, D and E are used for interference cancellation in user terminal.<br>
In method of the invention, for CDMA mobile communication system having longer training sequence (Pilot or Midamble) in frame designed structure, as in real mobile communication system not all working code channels are severely influenced by multipath propagation etc., so signal quality can be pre-detected at smart antenna output, i.e., detecting signal-to-noise ratio (error code) in receiving training sequence (Pilot or Midamble); for channels there is no error code or numbers of error code are<br><br>
less than set value, then further processing is not needed, in this way numbers of thannel needed to be further processed is greatly decreased and complexity of base band signal processing is greatly degraded.<br>
In method of the invention, for CDMA mobile communication system having no longer training sequence (Pilot or Midamble) in frame designed structure, or for CDMA mobile communication system having longer training sequence (Pilot or Midamble) in frame designed structure but there are severe interference and severe error code channels, then it is necessary to use method of the invention to cancel multipath interference in order to have correct receiving.<br>
Method of the invention proposes a simple maximum power composite algorithm, which makes beam forming in symbolic level and can be operated in real time.<br>
Using new multipath interference cancellation technology proposed by the invention, most of multipath interference coming from this channel or other channels is canceled (multipath interference that is not canceled, has time delay with integer multiple of symbol width, but its appearing probability is low), so interference influence of multipath propagation etc. is canceled in a maximum limit and purpose of correct receiving is reached. Calculation volume of the invention is limited, with present commercial DSP it can be implemented thoroughly.<br>
Although method of the invention points to mobile communication system with CDMA, but after simple variance it can be completely used in mobile communication system with frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA).<br>

Embodiments of the invention<br>
With embodiment and drawings, technology of the invention is described in detail in the following.<br>
Referencing to Fig. 1, it shows a typical base station structure of wireless communication system such as mobile communication system or wireless user loop system etc. which with smart antenna It mainly includes N identical antenna units 201A, 201B, ..., 201N; N almost identical radio frequency feeder cables 202A, 202B,.., 202N; N radio frequency transceivers 203A, 203B, ..., 203N and a baseband signal processor 204. All radio frequency transceivers 203A, 203B, ..., 203N use a same local oscillator 208 to guarantee that each radio frequency transceiver works in coherence.<br>
All radio frequency transceivers 203A, 203B, ..., 203N have Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC), so input and output signals of baseband signal processor 204 are all digital signal; radio frequency transceivers 203A, 203B, ..., 203N are connected with baseband signal processor 204 by a high speed digital bus 209.<br>
Basic working principle of base station with smart antenna and working method of smart antenna have been described in the Chinese patent named "Time Division Duplex Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Communication System with Smart Antenna" (CN 97 1 04039.7), interference cancellation method for smart antenna receiving signal of the invention is also implemented in the base station structure. The invention does not make any changes of smart antenna working principle and characteristics, also the invention does not discuss transmitting signal processing and it only describes interference cancellation method for receiving signal.<br>
Referencing to Fig. 1 and steps 301 to 304 of Fig. 3, under base station structure, shown in Fig. 1, smart antenna working mode, implemented in baseband signal processor 204, is described. Suppose the CDMA wireless communication system is consisted of K code channels, and the smart antenna system consist of N antenna<br><br>
units, N radio frequency feeder cables and N radio frequency transceivers, then receiving link is taken as an example for description.<br>
Step 301: after receiving signal, from antenna unit 201i, it is converted by analogy to digital (ADC), and sampled by ith radio frequency transceiver 203i, it outputs a digital signal, known as st(m), where m is mth sampling point; step 302: after digital signal si(m) is synchronized and its over-sampling is eliminated by blocks 210, then a chip level digital signal is got, known as slj(n), where n represents nth chip; step 303: after chip level digital signal sl(n) is de-scrambled and de-spread by block 205, then it is separated into K numbers of code channel symbolic level signal, known as Xki(l), where / represents lth' symbol; step 304: the K numbers of code channel symbolic level signal pass K beam formers 206, respectively, with certain beam forming composite algorithm, the ith link receiving beam is formed and its composite result is got, it is represented as:<br>
where k = 1, 2, ..., K; wik(l) is beam forming coefficient of kth code channel in ith link, when using maximum power composite algorithm,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Xki*(l) is conjugate of complex number xki(l), therefore beam forming matrix Wk with symbolic level is got, where Rk(l) is the output of smart antenna system.<br>
In time division duplex (TDD) system, when up link (base station receiving) beam is formed, weight of each link can be directly used to down link (base station transmitting) beam forming, in this way advantage of smart antenna is fully got. After output Rk(l), said above, is processed by such as demodulation etc., receiving signal can be got.<br>
Referencing to Fig. 2 and 3, they show interference needed to be cancelled in base station of CDMA system with smart antenna, and new signal processing method related to the invention.<br>
Step 306, smart antenna system output signal Rk(l), outputted by baseband signal processor 204, is demodulated and signal/noise ratio of its training sequence is detected (training sequence in any mobile communication system is known, it can be got by a comparison) by K demodulation units 207A, 207B, ..., 207K and K signal/noise ratio (S/N) detection units 221A, 221B, ..., 221K; if the signal/noise ratio of output signal is greater than preset threshold (Fig. 3 step 307 and Fig. 2 diamond block), it means in corresponding code channel there is no error code or number of error code is less than set value, then step 308 can be executed: the receiving signal is directly outputted, received data is outputted and processing is ended; if the signal/noise ratio of output signal is less than preset threshold (Fig. 3 step 307 and Fig. 2 diamond block), then step 305 is executed: go to the next signal processing stage (if there is no training sequence in wireless communication system, then there is no need to detect signal/noise ratio in step 306 and 307).<br>
Step 305, getting the input digital signal NRk(m) after beam forming, this is carried out in blocks 222A, 222B, ..., 222K. First, suppose processed code channel is the code channel used by kth user terminal, with got kth code channel beam forming matrix wik(l), beam forming of received digital signal is made directly and a set of new data NRk(m) is formed:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where k = 1, 2, ..., X"; wik is mean value of kth code channel beam forming matrix within one frame, it is: where L is symbol number needed to be counted, obviously L must be less or equal to symbol numbers of one frame; definition of wik(l) is in formula (1); Sj(m) is multiple channel CDMA signal received by ith link, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The got new data signal NRk(m) is sent to K multipath processors 223A, 223B, ..., 223K, it is processed with the new processing method of the invention; the processing procedure mainly includes: first step consists of steps 310 and 312, second<br>
step consists of step 314, third step consists of step 316 and fourth step consists of step 318; as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
First step: cancel main path component comes from other users, it is included in signal level of kth beam of input digital signal NRk(m) after beam forming, its processing procedure is:<br>
1) Calculate all other main path signal in kth beam, calculate other code channel signal level, which is in working code channel kth beam, i.e. calculate<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where v = 1,2, ..., K, other code channel total power in kth code channel is<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Fv*(l) is conjugate of complex number Fv(l), L is symbol numbers needed to be counted, obviously L should be less or equal to the symbol numbers of one frame. Then, compare pv with threshold value set by the system, if there are U number of values are greater than threshold, called U number of signals needed to be cancelled, then it means that there are U number of signals cannot be cancelled by spatial filter of smart antenna. For Ith symbol, this signal output can be represented as FU(l).<br>
Making spread spectrum for Fu(l) with uth spread spectrum code and getting the spread spectrum signal fu(n) after spread spectrum, solve mean amplitude, in kth link, of each signal needed to be cancelled:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where Ru(l) has been solved by formula (1), u = 1,2, ..., U.<br>
Again, make spread spectrum for this signal and put the known scramble code on it, then its input digital signal is recovered:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
2) In NRk(m), canceling other main path signals, then NSk(m) is got. Subtract interference from total input digital signal after beam forming, then input digital signal after beam forming, which only includes the needed code channel (kth channel) and all multipath interference, can be got:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Operations above are going on sampled level, signal s2u(n) should be transformed to sampled level, form s2u(m), here, it can be considered that every sampled value is evenly distributed.<br>
Step 2, search and solve all multipath components in NSk(m). Search multipath components distributed on this formed beam direction; the searching is performed in the digital signal NSk(m) formed above, each time move one sample point m and get a new set slkj(n)\ with known scramble code pn_code(n), correlated ykj(n) is got on symbol level and its total energy is calculated:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where M' - M - 1, and M is number of all chips for counted L symbols. In the above formula, only T numbers of interference whose energy exceeds threshold value are retained, then scramble ykt(n) with known scramble code pn_code(n) and get tth interference value in input data s3kjn):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Obviously, the searching is only made within one symbol, searching numbers needed equal to sample numbers in each chip times SF - 1, where SF is spread spectrum coefficient.<br>
Step 3, cancel multipath signal. In NSk(m), cancel multipath signals coming from other user and get SSk(m). Subtract interference data signals exceeding threshold value from input data signal NSk(m) getting at step 2, then multipath interference signals coming from other users are canceled:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The operation is going on at sample level, s3kt(n) should be transformed to sample level to form s3kt(m), here, it can be considered that each sample value is evenly distributed.<br>
Step 4, get output RSk(l) after interference cancellation. From sample value SSk(m), in which multipath interference signals from other users have been canceled, each chip level digital signal value s4k(n) is got; main path signal of kth code channel is superposed with multipath signal, in phase coincidence, then with de-scrambling and de-spread spectrum using kth spread spectrum code, output signal RSk(l) after interference canceled can be got.<br>
Further, demodulate in step 320, a result after interference cancellation is finally got; data is outputted and procedure is ended at step 308.<br>
Obviously, the process said above should be done for the entire code channel which have error code, i.e. the process said above should be done K times (signal-to-noise ratio greater than threshold value) to achieve the purpose of canceling interference for all code channel.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, it shows CDMA user terminal structure using method of the invention. It includes antenna 401, radio transceiver 402, analog to digital converter 403, digital to analog converter 404 and baseband signal processor 405. A method of the invention will be implemented in baseband signal processor 405.<br>
In this structure, output of analog to digital converter 403 can be directly used for input digital signal NRk(m) mentioned above, then interference cancellation is made by first step to fourth step mentioned above. During first step, which cancels main path signals coming from other users, those main path signals Fv(l) can be directly got by de-scrambling and de-spreading without using formula (5) mentioned above and it starts directly from formula (6) mentioned above.<br>
In the invention method, beam forming is carried out at base station; when the invention method is used at user terminal, receiving signal received by user terminal itself is the mentioned digital signal NRk(m) after beam forming; according to<br>
numbers of code channel k needed to be received by user terminal, with the four steps mentioned above, interference cancellation can be proceeded.<br>
Although technology scheme of the invention mainly points to CDMA mobile communication system, but after simple variance it can be completely used in mobile communication system with frequency division multiple access and time division multiple access. Any technician, whose career is research and development, radio communication system, after understanding principle of smart antenna and basic knowledge of digital signal processing, can design high quality smart antenna system according to the method proposed by the invention, and use it in various mobile communication system or radio user loop system.<br>
The method of the invention is also a new digital signal processing method, which can be used in CDMA mobile communication system or other radio communication system; it makes the system uses smart antenna and at the same time interference of various multiple path propagation is canceled and have a better result.<br>
Although an embodiment of the invention is described here, but obviously without leaving spirit and scope of the invention there are many variances.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
