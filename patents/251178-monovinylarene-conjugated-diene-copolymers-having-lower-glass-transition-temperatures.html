				<td>Back ground Art<br>
The present invention relates generally to the fields of polymer chemistry. More particularly, it concerns monovinylarene- conjugated diene copolymers with lower Tg relative to reference styrene-butadiene copolymers<br>
Articles formed from monovimlarene-conjugated diene copolymers, such as styrene-butadiene copolymers, for example K-Resin® (Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., The Woodlands. TX), generally have a number of good physical properties. However, in the case of articles for which heal shrink is a desirable processing step, monovinylarene-conjugated diene copolymers are generally slightly less favorable for use, as their glass transition temperatures (Tg), which is the temperature at which shrinking occurs, arc typically in the range of about 95°C to about 108°C.   This relatively high Tg requires the use of a relatively large amount of heat to reach the temperatures at which shrinking occurs.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to have monovinylarene-butadiene copolymers with lower Tg and more ready heat shrink proeessibility.<br>

Best Made for Carrying Out the Invantion<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a diene  block copolymer compnsing<br>
a random (conjugated diene/.monovinylareney)m block, wherein x is about 2.5 wt% to about 10 wt%, y is from about 90 wr% to about 97.5 wt%, and x i y  is about 97.5 wt% to 100 wt%: and<br>
a (conjugated diene)n block;<br>
wherein n is from about 20 wt% to about 30 wt%, m is from about 70 wt% to about 80 wt%. and m + n is from about 90 wt% to 100 wt%.<br>
The basic starting materials and polymerization conditions for preparing conjugated diene/monovinylarene block copolymers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,091,053: 4,584,346; 4,704,434; 4,704.435; and 5.227,419; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
"Conjugated diene,'" as used herein, refers to an organic compound containing onjugated carbon-carbon double bonds and a total of 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Exemplary conjugated dienes include, but arc not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, 2-mcthyi-l,3-butadiene, 2-ethyl-1,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-buiadiene, 1,3-pentadiene, 3-butyl-l,3-octadiene, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the conjugated diene con be 1,3-butadiene or isoprene. In a further embodiment, the conjugated diene can be 1,3-butadiene. A unit of a polymer, wherein the unit is derived from polymerization of a conjugate diene monomer, is a "conjugated diene unit.'"<br>
"Monovinylarene," as used herein, refers to an organic compound containing a single carbon-carbon double bond, at least one aromatic moiety, and a total of 8 to 18 carbon atoms, such as 8 to 12 carbon atoms. Exemplary mono vinyl are nes include, but are not limited to, styrene, alpha-methylsryrene, 2-methylstyrene, 3-methylstyrene, 4-methylsryrene. 2-elhylstyrene, 3-ethylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-n-propylstyrenc, 4-t-butylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene. 4-cyclohexylstyrene, 4-decylstyrene, 2-ethyl-4-ben7.ylslyrene, 4-{4-phenyl-n-butyhstyrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 2-vinylnaphthalene, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the monovinylarenc is styrene. A unit of a polymer, v. herein the unit is derived from polymerization of a monovinylarene monomer, is a "monovinylarene unit."<br>
In the polymer of the present invention, the random (conjugated<br>
dienex/monovinylareney)m block comprises conjugated diene units and monovinylarene units. The block is "random" in that the probability of any particular unit being a conjugated diene unit or a monovinylarene unit is substantially the same as the mole fractions of conjugated diene and monovinylarene in the block.  This does not preclude the possibility of short<br>
stretches of the block having regularity (i.e., appearing non-random), hut such regular stretches will typically be present at no more than about the level expected by chance.<br>
In the random (conjugated dienex/monovinylareney)rr, block, the conjugated diene units can be present at a weight fraction x, wherein x can be about 2.5 wt% to about 10 wt%, and the monovinylarene units can be present at a weight fraction y, wherein y can be from about 90 wt% to about 97.5 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment, x can be about 5 xvt% to about 10 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment, y can be about 90 wt% to about 95 wt%.<br>
As will be apparent to the skilled artisan, x + y can be less than or equal to 100 wt%. In one embodiment, x + y can be about 97.5 wt% to 100 wt%.<br>
In the event that x + y is less than 100 wt%, the balance of the weight fraction of the random (conjugated dienex/monovinylareneyjm block can comprise one or more other units. Any other units that arc capable of inclusion in a polymer by vinyl addition polymerization can be the other units providing the balance of the weight fraction of the random (conjugated enex/monovinylarenev)m block.<br>
The (conjugated diene)n block comprises conjugated diene units, and can also comprise a Miiall amount (less than about 1 wt%) of one or more other units. Any other units that are capable of inclusion in a polymer by vinyl addition polymeri/ation can be the other units comprising the small amount of the (conjugated diene)n block<br>
The proportions of the random (conjugated dienex/monovinylareney)m block and the (conjugated diene)n block can be defined by their weight fractions, m and n.<br>
In one embodiment, n can be from about 5 wt% to about 45 wt% and m can be from about 55 \vt% to about 95 wt%. In a further embodiment, n can be from about 20 wt% to about 30 wt% and m can be from about 70 wt% to about 80 wt%. In another embodiment, n can be about 25 wt% and m can he about 75 wt%.<br>
As will be apparent to the skilled artisan, m + n can be less than or equal to 100 wt%. In one embodiment, m + n can be from about 90 wt% to 100 ul%.<br>
In the event that m •* n is less than 100 \vt%. the balance of the weight fraction of the i, opolvmer can comprise one or more other blocks. Any other blocks that are eapable of inclusion in a block e&gt;&gt;poKmcr b\ vinyl addition polymerization can he the other blocks moviding the balance, of the wenght  fraction of the copohaicr. An example of such a block is. : iii i- not limited in  a pol\ ir&gt;ono\ invlareue block.<br>
I he inventive polymer contains at least one random (conjugated<br>
dienex/monovinylareney)m block and at least one (conjugated diene),, block. The blocks can be incorporated sequentially into the polymer in any order. The inventive polymer can contain more than one random (conjugated dienex/monovinylarency)m block, more than one (conjugated diene)n block, or both. If a plurality of either or both type of block is present, the blocks can be incorporated sequentially into the polymer in any order (e.g., alternating between the random block and the conjugated diene block, or present in a sequence of blocks of one type followed by a sequence of blocks of another type, among other incorporation sequences).<br>
Generally, each block is formed by polymerizing the monomer or mixture of monomers from which the desired units of the block are derived. The polyrnerizxUion process will generally be amenable to a relative lack of change in process parameters between different blocks, but the skilled artisan, having the benefit of the present disclosure, may make some minor changes in process parameters between different blocks as a matter of routine experimentation.  Hie following descriptions of the polymerization process will generally apply to the formation of all types of blocks in the inventive polymer, although certain descriptions may be of more or less value to forming one or more of the types of blocks in the inventive polymer.The polymerization process can be carried out in a hydrocarbon diluent at any suitable temperature in the range of from about -100°C to about 150°C, such as from about 0°C to about 150°C, and at a pressure sufficient to maintain the reaction mixture substantially in the liquid phase. In one embodiment, the hydrocarbon diluent can be a linear or cyclic paraffin, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary linear or cyclic paraffins include, but are not limited to, pentane, hexane. octane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and mixtures thereof, among others   In one embodiment, the paraffin is cyclohexane.<br>
The polymerization process can be carried out in the substantial absence of oxygen and vsaler, such as under an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The polymerization process can be performed in the presence of an initiator. In one embodiment, the initiator can be any organomonoalkali metal compound known for use as an initiator   In a further embodiment, the initiator can have the formula RM, wherein R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl. or aryl radical containing 4 to 8 carbon atoms, such as an n-butyl radical, and<br>
M is an alkali metal, such as lithium. In a particular embodiment the initiator is n-butyl lithium.<br>
The amount of initiator employed depends upon the desired polymer or block molecular weight, as is known in the art and is readily determinahle. making due allowance for traces of poisons in the feed streams. In one embodiment, the initiator can be present in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 phm (parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total monomer) to about 1,0 phm   In another embodiment, the initiator can be present in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 phm to about 0.5 phm. In a further embodiment, the initiator can be present in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 phm to 0.2 phm.<br>
The polymerization process can further involve the inclusion of small amounts of randomizers. In one embodiment, the randomizer can be a polar organic compound, such as an ether, a thioether, or a tertiary amine. In another embodiment, the randomizer can be a potassium salt or a sodium salt of an alcohol. The randomizer can be included in the hydrocarbon diluent to improve the effectiveness of the initiator, to randomize at least part of the monovinylarene monomer in a mixed monomer charge, or both. The inclusion of a randomizer can be of value when forming a random (conjugated dienex/'monovinylarene)m block of the present polymer. Exemplary randomizers include, but arc not limited to, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, ethyl methyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-octyl ether, anisole, dioxane, 1.2-dimetboxyethane, dibenzyl ether, diphenyl ether. 1,2-dimcthoxybenzene, tetramethylene oxide (tetrahydromran or THF), potassium tert-amyhue (KTA), dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfidc, di-n-propyl sulfide, di-n-butyl sulfide. methyl ethyl sulfide. dimethylelhylamine, tri-n-ethylamine. tri-n-propylamine. tri-n-butylamine, trimethylanine, triethylarnine, tetramethylethylenediamine, tetraethylethylenediamine, N,N-di-methylanilinc, -methyl-N-ethylaniline, N-methylmorpholine, and mixtures thereof, among others.<br>
In one embodiment, the randomizer is tetrahydrofuran. When employing tctrahydrofuran, the tetrahydrofuran is generally present in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 phm to about 1.0 phm. such as from about 0.02 phm to about 1.0 phm.<br>
In another embodiment, the randomizer is potassium tert-amylate (K I A)   When employing KTA. the KTA is generally present in an amount in the ranee of from about 0.01 phm to about 1.0 phm. Mich as from about 0.1 phm to about 1.0 phm<br>
When forming a particular block, each monomer charge or monomer mixture charge is polvnierized under solution poly men/ation conditions such that the peyl inen/ntion of each<br>
monomer charge or monomer mixture charge, to form the particular block, is substantially complete before charging a subsequent charge. "Charging," as used herein, refers lo the introduction of a compound to a reaction zone, such as the interior of a reactor vessel.<br>
A coupling agent can be added after polymerization is complete. Suitable coupling agents include, bur are not limited to, di- or multivinylarcnc compounds; di- or rnultiepoxides; di- or multiisocyauaict di- or multiimines; di- or multialdehydes; di- or multiketones; alkoxytin compounds; di- or multihalides, such as silicon halides and halosilanes; mono-, di-. or multianhydi ides, di- or multiesters, such as ihc esters of monoalcohols with polycarboxylic acids; diestcrs which are esters of monohydric alcohols with dicarboxylic acids: diesters which are esters of monobasic acids with polyalcohols such as glvcerol; and mixtures of two or more such compounds, among others.<br>
Useful multifunctional coupling agents include, but are not limited to, epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soybean oil, epoxidized linseed oil, and mixtures thereof, among others   In one embodiment, the coupling agent is epoxidized soybean oil. Epoxidized vegetable oils arc commercially available under the tradename Vikoflex® from Atofina Chemicals (Philadelphia, PA).<br>
Any effective amount of the coupling agent can be employed. In one embodiment, a stoichiometric amount of the coupling agent relative to active polymer alkali metal tends to promote maximum coupling. However, more or less than stoichiometric amounts can be used for varying coupling efficiency where desired for particular products. Typically the total amount of coupling agent employed in the polymerization is in the range of from about 0 1 phm to about 20 phm. such as from about 0.1 phm to about 5 phm, or from about 0.1 phm to about 2 phm.<br>
Following completion of the coupling reaction, the polymerization reaction mixture can be treated with a terminating agent such as water, alcohol, phenols, or linear saturated aliphatic mono-dicarboxylic acids, to remove alkali metal from the block copolymer and for color control. In one embodiment, the terminating agent is a mixture of water and carbon dioxide.<br>
Aftei termination, the polymer cement (polymer in polymerization solvent) usually (-oiituins about 10 to 4d weight percent solids, more usuallv 20 to 35 weight percent solid1. The polymer ceme:il ian be Hashed to evaporate a pmtion ol the solvent so a;, lo increase ilu- <br>
solids content to a concentration of about 50 to about 99 weight percent solids, followed by vacuum oven or devolatilizing extruder drying to remove the remaining solvent.<br>
The block copolymer can be recovered and worked into a desired shape, such as by milling, extrusion, or injection molding. The block copolymer can also contain additives such as antioxidants, antiblocking agents, release agents, fillers, extenders, and dyes, and the like.<br>
In specific polymerization processes, typical initiator, monomer and monomer mixture charge sequences include, but are not limited, to the following.<br>

A monovmylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer of the present invention can have a Tg of at least about 10°C less than the Te of a reference polymer differing only in x being about 0 wt% and y being about 100 wt%.<br>
Tg is the glass transition temperature of a polymer, i.e., the temperature below which the polymer is in a relatively hard and brittle glass-like state, and above which the polymer is in a relatively soft and flexible plastic-like state. Tg can be measured by known techniques and apparatus, such as differential sqmning calorimetry (DSC). Each polymer inherently has a glass transition temperature.<br>
A reference polymer, as used herein, is a polymer identical to a<br>
nionovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer of the present invention, in terms of the block identities and the values of rn and n. The reference polymer differs only in x being about 0 wt% and y being about 100 wt% (i.e.. instead of a random (conjugated dienex/monovinylarenev),n block, the reference polymer has a block that consists essentially of rnonovinylarene).<br>
As stated above, in one embodiment, the monovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer of the present invention can have a Tg at least about 10°C less than the Tg of the reference polymer. In another embodiment, the monovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer can have a To at least about 20°C less than the Tg of the reference polymer. In a further embodiment, the monovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer can have a Tg at least about 30°C less than the Tr of the reference polymer.<br>
Such lower Tg allows easier processing of monovinylarene/conjugated diene c.opolymers to form shrink films, among other articles.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to an article, comprising the monovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer described above.<br>
The article can be any article which can be fabricated, in whole or in part, from a monovinylnrene/eonjugated diene block copolymer known in the art. such as thelo<br>
styrene/butadienc copolymer available under the tradenanie K-Resin® (Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., The Woodlands, TX).<br>
Exemplary articles include, but are not limited to, containers, medical packaging, medical devices, toys, garment hangers, and flexible and rigid packaging, among others.<br>
In one embodiment, the article is a shrink film, defined as a film that can shrink upon exposure to temperatures of about 60°C to about 80°C.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a monovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer having a low T,,. comprising.charging a rnonovinylarene monomer, a conjugated diene monomer, an initiator,<br>
and a randomizer, allowing polymerizing to occur, to produce a reaction mixture comprising a<br>
random (conjugated dienex/monovinylareney)ni block;<br>
(a)	charging an initiator and a conjugated diene monomer, and allowing polymerization<br>
to occur, to produce a reaction mixture comprising a (conjugated diene)n block; and<br>
(b)	charging the reaction mixture with a coupling agent, to form<br>
monovinylarene/conjugated diene block copolymer.<br>
The charging steps (a)-(c) can be performed in accordance with the description set forth above. The proportions of the various components to be added in each of the charging steps is a matter of routine experimentation to the skilled artisan having benefit of the present disclosure.<br>

Example 2:<br><br>
(Table Removed)In addition to the above, each charge after the initial cyclohexane charge was followed with 0.2 Ib cyclohexane (total cyclohexane at end of run was 9.0 Ib).<br>
In both examples, at S min after the final charge, the contents of the reaction vessel were transferred to a blowdown vessel containing 3 g Be Square Wax (added before preheating of the blowdown vessel). The reactor and all lines were rinsed with 0.5 Ib c\clohe.\ane, and the rinse was transferred to the blowdown vessel. The hlowdown vessel was then heated to 1 78°C, and the polymer was flashed to yield a polymer rope. The polymer rope \s as dried in a vacuum me;: 
Comparative Example 3: Synthesis of Reference Polymer<br><br>
(Table Removed)In addition to the above, each charge after the initial cyclohexane charge was followed with 0.2 Ib cyclohexane (total cyclohexane at end of run was 9.0 Ib).<br>
After the reaction, the polymer was retrieved and processed by the same procedure described for Examples 1-2, above.<br>
Examples 4-5 and Comparative Example 6: T£ of both random (conjugated dienex/monovinvjareneyj,n/(coniugated diene)  block copolvmers and a reference polymer<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on the polymers generated in Examples 1-2. and a comparative reference polymer having styrene blocks of essentially the same number and weight as the random butadiene/sty rene blocks of the polymers of Examples 1-2. The Tg of each polymer was detennined through standard techniques for analysis of heat flow vs. temperature graphs generated by DSC.<br>
Example 4<br>
The polymer of Example 1 was subjected to DSC    1 he results are shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
The polymer of Example 2 was subjected to DSC. The results are shown in Figure 2. The Tgwas63.96°C.<br>
(Comparative Example 6<br>
The reference polymer of Comparative Examples 3 was subjected to DSC. The result? are shown in Figure 3. The Tg was 95.50°C.<br>
The results of Examples 4-5 and Comparative Example 6 indicate that the substitution of about 5-10 wt% butadiene into the styrene blocks of a butadiene/styrene block copolymer resulted in reductions in the Tg of at least about 10°C, such as about 20°C or 30°C, relative to the reference polymer.<br>
