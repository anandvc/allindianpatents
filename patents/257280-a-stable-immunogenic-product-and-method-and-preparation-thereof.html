				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to stable immunogenic products comprising immunogenic protein heterocomplexes for obtaining a humoral immune response with production of specific antibodies raised against one ore more antigens, in particular against a « self » antigen, as well as their use in the field of vaccines. Prior art<br>
Obtaining a high level antibody response from a given antibody, in an individual, is an object commonly sought, whether the antigen is a « foreign » antigen or a « self » antigen.<br>
However, the problem of a good recognition of the antigen against which an antibody response is being sought, in an individual, should be solved in a number of cases; more particularly (a) when the antigen of<br>
interest behaves like a « hapten », i.e. a low molecular mass chemical structure which is little or not immunogenic under a free form, but that, once fixed on a high molecular mass molecule, is able to induce the production of specific antibodies of such a hapten, and (b) when the antigen of interest is a self protein, i.e. a protein being naturally produced in the individual, for which there exists an immune tolerance due to the deletion of corresponding lymphocyte T clones, during the development of the immune system.<br>
In order to cause, or increase, the recognition of an antigen of interest by B cells, various immunogenic constructions were developed in the state of the art.<br>
A first immunogenic construction form comprises a covalent coupling of the antigen of interest on a carrier molecule, the carrier molecule bringing structures recognized by the auxiliary T lymphocytes (« T helper » cells), in association with class II molecules of the Histocompatibility Major Complex (HMC), and activating the auxiliary T lymphocytes then producing various cytokins, amongst which IL-2, said cytokins activating in turn the specific B cell clones of the antigen of interest. The specific B cells of the antigen of interest, once activated,<br>
multiply and produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest, which is the objective being sought. Generally, such a type of immunogenic constructions comprises products of the covalent chemical coupling between the antigen of interest and the carrier molecule, which, after purification and removal steps of the non coupled products, are final products with a well defined chemical structure.<br>
The first form of an immunogenic construction is for example illustrated by the article by Richard and al. describing the preparation of products of the covalent coupling between IL-9 and ovalbumin (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 97(2): 767-772). It is also illustrated in such US Patent 6,340,461 (Terman) which discloses coupling products between one or more copies of an antigen of interest, against which a specific antibody response is being sought in an individual, and a carrier molecule consisting in a « Superantigen ». The antigen of interest is coupled exclusively covalently to the carrier molecule, for example, by means of glutaraldehyde (also called « pentanedial »), the non covalently coupled products being removed in order to obtain a chemically well defined final product.<br>
Optionally, the product from the covalent coupling between the antigen of interest and the superantigen could be prepared in the form of a polymer of said coupling product, for example, through a non covalent bond of the monomelic coupling products between one another, through ionic interactions, adsorption interactions as well as biospecific interactions. For example, the monomeric coupling products could form complexes with highly positively or negatively charged molecules, through salt bridges produced in low ionic strength conditions. Larges complexes of monomeric coupling products are prepared using charged polymers such as poly(L-glutamic acid) or poly(L-lysine) polymers. According to another embodiment of a monomeric coupling product polymer, the exclusively covalent coupling products between the antigen of interest and the superantigen could be adsorbed or coupled non covalently at the surface of microparticles, such as latex beads or other hydrophobic polymers.<br>
A second embodiment of such immunogenic constructions commonly called « MAP » structure (for « Multi-Antigenic Protein ») generally have the form of a protein backbone comprised of a linear or branched, poly(lysine) polymer, onto which one or more antigens of interest<br>
are covalently bound.<br>
A third embodiment of such immunogenic constructions consists in microparticles onto which fixed the antigen(s) of interest is/are bound. Various forms of antigen carrier microparticles are known.<br>
Are known, for example, iscomes (for «immunostimulating complexes ») comprised of an antigenic complex and an adjuvant, the QuilA compound.<br>
Liposomes are also known having the same inconvenients as the iscomes, i.e. more particularly some toxicity and immunological side effects, due to their lack of purity.<br>
Biodegradable microparticles are also known such as lactic acid and glutamic acid polymers (Aguado and Lambert, 1992, Immuno. Biol., Vol. 184: 113-125) as well as starch particles (US Patent Application 2002/0098203 - Gutavsson et al.), in the polymeric matrix of which antigens of interest are trapped. Such particles release the antigen under their soluble form during the degradation of the polymeric matrix.<br>
Particles have also been disclosed exclusively comprised of hybrid<br>
recombinant proteins, as disclosed in French Patent Application FR 2,635, 532 (Thiollais et al).<br>
Porous microspheres are also known wherein the antigens are immobilized within micropores through captation or physical coupling, as disclosed in the US Patent 5,008,116 (Cahn).<br>
However, the various solutions suggested in the state of the art share in common at least one technical inconvenient related to their preparation method, i.e. the loss of a high proportion of the antigenic material of interest, due to a necessary step for removing the non coupled on non adsorbed antigens.<br>
Moreover, while the prior art techniques allow to provide an association between the low molecular mass antigen of interest with a carrier molecule, they are generally not adapted to coupling a high molecular mass antigen of interest, for example, of more than 10 kDa, with the carrier molecule, because, in particular, of steric hindrances preventing coupling a high number of molecules of antigens of interest having a high molecular mass with an identical carrier molecule.<br>
Finally, most if not all the known peptide antigenic constructions<br>
encompass in their structure a single carrier molecule, which is a technical inconvenient when the objective is to induce a preventive or therapeutic immune response both against the antigen of interest and the carrier molecule itself.<br>
There is therefore a need in the state of the art for improved immunogenic constructions allowing for the production of a high level of antibodies specific to an antigen of interest in an individual where such a humoral immune response is sought, being less expensive, simple to prepare and able to be synthetized reproducibly. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides new immunogenic constructions allowing to solve the various technical problems encountered with the immunogenic constructions as known in the prior art and allowing to meet the above-described various technical needs.<br>

The invention provides new immunogenic constructions inducing a high level of production of antibodies specific to an antigen of interest, in an individual. The immunogenic protein heterocomplexes according to the invention<br>
It has been shown according to the invention that the production of a high level of antibodies specific to an antigen of interest could be obtained, in an individual, through the immunization of such an individual with an immunogenic product where said antigen of interest is associated with a carrier protein molecule, the association between said antigen of interest and said carrier protein being partially covalent and partially non covalent.<br>
More specifically, it has been shown according to the invention that an excellent antibody response raised against an antigen of interest is obtained when an individual is being immunized with a stable immunogenic product comprising protein heterocomplexes, wherein the heterocomplexes comprise stable associations between antigen of interest and said carrier protein molecule and wherein only a low proportion of such associations is due to a covalent bond between the antigen of interest and the carrier protein molecule, the other associations between the antigen of interest and the carrier protein molecule being produced by weak bonds, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, etc.<br>
In particular, it has been shown according to the invention that an optimum antibody response is reached when, in a stable immunogenic product such as described hereinabove, less than 40% of the molecules of the antigen of interest are covalently linked to the carrier protein molecules. According to the invention, an antigenic molecule of interest is covalently linked to a carrier protein molecule by « one » covalent bond means that said molecule of antigen of interest is covalently linked, chemically, to said carrier protein molecule, by at least one covalent bond, i.e. optionally by two covalent bonds or more.<br>
The percentage of carrier protein molecules and of antigenic protein<br>
proteins of interest linked between one another through covalent bonds in an immunogenic product of the invention can be easily checked by the man of the art.<br>
For example, determining the percentage of antigenic molecules of interest linked to the carrier protein molecules through a covalent link in an immunogenic product of the invention could be made using the following steps of:<br>
(i) submitting said immunogenic product in solution to denaturing and reducing conditions;<br>
(ii) performing a size exclusion chromatography step with the product as obtained at the end of step (ii) during which the various protein components with decreasing molecular mass are successively eluted from the size exclusion chromatography support;<br>
(iii) measuring the amount of antigen of interest linked through a covalent bond to the carrier molecule in the eluate fraction containing the protein components with the highest molecular mass;<br>
(iv) comparing the amount of antigen of interest measured in step (iii) with the total amount of antigen of interest initially included in the starting immunogenic product.<br>
In step (i) of the method for determining the above-described covalent link percentage, incubating a given amount (in number of moles or in weight) of the immunogenic product of the invention under denaturing and reducing conditions leads to a disassociation of the weak bonds between the various protein components not linked between one another through a covalent bond.<br>
Amongst preferred denaturing conditions there is the presence of urea, for example, in the final 8M concentration, or the presence of SDS, for example, in the 1% final concentration in total weight of the solution containing the immunogenic product. Amongst preferred reducing conditions there is the presence of |3-mercaptoethanol, for example in the 5% final concentration of the total volume of the solution containing the immunogenic product.<br>
In step (ii) of the method for determining the percentage of molecules of antigen of interest and molecule of carrier protein linked between   one   another   through   covalent   bonds,   the   size   exclusion<br>
chromatography support is selected by the man of the art according to his technical general knowledge. For example, the man of the art could make use of chromatographic supports as marketed by the Pharmacia Corporation under the « Superdex 75™ » and « Superdex 200™ » trade marks.<br>
In step (ii), the molecular fraction corresponding to the carrier molecule covalently linked to the molecules of antigen of interest is eluted first, before the eluate fraction(s) containing the antigen of interest under a free form. The antigen of interest being eluted under a free form corresponds to the fraction of the antigen of interest, which was not covalently linked to the carrier molecule, within the starting immunogenic product. It is on the high molecular mass protein fraction that occurs the measurement of the amount of the antigen of interest covalently linked to the carrier protein molecule, for example, in an immuno-enzyme test, in a radioimmunologic test or in an immunofluorescence test, either direct or indirect (« sandwich »), using antibodies specific to the antigen of interest and which do not have any immunologic reaction crossed with the carrier protein molecule.<br>
In step (iii), the amount of the antigen of interest covalently linked with the carrier protein molecule, being measured as described hereinabove, is compared with the initial amount of the antigen of interest being included in the given amount (in number of moles or in weight) of the starting immunogenic product and the percentage of the antigen of interest is thereby calculated, which is covalently linked to the carrier protein molecule, in the immunogenic product of the invention.<br>
The percentage of carrier protein molecules and of antigenic protein proteins of interest linked between one another through covalent bonds, in an immunogenic product of the invention, can be easily checked by the man of the art, making use of a second method comprising the following steps of:<br>
a)	immobilizing on a support of specifically antibodies raised against the carrier protein;<br>
b)	brinding into contact the antibodies raised against the carrier protein, which were immobilized on the support in step a), with a known amount of molecules of the immunogenic product to be tested comprising said carrier protein and an antigenic protein of interest;<br>
c)	removing the molecules of the immunogenic product which are not linked to the anti-carrier protein antibodies immobilized in step a), by means of a buffering aqueous solution comprising one ore more protein denaturing agents;<br>
d)	dl) bringing into contact (i) immunogenic complexes formed in step c) between the immobilized anti-carrier protein antibodies and the molecules of the immunogenic product with (ii) antibodies specifically raised against the carrier protein;<br>
d2) separately from step dl), briging into contact the immunogenic complexes formed in step c) between the immobilized anti-carrying protein antibodies and the molecules of the immunogenic product with (ii) antibodies specifically raised against the antigenic protein of interest;<br>
e)	el) quantifying the antibodies added in step dl) having been<br>
linked to the carrier protein;<br>
e2) quantifying the antibodies added in step d2) having been linked to the antigenic protein;<br>
f)	calculating the ratio between:<br>
(i) the amount of anti-carrier protein bound antibodies measured in step el); and<br>
(ii) the amount of anti-carrier protein bound antibodies measured in step e2),<br>
said ratio consisting in the proportion of carrier protein molecules and antigenic protein molecules of interest being linked between one another through covalent bonds, within the starting immunogenic product.<br>
In step c) of the above described method, the use of an aqueous washing solution containing one or more protein denaturing agents leads to a denaturation of the immunogenic product linked to the anti-carrier protein antibodies, resulting in the release, in the washing solution, of antigenic protein molecules of interest which are not covalently linked to the carrier protein molecules. Therefore, in step d2) of the method, only the antigenic protein molecules of interest being covalently linked to the carrier protein molecules are quantified.<br>
Preferably, the denaturing buffering solution used in step c) contains a surfactant such as Tween®20, in a final concentration of 0.1 %<br>
v/v.<br>
in steps dl) and d2), the amounts of bound antibodies are preferably measured through incubating antigen-antibodies complexes formed at the end of each of said steps with a new antibody being labelled through a detectable molecule, respectively:<br>
(i) in step dl), a new antibody directed against an the anti-carrier protein antibody and labelled with a detectable molecule;<br>
(ii) in step d2), a new antibody directed against an antibody anti-antigeni protein of interest and labelled with a detectable molecule.<br>
The detectable molecule is indiscriminately either a radioactive molecule, a fluorescent molecule or an enzyme. As an enzyme, peroxydase could more particularly be used, its presence being revealed through colorimetry, after incubation with the ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate.<br>
A detailed protocol of the above-mentioned method is described in the examples.<br>
By way of illustration, it has been shown according to the invention, using the first or the second above described quantification methods that:<br>
-	in the immunogenic product comprising heterocomplexes between the KLH carrier molecule and human alpha interferon molecules, from 3 to 8% of the alpha interferon molecules are covalently linked to the KLH carrier protein molecule;<br>
-	in the immunogenic product comprising the heterocomplexes between the KLH carrier protein molecule and murine IL-4 molecules, about 11% of the IL-4 molecules are covalently linked to the KLH carrier protein molecule.<br>
Obviously, depending on the preparations, the percentage of molecules of antigenic protein of interest covalently linked to the carrier protein molecules could significantly vary. However, in all cases, such a percentage is always lower than 40%.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a stable immunogenic product for inducing antibodies raised against one or more antigenic proteins in a subject, characterized in that it comprises protein immunogenic   heterocomplexes   comprising   associations   between   (i)<br>
antigenic protein molecules and (ii) carrier protein molecules and in that less than 40% of the antigenic proteins (i) are covalently linked to carrier protein molecules (ii).<br>
Another object of the invention is also to provide an immunogenic product comprising stable protein immunogenic heterocomplexes for inducing antibodies raised against one or more antigenic proteins in a subject, each heterocomplex comprising (i) a plurality of antigenic proteins, linked to a (ii) carrier protein molecule, characterized in that less than 40% of the antigenic proteins (i) are covalently linked to carrier protein molecules (ii).<br>
Most preferably, the antibodies with their production being induced by the immunogenic product of the invention comprise « neutralizing » or « blocking » antibodies. A « neutralizing » or a « blocking » antibody is defined, according to the invention, as an antibody the binding of which on the native protein blocks the biological activity of such a native protein, which is an important objective being sought by the invention, when the native protein against which the antibodies are raised has a deleterious biological activity for the organism, within the targeted pathological context of an individual to be treated, for example, when the native protein has an angiogenic activity, an immunosuppressive activity, as well as an allergenic activity, more particularly an interleukin-4 production inducing activity.<br>
A « carrier protein molecule », included in the immunogenic product of the invention, means any protein or peptide being at least 15 amino acids long, whatever its amino acid sequence, and which, when partially covalently being associated to the molecules of the antigen of interest for forming protein heterocomplexes making up the immunogenic product of the invention, allows for a large number of molecules of the antigen of interest to be presented to the B lymphocytes.<br>
According to a first aspect, the carrier protein molecule consists in one protein or one peptide being at least 15 amino acid long, or also an oligomer of such a peptide, comprising one or more auxiliary T epitopes ("helper") able to activate auxiliary T lymphocytes ("T helper") of the host organism for producing cytokins, including interleukin 2, such cytokins, in turn, activating and inducing the proliferation of B lymphocytes, which, after maturation, will produce antibodies raised against the antigenic protein<br>
 (i).<br>
According to a second aspect, a carrier protein molecule consists in one protein or one peptide being at least 15 amino acid long, or also an oligomer of such a peptide, comprising besides one or more auxiliary T epitopes ("helper"), as described in the above-mentioned first aspect, one or more cytotoxic T epitopes, able to induce a cell immune response through the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific of the carrier protein molecule, such lymphocytes being able to specifically recognize cells expressing on their surface said carrier protein or any peptide being derived therefrom, in association with class 1 Histocompatibility Major Complex (HMC) molecules. If need be, the carrier protein molecule consists in one oligomer of one protein or one peptide, further comprising be'sides one or more T helper epitopes, one or more above defined cytotoxic T epitopes.<br>
According to a third aspect, a carrier protein molecule consists in one protein or one peptide being at least 15 amino acid long, as well as one oligomer of such a peptide, comprising besides one or more auxiliary T epitopes ("helper") as defined in the first aspect, one or more B epitopes, able to induce the production of antibodies by lymphocytes raised against the carrier protein.<br>
In some embodiments, the carrier protein, besides its T helper, used for activating an antibody response against the antigen of interest, could also activate a cytotoxic respone against cells carrier peptides of the carrier and/or stimulate an antibody response against such a carrier protein molecule.<br>
The carrier protein molecule could also consist in a homo-oligomer or a homo-polymer of the native protein, from which it is derived, as well as a homo-oligomer or a homo-polymer of a peptide fragment of the native protein, from which it is derived. The antigenic protein of interest could also consist in a hetero-oligomer or a hetero-polymer comprising a combination of several distinct peptide fragments initially included in the native protein from which it is derived.<br>
As used herein, the expression « antigenic protein » means any protein or any peptide being at least 10 amino acid long, including a hapten peptide, able to be specifically recognized by receptors for the antigens expressed by the B lymphocytes of a host organism, whether human or<br>
animal, more particularly a mammal, such antigenic protein, once included in an immunogenic product of the invention, stimulating the production of antibodies recognizing said antigenic protein.<br>
It is meant under « antigenic protein » any protein comprising one or more B epitopes of the native antigenic protein against which the production of antibodies if being sought. Said antigenic molecule of interest could consist in the native protein itself or a protein derivate of the native protein, such as a peptide fragment of the native protein, as well as any biologically inactivated form of the native protein obtained through chemical, physical treatment or genetic mutation. The antigenic molecule of interest could also consist in a homo-oligomer or a homo-polymer of the native protein as well as a homo-oligomer or a homo-polymer of a peptide fragment of the native protein. The antigenic protein of interest could also consist in a hetero-oligomer or a hetero-polymer comprising a combination of several distinct peptide fragments initially included in the native protein.<br>
In an immunogenic product according to the invention, advantageously, less than 30% and preferably less than 20% of antigenic proteins (i) are covalently linked to the carrier protein molecules (ii).<br>
In an immunogenic product according to the invention, advantageously, at least 1%, and preferably at least 2%, of the antigenic proteins (i) are covalently linked to the carrier molecules (ii).<br>
It has been shown that an immunogenic product according to the invention, such as hereinabove defined, is stable in an aqueous solution. The stability of an immunogenic product of the invention is more particularly characterized in that said immunogenic product has its own isoelectric point, distinct from the isoelectric point of at least one of its protein components, respectively the antigenic protein (i) and the carrier protein molecule (ii), and in that it therefore migrates according to a distinct protein strip from at least one of its protein strips respectively corresponding to both protein components making it up in isoelectrofocusing trials.<br>
It has also been shown, through immunoblotting trials (« Western blot »), that the immunogenic product of the invention migrates in an electrophorese gel, under non denaturating conditions, according to a single protein strip, which illustrates the fact that said immunogenic product has<br>
the form of a homogeneous population of soluble protein constructions.<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that the antigenic protein (i) as well as the protein molecule (ii) included under the form of protein heterocomplexes in the immunogenic product of the invention were both recognized by antibodies specifically recognizing each of such proteins. Thus, the immunogenic product according to the invention comprises the antigenic protein (i) and the carrier protein molecule (ii) in their native structure. Such a technical feature of the immunogenic product according to the invention is particularly advantageous for inducing an immune response against native antigens, i.e. an efficient and truly protective immune response of the host organism. It has been more particularly shown that an immunogenic product according to the invention induces, in the host organism to which it is administered, the induction of a strong efficient humoral response against native antigens, associated to the production of neutralizing or blocking antibodies, towards the deleterious biological activity of such native antigens.<br>
It has been shown according to the invention, with various antigens of interest, that the humoral immune response obtained using an immunogenic product such as defined hereinabove, was 10 to 1000 times higher than the humoral immune response obtained with the administration of a conventional covalent conjugate between the antigen of interest and the carrier protein molecule.<br>
Preferably, in an immunogenic heterocomplex included in the immunogenic product of the invention, the plurality of antigenic proteins (i) is made up of a plurality of specimens of a single antigenic protein.<br>
Thus, according to a most preferred embodiment, the immunogenic product of the invention is implemented for obtaining specific antibodies raised against a single antigen of interest.<br>
It has also been shown according to the invention that an immunogenic product comprising immunogenic heterocomplexes such as hereinabove defined, is particularly well adapted to the immunization of an individual, through the production of antibodies, against a « self antigen » of interest, i.e. against a protein being naturally produced by said individual, for which there exists a tolerance of the immune system, in particular an at least partial deletion of auxiliary lymphocyte T clones (T<br>
helper cells) specifically recognizing said antigen.<br>
In other words, the presentation of the « self » antigen to the cells of said individual's immune system, under the form of an immunogenic product comprising immunogenic heterocomplexes of the invention, allows to « break » the tolerance of the individual's immune system towards such an antigen. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, the Applicant believes that the opportunity to obtain a high level of antibody response against a « self » antibody is due to the presence within the heterocomplex of numerous epitopes of the « auxiliary T » type (or T helper) carried by the carrier protein molecule, activating the auxiliary T lymphocytes, and the various cytokins produced by the activated auxiliary T lymphocytes, including IL-2, allows to promote some activation of the B cells to « self » antigens present in the latent state within the organism, and to thereby break the immune tolerance of B cells to « self » antigens.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment, the immunogenic<br>
product of the invention is characterized in that the antigenic proteins (i)<br>
consists in a plurality of specimens of a protein being normally recognized<br>
as a self protein by the cells of said subject's immune system.	<br>
As the major proportion, more than 60%, of associations between the antigen of interest and the carrier protein molecule, occurs through non covalent interactions, there exists no other theoretical limitation in the number of molecules of the antigen of interest associated with a single carrier protein molecule, than the steric availability of the molecules of the antigen of interest to such a carrier molecule. In particular, the number of molecules of the antigen of interest associated to a single carrier protein molecule is not limited by the number of chemically reactive functions carried by the carrier molecule allowing for creating covalent links with a plurality of molecules of the antigen of interest. Consequently, the only physical limitation seems to be the number of sites of the carrier protein molecule (ii) available to the antigenic protein (i).<br>
For the same reasons, the size of the antigen of interest to be associated to the carrier protein molecule is not either strictly limited, the antigen of interest consequently being able to consist in full proteins of at least 10 kDa, such as the various cytokins, as IL-4, IL-10, VEGF as well as the alpha interferon.<br>
Moreover, even for the antigens of interest consisting in full proteins with a molecular mass higher than 10 kDa, an immunogenic heterocomplex of the invention can comprise an association of several antigens of interest on a single carrier molecule, if the size of the carrier molecule makes it possible.<br>
When the carrier protein molecule has a small size, for example a size lower than 10 kDa, or even lower than 5 kDa, the Applicant believes, without wishing to be bound to any theory, that the partially covalent associations between the antigen of interest and said carrier protein, forming the protein heterocomplexes included in the immunogenic product of the invention, allow for such a conformation of heterocomplexes that both the antigen of interest and the carrier protein molecule are available to receptors of the immune system cells.<br>
This is even an additional technical advantage provided to the immunogenic product comprising heterocomplexes such as hereinabove defined, as the presentation to B lymphocytes of a plurality of specimens on one single carrier molecule, included in the heterocomplex, enhances the « capping » phenomenon through « cross-linking » of receptors of the B cell recognizing the antigen, contributing to the activation of the B cell receiving, in addition, activation signals coming from cytokins produced by the activated auxiliary T lymphocytes activated by means of auxiliary T epitopes carried by carrier protein molecule.<br>
Thus, according to a most preferred embodiment of the immunogenic product, the latter comprises 5 to 50 antigenic proteins (i) for one carrier protein molecule (ii), preferably 20 to 40 antigenic proteins (i) for one carrier protein molecule (ii).<br>
The number of molecules of the antigen of interest on one single carrier protein molecule respectively depends on the size of the carrier molecule and on the size of the molecule of the antigen of interest. The bigger the carrier molecule is and offers a large association surface with the antigen of interest, the more the immunogenic heterocomplex will comprise, for one single of the carrier molecules it contains, a higher number of specimens of the molecule of the antigen of interest. Similarly, the more reduced the size of the molecule of the antigen of interest is, the larger the number of specimens will be of the molecule of the antigen of<br>
interest on the same carrier molecule.<br>
By way of illustration, it has been shown according to the invention that when the carrier protein molecule is KLH, 20 to 40 molecules of IL-4, IL-10, alpha interferon or VEGF are associated to each carrier molecule.<br>
It has been shown that the solubility of the immunogenic product in an aqueous solution varies with the modification of the balances mastering the molecular interactions within heterocomplexes, more particularly the electrochemical balances depending on the so-called « weak » (non covalent) links as well as the respective concentrations in antigenic proteins and the carrier protein molecule, as well as with the conditions of ionic strength, pH and temperature.<br>
Preferably, the covalent bonds between one or more antigenic proteins (i) and the carrier protein molecule (ii) occur by means of a bifunctional bonding chemical agent.<br>
Such a chemical agent could be cyanogen bromide, glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide or succinic anhydride.<br>
As for carbodimides, the following compounds could be used: 1-<br>
cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4-ethyl)carbodiimide (CMC), l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethyaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and l-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-<br>
limethylpentyl)carbodiimide,	l-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-(4-ethyl)-<br>
carbodiimide,(l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) and l-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide.<br>
As homo-bifunctional coupling agents, the following compounds could be used:<br>
-	N-hydroxysuccinimide, dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate) esters,<br>
disuccinimidyl suberate, and disuccinimidyl tartrate; bifunctional<br>
imidoesters dimethyl adipimidate, dimethyl pimelimidate, and dimethyl<br>
suberimidate;<br>
-reagents	with	a	sulphydryl,	l,4-di-[3'-(2'-<br>
pyridyledithio)propionamido]butane, bismaleimidohexane, and bis-N-maleimido-1, 8-octane;<br>
-	bifunctional halides of the aryl type and 4,4'-difluoro-3,3'-dinitropheny lsulfone;<br>
-	SMCC	(succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-l-carboxylate);<br>
-	SIAB (N-succinimidyl(4-iodoacetyl)aminobenzoate);<br>
-	SMPB (succinimidyl-4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate);<br>
-	GMBS (N-(.gamma.-maleimidobutyryloxy)succinimide ester);<br>
-	MPBH (4-(4-N-maleimidophenyl) hydrazide butyric acid);<br>
-	M2C2H (4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-l-carboxyl-hydrazide);<br>
-	SMPT (succinimidyloxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pyridyl-dithio)toluene); and<br>
-	SPDP (N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate).<br>
Preferably, the bonding chemical agent to be used comprises at<br>
least two reactive aldehyde functions.<br>
Most preferably, the bonding chemical agent is glutaraldehyde.<br>
After the product comprising protein heterocomplexes has been formed through a coupling of carrier protein molecules with antigenic proteins with the use of the bonding chemical agent, the resulting product could be stabilized by means of a protein stabilizing agent, such as formaldehyde, able to create intrachain bonds.<br>
The immunogenic products comprising immunogenic heterocomplexes of the invention have the form of microparticles soluble in solution, in particular in an aqueous solution, their average size varying depending on (i) the size of the carrier protein molecule, (ii) the size and the number of antigenic proteins associated to one single carrier protein molecule and (iii) the number of carrier molecules associated to the antigenic proteins present in a heterocomplex particle.<br>
It has been found that the heterocomplex microparticles described in the examples have an average size ranging from 100 nm to 300 nm.<br>
Most preferably, an immunogenic product comprising immunogenic protein heterocomplexes of the invention exclusively comprises carrier molecules associated to antigenic proteins, with the exclusion of any other material. More particularly, a heterocomplex of the invention does not comprise any other polymeric, proteinaceous or non proteinaceous material, other than the carrier and antigenic proteins characterizing it.<br>
Recently, ZAGURY D et al. (2001, Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA. 98(14):8024-8029), in a bibliographical study, suggested to induce an anti-<br>
cytokin immunity in patients in order to counteract the abnormal production in such pathologies of some cytokins, including interleukins, lymphokins, monokins, interferons, physiologically acting in the tissues, locally as a factor of programmed cell proliferation, differentiation, or death.<br>
The above-mentioned authors state that the strategies of vaccine therapy were, until now, exclusively focused on the antigenic aggressor, whether it is a micro-organism, a cell or an allergen, but never attempted to fight the deregulation of cytokins induced under the effect of the aggressor. Said authors suggest an anti-cytokin vaccination as a prior step to a conventional vaccination having as an aim to neutralize or block the immunotoxic effect of the stroma, and to allow for the normal occurrence of the immune reaction adapted towards the antigenic aggressor.<br>
Moreover, the Applicant's prior work, mentioned in the International Application published under WO 00/03732, showed that in the case of ATL leukemia, the neck of the uterus cancer and the Kaposi sarcoma, respectively, three proteins are involved in a local immunosuppression at the level of tumors or HIV1 infected cells:<br>
the HTLV1 virus Tax protein,<br>
the papillomavirus E7 protein, and<br>
the V1H-1 virus Tat protein.<br>
The Applicant also stated that some of such immunosuppressive proteins, such as the HIV1 Tat protein and the HPV E7 protein (Strains 16 and 18) also have activating effects on vascular endothelial cells.<br>
They therefore suggested developing anti-cancer or anti-viral vaccines comprising a detoxicated immunogenic compound derivate of a protein coming from cancer cells, from virus infected cells or stroma immune cells, initially immunosuppressive and/or angiogenic with a local action, as, for example, a protein derived from the H1V1 virus Tat protein, the HTLV1 virus Tax protein, papillomavirus E7 protein as well as a mannan-depending lectin under an inactivated form.<br>
Now, it has been shown according to the invention that the immunogenic product comprising immunogenic heterocomplexes such as hereinabove defined allows for the induction of a strong antibody response against the various above-mentioned deleterious antigenic molecules.<br>
According to a first aspect, in the immunogenic heterocomplex of<br>
the invention, the antigenic protein(s) (i) consist(s) in cytokins naturally produced by said subject.<br>
Preferably, the antigenic protein(s) (i) is/are selected from interleukin-4, alpha interferon, gamma interferon, VEGF, interleukin-10, alpha TNF, beta TGF, interleukin-5 and interleukin-6.<br>
According to a second aspect, the antigenic protein(s) (i) making up an immunogenic heterocomplex of the invention is/are immunosuppressive or angiogenic proteins, or proteins derived from immunosuppressive or angiogenic proteins.<br>
Preferably, the antigenic protein(s) (i) is/are selected amongst a papillomavirus E7 protein, the VIH 1 virus Tat protein, the HTLV 1 or HTLV 2 virus Tax protein, and the self p53 protein.<br>
According to a third aspect, the antigenic protein(s) (i) making up an immunogenic heterocomplex according to the invention is/are proteins being toxic at a low dose to man or to a non human mammal. These are more particularly various proteins being lethal to man at a dose lower than 1 mg, lower than 100µg, lower than 10 µg, even lower than 1 µg. These are predominantly toxic proteins able to be used for manufacturing so-called «biological » weapons, such as ricin, botulic toxins, staphylococcus enterotoxins, as well as an anthrax toxic protein (EF, LF, PA).<br>
The carrier protein molecule (ii) included in an immunogenic protein heterocomplex of the invention could be a carrier molecule conventionally used in immunology, such as KLH, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), toxoid tetanos, B cholera toxin, etc.<br>
Moreover, in an immunogenic product of the invention, the protein carrier molecule could be selected so as to induce or stimulate, besides the production of T helper lymphocytes, a cytotoxic and/or humoral immune response against itself, and its counterpart of native protein in the host organism, respectively through the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and of B lymphocytes specific to such a carrier molecule.<br>
Such a particular embodiment of an immunogenic product of the invention is particularly useful when there is simultaneously sought an efficient antibody response against an immunosuppressive or angiogenic deleterious protein, more particularly, for producing neutralizing or blocking antibodies, and a cell immune response generated by cytotoxic T<br>
lymphocytes raised against cells having at their surface the native antigen associated to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules, for example, an antigen of a pathogen, such as the VIHl virus or a papillomavirus, or an antigen specifically expressed in cancer cells such as CEA, p53, Dil2, etc.<br>
Thus, according to this particular embodiment, the immunogenic product of the invention is characterized in that the carrier protein molecule (ii) is an immunogenic protein inducing, besides the production of T helper lymphocytes, the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes raised against cells having at their surface said carrier protein molecule, or any peptide being derived therefrom, in association with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules and/or the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes raised against the carrier protein.<br>
Thus, immunogenic products comprising immunogenic heterocomplexes of the invention are efficient immunologic means for the active therapeutic vaccination of an individual, whether a human mammal or a non human mammal, against a large variety of pathologies.<br>

For this purpose, the invention provides an immunogenic product comprising (i) an IgE isotype human antibodiy and (ii) the VIH1 inactivated Tat protein.<br>
i) For the prevention against lethal proteins used in biological weapons<br>
Also, an immunogenic product according to the invention could be used for immunizing individuals against numerous toxic products used, in particular, in chemical and biological weapons, as for example, ricin.<br>
Amongst the most toxic proteins against which an immunization,<br>
mainly through the production of antibodies, is being sought, botulic toxins, ricin, staphylococcus enterotoxins, Clostridium perfringens toxins and anthrax toxic proteins.<br>
Generally speaking, for producing an immunogenic product according to the invention, wherein the antigenic protein (i) is a highly toxic protein of the above-mentioned type, a previously detoxicated protein is used under the form of a toxoid. For detoxicating the protein, before its use for producing an immunogenic product according to the invention, various methods could be used, and preferably one of the following methods consisting in:<br>
a)	treating the native toxic protein by glutaraldehyde;<br>
b)	treating the native toxic protein through the combined action of formol and glutaraldehyde; or<br>
c)	if need be, through chemical modification of His and Tyr groups by means of appropriate reagents, for example, through carboxymethylation of such amino acid residues.<br>
For preventing the lethal action of toxins originating from Bacillus anthracis, as proteins, antigenic proteins (i), a detoxicated protein originating from an anthrax protein selected amongst EF (« Edema Factor »), LF (« Lethal Factor ») and PA (« Protective Antigen ») proteins are used preferably.<br>
For preventing the lethal actions of proteins originating from Clostridium perfringens, as the antigenic protein (i), a detoxicated protein originating from the Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens are preferably used.<br>
For preventing the lethal action of toxins originating form Clostridium botulinum, as antigenic proteins (i), a detoxicated protein originating from a botulic toxin selected amongst A, B, C, D, E, F and G toxins being naturally synthetized in the form a single 150 kDa polypeptide chain as well as the Hc fragment of such botulinic toxins, said fragment Hc having a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa, are preferably used.<br>
For producing inactivated botulic toxins, the man of the art could use techniques known per se, more particularly those used for preparing the anterior vaccine compositions, such as those described by Fiock et al. or by Siegel et al. (Fiock, M.A., Cardella, M.A.,Gearinger, N.F., J. Immunol,<br>
1963, 90, 697-702; Siegel, L.S., J. Clin. Microbiol., 1988, 26, 2351-2356).<br>
For preventing the lethal action of toxins originating from ricin seed (Ricinus communis), as the antigenic protein (i), a detoxicated protein originating from the ricin toxin, preferably the |3 fragment of ricin, is preferably used.<br>
Thus, the invention also provides an immunogenic product comprising (i) the ß fragment of ricin and (ii) the KLH protein.<br>
For purifying ricin, the man of the art could use any known technique, such as those described by Osborne et al., Kabat et al. or Kunnitz et al. (Osborne,T.B., Mendel,LB. and Harris,J.F.: Amer. J. Physiol., 1905, 14,259-269; Kabat,E.A.Heidelberger,M. and Bezer,A.E.: J. Biol. Chem., 1947, 168,629-; Kunnitz,M. and McDonald,M. :J.Gen.Physiol., 1948,22,25-Moule,Y.:Bull.Soc.Chim.Biol., 1951,33,1461-1467). He could also make use of the affinity chromatography purification techniques described by Tomila et al., Nicolson et al. or Olsnes et al. (Tomila,M., Kurokawa, T., Onozaki, K. et a/.:Experientia, 1972, 28, 84-85; Nicolson, G.L. and Blaustein, J.: J. Biochim. Biophys.Acta, 1972, 266, 543-547; 01snes,S., Salvedt, E. and Pihl,A.:J. Biol. Chem.,1974,249,803-810). The ricin A and B chains could be purified as described by Hedge et al.(Hedge,R. and Podder,S.K.,:Eur.Biochem., 1998, 254, 596-601).<br>
For preventing the lethal action of toxins originating from staphylococcus and more particularly from Staphylococcus aureus, as the antigenic protein (i), a detoxicated protein originating from a toxin selected amongst SEA (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A »), SEB (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B »), SEC (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C »), SED (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin D »), SEE (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin E »), SEG (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin G »), SEH (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin H »), SEI (« Staphylococcal Enterotoxin I ») and TSST-1 (« Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 ») is preferably used.<br>
The above listed enterotoxins could be prepared by the man of the art by means of techniques described in the listed work below, relating to the description of each of such toxins.<br>
SEA is synthesized in the form of a precursor enterotoxin with 257 amino acids (Huang, I.Y., Hughes, J.L, Bergdoll, M.S. and Schantz, E.J. J Biol. Chem. 1987, 262, 7006-7013). The mature toxin with a molecular<br>
mass equal to 27,100 Da derives from the precursor toxin through the loss of a N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence with 24 amino acid residues (Betley, M.J. and Mekalanos, J.J. J Bacterid., 1998, 170. 34-41). SEA exists under 3 different isoforms through their IP.<br>
The SEB precursor protein comprises 267 amino acids (Mr=31,400 Da) with a N-terminal signal peptide with 27 amino acids. Its binding site to the receptor of T cells (« T-Cell Receptor » or « TCR ») encompasses the shallow cavity, whereas the class II MHC molecule is fixed on an adjacent site (Kappler, J.W., Herman, A., Clements, J. and Marrack, P.: J. Exp. Med., 1992, 175, 387-396; Papageorgiu, A.C., Trauter, H.S. and Acharya, K.R. J Mol. Biol., 1998, 277, 61-79; Soos, J.M. and Johnson, H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1994, 201, 596-602).<br>
SEC possesses 3 antigenically distinct sub-types: SEC 1, SEC 2 et SEC 3. The precursor proteins contains 267 amino acid residues (Houde, C.J., Hackett, S.P. and Bohach, G.A. Mol. Gen.

(KLH:Ricin-a ratio = T.30). Examples of biochemical characterizations of heterocomplexes<br>
A. Material and Methods of examples 12 to 23<br>
The biochemical characterizations of heterocomplexes are performed by means of the following techniques:<br>
1 . Antigenicity test<br>
The study of antigenicity of a heterocomplex compared to the antigenicity of poteins making it up is performed by a conventional indirect ELISA. Such a technique allows for a protein to be quantitatively measured through the specific recognition of an antibody raised against an antigen. Such a test comprises depositing sample dilutions containing the sought protein in wells of a microtiter plate. A specific polyclonal antibody reacts<br>
with the immobilized protein. A second antibody, conjugated with horseradish peroxydase, specific to the first one is then added. The formed complex is revealed through incubation with OPD. The resulting yellow colour is directly proportional to the amount of bound proteins. The absorbance (DO) of each well is measured by means of a microplate reader. The amount of protein present in the sample is then determined by means of a calibrating range.<br>
2.	Isoelectrofocusing in agarose gel followed by a Western Blot<br>
The isoelectrofocusing in agarose gel allows to separate molecules depending on their isoelectric point (Ip) under non denaturing conditions, allowing to study heterocomplexes without destroying the weak bonds existing within such complexes.<br>
The isofocusing is followed by an emergence through a Western blot. After electrophoretic separation, the molecules are transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane through capillarity. Such molecules are then characterized by immunochemistry.<br>
3.	Measurement of the percentage of molecules of the antigen of interest<br>
covalentlv linked to the carrier protein molecule (First method)<br>
Estimating the percentage of molecules of the antigen of interest covalently linked to carrier protein molecules in an immunogenic product occurs, for example, through molecular sieving on a column containing Superdex 200, under denaturing (8 M urea) and reducing (5% beta-mercaptoethanol) conditions.<br>
The % of covalently linked molecules of the antigen of interest is deducted from the amount of antigen of interest (determined by a conventional indirect ELISA) present in the exclusion volume of the column. Indeed, the carrier protein molecule, such as KLH, having a molecular mass much higher than the highest fractionating limit of the column being used (200 kDa in this case), exists in the exclusion volume of such a column. Thus, under denaturing and reducing conditions, only the antigens of interest covalently linked to the carrier protein molecule exist in the exclusion volume.<br>
4.	Measurement of the percentage of molecules of the antigen of interest<br>
covalentlv linked to the carrier protein molecule (Second method)<br>
The percentage of cytokin fixed on the carrier protein (KLH) was<br>
determined by a double sandwich ELISA, by means of a capture antibody specifically directed against the carrier protein.<br>
100 µl of horse polyclonal antibodies raised against KLH (1 mg/ml) diluted in a 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 NaCl 150mM (PBS) are bound in wells of a microtiter plate (high-binding Costar) for 2 hours at 37°C. After 3 washes in PBS/0,1% Tween 20 (PBST), the wells are saturated with PBS containing 2% of BCS.<br>
After 1.30 hour of saturation, the wells are washed three times with PBST, then heterocomplex 2 by 2 dilutions (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312 and 0.156 µg/ml) made in duplicate, are added in the wells (100 µl/well).<br>
After 2 hours of incubation, the wells are washed three times with PBST. The Tween, a dissociating agent, present in the washing buffer, allows to remove all the molecules which are not covalently linked to the KLH being, itself, specifically bound on the capture antibody.<br>
Then, both heterocomplex dilutions are treated in two different ways:<br>
a)	the first set is incubated with an antibody raised against KLH<br>
b)	the second set is incubated with an antibody raised against cytokin.<br>
After 1.30 hour of incubation at 37°C, the wells are washed as previously indicated then incubated with a secondary antibody coupled to the peroxydase, directed againt the origin species of the first antibody. After 1.30 hour of incubation at 37°C, the antibodies are washed again. Then, the addition of the peroxydase substrate, O-PhenyleneDiamine (OPD) allows for the revealation of the presence of the KLH bound by the capture antibody and cytokins covalently bound on the KLH.<br>
The amount of KLH bound by the capture antibody and then the amount of cytokin molecules covalently bound on the KLH are calculated by means of calibrating curves done by ELISA.<br>
The percentage of cytokin covalently bound to the KLH is then determined.<br>

The KLH-IFNα preparation is passed on a superdex S200 column following the above described conditions. The apparent peak in the exclusion volume was collected, dialyzed then freeze-dried. The concentration in antigen of interest was determined by the indirect ELISA technique. The IFNα amount present in the excluded volume is 30 fig while 1000 µg of IFN were used for preparing the immunogenic product, without any measurable loss of antigen during the preparing method. The percentage of molecules of the antigen of interest covalently linked to the KLH molecule in the immunogenic product comprising KLH-IFNa heterocomplexes can therefore be estimated to approximately 3%. Example 17: Biochemical characterization of the gpl60-IFNα heterocomplex<br>
1.	Antigenicity<br>
The human gpl60-IFNα complex has an antigenicity dentical to the antigenicity of the gpl60 protein as well as to that of human IFNα.<br>
2.	Isoelectrofocusing followed by a Western Blot<br>
Fig. 4 shows that the human gpl60-IFNa heterocomplex migrates under the form of one single strip at a Ip being quite different from the Ip of the gpl60 protein recombining the component. The Ip of such a heterocomplex is slightly lower than that of IFNα.<br>

1-immunization<br>
At days 0, 7, 14, 21, a group of 8 mice receives a 0.1 ml (10 µg)<br>
injection of an AIF emulsion through the intramuscular route. A 5 µg booster injection in AIF is given at D60.<br>
A blood sample at the retro-orbital level is taken from each mouse before the first injection at d-2.<br>
3 control mice receive the same preparations without any immunogen.<br>
The mice are sacrificed 12 days after the last immunization.<br>
2-toxicity<br>
The abnormal toxicity is studied in 3 mice receiving one human dose (50 µg) according to the pharmacopeia.<br>
The lack of immunotoxicity of the heterocomplex is evaluated in vitro by cell proliferation test conducted on PBMCs cultivated in the presence of the complex and stimulated by PPD or toxoid tetanos.<br>
B. Results<br>
1. Lack of toxicity of the heterocomplex in vivo and in vitro<br>
The mice immunized both with the KLH-murine VEGF preparation and the murine VEGF only do not show any clinical sign and no anatomic wound. The immunosuppression test shows that doses of 100 ng/ml to 1 µg/ml of KLH-murine VEGF do not reduce the proliferation of lymphocytes.<br>
None of the three mice immunized with 50 µg of the heterocomplex show any sign of toxicity (temperature, cutaneous disorders, systemic or regional signs) during the 7 days following the injection.<br>
2-Humoral response<br>
The humoral response is measured by the presence in the serum of antibodies of the IgG type directed against the murine VEGF, determined by ELISA and expressed in titer (opposite of the dilution giving an optical density higher than 0.3). Fig. 5 shows the resulting antibody titers.<br>
The mice immunized with the KLH-murine VEGF preparation show higher antibody titers of the IgG type than those of mice immunized with the murine VEGF only.<br>

each group of mice were pooled. Different dilutions of such serum pools (1/100 - 1/800) taken at D-2 and D72 were pre-incubated for 2 hours with 20 ng/ml of murine VEGF then deposited on such endothelial cells. The cell culture continued at 37°C in a humid atmosphere loaded with 5% of C02 for 3 days. 18 hours before the end of the incubation, 0.5 µCi of titered mymidine/well were added. The neutralizing sera prevent the murine VEGF from inducing the proliferation of endothelial cells, while non neutralizing sera allow for the proliferation of such cells. The results are expressed in neutralization percentage. Fig. 6 shows the obtained results.<br>

The mice immunized with the KLH-human VEGF preparation show higher antibody titers of the IgG type than those of mice immunized with the human VEGF only.<br>

The immunogenic (humoral) activity of the murine KLH-IL4 preparation compared to that of the murine IL4 was studied in 18 to 20 g balb c mouse.<br>
1-immunization<br>
At days 0, 7, 14, 21, a group of 8 mice receives a 0.1 ml (10 fig) injection of an AIF emulsion through the intramuscular route. A 5 fig booster injection in AIF is given at D60.<br>
A blood sample at the retro-orbital level is taken from each mouse before the first injection at D-2 and D72.<br>

None of the three mice immunized with 50 ug of the heterocomplex show any sign of toxicity (temperature, cutaneous disorders, systemic or regional signs) during the 7 days following the injection.<br>
2-Humoral response<br>
The humoral response is measured by the presence in the serum of antibodies of the IgG type raised against the murine VEGF, determined by ELISA and expressed in titer (opposite of the dilution giving an optical density higher than 0.3). Fig. 9 shows the resulting antibody titers.<br>
The mice immunized with the KLH-murine IL4 preparation show<br>
higher antibody titers of the IgG type than those of mice immunized with the murine IL4 only.<br>
The neutralizing activity of those antibodies present in mice immunized with the KLH-murine IL4 preparation was measured by means of the biological activity test of the murine IL4. This test uses HT-2 cells, murine cell lineages the growth of which is IL4 murine- dependent (Watson, J. 1979. J. Exp. Med. 150:1510.). Endothelial cells HT-2 are cultivated in round bottom wells of a microculture plate at a level of 10,000 cells per well. Sera diluted at 1/50 taken at D-2 and D72 are pre-incubated for 2 hours with 50 ng/ml of murine H4 then deposited on HT-2 cells. The cell culture is continued at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere loaded with 5% of C02 for 3 days. 4 hours before the end of the incubation, 0,5 µCi of titered thymidine/well were added. The neutralizing sera prevent the murine IL4 from inducing the proliferation of HT-2 cells, while non neutralizing sera allow for the proliferation of such cells. The results are expressed in neutralization percentage. Fig. 10 shows the obtained results.<br>
The antibodies induced by the complex are neutralizing.<br>
Moreover, such neutralizing antibodies raised against murine IL4 prevent the production, by those mice, of antibodies of the IgE type raised against Bet v 1, when the latter are challenged with birch-tree pollen. Fig. 11 indeed shows that mice immunized with KLH-murine IL4 have neutralizing IgGs raised against murine NL4 blocking the production of IgE raised against Bet v 1 and start to produce antibodies of the IgG type directed against Bet v 1. On the other hand, mice which did not receive any murine KLH-IL4 and therefore not having any antibodies of the IgG type directed against IL4, only produce antibodies of the IgE type directed against Bet v 1.

The neutralizing activity of such antibodies induced by the human KLH-IL4 preparation was measured by means of the biological activity test of human IL4. This test uses TF-1 cells, human cell lineage the growth of which is IL4 human-dependent (Kitamura,T. et al., 1989. J. Cell Physiol. 140:323-34). TF-1 cells are cultivated in round bottom wells of a microculture plate at a level of 10,000 cells per well. Sera diluted at 1/50 taken at D-2 and D72 preincubated for 2 hours with 50 ng/ml of humain IL4 were then deposited on the TF-1 cells. The cell culture is continued at 37°C in a humid atmosphere loaded with 5% of CO2 for 3 days. 4 hours before the end of the incubation, 0.5 µCi of titered thymidine/well were added. The neutralizing sera prevent the human IL4 from inducing the proliferation of TF-1 cells, while non neutralizing sera allow for proliferation of such cells. The results are expressed in neutralization percentage. Fig. 12 shows the obtained results.<br>

The neutralizing activity of such antibodies was measured by means of the biological activity test of the human IFNa. (Rubinstein S, J Viral, 1981, 755-8). The aim of this test for measuring the antiviral effect is to evaluate the inhibition of the MDBK cell lysis by the VSV (Vesicular Stomatitis virus) in the presence of IFN. MDBK cells are cultivated in round bottom wells of a microculture plate at a level of 350,000 cells per well. Different dilutions of sera (1/100 at 1/800) taken at D-2 and D72 were pre-incubated for 2 hours with 5 ng/ml of human IFNa then deposited on MDBK cells. After 20 hours of cell culture performed at 37°C in a humid atmosphere loaded with 5%of C02, the diluted sera present in the wells are removed, the cells washed, then 100 µl containing 100 LD50 (50 % lethal dosis) of VSV virus are added. 18 hours after the addition of the virus the lytic effect of the virus is measured. The neutralizing sera allow the VSV to lyse cells, while non neutralizing sera prevent such a lysis. The results are expressed in neutralization percentage.<br>

At day 0, a group of 3 mice (group A) receives a 0.1 ml injection of an AIF emulsion through the intramuscular route containing 60 µg of the KLH-TNF α complex. A booster injection of 30 µg and 15 µg in AIF is given respectively at D21 and D60. 3 control mice receive a dosis equivalent in murine TNFa according to the same protocol, (group B)<br>
At day 0, a group of 3 mice (group C) receives a 0.1 ml injection in AIF through intramuscular route containing 60 µg of KLH-murine TNFα<br>
heterocomplex and 30 ug of the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide 5'-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3' (CpG ADN: 1826). A booster injection of 30 µg and of 15 µg of the KKL-murine TNFa heterocomplex in AIF is given respectively at D21 and D60. 3 control mice receive a dosis equivalent in murine TNFa according to the same protocol, (group D)<br>
A blood sample at the retro-orbital level is taken from each mouse before the first injection at d-2.<br>
The mice are sacrificed 12 days after the last immunization.<br>
2-toxicity<br>
The abnormal toxicity is sought in 3 mice receiving one human dose (50 µg) according to the pharmacopeia.<br>
The lack of immunotoxicity of the heterocomplex is evaluated in vitro by a cell proliferation test conducted on PBMCs cultivated in the presence of the complex and stimulated by PPD or toxoid tetanos.<br>
B. Results<br>
Lack of toxicity of the heterocomplex in vivo and in vitro<br>
The mice both immunized with the murine KLH-TNFa preparation and the murine TNFa only do not show any clinical sign and no anatomic wound. The immunosuppression test shows that doses of 100 ng/ml to 1 µg/ml of KLH-murine TFNα do not reduce the proliferation of lymphocytes.<br>
None of the three mice immunized with 50 ug of the heterocomplex with or without the DNA CPG 1826 show any sign of toxicity (temperature, cutaneous disorders, systemic or regional signs) during the 7 days following the injection.<br>
2-Humoral response<br>
The humoral response is measured by the presence in the serum of antibodies of the IgG type raised against the murine TNFa, determined by ELISA and expressed in titer. The presence of antibodies of the IgA type directed against the murine TNFa in vaginal secretions was also determined by ELISA and expressed in titer. The titer represents the opposite of the dilution giving an optical density higher than 0.3. The following table shows the resulting antibody titers.<br>

1-immunization<br>
At days 0, 7, 14, 21, a group of 3 mice receives a 0.1 ml (10 µg) injection of an AIF emulsion through the intramuscular route. A 5 µg booster injection in AIF is given at D60.<br>
A blood sample at the retro-orbital level is taken from each mouse before the first injection at D-2.<br>
3 control mice receive the same preparations without an immunogen.<br>
The mice are sacrificed 12 days after the last immunization.<br>
2-toxicitv<br>
The abnormal toxicity is sought in 3 mice receiving one human dosis (50 fig) according to the pharmacopeia.<br>
The lack of immunotoxicity of the heterocomplex is evaluated in vitro by a cell proliferation test conducted on PBMCs cultivated in the presence of the complex and stimulated by PPD or toxoid tetanos.<br>
B. Results<br>
2-Lack of toxicity of the heterocomplex in vivo and in vitro<br>
The mice both immunized with the KLH-human IgE preparation and the human IgE only, do not show any clinical sign and no anatomic wound. The immunosuppression test shows that doses of 100 ng/ml to 1 jug/ml of KLH-human IgE do not reduce the proliferation of lymphocytes.<br>
None of the three mice immunized with 50 µg of the heterocomplex show any sign of toxicity (temperature, cutaneous disorders, systemic or regional signs) during the 7 days following the injection.<br>
2-Humoral response<br>
The humoral response is measured by the presence in the serum of antibodies of the IgG type directed against the human IgE, determined by ELISA and expressed in titer (reciprocal of the dilution giving an optical density higher than 0.3). The following table shows the resulting antibody titers.<br>
Table 12 Titer<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The mice immunized with the KHL-hIgF preparation show antibody titers of the IgG type slightly higher than those of mice immunized with the hlgE preparation only. Example 34: Immunogenic activity of the KLH-Ricin-p heterocomplex<br>
A.	Material and methods<br>
The immunogenic (humoral) activity of the KLH-Ricin-ß preparation compared to that of the ricin (3 fragment was studied in 18 to 20 g balb/c mouse.<br>
1-immunization<br>
At days 0, 7, 14, 21, a group of 3 mice receives a 0.1 ml (10 µg) injection of an AIF emulsion through the intramuscular route. A 5 µg booster injection in AIF is given at D60.<br>

B.	Results<br>
3-Lack of toxicity of the heterocomplex in vivo and in vitro The mice both immunized with the human KLH-Ricin- preparation and the ricin ß-fragment only do not show any clinical sign and no anatomic wound. The immunosuppression test shows that doses of 100 ng/ml to 1 µg/ml of KLH-ricin p do not reduce the proliferation of lymphocytes.<br>
None of the three mice immunized with 50 µg of the heterocomplex show any sign of toxicity (temperature, cutaneous disorders, systemic or<br>
regional signs) during the 7 days following the injection.<br>
2-Humoral response<br>
The humoral response is measured by the presence in the serum of antibodies of the IgG type directed against the B fragment of ricin, determined by ELISA and expressed in titer (reciprocal of the dilution giving an optical density higher than 0.3). The following table shows the resulting antibody titers.<br>
Table 13<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The neutralizing activity of such antibodies was checked by the injection to the mouse of mixtures of anti-Ricin-P and ricin serum which did not cause the animal's death, contrary to what was observed during the administration to the mouse of ricin and normal serum mixtures.<br>
