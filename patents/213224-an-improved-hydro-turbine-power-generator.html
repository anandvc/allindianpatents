				<td>FIELD.. QF<br>
This invention relates to a hydro-turbines power generator for generating electric power employing the potential energy contained in a height of water.<br>
KNOWN ART<br>
Presently,  conventional hydro-turbine generators are  not  available  in  submergible  or   submersible construction.  Thus, the known generators  are normally installed indoors in a covered room, so that no water is allowed to come in contact with the electric  generator, which adds to cost of the installation. It requires wore space also. In the hilly slopes, enough -flat  sp«c»  ia not easily available and therefore the turbine units can be  installed  in  much  -fewer  locations  and  energy abvailable  from most of the falls goes unutilised  and thus wasted.  Also quite often the turbine sites have to be far away from the falls and increasing the length of pipe penetocke, thus considerable amount of energy  is lost  in pipe friction or  alternatively,  the  pipe diameter has to be increased.<br>
OBJECTS oF INVENTION<br>
A primary object of this invention is to propose a chydro-turbine  generator   which  is   submergible  or submersible.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved, hydro-turbine generator which can be employed nearer to the waterfall or even on the water stream.<br>
A further object of this present invention is to propose an improved hydro-turbine generator having a construction such that no water or moist air can enter the inside of the generator and thus prevent it from damage by moisture even when installed to operate in the open outdoor or in a flowing stream without any external protection from falling water or moist air.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an improved hydro-turbine generator and wherein the wire leads carrying electric power from the generator are » properly sealed at exit from the generator, BO that no moisture can seep into the generator machine along the wire leads.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an improved hydro turbine generator and wherein the electric control panel can be located remote from the generator at a convenient covered place.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved hydro-turbine power generator for generating electric power by employing the potential energy contained in a height of water comprising:<br>
(i) a generator casing having electric generator disposed therein, the output terminals of said generator connected to a control panel for employing electrical power to a load through said control panel,<br>
(ii) an oil reservoir casing having an oil reservoir below the said electric generator and held to the casing of said electric generator,<br>
(iii) a turbine head casing disposed below of and held to said oil reservoir casing and having an inlit adopted to be connected to water feedstock pipe,<br>
(iv) a turbine casing below of and held to said turbine head casing, a runner disposed within said turbine casing for causing a rotation of the turbine shaft upon water impinging on said runner,<br>
(v) said runner shaft coupled to the generator shaft through a coupling, characterised in that a mechanical rotary seal provided on said shaft; below of said oil reservoir and an electrical probe.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further  objects and advantages of this  invention Uphill be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig.l snows a scheinatic c view of the generator in accordance with one embodiment of the i nvent ion<br>
Fig.2 shows a schematic view o-f the generator in a accordance with another view.<br>
The generator (A) o-f the present invention has a construction such as to prevent entry of moisture or water into the interior o-f the generator to damage the electrical insulation. The shaft (l) of the generator is supported and rotates between suitable ball bearings (2&amp;3) at the top and bottom of the rotor (16), as shown in Fig.1, The shaft extends at the bottom through the generator cover shield  into the oi1-chamber (8&gt;. A mechanical frictionlesB rotary seal  is incorporated below the lower ball-bearing cover shield . This rotary seal operates in an oil chamber (8).<br>
In an alternative construction, as shown in Fig.2, the generator shaft extends at the bottom from the oil-chamber  into the turbine-head <d>, where it is suitably coupled tu the turbine-shaft.  through a coupling<br><br>
A mechanical rotary seal (9) operates below the oil -chamber (8) , which protects the water in turbine-head (D) from entering the oil-chamber (8). Just in case, if the seal (9) starts leaking, water in trickles would enter the oil -chamber <b> and oil floats on the water in the oii-chamer .An electrical probe (10) in the oil chamber (8) instantally sends an electrical signal through connecting wire 
The shaft. (1) further extends into the volute chamber  and holds the runner (19) at (20). Another mechanical rotary seal (9) operates below the oil-chamber (8) . which protects the water in the turbine area -from entering the oil-chamber (8). The rotary seals are normally expected to work st at isf actor ily for long periods. However, just in case, after its full running life, if the seal (9) starts leaking, water in trickles would enter the oil-chamber (8) . An electrical probe  instantly sends an electrical signal through a multi-core connecting cable (11) to the control panel <c>. The control panel (C) instantaneously opertes a solenoid-operated valve  to stop water -flow into the turbine and thus no further water would enter the oil -chamber. The valve 
electrically connected to the control pan«l <c>  through control  cable  does not  allow the water that may have leaked into the oil-chamb«r  (8) to  enter  the generator valve bearings  and  further into the  generator  (A). Thus, the  generator  (A)  is double safe from any traces of moisture. Due to stoppage of  water-flow, the turbine also stops and no  damage  is caused to the whole system.<br>
The top and bottom generator shields  which hold the top and bottom ball bearings respectively, are also properly sealed at the joints with the generatos body (14) and securely bulted. Thus, the moisture is not allowed to enter the generator through these joints also.<br>
The generator A, the oil-chamber <q the turbine-head td> and the turbine <b> are all integrally bolted together to ffiaintain the alignment of the generator and turbine to ensure smooth continuous operation o-f the whole unit.<br>
The shaft (1) extends on the top through the top-bail bearing (2) and top-shield (12) and a devise (E) is incorporated at the shaft  top end and BO adopted as to transmit an electrical signal to the control panel <c through the linking multi-core control-cable when shaft rotating speed crosses pre-set upper or lower limits.. in turn control panel> immediately s»huts~off the water-supply to the turbine through the valve (12). The said pre-set turbine speeds also maintain the frequency of the electrical power generated within desired limits.<br>
The electrical power generated in the generator (A&gt; is transmitted through power-cable (15) to the control panel tC&gt;. Siniiliarly, the multi-core control-cable (11) from the generator (A) is also connected to the control panel (C).<br>
The control panel (C) has various usual protective devices and instruments for protecting the equipment from over-loading,  any other mal-functioning and  indicating or  recording the voltage, frequency-current and  energy generated and transmitted to the down-stream load.<br>
/ The control panel protects the turbine generator by stopping water supply in case of any mal-functioning of the unit such as water leakage of the seal, over leading etc.<br>
An artificial load (W) is electrically connected to the control panel (C&gt; through cable  speed in place of a conventional hydraulic governor incorporated with the turbine <b>.<br>
The arrangement of the various components, including the turbine <b generator tft control panel solenoid-operated valve and the penstock-pipe are adopted to provide continuous power supply so long required water flow in penstock pipe is avai1able></b>
This device would el so include any other configuration incorporating any or all of the above said unique features.<br>
As will be apparent, the generator of the present invention does not require a covered protection for the turbine, and can be installed in the open or even in the flow of the water stream.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
