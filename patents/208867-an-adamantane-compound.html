THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"AN ADAMANTANE COMPOUND"<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,    a   Swedish   company   of   S-151    85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ADAMANTANE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to adamantane derivatives, a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, a process for preparing the pharmaceutical compositions, and their use in therapy.<br>
Adamantane derivatives are known in the art, e.g. from WO 95/04720 for use as astrin and cholecystokinin receptor ligands, from Chem. Abs. (1977), Volume 86, No. 13 36: 89560d) for use as analgesics, and from US-A-3 464 998 as antibiotics.<br>
The P2X7 receptor (previously known as P2Z receptor), which is a ligand-gated ion channel, is present on a variety of cell types, largely those known to be involved in the uflammatory/immune process, specifically, macrophages, mast cells and lymphocytes A and B). Activation of the P2X7 receptor by extracellular nucleotides, in particular denosine triphosphate, leads to the release of interleukin-113 (IL-1Î²) and giant cell formation (macrophages/microglial cells), degranulation (mast cells) and proliferation (T cells), apoptosis and L-selectin shedding (lymphocytes). P2X7 receptors are also located a antigen-presenting cells (APC), keratinocytes, salivary acinar cells (parotid cells), spatocytes and mesangial cells.<br>
It would be desirable to make compounds effective as P2X7 receptor antagonists for be in the treatment of inflammatory, immune or cardiovascular diseases, in the aetiologies  which the P2X7 receptor may play a role.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is therefore provided a compound of general formula<br><br><br>

Pharmacological Analysis<br>
Certain compounds such as benzoylbenzoyl adenosine triphosphate (bbATP) are known to be agonists of the P2X7 receptor, effecting the formation of pores in the plasma membrane (Drag Development Research (1996), 37(3). p.126). Consequently, when the receptor is activated using bbATP in the presence of ethidium bromide (a fluorescent DNA probe), an increase in the fluorescence of intracellular DNA-bound ethidium bromide is observed. The increase in fluorescence can be used as a measure of P2X7 receptor activation and therefore to quantify the effect of a compound on the P2X7 receptor.<br>
In this manner, each of the title compounds of Examples 1 to 88 was tested for antagonist activity at the P2X7 receptor. Thus, the test was performed in 96-well flat<br>
bottomed microtitre plates, the wells being filled with 250 Âµl of test solution comprising<br><br>

bromide, 25 Âµl of a high potassium buffer solution containing 10  M bbATP, and 25 Âµl of the high potassium buffer solution containing 3x10-5  M test compound. The plate was covered with a plastics sheet and incubated at 37 Â°C for one hour. The plate was then read in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescent plate reader, excitation 520 nm, emission 595 nm, slit<br>
     widths: Ex 15 nm, Em 20 nm. For the purposes of comparison, bbATP (a P2X7 receptor agonist) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (a P2X7 receptor antagonist) were used separately in the test as controls. From the readings obtained, a PIC50 figure was calculated for each test compound, this figure being the negative logarithm of the concentration of test compound necessary to reduce the bbATP agonist activity by 50%. Each of the compounds of<br>
     Examples 1 to 88 demonstrated antagonist activity, having a PIC50 figure &gt; 4.50.<br><br>
