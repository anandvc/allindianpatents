				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of polyurethane resin, particularly it relates to a process for preparation of polyurethane resin for use as a dispersing binder, more particularly it relates to a process for preparation of polyurethane resin having a weight average molecular weight of at least about 20,000, preferably from 20,000 to 120,000.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polymeric binders in conjunction with dispersing agents have been used to coat magnetic particles on films such as polyester films and disks to form magnetic recording media.  High levels of the dispersing agent are usually necessary due to inefficient coupling of the dispersing agent and magnetic pigment.  Drawbacks to the use of high levels of dispersing agent in conjunction with the binder include bleeding of the dispersing agent and acceleration of the hydrolytic degradation of the binder, which results in mechanical property degradation.<br>
To overcome many of these drawbacks, various binders which themselves are dispersing agents have come increasingly into use.  Several patents disclose a variety of such binders.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,490,945 ("Slovinsky") discloses a polyurethane binder for magnetic recording media which itself is a dispersing agent.  The Slovinsky polyurethane binder is a moisture cured diisocyanate terminated prepolymer containing tertiary or quaternary nitrogen.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,286,022 ("Vermillion") is directed to a solution polymerized, hydroxyl terminated polyurethane block copolymer. The Vermillion polyurethane block copolymer comprises polyester or polyether segments, short chain aliphatic segments, 10-100 mole percent which contain tertiary and/or quaternary nitrogen, and symmetrical unbranched aromatic urethane segments interconnecting the polyester or polyether and short-chain aliphatic segments.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,089,344 discloses a magnetic recording medium formed on a base comprising a magnetic powder and a binder.  The binder<br><br>
consists of a reaction product of diol, a chain extender such as 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, a diisocyanate and a tertiary amine.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,124,424 also discloses a binder for magnetic recording medium. The binder comprises a hydroxy-group terminated polyurethane resin prepared by reaction of a polycarbonate polyol, a chain extender, organic diisocyanate, and an active hydrogen compound having one or more hydrophilic polar groups. The hydrophilic polar amino group may be a tertiary amino group.<br>
A dispersing binder having good dispersing characteristics, solubility, good mechanical properties and hydrolytic stability is desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel process for preparation of polyurethane resin comprising reacting :<br>
a)	polyol,<br>
b)	a diisocyanate,<br>
c)	a chain extender, and<br>
d)	a functional modifier.<br>
The present invention also comprises the use of this polyurethane as a dispersing binder. This dispersing binder yields magnetic dispersions having high gloss values indicative of good magnetic properties and dispersibility. It also provides excellent hydrolytic stability. This dispersing binder can be used advantageously to form advanced recording media using high surface area pigments.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of polyurethane resin, particularly it relates to a process for preparation of polyurethane resin for use as a dispersing binder, more particularly it relates to a process for preparation of polyurethane resin having a weight average molecular weight of at least about 20,000, preferably from 20,000 to 120,000 comprising step of random melt polymerisation of polyol, diisocyanate, a chain extender and a functional modifier in the manner such as hereindescribed to achieve a weight average molecular weight of at least 20,000, wherein the polyol, the diisocyanate and the chain extender are of kind such as hereinbefore described, and the functional modifier is a reaction product of an aminodiol of kind such as hereindescribed and Bronsted acid, and the polyol, diisocyanate, a chain extender and a functional modifier are taken in the ratio of 1.0 mole of polyol, from 0.5 to 5.0 moles of chain extender, diisocyanates in an amount such that the ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups is from 0.95 to 1.01, functional modifier in an amount necessary to obtain a theoretical polymer acid number in the range of 0.1 to 12 mg KOH/g.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The polyurethane of the present invention is prepared by reacting a polyol, a diisocyanate, a chain extender and a functional modifier.<br><br>
Polvol<br>
Suitable polyols include hydroxyl terminated polyethers, hydroxyl terminated polyesters, hydroxyl terminated polycaprolactones, hydroxyl terminated polycarbonate (i.e., a polycarbonate polyol) or mixtures thereof.<br>
A preferred class of hydroxyl terminated polyester intermediates is generally a linear polyester having a weight average molecular weight of from about 600 to about 2,000, and preferably from about 700 to about 1,400, and an acid number generally less than 0.8 and preferably less than 0.5.  The molecular weight is determined by end groups analysis.  The polyester intermediates are produced by (1) an esterification reaction of one or more glycols with one or more dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides, or (2) by transesterification reaction, i.e., the reaction of one or more glycols with esters of dicarboxylic acids.   Mole ratios generally in excess of one mole of glycol to acid are preferred so as to obtain linear chains having a preponderance of terminal hydroxyl groups.<br>
The dicarboxylic acids can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, or combinations thereof.   Suitable dicarboxylic acids which may be used alone or in mixtures usually have a total of from 4 to 15 carbon atoms and include:   succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanoic, isophthalic, terephthalic, cyclohexane dicarboxylic, and the like.  Anhydrides of the above dicarboxylic acids, such as phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, or the like, and mixture thereof can also be utilized.  Adipic acid is the preferred dicarboxylic acid.<br>
The ester-forming glycols can be aliphatic, aromatic, or combinations thereof; have a total of from 2 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples include:   ethylene glycol, propylene-l,2-glycol, 1,3-propanediol, butylene-1,3-glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 2,2-dimethyl-propane-l,3-diol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, decamethylene glycol, dodecamethylene glycol, hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ether; 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, 3-methyl-l,5-pentanediol and mixtures thereof.   1,4-butanediol is the preferred glycol.<br>
In addition to the above polyester polyols, numerous other types of polyester polyols known to the art and to the literatures can be utilized including<br><br>
those having different molecular weights and/or contain branch polyesters therein, For example polycaprolactone diols can be used.  These are known polyester reaction products of lactones and bifunctional compounds having two reactive sites capable of opening the lactone ring.  These bifunctional materials may be represented by the formula HX-R-XH wherein R is an organic radical which can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic and X is O, NH and NR where R is a hydrocarbon radical which can be alkyl, aryl, aralkyl and cycloalkyl. Such materials include diols, diamines and aminoalcohols preferably.  Useful diols include alkylene glycols wherein the alkylene group contains 2 to 10 carbon atoms for example, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propane diol, butanediol-1,4, hexamethylene diol-1,6 and the like and mixtures thereof.   The preferred ester 1,4 butanediol adipate.<br>
The lactones preferred for preparing the polyesters are epsilon-caprolactones having the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein at least 6 of the R's are hydrogen and the remainder are hydrogen or alkyl groups containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably methyl.  Mixtures of lactones may be employed to form the polyesters as epsilon-caprolactone and trimethyl-epsilon-caprolactone, "T" methyl-epsilon-caprolactone, "p" -methyl-epsilon-caprolactone, dimethyl-epsilon-caprolactone and the like.   The lactones are polymerized readily by heating .with the bifunctional reactant to a temperature of about 100 to about 200°C.   Such polycaprolactone polyols are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,660,357 which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.   Generally, the polycaprolactone diols have a weight average molecular weight in the range of from about 500 to about 5,000.<br>
It is noted that suitable polycarbonate polyols can also be utilized as an intermediate, and the same, as well as methods of preparation thereof, are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,643,949, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.   Other low molecular weight polycarbonate polyol intermediates can also be made from diols such as those set forth hereinabove, including 1,6-hexanediol, and the like, and phosgene; or by transesterification with low molecular weight carbonates such as diethyl or diphenyl carbonate or mixtures thereof.   Generally, the polycarbonate polyols have a weight average molecular weight from about 500 to about 5,000.<br>
The hydroxyl terminated polyethers can be polyether polyols derived from a diol or polyol having a total of from 2 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably an alkyl diol or glycol which is reacted with an ether comprising an alkylene oxide having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, typically ethylene oxide or • propylene oxide, or mixtures thereof.   For example, hydroxyl functional polyether can be produced by first reacting propylene glycol with propylene oxide followed by subsequent reaction with ethylene oxide.   Primary hydroxyl groups resulting from ethylene oxide are more reactive than secondary hydroxyl groups and thus are preferred.   Useful commercial polyether polyols'include poly(ethylene glycol), polypropylene glycol), poly-(propylene-ethylene glycol), poly (tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG), copolyethers produced from tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethylene oxide or THF and propylene oxide, glycerol adduct comprising trimethylolpropane reacted with propylene oxide, pentaerythritol adduct comprising pentaerythritol reacted with propylene oxide, and similar hydroxyl functional polyethers or mixtures thereof.   Polyether polyols further include polyamide adducts of an alkylene oxide and can include, for example, ethylenediamine adduct comprising the reaction product of ethylenediamine and propylene oxide, diethylenetriamine adduct comprising the reaction product of diethylenetriamine with propylene oxide, and similar polyamide type polyether polyols.   The various polyether intermediates generally have an average molecular weight, as determined by assay of the terminal functional groups, of from about 250 to about 3,000.   The most preferred average molecular weight is in the range of about 600 to about 1,000.<br>
In addition to the above polyether type polyols, other polyols can. be utilized known to those skilled in the art as well as to the literature such as those having different molecular weights, made from different reactants, and the like.  The determination of the polyol to be used is dependent on the specific needs of the particular application and is well within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art.  The above-mentioned polyols can be used alone or in any combination.<br>
The most preferred polyol is poly(tetramethylene adipate). Diisocvanate<br>
Any suitable diisocyanate can be used.   Suitable diisocyanates include non-hindered aromatic diisocyanates and cyclic aliphatic diisocyanates.

The functional modifier is prepared by reacting an aminodiol with a Bronsted acid compound.  The synthesis can be carried out neat or in solution. In a neat reaction, the reactants can be charged together into the reaction vessel. An exotherm is observed.  In a solution reaction, dropwise addition of reactants is preferred.  The functional modifiers obtained hi these syntheses vary from crystalline solids to viscous, pourable liquids at room temperature.    Alternatively, the functional modifier can be prepared by adding the aminodiol and Bronsted acid compound to the chain extender and/or polyol.   The stoichiometry used in the functional modifier synthesis depends on the nature of the Bronsted acid compound.   For monobasic acids, an equimolar amount of aminodiol is generally used.   For dibasic acids, the amount of aminodiol used may correspond to the first equivalence point or the second equivalence point of the acid.  If desired, a slight excess of aminodiol may be used in some systems.<br>

The most preferred chain extender is neopentyl glycol.<br>
REACTION<br>
The novel polyurethane composition is prepared by random melt polymerization.  In this technique, one or more polyols, one or more chain extenders, and one or more functional modifiers are blended together in the range of about 55°C to about 90°C.  The blend is then heated in the range of about 100°C to about 160°C.  A diisocyanate, or mixture of diisocyanates is heated in the range of about 100°C to about 140°C, then mixed with the blend vigorously. Inasmuch as the reaction is exothermic, the temperature will increase to about 200-270°C.<br>
The components are added to obtain a theoretical polymer acid number, based on the amount of functional modifier, in the range of about 0.1 to about 12, desirably from 0.5 to about 8, and preferably from 1 to about 4 mg KOH/g sample.   The acid number, which is defined as the milligrams of KOH needed to neutralize 1 gram of sample, can be determined by titrating the sample with base to a colorimetric or potentiometric endpoint.   Colorimetric endpoints are usually determined with phenolphthalein indicator.<br>
Generally, the polymer is prepared with one mole of one or more polyols, from about 0.5 to about 5.0 moles of one or more chain extenders, the required amount of one or more functional modifiers to attain the target theoretical polymer acid number, and an amount of one or more diisocyanates such that the ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups is about 0.95 to about 1.01.<br>
Catalysts may be used to speed up the polyurethane formation and any of those catalysts normally used by those skilled in the art may be employed. Typical catalysts include dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous octanoate, phenyl mercuric propionate, lead octoate, iron acetyl-acetonate, magnesium acetylacetonate, triethylene diamine, and the like.   These may be used, normally in amounts from about 50 to about 200 ppm, based upon the total weight of the reactants.<br>
POLYURETHANE<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the novel polyurethane resin formed in accordance with the present invention is approximately 20,000 to<br>
120,000.  The preferred range of the weight average molecular weight is about 40,000 to 90,000.  This polyurethane provides magnetic dispersions having high gloss values indicative of good magnetic properties and dispersibility.  It also provides excellent hydrolytic stability.  Accordingly, this novel polyurethane can be used advantageously as a dispersing binder to form advanced recording media using higher surface area pigments.<br>
MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
The novel dispersing binder of the present invention can be used in the formation of magnetic recording media according to any conventional process. For example, the novel binder, magnetic particles, and if necessary, one or more various additives are mixed together with an organic solvent to prepare a magnetic coating formulation.  The magnetic coating formulation is then placed on a base film or a synthetic disk.  Exemplary base films include polyester films. After the coating formulation is dried, a surface treatment such as calendar rolling is applied.<br>
As the magnetic particles, y-Fe2O3, mixed crystals of y-Fe203 and Fe3O4, cobalt-doped y-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, CrO2, barium ferrite, pure iron, surface-treated iron (e.g., Fe-Co-Co-Ni, Fe-Co-Ni, Fe-Co-B, Fe-Co-Cr-B, Mn-Bi, Mn-Al, Fe-Co-V), iron nitride and other similar magnetic particles are all usable.  The preferred magnetic particles are Cr02 or yFe2O3.<br>
Any additives can be added to the magnetic coating formulation as needed.  A variety of materials conventionally known as additives for magnetic coating formulations can be suitably used, such as lubricants, abrasives, dispersants, antistatic agents and fillers.<br>
Further, exemplary solvents usable for the preparation of the magnetic coating formulation include ketones, e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol; esters, e.g., methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; glycol ethers, e.g., propylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and dioxane; the acetate esters of glycol ethers, e.g., ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, e.g., benzene, cyclohexanone, toluene and xylene; aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g., hexane and heptane; nitropropane; tetrahydrofuran; dimethylacetamide; and dimethylformamide and mixtures thereof.  The most preferred solvent is a mixture of 60% methyl ethylene ketone, 20% cyclohexanone, 20% toluene.<br>
The following non-limiting examples serve to further illustrate the present invention in greater detail.<br>

POLYMER SYNTHESES<br>
Polymers were prepared by the random melt polymerization method.   In this method, the polyol, chain extender, and functional modifier are blended together at about 60°C.   The blend is then heated to 100-120°C. Diphenylmethanediisocyanate (MDI) is heated separately to 100-120°C, then mixed with the blend.  The reactants are vigorously mixed for about 3 minutes, during which time the temperature typically increases to 200-250°C.  The polymer melt is discharged into a cooled pan, then cured at 60°C for 1 week after synthesis of the polymer, the Brookfield viscosities of these polymers were determined at 25°C.<br>

Magnetic properties were measured on a Motorola LDJ BH meter.   Properties of the tape samples are shown in Table II.<br>
POLYMER HYDROLYTIC STABILITY Hydrolytic stability of the polymers was evaluated by immersing solvent-cast films in water at 70°C for three weeks.   GPC was used to determine the extent of molecular weight reduction.  Results are shown in Table III.<br>

As Table II illustrates, the polyurethane formed using the functional modifier as disclosed by this invention has unexpectedly high gloss values indicating great dispersability.  In contradistinction, the polyurethanes formed using solely tertiary amines (e.g., Comparative Examples 75, 76, 77), quaternary amines (e.g., Comparative Example 73) and acid phosphate (e.g., Comparative Example 74), or no functional modifier (e.g., Comparative Examples 84 or 85) have very low gloss values.<br>
Table III illustrates the polyurethane of the instant invention provides excellent hydrolytic stability compared to polyurethanes formed using solely tertiary amines (e.g., Comparative Example 75) or an acid phosphate (e.g., Comparative Example 74).<br>
In summary, novel polyurethane compositions and have been described.  Although specific embodiments and examples have been disclosed herein, it should be borne in mind that these have been provided by way of explanation and illustration and the present invention is not limited thereby.
