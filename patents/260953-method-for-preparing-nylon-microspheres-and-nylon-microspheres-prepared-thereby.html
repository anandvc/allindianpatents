Method for Preparing Nylon Microspheres and<br>
Nylon Microspheres Prepared Thereby<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing nylon microspheres and<br>
nylon microspheres prepared thereby. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to a method for preparing high molecular nylon microspheres with<br>
controllable particle size; and nylon microspheres with high molecular weight and<br>
controlled particle size.<br>
Technical Background<br>
Nylon has been widely used in engineering plastics due to its high strength.<br>
high wearing resistance, high chemical resistance, and good deformation resistance<br>
and anti-aging ability. Nylon synthesized by anionic ring-opening polymerization<br>
has a much higher molecular weight than that of nylon synthesized by condensation<br>
polymerization, thus it is superior in applicability.<br>
Nylon particles see a great potential for application In coatings and raw<br>
materials for rollforming molding and extrusion molding. Conventional processes<br>
for preparing nylon particles include solution precipitation, emulsion, direct<br>
polymerization, mechanical ground (low temperature, slicing process and air flow<br>
crush), and the like. These processes, however, typically suffer from such<br>
drawbacks as technical complexity, high cost and high energy consumption,<br>
irregular powder shape, large particle size and wide distribution of particle size,<br>
rendering significant difficulty in their practical application.<br>
It is disclosed in European Patent No. EP 1636292 that polyamide spherical<br>
particles were made by emulsion polymerization. It is disclosed in WO 03097228<br>
that polyamide spherical particles were made by interfacial polycondensation.<br>
However, these two processes are not suitable for industrial application for their<br>
process complexity and the need of a great deal of solvent and dispersant.<br><br>
A method is disclosed in Chinese Patent No. CN1624025 wherein a polyamide<br>
powder was obtained by mixing polyamide granules and a water soluble polymer to<br>
give a co-blend with polyamide as the dispersed phase and the water soluble<br>
polymer as the continuous phase, and then removing the water soluble polymer<br>
with water. While this method is desirable in industrialized manufacture, the<br>
preparation of polyamide powder used as the raw material requires consumption of<br>
a lot of energy.<br>

Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
Figure I shows the micrograph of the scanning electronic microscope (SEM) of<br>
the nylon 6 microspheres prepared according to Example 1 of the present invention,<br>
at a magnification of 100x.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In comparison with the prior art, a significant feature of the invention is the<br>
preparation of a polymer alloy of free radical polymer/polyamide by means of free<br>
radical polymerization and anionic ring-opening polymerization respectively in a<br>
continuous in-situ polymerization mode. A lactam is used as the solvent of the<br>
radically polymerizable monomer in the system, and the radically polymerizable<br>
monomer and the lactam monomer are polymerized separately in-situ by means of<br>
continuous solution radical polymerization and anionic ring-opening<br>
polymerization, to give an alloy of these monomers. In actuality, a number of free<br>
radical polymers per se are not soluble in lactam monomers , so that no polymer<br>
alloy of free radical polymer/polyamide can be obtained in-situ by way of anionic<br>
ring-opening polymerization. However, in accordance with the method disclosed in<br>
the present invention, a mixture of free radical polymer/lactam monomer obtained<br>
by free radical polymerization is a clear and stable system, and the presence of free<br>
radical polymer has no impact on the the anionic ring-opening polymerization of<br>
the lactam monomer.<br>
Another significant, also essential feature of the invention is the preparation of<br>
spherical nylon particles with regular shapes by means of phase-reversal. In general,<br>
in an alloy system of two polymers, the high-content polymer is present as a<br>
continuous phase, while the low-content polymer is present as a dispersed phase.<br>
The term "phase-reversal" means a situation in which the low-content polymer<br>
exists as a continuous phase, while the high-content polymer exists as a dispersed<br><br>
phase. After an extensive study, the inventors have found that in the polymer alloy<br>
system of free radical polymer/polyamide according to the invention,<br>
phase-reversal starts when the content of the free radical polymer is extremely low,<br>
so that a structure is formed where the free radical polymer exists as the continuous<br>
phase, while the polyamide (nylon) exists as the dispersed phase. During the<br>
phase-reversal, the polyamide is present as spherical particles, while the free<br>
radical polymer exists in the interspace between spheres in the polyamide phase,<br>
due to the viscosity, interface strain, and the like. The polyamide phase exists as<br>
regular spheres in this particular phase structure. Nylon microspheres with regular<br>
spherical shape can be prepared by dissolving a free radical polymer in a suitable<br>
organic solvent, followed by washing and drying.<br>
Yet another feature of the invention is the capability of controlling the size of<br>
nylon spheres by tailoring the ratio of the contents of free radical polymer to lactam<br>
monomer. The size of the nylon spheres obtained is relatively large when the ratio<br>
of free radical polymer to lactam monomer is relatively low. As the ratio of free<br>
radical polymer to lactam monomer increases, the size of the nylon spheres<br>
decreases. In this way, nylon spheres with different particle sizes and particle size<br>
distributions can be obtained by modifying the proportions of the components of<br>
the polymer alloy, so that control over the size of nylon spheres can be achieved.<br>
More over, during the polymerization of the lactam, the molecular weight of the<br>
nylon obtained is higher at lower concentrations of the initiator and the activator<br>
based on the lactam; and the molecular weight of the nylon obtained decreases as<br>
the concentrations of the initiator and the activator increase. Thus, control over the<br>
molecular weight of the nylon microspheres can be achieved by modifying the<br>
concentrations of the initiator and the activator during the polymerization of the<br>
lactam.<br>
In the method for preparing nylon microspheres according to the invention, a<br>
mixture of a free radical polymer and a lactam monomer can be obtained by either<br>
of the following two ways: (l) a radically polymerizable monomer is dispersed in a<br>
molten lactam monomer, and a free radical initiator is added, so that the free radical<br><br>
polymerization of the radically polymerizable monomer is carried out, providing a<br>
mixture of a free radical polymer and the lactam monomer; or (I ') a mixture of a<br>
free radical polymer and a molten lactam monomer is provided. In other words, the<br>
mixture of a free radical polymer and a lactam monomer can be prepared either on<br>
spot (such as in step (1», or by mixing a ready-made free radical polymer and a<br>
molten lactam monomer (such as in step (l '».<br>
In a preferred embodiment, nylon microspheres are prepared in a continuous<br>
mode, wherein a mixture of a free radical polymer and a lactam monomer is<br>
prepared first by free radical polymerization as described in step (1), and then steps<br>
(2) and (3) are carried out to provide nylon microspheres. More over, the free<br>
radical polymer which is dissolved in a solvent and removed in step (3) may be<br>
recycled and used for mixing directly with the molten lactam monomer as described<br>
in step (I') in the subsequent production process, providing a mixture of the free<br>
radical polymer and the lactam monomer, and then steps (2) and (3) are carried out.<br>
In the preparation method according to the invention, the free radical<br>
polymerization in step (l) is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of<br>
60-150-':':. Depending on the type and amount of the free radical monomer, the time<br>
for the polymerization is typically 4-72 hours.<br>
In the preparation method according to the invention, the solvent used in step (3)<br>
for dissolving and removing the free radical polymer is selected from those capable<br>
of dissolving free radical polymers but incapable of dissolving nylon, including, for<br>
example, but not limited to acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), water, toluene, xylene,<br>
butanone, ethyl acetate, propionitrile or mixtures thereof. Suitable solvents can be<br>
readily chosen by those in the art to dissolve and remove the free radical polymer,<br>
so as to provide nylon microspheres.<br>
The method according to the invention has the main advantages as follows:<br>
(l) The production process is simple, the operation is easy, and the energy<br>
consumption and the production cost are low;<br>
(2) Some reagents used are recyclable, such as the solvent used to dissolve and<br><br>
remove the free radical polymer; and the free radical polymer dissolved is also<br>
recyclable;<br>
(3) The technique according to the invention can not only provide nylon<br>
microspheres with regular spherical shape, but also realize effective control over<br>
the particle size of the nylon microspheres, e.g. in the range of 0.1-500Jlm.<br>
Additionally, effective control over the molecular weight of the nylon microspheres<br>
can also be achieved, e.g. in the range of 10000-300000. Preferably, the weight<br>
average molecular weight of the nylon is in the range of 10000-80000, and the<br>
particle size of the nylon microspheres is in the range of 0.5-100Jlm. More<br>
preferably, the weight average molecular weight of the nylon is in the range of<br>
25000-60000, and the particle size of the nylon microspheres is in the range of<br>
1-50Jlm.<br>
Nylon microspheres with regular spherical shape can be obtained according to<br>
the method for the invention. More desirably, the particle size and the molecular<br>
weight of the nylon microspheres can be controlled by modifying the content of the<br>
free radical polymer.<br>
The nylon microspheres according to the invention can be used as powder<br>
coatings, and raw materials of rollforming molding and extrusion, and the like.<br>
The invention will be further described in the following specific examples. It is<br>
to be understood that these examples are provided for illustrating the invention only,<br>
without any intention to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The<br>
experiments described in the examples without indicating specific conditions are to<br>
be carried out in conventional way, or under conditions specified by manufacturers.<br>
