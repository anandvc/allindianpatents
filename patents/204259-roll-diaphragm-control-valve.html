ROLL DIAPHRAGM CONTROL VALVE<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to diaphragm control valves and, in particular, it concerns such a valve with a roll diaphragm that deforms equally in two directions.<br>
A large number of diapliragm control valves have been developed and are available from a variety of manufacturers, such as Bermad. Evron. Israel. In general these valves comprise an upstream side into which flow--s a fluid from a fluid source, and a downstream side from which fluid can exit for end use, such as irrigation apparatus, for example. In between the upstream and downstream sides of the valve is a valve seat, against which a valve plug can be sealingly seated. The valve plug slides into and out of a plug housing, and a diaphragm is secured to the valve plug which seals the control chamber from the downstream sides of the valve. The control chamber is fitted with a control port through which the fluid pressure in the control chamber is regulated. By controlling the fluid pressure in the control chamber, the valve plug can be forced against the valve seat to shut off flow of fluid from the upstream side to the downstream side, or the valve plug can be lifted from the valve seat to permit flow of fluid from the upstream side to the downstream side. Regulation of the fluid flow is accomplished by adjusting the fluid pressure in the control chamber so as to maintain the position of the plug in a position between fully open and fully closed.<br>
The range of displacement of the valve plug is directly related to the displacement properties of the diaphragm. That is, the valve plug can move only as much as the diaphragm will allow. The larger the diaphragm, the greater the displacement of the valve plug and therefore the larger the opening through which fluid may flow. In valves of the this t}pe using substantially planar or flat diaphragms that are deformed under pressure so as to be displaced between the open and closed positions, the ratio of valve plug displacement to physical diameter of the diaphragm is relatively small, such that the size<br><br>
of a diaphragm necessary for use is a problem for any size pipe, and becomes particularly impraclical with larger pipes, for example.<br>
To overcome the problem of physical diameter, the art has turned to the use of what is known in the art as roll diaphragms. Diaphragms of this type are more compact in that they form substantially a sleeve around the valve plug. A problem encountered with this type of diaphragm is that (hey are particularly effective in actuating a valve plug in only one direction. Due to the amount of diaphragm material used to form the sleeve, when pressure is applied so as to change the direction of valve plug displacement, the unpredictable shapes into Avhich the roll diaphragm may change, as it turns back on itself, can possibly hinder the movement of other parts of the control valve. As a result, the valve plug must be mechanically biased in one direction (usually closed). There is therefore a need for a diaphragm control valve with a non-planar diaphragm that affects bi-directional displacement of a valve plug by way of fluid pressure.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is diaphragm control valve wnth a roll diaphragm that defonns equally in two directions.<br>
The principles and operation of diaphragm control valve according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.<br>
By way of introduction, the discussion herein is with regard to two preferred embodiments of the present invention. While there are structure differences between the<br><br>
two embodiments, the principles of operation according to the teachings of the present invention are the same in both embodiments.<br>
The present invention provides an improved diaphragm control valve with a simplified construction that has significant advantages over prior art diaphragm control valves. Further, the present invention provides substantially straight-through fluid flow which enables a high flow capacity with minimal pressure loss. While the preferred embodiments discussed herein are intended for fabrication from molded polymers, the principles of the present invention may be applied with equal benefit to valves constmcted of any suitable material.<br>
Valves of the present invention have a diaphragm which deforms in response to a difference in pressure, between the control chamber side of the diaphragm and the downstream side of the diaphragm. The diaphragm inflates, rolls and changes shape in both directions. That is to say, the diaphragm deforms both towards the control chamber side and towards the downstream side. The non-planar configuration of the diaphragm allows for a long range of displacement into and out of the control chamber, thereby providing a long stroke for the valve plug within the valve body.<br>
Unlike the roll diaphragms of prior art, which have curves with short radii and portions of the diaphragm turn back on itself so as to contact other portions of the diaphragm, the roll diaphragm of the present invention, when standing in a non-stressed state, is substantially an annulus that assumes a shape with a cross section that is substantially "S" shaped that does not fold over on itself That is to say, the diaphragm 200 is both axially non-overlapping and rotationally symmetrical. As illustrated in Figure 12, the substantially S shaped cross section is configured with a first curve 210 and a second curve 212, with the first curve and the second curve being interconnected. That is to say, the diaphragm extends from a first attacliment bead 220 substantially radially 222 in a first direction through a first cur\'e 210 continues substantially non-radially in a second direction 224 through a second curve 212 and continues in a substantially radial direction 226 terminating in a second attachment bead 228. The interconnectedness may be such that the two curves are spaced a distance apart, as illustrated here in region 224. Alternatively the interconnectedness may be such that the two curves are contiguous, that<br><br>
IS to say region 214 may be implemented as a pomt of inflection between two curves. Thus configured, the longitudinal distance 230 between the central plane of the first attachment bead and the central plane of the second attachment bead is at least 20 percent of the diameter 232 of the diaphragm. This alloAvs for an overall displacement in both directions equal to at least 40 percent 240 (Figure 13) of the diameter of the diaphragm. The ratio of the thickness 220 of the diaphragm 200 to the radial distance 242 between the parallel cylinders upon which the two attacliment beads he falls within a range of 1:4 to 1:7 and is preferably about 1:5. As a result of this thickness the radius of each of the curves is large in relation to the curves of conventional roll diaphragms, as mentioned above. As illustrated in Figure 13 the diaphragm of the present invention will assume substantially min or image cross section when fully extended in each direction. Configured thusly, when pressure is applied to the diaphragm it will deform substantially unifonnly in either direction in such a manner that substantially no portion of the diaphragm comes into contact with another portion of the diaphragm. This results in a larger diaphragm surface area upon which pressure may be applied that is provided by the roll diaphragms on prior art. Further, in a preferred case in which a reinforcing layer (generally of fabric) is incorporated into the diaphragm. the thickness of the elastomer is preferably distributed substantially equally on both sides of the reinforcing layer, diaphragm displacement is substantially equal in either direction for equal amounts of pressure. This results in a diaphragm that is able to withstand pressure applied from either side, unlike roll diaphragms of prior art that have an asymmetric configuration of elastomer on the reinforcing layer.<br>
Figures 6a-6g, in series, illustrate defomiation of the diaphragm 200 as the valve plug 30 moves from a closed position with substantially no pressure being applied (6a) to an open position (6d) and from an open position (6e) to a closed position (6g).<br>
As illustrated in Figures 6 and 6a, the valve plug sealing surface 134 is seated against the valve seat 110 and the valve is closed, i.e., no fluid can flow from the upstream port 18 to the downstream port 16. The diameter of the valve plug 30 at its bottom surface 132, i.e., the portion which seats against the valve seat 110, is less than the diameter of the control chamber 60 above the diaphragm 200, i.e., the inside diameter<br><br>
 the cover 70. The difference in diameters means that pressure is applied surfaces with differing surface areas. Therefore, if the pressure inside the control chamber 60 is the same as the pressure in the upstream port 18, the net force on the control chamber side of the diaphragm 60 and the valve plug 30, which has the greater surface area, (i.e., the force pushing the valve plug 30 against the valve seat 110) is greater than the force on the upstream side of the valve plug 30 (i.e., the force .pushing the valve plug 30 away from the valve seat 110). It is also appreciated that the force pushing the valve plug 30 against the valve seat 110 may still be greater than the force pushing the valve plug 30 away from the valve seat 110, even if the pressure at the upstream side is slightly greater than the pressure inside control chamber 60. depending of course on the difference in the surface areas to which the pressure is applied and the magnitude of the pressure at the upstream side. It should be noted that the force of the spring 160 also adds to the force pushing the valve plug 30 against the valve seat 110. The pressure at the downstream port 16 may be atmospheric, for example.<br>
In Figure 6b, the pressure in the control chamber 60 is lowered by any one of the pressure control devices known in the art which is in fluid communication with the control port 62. In figure 6c, the pressure in the control chamber 60 is lowered to the point that the pressure at the upstream side acting on the lower portion 132 of the valve plug 30 overcomes the force pushing the valve plug 30 against the valve seat 110. and the valve plug 30 moves away from the valve seat 110. Once the valve plug 30 moves away from the valve seat 110, fluid flows from the upstream port 18 to the downstream port 16. This increases the pressure from the downstream side on the diaphragm 200, thereby further increasing the force which acts to push valve plug 30 away from valve seat 110, thus further opening the passage for fluid from upstream port 18 to downstream port 16. The pressure at the downstream port 16 acts against diaphragm 200 such that diaphragm 200 deforms into the control chamber 60 (6c), As is seen, the diaphragm support 150 prevents the diaphragm 200 from inflating inwards. It will be appreciated that the fluid flow may be regulated by adjusting the fluid pressure in the control chamber 60 so as to maintain the position of the valve plug 30 in a position between fully open and fully closed.<br><br>
Figure 60 Illustrates the valve 10 fully open. A comparison of Figures 6e6g illustrates the deformation of the diaphragm 200 as the valve plug 30 is displace from an open position to a closed position. The general operation of the two embodiments herein described are essentially the same.<br>
Further, the valve of the present invention has at least one structural element configured on the valve plug for controlling the inflation and rolling motion of the diaphragm. These structural elements include a cylindrical diaphragm support structure 150 extending from the top of the valve plug into the control chamber. In the preferred embodiment discussed here, the extension is in a direction that is substantially parallel to the axis of the valve plug. Thus, the diaphragm support structure moves together with the valve plug, unlike the prior art in which the diaphragm control structures are statically placed in the plug housing.<br>
The valve of the present invention also includes a flange-adapter with a substantially spherical interface which reduces or eliminates stress on the flange, adapter or inlet and outlet end couplings of the valve when attaching the upstream or downstream sides of the valve to piping.<br>
Referrins now to the drawings. Figure 1 clearlv shows a number of the structural elements of a first preferred embodiment of a diaphragm control valve 10 of the present invention. As illustrated here, the plug housing 50 extends from the valve body 12 such that an acute angle is formed by the longitudinal axis of the plug housing 50 and the longitudinal axis of the downstream port 16. Circumferentially spaced about the valve plug 30 are plug guide elements 32 and 34 that are configured to slidingly engage the guide ribs 52, which are circumferentially spaced about the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50. The plug housing cover 70 is configured so as to be secured by a cover ring 80. This cover ring 80 further serves to stiffen and strengthen the plug housing 50. The valve body 12 preferably includes a valve body bracket 20 for securing the valve body to a deployment surface (not shown) when necessary. It should be noted that the direction of fluid flow is indicated by arrow 2 in each of the figures where such indication is required<br>
The side elevation of Figure 2 is identical to Figure 1 and is numbered accordingly. Also shown, by non-limiting example, are three-inch 90 and four-inch 100 flanges and adapters, both of which are configured for connection to the exterior threads<br><br>
92 and 92' of the upstream 18 and downstream 16 ports respectively. It should be noted that flanges and adapters to fit substantially any size pipe is within the intention of the present invention.<br>
The assembled diaphragm control valve of Figure 3 illustrates the relative compactness of a valve of the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates major structural elements of the valve plug of this first embodiment of the present invention. More clearly show here are the plug guide elements 32 and 34. The plug guide elements are aligned in pairs of a top 32 and a bottom 34 guide element. As the valve plug 30 is inserted into the plug housing 50, the plug guide elements 32 and 34 are aligned Avith the guide ribs 52 configured on the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50. This configuration restricts rotational movement of the valve plug 30. Further, the extreme surface 46 of the plug guide elements 32 and 34 slidingly abuts the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50 thereby restricting latitudinal movement of the valve plug 50.<br>
Turning now to the general structure of the diaphragm control valve 10 of this first embodiment of the present invention with regard to Figure 5, the valve body 12 includes a cylindrical upstream port 18 and a cylindrical downstream port 16 each of which is threaded about an outside cylindrical surface 92 and 94 respectively so as to be attachable to flanged adapters, such as, but not limited to, three-inch 90 and four-inch 100 pipe flanges. Both the upstream 18 and downstream 16 ports further include threading 94 about an inside cylindrical surface so as to attachable to, for example, threaded pipe (not shown) and adapters for use with non-threaded PVC pipe (not shown). Valve 10 is illustrated here in connection to three-inch flanged adapters 90 and 90'. Configured within the valve body between the upstream 18 and downstream 16 ports is a valve seat 110. Extending from the valve body 12 at an orientation substantially perpendicular to the plane of the valve seat 110, is a substantially cylindrical plug housing 50. The terminal extremity 54 of the plug housing 50 is preferably configured about an inner surface for engagement with a plug housing cover 70 and threaded about an outer surface for engagement with the cover ring 80.<br>
Slidingly deployed within the plug housing 50 is a substantially cylindrical valve plug 30. As mentioned above, the valve plug includes plug guide elements 32 and 34 that<br><br>
engage the guide ribs 52 configured on the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50. Thus deployed, the valve plug 30 substantially limited to longitudinal movement along an axis 130 that is substantially perpendicular to the plane of the valve seat 110. The bottom surface 132 of the valve plug 30 includes a sealing surface 134 configured to align with the valve seat 110 such that when that valve plug is deployed in a closed position, as illustrated here in Figure 5. fluid is not allowed to, flow from the upstream port 18 to the downstream port 16 tlirough the valve seat 110. The sealing surface 110 of this first embodiment is preferably an elastomeric ring entrapped between the valve plug stem 140 and the valve plug body 142.<br>
Extending between the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50 and the valve plus 30 is a diaphragm 200. The diaphragm 200 seals the control chamber 60 from the downstream port 16, and flexibly defines, in concert with the top surface of the valve plug 30 and the interior surface of the plug housing cover 70, the varying volume of the control chamber 60, as will be discussed below.<br>
The diaphragm 200 is attached to the valve plug 30 by entrapment between a first set of attachment surfaces 202 configured on the valve plug body 142 and the valve plug top 144. The attachment surfaces of the diaphragm and the valve plug are configured such that the diaphragm 200 extends from the valve plug 30 substantially perpendicular to the cylindrical wall of the valve plug body 142. The diaphragm 200 is further attached to the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50 by entrapment between a second set of attachment surfaces 204 configured on the terminal extremity of the plug housing 50 and the plug housing cover 70. Here too, the attachment surfaces of the diaphragm 200, plug housing 50 and plug housing cover 70 are configured such that the diaphragm 200 extends from the entrapment surfaces 204 substantially perpendicular to the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50. The preformed substantially S shaped cross section of the diaphragm provides a uniform and predictable shape of shape as the diaplu'agm deforms betAveen an opening configuration and a closing configuration.<br>
The valve plug top 144 is configured with a substantially cylindrical outer surface that extend above the diaphragm into the control chamber thereby forming a diaphragm support structure 150 as mentioned above. The extreme terminal surface 152 of the valve plug top 150 is configured so as to contact the plug housing cover 70 when the valve plug<br><br>
30 is displaced to the open position, thereby establishing an upper limit of the longitudinal displacement of the valve plug 30. Deployed between the valve plug top 150 and the plug housing cover 70 is a spring 160 which biases the valve plug 30 toward the valve seat 110 so as to augment the pressure applied to the valve plug 30 in the closed position, thereb)" enhancing the sealing contact between the sealing surface 134 of the valve plug 30 and the valve seat 110.<br>
For ease of assembly and maintenance, the diaphragm 200 and the major structural element of the valve plug 30 are held in p)lace by entrapment on the valve plug stem 140, behveen the bottom surface 132 of the valve plug stem 140 and the valve plug retaining nutl48. Once assembled the valve plug 300 is inserted into the plug housing 50 and the diaphragm 200 is attached to the plug housing 50 as the cover 70 is installed.<br>
Reference is now made to a second preferred embodiment, generally referred to by 300, of the present invention is Figure 6. As illustrated here, the valve body 12, upstream 18 and downstream 16 ports, the valve seat 110, plug-housing 50 and cover ring 80 are essentially the same as describe with regard to the first embodiment above and are numbered correspondingly.<br>
A major feature of this second embodiment is that the valve plug 330 and the diaphragm 310 are integrally formed as a single structural element. This is achieved by the valve plug 330 being configured with attachment elements such that the preferably elastomeric material of the diaphragm 310 is molded directly onto the valve plug 330. The attachment elements illustrated here by non-limiting example only, include top 312 and bottom 314 grooves that circumscribe the valve plug 330 and a plurality of radially spaced apart passages 316 that extend longitudinally through the cylindrical wall 332 of the valve plug 330 so as to connect the top 312 and bottom 314 grooves. In this embodiment, the elastomeric material molded into the bottom groove 314 forms the valve plug sealing surface 318.<br>
The diaphragm 310 is attached to the cylindrical wall of the plug housing 50 by entrapment between a set of attachment surfaces 320 configured on the terminal extremity of the plug housing 50 and the plug housing cover 70. As in the first preferred embodiment, the attachment surfaces of the diaphragm 310, plug housing 50 and plug housing cover 70 are configured such that the diaphragm 310 extends from the from the<br><br>
attachment suriaces 320 substantially perpendicular to the cylindrical wall ol the plug liousing 50. The diaphragm 310 is configured such that a radial length of the diaphragm 310 between the attachment region 320 and the valve plug is greater than a radial distance 322 between the attachment region 320 and valve plug 330. This "excess" diaphragm material allows the diaphragm 310 to deform as the valve plug is displaced between the open and closed positions, as discussed above.<br>
The plug housing 50 includes guide ribs 350 as discussed with regard to the first embodiment above. The valve plug 330 includes single corresponding valve plug guide elements 352 configured around the bottom region of the cylindrical wall of the valve plug 330. Additionally the valve plug 330 includes inner plug guides 354 configured to align with a substantially cylindrical cover guide element 360 extending longitudinally from the plug housing cover 70. The cover guide element 360 preferably includes air holes 362 to allow equalizntion of pressure when the valve plug 330 is displaced into the plug housing 400 to an open position.<br>
The plug housing cover 70 may include valve plug stoppers 370 configured to contact the extreme terminal surface 334 of the valve plug 330, thereby stopping further longitudinal displacement of the valve plug into the plug housing. Turning to the general operation of the present invention, discussed with regard to the second preferred embodiment 300. The displacement of the valve plug 330 is responsive to a pressure differential between the control chamber 400 and the downstream port 16. The pressure in the control chamber 400 may be varied by any of a number of control devices known in the art that are responsive to a variety parameters such as but not limited to, pressure is a single pressurized region, and pressure differential between tvvo or more pressurized regions, for example, inlet pressure and/or outlet pressure and/or other parameters. The details of various control devices are well known in the art, and are not part of the present invention. The change in pressure in the control chamber may be affected by fluid communication with the control chamber 400 through a control port 402. As illustrated here, by non-limiting example, the control port 402 is included in the plug housing cover 70.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 9 which illustrates a third preferred embodiment of a diaphragm control valve 500 of the present invention. The diaphragm control valve<br><br>
500 of this embodiment is constructed essentially the same as diaphragm control valve 300 of the second embodiment, with corresponding elements being con-espondinsly numbered. Diaphragm control valve 500 differs from diaphragm control valve 300 in that diaphragm control valve 500 further includes a flow stem 502 deployed within the control chamber 400. The flow stem 502 is preferably male-threaded and extends through the plug housing cover 70 interconnecting with, a flow handle 504. An 0-ring 506 preferably seals the flow stem 502 with respect to the plug housing cover 70. A flow stem stopper 508 is preferably tlireadedly attached to flow stem 502. By appropriate turning of the flow handle 504, the flow stem stopper 508 can be moved up or down the flow stem 502. Preferably, the flow the flow stem stopper 508 is configured with flow stem stopper ribs 510 which substantially prevent rotation of the flow stem stopper 508 within the cover guide element 360. The purpose of flow stem stopper 508 is to vary the limit of travel of valve plug 330 and thereby regulate the maximum flow of a fluid through the valve 500.<br>
Looking now at Figures 10 and 11 (detail of Figure 10) that illustrate a four-inch flange 100 and adapter 600, which serves as a non-limiting example of a flange and adapter configuration that is useful with any of the diaphragm control valves of the present invention described herein. It should be noted that the 3 inch and 4 inch flange assemblies are merely given as examples, and it will be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented for substantially any desired pipe diameter, from very small diameters up to very large diameters.. The flange 100 and adapter 600 are illustrated together with the second embodiment of a diaphragm control valve 300. It should be further noted that use of the flange and adapter of the present invention need not be limited to use solely with valve bodies of the present invention, and would be equally beneficial for any application where a flange fitting is required. The adapter 600 preferably screws on to the external flange adapter threads 92 and 92' at the upstream 18 or downstream 16 port of the valve body 12. The connection may be sealed with an 0-ring 610.<br>
The flange 100 fits over the adapter 600. The flange 100 is configured with a generally spherical surface 102 which abuts a con-espondingly shaped spherical surface 602 configured on the adapter 600. The generally spherical interface between the flange<br><br>
100 and the adapter 600 permits the flange 100 to freely move substantially spherically about the adapter, and to rotate about a longitudinal axis 604 of the upstream and downstream, valve body ports 18 and 16. This permits attaching the upstream or downstream ports 18 or 16 of the valve body to the piping without placing stress on flange 100, adapter 600 or valve body. This also allows rotating the flange 100 freely about longitudinal axis 604, so as to permit easy alignment of the mounting holes 104 of the flange 100 with the mounting holes or bolt studs of the pipeline (not shown).<br>
The above described flange and adapter are intended for fabrication from polymer materials, such as glass-filled Nylon, by way of non-limiting example, so as to provide light weight, yet strong, components. If however, a particular application requires a stronger flange, such as one fabricated from metal, for example, the flange illustrated in Figure 12 provides an alternative embodiment of a flange of the present invention. Due to the strength of the material from which the flange is fabricated, the flange body 650 is configured as a relatively narrow ring, thereby conserving weight. Circumferentially spaced about the flange body 650 are a plurality of radially elongated bolt slots 652 configured to allow alignment with corresponding attachment elements (boh holes or bolt studs) of attachment interface components of varying diameters. Note that the adapter interface surface 660 of this flange embodiment is configured as a substantially spherical surface so as to abut the corresponding surface of the flange adapters of the present invention as described above.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above descriptions are intended only to serve as examples, and that many other embodiments are possible within the spirit and the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
