				<td>The present invention relates to a method of producing contact connectors of electrically conductive material for terminal devices designed to connect electrically insulated wires, and these contact connectors are provided with a separable connecting links with slotted end pieces for receiving line ends, whereby elastic parallel jumpering prongs projecting from the end pieces each have a contact surface on their free ends.<br>
Contact connectors of this type are known, for example, from EP 0 370 380 from the same applicant, and can be used in a terminal device, such as a terminal block used in data communication, both as a break contact and a through contact.<br>
As is known, huge numbers of contact connectors of the type mentioned above are required, meaning that their production is of immense economic importance.<br>
Previous production methods have not been sufficient, especially when a number of contact connectors in strips which have been cut to length are manually dipped into the electroplating bath and subsequently removed.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to considerably improve such known methods in order to simplify and reduce the cost of production of such contact connectors in accordance with modern needs.<br>
This is achieved according to the invention in that the contact connectors, with their curved pieces and with the edge strip maintained, are stamped out of the endless material strip, bent to a certain extent at least, electroplated and bent into their final shape.<br>
In a preferable embodiment of the method according to the invention, the intermediate product is bent again after stamping/ prebending, electroplating and bending to the final shape.<br>
The intermediate product is cut into lengths immediately before installation, which provides an<br>
additional improvement for storage purposes in addition to electroplating in a continuous operation.<br>
In doing so, at least the contact surfaces of the prongs can be prebent to the curved pieces of the contact connectors which are stamped out of an endless strip of material and held by at least one edge strip, or the contact surfaces can be bent into their final shape to the curved pieces of the contact connector which are stamped out of an endless strip of material and held by at least one edge strip except for one of the prongs.<br>
Preferably, the said edge strip or strips is or are then separated from the terminal device after or during installation.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to contact connectors produced according to the method according to the invention.<br>
An example of an embodiment of the method is described in more detail below on the basis of the drawings. The following is shown:<br>
Pig. 1 a diagram of a contact connector, for the purpose of describing the method of production;<br>
Tig. 2 a few contact connectors with band-shaped curved pieces; and<br>
Fig. 3 a diagram of the contact connectors produced according to the method according to the invention, still connected and during installation in a terminal device.<br>
The contact connector 1 according to the invention and made of electrically conductive material for terminal devices is used to connect electrically insulated wires as shown in Fig. 1 and comprises a separable connecting link 2 which terminates in a wide-area receiving slot 4 for end pieces 5 provided with wire ends (not shown) , which are located on at least nearly parallel levels. In this case, opposing elastic prongs 6,6' project from the end parts 5 at the sides of the legs 3, and the free ends of both these prongs 6,6' are provided with contact surfaces 7 which are in contact when subject to the spring tension of the prongs 6,6'.<br>
Such a contact connector	1 forms a through contact. If<br>
the contact connector 1	is used as a break contact,<br>
solely separating one	leg 3 at the point 8 is<br>
necessary.<br>
In order to produce such contact connectors, the curved pieces 1' of the contact connectors are first stamped out of an endless band 20 with a modular gap according to the contact clearance of the terminal device 10 (Fig. 3), whereby edge strips 21 hold the curved pieces together.<br>
At least the contact surfaces 7 of the prongs are then prebent toward the curved pieces 1" of the contact connectors 1 which are stamped out of an endless material strip 20 and held by at least one edge strip 21,21', as can be seen in Fig. 2, or the contact connectors are bent into their final shape toward the prongs 6, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The endless strip of material prepared in this way is then electroplated in a continuous operation.<br>
The contact connectors can then be bent into their final shape.<br>
Subsequently, the terminal device 10, in this case a terminal block with comb blocks 14 and grooves 15 for the wires (not shown) , can be installed from the bent final product while cutting the edge strips 21,21' into lengths and removing them.<br>
The fact that the intermediate product is bent again after stamping, prebending, electroplating and final bending is decisive for the present invention.<br>
Protection as follows is sought:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A method  of  producing  contact  connectors  of<br>
electrically conductive material for connecting<br>
electrically insulated wires,  provided with  a<br>
separable connecting link (2) with slotted (4) end<br>
pieces (5) for receiving the wire ends, whereby<br>
elastic parallel jumpering prongs (6,6'), each of<br>
which is provided with a contact surface (7) on<br>
its free end, project from the end pieces (5),<br>
characterized in that<br>
the contact connectors, with their curved pieces and maintaining the edge strip, are stamped out of a strip of endless material and then bent to a certain extent at least, electroplated and subsequently bent into their final shape.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in<br>
that the intermediate product is bent again after<br>
stamping, prebending, electroplating and bending<br>
to its final shape.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in<br>
that at least the contact surfaces of the prongs<br>
(6,6') are prebent to the curved pieces (I1) of<br>
the contact connectors  (1)  stamped out of an<br><br><br>
endless strip of material (20) and held by at least one edge strip (21,21').<br>
4.	A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in<br>
that the contact connectors (1), excluding one of<br>
the prongs (6,6') are bent into their final shape<br>
at the curved pieces  (11)  stamped out of an<br>
endless strip of material  (20) and held by at<br>
least one edge strip (21,21').<br>
5.	Contact  connectors  produced  according  to  the<br>
method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1<br>
to 4.<br>
6.	A method of producing contact connectors of electrically<br>
conductive material for connecting electrically insulated<br>
wires, such as hereinbefore described with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings. <br></td>
