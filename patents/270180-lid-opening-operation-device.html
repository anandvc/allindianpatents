BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]    A mode for carrying out the present invention is explained below by<br>
reference to one embodiment of the present invention shown in the attached<br>
drawings.<br>
EMBODIMENT 1<br>
[0011]    FIG. 1 to FIG. 11 show one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0012]    The fore-and-aft and left-and-right directions in the embodiment are with<br><br>
respect to the traveling direction of a motorcycle.<br>
[0013] First, in FIG. 1, a body cover 15 of, for example, a scooter type motorcycle includes a leg shield 17 as a box---~~iing member rising from the front end of a step floor 16, and a box portion 1~3 projecting rearward is formed integrally with the leg shield 17. A lower end part of a lid 18 for closing a rear end opening of the box portion 17a so that it can be opened and closed is supported on the box portion 17a so that it can pivot in the fore-and-aft direction, and a recess 19 is provided in an upper middle part of the lid 18 so as to open on the upper edge side of the lid 18. Disposed in the recess 19 are a cylinder lock 20 and an operating knob 21, the operating knob 21 releasing a closed locked state of the lid 18 by being pushed in when the cylinder lock 20 is subjected to an unlocking operation. A hook 23, which is positioned above the cylinder lock 20 when the lid 18 is in a closed state, is provided on the leg shield 17 so as to enable a shopping bag, etc. to be hung thereon, and a main switch 24 is disposed on an upper right part of the leg shield 17.<br>
[0014] In FIG. 2 to FIG. 5, the cylinder lock 20 includes a body 27 fixed to the lid 18 and a rotor 28 pivotably inserted into the body 27. The body 27 integrally has a body main portion 27a formed into a substantially cylindrical shape, a collar portion 27b protruding outward from the rear end of the body main portion 27a, and a pair of guide portions 27c and 27c extending downward in parallel from the collar portion 27b when the lid 18 is in a closed state; a cylinder hole 29 having a circular cross-section is provided in a rear part of the body main portion 27a, a recess 30 is provided in a front part of the body main portion 27a so as to open on an upper side face of the body main portion 27a while communicating with the cylinder hole 29, and a body cover 31 for closing the recess 30 is mounted on a front side face of the body main portion 27a.<br>
[0015] The rotor 28 is pivotably fitted into the cylinder hole 29 so that its rear part is disposed to the rear of the collar portion 27b and its front part is disposed in  the   recess  30;  this  rotor 28  is  provided  with  an  opening  32  having  a<br><br>
substantially circular cross-section and opening at the rear end of the rotor 28, and with a key hole 33, into which a key (not illustrated) can be inserted, having its rear end communicating with the front end :^ tne opening 32, and the front end of the key hole 33 is closed. A cap 35 is mounted at the rear end of the rotor 28, the cap 35 being formed into a dish shape with an insertion hole 34 corresponding to the key hole 33, and a shutter plate 36 disposed within the opening 32 is supported on the rotor 28 via a support shaft 38 while being urged by a spring 37 in a direction that closes the insertion hole 34. The key (not illustrated) can thus be inserted into the key hole 33 via the insertion hole 34 while pressing and pivoting the shutter plate 36 toward the opening side. [0016] A pair of engagement grooves 41 and 41 are provided on an inside face of the cylinder hole 29, the engagement grooves 41 and 41 extending in the axial direction of the cylinder hole 29, and a plurality of tumblers 42 are mounted on the rotor 28, the tumblers 42 being spring-biased in a direction in which they engage with the engagement grooves 41. In a state in which the key is not inserted into the key hole 33, the tumblers 42 engage with the engagement grooves 41, thus preventing the rotor 28 from pivoting within the cylinder hole 29, and when the key is inserted into the key hole 33, it operates so as to release the engagement of the tumblers 42 with the engagement grooves 41, thus allowing pivoting of the rotor 28 within the cylinder hole 29. [0017] Referring to FIG. 2, the rotor 28 is at a locked position PI in a state in which the tumblers 42 are engaged with the engagement grooves 41, can be pivoted to a unlocked position P2, which is spaced from the locked position PI by an angle a in the anticlockwise direction, by a pivoting operation in a state in which the key is inserted into the key hole 33 so as to release the engagement of the tumblers 42 with the engagement grooves 41, and can be further pivoted from the unlocked position P2 to an open position P3, which is spaced from the unlocked position P2 by an angle p in the anticlockwise direction on the side opposite to the locked position P1 relative to the unlocked position P2.<br><br>
[0018] Furthermore, a rear part of the body 27 is covered with a cover 43 having an outer shape substantially corresponding to the outer shape of the collar portion 27b of the body 27, and this cc\e- 43 is mounted on the collar portion 27b. Moreover, a circular window 44 is provided in the cover 43, part of the cap 35 at the rear end of the rotor 28 being fitted into the circular window 44. [0019] A lid lock mechanism 22 is provided between the box portion 17a of the leg shield 17 and the lid 18, that is, in this embodiment between the lid 18 and the rotor 28 supported on the body 27 fixed to the lid 18, the lid lock mechanism 22 releasing engagement with the box portion 17a side so as to enable the lid 18 to be opened in response to the rotor 28 of the cylinder lock 20 pivoting to the open position P3.<br>
[0020] Referring in addition to FIG. 6, the lid lock mechanism 22 includes a slider 45 running slidably through a through hole 50 provided in the body cover 31 and having at the outer end an engagement portion 45a detachably engaging with the box portion 17a side of the leg shield 17, a spring 46 provided in a compressed state between the slider 45 and the body main portion 27a so as to spring-bias the engagement portion 45a so that it projects outward in the radial direction of the body main portion 27a, an abutment arm 47 that projects toward the rotor 28 side from an inner end part of the slider 45 and that is provided integrally with the slider 45, and a restricting projection 48 and a pressing projection 49 that are provided integrally with the front end of the rotor 28 and that can abut against the abutment arm 47.<br>
[0021] The slider 45 is slidably fitted into a guide recess 51 provided in an inner face at the front end of the body main portion 27a along one diameter of the body main portion 27a, and the spring 46, which is in a coiled form, is provided in a compressed state between the body main portion 27a and the slider 45 so as to surround a pin 52 projectingly and integrally provided on the body main portion 27a while facing the inner end of the slider 45. [0022]    The restricting projection 48 is projectingly provided on the rotor 28 so<br>
7<br><br>
as to be coaxial therewith, and in a state in which the rotor 28 is at the locked position P1 as shown in FIG. 6 and in a state in which the rotor 28 is at the unlocked position P2 as shown in FIG. 7, the "sstricting projection 48 abuts against the abutment projection 47 of the slider 45 from a direction opposite to that in which it is urged by the spring 46, thus determining a projection end position for the slider 45.<br>
[0023] Furthermore, the pressing projection 49 is projectingly provided at the rear end of the rotor 28 at a position offset from the pivot center of the rotor 28; when the rotor 28 is at the locked position P1 shown in FIG. 6, the pressing projection 49 does not abut against the abutment projection 47, but when the rotor 28 is pivoted to the unlocked position P2 shown in FIG. 7 the pressing projection 49 abuts against the abutment projection 47 from a direction opposite to that in which it is urged by the spring 46, and when the rotor 28 is pivoted from the unlocked position P2 shown in FIG. 7 to the open position P3 shown in FIG. 8 a pressing force acts on the abutment projection 47, thus making the slider 45 slide toward the side on which the slider 45 is housed within the body main portion 27a against the spring bias force of the spring 46, and thereby releasing an engaged state of the lid 18 with the box portion 17a and enabling the lid 18 to be opened.<br>
[0024] A notch 53 is provided in a lower part of the cover 43 mounted on the rear part of the body 27, and an upper part of the operating knob 21 is inserted within the cover 43 via the notch 53 so that it can slide in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the rotor 28.<br>
[0025] A pair of guide grooves 54 and 54 are provided in a face of the collar portion 27b of the body 27 on the cover 43 side, the guide grooves 54 and 54 extending vertically on opposite sides of the cylinder hole 29, and stoppers 55 and 55 are integrally provided so as to project rearward from the lower ends of the guide grooves 54. The operating knob 21 can slide in a vertical direction perpendicular to the pivot center of the rotor 28 while being guided by the guide<br>
8<br><br>
P'Tc^ft c'f Amesocl'me^^t<br>
grooves 54 and the two guide portions 27c of the body 27, and a return spring 56 is provided in a compressed state between the body 27 and the operating knob 21, the return spring 56 exhibiting a spring force n a direction in which the operating knob 21 is pushed downward. The downwardly moving end of the operating knob 21 is restricted by the operating knob 21 abutting against the two stopper portions 55 from above.<br>
[0026] Referring in addition to FIG. 9, a pressure-receiving portion 60 and a restricting portion 61 are projectingly provided on the rotor 28, the pressure-receiving portion 60 and the restricting portion 61 being spaced in the peripheral direction and projecting radially outward so as to be in sliding contact with the collar portion 27b of the body 27 from the rear, and first and second pressing portions 62 and 63 are provided with a gap therebetween on the operating knob 21 in a portion corresponding to the outer periphery of the rotor 28. [0027] The pressure-receiving portion 60 and the restricting portion 61 therefore have outer peripheral faces that follow a first imaginary circle CI with the same radii and the center at the pivot center of the rotor 28, and when the<br>
r<br>
rotor 28 is at the (u-rillocked position P^, the restricting portion 61 extends 
 <br>
non-pushing-in operation state, and the radius of the second imaginary circle C2 is set so as to be slightly larger than the radius of the first imaginary circle CI. Furthermore, the second pressing portion 63 c- :ne operating knob 21 is disposed at a position that faces the rotor 28 frorr. the lower right so that the extremity of the second pressing portion 63 is on the second imaginary circle C2 when the operating knob 21 is in the non-pushing-in operation state, and a side face of the second pressing portion 63 on the first pressing portion 62 side is formed as a flat restricting face 66 against which the restricting portion 61 of the rotor 28 can abut.<br>
[0029] Pushing in the operating knob 21 when the rotor 28 is at the locked position P1 makes the pressing face 65 at the extremity of the first pressing portion 62 of the operating knob 21 abut against the outer periphery of the extremity of the pressure-receiving portion 60 of the rotor 28, thus preventing a pushing-in operation of the operating knob 21 and making a pressing force directed toward the pivot center side of the rotor 28 act on the rotor 28. Pivoting the rotor 28 from the locked position PI to the unlocked position P2 by operation of the key moves the pressure-receiving portion 60 of the rotor 28 to a position slightly beyond the second pressing portion 63 of the operating knob 21 as shown in FIG. 10, and moves the restricting portion 61 to a position between the first and second pressing portions 62 and 63 of the operating knob 21. In this state, when the operating knob 21 is pushed in, the pressure-receiving portion 60 is pushed by the second pressing portion 63 and the rotor 28 is pivoted to the open position P3 shown in FIG. 11; when the rotor 28 pivots to the open position P3, the restricting portion 61 of the rotor 28 abuts against the restricting face 66 of the operating knob 21, thus preventing the rotor 28 from pivoting further than this.<br>
[0030] That is, the rotor 28 is provided with the pressure-receiving portion 60, against which the first and second pressing portions 62 and 63 provided on the operating knob 21 abut in response to a pushing-in operation of the operating<br>
10<br><br>
knob 21; the first pressing portion 62, the second pressing portion 63, and the pressure-receiving portion 60 are formed so that, when the rotor 28 is at the locked position PI and the operating knob 21 s pressed, a pressing force directed toward the pivot center side of the rotor 28 acts from the operating knob 21 on the rotor 28, and when the rotor 28 is at the unlocked position P2 and the operating knob 21 is pushed in, a force pivoting the rotor 28 from the unlocked position P2 to the open position P3 side acts from the operating knob 21 on the rotor 28.<br>
[0031] Furthermore, the rotor 28 can be pivoted in one step from the locked position P1 via the unlocked position P2 to the open position P3 by operation of the key, and by so doing the lid 18 can be opened.<br>
[0032] The operation of this embodiment is now explained. When the rotor 28 of the cylinder lock 20 is at the locked position PI, a pressing force due to the operating knob 21 being pushed in acts on the rotor 28 toward the pivot center of the rotor 28, a pivoting force from the operating knob 21 is not transmitted to the rotor 28, and pushing in of the operating knob 21 is prevented. Moreover, in accordance with a simple arrangement with few components, in which only the shapes of the pressure-receiving portion 60 provided on the rotor 28 and the first and second pressing portions 62 and 63 provided on the operating knob 21 are designed, it is possible to prevent a large load from acting on the tumblers 42 even when a pushing-in operation of the operating knob 21 is carried out when the rotor 28 of the cylinder lock 20 is at the locked position PI. [0033] Although an embodiment of the present invention has been explained above, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and may be modified in a variety of ways as long as the modifications do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention described in Claims on the following page.<br>
