Description<br>
Power semiconductor module with load connecting elements fitted<br>
on a circuit mount<br>
The invention relates to a power semiconductor module as<br>
claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 1. The<br>
invention also relates to a housing for a power semiconductor<br>
module as claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 13.<br>
Power semiconductor modules require load current connections,<br>
which are passed to the outside, as an external interface for<br>
making electrical contact with the modules. In this case,<br>
depending on the power levels, external connections with<br>
relatively large cross sections may occur, and there is<br>
therefore a requirement for the load current connections to be<br>
highly robust. There is also a need to equip the load current<br>
connections with different conductor connecting contours, so<br>
that different cables or rail systems can be connected as<br>
required. On the side within the module, the load current<br>
connections must be electrically and mechanically connected to<br>
a less robust circuit mount, which is inserted in a housing, in<br>
general a plastic housing, and is fitted with components, in<br>
particular power semiconductors. In this case, because of the<br>
high thermal conductivity and thermal coefficients of expansion<br>
of ceramic circuit mounts, so-called DCB (Direct Copper Bonded)<br>
substrates are preferably used for power semiconductors, which<br>
are composed of a ceramic insulator (aluminum oxide or aluminum<br>
nitride) on which a thin layer of pure copper is applied so<br>
that it adheres strongly. In particular, the high thermal<br>
conductivity together with the high thermal capacity and heat<br>
spreading of the copper coating and a coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion of the DCB substrate close to that of silicon make<br>
DCB substrates virtually indispensable for power electronics,<br>
despite their disadvantages in terms of robustness. When so-<br>
called naked semiconductor chips are mounted directly on the<br><br>
- la -<br>
circuit mount, the electrical connection between the<br>
semiconductor chips and the circuit mount is normally made by<br>
bonding by means of thin<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
Al or AG wires. The electrical connection from the circuit<br>
mounted to the external load current connection is made using<br>
the same connecting technique. This admittedly results in a<br>
certain amount of mechanical decoupling between the load<br>
current connection and the circuit mount but, in principle, the<br>
different longitudinal coefficients .of expansion of Al bonding<br>
wire (23*10~6) and DCB (7*10~7) result in restrictions in<br>
temperature life tests, since bonding wires may become<br>
detached. In any case, however, the introduction of large<br>
conductor connecting forces to the circuit mount should be<br>
avoided, and a permanent connection should be ensured between<br>
the circuit mount and the load current connection.<br>
It is known from DE 197 19 703 for outer load current<br>
connections which project outwards to be injection molded in<br>
the module housing, with specific tabs in the load connecting<br>
conductor providing additional anchorage, since the shrinkage<br>
which occurs when the plastic housing cools down after the<br>
injection process means that the load connections are often not<br>
firmly anchored, at least not permanently. In this case, the<br>
connection between the circuit mount and the injection-molded<br>
load connections is made by bonding.<br>
In this context, DE 199 14 741 likewise proposes load<br>
connecting elements which are connected to the inner wall of<br>
the housing and have bonding surfaces at their lower end. In<br>
this case as well, the connection between the respective load<br>
connecting element and the circuit mount is made by bonding<br>
wires. The types of connection described above both require<br>
bonding in the housing. An appropriate free space must be<br>
provided for the bonding tool in the housing for this purpose,<br>
and this has a disadvantageous effect on the module size,<br>
particularly in the case of small modules, since this space<br>
must be taken into account. As mentioned, the circuit mounts<br>
are coated with copper, although, depending on the bonding<br>
wires that are used, surfaces (pads) which can be bonded and<br><br>
- 2a -<br>
are composed of aluminum, nickel, copper or gold are required<br>
at the bonding connecting points for the bonding process, for<br>
which purpose the copper of the circuit mount is generally<br>
highly suitable. In some cases,<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
the circuit mounts must, however, be provided with bonding<br>
pads. The load connecting elements themselves are in general<br>
produced in solid form from copper or brass and<br>
disadvantageously likewise require surfaces which can be<br>
bonded. Furthermore, depending on the current load, different<br>
bonding wire diameters are often required for DCB circuit<br>
connections between the components on the one hand and the<br>
circuit connection to the load connecting elements on the other<br>
hand. This involves an additional process step and cost<br>
disadvantages .<br>
DE 36 43 288 describes various load connecting techniques. On<br>
the one hand, a current connecting bolt is described which is<br>
fitted to the circuit mount and is connected via a cross member<br>
and two screw connections to a mount body on the housing rim. A<br>
further connection from the mount body to the exterior is made<br>
possible by a separate screwed conductor element. Elsewhere, DE<br>
36 43 288 describes a leaf spring element which is screwed on<br>
one side to a separate mount body, or a mount body which is<br>
integrated in the housing, and rests in a sprung manner on the<br>
circuit mount on the other side, making electrical contact. A<br>
further connection from the mount body located in the housing<br>
to the exterior is made possible by a separate conductor<br>
element, which is likewise screwed to the mount body. The large<br>
number of elements used and the need for multiple screw<br>
connections in these connecting techniques must have a<br>
disadvantageous effect on the production costs. Another<br>
embodiment discloses a leaf spring element which has a<br>
cylindrical attachment, for engaging in the housing cover, on<br>
one side. When the housing cover is fitted, a contact pressure<br>
is exerted on the circuit mount. This may have the disadvantage<br>
that the contact is made only when the housing cover is closed.<br>
Furthermore, handling problems can be expected because of the<br>
fitting of the housing cover. A further disadvantage of this<br>
solution is that the area required on the circuit mount is<br>
comparatively large, and that the leaf spring occupies a<br><br>
- 3a -<br>
comparatively large amount of space in the housing in this<br>
arrangement.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
The latter could lead to space problems, and therefore to<br>
disadvantages, particularly when further discrete components of<br>
a higher type are fitted. Solutions based on leaf springs may<br>
be problematic overall in the event of incorrect sizes being<br>
used, especially when subject to increased shock and vibration<br>
loads.<br>
One object of the invention is accordingly to specify a power<br>
semiconductor module which allows a simple, long-life, cost-<br>
effective and flexible load connecting technique. A further<br>
object is, in particular, not to transmit the forces and<br>
torques which act from the outside on the connections to the<br>
connections of the circuit mount.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved for a power<br>
semiconductor module of the type mentioned initially in that<br>
rigid, integral and essentially straight load-connecting<br>
elements are fitted on the metallized part of the metallized<br>
surface of the circuit mount, are electrically and mechanically<br>
firmly connected to the circuit mount and project essentially<br>
at right angles into the housing interior, with separate<br>
connecting terminal elements for making electrical contact<br>
being fitted to the free end of the load connecting elements.<br>
The load connecting elements are advantageously and easily<br>
fitted directly to the generally copper metallization on the<br>
circuit mount, where they are firmly and rigidly connected<br>
electrically and mechanically to the circuit mount. The load<br>
connecting element is essentially straight and projects<br>
virtually at right angles to the circuit mount into the housing<br>
interior. The load connecting elements are integral, and there<br>
is no need to connect a plurality of connection elements to a<br>
connection which then also has to be supplied outside the<br>
housing. The circuit mount can highly advantageously be<br>
completely fitted separately, electrically connected, and then<br>
introduced into the housing as a unit. The abovementioned<br><br>
- 4a -<br>
electrical and mechanically firm connection of the load<br>
connecting elements to the circuit mount<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
excludes bonding as a connection technique. There is<br>
advantageously therefore no need to plan for any free space for<br>
bonding tools in the housing, either, and the overall housing<br>
can if required be designed to be more compact. This therefore<br>
also means that there is no need for the widely required<br>
separate process step for bonding for the connection from the<br>
circuit mount to the load connecting element. In many<br>
applications, it is even possible to dispense entirely with<br>
bonding and therefore, possibly, with the complete bonding<br>
apparatus. There is then also no need for special bonding pads<br>
formed from coatings of aluminum, nickel, copper or gold on the<br>
circuit mount, and the load current element can be applied<br>
directly to the generally copper metallization of the circuit<br>
mount surface. Furthermore, in some applications, there is no<br>
need for protective layers (for example soft casting) of<br>
oxidation protection on the bonding connection points. A<br>
functional test covering the entire module can be carried out<br>
before installation in the housing. No further work is required<br>
on the circuit mount after introduction into the housing.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the load connecting element is in<br>
the form of a cylinder or tube and may have different base<br>
surface geometries. By way of example, circular, oval or<br>
polygonal base surface geometries are feasible, as well as<br>
others. Load current elements with one of the abovementioned<br>
base surface geometries may either be in the form of a solid<br>
cylinder or else may be tubular, that is to say they may be in<br>
the form of a hollow cylinder with any desired wall thickness.<br>
Furthermore, rod-like load current elements may be used with<br>
base surface geometries with different profiles (for example U-<br>
profiles, T-profiles). This highly advantageously allows the<br>
sizes of the load current elements to be matched to their<br>
specific requirements. Specific requirements such as these may<br>
result from mechanical requirements such as stiffness, life,<br>
contact area on the circuit mount, from electrical requirements<br>
such as the current carrying capability or conductivity, or<br><br>
- 5a -<br>
else from production-relevant requirements such as economic<br>
machining capability. A tubular load connecting element<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
is advantageous because of the known ,skin effect and	the<br>
displacement of the current distribution to the surface of	the<br>
conductor, particularly when high-frequency currents	are<br>
applied to the conductor.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the base surface of<br>
the load connecting element is fitted in a free-standing form<br>
to the circuit mount by means of different types of connection,<br>
such as soldering, adhesive bonding or welding.<br>
Soldered joints are often required in any case on the circuit<br>
mount, for example either because the semiconductor component<br>
is fitted in a wiring mount and not as a naked chip, or because<br>
the circuit mount is intended to hold other circuitry<br>
components for external circuitry. In this case, the load<br>
current elements can be soldered on in an automated form in the<br>
same process as the other soldering processes. There is<br>
therefore no need for any additional tools or machines. In this<br>
case, the size and/or base surface of the load current element<br>
must be chosen such that they are positioned in a stable and<br>
free form on the circuit mount after being fitted, without any<br>
further holding apparatus, and cannot be tilted or rotated by<br>
the solder contact during transportation. In this case, the<br>
contact means may be fitted using any known process<br>
(dispensing, mask pressure, etc.). The load connecting elements<br>
are suitable for automatic placement as a poured item or goods<br>
in the form of strips, using existing chip placement systems.<br>
If a tubular load connecting element is used, then the solder<br>
can advantageously be arranged, depending on the shape of the<br>
load connecting element, such that the liquefied solder centers<br>
the tubular load connecting element, by the capillary and<br>
wetting force, on reaching the soldering temperature and the<br>
solder is distributed correctly onto the inner and outer casing<br>
surface of the body. The positioning accuracy is achieved by<br>
uniform distribution of the solder in all directions, and<br>
further positioning tolerances can be taken into account in the<br>
design via the housing or the circuit mount.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, that end<br>
of the load connecting element which is not soldered- and is<br>
free projects with an overhang through the housing outwards,<br>
where it is intended to hold a connecting terminal element for<br>
making electrical contact. An appropriate cutout can be<br>
provided for this purpose in the housing, and is preferably of<br>
the same shape as the free end of the load connecting element.<br>
It is advantageous to incorporate these cutouts in the housing<br>
cover, for easy handling capability. When the cover is fitted,<br>
this advantageously results in further retention for the load<br>
connecting element, and it can now not be separated from the<br>
circuit mount.<br>
In a further embodiment, the load connecting element is formed<br>
from a ceramic body with electrically conductively metallized<br>
casing surfaces. The outer and inner casing surfaces (in the<br>
case of a tubular load connecting element) will preferably have<br>
copper metallization. This means that there is no need for<br>
solid load connecting elements composed of copper or brass.<br>
Since, in general, the circuit mount is likewise composed of<br>
ceramic, this makes it possible to avoid mechanical stresses<br>
resulting from different coefficients of expansion, and this in<br>
turn has an advantageous effect on the life of the power<br>
semiconductor module.<br>
In a further variant, the metallized casing surface is highly<br>
resistant to wear, particularly in the section where the<br>
connecting terminal elements are fitted. In particular, it has<br>
been found advantageous to use a palladium coating. Good wear<br>
resistance in this section is particularly advantageous when<br>
the connecting terminal element is fitted and removed<br>
repeatedly.<br>
In a further particularly advantageous variant, the connecting<br>
terminal element has a cutout (inter alia a blind hole, hole,<br>
aperture) whose geometry and size correspond approximately to<br><br>
-la-<br>
the base surface geometry and size of the free end of the<br>
corresponding load connecting element to be<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
connected. The cutout in the connecting terminal element is<br>
placed over the free end of the projecting load connecting<br>
element. In this case, the size and shape of the cutout can<br>
advantageously be chosen so as to create a force-fitting<br>
connection between the connecting terminal element and the load<br>
connecting element which adheres well because of the friction<br>
forces and offers a good electrical contact between the two<br>
elements. This allows the connecting terminal elements to be<br>
fitted after complete assembly of the housing. There is no need<br>
for screw connection of the connecting terminal and load<br>
connecting element.<br>
In a further refinement, in the holding area for the load<br>
connecting element, the connecting terminal element has means<br>
which allow slight springing-back enlargement of the internal<br>
diameter of the cutout for fitting to the load connecting<br>
element, with the forces which occur in the widened area as a<br>
result of the springing-back characteristic increasing the<br>
force fit of the connection between the connecting terminal<br>
element and the load connecting element. If the cutout is a<br>
hole and if the hole is open on its circumference by a slot,<br>
this results, for example because of the material structure, in<br>
a whole opening which can be widened slightly and, when in the<br>
widened state, can be plugged over the overhang, which is in<br>
the form of a pin, of the load connecting element. The<br>
springing-back characteristic of the material structure will<br>
result in improved adhesion and contact with the load<br>
connecting element. This allows the connecting terminal element<br>
to be connected to the load connecting element without a large<br>
amount of force being applied in the direction of the circuit<br>
mount surface. In this case, the abovementioned embodiments<br>
represent only examples, and further variants are feasible<br>
which make use of the abovementioned fundamental principle.<br>
In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the housing and<br>
the connecting terminal element are designed such that the<br><br>
- 8a -<br>
connecting terminal element can be connected to the housing<br>
with an interlock and/or<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
with a force fit in order to absorb force and torque from<br>
externally introduced forces, such that the forces which are<br>
introduced are essentially transmitted to the housing. By, way<br>
of example, screw connections or adhesively bonded connections<br>
can be provided between the housing and the connecting terminal<br>
element in order to produce an interlocking connection. In<br>
another variant, the connecting terminal elements may even be<br>
injection molded in the housing cover. In another force-fitting<br>
connection, for example, walls are fitted to the housing, with<br>
a connecting terminal element being pushed with an accurate fit<br>
between such walls and therefore preventing rotation on the<br>
plane of the housing surface. Other connection variants<br>
include, for example, slots, grooves, tabs in the housing,<br>
depressions in the housing into which the terminal connecting<br>
element can be pressed, pushed or clicked. Furthermore,<br>
interlocking and force-fitting connection variants can be<br>
combined as required, and are governed by the installation<br>
conditions. Externally introduced forces and torques can<br>
therefore advantageously be transmitted to the housing.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the connecting terminal<br>
element has means which ensure a torsionally soft connection<br>
between the outer rail sections of the connecting terminal<br>
element. By way of example, means such as these may be material<br>
cutouts preferably in the area of the central rail section<br>
which, when a torsional force to the left or the right occurs<br>
on the external connection, lead to slight rotational<br>
deflection in this section, and therefore absorb a portion of<br>
the force that has been introduced. The deflection is cancelled<br>
out by the springing-back characteristic of the material as<br>
soon as the external torsional force is no longer applied. The<br>
maximum torsional force which can be introduced to the<br>
connecting terminal element can advantageously be governed by<br>
the maximum rotational deflection, and may correspond to this.<br>
In this case, the maximum torsional force which can be<br>
introduced is indicated by the maximum rotational deflection.<br><br>
- 9a -<br>
A connection can furthermore advantageously be formed between<br>
the housing and the connecting terminal element, and is<br>
detachable again. This<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
allows various connecting terminal elements to be installed and<br>
therefore to be flexibly adapted to the connecting technique,<br>
connecting areas and position of the connections in the<br>
structure.<br>
In one particularly advantageous embodiment, on its external<br>
conductor connecting side, the connecting terminal element has<br>
a holding device in the form of various, differently configured<br>
holes and/or contours, which allow flexible connection of<br>
normal external connections, using various connecting<br>
techniques. In this case, there is no need to replace<br>
connecting terminal elements, thus ensuring the maximum<br>
possible flexibility. For example, contours such as these may<br>
at the same time be connecting surfaces rotated through 90°,<br>
with a hole or screw connections. Furthermore, for example,<br>
contours are possible which ensure that external connecting<br>
conductors are clamped in after being inserted (pinch<br>
connection).<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be explained in<br>

with a connecting terminal element as shown in Figure<br>

Mutually corresponding parts are provided with the same<br>
reference symbols in all the figures.<br>
The power semiconductor module 1, which is illustrated<br>
schematically in the form of a cross section in Figure 1 and in<br>
the form of a plan view in Figure 2, comprises a housing body 2<br>
which is closed with a housing cover 3 and thus forms a housing<br>
interior 4 . The housing body 2 and the housing cover 3 can be<br>
screwed to one another, can be plugged together or can be<br>
connected to one another in any other desired manner. A flat<br>
circuit mount 5 is located in the interior of the housing<br>
formed by the housing body 2 and the housing cover 3. The<br>
circuit mount 5 is provided on at least one of its two surfaces<br>
6 with a metallized contact surface 7 (preferably copper) which<br>
is structured in accordance with the circuitry requirements<br>
(for example conductor tracks). The circuit mount 5 may be<br>
either a ceramic circuit mount, such as a DCB circuit mount, or<br>
else a printed circuit board composed of plastic. Electronic<br>
components 8 are mechanically and electrically connected to the<br>
circuit mount 5. The electrical connection between the<br>
electronic component 8 and the circuit mount 5 can be produced<br>
by soldering. If the electronic component is a naked chip which<br>
can be fitted to a DCB circuit mount, the connections between<br>
the chip and the circuit mount 5 are made by bonding. Those<br>
connections of the power semiconductor module which lead to the<br>
exterior and are in general the load connections are connected<br>
via the circuitry structure of the circuit mount 5 at a<br>
suitable point on the surface 6 of the circuit mount 5. The<br>
load connecting elements 9 are mechanically and electrically<br>
connected, preferably by soldering, to the circuit mount 5 at<br>
this point. The load connecting element 9 is in this case<br>
preferably at right angles to the circuit mount 5, and projects<br>
through the housing interior 4 in the direction of the housing<br>
cover 3.<br><br>

hexagonal base surface geometry, and Figure 4 shows a load<br>
connecting element 9 in the form of a circular cylinder. The<br>
two load connecting elements shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are<br>
in the form of hollow bodies, by way of example. Solid bodies<br>
and any other desired base surface geometries are feasible and<br>
may be worthwhile (current carrying capability, resistance to<br>
soldering). If the load connecting elements 9 advantageously<br>
comprise a ceramic body and are not composed of a solid<br>
conductive material, they have a metallized outer and/or inner<br>
casing surface 11.<br>
Figure 5 shows a plan view of a power semiconductor module 1<br>
without the housing cover 3 fitted but with connecting terminal<br>
elements 12 fitted for holding the external connection 14. The<br>
connecting terminal element 12 is placed over the load<br>
connecting element 9 and in one simple case comprises a cuboid<br>
rail piece with a plurality of bends or angles. Angles result<br>
in a first rail section 16, which runs virtually at right<br>
angles to the load connecting element in the installed state, a<br>
rail section 17 running approximately at right angles to this,<br>
and a rail section 18 which once again runs, in its extension,<br>
virtually parallel to the rail section 16. In order to hold the<br>
load connecting element, the connecting terminal element 12 has<br>
a cutout 13 in the area of the first rail section 16, which<br>
cutout 13 corresponds to the base surface geometry of the load<br>
connecting element 9 and allows a force-fitting connection,<br>
which makes an electrically reliable contact, between the load<br>
connecting element 9 and the connecting terminal element 12.<br>
The connecting terminal element 12 is composed of an<br>
electrically conductive material, or its surface is at least<br>
metallized with an electrically conductive material. In the<br>
simplest case and in the case of circular-cylindrical load<br>
connecting elements 9, the cutout 13 may be an aperture or<br>
blind hole. The rail section 18 has a holding device 19 which<br><br>
- 12a -<br>
holds the external connection 14. In the present case, a hole<br>
with an internal thread in it is provided as the holder<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
device 19, by means of which the external connection 14 is<br>
screwed on. Any other desired contours of the holding devices<br>
19 are feasible. Holding means 15 are provided on the housing<br>
and on the connecting terminal element 12 and ensure that the<br>
connecting terminal element 12 is fixed in order to absorb<br>
forces and torques introduced from the external connection 14.<br>
In Figure 5, the holding means 15 is a screw connection<br>
arranged in the first rail section 16 between the connecting<br>
terminal element 12 and the housing body 2. Further holding<br>
means are illustrated in Figures 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of the connecting terminal<br>
element 12, which can likewise be split into rail sections 16,<br>
17, 18. In this variant, a seat 20 in the form of a hollow<br>
cylinder is introduced into the cutout 13 in the connecting<br>
terminal element 12 in the first rail section 16 and ensures<br>
that an optimum contact is made with the circular load<br>
connecting element 9 in this exemplary embodiment. This seat 20<br>
has a slot 21 on at least one side of its cylindrical wall.<br>
This slot 21 ensures that the circular opening of the seat 20<br>
can be widened slightly in a manner which allows it to spring<br>
back, with the springing-back effect in the installed state<br>
resulting in better contact pressure between the seat 20 and<br>
the load connecting element 9. In the rail section 18, there is<br>
once again a holding device 19 comprising a screw 22 and a hole<br>
with an internal thread 23 for holding the external connection<br>
14, with the holding device 19 in this case having been widened<br>
by a quadrilateral plate 24 which allows force-fitting<br>
compression of the external connection 14. Two cutouts 28 in<br>
the form of elongated holes are provided in the rail section<br>
17. When torsional forces are introduced on the external<br>
connection, this section is subject to rotation deflection in<br>
the directions illustrated by the double-headed direction arrow<br>
29.<br><br>
- 13a -<br>
Figure 7 shows a plan view of a power semiconductor module 1<br>
with a housing. A connecting terminal element 12, explained in<br>
more detail in Figure 6, is placed on a load connecting<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
element 9. In order to support and fix the connecting terminal<br>
element 12 that has been fitted, the housing body 2 has a<br>
specifically shaped match 25 and walls 26 for each connecting<br>
terminal element, and these represent one refinement of the<br>
abovementioned holding means 15. The match 25 is a reinforced<br>
area in the material of the housing body 2, creating a contact<br>
or resting surface for the connecting terminal element 12 in<br>
the area of its rail sections 17 and 18. Furthermore, the match<br>
25 has a blind hole 27 which allows the screw 22 that has been<br>
tightened to be countersunk in it, at the same time absorbing<br>
compression and tension from the external connection 14, which<br>
is not illustrated here. The blind hole 27 may also have an<br>
internal thread which is at the same time responsible for<br>
holding the external connection 14 and the connecting terminal<br>
element itself. The walls 26 are vertical plate-like raised<br>
material areas which are integrally formed on the housing, in<br>
general, during plastic injection molding in the same process<br>
and are arranged at a distance from one another such that one<br>
connecting terminal element can be inserted with an accurate<br>
fit between two walls 26 in each case, essentially in the area<br>
of the rail sections 17 and 18. The walls 26 therefore fix the<br>
connecting terminal element 12 against lateral pressure, which<br>
can originate from the external connection 14. Furthermore, the<br>
walls 26 prevent rotation of the plate 24 and carry out<br>
isolation functions between adjacent connection terminal<br>
elements 12 .<br>
Based on Figure 6 and Figure 7, Figure 8 shows a plan view of a<br>
power semiconductor module with a connecting terminal element<br>
fitted with the housing cover, with the load connecting element<br>
9 in this case having a length such that it results in a<br>
projection 10 when the housing cover 3 is fitted, resulting in<br>
the load connecting element 9 extending beyond the fitted<br>
housing cover 3. The projections 10 on the three illustrated<br>
load connecting elements 9 pass through the fitted housing<br>
cover 3. For this purpose, the housing cover 3 has apertures,<br><br>
- 14a -<br>
which geometrically correspond to the base surface contour of<br>
the load connecting element 9 and by means of which the load<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
connecting elements 9 are additionally fixed once the housing<br>
cover 3 has been fitted, such that it is no longer possible for<br>
the load connecting element 9 to break off after assembly of<br>
the housing. In order to support and fix the fitted connecting<br>
terminal element 12, the housing cover 3 in this case has the<br>
specific holding means 15, as described above, for each<br>
connecting terminal element 12, in the form of an integrally<br>
formed match 25 and the walls 26, creating a contact or rest<br>
surface for the connecting terminal element 12 in the area of<br>
its rail sections 17 and 18.<br><br>
