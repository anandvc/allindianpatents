1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION: "PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF NITROPYRIDINE DERIVATIVES"<br>
2. APPLICANT:<br>
(a) NAME: INDOCO REMEDIES LIMITED<br><br><br><br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: Indoco House, 166 C. S. T. Road, Santacruz (East), Mumbai - 400 098, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides process for the preparation of nitropyridine derivatives of Formula I and its salt and its precursors such as halogenated amino pyridines;<br><br>
Wherein;<br>
Ri is selected from amino group, hydroxyl group, acyl group, alkyl amino group, halogen atom,-NH-C(0)-R3;<br>
Where R3 is branched or linear alkyl group having 1 - 6 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl group having 3-6 carbon atoms; R2 is selected from hydroxyl group, halogen atom, alkoxy group,<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Nitropyridine compounds are important intermediates for the preparation of substituted pyridine intermediates useful in the synthesis of adenosine compounds and analogs thereof which are useful in treating hypertension and myocardial ischemia. Further, nitropyridine are also useful in the preparation of the compounds those have been found to possess a high degree of anti - inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Such compounds are therefore valuable in the treatment of arthritic and dermatological disorder or like conditions responsive to anti - inflammatory drugs.<br>
Some of the nitropyridine compounds and precursors covered in the present invention represented by general formula - I are<br>
2<br><br><br>
Wherein;<br>
Ri is selected from amino group, hydroxyl group, acyl group, alkyl amino group, halogen atom, -NH-C(0)-R3;<br>
Where R3 is branched or linear alkyl group having 1 - 6 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl group having 3-6 carbon atoms: R2 is selected from hydroxyl group, halogen atom, and alkoxy group.<br>
Several methods for preparing nitropyridine derivatives, and its precursor, halogenated amino pyridine have been described viz. R. Graf, Ber., 1931, vol. 64, 21 - 27; J. Lombardino, J. Med. Chem., 1961, vol. 24, 39 - 42; H. S. Mosher et al., J. Org. Chem, 1955, vol. 20(3), 283 - 286; and E. Malsumura et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 1970, vol. 43, 3210 - 3214. In one of the prior art method, the precursor 4- chloro 2- amino pyridine is prepared from picolinic acid hydrochloride which is first reacted with thionyl chloride and subsequently with water results in 4 - chloro - picolinic acid which is converted to 2 - amino - 4 - chloro pyridine.<br>
In yet another method disclosed in H. S. Mosher et al., J. Org. Chem., 1955, vol. 20(3), 283 - 286; picolinic acid hydrochloride is first reacted with thionyl chloride and sulfer dioxide gas and subsequently with methanol to yield the ester, methyl 4 -chloropicoiinate. The ester was then reacted with hydrazine, sodium nitrite and acetic acid in water to yield 2 - amino - 4 - chloro pyridine along with the impurity of the dipyridine by product.<br>
In the literature procedure disclosed by DenHertog in Reel. Trav. Chim. Des Pays - Bas, 1946, 65, 129 - 140, the nitropyridine derivative is synthesized starting with diethyl 3 -oxopentanedioate which is treated with triethylorthoformate and acetic anhydride followed by treatment with cone, ammonia solution to yield 2, 4 - dihydroxy - 5 -carbethoxypyridine. The hydroxyl compound undergoes nitration as per the process<br>
3<br><br>
disclosed by Kogl, F., et al, in Reel. Trav. Chim. Des Pays - Bas, 1948, 67, 29 - 44 ; in presence of nitric acid and acetic acid results in 2, 4 - dihydroxy - 3 - nitro - 5 -carbethoxypyridine. The nitro compound formed is then subjected to hydrolysis followed by decarboxylation results in the formation of 2, 4 - dihydroxy - 3 - nitropyridine.<br>
In yet another prior art US6307054 the improvised process reveals the nitration with simultaneous insitu decarboxylation of the carbethoxy group by using phosphoric acid and nitric acid to get 2,4- dihydroxy - 3 - nitropyridine.<br>
The US application US20030225131AI describes the process for the preparation of compound 2 - Chloro - 3 - nitropyridine - 4 - ol, wherein 2, 4 - dihydroxy - 3 -nitropyridine is reacted with phosphorous oxychloride in presence of phase transfer catalyst benzyltriethyl ammonium chloride and solvent acetonitrile to get 2, 4 - dichloro -3 - nitropyridine which is isolated and reacted with cesium acetate in N, N -dimethyformamide (DMF) at 80Â°C. After the work up the compound 2 - Chloro - 3 -nitropyridine - 4 - ol is isolated. The major drawbacks of the prior art processes include:<br>
1.	The formation of dipyridine impurity during preparation of precursor 2 -.amino -4-chloro pyridine;<br>
2.	use of sulfur di oxide gas for the preparation of the ester compound of the precursor which is hazardous and not industrially useful;<br>
3.	Use of costly reagents and solvents such as triethylorthoformate, acetonitrile, phase transfer catalyst for the preparation of 2, 4 - dichloro compound;<br>
4.	use of cesium acetate which is hygroscopic, unstable and costly which prevents it's use on industrial scale;<br>
5.	Lengthy   process   involving   number   of  steps   to   prepare   the   nitropyridine compound.<br>
It is evident from the prior art that there remains a need for an improved process to prepare precursor of the nitropyridine and derivatives, devoid of impurities involving less number of steps and cost effective and industrially useful.<br>
4<br><br>
The present invention provides a novel process for the preparation of nitropyridine precursor and derivatives which involves stable and cpst effective reagents, less number of steps and therefore industrially useful.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to prepare precursor 4 - chloro - 2 - amino pyridine with an industrial friendly process.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide process for the preparation of substituted nitropyridine derivatives useful in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds;<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare nitropyridine derivatives of high purity and devoid of impurity.<br>

To this add the above Cyclopropane carbonyl chloride solution maintaining temperature at -15 to -5Â°C in one lot and stir at this temp for half an hour. Further added triethyl amine (13 ml) dissolved in dichloro methane (25 ml) to the reaction solution and continued stirring for 30 minutes at -15 to -5Â°C. Raised the temperature gradually to 0Â°c and then to 25 - 35Â°C and maintained for 2 to 3 hour. After the completion of reaction charged water (100 ml) and stirred for 15 minutes. Separated the organic layer and washed with water (100 ml). Dried the organic layer over anhydrous sodium sulphate and distilled out solvent under reduced pressure to get residual solid mass. To this solid, ethyl acetate (15 ml) was added and stirred for 30 minutes at 25 - 35Â°C. Cooled the reaction gradually to 0 to 5Â°C. The solid was then filtered and dried to yield pure N - (4 - chloro - 3 - nitropyridine - 2 - yl) cyclopropane carboxamide.<br>
