wastewaters<br>
Field of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a bacterial strain of accession No MTCC 5097 useful for<br>
reducing the Total dissolved solids (TDS) levels from both raw as well as electrofloated<br>
tannery effluents, a process of preparing inoculum of the strain for reducing the Total<br>
dissolved solids (TDS) levels from both raw as well as electrofloated tannery effluents<br>
and an aerobic method of reducing Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) from Tannery effluents<br>
using the said strain.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
The fact that the discharge of wastewaters containing hazardous compounds into natural<br>
environments, contributes heavily to the accumulation of bioaccumulative and<br>
recalcitrant pollutants, is well known. The tanning industry is designated as "Red<br>
Industry" due to the high pollution contributed by its solid and liquid wastes. It generates<br>
wastes that frequently accumulate in the environment despite controlled efforts.<br>
Therefore, our environment is under increasing pressure from solid and liquid wastes<br>
emanating from the leather industry.<br>
Leather processing and manufacturing involves a variety of aggressive chemicals and<br>
also consumes large quantity of water of which about 90% is discharged as wastewater.<br>
Tannery wastewater is a complex mixture of biogenic matter of the hides and a large<br>
variety of organic and inorganic chemicals added during the tanning process. Chemicals<br>
such as sulfides, sulphates, acids, alkalis, spent halogenated and non-halogenated organic<br>
solvents and chromium are used to process and manufacture leather. All these<br>
compounds appear in some form or the other in the discharges, resulting in an overall<br>
increase in the Total Dissolved solids (TDS) content of the effluent, which consists of<br>
both organic as well as inorganic components (M. Bosnic et al, 2000). Pollutants in<br>
tannery wastewater also include putrescible organic matter, sulphides, salts and alkalies<br>
of Ca, Na, K, Cr, various phenolics, organic acids, aldehydes, amines, preservatives, etc.<br>
(Kadam, 1990; Ramanujam, R.A., 1995) which also contribute to the TDS levels of the<br>
effluent. A number of such inorganic ions and organic compounds are biologically<br>
utilizable. However, some of these remain unreactive and contribute to the overall<br>
toxicity load.<br>
The use of sodium chloride during the process of raw material preservation is a major<br>
contributor to high TDS levels in tannery wastewaters. Most of the high quality raw hides<br>
and skins are preserved through a salting process using between 30 to 50% of common<br>
salt compared to the weight of raw hide/skin. This is the most commonly used<br>
preservation process because:<br>
Preservation by drying is limited to warm countries, where salt and energy<br>
sources are expensive.<br>
- Fresh processing of hides and skins, need a source of raw materials, constant in<br>
quality and quantity.<br>
- Preservation by chilling hides or skins is feasible only in countries where energy<br>
is cheap and where slaughtering facilities are already equipped with appropriate<br>
cooling facilities.<br>
- Other preservative chemicals are suitable for short-term preservation, but not<br>
suited for the long-term preservation.<br>
Apart from preservation, some sodium chloride is also necessary for pickling procedures<br>
before tanning. The other processing units of tanneries, viz., soaking, liming-deliming,<br>
bating and degreasing also contribute to the total TDS load as each unit discharges<br>
effluent containing inorganic components like sulphates, sulphides, carbonates,<br>
bicarbonates and calcium. Some of the organic components Ike peptide fractions, tannins<br>
and phenolics are also emanated.<br>
The organic load of tannery wastewater and of the treated effluents is usually<br>
characterized by its Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) &amp; Biochemical Oxygen Demand<br>
(BOD). To date, more detailed investigations of the organic load of tannery wastewater<br>
and its treatment are still missing (Rudolf, 1997). However, an important parameter like<br>
TDS is more often than not neglected. This is primarily due to the lack of availability of<br>
viable technologies for the reduction of this component of pollution. The TDS<br>
concentrations in a tannery effluent can reach up to 7,000 mgl"1, which is a matter of<br>
concern because of various problems that high TDS loadings can cause.<br>
Total dissolved solids (TDS) tell us the amount of both organic and inorganic dissolved<br>
compounds which may in many cases, remain persistent and result in a cumulative toxic<br>
effect (Genschow et al, 1996). The major components of inorganic dissolved solids<br>
includes the ions of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonates, sulphates,<br>
chlorides etc. Dissolved inorganic solids are important to the internal balance in certain<br>
aquatic organisms. Changes in the amounts of dissolved solids can be harmful because of<br>
the density of TDS determines the flow of water in and out of an aquatic organism's<br>
cells. High concentration of TDS may reduce the water clarity leading to a decrease in<br>
photosynthesis and when added with toxic compounds and heavy metals, leads to<br>
increase in temperature. This can often be harmful to many aquatic forms.<br>
TDS not only alters the quality of water, but also contributes to pollution. An amount of<br>
2100mg/l is the permissible limit of TDS in water as per EPA standards. However, this<br>
limit doesn't seem to be stringent enough considering that a TDS more than 1200 mg/1<br>
may be toxic to aquatic system as well as humans. EPA has set up an upper limit of<br>
500mg/l in case of drinking water. Hence, even though the permissible TDS levels in<br>
wastewaters are quite high, the above mentioned levels in water are allowed to be<br>
drained, due to the lack of availability of suitable methods for the reduction in TDS.<br>
Wastewater treatment eliminates most of the suspended solids, large quantities of<br>
dissolved organics and nitrogen having hardly any effect on TDS.<br>
Conventionally available TDS reducing technologies involve physicochemical treatment<br>
methods. Some of the methods are Reverse Osmosis (RO), Electrodialysis Reversal<br>
(EDR), freezing &amp; distillation and Ion exchange.<br>
A) Reverse Osmosis (RO) process: RO process is a membrane separation<br>
process in which feed waters flow along the membrane surface under<br>
pressure. Purified water permeates the membrane and is collected, while<br>
the concentrated water, containing dissolved and undissolved material that<br>
does not flow through the membrane, is discharged to the drain or dumped<br>
on the ground surface, thus contaminating the ground water as well. This<br>
technology involves high cost of operation and maintenance and is<br>
presently used only to remove TDS from drinking water.<br>
B) Electrodialysis Reversal (EDR): This process uses semipermeable<br>
membrane in which ions migrate through the membrane from a less<br>
concentrated to a more concentrated solution as a result of ionic attraction<br>
to direct electric current. This process is not suitable for high levels of<br>
certain metals ions and is limited in application to water with a TDS of<br>
less than 3000 mg/1, besides requiring a high energy input. The problem of<br>
disposal of the accumulated solids is also a negating factor for their<br>
application to industrial wastewaters.<br>
C) Freezing &amp; distillation: can be used for higher concentrations of TDS, as<br>
found in sea or brackish water (greater than 3000 mg/1)<br>
D) Ion Exchange: This technology is based on selective ionic exchange<br>
between different ion exchange matrices. However, its use is limited to<br>
lower TDS concentrations<br>
Thus, biological treatment methods are of utmost importance, as they work without<br>
adversely affecting the environment as in the case of physicochemical treatment<br>
processes (Bajpai et. al, 1994), which are also an economic burden on the industry<br>
because of the expensive infrastructure and maintenance required for their<br>
implementation. Besides, the problem of accumulation of such components in some other<br>
form, at some other site is another crucial drawback which can be overcome by using<br>
biological treatment methods.<br>
The best possible approach towards solving the aforesaid problem, therefore, is to devise<br>
biological methods for the reduction of TDS levels.<br>
Since tannery industry utilizes a huge amount of water and contains a considerable<br>
amount of total dissolved solids thereby rendering the water resistant to degradation, the<br>
need of the hour is to have selected and adapted microorganisms for reduction of TDS<br>
from tannery wastewaters (Kapoor et al, 1998, Kumar et al, 1998). The inventors have<br>
therefore, emphasized a need to isolate bacteria from natural environment, capable of<br>
reducing the level of TDS in wastewaters. Initially, consortia of bacteria were studied but<br>
later it was observed that a single bacterium is also equally capable of the same.<br>
Objects of the Present Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to isolate a bacterial strain for reducing the<br>
Total dissolved solids (TDS) levels from both raw as well as electrofloated tannery<br>
effluents.<br>
Another main object of the present invention is to isolate a bacteria for reducing the Total<br>

Yet another object of the present invention is to develop an aerobic method of reducing<br>
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) from Tannery effluents using the bacterial strain B5<br>
(accession no. 5097).<br>
Still another object of the present invention is identify the ratio of effluent to biomass for<br>
best results in reducing TDS.<br>

The strain of the instant Application is deposited in an International Depository. The<br>
Accession No. is MTCC 5097. The depository in the instant Application is called<br>
Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) at Chandigarh, INDIA. Recently, it is been<br>
granted thjs status of an International Depository under the Budapest Treaty. . rW'As described in the provisional patent, in the preliminary experiments the bacterial<br>
consortia were able to reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels of the tannery<br>
wastewaters by approximately 16%, over a period of fifteen days. However, later studies<br>
were performed to reduce the retention time of the same. This resulted in approximately<br>
11% reduction in the TDS levels of electro floated tannery effluent and approximately<br>
8.0% reduction in the raw effluent within a period of 48 hours by a single bacterial<br>
isolate, which is definitely better than the earlier disclosed 15-day retention period for the<br>
consortium. Therefore, in the complete patent specification, the results obtained by using<br>
the individual bacterial isolate have been presented; being markedly better than those<br>
obtained by the bacterial consortium.<br>

The present invention provides a novel, aerobic process for the reduction in the levels of<br>
TDS in tannery wastewaters and a modified method for the analysis of TDS. Also<br>
disclosed is an aerobic bacterial isolate, capable of significantly reducing the TDS load of<br>
electrofloated as well as raw tannery effluents.<br>
Present invention relates to a novel, aerobic biological process for the reduction of Total<br>
Dissolved Solids (TDS) from tannery wastewaters using a bacterial isolate and a<br>
modified method for the analysis of TDS.<br>
The bacterial isolate in the present invention is useful for reducing TDS levels in tannery<br>
wastewater.<br>
The bacterial isolate in the present invention has been isolated from the soil obtained<br>
from the dried dumped waste of a tannery wastewater treatment plant.<br>
5 gm of freshly sampled soil from the above said site is inoculated in the enrichment<br>
medium. Enrichment medium is prepared by adding 200 ml of soil extract withl.3 gm of<br>
Nutrient Broth and 67 \il of Candid B, autoclaved at 15 Ibs for 20 minutes at 121°C .<br>
Soil Extract is prepared from the solid waste collected from each site. 1 kg of the solid<br>
waste is dried at 50°C for 48 hrs until very little moisture remains, similar to garden soil.<br>
400 gm of the dried solid waste from each site is autoclaved with 960 ml single distilled<br>
water for 1 hr at 15 Ibs. After autoclaving, the sample is centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes at 5°C. The supernatant (extract) is collected and stored in sterile containers for<br>
preparation of medium for isolation.<br>
The enriched soil samples are serially diluted in Na2HPC&gt;4 - NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.8,<br>
0.05 M). 100 ul from each respective dilution is spread plated in duplicates on media<br>
plates with varying concentrations of soil extract and nutrient agar. The plates thus<br>
obtained are incubated at 37 + 2°C for 16- 24 hrs in an inverted position.<br>
The single isolated colony is picked and streaked on a fresh plate containing the same<br>
medium. The above step is repeated till pure colonies are obtained.<br>
The above mentioned bacterial isolate is inoculated with the help of sterile, nichrome<br>
loop into 15-20 ml sterile nutrient broth (NB) containing (per litre), 5.0 g peptic digest of<br>
animal tissue, 5.0 g of sodium chloride, 1.5 g of beef extract, 1.5 g of yeast extract and<br>
0.2 ml Tween-80. The culture is incubated at 37°C for approximately 16-18 hours in an<br>
incubator shaker. For gentle shaking, the incubator shaker is maintained at an appropriate<br>
rpm, preferably 100 rpm. After sufficient growth is obtained, the broth was stored at 4°C<br>
till further use. 250 ml of sterile NB is inoculated with 250 ul of the above prepared<br>
starter culture. The flask is kept for incubation at 37°C/100 rpm for 16-18 hours till an<br>
optical density (650 nm) Of 1.0 is achieved.<br>
The cells are harvested by centrifuging at an appropriate rpm, preferably 6000 rpm for 20<br>
minutes. The resultant pellet is washed twice by dissolving in minimum quantity of<br>
phosphate buffer, 0.05 M, pH 6.8 and recentrifuged under the same rpm and time<br>
conditions. During centrifugation, the temperature is maintained at 4°C. The pellet thus<br>
obtained, is washed in minimum volume of respective effluent and recentrifuged to<br>
minimise any chances of the buffer salts entering into the sample thus reducing the<br>
chance of any increase in total dissolved salts by them. The pellets thus obtained are then<br>
resuspended in minimum volume of respective effluent, vortexed to make a<br>
homogeneous suspension and used for reducing TDS from the tannery.<br>
Both the raw as well as electrofloated effluents are treated for TDS reduction in the<br>
present invention. For setting up the TDS reduction experiments, 250 ml of sample is<br>
taken in screw-capped conical shake- flasks. The inoculum is added to the effluent<br>
samples after checking the pH of the effluents to be preferably around 7.0. Control flask,<br>
without any added inocula are also maintained for comparison. The flasks are incubated<br>
at 37°C/100 rpm for a period of 24 hours.<br>
For assessing the reduction in the TDS levels, a modification in the standard APHA<br>
method is carried out. Approximately 70 ml is withdrawn and processed for analysis. The<br>
samples withdrawn are centrifuged in dry and clean centrifuge tubes (rinsed with triple<br>
distilled water) at 7000 rpm for 20 minutes, preferably at 4°C. The supernatant is<br>
collected immediately in clean and dry containers pre-rinsed with triple distilled water.<br>
The supernatant is then filtered through 0.45 u membrane filters (Millipore). 25 ml of this<br>
is then measured with the help of a clean and pre-rinsed measuring cylinder and<br>
transferred to a cleaned, overnight-dried, desiccated and pre-weighed beaker. The<br>
measuring cylinder is rinsed again with 20 ml of triple distilled water and the same<br>
transferred to the beaker containing the sample. The same procedure is repeated for<br>
processing all the samples. The beakers are then dried in a hot air oven at 180+2°C. After<br>
drying, the beakers are transferred to a vacuum desiccator and cooled for approximately<br>
45 minutes to one hour to attain room temperature and weighed.<br>
TDS (mg/1) is calculated using the following formula:<br>
TDS (mg/l) = (A-B)/sample volume<br>
Where,<br>
Ar-= final weight of the beaker with dried filtrate<br>
B= initial weight of the beaker without sample<br>
The invention further provides a process for the preparation of inoculum of the said<br>
bacterial (MTCC 5097) isolate and using it for reduction of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)<br>
from both raw as well as electrofloated tannery effluents, which comprises:<br>
a) isolating a bacterial isolate from dumped waste soil collected from the effluent<br>
treatment plant of a tannery;<br>
b) culturing the said bacterial isolate on nutrient agar media containing to varying<br>
concentration of soil extract prepared from the collected soil to get pure cultures;<br>
c) inoculating the said bacterial isolate in nutrient broth containing 0.01% Tween 80<br>
to obtain starter culture;<br>
d) culturing the above bacterial isolate for obtaining required biomass by inoculating<br>
appropriate aliquot of nutrient broth, with the starter culture and incubating the<br>
above medium at 37°C/100 rpm for 16-18 hours;<br>
e) Centrifuging the resulting culture, after attaining an optical density of 1.0, to<br>
obtain pellet, washing the collected pellet by dissolving in PO/t"3 buffer, 0.05M,<br>
pH 6.8, recentrifuging the pellet;<br>
1) collecting the pellet obtained from step (e), washing by dissolving in 10 ml of<br>
respective effluents and recentrifuging to obtain cell pellet for treatability studies;<br>
g) Dissolving the above formed pellet in minimum volume of respective effluents<br>
and homogenized by vortexing to obtain cell slurry;<br>
h) inoculating appropriate aliquots of the tannery effluents with the cell slurries<br>
obtained in step (g) for IDS reduction studies along with control flasks containing<br>
effluent samples without any added inocula;<br>
i) incubating the flasks set up in step (h) at 37°C/100 rpm for 24 hours;<br>
j) Withdrawing samples from the above flasks in 70 ml aliquots and processing<br>
them for assessing IDS levels;<br>
k) Analysing IDS of the above samples using modified APHA method as described<br>
in (1);<br>
1) Centrifuging the above samples at 8000 rpm for 20 minutes and filtering the<br>
supernatant through 0.45u membrane filters (Millipore) and then using this filtrate<br>
for estimation of dry weight.<br>

wastewaters by approximately 16%, over a period of fifteen days. However, later studies<br>
were performed to reduce the retention time of the same. This resulted in approximately<br>
11% reduction in the TDS levels of electro floated tannery effluent and approximately<br>
8.0% reduction in the raw effluent within a period of 48 hours by a single bacterial<br>
isolate, which is definitely better than the earlier disclosed 15-day retention period for the<br>
consortium. Therefore, in the complete patent specification, the results obtained by using<br>
the individual bacterial isolate have been presented; being markedly better than those<br>
obtained by the bacterial consortium.<br>

The above-stated invention is substantiated with the help of few examples. These<br>
examples are merely for illustrations and should not be construed to limit the scope of the<br>
invention<br>
Example I<br>
Bacteria were isolated from both raw, as well as electrofloated wastewater from the<br>
Common Effluent Treatment Plant of a tannery. The pH of the effluent was checked and<br>
found to be 7.0 + 0.2 for raw effluent and 8.3 + 0.2 for electrofloated effluent, which was<br>
neutralized using IN HC1. The different media used for isolation were:<br>
Media A: Filtered and autoclaved wastewater with agar was used as media. Effluent<br>
agar plates were prepared using 2 % agar.<br>
Media B: Halophilic medium: The composition of the Halophilic media with different<br>
concentrations of NaCl viz., 1% , 2.5 %, 5% and 10% used was as follows:<br>
KC1 2g<br>
MgSO4.7H2O 20 g<br>
Tri- Na Citrate 3 g<br>
Yeast Extract (Oxoid) 10 g<br>
Casein Hydrolysate 7.5 g<br>
FeCl2.4H20 36 mg<br>
MnCl2.4H2O 0.36 mg<br>
pH 7.0 + 0.2<br>
Agar 2 %<br>
Serial dilution plating was carried out by serially diluting the enriched inocula till a<br>
dilution of 10-12. Serial dilution was carried out by taking 9 ml aliquots of Na2HPO4 -<br>
NaH2PC«4 buffer (pH 6.8, 0.05 M) and inoculating 1 ml of enriched inoculum in the first<br>
vial, vortexing and taking 1ml from this vial and diluting the next vial with it, till a 10"12<br>
dilution was obtained.<br>
100 ul from each dilution was spread plated, pour plated and loop full was streaked in<br>
triplicates on different agar media. The plates thus obtained were incubated at 37+2 °C for<br>
16-24 hrs in an inverted position.<br>
Colonies with distinct morphology were marked according, picked and streaked on to<br>
plates of respective media to obtain pure culture. The pure cultures were maintained on<br>
the respective slants and stabs, kept at 4 C for further used for experiments<br>
Fifteen morphologically different bacterial isolates were selected and starter cultures<br>
were prepared. Loopful of cultures were taken and inoculated in sterile aliquots of<br>
nutrient broth, vortexed and kept for incubation at 37 °C/120 rpm for 16-18 hrs. The<br>
optical density of these starter cultures were checked at 650 nm and kept at 4 °C till<br>
further use. Working cultures were prepared for screening their ability to reduce Total<br>
Dissolved Solids in electrofloated tannery wastewaters. 100 ml aliquots of sterile NB<br>
were inoculated with 100 ul of respective starter cultures and incubated at 37 C/120 rpm<br>
for 16-18 hours. The initial and final optical densities at 650 nm were noted. Cultures at<br>
an OD650 of 2.0 were taken in equal proportions according to the composition of the<br>
consortia and mixed together. The resultant bacterial suspensions were centrifuged at<br>
7000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C. The pellets obtained were washed twice using sterile<br>
phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4 - NaH2PO4 pH 6.8, 0.05 M) and resuspended in small<br>
volume of the same. This suspension was then used for treatability assay in a ratio of 1:1,<br>
i.e., 100 ml of effluent sample was treated with pellet obtained from 100 ml of culture<br>
media.<br>
The TDS reduction experiments were carried out in batch cultures samples of<br>
electrofloated effluent, in conical shake flasks at 37°C at 120 rpm for a period of fifteen<br>
days. Control flasks without any additional inoculum were also maintained and results<br>
compared with these samples. TDS was analysed over a period of fifteen days according<br>
to the standard procedure as mentioned in APHA. An increase in the TDS levels were<br>
observed on addition of biomass, which could be due to the passage of bacteria passing<br>
through GFC filter (pore size 1.2 u), thus contributing to the weight of the residue<br>
obtained (Table 1). Hence in all the future experiments a modification in the analysis<br>
method was carried out.<br>
Example II<br>
The bacterial consortia were prepared again and used for checking their efficiency in<br>
TDS reduction of electrofloated tannery effluent, using a modified version of the standard<br>
APHA method, as described further. The individual bacteria comprising the consortia<br>
were grown in appropriate aliquots of NB till an O.D.gso of 1.0. The preparation of the<br>
bacterial consortia was conducted in the same manner as described in example I. 100 ml<br>
aliquots were treated in a 1:1 ratio with the prepared consortia. Analysis of TDS levels<br>
over a period of fifteen days was carried out by the modified standard APHA method, as<br>
described below.<br>
The samples were withdrawn in appropriate aliquots and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for a<br>
period of 20 minutes. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.45 |u (Millipore) filter.<br>
The filtrate was then measured through a clean, pre-rinsed measuring cylinder and<br>
transferred to a clean, pre-weighed beaker. The beaker had been rinsed with triple<br>
distilled water, baked overnight at 180 C, desiccated at pre-weighed before transferring<br>
the sample. The beakers containing the sample were then placed at 180 C in a hot air<br>
oven for overnight drying. The beakers were then desiccated to cool to room temperature<br>
and weighed to calculate the weight of the residue. The same was then calculated to find<br>
the actual TDS value, expressed in mg/1 (Table 2). A maximum TDS reduction of over<br>
4% was recorded after a period of fifteen days in electrofloated samples.<br>
Example HI<br>
Since the TDS reduction was very less even after 15 days, so bacteria were isolated from<br>
the liming process washing water. Bacteria were isolated on nutrient agar plates by using<br>
the dilution plating method as described in example I. Isolates were stored as slants and<br>
stabs at 4 °C till further use.<br>
Three different consortia were formulated using these bacterial isolates in the same way<br>
as described in example I and screened for their efficiency to reduce IDS from<br>
electrofloated tannery effluent. Samples were analysed for TDS levels by the modified<br>
IDS analysis method as described in example II. A percentage reduction of 13-16% was<br>
observed after 15 days.<br>
Example IV<br>
Individual bacteria from the consortia, used in example III, were recombined to form<br>
different consortia as described previously and screened for their TDS reducing<br>
capability against both raw as well as electrofloated tannery effluents. The earlier<br>
consortia were showing a 13-16% TDS reduction after 15 days. So, in order to decrease<br>
the retention time and also see whether a better performance could be obtained by<br>
formulating new consortia.<br>
Experiments were set along with their controls in the same manner as described in<br>
example III and analysed over a period of five days. A percentage decrease of up to 8%<br>
was observed in the electrofloated samples (Table 4b) and up to 5.0% in the raw effluent<br>
(Table 4a).<br>
Example V<br>
The consortia giving more than 7.0% TDS reduction and more than 4.5% were selected<br>
and the constituent bacterial isolates, screened individually. The individual bacterial<br>
pellets were prepared according to the same procedure as described in example II.<br>
However, the washing of the cells was carried out by first washing them by phosphate<br>
buffer (0.05M, pH 6.8) and finally washing by suspending the phosphate buffer-washed<br>
pellet in 10 ml of respective effluents. The suspension was then centrifuged at 7000 rpm<br>
for 20 minutes and the cells obtained were resuspended in minimum quantity of the<br>
effluent to be used for inoculating appropriate aliquots of both raw as well as<br>
electrofloated tannery effluents.<br>
A percentage reduction of up to 9.0% by isolate ET7 in electrofloated samples (Table 5b)<br>
and up to 7.0% in raw effluent (Table 5a) was observed over a period of 5 days.<br>
Example VI<br>
In order to further improve the TDS reduction efficiency, it was decided to isolate<br>
bacteria from different samples taken from different sites of Tannery Effluent Treatment<br>
Plant. Solid waste from eight different sites, where the wastewater collected during the<br>
processing of hides to leather, were selected. The sites were as follows:<br>
Site A: Dumped waste (dumping site of the sludge and other waste of the waste-water<br>
treatment plant)<br>
Site B: Old Tank waste (site which was earlier being used for collecting wastewater from<br>
chrome-tanning, dyeing and liming wrash-water]<br>
Site C : Lime treatment waste [site where wastewater and solid waste collected after lime<br>
treatment of hide]<br>
Site D : Common waste [tank where solid waste and waste water from all the processing<br>
of hides collected, viz., from chrome tanning, dyeing and Lime treatment processes]<br>
Site E : Chrome waste [ site where wastewater collected after chrome tanning]<br>
Site F : Sludge (Effluent Treatment plant of the tannery)<br>
Site G : Dye Waste (tank where wastewater collected after dyeing of hides)<br>
Site H : Chrome and Dye Waste (tank where wastewater collected after chrome tanning<br>
and dyeing)<br>
Extract was prepared from the solid collected from each site. 1 kg of each solid waste<br>
was dried at 50 C for 48 hrs until very little moisture remained and a consistency similar<br>
to garden soil was achieved. 400 gm of each of the above dried, solid wastes were<br>
autoclaved with 960 ml single distilled water for 1 hr atJ15 psi. After autoclaving, the<br>
samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 minutes at 5 C. The supernatants (extracts)<br>
were collected and stored in sterile containers for preparation of different media.<br>
Enrichment media were prepared by adding 200 ml of the respective extracts from each<br>
site with 1.3 gm of Nutrient Broth and 67 ul of Candid B, autoclaved at 15 Ibs for 20<br>
minutes at 121 °C. 5 gms of fresh soil from the respective sites were added and the media<br>
incubated at 37 C at 120 rpm for 48 hrs.<br>
The enriched soil samples were serially diluted in Na2HPO4 - NaH2PC&gt;4 buffer (pH 6.8,<br>
0.05 M). 100 ul from each respective dilution were spread plated in duplicates on media<br>
plates with varying concentration of extract and Nutrient Broth from respective site<br>
(Medium A: Nutrient Agar, Medium B: Soil Extract (200 ml) + 1.3 gm Nutrient Broth<br>
with 2 % agar, Medium C: Soil Extract with 2 % Agar). The plates thus obtained were<br>
incubated at 37 + 2 C for 16- 24 hrs in an inverted position.<br>
Colonies with distinct morphologies were picked and streaked onto plates of respective<br>
media to obtain pure culture. The pure cultures were maintained on the respective slants<br>
and stabs and kept at 4 C for further use.<br>
136 bacterial cultures were obtained and consortia designed to screen them for their<br>
efficiency to reduce TDS from both electrofloated as well as raw tannery wastewater.<br>
The consortia were prepared in the same manner as described in the previous example<br>
and inoculated in 1:1 effluent : biomass ratio as described in example I. The samples<br>
were analysed by the modified TDS analysis method as described in example II over a<br>
period of 48 hours.<br>
A percentage reduction of up to 9.0% in electrofloated tannery effluent (Table 6b) and up<br>
to 7% in raw tannery effluent was observed within 48 hours (Table 6a) as compared to<br>
the similar reduction observed after 5-days as shown in example IV and V.<br>
Example VII<br>
It was hypothesised that bacteria growing in sites rich in chlorides, sulphates and nitrates,<br>
could be better degraders of TDS contributing components. Therefore, soil samples were<br>
collected from sites rich in the above salts and bacteria were isolated from the above<br>
samples using various culture media.<br>
Enrichment of the bacterial flora was carried out in the following culture media<br>
(composition per litre):<br>
MEDIUM A: The composition of medium A is as follows :<br>
Solution A<br>
Solution B<br>
Solution C<br>
980ml<br>
10 ml<br>
10ml<br>
Solution A (per 1000 ml of distilled water) comprised of KNO3 (5.0g), (NH4)2SO4<br>
(l.Og), K2HPO4.3H2O (0.87g), KH2PO4 (0.54g) and Glucose (4.0g). Solution B was<br>
prepared by adding 2g /100 ml of MgS04.7H2O and Solution C was prepared by<br>
dissolving the following salts, per 100 ml of 0.1 N HC1; viz. CaCl2.2H2O (0.2g),<br>
FeSO4.7H2O (O.lg), MnSO4.H2O (0.05g), CuSO4.5H2O (0.0Ig), Na2MoO4.2H2O (0.0Ig).<br>
All the above solutions were autoclaved at 121°C at 15 psi for 15 minutes and cooled to<br>
25 C. These were then mixed aseptically and used both for enrichment as well as<br>
isolation of bacteria.<br>
MEDIUM B : This medium was prepared using different NaCl percentages, i.e., 1.0,<br>
2.5,5.0,10.0 and 12.5. The other components were (per litre of distilled water);<br>
MgCl2.6H2O (50.0 g), K2SO4 (5.0 g), CaCl2.6H2O (0.2 g), tryptone (5.0 g) and yeast<br>
extract (5.0 g). The medium was autoclaved at 121 C at 15 psi for 15 minutes and cooled<br>
to 25 C and used for enrichment as well as isolation of bacteria.<br>
Medium C: Nutrient Broth medium containing (per litre of distilled water) 5.0 g peptic<br>
digest of animal tissue, 5.0 g of sodium chloride, 1.5 g of beef extract, 1.5 g of yeast<br>
extract and 0.2 ml Tween-80 was prepared, autoclaved and used for enrichment as well as<br>
isolation of bacteria.<br>
Enrichment was carried out at 37 C for a period of 7 days. The isolation was done as<br>
described earlier and pure cultures obtained were stored at 4 °C till further use.<br>
Isolated bacteria were grown individually and formulated into consortia as described<br>
earlier and used for screening their efficiency for TDS reduction against electrofloated as<br>
well as raw tannery effluents. TDS analysis was carried out according to the modified<br>
IDS analysis method as described in example II, over a period of 48 hours (Table 7a and<br>
7b). A reduction of up to 9.3% was observed in electrofloated effluent by consortium<br>
EDK2 and up to 5.5% in raw effluent, by consortia RDK3 and RDK5.<br>
Example VIII<br>
Individual bacteria constituting the best performing bacterial consortia in example VI,<br>
were screened for their capacity to reduce TDS from both raw as well as electrofloated<br>
tannery effluents. The bacterial pellets for inoculating the treatability experiments were<br>
formed in the same manner as explained in the previous examples. A ratio of 1:1 effluent<br>
: biomass ratio was maintained and the TDS levels were analysed over a period of 48<br>
hours using the modified TDS analysis method as described in example II.<br>
A percentage reduction of about 10.3% in electrofloated samples (Table 8b) by isolate<br>
Accession No. MTCC 5097 and up to 8.0% in raw effluent (Table 8a) by isolate of<br>
Accession No. 5097 was exhibited within a period of 48 hours.<br>
Example IX<br>
In order to find out which biomass loading would give the best results, the bacteria<br>
exhibiting more than 6.0% in raw tannery effluent and more than 9.0% in electrofloated<br>
effluent were re-tested against respective effluent samples with different effluent:<br>
biomass ratios viz. 1:0.5 and 1:1. The individual bacteria were cultured in the previously<br>
described manner and harvested at a final O.D.esoof 1.5.<br>
Appropriate sample aliquots were withdrawn at zero hour and 24 hrs for TDS analysis. It<br>
was found that the effluent: biomass ratio of 1:1 exhibited better results as compared to<br>
the ratio of 1:0.5. Also, increasing the O.D of the cultures to 1.5, exhibited a percentage<br>
reduction up to 11.1 in electrofloated and 8.1 in raw effluent, by the bacterial isolate of<br>
accession No. MTCC 5097.<br>
