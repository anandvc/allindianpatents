This invention relates to "An integrated end-mould system comprising combined AC flasher 86 regulator units".<br>
The well-known type of flasher unit, which is operatively connected to other related electrical systems in any automobile, is used for operating the turn signal lamps for blinking. It comprises a P.C. Board, transistor, silicon-controlled rectifier, diodes, electrical-resistors etc. for its known electrical functions.<br>
In addition, the known regulator employed in the automobile field is used for regulating the AC-output voltage from Magneto against any over voltage, which perhaps may occur. It comprises a PCB, transistor, silicon-controlled rectifier, diodes, electrical-resistors etc. for its known electrical functions.<br>
The known constructive features particularly for the existing AC-voltage system of two-wheeler motor vehicles for its lighting arrangements comprises the following as shown in FIGURES 01 A to 01 C: From Magneto M, the electrical power is supplied to the lighting arrangements, spark-plug(s) and the like. The later is related to the power generating units. A part of the power supply from said Magneto M, is supplied to input R2 of the regulator R and then to the various lamps, horns etc., fitted thereon through the output R3. Since the magneto voltage generated, is directly proportional to the rotational speed, the voltage of the magneto output is variable in nature due to the inherent variations of rotational speed of the magneto. This voltage-regulator R is employed to regulate the voltage to the various electrical appliances like headlamp HL and turn signal lamp TSL etc. to protect against any over-voltage and thereby causing any malfunction. In addition, the Flasher unit F is electrically connected between said Regulator R and Turn signal lamp TSL for its known function of electrically blinking i.e., periodical stopping and allowing of the electrical supply with a predetermined and constant cyclic operation. This is the known feature of the conventional system of separate regulator and flasher units.<br><br>
The separate system of regulator R and flasher F as shown in FIGURES 01 B and 01 C are employed in any automobile in which electrical power is supplied to various (all) electrical appliances from magneto unlike from the battery power source. The problem incurred in the above system is as follows: Since each of two-independent/separate end-mould pieces made up of an electrical insulator, appropriately comprises the said electronic components, each of that R and F requires separate mounting bracket(s) Rl and Fl through which they are connected to the said vehicle. Also the electrical connectors (wires) bridging R3 and F2, is considerably required with much long-length, which depends upon the distance between the flasher and regulator units as shown in FIGURES 01 B AND 01 C, The total size and weight of the two end-mouifed pieces R4 and F4 comprising the flasher and regulator units are further considerably high; thereby the cost is also significantly higher.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide an integrated end-mould system comprising combined AC flasher &amp; regulator units with cheaper in cost, lower in weight and minimum number of mounting features.<br>
Another object of this invention is to eliminate the bridging distance between the regulator and flasher units by integrating together.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide the compact system of combined regulator and flasher units, which is also easy to assemble and dismantle.<br>
The integrated end mould system according to this invention comprises combined AC flasher and regulator units electrically connected together, said end mouid system is provided with single mounting bracket for connecting to the vehicle or apart thereof, the printed circuit board (PCB) of both former and later parts are<br><br>
also integrated in the end mould system, the electrical connection between the<br>
said former and later parts is provided by the electrical bridge in a single and<br>
integrated printed circuit board for said both former and later parts moulded in<br>
the said end mould system, the said integrated printed-circuit-board is provided<br>
therein in such a way that it is capable of being made in a single process and<br>
wherein it is lesser weight and cost with minimum and sufficient number of<br>
mounting features, the assembly and dismantling of the said system requires only<br>
half of the efforts and time of the conventional systemThe invention will can be apparent from the following non-limitative description<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURE 01 A       shows aelectrical circuit diagram of aknown system of<br>
regulator and flasher units for a magneto system;<br>
FIGURE 01 B       shows a pictorial view^ of a known regulator unit with a<br>
separate mounting feature;<br>
FIGURE 01 C       shows a pictorial view of aknown flasher unit also with<br>
another separate mounting feature;<br>
FIGURE 02	shows a pictorial view of a preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention as an integrated end mould system comprising the regulator and flasher units;<br>
Referring to FIGURE 02, according to this invention, an integrated end mould system 5 made up of an electrically insulated material is provided with a regulator and a flasher unit integrally comprised therein. This is made by a single end-mould process. The electrical connection between the said regulator and the said flasher units is provided with an electrical bridge connected between   the printed circuit board of said regulator and flasher  units.   The said<br><br>
integral printed circuit board of both said regulator and flasher units provided integrally, comprises said electrical bridge connected between the printed circuit board of said regulator and flasher. The said regulator and flasher units with their integral printed circuit board are concealed in said end mould piece (system). The said end mould 5 is provided with a single mounting bracket 1, which is connected thereto 5 during moulding process itself. The purpose of this single mounting bracket 1 is to connect that to the vehicle or any part thereof. The said system is provided with an electrical-socket 2 as an electrical-input connector, another electrical-socket 3 as an electrical-output connector of said regulator and an electrical cable 4 as an electrical-output connector of said flasher unit. The said third connector 4 is also employed to connect the said system with turn signal lamps through the known electrical cables and the said second connector 3 is to connect the same with the horn, all other lighting systems, etc.<br>
According to this invention, since it is a single end mould piece, the weight and cost thereof is significantly lower as compared to the present system of similar functions and requirements. Also as the electrical-bridge between the said regulator and flasher units are provided integrally with the said concealment by the said end mould 5, the possibility of the failure-prone thereof is significantly minimised against any mechanical/weather cause. As the said system is provided with a single mounting bracket, the cost and both the efforts and time required for assembling and dismantling of the system respectively to and from the vehicle are minimised. Since, the part of the printed circuit board for both said regulator and flasher units are integral to each other, the length, cost and the prone to its failure of the said electrical-bridge are also significantly minimised.<br>
The terms and expressions used herein are illustrative and not limitative in any sense.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An integrated end-mould system comprising combined AC flasher and<br>
regulator units electrically connected together, said end mould system is<br>

parts are also integrated in the end mould system, the electrical<br>
connection between die said former and later parts is provided by the<br>
electrical bridge in a single and integrated printed circuit board for said<br>
both former and later parts moulded in the said end mould system, the<br>
said integrated printed-circuit-board is provided therein in such a way<br>
that it is capable of being made in a single process and wherein it is<br>
