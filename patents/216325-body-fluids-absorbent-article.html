				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a body fluids absorbent<br>
article and more particularly to such an article suitable to <br>
be used by women such as a sanitary napkin/pad or pad for<br>
incontinent women.<br>
Reference is made to copending Indian application nos. 394/Cal/l999 and 511/ Cal/1999.<br>
Taking account of the particular purpose for its use,<br>
this type article is desired, in general, to have a good<br>
characteristic for body fluids such as a high absorptive<br>
property as well as a high leakage-proof property. In<br>
addition, a comfortable characteristic for the wearer"s skin<br>
such as a soft touch as well as a breathability is desired<br>
because this type article is used in direct contact with the<br>
wearer"s skin. Obviously, this type article preferably has<br>
a combination of these two characteristics. However, it is<br>
not easy for the arrangement of prior art to achieve the<br>
article satisfying these two characteristics since these two<br>
characteristics are partially antinomic to each other. For<br>
example, in the case of sanitary napkin, the napkin must be<br>
tightly placed against the wearer"s skin in order to improve<br>
a leakage-proof effect for menstrual discharge. On the other<br>
hand, such tight placement causes the napkin to stick to the<br>
wearer"s skin due to menstrual discharge itself and/or sweat<br>
and, in consequence, the wearer may suffer from an<br>
uncomfortable feeling, e.g., a sticky and/or stuffy feeling.<br>
It is well known, for example, from Japanese Patent<br>
Application Disclosure Gazette (Kokai) No. Hei10-94558 to<br>
form the article of the type herein discussed on its body<br>
facing surface with a plurality of gathers extending on the<br>
central region longitudinally of the body facing surface<br>
leaving the lateral regions intact and to form the troughs<br>
forming parts of the gathers with a plurality of liquid-<br>
passages arranged at regular intervals in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the troughs. The invention disclosed in the<br>
foregoing document claims that the liquid-passages facilitate<br>
the body fluids discharged on the article to be quickly<br>
absorbed by the absorbent core and the gathers ensure a good<br>
feeling to wear the article by preventing the body facing<br>
surface of the article from sticking to the wearer"s skin.<br>
However, the lateral regions of the body facing surface<br>
are substantially smooth in the article of prior art and at<br>
least these lateral regions tend to stick to the wearer"s<br>
skin due to sweating of the wearer. This may result in an<br>
uncomfortable feeling to wear, e.g., a feeling of stickiness.<br>
Another important disadvantage lies in the plurality of<br>
gathers present in the central region of the body facing<br>
surface. These gathers form a plurality of air gaps which<br>
affect absorption of menstrual discharge and thereby cause<br>
leakage of menstrual discharge. Furthermore, a relatively<br>
high rigidity of the gathers is incompatible with delicate<br>
body region of the article wearer.<br>
In view of the problem as has been described above, it<br>
is an object of this invention to provide an absorbent<br>
article, particularly a sanitary napkin improved to have both<br>
characteristics which are antinomic as has been mentioned "<br>
above. More specifically to describe this, the central<br>
region of the body facing surface for which absorption of<br>
menstrual discharge is important rather than prevention of an<br>
undesirable feeling of stickiness inevitably caused as the<br>
body facing surface sticks to the wearer"s skin around her<br>
vaginal opening due to menstrual discharge and/or sweat pf<br>
herself should have a high absorptive property. On the other<br>
hand, the lateral regions of the body facing surface rather<br>
unimportant for absorption of menstrual discharge and having<br>
a relatively large area over which these regions are placed<br>
against the wearer"s skin are effective to prevent the<br>
article from sticking to the wearer"s skin due to sweating of<br>
the wearer.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a body<br>
fluids absorbent article comprising an absorbent structure having<br>
a longitudinal center line, a body facing surface and an<br>
undergarment facing surface, said absorbent structure comprising<br>
a liquid-pervious topsheet defining said body facing surface, a<br>
liquid-impervious backsheet defining said undergarment facing<br>
surface and a liquid-absorbent core disposed between said<br>
topsheet and said backsheet and said absorbent structure inclusive<br>
of said body facing surface being formed in an upper layer thereof<br>
with a pair of compressed grooves of arc-shaped cross-sections<br>
arranged in bilateral symmetry about said longitudinal center<br>
line, said article being characterized in that :<br>
said topsheet is divided into a first absorbent surface zone<br>
extending in a central region thereof and a second absorbent<br>
surface zone extending outward from said first absorbent surface<br>
zone; <br>
said first absorbent surface zone is defined with a<br>
substantially smooth surface having no gathers and formed with a<br>
plurality of liquid-passages extending therethrough;<br>
said second absorbent surface zone is defined with a<br>
plurality of gathers extending substantially in parallel to said<br>
longitudinal center line; and<br>
boundary lines of said first and second absorbent surface<br>
zones in transversely opposite side regions of said body facing<br>
surface extend along said pair of compressed grooves.<br>
This invention can additionally include the following<br>
features.<br>
Of crests and troughs forming the gathers,. each of the<br>
crests defines a channel having openings thereof on second<br>
boundary lines between the first and second absorbent surface<br>
zones in longitudinally opposite end zones of the body side<br>
surface.<br>
The topsheet is. depressed into and bonded to the<br>
absorbent core at least along the pair of compressed grooves.<br>
The pair of compressed grooves describe curves,<br>
respectively, convex toward the longitudinal center line.<br>
The liquid-passages have a diameter of 0.3 - 6mm,<br>
respectively, and are distributed over said first absorbent<br>
zone at a throat area ratio of 5 ~ 60%.<br>
The liquid-passages are provided in the form of tapered<br>
capillaries.<br>
The gathers are 0.3 - 3mm high and arranged on said<br>
second absorbent surface zone at a pitch of 0.2 - 5mm<br>
transversely of the second absorbent surface zone.<br>
The first absorbent surface zone extending in the<br>
direction of the longitudinal center line and occupies 15 -<br>
70% of the body facing surface-<br>
The first and second absorbent surface zones are formed<br>
by thermoplastic sheets prepared separately of each other and<br>
sealed with each other at least along the boundary lines.<br>
The pair of side flaps extend outward from transversely<br>
opposite side edges of said core and said side flaps further<br>
extend outward in the vicinity of middle regions thereof as<br>
viewed in the direction of the longitudinal center line to<br>
define a pair of wings.<br>
^ BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a sanitary napkin<br>
as a specific embodiment of the absorbent article according<br>
to this invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a scale-enlarged schematic sectional view<br>
taken along a line X-X in Fig. 1.<br>
Details of this invention will be more fully understood<br>
from the description of a sanitary napkin as a specific<br>
embodiment of an absorbent article according to this<br>
invention given hereunder with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a sanitary napkin includes<br>
an absorbent structure symmetrically shaped about a center<br>
line 2 extending longitudinally thereof and having a body<br>
facing surface (upper surface as viewed in Figs. 1 and 2) 3<br>
and undergarment facing surface (lower surface as viewed in<br>
Figs. 1 and 2) 4. The absorbent structure 1 comprises a <br>
liquid-pervious topsheet 5 defining the body facing surface <br>
3, a liquid-impervious backsheet 6 defining the undergarment<br>
facing surface 4 and a liquid-absorbent core 7 disposed <br><br>
between these two sheets 5, 6 and being thicker than them. <br>
The topsheet 5 has a high flexibility and comprises a <br>
thermoplastic sheet 5a forming a first absorbent surface zone<br>
8 extending over a central region of the body facing surface<br>
and a thermoplastic sheet 5b forming a second absorbent<br>
surface zone 9 extending outward from the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8. The backsheet 6 also has a high flexibility<br>
and forms the entire rear surface of the absorbent structure<br>
1. The absorbent core 7 is semi-rigid but has an appropriate<br>
compressive stability. Transversely opposite side edges 7a<br>
of the absorbent core 7 describe a pair of curves which are<br>
convex toward the longitudinal center line 2 .<br>
A section (sheet 5b) of the topsheet 5 extending<br>
outward beyond a peripheral edge of the absorbent core 7 is<br>
put flat together with a section of the backsheet 6 also<br>
extending outward beyond the peripheral edge of the absorbent<br>
core 7 to form a pair of side flaps 10, 10, a pair of end<br>
flaps 14, 14 and a pair of wings 10a, 10a. Each of the wings<br>
10a, 10a extends outward from the associated side flap 10 in<br>
the vicinity of its middle zone so that the wing 10a is<br>
opposed to the associated with the curved side edge 7a of the<br>
absorbent core 7 in alignment with the longitudinally middle<br>
section of the curved side edge 7a. Such relative position<br>
of the curved side edge 7a, 7a of the absorbent core 7 and<br>
the wings 10a, 10a facilitates the napkin to be fastened to<br>
an undergarment worn by a wearer. Specifically, the side<br>
flaps 10, 10 can be easily folded along their transversely<br>
middle zones substantially over their full length back onto<br>
the lower surface of the undergarment"s crotch region without<br>
generation of undesired creases not only along the curved<br>
side edges 7a, 7a of the absorbent core 7 but also along<br>
curved side edges of the undergarment.<br>
The absorbent structure 1 formed with pairs of<br>
compressed grooves lla, lla; llb, llb on its upper and lower<br>
surfaces, respectively, which are symmetric about the<br>
longitudinal center line 2 and extend across transversely<br>
opposite lateral zones of the absorbent core 7 to describe<br>
convex curves toward the longitudinal center line 2. These<br>
compressed grooves lla, lla; llb, llb are formed by<br>
depressing the topsheet 5 and the backsheet 6 and both<br>
surfaces of the absorbent core 7. When the napkin is put on<br>
the body, these compressed grooves lla, lla; llb, llb<br>
function as folding lines along which the second absorbent<br>
surface zone 9 extending outside the compressed grooves lla,<br>
lla; llb, llb can be bent relative to the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8. A curvature defining these compressed<br>
grooves lla, lla; llb, llb is such that the portion of the<br>
absorbent core 7 lying in the second absorbent surface zone<br>
9 may be smoothly bent and fit the curved surfaces of the .<br>
wearer"s thighs. It should be understood that the pair of<br>
compressed grooves llb, llb may be eliminated. Even when the<br>
lower surface of the absorbent core 7 is formed with the pair<br>
of compressed grooves llb, llb, the manner in which they are<br>
implemented is not limited to that as illustrated. For<br>
example, the absence of the compressed grooves llb, llb on<br>
the lower surface of the absorbent core 7 may be the pair of<br>
correspondingly deeper compressed grooves lla, lla on the<br>
upper surface of the absorbent core 7.<br>
The absorbent structure 1, particularly the first<br>
absorbent surface zone 8 has a cross-section progressively<br>
slopes down from its transverse middle toward its<br>
transversely opposite side edges. The surface of the first<br>
absorbent surface zone 8 is substantially smooth and<br>
effective to prevent menstrual discharge from flowing between<br>
the first absorbent surface zone 8 and the wearer skin by<br>
closely fitting a concave region defined between the large<br>
pudendal lips of the wearer. The first absorbent surface<br>
zone 8 extends in parallel to the longitudinal center line 2<br>
to occupy 15 - 70% of the entire body side, surface of the<br>
absorbent structure 1 and has a plurality of liguid passages<br>
12 extending through the first absorbent surface zone 8. In<br>
order to ensure that menstrual discharge can be efficiently<br>
guided through the liquid passages 12 and absorbed by the<br>
absorbent core 7, each of the liquid passages 12 is<br>
preferably provided in the form of a tapered capillary having<br>
a diameter of 0.3 - 6mm at its top with a total throat area<br>
ratio being in a range of 5 - 60% in the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8.<br>
The second absorbent surface zone 9 has a plurality of<br>
gathers 13 extending substantially in parallel to the<br>
longitudinal center line 2. The gathers 13 are preferably<br>
provided to be distributed at a pitch of 0.2 - 5mm<br>
transversely of the respective second absorbent surface zone<br>
9 and to have a height of 0.3 - 3mm in order to ensure<br>
functions such as appropriate breathability and restoring<br>
elasticity against compression between the second absorbent<br>
surface zone 9 and the wearer"s skin. Of crests and troughs<br>
forming the gathers 13, each crest is preferably formed so as<br>
to define a continuous channel in order to improve the<br>
breathability and restoring elasticity against compression.<br>
The channels of the gathers 13 open along a border 15 between<br>
the first absorbent surface zone 8 and the second absorbent<br>
surface zone 9 in the vicinity of longitudinally opposite end<br>
areas on the body facing surface 3. Menstrual discharge<br>
partially flows from the first absorbent surface zone 8 into .<br>
openings 16 of the respective channels before absorbed by the<br>
absorbent core 7. Correspondingly, a possibility that the<br>
longitudinally opposed end areas of the second absorbent<br>
surface zone 9 could be soiled with menstrual discharge is<br>
alleviated. Of the crests and the troughs forming the<br>
gathers 13, each trough may be formed at regular intervals<br>
longitudinally thereof with second liquid passages (not<br>
shown), whereby an amount of menstrual discharge flowing into<br>
the second absorbent surface zone 9 may rapidly transferred<br>
to the absorbent core 7 and the breathability may be further<br>
improved. The gathers 13 can be easily obtained, for<br>
example, by feeding a thermoplastic nonwoven fabric between<br>
a pair of heated rolls having grooves and ridges on their<br>
peripheral surfaces.<br>
The thermoplastic sheet 5a forming the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8 and the thermoplastic sheet 5b forming the<br>
second absorbent surface zone 9 are sealed with each other at<br>
least along the compressed grooves lla, lla. While the<br>
portions of the thermoplastic sheets 5a, 5b sealed with each<br>
other in this manner are necessarily of high rigidity and<br>
would otherwise irritate the wearer"s skin, the compressed<br>
grooves lla, lla effectively protect the wearer"s skin from<br>
being in direct contact with the rigid portions and irritate<br>
thereby. Generally, a thermoplastic film or thermoplastic<br>
nonwoven fabric is useful as stock material for the<br>
thermoplastic sheets 5a, 5b. Particularly in the illustrated<br>
embodiment of this invention, at least two different types of<br>
stock material may be used in a combination depending on the<br>
characteristics expected for the napkin, taking account of<br>
its unique arrangement such that the absorbent surface is<br>
divided in the first and second absorbent surface zones 8, 9.<br>
For example, the first absorbent surface zone 8 may be formed<br>
by a thermoplastic film and the second absorbent surface zone<br>
9 may be formed by a thermoplastic nonwoven fabric. It is<br>
also possible to arrange so that the first absorbent surface<br>
zone 8 has a degree of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity<br>
different from that of the second absorbent surface zone 9,<br>
for example, the former has a degree of hydrophilicity higher<br>
than that of the latter. Obviously, it is possible to use a<br>
thermoplastic nonwoven fabric as stock material for both the<br>
first and second absorbent surface zones 8, 9. In general,<br>
component fibers of the thermoplastic nonwoven fabric useful<br>
for this purpose may be selected from a wide range including<br>
polyolefine, polyester and polyamide fibers, and<br>
polyethylene/polypropylene or polyester conjugated fibers,<br>
each of 1 ~ 8 deniers. In order that a possibility of <br>
menstrual discharge staying on the absorbent surface can be<br>
alleviated and a tear strength of the absorbent surface can<br>
be improved, a fineness is preferably adjusted to be in a<br>
range of 1.5 - 6.0 deniers. The thermoplastic nonwoven<br>
fabric useful for this purpose may take various forms such as<br>
spun lace, needle punch, melt blown, thermal bond, spun bond<br>
and chemical bond nonwoven fabrics. A basis weight of such<br>
nonwoven fabrics are preferably in a range of 15 ~ 80g/m2 and<br>
more preferably in a range of 20 - 60g/m2 to assist the<br>
formation of the gathers 13.<br>
In the peripheral region of the absorbent structure 1,<br>
the topsheet 5 and the backsheet 6 are bonded to each other<br>
utilizing bonding means of well known art such as hot melt<br>
adhesive or heat-sealing technique. When the hot melt<br>
adhesive is utilized, it is important in the regions of the<br>
side flaps 10, 10, particularly in the outer regions of the<br>
side flaps including the respective wings 10a, 10a to<br>
distribute the ho.t melt adhesive (not shown) between the<br>
topsheet 5 and the. backsheet 6 as evenly as possible and<br>
thereby to improve a tear strength of the side flaps. This<br>
is for the reason that at least the wings 10a, 10a must have<br>
a desired tear strength. More specifically, the wings 10a,<br>
10a are destined to be pulled outward and downward so as to<br>
wrap the crotch region of the undergarment and to be<br>
adhesively fastened to the lower surface of the crotch<br>
region. After use of the napkin, the wings 10a, 10a are<br>
destined to be forcibly peeled off from the crotch region of<br>
the undergarment. Use of the hot melt adhesive in this<br>
manner is particularly suitable for the case in which the<br>
backsheet 6 comprises a polyolefine film (particularly<br>
polyethylene film) having a thickness less than 100,1m and a<br>
moisture-permeable property. Such film is usually made<br>
moisture-permeable by addition of filler in the form of fine<br>
grains and by subjecting the film to a process of drawing.<br>
Consequently, such film inevitably has a plurality of<br>
cleavages and its tear strength is lower than that of<br>
moisture-impermeable film. Evenly distribution of the hot<br>
melt adhesive is effective to compensate such poor tear<br>
strength.<br>
The backsheet 6 may be formed by a thermoplastic film,<br>
a fibrous sheet being relatively high in a liquid-resistance<br>
as well as in a strength, for example, a conjugated nonwoven<br>
fabric consisting of a melt blown fiber nonwoven fabric and<br>
a spun bond nonwoven fabric laminated on the outer surface<br>
thereof. The absorbent core 7 may be formed substantially by<br>
a mixture of fluff pulp and superabsorptive hydrogel <br>
particles in the form of a panel or a mat, which is entirely<br>
wrapped with a water-absorbent sheet such as tissue paper.<br>
It is possible to dispose a fibrous layer (not shown)<br>
4<br>
having a relatively low fiber density and a good cushioning<br>
property at least between the topsheet 5 and the core 7.<br>
This fibrous layer ensures the topsheet 5 to be sufficiently<br>
spaced from the upper surface of the absorbent core 7 to<br>
prevent menstrual discharge from flow back toward and exuding<br>
through the upper surface of the topsheet 5. In addition,<br>
the fibrous layer is remarkably effective to improve, in the<br>
upper layer of the absorbent structure 1, a restoring<br>
elasticity from compression and thereby to give the wearer a<br>
feeling of softness.<br>
While the sanitary napkin has been described<br>
hereinabove, this invention is applicable to the other body<br>
fluids absorbent articles such as a pad for incontinent<br>
women. Furthermore, it will be understood by those skilled<br>
in the art that various additional embodiments may be<br>
contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
this invention.<br>
The unique arrangement according to this invention<br>
makes the body fluids absorbent article, particularly such<br>
article for women very suitable for practical use. As will<br>
be apparent from the foregoing description, the first<br>
absorbent surface 2one which is most important for absorption<br>
of body fluids such as menstrual discharge closely fits a<br>
vaginal opening of the wearer to restrict a free flow of the<br>
body fluids and thereby to achieve an efficient absorption of<br>
the body fluids. On the other hand, the second absorbent<br>
surface zone is not important for absorption of the body<br>
fluids but adapted to come in contact with the wearer"s skin<br>
over a relatively large area. This second absorbent surface<br>
zone serves to improve a breathability and effectively<br>
prevents this second absorbent surface zone from sticking to<br>
the wearer"s skin due to sweating. In this way, the problems<br>
left behind unsolved by the prior art can be effectively<br>
solved.<br>
The body facing surface of the absorbent article<br>
divided into the first and second absorbent surfaces allows<br>
these two absorbent surface 2ones to be formed by different<br>
stock materials depending on the particular characteristics<br>
expected for these two absorbent surface zones. To form<br>
these two absorbent surface zones by two different stock<br>
materials, respectively, they must be bonded to each other by<br>
some means. In this case, there would otherwise occur any<br>
apprehension that the bonded region along which these two <br>
stock materials are bonded to each other might irritate the<br>
wearer"s skin. However, this invention effectively<br>
eliminates such apprehension by the compressed grooves<br><br>
extending along the bonded region and functioning to space<br>
the bonded region from the wearer"s skin. In this manner,<br>
the body facing surface of the absorbent article is reliabbLy<br>
free from any apprehensive skin irritation in spite of the<br>
presence of the bonded region.<br>

[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a body fluids absorbent article<br>
and more particularly to such an article suitable to be used<br>
by women such as a sanitary napkin/pad or pad for incontinent<br>
women.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Taking account of the particular purpose for its use, this<br>
type article is desired, in general, to have a good<br>
characteristic for body fluids such as a high absorptive<br>
property as well as a high leakage-proof property. In addition,<br>
a comfortable characteristic for the wearer"s skin such as a<br>
soft touch as well as a breathability is desired because this<br>
type article is used in direct contact with the wearer"s skin.<br>
Obviously, this type article preferably has a combination of<br>
these two characteristics. However, it is not easy for the<br>
arrangement of prior art to achieve the article satisfying these<br>
two characteristics since these two characteristics are<br>
partially antinomic to each other. For example, in the case<br>
of sanitary napkin, the napkin must be tightly placed against<br>
the wearer"s skin in order to improve a leakage-proof effect<br>
for menstrual discharge. On the other hand, such tight<br>
placement causes the napkin to stick to the wearer"s skin due<br>
to menstrual discharge itself and/or sweat and, in consequence,<br>
the wearer may suffer from an uncomfortable feeling, e.g., a<br>
sticky and/or stuffy feeling.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is well known, for example, from Japanese Patent<br>
Application Disclosure Gazette (Kokai) No. HeilO-94558 to form<br>
the article of the type herein discussed on its body facing<br>
surface with a plurality of gathers extending on the central<br>
region longitudinally of the body facing surface leaving the<br>
lateral regions intact and to form the troughs forming parts<br>
of the gathers with a plurality of liquid-passages arranged at<br>
regular intervals in the longitudinal direction of the troughs.<br>
The invention disclosed in the foregoing document claims that<br>
the liquid-passages facilitate the body fluids discharged on<br>
the article to be quickly absorbed by the absorbent core and<br>
the gathers ensure a good feeling to wear the article by<br>
preventing the body facing surface of the article from sticking<br>
to the wearer"s skin.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
However, the lateral regions of the body facing surface<br>
are substantially smooth in the article of prior art and at least<br>
these lateral regions tend to stick to the wearer"s skin due<br>
to sweating of the wearer. This may result in an uncomfortable<br>
feeling to wear, e.g., a feeling of stickiness. Another<br>
important disadvantage lies in the plurality of gathers present<br>
in the central region of the body facing surface. These gathers<br>
form a plurality of air gaps which affect absorption of<br>
menstrual discharge and thereby cause leakage of menstrual<br>
discharge. Furthermore, a relatively high rigidity of the<br>
gathers is incompatible with delicate body region of the article<br>
wearer.<br>
[0005]<br>
In view of the problem as has been described above, it<br>
is an object of this invention to provide an absorbent article,<br>
particularly a sanitary napkin improved to have both<br>
characteristics which are antinomic as has been mentioned above.<br>
More specifically to describe this, the central region of the<br>
body facing surface for which absorption of menstrual discharge<br>
is important rather than prevention of an undesirable feeling<br>
of stickiness inevitably caused as the body facing surface<br>
sticks to the wearer"s skin around her vaginal opening due to<br>
menstrual discharge and/or sweat of herself should have a high<br>
absorptive property. On the other hand, the lateral regions<br>
of the body facing surface rather unimportant for absorption<br>
of menstrual discharge and having a relatively large area over<br>
which these regions are placed against the wearer"s skin are<br>
effective to prevent the article from sticking to the wearer"s<br>
skin due to sweating of the wearer.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a body<br>
fluids absorbent article comprising an absorbent structure<br>
having a longitudinal center line, a body facing surface and<br>
an undergarment facing surface, the absorbent structure<br>
comprising a liquid-pervious topsheet defining the skin facing<br>
surface, a liquid-impervious backsheet defining the<br>
undergarment facing surface and a liquid-absorbent core<br>
disposed between the topsheet and the backsheet and the<br>
absorbent structure inclusive of the body facing surface being<br>
formed in an upper layer thereof with a pair of compressed<br>
grooves of arc-shaped cross-sections arranged in bilateral<br>
symmetry about the longitudinal center line; wherein:<br>
the topsheet is divided into a first absorbent surface<br>
zone extending in a central region thereof and a second<br>
absorbent surface zone extending outward from the first<br>
absorbent surface zone; the first absorbent surface zone is<br>
defined with a substantially smooth surface having no gathers<br>
and formed with a plurality of liquid-passages extending<br>
therethrough; the second absorbent surface zone is formed with<br>
a plurality of gathers extending substantially in parallel to<br>
the longitudinal center line; and boundary lines of the first<br>
and second absorbent surface zones in transversely opposite<br>
facing regions of the body facing surface extend along the pair<br>
of compressed grooves.<br>
[0008]<br>
This invention can additionally include the following<br>
features.<br>
[0009]<br>
(1) Of crests and troughs forming the gathers, each of<br>
the crests defines a channel having openings thereof on second<br>
boundary lines between the first and second absorbent surface<br>
zones in longitudinally opposite end zones of the body side<br>
surface.<br>
[0010]<br>
(2) The topsheet is depressed into and bonded to the<br>
absorbent core at least along the pair of compressed grooves.<br>
[0011]<br>
(3) The pair of compressed grooves describe curves,<br>
respectively, convex toward the longitudinal center line.<br>
[0012]<br>
(4) The liquid-passages have a diameter of 0.3 - 6mm,<br>
respectively, and are distributed over said first absorbent<br>
zone at a throat area ratio of 5 - 60%.<br>
[0013]<br>
(5) The liquid-passages are provided in the form of<br>
tapered capillaries.<br>
[0014]<br>
(6) The gathers are 0.3 - 3mm high and arranged on said<br>
second absorbent surface zone at a pitch of 0.2 - 5mm<br>
transversely of the second absorbent surface zone.<br>
[0015]<br>
(7) The first absorbent surface zone extending in the<br>
direction of the longitudinal center line and occupies 15 - 70%<br>
of the body facing surface.<br>
[0016]<br>
(8) The first and second absorbent surface zones are<br>
formed by thermoplastic sheets prepared separately of each<br>
other and sealed with each other at least along the boundary<br>
lines.<br>
[0017]<br>
(9) The pair of side flaps extend outward from trans-<br>
versely opposite side edges of said core and said side flaps<br>
further extend outward in the vicinity of middle regions thereof<br>
as viewed in the direction of the longitudinal center line to<br>
define a pair of wings.<br>
[0018]<br>
[Preferred Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
Details of this invention will be more fully understood<br>
from the description of a sanitary napkin as a specific<br>
embodiment of an absorbent article according to this invention<br>
given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[0019]<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a sanitary napkin includes<br>
an absorbent structure symmetrically shaped about a center line<br>
2 extending longitudinally thereof and having a body facing<br>
surface (upper surface as viewed in Figs. 1 and 2) 3 and<br>
undergarment facing surface (lower surface as viewed in Figs.<br>
1 and 2) 4. The absorbent structure 1 comprises a liquid-<br>
pervious topsheet 5 defining the body facing surface 3, a<br>
liquid-impervious backsheet 6 defining the undergarment facing<br>
surface 4 and a liquid-absorbent core 7 disposed between these<br>
two sheets 5, 6 and being thicker than them.<br>
[0020]<br>
The topsheet 5 has a high flexibility and comprises a<br>
thermoplastic sheet 5a forming a first absorbent surface zone<br>
8 extending over a central region of the body facing surface<br>
and a thermoplastic sheet 5b forming a second absorbent surface<br>
zone 9 extending outward from the first absorbent surface zone<br>
8. The backsheet 6 also has a high flexibility and forms the<br>
entire rear surface of the absorbent structure 1. The absorbent<br>
core 7 is semi-rigid but has an appropriate compressive<br>
stability. Transversely opposite side edges 7a of the<br>
absorbent core 7 describe a pair of curves which are convex<br>
toward the longitudinal center line 2.<br>
[0021]<br>
A section (sheet 5b) of the topsheet 5 extending outward<br>
beyond a peripheral edge of the absorbent core 7 is put flat<br>
together with a section of the backsheet 6 also extending<br>
outward beyond the peripheral edge of the absorbent core 7 to<br>
form a pair of side flaps 10, 10, a pair of end flaps 14, 14<br>
and a pair of wings 10a, 10a. Each of the wings 10a, 10a extends<br>
outward from the associated side flap 10 in the vicinity of its<br>
middle zone so that the wing 10a is opposed to the associated<br>
with the curved side edge 7a of the absorbent core 7 in alignment<br>
with the longitudinally middle section of the curved side edge<br>
7a. Such relative position of the curved side edge 7a, 7a of<br>
the absorbent core 7 and the wings 10a, 10a facilitates the<br>
napkin to be fastened to an undergarment worn by a wearer.<br>
Specifically, the side flaps 10, 10 can be easily folded along<br>
their transversely middle zones substantially over their full<br>
length back onto the lower surface of the undergarment" s crotch<br>
region without generation of undesired creases not only along<br>
the curved side edges 7a, 7a of the absorbent core 7 but also<br>
along curved side edges of the undergarment.<br>
[0022]<br>
The absorbent structure 1 formed with pairs of compressed<br>
grooves lla, lla; llb, llb on its upper and lower surfaces,<br>
respectively, which are symmetric about the longitudinal center<br>
line 2 and extend across transversely opposite lateral zones<br>
of the absorbent core 7 to describe convex curves toward the<br>
longitudinal center line 2. These compressed grooves lla, lla;<br>
llb, llb are formed by depressing the topsheet 5 and the<br>
backsheet 6 and both surfaces of the absorbent core 7. When<br>
the napkin is put on the body, these compressed grooves lla,<br>
lla; llb, llb function as folding lines along which the second<br>
absorbent surface zone 9 extending outside the compressed<br>
grooves lla, lla; llb, llb can be bent relative to the first<br>
absorbent surface zone 8. A curvature defining these<br>
compressed grooves lla, lla; llb, llb is such that the portion<br>
of the absorbent core 7 lying in the second absorbent surface<br>
zone 9 may be smoothly bent and fit the curved surfaces of the<br>
wearer"s thighs. It should be understood that the pair of<br>
compressed grooves llb, llb may be eliminated. Even when the<br>
lower surface of the absorbent core 7 is formed with the pair<br>
of compressed grooves llb, llb, the manner in which they are<br>
implemented is not limited to that as illustrated. For example,<br>
the absence of the compressed grooves llb, llb on the lower<br>
surface of the absorbent core 7 may be the pair of<br>
correspondingly deeper compressed grooves lla, lla on the upper<br>
surface of the absorbent core 7.<br>
[0023]<br>
The absorbent structure 1, particularly the first<br>
absorbent surface zone 8 has a cross-section progressively<br>
slopes down from its transverse middle toward its transverse ly<br>
opposite side edges. The surface of the first absorbent surface<br>
zone 8 is substantially smooth and effective to prevent<br>
menstrual discharge from flowing between the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8 and the wearer" skin by closely fitting a concave<br>
region defined between the large pudendal lips of the wearer.<br>
The first absorbent surface zone 8 extends in parallel to the<br>
longitudinal center line 2 to occupy 15 - 70% of the entire body<br>
side surface of the absorbent structure 1 and has a plurality<br>
of liquid passages 12 extending through the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8. In order to ensure that menstrual discharge<br>
can be efficiently guided through the liquid passages 12 and<br>
absorbed by the absorbent core 7, each of the liquid passages<br>
12 is preferably provided in the form of a tapered capillary<br>
having a diameter of 0.3 - 6mm at its top with a total throat<br>
area ratio being in a range of 5 - 60% in the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8.<br>
[0024]<br>
The second absorbent surface zone 9 has a plurality of<br>
gathers 13 extending substantially in parallel to the<br>
longitudinal center line 2. The gathers 13 are preferably<br>
provided to be distributed at a pitch of 0.2 - 5mm transversely<br>
of the respective second absorbent surface zone 9 and to have<br>
a height of 0.3 - 3mm in order to ensure functions such as<br>
appropriate breathability and restoring elasticity against<br>
compression between the second absorbent surface zone 9 and the<br>
wearer"s skin. Of crests and troughs forming the gathers 13,<br>
each crest is preferably formed so as to define a continuous<br>
channel in order to improve the breathability and restoring<br>
elasticity against compression. The channels of the gathers 13<br>
open along a border 15 between the first absorbent surface zone<br>
8 and the second absorbent surface zone 9 in the vicinity of<br>
longitudinally opposite end areas on the body facing surface<br>
3. Menstrual discharge partially flows from the first<br>
absorbent surface zone 8 into openings 16 of the respective<br>
channels before absorbed by the absorbent core 7.<br>
Correspondingly, a possibility that the longitudinally opposed<br>
end areas of the second absorbent surface zone 9 could be soiled<br>
with menstrual discharge is alleviated. Of the crests and the<br>
troughs forming the gathers 13, each trough may be formed at<br>
regular intervals longitudinally thereof with second liquid<br>
passages (not shown), whereby an amount of menstrual discharge<br>
flowing into the second absorbent surface zone 9 may rapidly<br>
transferred to the absorbent core 7 and the breathability may<br>
be further improved. The gathers 13 can be easily obtained,<br>
for example, by feeding a thermoplastic nonwoven fabric between<br>
a pair of heated rolls having grooves and ridges on their<br>
peripheral surfaces.<br>
[0025]<br>
The thermoplastic sheet 5a forming the first absorbent<br>
surface zone 8 and the thermoplastic sheet 5b forming the second<br>
absorbent surface zone 9 are sealed with each other at least<br>
along the compressed grooves lla, lla. While the portions of<br>
the thermoplastic sheets 5a, 5b sealed with each other in this<br>
manner are necessarily of high rigidity and would otherwise<br>
irritate the wearer"s skin, the compressed grooves lla, lla<br>
effectively protect the wearer"s skin from being in direct<br>
contact with the rigid portions and irritate thereby.<br>
Generally, a thermoplastic film or thermoplastic nonwoven<br>
fabric is useful as stock material for the thermoplastic sheets<br>
5a, 5b. Particularly in the illustrated embodiment of this<br>
invention, at least two different types of stock material may<br>
be used in a combination depending on the characteristics<br>
expected for the napkin, taking account of its unique<br>
arrangement such that the absorbent surface is divided in the<br>
first and second absorbent surface zones 8, 9. For example,<br>
the first absorbent surface zone 8 may be formed by a<br>
thermoplastic film and the second absorbent surface zone 9 may<br>
be formed by a thermoplastic nonwoven fabric. It is also<br>
possible to arrange so that the first absorbent surface zone<br>
8 has a degree of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity different<br>
from that of the second absorbent surface zone 9, for example,<br>
the former has a degree of hydrophilicity higher than that of<br>
the latter. Obviously, it is possible to use a thermoplastic<br>
nonwoven fabric as stock material for both the first and second<br>
absorbent surface zones 8,9. In general, component fibers of<br>
the thermoplastic nonwoven fabric useful for this purpose may<br>
be selected from a wide range including polyolefine, polyester<br>
and polyamide fibers, and polyethylene/polypropylene or<br>
polyester conjugated fibers, each of 1 - 8 deniers. In order<br>
that a possibility of menstrual discharge staying on the<br>
absorbent surface can be alleviated and a tear strength of the<br>
absorbent surface can be improved, a fineness is preferably<br>
adjusted to be in a range of 1.5 - 6.0 deniers. The<br>
thermoplastic nonwoven fabric useful for this purpose may take<br>
various forms such as spun lace, needle punch, melt blown,<br>
thermal bond, spun bond and chemical bond nonwoven fabrics. A<br>
basis weight of such nonwoven fabrics are preferably in a range<br>
of 15 - 80g/m2 and more preferably in a range of 20 - 60g/m2<br>
to assist the formation of the gathers 13.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the peripheral region of the absorbent structure 1,<br>
the topsheet 5 and the backsheet 6 are bonded to each other<br>
utilizing bonding means of well known art such as hot melt<br>
adhesive or heat-sealing technique. When the hot melt adhesive<br>
is utilized, it is important in the regions of the side flaps<br>
10, 10, particularly in the outer regions of the side flaps<br>
including the respective wings 10a, 10a to distribute the hot<br>
melt adhesive (not shown) between the topsheet 5 and the<br>
backsheet 6 as evenly as possible and thereby to improve a tear<br>
strength of the side flaps. This is for the reason that at least<br>
the wings 10a, 10a must have a desired tear strength. More<br>
specifically, the wings 10a, 10a are destined to be pulled<br>
outward and downward so as to wrap the crotch region of the<br>
undergarment and to be adhesively fastened to the lower surface<br>
of the crotch region. After use of the napkin, the wings 10a,<br>
10a are destined to be forcibly peeled off from the crotch region<br>
of the undergarment. Use of the hot melt adhesive in this manner<br>
is particularly suitable for the case in which the backsheet<br>
6 comprises a polyolefine film (particularly polyethylene film)<br>
having a thickness less than 100.A and a moisture-permeable<br>
property. Such film is usually made moisture-permeable by<br>
addition of filler in the form of fine grains and by subject ing<br>
the film to a process of drawing. Consequently, such film<br>
inevitably has a plurality of cleavages and its tear strength<br>
is lower than that of moisture-impermeable film. Evenly<br>
distribution of the hot melt adhesive is effective to compensate<br>
such poor tear strength.<br>
[0027]<br>
The backsheet 6 may be formed by a thermoplastic film,<br>
a fibrous sheet being relatively high in a liquid-resistance<br>
as well as in a strength, for example, a conjugated nonwoven<br>
fabric consisting of a melt blown fiber nonwoven fabric and a<br>
spun bond nonwoven fabric laminated on the outer surface thereof.<br>
The absorbent core 7 may be formed substantially by a mixture<br>
of fluff pulp and superabsorptive hydrogel particles in the form<br>
of a panel or a mat, which is entirely wrapped with a<br>
water-absorbent sheet such as tissue paper.<br>
[0028]<br>
It is possible to dispose a fibrous layer (not shown)<br>
having a relatively low fiber density and a good cushioning<br>
property at least between the topsheet 5 and the core 7. This<br>
fibrous layer ensures the topsheet 5 to be sufficiently spaced<br>
from the upper surface of the absorbent core 7 to prevent<br>
menstrual discharge from flow back toward and exuding through<br>
the upper surface of the topsheet 5. In addition, the fibrous<br>
layer is remarkably effective to improve, in the upper layer<br>
of the absorbent structure 1, a restoring elasticity from<br>
compression and thereby to give the wearer a feeling of<br>
softness.<br>
[0029]<br>
While the sanitary napkin has been described hereinabove,<br>
this invention is applicable to the other body fluids absorbent<br>
articles such as a pad for incontinent women. Furthermore, it<br>
will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
additional embodiments may be contemplated without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
[0030]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The unique arrangement according to this invention makes<br>
the body fluids absorbent article, particularly such article<br>
for women very suitable for practical use. As will be apparent<br>
from the foregoing description, the first absorbent surface<br>
zone which is most important for absorption of body fluids such<br>
as menstrual discharge closely fits a vaginal opening of the<br>
wearer to restrict a free flow of the body fluids and thereby<br>
to achieve an efficient absorption of the body fluids. On the<br>
other hand, the second absorbent surface zone is not important<br>
for absorption of the body fluids but adapted to come in contact<br>
with the wearer"s skin over a relatively large area. This<br>
second absorbent surface zone serves to improve a breathability<br>
and effectively prevents this second absorbent surface zone<br>
from sticking to the wearer"s skin due to sweating. In this<br>
way, the problems left behind unsolved by the prior art can be<br>
effectively solved.<br>
[0031]<br>
The body facing surface of the absorbent article divided<br>
into the first and second absorbent surfaces allows these two<br>
absorbent surface zones to be formed by different stock<br>
materials depending on the particular characteristics expected<br>
for these two absorbent surface zones. To form these two<br>
absorbent surface zones by two different stock materials,<br>
respectively, they must be bonded to each other by some means.<br>
In this case, there would otherwise occur any apprehension that<br>
the bonded region along which these two stock materials are<br>
bonded to each other might irritate the wearer s skin. However,<br>
this invention effectively eliminates such apprehension by the<br>
compressed grooves extending along the bonded region and<br>
functioning to space the bonded region from the wearer"s skin.<br>
In this manner, the body facing surface of the absorbent article<br>
is reliably free from any apprehensive skin irritation in spite<br>
of the presence of the bonded region.<br>
