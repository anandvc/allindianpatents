				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a quick-action coupling for<br>
pipes, with a tubular inner part, with an inner sleeve,<br>
with a clamping ring, with a toothed ring having teeth<br>
and with an outer sleeve.<br>
In pipeline construction, in particular for domestic<br>
pipeline systems, that is to say for the indoor supply<br>
of hot and cold water for sanitary purposes and for the<br>
heating circuits, plastic pipelines are increasingly<br>
being used. Above all in heating systems with hot water<br>
lines laid in the floors, at least two couplings must<br>
be produced for each heatable room. Approximately 2 0 to<br>
3 0 couplings are necessary for a normal one-family<br>
house. The couplings must be capable of being installed<br>
quickly, reliably and permanently.<br>
DE 196 45 853 C1 discloses a generic quick-action<br>
coupling. A connection region of an adapter receives<br>
the end of a pipeline. The connection region of the<br>
adapter comprises, from the outside inward, a conically<br>
designed connection sleeve and a clamping cone which<br>
cooperates with the connection sleeve and which is held<br>
under spring tension in the axial direction by a<br>
spring. The clamping cone has, on the side facing the<br>
pipe, toothing elements which engage into the outer<br>
wall of the pipe. The pipeline end is introduced into<br>
the adapter. When a retaining clip which holds the<br>
spring under pretension is drawn away, the spring<br>
presses the clamping cone with a defined force into the<br>
likewise conically designed clamping sleeve, and the<br>
toothing elements engage into the pipe outer wall. This<br>
quick-action coupling is used as part of an adaptable<br>
pipeline installation system for medium-carrying<br>
pipelines for a wide pressure and temperature range.<br>
The quick-action coupling is composed essentially of<br>
metal parts.<br>
DE 101 57 304.9 (not published prior to the present<br>
specification) describes a quick-action coupling for<br>
pipes, which comprises an adapter with a coupling<br>
region and with a connection region, the coupling<br>
region being designed for coupling to a pipe connection<br>
part suitable for it, and the connection region being<br>
designed for connection to a free end of a pipeline.<br>
Arranged in the connection region, around the end of<br>
the pipeline, are a part-circular toothed ring, a part-<br>
circular clamping cone and a circular connection<br>
sleeve. The adapter has, in the connection region, at<br>
least two latching fingers arranged on a circle and<br>
extending in the axial direction, in each case with<br>
latching steps projecting in the radial direction, and<br>
a driver ring for driving the connection sleeve is<br>
arranged in the connection region so as to be axially<br>
displaceable with respect to the latching fingers and<br>
so as to be radially latchable with respect to the<br>
latching steps.<br>
DE 102 12 735.2 (not published prior to the present<br>
specification) describes a quick-action coupling for <br>
pipes, which comprises a tubular inner part, a clamping<br>
ring and a toothed ring having part-circular teeth. The<br>
quick-action coupling has an outer sleeve and an inner<br>
sleeve which consists of at least two parts.<br>
Proceeding from this prior art, the object of the<br>
invention is to specify a quick-action coupling which <br>
is constructed from as few individual parts as<br>
possible, which is compatible with the pipeline system<br>
and which can be produced cost-effectively both in<br>
terms of production and in terms of assembly on the<br>
construction site. The quick-action coupling is to<br>
ensure an absolutely secure and reliable connection,<br>
even without the aid of installation tools.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a quick-action<br>
coupling for pipes, with a tubular inner part, with an<br>
inner sleeve, with a clamping ring, with a toothed ring<br>
having teeth and with an outer sleeve, the outer sleeve<br>
having a cylindrical region with at least two different<br>
inside diameters and a clamping region designed<br>
conically on the inside.<br>
The quick-action coupling is constructed from as few<br>
individual parts as possible. The assembly of the<br>
quick-action coupling together with the pipeline system<br>
on the construction site involves as few steps as<br>
possible.<br>
To achieve a simple handing of the coupling,<br>
advantageously the inner sleeve is composed of two<br>
virtually identical halves.<br>
Handling is further simplified by the formation of<br>
holding fingers on the inner sleeve for firmly holding<br>
the toothed ring before assembly on the construction<br>
site.<br>
Preferably, the parts of the quick-action coupling are<br>
produced essentially from plastic, advantageously the<br>
outer sleeve and/or the inner sleeve being transparent.<br>
For safety reasons, that is to say for checking the<br>
correct connection of the coupling to the pipeline, the<br>
outer sleeve and/or the inner sleeve are/is produced<br>
from a transparent plastic. Inspection windows arranged<br>
at a suitable point may likewise be envisaged.<br>
Further features according to the invention are listed<br>
in the remaining subclaims. In support of the claims,<br>
reference is made to the description of the figures.<br>

Figure 1 shows a sectional view of the quick-action<br>
coupling 1 for connection to a pipeline which can be<br>
seen in figures 2 and 3 . The quick-action coupling 1<br>
consists of a nipple-shaped, essentially cylindrically<br>
designed inner part 2, of an inner sleeve 3, of an<br>
outer sleeve 4, of a clamping ring 5 and of a toothed<br>
ring 6. With the exception of the toothed ring 6 made<br>
from metal, all the parts of the quick-action coupling<br>
1 can be produced from plastic material in an injection<br>
molding method. The; quick-action coupling 1 serves for<br>
making a connection between a pipeline, not illustrated<br>
here, and a pipe connection part 10. The pipeline can<br>
be pushed on, as on a nipple, and connected on the<br>
right side of the inner part 2, and the pipe connection<br>
part 10 is illustrated as being pushed on, as on a<br>
nipple, on the opposite, left side of the inner part 2.<br>
On the outside of the cylindrical inner part 2 are<br>
formed grooves 21 in which O-ring seals 22 are<br>
arranged. This ensures that the medium in the pipeline<br>
system is sealed off outwardly. Two different<br>
projections 23, 24 are formed on the outer<br>
circumference of the inner part 2 approximately in the<br>
middle between the two nipple-shaped regions having the<br>
grooves 21 and the O-ring seals 22. A first projection<br>
23 serves as a stop for the pipe connection part 10 and<br>
a second projection 24 serves for receiving the inner<br>
sleeve 3.<br>
The inner sleeve 3 is constructed from at least two<br>
part-circular parts, for example from two half shells<br>
31, 32. The half shells 31, 32 of the inner sleeve 3<br>
are produced in a mold on a plastic injection molding<br>
plant, can be connected to one another by means of a<br>
small web 39 and are produced in pairs. The inner<br>
sleeve 3 may also be produced from a plurality of part-<br>
circular shell parts 31, 32. Further projections 33, 34<br>
are formed on the inside of the inner sleeve 3. A<br>
groove 35 having a defined geometry is formed between<br>
the first projection 33 and the second projection 34.<br>
The geometry of this groove 35 coincides exactly with<br>
the geometry of the second projection 24 of the inner<br>
part 2. During the premounting of the quick-action<br>
coupling 1, the shell parts 31, 32 are laid on the<br>
inner part 2 and folded shut. In this case, the groove<br>
35 is filled exactly with the second projection 24 of<br>
the inner part 2. The coincidental geometries of the<br>
groove 35 and of the projection 24 rule out a faulty<br>
premounting.<br>
The inner sleeve 3 has on the outside, in the region of<br>
the projections 33, 34, an external thread 3 6 which<br>
cooperates with an internal thread 41 formed on the<br>
inside of the outer sleeve 4. A plurality of fingers 37<br>
are formed on the inner sleeve 3 on the right side of<br>
the latter, that is to say on the pipeline side. At the<br>
free ends of the fingers 37, the radially outward-<br>
pointing surfaces of the fingers 37 are designed in<br>
such a way that, at least during premounting, the<br>
toothed ring 6 is carried by these finger outer<br>
surfaces. The fingers 37 are relatively slender and are<br>
integrally formed resiliently on the inner sleeve 3 .<br>
The fingers 37 may also be formed by a plurality of<br>
slots in the wall of the inner sleeve 3. Owing to the<br>
pretension of the resilient fingers 37, during<br>
premounting the toothed ring 6 cannot come loose from<br>
the inner sleeve 3 and cannot easily be lost. If the<br>
toothed ring 6 made from metal is designed continuously<br>
over 3 60° on the outer circumference, the shell parts<br>
31, 32 are also partially held together after being<br>
folded shut around the inner part 1. The premounting of<br>
the quick-action coupling 1 is thereby further<br>
simplified.<br>
On the pipeline side, the clamping ring 5 is arranged,<br>
following the toothed ring 6, within the outer sleeve<br>
4. The outer sleeve 4 encloses the clamping ring 5, the<br>
toothed ring 6 and the inner sleeve 3 in succession.<br>
The outer sleeve 4 has one behind the other, as seen<br>
from the pipeline, four different regions with<br>
different tasks: a conical region with a conically<br>
designed inner surface 42 which cooperates with the<br>
likewise conically designed outer surface 52 of the<br>
clamping ring 5, a following first cylindrical region<br>
43 with an inside diameter d1, for receiving the outer<br>
wall 61 of the toothed ring 6 and the fingers 37 of the<br>
inner sleeve 3, a wider cylindrical region 44 having<br>
the internal thread 41, with an inside diameter d2, and<br>
a final cylindrical region 45 with an inside diameter<br>
d3 for firmly holding the shell parts 31, 32 of the<br>
inner sleeve 3. The inner sleeve 3 has a rim region 38<br>
with a larger outside diameter than the rest of the<br>
outer sleeve. This rim region acts as a stop 3 8 for the<br>
outer sleeve 4 when the outer sleeve 4 is being screwed<br>
on.<br>
The clamping ring 5 is designed conically on the outer<br>
surface area 52 and is adapted correspondingly to the<br>
conical inner region 42 of the outer sleeve 4.<br>
Furthermore, the clamping ring 5 has at least one<br>
projection 53 in the inner region. The projections 53<br>
serve for increasing the pressure which acts on the<br>
pipeline when the cjuick-action coupling 1 is in the<br>
state assembled together with the pipeline. The lateral<br>
surface area 52 of the conical clamping ring 5 is<br>
always, at least in regions, in contact with the<br>
conical inner surface 42 of the outer sleeve 4 at any<br>
time, that is to say both after premounting and in the<br>
ready-installed state. The inner sleeve 3 and/or the<br>
outer sleeve 4 are/is manufactured from transparent<br>
material, for example plastic.<br>
The inner sleeve 3, the toothed ring 6 and the clamping<br>
ring 5 are illustrated three-dimensionally in figure 2.<br>
In order to make mounting easier, the inner sleeve 3<br>
may be manufactured from two half shells 31 and 32, the<br>
half shells 31 and 32 being connected by means of a web<br>
39. All the other reference symbols correspond to those<br>
of figure 1. The toothed ring 6 has, on the inner<br>
circumference, teeth 62 for the retention of the<br>
pipeline. The conical outer surface 52 and the<br>
projections 53 have already been described with<br>
reference to figure 1. The conical clamping ring 5 has<br>
a slot 54. The clamping ring 5 is pretensioned before<br>
the first introduction into the conical region of the<br>
outer sleeve 4. The pretensioning of the clamping ring<br>
5 serves for holding the toothed ring 6 nondisplaceably<br>
on the fingers 37 of the inner sleeve 3.<br>
The mounting of the quick-action coupling 1 takes place<br>
in that, in a first step, after the O-rings 22 have<br>
been placed into the grooves 21 of the inner part 2,<br>
the two halves 31 and 32 are applied to the inner part<br>
2 with an appropriate fit, the projection 24 of the<br>
inner part 2 engaging into the groove 3 5 of the inner<br>
sleeve 3. The projection 24 fits exactly with the<br>
groove 35. The two halves 31 and 32 are manufactured in<br>
such a way that, in the closed folded-shut state, a<br>
closed external thread 36 is obtained which cooperates<br>
with the internal thread 41 of the outer sleeve 4. In a<br>
second step, the toothed ring 6 is pushed onto the<br>
fingers 37 of the folded-together inner sleeve 3 and is<br>
held firmly on the outer surfaces of the fingers 37.<br>
In a third step, the clamping ring 5 is introduced<br>
under pretension into the outer sleeve 4. Finally, in a<br>
fourth step, the outer sleeve 4 is screwed onto the<br>
inner sleeve 3 as far as the stop 38. The quick-action<br>
coupling 1 is thus premounted for installation on the<br>
construction site. During the introduction of the pipe<br>
connection part 10, latching fingers 17, which are<br>
formed resiliently on the inner sleeve 3, latch into a<br>
groove 18 of the pipe connection part 10. The groove 18<br>
can be seen in figures 1, 3 and 4. The arrangement of<br>
the latching fingers 17 on the half shells of the inner<br>
sleeve 3 can best be seen in figure 2.<br>
The functioning of the quick-action coupling 1 is<br>
illustrated in figures 3 and 4. In the pressureless<br>
state, according to figure 3, a pipeline 20 is<br>
introduced into the quick-action coupling 1 as far as<br>
the first projection 34 of the inner sleeve 3. When the<br>
pipeline 20 is subjected to pressure, the situation<br>
according to figure 4 arises. The pipeline 20 is<br>
displaced somewhat away from the projection 34 of the<br>
inner sleeve 3 and is held firmly by virtue of the<br>
teeth 62 arranged in the toothed ring 6 and by means of<br>
the projections 53 of the clamping ring 5, so that a<br>
secure connection is obtained.<br>
Figure 5 shows an application of the quick-action<br>
coupling 1. In each case two quick-action couplings 1,<br>
1' are connected to the ends of a pipe connection part<br>
10' which is designed here, for example, as a T-<br>
fitting. To check for a secure connection, the quick-<br>
action couplings 1, 1' have inspection windows 19 or<br>
they consist of transparent material. During the<br>
connection of the coupling to the T-fitting 10', an<br>
acoustic signal in the form of a "click" is generated<br>
as a result of the latching of the latching fingers 17<br>
into the groove 18.<br>
Figures 6 to 10 show a second exemplary embodiment of<br>
the quick-action coupling.<br>
Figure 6 shows a sectional view of the quick-action<br>
coupling 101 for connection to a pipeline 120 which can<br>
be seen still outside the quick-action coupling. The<br>
inner sleeve 103, onto which the outer sleeve 104 is<br>
screwed in turn, is arranged over a nipple-shaped inner<br>
part 102 which serves as a carrier for the pipeline<br>
120. Inside the quick-action coupling 101, the inner<br>
sleeve 103 is followed, as seen in the direction of the<br>
pipeline 120, by the toothed ring 106 and the clamping<br>
ring 105. The inner sleeve 103 is constructed in two<br>
parts from two half shell halves 107 and 108, as is<br>
shown in figure 7 described in more detail below. The<br>
inner sleeve 103 has an external thread 109 which<br>
cooperates with the internal thread 110 arranged on the<br>
outer sleeve 104. The clamping ring 105 is designed<br>
conically on the lateral surface area 111 so as to be<br>
adapted correspondingly to the conical inner region of<br>
the outer sleeve.<br>
Furthermore, the clamping ring 105 has at least one<br>
projection 118 in the inner region. The inner sleeve<br>
103 has projections 112 which engage into the grooves<br>
113 arranged in the inner part. The inner part 102 has<br>
at least two tubular regions 114 and 115 with different<br>
diameters. For sealing off, two O-rings 116 and 117 are<br>
attached in each case on the tubular regions 114 and<br>
115 of the inner part. The stop 119 serves for limiting<br>
the travel of the outer sleeve 104. The inner part 103<br>
has, at one end, a prolongation 125, into which<br>
clearances 121 are introduced in order to save<br>
material. The inner sleeve 103 and/or the outer sleeve<br>
104 are/is manufactured from transparent material, for<br>
example plastic.<br>
The inner sleeve 103, the toothed ring 106 and the<br>
clamping ring 105 are illustrated three-dimensionally<br>
in figure 7. In order to make mounting possible, the<br>
inner sleeve is manufactured from two half shells 107<br>
and 108, the half shells 107 and 108 being connected by<br>
means of a web 126. All the other reference symbols<br>
correspond to those of figure 6. Moreover, this<br>
embodiment of the inner sleeve 103 has no clearances<br>
121 on the prolongation 125.<br>
The toothed ring 106 has, on the inner circumference,<br>
teeth 127 for retention of the pipeline 120.<br>
The clamping ring 105 has an interruption 123 . The<br>
conical region 111 and the projection 118 have already<br>
been described with regard to figure 6.<br>
The mounting of the quick-action coupling takes place<br>
in that, in a first step, after the O-rings 116 and 117<br>
have been put in place, the two halves 107 and 108 are<br>
applied to the inner part 102 with an appropriate fit,<br>
the projections 112 of the inner sleeve 103 engaging<br>
into the grooves 1.13 of the inner part. The two halves<br>
107 and 108 are manufactured in such a way that, in the<br>
closed state, a closed external thread 9 is obtained<br>
which c6operates with the internal thread 110 of the<br>
outer sleeve.<br>
In the second step, the clamping ring 105 and the<br>
toothed ring 106 are introduced into the outer sleeve<br>
104.<br>
Finally, in the third step, the outer sleeve 104 is<br>
screwed onto the inner sleeve 103 as far the stop 119.<br>
The quick-action coupling 101 is thus mounted for<br>
installation.<br>
The function of the quick-action coupling 101 is<br>
illustrated in figures 8 and 9. In the pressureless<br>
state, according to figure 103, the pipeline 120 is<br>
introduced into the quick-action coupling 101 as far as<br>
the inner stop 128. When the pipeline 120 is subjected<br>
to pressure, the situation according to figure 9<br>
arises. The pipeline 120 is displaced somewhat away<br>
from the stop 128 and is held firmly by virtue of the<br>
teeth 127 arranged in the toothed ring 6 and by means<br>
of the clamping ring 105, so that a secure connection<br>
is obtained.<br>
Figure 10 shows an application of the quick-action<br>
coupling 101. In each case two quick-action couplings<br>
101, 101' are connected to the ends of a fitting 129.<br>
To check for a secure connection, the quick-action<br>
couplings 101, 101' have inspection windows 130, 130'<br>
or they consist of a transparent material. During the<br>
connection of the coupling to the fitting, an acoustic<br>
signal in the form of a "click" is generated.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment of the quick-action<br>
coupling is shown in figures 11 to 19.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a detail of a pipeline system<br>
with two quick-action couplings. The quick-action<br>
coupling is constructed from an adapter 2 01, 201' and a<br>
pipe connection part 202. The adapter 201, 201'<br>
consists of a coupling region 203, which is designed<br>
complementarily to a coupling reception region 204 of<br>
the pipe connection part 202, and of a connection<br>
region 2 05. By the adapter 2 01, 201' and the pipe<br>
connection part 202 being designed complementarily, a<br>
pipeline connection can be made simply and quickly. The<br>
connection region 205 of the adapter 2 01 serves for<br>
connection to one end 206 of a pipeline 207 and is<br>
described in more detail particularly with reference to<br>
figures 13 to 16. The pipeline system of figure 11<br>
comprises a T-shaped pipe connection part 202 with the<br>
possibility of connecting the ends 206 of three<br>
pipelines 207. The pipelines 207 may be produced from<br>
plastic, from composite metal/plastic materials or from<br>
light metal materials.<br>
In figure 11, two pipeline ends 206 are illustrated as<br>
being connectable to two coupling reception regions<br>
204, 204' arranged at an angle of 90° to one another. A<br>
blind plug 208, not a pipeline, is illustrated as being<br>
connectable to the third coupling reception region<br>
204". The exemplary embodiment of figure 11 shows that,<br>
by means of the combination of a T-shaped pipe<br>
connection part 202 and of a blind plug 208, different<br>
arrangements of pipeline ends 206 can be connected to<br>
one another. It is also conceivable that the coupling<br>
reception regions 204, 204', 204" have different line<br>
inside diameters, so that even pipelines with a<br>
different diameter can be connected to one another. On<br>
account of this high adaptability to different<br>
operating conditions, the pipe connection part 202 is<br>
therefore also designated as a module 202. The blind<br>
plug 208 has a coupling region 203" which is designed<br>
identically to the coupling region 203, 203' of the<br>
adapter 201, 201'.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates the detail of the pipeline system<br>
of figure 11 once again, but in the assembled state<br>
here. The inspection windows 209, 209' are illustrated<br>
in the connection regions 205, 205'. It can be observed<br>
through these inspection windows 2 09, 2 09' that the<br>
operation of connecting the adapter 2 01 to the pipe 2 07<br>
is concluded completely and that a secure connection<br>
has been made.<br>
The operation of connecting the pipeline end 206 to the<br>
adapter 201 is described in the individual phases of<br>
the operation with reference to the sections of figures<br>
13 to 16.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates the end 206 of a pipeline 207 and<br>
an adapter 201. The adapter 201 is illustrated as it is<br>
delivered on the construction site. The adapter 2 01<br>
consists of the connection region 205 and, adjoining<br>
the latter in the axial direction, of the coupling<br>
region 203 and is produced essentially from plastic<br>
materials, for example in an injection molding method.<br>
The end 206 of the pipeline 207 made from plastic is<br>
calibrated internally before assembly, that is to say<br>
is set to the correct inside diameter, and is chamfered<br>
from the end, on the inside, to form a chamfer 210. As<br>
seen from the inside outward, the following individual<br>
parts are evident in the connection region 2 05 of the<br>
adapter 201: a driver ring 211, a toothed ring 212, a<br>
clamping cone 213 and a connecting sleeve 214.<br>
At least two latching fingers 215 are formed in the<br>
connection region 205 of the adapter 201. At the<br>
boundary between the connection region 2 05 and the<br>
coupling region 203 is formed a stop 216 which serves<br>
for limiting the axial movement of the connecting<br>
sleeve 214 with respect to the connection region 205 of<br>
the adapter 201. The stop 216 is designed as an all-<br>
round continuous annular projection on the outer<br>
circumference of the adapter 2 01 . The driver ring 211<br>
is arranged so as to fit into a groove 217 on the<br>
inside of the connecting sleeve 214.<br>
The fit between the connecting sleeve 214 and the<br>
driver ring 211 isVsq accurate that, in the event of<br>
the axial movement of the driver ring 211, the<br>
connecting sleeve 214 also executes the same axial<br>
movement. Both the driver ring 211 and the connecting<br>
sleeve 214 'are designed continuously over the full<br>
circle circumference, at least in the region of the<br>
groove 217, and form a stable and load-bearing<br>
combination. During the assembly of the adapter 2 01<br>
together with the pipeline end 206, this combination<br>
serves for transmitting the forces which have to be<br>
applied for assembly purposes.<br>
The driver ring 211 is designed in the manner of an<br>
annular disk 211. Part-circular and axially continuous<br>
orifices 218 are cut out in the annular disk 211. An<br>
orifice 218 is provided in each case for each latching<br>
finger 215. The latching fingers 215 are arranged on a<br>
circle at a distance from the inner wall of the<br>
connection region 205. Two, three or more latching<br>
fingers 215, which all extend in the axial direction of<br>
the adapter 2 01, may be formed. The latching fingers<br>
215 have a plurality of latching steps 219 which are<br>
formed on the latching fingers 215 so as to project in<br>
the radial direction. The driver ring 211 has a<br>
latching nose 220 in each of the orifices 218, said<br>
latching noses beincf formed so as to project inward in<br>
the radial direction and cooperating with the latching<br>
steps 219 of the latching fingers 215.<br>
The toothed ring 212 and the clamping cone 213 are<br>
designed part-circularly, that is to say not all-round<br>
continuously. The toothed ring 212 and the clamping<br>
cone 213 are produced so as to be open on part of their<br>
circumference, so that, when a force acts on the<br>
toothed ring 212 and on the clamping cone 213 in the<br>
radial direction, these can vary in diameter, that is<br>
to say narrow. The toothed ring 212 is fitted into a<br>
depression 221 on the inside of the clamping cone 213.<br>
The toothed ring 212 and the clamping cone 213 thus<br>
also form a stable unit. When pressure is exerted on<br>
the clamping cone 213 from the outside inward, the<br>
diameter of the toothed ring 212 will be reduced. The<br>
toothed ring 212 is produced from a metal band by<br>
stamping, cutting and bending and has a profile which<br>
accords exactly with the tasks of the toothed ring.<br>
Like all the other components of the quick-action<br>
coupling, the clamping cone 213 is produced from<br>
plastic in an injection molding method.<br>
In the delivery state, the clamping cone 213 is located<br>
inside the connecting sleeve 214 on a circle having the<br>
largest possible diameter.. The driver ring 211, which<br>
drives the connecting sleeve 214 in the axial<br>
direction, is in latch engagement by means of the<br>
latching noses 220 with that of the latching steps 219<br>
which is furthest away from the coupling region 203, as<br>
seen in the axial direction. The end face of the driver<br>
ring 211 is at the same height as or is somewhat higher<br>
than the end face of the latching fingers 215. The<br>
clamping cone 213 lies on the end face of the driver<br>
ring 211. O-ring seals, which may be arranged in<br>
further peripheral grooves for sealing off the medium<br>
outwardly, are omitted in figure 13.<br>
In figure 14, in comparison with figure 13, the adapter<br>
201 has just been placed with the connection region 205<br>
onto the end 206 of the pipeline 207. On the<br>
construction site, the installer will pick up with one<br>
hand the free end 206 of the already laid flexible<br>
plastic pipeline 207 and bend it away from the wall or<br>
from the floor as far as necessary for working and with<br>
the other hand slip the adapter 201 onto the pipeline<br>
end 206. In the state illustrated in figure 14,<br>
pressure has still not been exerted on the end 206 or<br>
on the adapter 201. The end 206 of the pipeline 207<br>
just touches the driver ring 211 and the clamping cone<br>
213 has not yet been moved axially. In the state shown<br>
in figure 14, as in the state shown in figure 13, the<br>
clamping cone 213 can still be seen in the inspection<br>
window 2 09. It can thus be observed through the<br>
inspection window 2 09 that the clamping cone 213 has<br>
not yet moved with respect to the connecting sleeve<br>
214.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates the adapter 201 once again, but<br>
after being slipped onto the pipeline 207 and after<br>
pressing together. The adapter 201 together with the<br>
latching fingers 215 in the connection region 2 05 has<br>
been pushed as far as possible through the orifice 218.<br>
The latching nose 220 of the driver ring 211 in this<br>
case jumps over the latching steps 219 of the latching<br>
fingers 215. The jump over the latching steps is<br>
detected by the installer as a signal perceptible<br>
audibly and by feel. Since the end 206 of the pipeline<br>
2 07 lay on the driver ring 211 before the pushing<br>
movement, as a consequence of the pushing movement the<br>
clamping cone 213 is moved in the axial direction with<br>
respect to the connecting sleeve 214 and with respect<br>
to the pipeline 2 07. Between the state shown in figure<br>
14 and the state shown in figure 15, the pipeline 2 07<br>
does not move with respect to the connecting sleeve<br>
214. Only the adapter 201 together with the latching<br>
fingers 215 and the clamping cone 213 move with respect<br>
to the pipeline 207.<br>
The adapter 2 01 is pushed into the connecting sleeve<br>
214 as far as the stop 216. Since the clamping cone 213<br>
is designed conically on the outside, and since the<br>
connecting sleeve 214 is likewise designed conically on<br>
the inside, the clamping cone 213 and therefore also<br>
the toothed ring 212 are pressed together in the radial<br>
direction, that is to say in the direction of the outer<br>
wall of the pipeline 207, as a consequence of this<br>
axial movement. In contrast to many other quick-action<br>
couplings, for example those with a bayonet fastening<br>
or a union nut, coupling is not made by means of a<br>
rotational or screwing movement, but by means of a<br>
linear pushing movement. The adapter 201 is slipped<br>
onto the end 206 of the pipeline 207 with a push in the<br>
axial direction and can be connected, without a tool,<br>
first to the pipeline 207 and subsequently to the pipe<br>
connection part 202 or to the module 202.<br>
The toothed ring 212 made from metal has, on the inner<br>
circumference, a multiplicity of teeth 222 arranged in<br>
a distributed manner, of which two teeth 222 can be<br>
seen in figure 15. The metal teeth 222 cut into the<br>
outer wall of the plastic pipeline 207. The clamping<br>
cone 213 is no longer visible in the inspection window<br>
2 09. By observing the signal, perceptible audibly and<br>
by feel, from the latching noses 220 which jump over<br>
the latching steps 219, and by observing the inspection<br>
window 2 09, the installer can make sure that the<br>
adapter 201 has been connected to the end 206 of the<br>
pipeline 2 07 securely and completely. A clamping cone<br>
213 cannot be seen in the inspection window or<br>
inspection windows 2 09, but only the latching fingers<br>
215 or, depending on the annular position of the<br>
connecting sleeve 214 with respect to the latching<br>
fingers 215, the outer wall of the pipe 207. In the<br>
state shown in figure 15, the pipeline system is still<br>
pressureless, that is to say the adapter has not yet<br>
been connected to the pipe connection part 2 02 or to<br>
the module 2 02 and medium pressure still does not act<br>
on the pipeline system.<br>
Figure 16 shows once again the connection of the<br>
adapter 201 to the e&gt;nd 206 of the pipeline 207. In the<br>
state shown in figure 16, in contrast to the state<br>
shown in figure 15, the adapter 2 01 has been connected<br>
to the pipe connection part 202, not illustrated here,<br>
and the pipeline system has been subjected to medium<br>
pressure. Due to the medium pressure, the pipeline 2 07<br>
and the clamping cone 213 are pressed slightly out of<br>
the adapter 201.<br>
This state is illustrated, slightly exaggerated, in<br>
figure 16, in order to understand the conditions more<br>
clearly. Owing to the pull-out movement of the clamping<br>
cone 213 as a consequence of the pressure rise, said<br>
clamping cone being held radially by the connecting<br>
sleeve 214, the diameter will be further reduced. The<br>
teeth 221 of the toothed ring 212- are cut further into<br>
the outer wall of the pipeline' end 206. In the regions<br>
of the toothed ring 212 where there are no teeth 222<br>
stamped away inward, the toothed ring has an<br>
essentially cylindrical profile and will come to lie<br>
flat on the outer wall of the pipeline 207. The special<br>
profile of the toothed ring 212 prevents the metal<br>
teeth 222 from cutting too deeply into the plastic<br>
material. The special design of the inner wall of the<br>
clamping cone 213 with a likewise cylindrical region<br>
and with further plastic teeth 223 also contributes to<br>
ensuring that the teeth 222, 223 do not cut into the<br>
plastic material more deeply than an exactly defined<br>
depth. This prevents the pipeline end 206 from being<br>
cut off by the metal teeth 222 in the event of an<br>
excessive pull-out force.<br>
Figures 17 to 19 illustrate further applications of the<br>
quick-action coupling. Figure 17 shows the quick-action<br>
coupling from figures 11 to 16 in conjunction with a<br>
connection 225 for fittings in the sanitary sector.<br>
Figure 18 shows a pipe connection part 2 02 with a blind<br>
plug 208 and with two adapters 201, 231. The adapter<br>
231 has a larger diameter than the adapter 201. This is<br>
intended to indicate that, using the same module 2 02,<br>
reductions or transitions with a different diameter can<br>
also be produced. The module 2 02 may be produced from<br>
plastic or from metal and is thus adaptable to<br>
different pipeline materials.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates two adapters 201 and two modules<br>
2 02 which are connected to one another by means of an<br>
intermediate piece 232. The intermediate piece 232 has,<br>
on two opposite sides, coupling regions 23 5 which are<br>
designed identically to the coupling regions 205 from<br>
figures 11 to 16. This is intended to indicate that<br>
what are known as manifolds or distributor fittings can<br>
also be produced by means of any number of modules 2 02<br>
and intermediate pieces 232. Instead of a further<br>
module 202, a transition piece 236 with a thread, for<br>
example an external thread, may also be slipped onto<br>
the intermediate piece 232. The design of the coupling<br>
region 235 is illustrated in figure 19 with four outer<br>
part-circular and resilient regions 238 having latching<br>
hooks 239. The latching hooks 239 in figure 19 are<br>
designed to point radially inward, but, in a<br>
correspondingly reversed design of the coupling region<br>
23 5, may also be designed to point outward.<br>
The advantages associated with the invention lie, in<br>
particular, in a simple premounting of the quick-action<br>
coupling itself. On the other hand, it affords a secure<br>
connection of the pipeline to the coupling. The quick-<br>
action coupling is distinguished by particularly few<br>
individual parts which can easily be produced.<br>
