The Invention relates to inositolglycans having insulin-like action, which are suitable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
tt is known that the metabolic action of insulin also causes the formation of low molecular weight compounds which also have insulin-like action (US 4,446,064). A nunTberofjnositQlqlycan compounds have already been proposed which have  39 insulin-like action {WO 96/14075, JP 6/293790, JP 4/120089)<br>
Diabetes type II, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is accompanied by insulin resistance of the peripheral tissue, such as muscle or fatty tissue. The glucose utilization, which is thereby reduced, is caused by a lack of insulin stimulation of glucose transport and subsequent metabolic processes.<br>
in attempting to find further active compounds having insulin-like action, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention have in vitro insulin-like action, exhibit good serum stability and also have insulin-like action on insulin-resistant tissues and are thus suitable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>

2)	inositol phosphate	or<br>
3)	inositol cyclophosphate.<br>
Sugar radicals are understood as meaning compounds which are derived from aldoses and ketoses having 3 to 7 carbon atoms, vi3ich can belong to the D or L<br><br>
series: these also include amino sugars or uronic acids. Examples which may be mentioned are glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, ribose, erythrose, gjyceraldehyde, sedoheptulose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, galactonic acid or mannonic acid.<br>
By disugar, saccharides are meant which consist of two sugar units. Tri-, tetra-, penta- or hexasugars are formed by acetal-like linkage of 3 to 6 sugars. The linkages can in this case occur in the a- or P-form. The linkages between the sugars preferably take place via carbon atom 1 and carbon atom 6, carbon atom 1 and carbon atom 2, and carbon atom 1 and carbon atom 4 of the respective sugars. The a-form of the linkage between the sugars is preferred.<br>
The linkage of A to Z takes place, for example, via one of the oxygen atoms of Z or via one of the carbon atoms of Z, preferably via the carbon atom of the CH2 group of Z. The linkage oftheradlcalsforA 10) to 12) preferably takes place via a carbon atom of Z, the other linkages of A preferably take place via an oxygen atom of Z.<br>
The linkage of R to Z takes place analogously to the linkages of the di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- or hexasugars. Furthermore, the linkage from R to Z can also be replaced one or more times by -CH2 - or -S-.<br>
If the sugar is substituted, the substitution preferably takes place on the hydrogen atom of an OH group of the sugars.<br>
The term insulin-resistant tissue is understood as meaning, for example, rat fat cells which no longer contain any insulin receptor.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can contain one or more phosphate groups which can also be additionally derivatized by a phosphate protective group. Phosphate protective groups are, for example, phenyl, benzyl or hydroxypropylnitnle (Houben Weyl, Methoden der Organisdien Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 12/1 or Volume 12/2; Teilheimer, Synthetic Methods of Organic Chemistry, Vol 45).<br><br>
Physiologically tolerable salts of the compound of the formula I are in particular understood as meaning pharmaceutical ly utiiizable or nontoxic salts. Such salts are formed, for example, from compounds of the formula I which contain acidic groups, e.g. phosphates or sulfates, with alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as, for example, Na, K, Mg and Ca, and also with physiologically tolerable organic amines, such as, for example, triethylamine and tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine. Compounds of the formula I which contain basic groups, e.g. an amino group, form salts with inorganic acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid and with organic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumahc acid, tartaric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Compounds in which basic and acidic groups are present in equal number form interna! salts and are not dependent on a third salt component.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of the compound of the formula I, which comprises synthesizing the inositolglycan stepwise from protected sugar and inositol preojrsors, then adding the radical A and removing from the compound obtained one or more protective groups introduced temporarily for the protection of other functions and converting the compound of the formula I thus obtained, if appropriate, into its physiologically tolerable salt.<br>
The synthesis of the di- to polysugars is carried out by knovwi processes (H. Paulsen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 21 (1982) p. 155). The trichloroacetimidate method is preferably used for the synthesis of oligosaccharides (R. R. Schmidt, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 25 (1986) 212 - 235; T. Ogawa, Tetrahedron Lett. 31 (1990) 2439 -2442).<br>
The synthesis of the phosphates is carried out with the aid of the H-phosphate and the phosphoramidite method.(W. Bannwath et al., Helvetica Chemica Acta, 70 (1987), pages 175-186; L.A. Slotin, Synthesis (1977), pages 737-752)<br>
The following are essentially possible protective groups for the hydroxyl groups of the sugars: benzyl, acetyl, benzoyl, pivaloyi, trityl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, benzylidene, cyclohexylidene or isopropylidene protective groups.<br><br>
The compounds of the formula (and their physiologically tolerable salts are primarily used as active compounds for pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of diabetes mellitus or noninsulin-dependent diabetes.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical preparation which comprises at least one compound of the formula I and/or at least one of its physiologically tolerable salts in dissolved, amorphous and/or crystalline form -preferably in amorphous and/or crystalline form.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably a solution or suspension for injection having a pH of approximately 3.0 to 9.0, preferably of approximately 5.0 to 8.5, which contains a suitable isotonicizing agent, a suitable preservative and, if appropriate, a suitable buffer, and if appropriate also a depot principle, all in sterile aqueous solution or suspension. All of the preparation constituents apart from the active compound forms the preparation excipient. Suitable isotonicizing agents are, for example, glycerol, glucose, mannitol, NaCI, calcium or magnesium compounds such as, for example, CaClj or MgCl2- Suitable preservatives are, for example, phenol, m-cresol, benzyl alcohol and/or p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters.<br>
Buffer substances which can be used, in particular for adjusting a pH of approximately 5.0 to 8.5, are, for example, sodium acetate, sodium citrate or sodium phosphate. Otherwise, physiologically acceptable dilute acids {typically HCI) or alkalis (typically NaOH) are also suitable for adjusting the pH.<br>
For the purpose of varying the profile of action of the preparation according to the invention, modified (cf. EP-B 132 769 and EP-B 132 770) and/or unmodified insulins, preferably bovine, porcine or human insulin, in particular human insulin, can also be admixed.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is prepared by bringing at least one compound of the formula I and/or at least one of its physiologically tolerable salts, if appropriate together with modified and/or unmodified insulin or insulin derivatives, into a suitable administration form using a physiologically acceptable excipient and also, i<br><br>
appropriate, using suitable additives and auxiliaries.<br>
The invention is nov/ explained in greater detail by means of the follov/ing examples.<br>

Example 2;<br>
The compounds A, C, D, E, F, G, H and I are prepared analogously to the methods according to Example 1. Table 1 shows the structural formulae, empirical fomiula and mass spectrum.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3 Pharmaceutical activity<br>
The biological activity of the compounds of the formula I according to the invention is determined with the aid of isolated fat cells from the rat.<br>
The preparation of fat cells from the rat was carried out as follows: White fatty tissue of the epididymis (Wistar rat, 160 -180 g, no food restriction) is digested with collagenase and the resulting isolated fat cells are separated off by means of filtration of undigested tissue and washed by flotation several times using Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer (KRH buffer).<br>
A)       Lipogenesis<br>
This test determines the insulin-stimulable conversion of glucose into toluene-<br><br>
soluble products {triglycerides, phospholipids, fatty acids), which promotes glucose transport and triglyceride (glycerol-3-P synthesis, esterification)/phospholipid/fatty acid synthesis including the insulin signal transmission cascade. At a glucose concentration of 2.5 mM in the test, the esterification {and not the glycerol-3-P synthesis including glucose transport) is rate-detemiining for the stimulation of lipogenesis.<br>
200 pi (3 x103 cells/ml) of rat fat cells in KRH buffer are incubated at 37°C for 90 min with 100 pi of D-[3-3H] glucose {25 mM, 0.4 pCi) in the presence or absence of insulin (10 ng/ml) or compound of the formula I according to the invention {final volume 1 ml). By addition of a toluene-soluble scintillation cocktail (10 ml), the cells are disrupted and the lipids are separated off from water-soluble products and the incubation medium. After phase separation, the radioactivity incorporated in lipid products is determined directly without removal of the aqueous phase by scintillation measurement ([3H]lipid [dpmxIO"3]). A control value (incubation under identical conditions but without cells) is subtracted from this radioactivity. The lipogenesis rate is linear up to 120 min. The maximum stimulation factor - this is the ratio of the incubation result with insulin to the incubation results without insulin - is set at 100%. The percentage data under "%lnSn,ax" are parts of the maximum stimulation factor defined In this way. The term ECgg indicates the concentration of the compound of the formula I at which 50% of the maximum stimulation to be achieved by the respective compound of the formula I is to be observed.<br>
B)      Glucose transport<br>
Rat fat cells in 100 pi of KRH buffer (titer 5x103 cells/ml) are incubated with gentle shaking at 37*C for 15 min with insulin or with the compound of the formula I according to the invention. After addition of 15 pi of 2-[3H]-deoxyglucose (0.3 mM, 0.2 pCi), the incubation is continued at room temperature. After specified times (0-20 min), 100 pi of the test batch are removed and transfen-ed to a reaction vessel (contents 400 pi), in which 250 pi of dinonyl phthalate have been initially introduced. After centrifugation (15,000 x g, 1 min), the cells are separated off from the oily layer of the incubation medium underneath the oily layer by cutting the tube at the level of<br><br>
the oily layer and transferrir 3.to a scintation vessel. After addition of 5 ml of water-soluble scintillation fluid, thu radioacl'Vity is determined. This total cell-associated radioactivity is corrected for [3H]- deoxyglucoss which has passively diffused into the cells and is included in iiie cell interstices by subtraction of a control value (incubation in the presence of the glucose transport inhibitor cytochalasin B)- The initial (stimulated) glucose transport rate is linear up to 15 min. The maximum stimulation factor - this is the ratio of the incubation result with insulin to the incubation result without  insulin -is set at 100%.<br>
