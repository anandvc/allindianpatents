				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an improved bath useful for providing corrosion resistant phosphate coating on metal surface at high temperature.<br>
The invention relates basically to the paint and wire industries and also short-term protection of ferrous items especially in prevention of corrosion of structural items, small components etc.<br>
Corrosion of metal is bound to take place which could be minimised to a very low level but cannot be checked completely. In order to mitigate the corrosion, different preventive measures namely metallic, inorganic, diffusion, organic coatings, etc. are in use. Out of these preventive measures, phosphate coating is considered to be ideal in many respects and used widely because of its versatility. It is extensively used as a base for paints and lubricants in wire drawing industries.<br>
In order to meet the need of the industries different phosphate formulations are available in the market. Hitherto known process uses Zinc Oxide which is costly chemical and sodium fluoride which is pollution prone substance. Other ingredients used are accelerators and activators.<br>
The known process consists of reacting Zinc Oxide with phosphoric and Nitric Acids. Other additives are accelerators and activators, such as Nitrates, Nitrites, Chlorats of Cu, Ni and the like and peroxide of Na, Hydrogenf and the like.<br><br>
It is generally observed that the known process takes longer time duration, 10 to 15 minutes at a temperature of 80 to 100° C to get desired coating weight and uses sodium fluoride, a pollution prone ingredient. It is based on two pack system and effective at less dilution (40 times dilution). It is comparatively costly as two pack handling and more concentrated bath increase cost. In the two pack conventional bath, sodium nitrite (oxidising agent) is added frequently to the bath to oxidise ferrous to ferric ions and for activation of sluggish bath.<br>
In view of the above facts, it is envisaged to develop a process for the production of Phosphate coating on metal surface by means o£ acid phosphate solutions for the purpose of producing improved resistance to corrosion, improved paint holding properties at a less time and decreased cost of production.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of an improved bath for phosphate coating on mild steel surface at higher temperature which obviates the above mentioned drawbacks. Another object is to develop an improved process for providing corrosion resistant phosphate coatings on metal surface.<br>
In the present invention, the solution for phosphate coating is produced by reacting ZnO and CaC03 with phosphoric acid and Nitric Acid. This is followed by incorporation of oxidizing agents and positive actions. Finally, another oxidising agent in the form of Nitrite is added to phosphating bath to regulate and accelerate phosphate coating formation. The value of the free<br><br>
acid and total acid are maintained at 1.5 and 15 points with respect to N/10 NaOH respectively to get desired phosphate coating. The selection of oxidising agents such as nitric acid, sodium nitrite, and the presence of heavy metal ions such as nickel and copper accelerates the reaction. The heavy metal ions and oxidising agents speed up the coating formation by increasing the active nucleation sites and depolarising the cathodic areas by removing hydrogen and this also increases the anodic reaction. Preparation of an aqueons solution consists of. 1.2% by v/v ortho-phosphoric acid and 0.25% v/v Nitric Acid, 0.4% wt/v Zinc Oxide and 0.1% wt/v calcium carbonate.<br>
The porosity in the phosphated steels are the channels through which corrosive agents like oxygen and water get access to the base metal. Surface pores on phosphate coatings are singularly responsible for the deterioration of protective property of coatings. The incorporation of Ca ions with Zn ions reduces the porosity and moisture permeability of the phosphate coatings on surfaces of steel.<br>
Another novelty of the present invention is that it is a single pack system giving desired coating within minutes.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of an improved bath useful for providing corrosion resistant phosphate coating on metal surface at high temperature which comprises :<br>
i)        preparing 30-40% v/v aqueous solution of. phosphoric acid ii)        adding heavy metal oxides such as ZnO, CaO, MgO, in the range of 20-25% w/v to the above aqueous solution under stirring till dissolution,<br><br>
iii)       adding  oxidising  agents selected from   Nitric acid,   H2O2,  sodium<br>
nitrates in the range of 10-15% w/v, iv)      adding  calcium carbonate, nickel carbonate,   copper  nitrate,   cobalt<br>
nitrate to the above mixture, in the range of 0.2 to 0.4% w/v, v)       adding   special oxidising agent such as sodium    nitrite (NaNO2) in small quantity to the above mixture intermitervtly in the range of 10-20% w/v.<br>
vi)      filtering the solution so prepared to get   clean solution, vii)      diluting the solution with water by around fifty   times its volume and<br>
heating the bath to a temperature in the range of 50 to 98°C by water. In  an embodiment of the present invention the total acid may be maintained in the range of 20 to 30 with respect to N/10 NaOH.<br>
In another embodiment the free acid maintained may be in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 with respect to N/10 HaOH.<br>
In yet another embodiment the temperature of the bath may be maintained at a temperature in the range of 70 to 80°C.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for providing corrosion resistant phosphate coatings on metal surfaces using the above valid bath which comprises:<br>
i)    dipping the material to be rendered corrosion resistant in the bath prepared as  herein  described     for     a  period  in  the  range  of  1   to   10  minutes.<br><br>
i. .1)        removing  the  phosphated samp IBB out of the  bath	and<br>

generation of heat on adding acids to ZnO/CaCO3 . Addition is<br>
made slowly while stirring. 60 gms of nickel carbonate and 10 gms<br>
of copper nitrate are then added in the above .mixture while<br>
stirring. Finally, 3 Kg.of sodium nitrite is added slowly. The<br>
total volume of these resultant solution is made up to 20 litres<br>
by water.<br>
A mild steel of size one sq.dm. was dipped in the prepared solution diluted to 50 times and heated to 70 - 80° C for one<br>
minute removed and washed with water.<br>

at one minute immersion in the solution.<br>
EXAMPLE - 2<br>
5	kg. of zinc oxide is treated with 8 litres of phosphoric<br>
(sp.gravity 1.71) and 2.5 litres of nitric acid (sp.gravity 1.40)<br>
at room temperature. Heat is generated on adding zinc oxide to<br>
the acid mixture. Addition is, therefore, done very slowly. 50<br>
gms of nickel carbonate and 8 gms of copper sulphate are then<br>
added in the above solution. Finally, 3 kg.of sodium nitrite is<br>
added slowly. The total volume of this resultant solution is made<br>
upto 20 litres by water.<br><br>
A mild steel of size one sq.dm was dipped in the prepared<br>
« '<br>
solution diluted to 50 times and heated to 70 - 80° C for 10 minutes dipping, removed and washed with water.<br>
RESULT:<br>
2 Phosphate coating on mild steel obtained is 2140 gms/ft2 at 10<br>
minutes immersion in the solution (diluted to 50 times) at 80 -<br>
90° C.<br>
EXAMPLE - 3<br>
5 Kg. of zinc oxide is treated with 9 litres of phophoric acid (sp.gravity 1.71) and 1.5 litres of nitric acid (sp.gravity 1.40) at room temperature. Heat is generated on adding zinc oxide to the acid mixture. Addition is, therefore, done slowly and while stirring. 60 gms of nickel nitrate and 10 gm of copper nitrate are then added in the above solution. Finally, 2 kg. of sodium nit rile is added in the above solution. The total volume of this resultant solution is made upto 20 litres.<br>
A mild steel of size one sq. dm. was dipped in the prepared solution diluted to 50 times and heated to 70 - 80°C for 5 minutes dipping removed and washed with water.<br>
RESULTS;<br>
The phosphate coating obtained on mild steel is 1000 gm/ft2 at 5<br>
minutes immersion in the solution (diluted to 50 times) at 70-<br>
80 °C<br>

2.	In the process of present invention, the cost is reduced to 25% in<br>
comparison to the existing process by using cheaper chemicals.<br>
3.	In the present invention, the concentrate is diluted to 50 times whereas in<br>
