COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
{See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
   FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS IN THE FORM OF AQUEOVS EMULSION<br><br>
HINDUSTAN    LEVER    LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/101724<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003992<br><br>
FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions.  More specifically, the present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions comprising specific nonionic surfactants which provide excellent high temperature stability.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Fabric treatment compositions for treatment of fabrics during a laundry operation are well known.  They are typically divided into the classes of domestic or industrial compositions, main-wash or rinse cycle compositions and cleaning or conditioning/softening compositions.<br>
Fabric conditioning compositions typically comprise a fabric conditioning agent, such as a fabric softening material, at a level of about 1 to less than about 10% by weight in which case the composition is considered to be dilute or semi-concentrated, or from more than about 10 to about 30% by weight, in which case the composition is considered to be concentrated.<br>
It has hitherto been known that so-called concentrated compositions are particularly prone to instability, such as phase-separation, flocculation, gelling, pearlescence etc, upon storage,<br><br>
WO 2004/101724<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003992<br><br>
At elevated temperature storage, instability often manifests itself as pearlescence or as an irreversible thickening of the composition to the point that it may no longer be pourable. This is clearly undesirable to consumers.<br>
It was generally considered that such problems did not exist for so-called dilute compositions.<br>
In particular, it was conventional understood and believed that the level of components typically known to induce instability, such as perfumes, nonionic surfactants and quaternary ammonium fabric softening materials, was sufficiently low that their destabilising influence was negligible.<br>
Storage stability at elevated temperatures has previously been addressed in various ways.  WO-A1-99/50378 discloses a fabric softening agent comprising from 1 to 8% of a quaternary ammonium fabric conditioning compound, a stabilising agent and a fatty alcohol.  The stabilising agent is preferably a primary or secondary alkoxylated alcohol comprising 10 or more moles of alkylene oxide.<br>
The present inventors have found that, while stability upon storage at an elevated temperature of 37°C is desirable, it can be achieved, for dilute compositions at least, without significant difficulty.  However, stability at even higher temperatures, e.g. 41 C or 45 C or even 50 C, as can be experienced for extended periods in certain environments, is disproportionately more difficult to achieve.<br>
This problem is exacerbated when the composition comprises an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening<br><br>
WO 2004/101724<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/003992<br><br>
material and is further complicated when the material has one or more fully saturated alkyl chains.<br>
However, it is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due to their inherent biodegradability and to use substantially fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and because they are more stable to oxidative degradation (which can lead to malodour generation) than partially saturated or fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br>
Of the types of ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamine which produce at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked component since the raw material has a low melting temperature which enables the manufacturing process of the composition to occur at low temperatures.  This reduces difficulties associated with high temperature handling, transport and processing of the raw material and compositions produced therefrom.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems, and/or to give one or more of the above-mentioned benefits desired by consumers.<br>

The compositions may also contain one or more optional ingredients conventionally included in fabric conditioning compositions such as pH buffering agents, perfume carriers, fluorescers, colourants, hydrotropes, antifoaming agents, antiredeposition agents, polyelectrolytes, enzymes, optical brightening agents, anti-shrinking agents, anti-wrinkle agents, anti-spotting agents, antioxidants, sunscreens, anti-corrosion agents, drape imparting agents, anti-static agents, anti-mould agents, ironing aids and dyes.<br><br>

Product Form<br>
At ambient temperature, the product comprises a liquid, more preferably an aqueous liquid, most preferably an aqueous dispersion of the quaternary ammonium softening material.<br>
Product Use<br>
The composition is preferably used in the rinse cycle of a home textile laundering operation, where, it may be added directly in an undiluted state to a washing machine, e.g. through a dispenser drawer or, for a top-loading washing machine, directly into the drum.  Alternatively, it can be diluted prior to use.  The compositions may also be used in a domestic hand-washing laundry operation.<br>
It is also possible, though less desirable, for the  —-compositions of the present invention to be used in industrial laundry operations, e.g. as a finishing agent for softening new clothes prior to sale to consumers.<br>
Preparation<br>
The compositions of the invention may be prepared according to any suitable method.<br>
In a first preferred method, the quaternary ammonium material, nonionic material and perfume are heated together until a co-melt is formed.  Water is then heated and the co-melt is added to water with stirring.  The mixture is then allowed to cool.  In an alternative method, the perfume can<br><br>
WO 2004/101724<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/003992<br><br>
be added to the mixture after the co-melt is formed, e.g. at any time during the cooling stage.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.  Further modifications will be apparent to the person skilled in the art.<br>
All values are % by weight of the active ingredient unless stated otherwise.<br>
Samples A to J were prepared in a standard 31 rig with a Janke Kunkel mill using the following process:<br>
The DEQA, fatty alcohol and nonionic material (if present) were co-melted and then added to water at 65 °C over 2 minutes with agitation {200 rpm).  Mixing was continued for a further 10 minutes and then preservative and dye added. The resulting mixture was removed from heat and perfume added with mixing and over 5 minutes during cooling.  The polymer was then added.<br>

Example 1; viscosity evaluation<br>
Viscosity was measured upon storage at various temperatures. Measurements were made at 106s~ at ambient temperature using a Haake Rotoviscometer RV20 NV Bob and Cup.<br>
Sample A was stored at 37°C, 41°C, 45°C and 50°C. Viscosity data is given in the following table:<br><br>

The results demonstrate that storage stability was<br>
particularly problematic at very high temperatures.<br>
Samples B to M were stored at 45°C and 50°C.  The viscosity results are given in the following table.  In the following tables, "G" denotes gelled, "P" denotes pearlesced, "PS" denotes phase separation, "F" denotes flocculated, and "S" denotes solid.<br>
