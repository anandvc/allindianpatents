				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an insulated device for   fixing Rail on concrete sleeper .<br>
In the prior art, a malleable cast iron(MCI) steel insert with a hole therein is grouted on to a concrete sleeper,through the said hole is inserted an elastic rail clip which sits on a steel liner or a glass filled nylon liner placed in between the elastic rail clip and rail foot for fixing the rail on the concrete sleeper. In general, steel liners are used, whereas in track circuited area glass filled nylon liners are used. The steel liner does not provide electrical insulation and is prone to surface corrosion and thereby gets slackened and thus has a tendency to slip out of the rail foot. The glass filled nylon liner provides the necessary electrical insulation but is not suitable for repeated use , that is, once it is removed from the track area it cannot be reused again and had to be replaced as the surface of the glass filled nylon liner on which the elastic rail clip sits gets indented due to the constant pressure exerted by the elastic rai1 clip. Additionally, since glass filled nylon liners are brittle in nature hence it has a tendency to crack through usage.<br>
In the present invention the said conventional liners are being replaced by insulated liners made of steel moulded with polymer. This insulated liner ensures complete electrical insulation of the sleeper from the rail and is also corrosion free and can be put to repeated use.<br>
The insulated liner made of steel moulded with polymer, will also protect  the steel liner  from corrosion. Furthermore,  composite<br>
2<br><br>
construction of the insulated liner, i.e steel with polymer, gives extra strength in comparison to the glass filled nylon liner and so can be put to repetative use. The polymer moulded insulated liner will also eliminate stress corrosion.       <br>
According to the present invention there is provided : An insulated device for fixing rails on concrete sleeper comprising a MCI insert with a hole therein is grouted in the concrete sleeper, an elastic rail clip, a groove rubber pad, as cushion, in between rail and concrete sleeper and an insulated liner which is pressed against the rail foot by the elastic rail clip inserted in the hole is characterised in that the insulated liner is a steel liner moulded with polymer providing complete electrical insulation to the rail wherein projections and surface edge moulded with polymer of the said insulated liner, sits across the MCI insert thereby preventing lateral displacement  of<br>
said insulated liner.<br><br>
The  invention is now described in detail with reference  to  the<br>
accompanying  drawings  where  like  reference  numerals   always<br><br>
indicate the same parts throughout the description of the drawings in which:<br>
Fig.l  shows the general view of the insulated steel liner.<br>
Fig.2   shows the insulated liner along the section line  X-Y  of<br>
fig.l.<br>
Fig.3 shows the insulated liner along the section line X-Y of fig.l, showing an alternative embodiment of the present invention<br>
3<br><br>
wherein all the surface of the insulated liner is  moulded with<br>
polymer.<br>
Fig.4   shows an insulated device for  fixing rails  on  concrete<br>
sleeper.<br>
By the present invention, an insulated device for fixing rails on concrete sleeper consists of a concrete sleeper (6) on which rail (13) is laid with a grooved rubber pad(12) in between rail and concrete sleeper for providing cushion between rail and concrete sleeper, a MCI insert (3) with a hole (7) therein is grouted on to the concrete sleeper (6), an elastic rail clip (2) which is inserted into the hole (7) of the MCI insert (3), and an insulated liner (1). One side of the said elastic rail clip is inserted in the hole (7) of the MCI insert (3) and other side of the elastic rail clip presses onto the upper surface of the insulated liner (1) which is placed on the rail foot and thereby holds the rail in its position on the concrete sleeper. The shape of the elastic rail clip is such that the elastic rail clip creates a constant spring pressure onto the insulated liner (1) and thereby keeps the insulated liner pressed onto the rail and holds the rail in its position. The profile of the insulated liner is such that it has required projections (8), (9) and (14), as shown in Fig 1 is moulded with polymer so that the insulated liner when placed inbetween the MCI insert and rail foot, as shown in Fig.4, the dimension of the surface edge (10) of the insulated liner matches with the MCI insert and the edges (8), (9) and (14) of the insulated liner sits on the steel insert thereby preventing the insulated liner from lateral displacement.<br>
4<br><br>
The gradient of the under-surface, moulded with polymer, of the insulated liner is such that it matches with the profile of the rail foot.<br>
The insulated liner is made of steel liner moulded with polymer at the under-surface and all the side surfaces except the top surface(11), i.e. the surface on which elastic rail clip sits. The insulated liner provides electrical insulation between the rail and the steel insert and in-turn with the concrete sleeper.<br>
The insulated steel liner moulded with polymer also protects the steel liner from corrosion in addition to the electrical insulation of the rail.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, referring to fig3, the insulated steel liner is moulded with polymer on all its surfaces of the liner. Here the top surface(ll) is also moulded with polymer. This type of insulated steel liner is mainly used in areas where steel liner is more prone to atmospheric corrosion .<br>
The under surface of the insulated liner 1 is tapered to suit the profile of the rai1 foot for perfect holding and suitable to maintain the toe load .<br>
The present invented insulated liner (1) is a replacement of the existing steel liner and glass filled nylon liner. The insulated liner 1 sits into the gap between the rail and the malleable cast iron insert grouted into the concrete sleeper. The insulated liner provides electrical insulation, corrosion resistance and can be put to repeated use.<br>
