SPINNING MACHINE<br>
 ACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a spinning machine, and in particular, to a spinning machine provided with a fiber bundle concentrating apparatus which applies a suction force to fiber bundle that has been drafted by a draft part in the spinning machine and concentrates the fiber bundle on the downstream side of the final delivery roller pair of the above described draft part.<br>
Spinning machines provided with the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus of this type apply a suction force to fiber bundle that has been drafted and concentrate the fiber bundle in advance before twisting so that an increase in the quality of the threads, including a reduction in fuzzing, is achieved. The quality of the threads is affected by the magnitude of suction pressure that applies through suction holes (suction slits) a suction force to fiber bundle that has been drafted by a draft part, and therefore, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate suction pressure.<br>
Conventional spinning machines which allow suction pressure of a fiber bundle concentrating apparatus to be set and varied in order for the quality of the spun threads to meet desired conditions have been proposed (see, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-100092). In the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus equipped in the spinning machine of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004^100092, a plurality of ducts are provided along the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine. A suction device in which a fan is driven by a motor is connected to each duct with a pipe. In addition, a suction pipe, which is a suction part, is attached to each duct with a connection<br><br>
tube. Each suction pipe is provided for a plurality of spindles in such a state as to extend parallel to the ducts. The motors are connected to a common inverter so that the inverter controls the motors on the basis of a command signal from a controller. The controller outputs a rotation speed command for the motors, which corresponds to the conditions for spinning threads, to the inverter.<br>
In addition, in the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-100092, the plurality of ducts are each maintained at a negative pressure by means of a suction device. Accordingly, even when some suction devices are stopped due to an abnormality, the application of a suction force through suction holes is ensured by the negative pressure generated by the remaining suction devices, and thus, the quality of the threads is maintained within an allowable range.<br>
When threads are spun out by a spinning machine provided with the above described fiber bundle concentrating apparatus, the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus sucks a large amount of fiber waste through the suction pressure applied through the suction slits. Then, the fiber waste deposits and clogs, which causes a suction device to function abnormally. In this case, the suction device will be damaged if the operation is continued, and therefore, it is necessary to immediately stop the suction device. In conventional spinning machines, motors which are respectively provided in a plurality of suction devices are controlled by one inverter, and therefore, when the inverter is suddenly stopped in an emergency, the motors of the normal suction devices are also suddenly stopped, causing the threads to be cut. Therefore, the task of connecting many threads becomes necessary at the time of restarting the operation, and thus, there is a problem that the number of manufacturing steps increases.<br><br>
Meanwhile, in the case where the motors for the plurality of suction devices are respectively driven by separate inverters and some suction devices are caused to function abnormally, the operation of the spinning machine can be continued without stopping the motors other than those of the abnormally functioning suction devices. However, the cost is high because a plurality of inverters are provided.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a spinning machine that is divided into a plurality of blocks and has a fiber bundle concentrating apparatus, the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus having suction devices each of which is provided for one of the blocks and has a motor. The motors are driven by a common inverter. It is another objective to, at the time of an abnormality in the spinning machine, to prevent threads from being cut in normal blocks.<br>
To achieve the foregoing objective and in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a spinning machine having a fiber bundle concentrating apparatus for concentrating fiber bundle which is drafted by a draft part is provided. The fiber bundle concentrating apparatus is formed of a plurality of blocks. Each block includes a delivery portion, a suction portion, and a suction apparatus. The delivery portion has a nip roller and a ventilation member. The suction portion has a suction hole which is provided at least on the upstream side of the nip point of the delivery portion in the direction in which the fiber bundle moves. The ventilation member rotates along the suction portion. The suction apparatus is capable of changing a suction pressure applied to the suction portion. The suction apparatus includes a duct, to which the suction<br><br>
portion is connected with a connection tube, and a suction device, which is provided in the duct in order to make the pressure inside the duct negative and has a motor. The motors of the blocks are electrically connected to a common inverter and controlled by a controller through the inverter. The spinning machine has a contactor, an abnormality detecting section, and at least one contactor control portion. The contactor is provided in each block for electrically connecting the corresponding motor to the inverter. The abnormality detecting section is provided in each block for detecting an abnoirmality that leads to an excessive load on the corresponding motor. The at least one contactor control portion is provided for switching the contactor in the block where there is the abnormality to a non-contact state on the basis of an abnormality detection signal from the abnormality detecting section.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following, one embodiment according to the present invention is described in reference to Figs, 1 to 4. A fine spinning machine is described as an example of the spinning machine according to the present embodiment.<br>
The fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 in the fine spinning machine according to the present embodiment basically has the same configuration as the apparatus in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-100092, excluding the suction apparatuses and the configuration for controlling the motors of the suction apparatuses. As shown in Fig. 2, a draft device 11, which is a draft part, is of a 3-line type which is provided with a front bottom roller 12, a middle bottom roller 13, and a back bottom roller 14. The front bottom roller 12 is supported in a predetermined location in a roller stand 15, and the middle and back bottom rollers 13 and 14 are supported with support brackets 13a and 14a, which are secured in such a manner that the locations of these can be adjusted relative to the roller stand 15. A bottom apron 16 is wound around a bottom tenser 17 and the middle bottom roller 13.<br>
A front top roller 19, a middle top roller 20, and a back top roller 21 are respectively supported by a weighting arm 18 with support members and positioned so as to face the front bottom roller 12, the middle bottom roller 13 and the back bottom roller 14, respectively- A set of these top rollers 19 to 21 is provided per two spindles. The front bottom roller 12 and the front top roller 19 form the final<br><br>
delivery roller pair in the draft device 11.<br>
The fine spinning machine is provided with the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30, which is placed on the downstream side of the final delivery roller pair in the draft device 11. The fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 is provided with suction pipes 32 and 33, which form a delivery portion 31 and a suction portion S, and a ventilation apron 34, which is a ventilation member. The delivery portion 31 includes a bottom nip roller 35a, which is a nip roller formed around a rotary shaft 35 which is provided parallel to the front bottom roller 12, and a top nip roller 31a, which is a nip roller pressed by the bottom nip roller 35a with a ventilation apron 34.<br>
The top nip roller 31a is supported by the weighting arm 18 with a support member 36 per two spindles in the same manner as the sets of top rollers 19 to 21. In this embodiment, the support member 36 is integrally formed with the support member for the front top roller 19.<br>
The draft device 11 has roller stands 15 which are provided at predetermined intervals in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine- The portion on the bottom side of the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 is formed of units, each having spindles of which the number is half of those placed between adjacent roller stands 15, that is to say, four spindles in this embodiment, A support arm (not shown), of which the proximal portion is supported by a support beam 37 extending in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine (direction perpendicular to the surface of the paper of Fig. 2),   is provided in the midway between the roller stand 15 and an adjacent roller stand 15 so that a rotary shaft 35 is rotatably supported between the roller stand 15 and the support arm.<br><br>
A gear (not shown) is provided at the center of the rotary shaft 35 in the longitudinal direction so as to be integrally rotatable with the rotary shaft 35. The front bottom roller 12 has a gear portion 12a in the location facing the gear of the rotary shaft 35. In addition, a middle gear 43 which engages with the gear portion 12a and the gear on the rotary shaft 35 is rotatably supported by a support arm 42 of which the proximal portion is secured to the support beam 37 in the same manner as in the above described support arm which supports the rotary shaft 35. That is to say, the rotating force of the front bottom roller 12 is transmitted to the rotary shaft 35 through the gear portion 12a, the middle gear 43, and the gear on the rotary shaft 35.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, ducts 44 for the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 are provided in the fine spinning machine so as to extend in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine. As shown in Fig. 1, a plurality of ducts 44 are provided in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine so as to be located between columns of spindles on both sides of the ducts 44. Each duct 44 has a length which corresponds to eight spindles in a column on one side, that is to say, sixteen spindles in columns on both sides. A suction device 45 for making the pressure inside each duct 44 negative is connected to the duct 44 via a pipe 46. The fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 includes a plurality of blocks (units), each of which corresponds to sixteen spindles, and a duct 44 and a suction device 45 are provided in each block (unit).<br>
The suction device 45 includes a fan 47a and a motor 47 for rotating the fan 47a. As shown in Fig. 2, the duct 44 is provided at the center of the width direction of the fine spinning machine above the rear portion of the draft device<br><br>
11, and the suction device 4 5 is provided below the duct 44. The duct 44 and the suction device 45 form a suction apparatus-<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, each suction portion S is provided per four spindles in such a state as to extend parallel to the ducts 44, and four suction portions S are respectively connected to one duct 44 by connection tubes 48. The connection tubes 48 are provided with a bellow portion 49 (shown only in Fig. 2) at the middle in the longitudinal direction of the connection tube 48. In Fig. 1, two suction pipes 32 and 33 are shown collectively as a suction portion S, and the below described suction holes 32a and 33a (see Fig. 3) which are created in the two suction pipes 32 and 33, respectively, are shown collectively as one broken line circle.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the suction pipe 32 and the suction pipe 33 are provided so as to be located on the upstream side and on the downstream side from the nip point of the bottom nip roller 35a in the direction in which the fiber bundle (fleece) F moves, respectively. The suction pipe 32 has a sliding surface against which the ventilation apron 34 can slide, and a suction hole 32a in slit form which extends from the nip point of the bottom nip roller 35a toward the upstream side in the direction in which the fiber bundle F moves is created in this sliding surface. The suction pipe 33 has a sliding surface against which the ventilation apron 34 can slide, and a suction hole 33a in slit form which extends from the nip point of the bottom nip roller 35a toward the downstream side is created in this sliding surface.<br>
The suction pipe 32 is formed in such a shape as to be able to guide the ventilation apron 34 to the vicinity of the nip point between the front bottom roller 12 and the front<br><br>
top roller 19. The ventilation apron 34 is wound around the suction pipes 32 and 33 and the bottom nip roller 35a in such a manner that a portion thereof makes contact with the suction pipes 32 and 33 and another portion makes contact with the bottom nip roller 35a, so as to rotate while sliding against the sliding surface of the suction pipes 32 and 33 together with the rotation of the bottom nip roller 35a. The ventilation apron 34 is formed of woven cloth which ensures appropriate ventilation.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the distal end of the suction nozzle 50 of a single type pneumatic device, which operates to draw fiber bundle F which is fed out from the draft device 11 when the thread is cut, is provided below the suction pipe 33. The proximal end of the suction nozzle 50 is connected to the pneumatic duct 51, which is shared by all of the spindles,<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, one inverter 53 which is connected to the commercial alternating power supply 52 is provided in the fine spinning machine. Each motor 47 is electrically connected to the common inverter 53 via the corresponding contactor (electromagnetic contactor) 54. Each contactor 54 is electrically connected to a contactor control portion 55 and controlled so as to open and close on the basis of a command signal outputted from the contactor control portion 55.<br>
Each block of the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 is provided with a pressure sensor 56 for detecting pressure (negative pressure) which corresponds to the suction pressure of the suction portion S. "Pressure which corresponds to the suction pressure of the suction portion S" means that the pressure detected by the pressure sensor 56 is not limited to the pressure of the suction portion S (that is<br><br>
to say, the pressure detected by the pressure sensor 56, which is in such a state as to be connected to the suction portion S), and includes the pressure in portions other than the suction portion S, which makes it possible to obtain (calculate) the pressure in the suction portion S, Each pressure sensor 56 is provided in such a location as to be able to detect the pressure of the pipe 46, for example. Each pressure sensor 56 outputs the voltage in accordance with the detected pressure. Each pressure sensor 56 forms a detection portion for detecting a physical quantity which is associated to an excessive load on the motor 47.<br>
Each contactor control portion 55 is formed of a microcomputer and provided so as to correspond to each motor 47. Each contactor control portion 55 receives the output signal of the pressure sensor 56 via an A/D conversion circuit and calculates the pressure from this output signal. Each contactor control portion 55 compares the calculated pressure with a reference value that has been stored in a memory in advance so as to determine whether there are any abnormalities. When it is deteinnined that there is an abnormality, the contactor control portion 55 outputs an open command signal to the contactor 54 so that the contactor 54 is switched to a non-contact state. The contactor control portion 55 forms a determination section for determining whether there are any abnormalities by comparing a physical quantity which can lead to an excessive load on the motor 47 with a reference value for determining whether there are any abnormalities which has been set in accordance with the conditions for spinning. The contactor control portion 55 and the pressure sensor 56 form an abnormality detecting section for detecting abnormalities which can lead to an excessive load on the motor 47.<br>
In the case where the contactor control portion 55<br><br>
determines whether there are abnormalities through the pressure detected by the pressure sensor 56, the pressure detected by the pressure sensor 56 may vary greatly depending on which side of the portion in which the pressure sensor 56 is installed in the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30, that is a side corresponding to the suction portion S or a side corresponding to the suction device 45 side, fiber waste clogs the path. Therefore, two (a pair of) reference values are used for an appropriate suction pressure instead of one value. In addition, it is determined that there is an abnormality when the absolute value of the detected pressure is equal to or greater than the greater reference value or equal to or smaller than the smaller reference value. The above described reference values are changed in accordance with the conditions for spinning. The contactor control portion 55 receives the reference value corresponding to the conditions for spinning from the controller 57 for controlling the operation of the fine spinning machine.<br>
The inverter 53 incorporates a converter circuit and an inverter circuit so that the alternating current from the alternating power supply 52 is first converted to a direct current by means of the converter circuit, next converted to an alternating current having a desired frequency and voltage by means of the inverter circuit, and then outputted. The inverter 53 is electrically connected to the controller 57 and each motor 47 is controlled on the basis of a command signal from the controller 57.<br>
The controller 57 is provided with a CPU 58, a memory 59, an input device 60, and a display 61, The controller 57 can communicate with the inverter 53 and each contactor control portion 55 via a serial interface. The memory 59 stores data on the appropriate suction pressure to be applied to the fiber bundle F corresponding to the spinning<br><br>
conditions in terms of the various types of fiber and the number of the spun threads, as well as data on the rotation speed of the motors 47 corresponding to the appropriate suction pressure. In addition, the memory 59 stores a map or an operation formula so that, in accordance with the appropriate suction pressure, the contactor control portion 55 sets a reference value used for determining whether there are any abnormalities.<br>
The controller 57 (CPU 58) controls each motor 47 through the inverter 53 so that the corresponding suction device 45 generates appropriate suction pressure in accordance with the conditions for spinning that have been inputted through the input device 60, The controller 57 receives pressure data on each block through the corresponding contactor control portion 55 and carries out feedback control on the corresponding motor 47. In addition, when the conditions for spinning are changed and the appropriate suction pressure is changed, the controller 57 outputs to the corresponding contactor control portion 55 a reference value which corresponds to the suction pressure change and is used for determining whether there are any abnormalities -<br>
The controller 57 displays pressure data on each block that has been inputted through the corresponding contactor control portion 55 on the display 61. The displayed pressure data includes a value gained by converting the detected pressure to the pressure in the suction portion S instead of the value of the pressure detected by the pressure sensors 56. The displayed pressure data includes the pressure value of each block at that point in time, the average pressure value of each block during a predetermined period (for example 10 minutes) up to that point in time, the average pressure value of all of the blocks at that point in time, and the average<br><br>
pressure value of all of the blocks during the predetermined period of time.<br>
The controller 57 receives pressure information on each block through the corresponding contactor control portion 55. -When the controller 57 receives an abnormality detection signal through any of the contactor control portions 55, the operation of the fine spinning machine is suspended and abnormality information is displayed on the display 61. The abnormality information includes information on, for example, the location or the number of the blocks which have been determined to be abnormal and whether the location where there is an abnormality in the pressure is on the side corresponding to the suction portion S or the motor 47 of the location in which the pressure sensor 56 is installed in the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30.<br>
Next, the operations of the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 formed as described above are described.<br>
Prior to the operation of the fine spinning machine, the spinning conditions, for example the type of fibers and the number of spun threads, are inputted into the controller 57 through the input device 60. The controller 57 sets an appropriate suction pressure in accordance with the conditions for spinning when the conditions for spinning are inputted, and sets the reference value for determining whether there are any abnormalities corresponding to this suction pressure, and at the same time, outputs the reference value to the contactor control portion 55.<br>
The controller 57 controls the draft device 11, the spindle driving system, the ring rail lifting system, and the motors 47 in accordance with the conditions for spinning, and thus operates the fine spinning machine. When the fine<br><br>
spinning machine is operated, the fiber bundle F passes between the bottom rollers 12 to 14 and the top rollers 19 to 21 in the draft device 11 so as to be drafted, and after that, is guided to the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30, The delivery portion 31 rotates slightly faster than the surface speed of the front bottom roller 12 and the front top roller 19, so that the fiber bundle F passes through the nip point of the delivery portion 31 in an appropriately tense state, and after that, turns in a different direction and moves toward the downstream side while being twisted. Then, the fiber bundle is wound around a bobbin which is mounted in the spindle as a spun thread-<br>
The controller 57 controls the rotation speed of the motors 47 via the inverter 53 so that the negative pressure within the ducts 44 becomes of a state which corresponds to the appropriate suction pressure. The suction of the ducts 44 reaches the suction pipes 32 and 33 via the connection tubes 48, and the suction of the suction holes 32a and 33a created in the sliding surfaces reaches the fiber bundle F via the ventilation apron 34. Then, the fiber bundle F moves in such ci state as  to be concentrated through suction in the location corresponding to the suction holes 32a and 33a- Accordingly, the fine spinning machine according to the present embodiment suppresses fuzzing and waste cotton, and thus, improves the quality of the spun thread in comparison with fine spinning machines which are not equipped with the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30.<br>
The contactor control portion 55 stores the reference value outputted from the controller 57 in the memory and determines whether there are any abnormalities on  the basis of this reference value. The contactor control portion 55 receives the detection signal from the pressure sensors 56 during the operation of the fine spinning machine and<br><br>
calculates the pressure corresponding to the suction pressure in the suction portions S from this detection signal. The contactor control portion 55 outputs the pressure data to the controller 51,   and at the same time compares it with the reference value in order to determine whether there are any abnormalities. In the case where the contactor control portion 55 has determined that there is an abnormality, it immediately outputs an open command signal to the contactor 54 on the basis of this detection signal. As a result, the contactor 54 is switched to a non-contact state and the current supply to the motor 47 connected to this contactor 54 is stopped, and thus, the motor 47 is immediately stopped. Accordingly, the motor 47 is prevented from continuing to operate in an overloaded state and the suction device 45 is prevented from being damaged. When the motor 47 stops, the suction of the suction portion S which is connected to the duct 44 corresponding to this motor 47 disappears. This likely to cause thread cutting. However, since the inverter 53 continues the control in a normal state, the motors 47 of blocks other than the block where there is an abnormality do not stop for emergency, and therefore, the thread can be prevented from being cut.<br>
The controller 57 carries out feedback control on the motors 47 in accordance with the pressure data outputted from the respective contactor control portions 55 during the operation of the fine spinning machine. The controller 57, for example, calculates the average value of the pressure data on the plurality of blocks and outputs a command signal to the inverter 53 so that this average value falls in a predetermined range.<br>
When an abnormality detection signal is outputted from a contactor control portion 55, the controller 57 suspends the operation of the fine spinning machine. Concretely, the<br><br>
controller 57 stops the fine spinning machine in a state where the spindle driving system, the ring rail lifting system, and the draft device 11 are in synchronization, so that winding of the spun thread is stopped in such a state that the thread is unlikely to be cut at the time of restart. When the fine spinning machine is stopped, a worker puts the fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 in a state where no roving is supplied to the respective spindles of the block where there is an abnormality. Concretely, the worker cuts the roving of the roving bobbin in the upstream of the trumpet of the draft device 11. Next, the fine spinning machine is restarted and the thread is wound until a predetermined point (for example, full bobbin) in time at which doffing is carried out. Then, after the work of removing fiber waste which clogs the block where there is an abnormality is carried out after doffing, the fine spinning machine is restarted. The motors 47 may be stopped at the time of the operation for doffing, or may be driven continuously. In the case where they are stopped, the motors 47 start after the suction pressure in the suction portion S has reached a set pressure after the restart of the fine spinning machine.<br>
If the motors 47 of all of the blocks are stopped for emergency when there is an abnormality, threads are likely to be cut even in the spindles provided in blocks other than the abnormal block. According to the present embodiment, only the motor 47 in the block where there is an abnormality is stopped for emergency when there is an abnormality, and therefore, the threads are prevented from being cut in the spindles provided in blocks other than the abnormal block.<br>
According to this embodiment, the following advantages can be gained.<br><br>
(1)	The fiber bundle concentrating apparatus 30 is formed of a plurality of blocks, and each block is provided with- a suction apparatus including a duct 4 4 to which the suction portions S are connected via a connection tube 48 and a suction device 45 for generating negative pressure within the duct 44* The motors 47 of the suction devices 45 are electrically connected to the common inverter 53 through the contactors 54 and controlled by the controller 57 through the inverter 53. Accordingly, even in the case of a great number of spindles (for example 800 to 1000 spindles), the suction pressure of each suction portion S is easily adjusted to an appropriate suction pressure-<br>
(2)	Each block is provided with an abnormality detecting section formed of a detection portion for detecting the physical quantity that leads to an excessive load on the motor 47 (pressure sensor 56 in this embodiment) and a determination section for determining whether there are any abnormalities on the basis of the detection signal of the detection portion (contactor control portion 55). Each block is provided with a contactor control portion 55 for switching the corresponding contactor 54 to a non-contact state on the basis of the abnormality detection signal from the abnormality detecting section. Accordingly, in the configuration of the present embodiment, threads are prevented from being cut in normal blocks even when the motor 47 of an abnormal block is stopped when there is an abnormality, unlike in conventional apparatuses-<br>
(3)	One inverter 53 controls all of the motors 47. Therefore, the configuration becomes simple in comparison with configurations where a plurality of inverters 53 are used, and thus, the cost is reduced.<br>
(4)	The pressure sensors 56 for detecting the pressure<br><br>
which corresponds to the suction pressure of the suction portions S are used as detection portions for accurately detecting the physical quantity that leads to an excessive load on the motors 47. Accordingly, the detection signal from the abnormality detecting section can be used to determine whether the suction pressure of the suction portions S which affects the quality of the threads is an appropriate pressure in accordance with the conditions for spinning.<br>
(5)	The controller 57 suspends the operation of the fine spinning machine when an abnormality detection signal is inputted through the contactor control portion 55. Then, the supply of roving to each spindle from the block which corresponds to the motor 47 that has been stopped due to an abnormality is stopped. After that, the fine spinning machine is restarted so that the thread is wound until the bobbin is full. Accordingly, roving can be prevented from being used wastefully in the spindles of the block where there is an abnormality, as opposed to spinning machines which continue operating to wind the thread until the bobbin becomes full without stopping the spinning machine.<br>
(6)	The controller 57 sets an appropriate suction pressure in accordance with the conditions for spinning that have been inputted by the input device 60, and when the appropriate suction pressure is changed following the change in the conditions, the controller 57 outputs to each contactor control portion 55 a reference value which corresponds to the suction pressure change and is used for determining whether there are any abnormalities for spinning. Then, the contactor control portion 55 determines whether there are any abnormalities in each block using this reference value. That is to say, even when the appropriate suction pressure is changed following the change in the conditions for spinning, the reference value for determining<br><br>
whether there are any abnormalities is automatically changed. Accordingly/ it can be determined whether there are any abnormalities in the pressure more strictly, so that the quality of the thread is not adversely affected.<br>
(7)	The controller 57 is provided with a display 61, and the suction pressure data on the suction portions S is displayed on the display 61. The display includes the value for the suction pressure of the suction portion S in each block at that point in time, the average value for the pressure in each suction portion S during a predetermined period of time (for example 10 minutes) up to that point in time, the average value for the pressure for all of the blocks at that point in time, the average value for the pressure during a predetermined period of time for all of the blocks and the like in a certain format. Accordingly, the value for the suction pressure in each block or suction portion S can be confirmed easily.<br>
(8)	The controller 57 is provided with the display 61, and displays the abnormal block on the display 61 when an abnormality detection signal is inputted through a contactor control portion 55. Accordingly, an worker or a manager can easily find blocks where there is an abnormality.<br>
(9)	The pressure sensors 56 are provided midway between the suction portions S and the suction devices 45. Therefore, when a portion on the side corresponding to the suction portion S of the portion where the pressure sensor 56 is installed is clogged, the absolute value of the pressure detected by the pressure sensor 56 becomes" greater than that detected at the time of normal operation. When a portion on the side corresponding to the suction device 45 of the portion where the pressure sensor 56 is installed is clogged, the absolute value for the pressure detected by the pressure<br><br>
sensor 56 becomes smaller than that detected at the time of normal operation. The controller 57 receives pressure data detected by the pressure sensors 56 through the contactor control portions 55, and therefore, can determine whether a suction portion S or a suction device 45 is clogged with fiber waste on the basis of the pressure data made when an abnormality detection signal is inputted through a contactor control portion 55. The portion which has been determined to be clogged with fiber waste is displayed on the display 61,<br>
It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.  Particularly, it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in the following forms.<br>
The controller 57 may continue the operation of the fine spinning machine until doffing without suspending the operation of the fine spinning machine, even when an abnormality detection signal is inputted through a contactor control portion 55. Then, the controller 57 may restart the fine spinning machine, after the task of removing clogging of fiber waste from the block where there is an abnormality has been carried out. In this case, operation is not stopped. Therefore, although roving is used wastefully in blocks where there is an abnormality, the efficiency in the operation of the fine spinning machine becomes high.<br>
Instead of the contactor control portions 55 being provided in respective blocks, detection signals from the respective pressure sensors 56 may be inputted into the controller 57 through an A/D converter, and thus, whether there are any abnormalities in the respective blocks may be determined in the controller 57. In this case, it is not necessary to provide a contactor control portion 55 in each<br><br>
block, and therefore, it is not necessary to transmit 5 signal between the contactor control portions 55 and the controller 57, and thus, the configuration and control become simple.<br>
Instead of determining whether there are any abnormalities by comparing the detection signal of the pressure sensors 56 with the reference value after the detection signal is converted to the suction pressure of the suction portions S through calculation, whether there are any abnormalities may be determined by comparing the value detected by the pressure sensors 56 with a corresponding reference value without converting the value to the suction pressure of the suction portions S through calculation.<br>
Abnormality detection portions for detecting abnormalities that lead to an excessive load on the motors 47 may be modified as long as they are provided with a detection portion for detecting the physical quantity that leads to an excessive load on the motor 47 and a determination section for determining whether there are any abnormalities by comparing the above described physical quantity with a reference value which has been set in accordance with the conditions for spinning and is used for determining whether there are any abnormalities. In addition, the above described physical quantity is not limited to being for the pressure. A flow rate sensor for detecting the flow rate of air which flows through the pipes 45 or the connection tubes 48 and a sensor for detecting the amount of current supplied to the motors 47 or a sensor for detecting the voltage may be used as a detection portion for detecting the physical quantity that leads to an excessive load on the motors 47.  In this case also, the reference value is found in advance through Lasting in accordance with the conditions for spinning and stored in the memory 59.<br><br>
One pressure sensor 56 or flow amount sensor may be provided in each connection tube 48 as a detection portion instead of in each block.  In this case, when a suction portion S is clogged, the value of the detection signal from the pressure sensor 56 or a flow rate sensor corresponding to this suction portion S is different from the value of the detection signals from the sensors in other locations. Accordingly, it becomes possible to determine in which block there is an abnormality, as well as in which location of the block (which suction portion S) there is an abnormality.<br>
Determination sections for determining whether there are any abnormalities and contactor control portions 55 for switching the contactor 54 to a non-contact state may be provided separately. One determination section may determine whether there are any abnormalities in a plurality of blocks, and a contactor control portion 55, provided in each block, may operate through a command signal from the determination section, for example.<br>
In the case where the fine spinning machine is of a long type (having ,for example, 1000 spindles or more on both sides), the fine spinning machine may be provided with two inverters 53, one at each end of the fine spinning machine, instead of one inverter 53.<br>
The controller 57 of each fine spinning machine may be connected to a main controller for controlling the state of operation and the like of a plurality of fine spinning machines so as to make communication possible, and thus, data on the conditions for spinning may be inputted from the main controller to each controller 57.<br>
The suction pressure of the suction portion S may be<br><br>
adjusted in order to control the quality of the thread to be of an intended levels instead of adjusting the suction pressure of a suction portion S to an appropriate value in order to spin a thread having generally good quality, that is to say, a thread having little fuzzing and few spots. In addition, suction devices 45 may be driven so that the suction pressure of the suction portions S is changed as appropriate from the start of winding until the bobbin is full in order to purposely create spots as those that can be seen on design threads, instead of making the quality of the thread uniform throughout the entire length.<br>
The length of the ducts 44 is not limited to a length corresponding to eight spindles in the column on one side, that is to say, sixteen spindles in the columns on both sides, and may be a length corresponding to any appropriate number of spindles. In this case, it is preferable for the length of the ducts 44 to correspond to the number of spindles, which is a multiple of four.<br>
Two columns of ducts 44 respectively corresponding to suction portions S for the right side and the left side may be provided in the longitudinal direction of the fine spinning machine instead of the suction portions S (suction pipes 32 and 33) respectively provided on both sides of the fine spinning machine, left and right, sharing the ducts 44.<br>
The ducts 44 do not need to be provided above the rear side of the draft device 11, and they may be provided on the rear side of the draft device 11 or below the rear side of the draft device 11.<br>
The configuration is not limited to one where the rotary shaft 35 and the suction pipes 32 and 33 correspond to four spindles in one unit, and may be one where the rotary<br><br>
shaft 35 and the suction pipes 32 and 33 correspond to the spindles between the roller stands 15 (for example eight spindles), or to two spindles.  In addition, it is not necessary for all of the units to correspond to spindles that are the same in number. The spindles between the roller stands 15 may be divided into spindles of different numbers (for example 6 and 2) so that two types of units are provided so as to respectively correspond to each set of spindles.<br>
The suction pipes 32 and 33 do not need to be formed as separate bodies. In this case, the two suction pipes 32 and 33 are integrated and formed in arc form with the portion facing the top nip roller 31a open.<br>
Instead of woven cloth or knitted cloth, the ventilation apron 34 may be formed of a belt made of rubber or a resin having elasticity in which a great number of holes are created.<br>
The suction pipes 32 and 33, which form a suction portion, may be formed integrally with the connection tube 48<br>
Suction holes 32a may be provided only on the upstream side of the nip points of the fiber bundle F instead of providing suction holes 32a and 33a on the upstream side and downstream side of the nip points. In this case, approximately the same manufacturing method or assembly method as in the illustrated present embodiment can be used by making use of a suction pipe 33 having no suction holes 33a. In addition, the ventilation apron 34 may be wound around the suction pipe 32 and the bottom nip roller 35a without a suction pipe 33,<br>
In the configuration for driving the ventilation apron 34, instead of providing suction pipes 32 and 33 and a bottom<br><br>
nip roller 35a, a suction pipe of which the cross-section is oval-shaped may be provided, a suction hole may be created in a predetermined location in the suction pipe, and a ventilation apron 34 may be slidably wound around the outer periphery of the suction pipe. Also, by enabling driving of the top nip roller 31a, the ventilation apron 34 may be driven by driving the top nip roller 31a while pressing the top nip roller 31a against the ventilation apron 34.<br>
The suction devices 45 are not limited to having a configuration where the fan 47a is driven by the motor 47, and a reduced pressure pump (vacuum pump), for example, may be used. The vacuum pump may be a rotation pump or a reciprocation pump.<br>
The pneumatic device is not limited to being of a single nozzle type, and may be of a flute type.<br>
The ventilation apron 34 may be provided on the top side.<br>
The present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalence of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
