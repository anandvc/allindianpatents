METHYL-PROPYLPYRROLO[2,l-fJ[l,2s4]TRIAZINE-6-CARBOXAMIDE<br>
AND NOVEL STABLE FORMS PRODUCED THEREIN<br>
REFERENCE TO OTHER APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application takes priority from U.S. provisional application No. 60/672,255 filed April 18,2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing novel stable crystalline salt forms, including Form N-l and Form N-4 crystalline forms of the monohydrochloride salt of the free base, and Form N-l crystalline form of the methanesulfonic acid salt of the free base, of the kinase p38 inhibitor 4-[[5-[(cyclopix)pylarrimo)carbonyl]-2-methylphenyl]arru^o]-5-memyl-A propy]pyrrolo[2l-fj[l ,2,4]triazine-6-carboxamide, to such novel Form N-l and Form N-4 crystalline forms, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such novel Form N-l and Form N-4 crystalline forms, and to methods of treating a mammal to inhibit the activity of p38 kinase, and treating p38 kinase-associated conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis employing such novel N-l (methanesulfonic acid salt and hydrochloric acid salt) and N-4 (hydrochloric acid salt) crystalline forms.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A large number of cytokines participate in the inflammatory response, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. Overproduction of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, endotoxin shock, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and congestive heart failure, among others [Henry et al, Drugs Put., 24:1345-1354 (1999); Salituro et al, Curr. Med. Chem., 6:807-823 (1999)]. Evidence in human patients indicates that protein antagonists of cytokines are effective in treating chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, for example,<br>
monoclonal antibody to TNF-α (Enbrel) [Rankin et al, Br. J. Rheumatol, 34:334-342 (1995)], and soluble TNF-α receptor-Fc fusion protein (Etanercept) [Moreland etal, Ann. Intern. Med., 130:478-486 (1999)].<br>
The biosynthesis of TNF-α occurs in many cell types in response to an external stimulus, such as, for example, a mitogen, an infectious organism, or trauma. Important mediators of TNF-α production are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and in particular, p38 kinase. These kinases are activated in response to various stress stimuli, including but not limited to proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxin, ultraviolet light, and osmotic shock. Activation of p38 requires dual phosphorylation by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) on threonine and tyrosine within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif characteristic of p38 isozymes.<br>
There are four known isoforms of p383 i.e., p38-o, p38(3, p38y, and p388. The a and (3 isoforms are expressed hi inflammatory cells and are key mediators of TNF-a production. Inhibiting the p38a and P enzymes in cells results in reduced levels of TNF-α expression. Also, administering p38a and P inhibitors in animal models of inflammatory disease has proven that such inhibitors are effective in treating those diseases. Accordingly, the p38 enzymes serve an important role in inflammatory processes mediated by IL-1 and TNF-α. Compounds that reportedly inhibit p38 kinase and cytokines such as EL-1 and TNF-α for use in treating inflammatory diseases are disclosed in US Pats. Nos. 6,277,989 and 6,130,235 to Scios, Inc; US Pats. Nos. 6,147,080 and 5,945,418 to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc; US Pats Nos. 6,251,914, 5,977,103 and 5,658,903 to Smith-Kline Beecham Corp.; US Pats.

Searle &amp; Co.; WO 00/56738 and WO 01/27089 to Astra Zeneca; WO 01/34605 to Johnson &amp; Johnson; WO 00/12497 (quinazoline derivatives as p38 kinase inhibitors); WO 00/56738 (pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives for the same purpose); WO 00/12497 (discusses the relationship between p38 kinase inhibitors); and WO 00/12074 (piperazine and piperidine compounds useful as p38 inhibitors).<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, novel crystalline salt forms of the free base of the structure I<br><br>
[FORMULA REMOVED]<br>
and a process for selectively preparing such novel crystalline salt forms of the free base I axe provided.<br>
The novel crystalline forms of the invention include Form N-l of the hydrochloride salt of the free base I, Form N-4 of the hydrochloride salt of the free<br><br>
base I, the Form N-l methanesulfonic acid (MSA) salt of the free base I, the SA-2 solvate of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I, the SB-2 solvate of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I and the HI .5-3 sesquihydrate of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I. Preferred are Form N-l crystals of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I, and Form N-4 crystals of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I, both of which are non-hygroscopic from 25 up to 75% RH at 25°C and 30°C, respectively, and can be isolated and remain stable in the solid state form.<br>
It has been found that Form N-4 of the hydrochloride salt can be consistently obtained. In addition, the processes of the invention produce hydrochloric acid salts having a controlled desired particle size which is smaller (D90 
Form N-l of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I crystallizes from organic solvents, preferably, THF, as small rods. PXRD patterns of lab batches of Form N-l of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I match the hybrid PXRD pattern at room temperature. Solid state NMR also indicates a single phase. Thermal analysis using DSC indicates Form N-l melts with disproportionation in the range from about 125 to about 225°C with negligible weight loss up to about 100°C and a weight loss of about 8.2% up to about 225°C.<br>
The term "melts with disproportionation" as employed herein refers to the disassociation of the salt upon melting.<br>
The terms "hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I", "hydrogen chloride salt of the free base I" or "hydrochloride salt" or "hydrochloride acid salt" are used interchangeably herein to refer to me HC1 salt of the free base I.<br>
A moisture sorption study indicates that the Form N-1 hydrochloride salt is non-hygroscopic in the range from about 25 to about 75% RH at 25°C.<br>
Form N-4 of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I crystallizes from organic solvents, preferably DMF/acetone. PXRD patterns of lab batches of Form N-4 of the hydrochloric acid salt match the pattern simulated from the single crystal structure. Solid state NMR also indicates a single phase. Thermal analysis via DSC and TGA indicates Form N-4 melts with decomposition at from about 130 to about<br>
220°C (variable) and has negligible weight loss up to about 125°C. A moisture sorption study indicates that the Form N-4 salt is non-hygroscopic in the range from about 25 to about 75% RH at 30°C. Slurries of Form N-l and Form N-4 of the hydrochrloride salt in THF, acetonitrile, acetone and DMF/acetone convert to Form N-4 at room temperature indicating that Form N-4 is the stable form at room temperature.<br>
The Form N-4 salt will preferably have an average particle size distribution of 95% 
Form N-l of the methanesulfonic acid salt of the free base I crystallizes from organic solvents, preferably DMF, DMF/acetone or aqueous acetonitrile, as thin, elongated plates which have a neat crystal structure, N-l. PXRD of lab batches of Form N-l of the methanesulfonic acid salt of the free base I match the PXRD pattern simulated from the single crystal structure. Solid state NMR also indicates a single phase. Thermal analysis via DSC and TGA indicates that Form N-l of the methanesulfonic acid salt of the free base I melts with decomposition with endotherm onset at 216°C and has negligible weight loss up to about 150°C.<br>
The SA-2 solvate of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I is a mixed solvate (methanol/water). Single crystal structures of hydrated methanolate are obtained from methylethyl ketone/methanol. The crystals are unstable at room temperature.<br>
The SB-2 solvate of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I is a mixed solvate (isopropyl alcohol/water). Single crystal structures of hydrated isopropylate are obtained from isopropyl alcohol. The crystals are unstable at room temperature.<br>
The HI.5-3 form of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I is an unstable sesquihydrate form obtained as plates from 95% ethanol. Hot stage indicates desolvation at ~45°C and single crystals are unstable in a stream of dry Nj at -50°C.<br>
The Form N-l of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I and Form N-4 of the hydrochloride acid salt of the free base I are preferred. The Form N-4 salt is the most preferred form.<br>
The various forms of the salts of the free base I according to the invention may be characterized using various techniques, the operation of which are well known, to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art. The forms may be characterized and distinguished using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which is based on unit cell measurements of a single crystal of a form at a fixed analytical temperature. A detailed description of unit cells is provided in Stout &amp; Jensen, X-Ray Structure Determination: A Practical Guide, Macmillan Co., New York (1968), Chapter 3, which is herein incorporated by reference. Alternatively, the unique arrangement of atoms in spatial relation within the crystalline lattice may be characterized according to the observed fractional atomic coordinates. Another means of characterizing the crystalline structure is by powder X-ray diffraction analysis in which the experimental or observed diffraction profile is compared to a simulated profile representing pure powder material, both run at the same analytical temperature, and measurements for the subject form characterized as a series of 29 values.<br>
Other means of characterizing the form maybe used, such as solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. These parameters may also be used in combination to characterize the subject form.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, Form N-l of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I may be characterized by unit cell parameters substantially equal to the following:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides, at least in part, crystalline forms of free base I as a novel material, in particular in pharmaceutically acceptable form. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable", as used herein, refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. In certain preferred embodiments, crystalline salt forms of free base I are in substantially pure form. The term "substantially pure", as used herein, means a compound having a purity greater than about 90% including, for example, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, and about 100%.<br>
The term "reversed addition procedure" as employed herein refers to the step of the process of the invention wherein a slurry or solution of free base I and hydrochloric acid is added to a slurry of seeds of Form N-4 crystals of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I.<br>
5	The term "normal addition procedure" as employed herein refers to the step of<br>
the process of the invention wherein a slurry of seeds of Form N-4 crystals of the hydrochloric acid salt of the free base I is added to a slurry or solution of free base I and hydrochloric acid.<br>
As used herein "polymorph" refers to crystalline forms having the same 10     chemical composition but different spatial arrangements of the molecules, atoms, and/or ions forming the crystal.<br>
As used herein "solvate" refers to a crystalline form of a molecule, atom, and/or ions that further contains molecules of a solvent or solvents incorporated into the crystalline structure. The solvent molecules in the solvate maybe present in a 15     regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may contain either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. For example, a solvate with a nonstoichiometric amount of solvent molecules may result from partial loss of solvent from the solvate.<br>
Samples of the crystalline forms may be provided with substantially pure 20     phase homogeneity, indicating the presence of a dominant amount of a single<br>
crystalline form and optionally minor amounts of one or more other crystalline forms. The presence of more than one crystalline form in a sample may be determined by techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) or solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SSNMR). For example, the presence of extra peaks in the 25     comparison of an experimentally measured PXRD pattern with a simulated PXRD pattern may indicate more than one crystalline form in the sample. The simulated PXRD may be calculated from single crystal X-ray data, see Smith, D.K., "A FORTRAN Program for Calculating X-Ray Powder Diffraction Patterns," Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Livermore, California, UCRL-7196 (April 1963). Preferably, 30     the crystalline form has substantially pure phase homogeneity as indicated by less than 10%, preferably less than 5 %, and more preferably less than 2 % of the total peak area in the experimentally measured PXRD pattern arising from the extra peaks that<br>
are absent from the simulated PXRD pattern. Most preferred is a crystalline form having substantially pure phase homogeneity with less than 1% of the total peak area in the experimentally measured PXRD pattern arising from the extra peaks that are absent from the simulated PXRD pattern.<br>
Procedures for the preparation of crystalline forms are known in the art. The crystalline forms maybe prepared by a variety of methods, including for example, crystallization or recrystallization from a suitable solvent, sublimation, growth from a melt, solid state transformation from another phase, crystallization from a supercritical fluid, and jet spraying. Techniques for crystallization or recrystallization of crystalline forms from a solvent mixture include, for example, evaporation of the solvent, decreasing the temperature of the solvent mixture, crystal seeding a supersaturated solvent mixture of the molecule and/or salt, freeze drying the solvent mixture, and addition of antisolvents (countersolvents) to the solvent mixture.<br>
Crystals of drugs, including polymorphs, methods of preparation, and characterization of drug crystals are discussed in Solid-State Chemistry of Drugs, S.R. Byrn, R.R. Pfeiffer, and J.G. Stowell, 2nd Edition, SSCI, West Lafayette, Indiana (1999).<br>
For crystallization techniques that employ solvent, the choice of solvent or solvents is typically dependent upon one or more factors, such as solubility of the compound, crystallization technique, and vapor pressure of the solvent. Combinations of solvents may be employed, for example, the compound may be solubilized into a first solvent to afford a solution, followed by the addition of an antisolvent to decrease the solubility of the compound in the solution and to afford the formation of crystals. An antisolvent is a solvent in which the compound has low solubility. Suitable solvents for preparing crystals include polar and nonpolar solvents.<br>
In one method to prepare crystals, free base I or a salt thereof is suspended and/or stirred in a suitable solvent to afford a slurry, which maybe heated to promote dissolution. The term "slurry", as used herein, means a saturated solution of free base I or a salt thereof, which may also contain an additional amount of free base I or salt thereof to afford a heterogeneous mixture of free base I or salt thereof and a solvent at a given temperature. Suitable solvents in this regard include, for example, polar<br>
aprotic solvents, and polar protic solvents, and mixtures of two or more of these as disclosed herein.<br>
Seed crystals may be added to any crystallization mixture to promote crystallization. As will be clear to the skilled artisan, seeding is used as a means of controlling growth of a particular crystalline form or as a means of controlling the particle size distribution of the crystalline product Accordingly, calculation of the amount of seeds needed depends on the size of the seed available and the desired size of an average product particle as described, for example, in "Programmed cooling of batch crystallizers," J.W. Mullin and J. Nyvlt, Chemical Engineering Science (1971) 26:369-377. In general, seeds of small size are needed to effectively control the growth of crystals in the batch. Seeds of small size may be generated by sieving, milling, or micronizing of larger crystals, or by micro-crystallization of solutions. Care should be taken that milling or micronizing of crystals does not result in any change in crystallinity from the desired crystal form (i.e. change to amorphous or to another polymorph).<br>
A cooled mixture may be filtered under vacuum, and the isolated solids may be washed with a suitable solvent, such as cold recrystallization solvent, and dried under a nitrogen purge to afford the desired crystalline form. The isolated solids may be analyzed by a suitable spectroscopic or analytical technique, such as SSNMR, DSC, PXRD, or the like, to assure formation of the preferred crystalline form of the product. The resulting crystalline form is typically produced in an amount of greater than about 70 weight % isolated yield, but preferably greater than 90 weight % based on the weight of free base I originally employed in the crystallization procedure. The product may be comilled or passed through a mesh screen to delump the product, if necessary.<br>
Crystalline forms may be prepared directly from the reaction medium of the final process step for preparing free base I. This may be achieved, for example, by employing in the final process step a solvent or mixture of solvents from which free base I may be crystallized. Alternatively, crystalline forms may be obtained by distillation or solvent addition techniques. Suitable solvents for this purpose include any of those solvents described herein, including protic polar solvents such as alcohols, and aprotic polar solvents such as ketones.<br>
By way of general guidance, the reaction mixture may be filtered to remove any undesired impurities, inorganic salts, and the like, followed by washing with reaction or crystallization solvent. The resulting solution may be concentrated to remove excess solvent or gaseous constituents. If distillation is employed, the ultimate amount of distillate collected may vary, depending on process factors including, for example, vessel size, stirring capability, and the like. By way of general guidance, the reaction solution may be distilled to about {fraction (1/10)} the original volume before solvent replacement is carried put. The reaction may be sampled and assayed to determine the extent of the reaction and the wt % product in accordance witb standard process techniques. If desired, additional reaction solvent may be added or removed to optimize reaction concentration. Preferably, the final concentration is adjusted to about 50 wt % at which point a slurry typically results.<br>
It may be preferable to add solvents directly to the reaction vessel without distilling the reaction mixture. Preferred solvents for this purpose are those which may ultimately participate in the crystalline lattice as discussed above in connection with solvent exchange. Although the final concentration may vary depending on desired purity, recovery and the like, the final concentration of free base I in solution is preferably about 4% to about 7%. The reaction mixture may be stirred following solvent addition and simultaneously wanned. By way of illustration, the reaction mixture may be stirred for about 1 hour while warming to about 70°C. The reaction is preferably filtered hot and washed with either the reaction solvent, the solvent added or a combination thereof. Seed crystals may be added to any crystallization solution to initiate crystallization.<br>
The various forms described herein may be distinguishable from one another through the use of various analytical techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (PXRJD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and/or thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that an X-ray diffraction pattern may be obtained with a measurement error that is dependent upon the measurement conditions employed. In particular, it is generally known that intensities in a X-ray diffraction pattern may fluctuate depending upon measurement conditions employed<br>
and the shape or morphology of the crystal. It should be further understood that relative intensities may also vary depending upon experimental conditions and, accordingly, the exact order of intensity should not be taken into account. Additionally, a measurement error of diffraction angle for a conventional X-ray diffraction pattern is typically about 0.2% or less, preferably about 0.1% (as discussed hereinafter), and such degree of measurement error should be taken into account as pertaining to the aforementioned diffraction angles. Consequently, it is to be understood that the crystal forms of the instant invention are not limited to the crystal forms that provide X-ray diffraction patterns completely identical to the X-ray diffraction patterns depicted in the accompanying Figures disclosed herein. Any crystal forms that provide X- ray diffraction patterns substantially identical to those disclosed in the accompanying Figures fall within the scope of the present invention. The ability to ascertain substantial identities of X-ray diffraction patterns is within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Such conditions include diseases in which cytokine levels are modulated as a consequence of intracellular signaling via p38, and in particular, diseases that are associated with an overproduction of cytokines IL-1, IL-4, IL-8, and TNF-α. As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" encompass either or both responsive and prophylaxis measures, e.g., measures designed to inhibit or delay the onset of the disease or disorder, achieve a full or partial reduction of the symptoms or disease state, and/or to alleviate, ameliorate, lessen, or cure the disease or disorder and/or its symptoms. When reference is made herein to inhibition of "p-38α/ß kinase," this means that either p38α and/or p38ß kinase are inhibited. Thus, reference to an ICso value for inhibiting p-38α/ß kinase means that the compound has such effectiveness for inhibiting at least one of, or both of, p38α and p38ß kinases.<br>
In view of their activity as inhibitors of p38α/ß kinase, the novel salt forms of the invention are useful in treating p-38 associated conditions including, but not limited to, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, jroliferative disorders, angiogenic disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative liseases, and viral diseases.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS Generation of p38 Kinases<br>
cDNAs of human p38cc, P and y isozymes were cloned by PCR. These cDNAs were subcloned in the pGEX expression vector (Pharmacia). GST-p38 fusion protein was expressed in E. Coli and purified from bacterial pellets by affinity chromatography using glutathione agarose. p38 fusion protein was activated by incubating with constitutively active MKK6. Active p38 was separated from MKK6 by affinity chromatography. Constitutively active MKK6 was generated according to Raingeaudef al. [Mol. Cell.BioL, 1247-1255 (1996)].<br>
TNF-α Production by LPS-StimuIated PBMCs<br>
Heparinized human whole blood was obtained from healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from human whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended at a concentration of 5 x 106/ml in assay medium (RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum). 50 ul of cell suspension was incubated with 50 ul of test compound (4X concentration in assay medium containing 0.2% DMSO) in 96-well tissue culture plates for 5 minutes at RT. 100 µL of LPS (200 ng/ml stock) was then added to the cell suspension and the plate was incubated for 6 hours at 37°C. Following incubation, he culture medium was collected and stored at -20°C. TNF-OC concentration in the<br><br>
medium was quantified using a standard ELISA kit (Pharmingen-San Diego, CA). Concentrations of TNF-a and ICso values for test compounds (concentration of compound that inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-a production by 50%) were calculated by linear regression analysis.<br>
p38 Assay<br>
The assays were performed in V-bottomed 96-well plates. The final assay volume was 60 µL prepared from three 20 µL additions of enzyme, substrates (MBP and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT). Bacterially expressed, activated p38 was pre-incubated with test compounds for 10 min. prior to initiation of reaction with substrates, The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 45 min. and terminated by adding 5 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was aspirated onto a pre-wet filtermat using a Skatron Micro96 Cell Harvester (Skatron, Inc.), then washed with PBS. The filtermat was then dried in a microwave oven for 1 min., treated with MeltilLex A scintillation wax (Wallac), and counted on a Microbeta scintillation counter Model 1450 (Wallac). Inhibition data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using Prizm (GraphPadSoftware). The final concentration of reagents in the assays are ATP, 1 µM.\ [y-33P]ATP, 3 nM; MBP (Sigma, #M1891), 2µg/well; p38, 10 nM; and DMSO, 0.3%.<br>
TNF-a Production by LPS-Stimulated Mice<br>
Mice (Balb/c female, 6-8 weeks of age, Harlan Labs; n=8/treatment group) were injected intraperitoneally with 50ug/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS; E coli strain 0111:B4, Sigma) suspended in sterile saline. Ninety minutes later, mice were sedated by CO2:02 inhalation and a blood sample was obtained. Serum was separated and analyzed for TNF-alpha concentrations by commercial ELISA assay per the manufacturer's instructions (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).<br>
Test compounds were administered orally at various times before LPS injection. The compounds were dosed either as suspensions or as solutions in various vehicles or solubilizing agents.<br>

EXAMPLE 24 Studies of Crystal Forms Prepared in Previous Examples<br>
X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) data were obtained using a Bruker C2 GADDS (General Area Detector Diffraction System). The radiation was Cu Ka (40 KV, 50mA). The sample-detector distance was 15 cm. Powder samples were placed in sealed glass capillaries of 1mm or less in diameter; the capillary was rotated during data collection. Data were collected for 3 ^0 ^5° with a sample exposure time of at least 2000 seconds. The resulting two-dimensional diffraction arcs were integrated to create a traditional 1-dimensional PXRD pattern with a step size of 0.02 degrees 29 in the range of 3 to 35 degrees 20.<br>
Single crystal X-ray data were collected on a Bruker-Nonius CAD4 serial diffractometer (Bruker Axs, Inc., Madison WI). Unit cell parameters were obtained through least-squares analysis of the experimental diffractometer settings of 25 high-angle reflections. Intensities were measured using Cu Ka radiation (A = 1.5418 A) at a constant temperature with the 0-29 variable scan technique and were corrected only for Lorentz-polarization factors. Background counts were collected at the extremes of the scan for half of the time of the scan.  Alternately, single crystal data were collected on a Bruker-Nonius Kappa CCD 2000 system using Cu Ka radiation (A, = 1.5418 A). Indexing and processing of the measured intensity data were carried out with the HKL2000 software package in the Collect program suite R. Hooft, Nonius B.V. (1998). When indicated, crystals were cooled in the cold stream of an Oxford cryogenic system during data collection.<br>
The structures were solved by direct methods and refined on the basis of observed reflections using either the SDP software package SDP, Structure Determination Package, Enraf-Nonius, Bohemia, N.Y.) with minor local modifications or the crystallographic package, MAXUS (maXus solution and refinement software suit: S. Mackay, C.J. Gilmore, C. Edwards, M. Tremayne, N. Stewart, and K. Shankland. maXus is a computer program for the solution and refinement of crystal structures from diffraction data.<br>
The derived atomic parameters (coordinates and temperature factors) were refined through full matrix least-squares. The function minimized in the refinements was Z^pd - |FC|)2. R is defined as S ||F| - |F||/2 |FO| while Rw = [I^( |F0| -Pcl)2/^ |FO|2]1/2 where w is an appropriate weighting function based on errors in the observed intensities. Difference maps were examined at all stages of refinement. Hydrogen atoms were introduced in idealized positions with isotropic temperature factors, but no hydrogen parameters were varied.<br>
"Hybrid" simulated powder X-ray patterns were generated as described in the literature (Yin. S.; Scaringe, R. P.; DiMarco, J.; Galella, M. and Gougoutas, J. Z., American Pharmaceutical Review (2003), 6(2), 80). The room temperature cell parameters were obtained by performing a cell refinement using the CellRefine.xls program. Input to the program includes the 2-theta position of ca. 10 reflections,<br>
obtained from the experimental room temperature powder pattern; the corresponding Miller indices, hkl, were assigned based on the single-crystal data collected at low temperature. A new (hybrid) PXRD was calculated (by either of the software programs, Alex or Lattice View) by inserting the molecular structure determined at low temperature into the room temperature cell obtained in the first step of the procedure. The molecules are inserted in a manner that retains the size and shape of the molecule and the position of the molecules with respect to the cell origin, but, allows intermolecular distances to expand with the cell.<br>
The characteristic diffraction peak positions (degrees 26 ± 0.1) at RT of PXRD patterns shown in the accompanying Figures are based on high quality patterns collected with a diffractometer (CuKa) with a spinning capillary with 26 calibrated with a NIST or other suitable standard.<br>
All solid-state C-13 NMR measurements were made with a Bruker DSX-400, 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. High resolution spectra were obtained using high-power proton decoupling and the TPPM pulse sequence and ramp amplitude cross-polarization (RAMP-CP) with magic-angle spinning (MAS) at approximately 12 kHz. (A.E. Bennett et al, J. Chem. Phys. (1995), 103, 6951), (G. Mete, X. Wu and S.O. Smith, J. Magn. Reson. A (1994), 110, 219-227). Approximately 70 mg of sample, packed into a canister-design zirconia rotor was used for each experiment. Chemical shifts (5) were referenced to external adamantane with the high frequency resonance being set to 38.56 ppm (W.L. Earl and D.L. VanderHart, J. Magn. Reson. (1982), 48, 35-54).<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed in a TA Instruments™ model Q1000. The sample (about 2-6 mg) was weighed in an aluminum pan and recorded accurately recorded to a hundredth of a milligram, and transferred to the DSC. The instrument was purged with nitrogen gas at 50mL/min. Data were collected between room temperature and 300°C at 10°C/min heating rate. The plot was made with the endothermic peaks pointing down.<br>
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed in a TA Instruments™ model Q500. The sample (about 10-30 mg) was placed in a platinum pan previously tared. The weight of the sample was measured accurately and recorded<br>
to a thousand of a milligram by the instrument. The furnace was purged with nitrogen gas at lOOmL/min. Data were collected between room temperature and 300°C at 10°C/min heating rate.<br>
Moisture sorption isotherms were collected in a VTI SGA-100 Symmetric Vapor Analyzer using approximately 10 mg of sample. The sample was dried at 60°C until the loss rate of 0.0005 wt %/min was obtained for 10 minutes. The sample was tested at 25°C (for free base 1 andN-1 HC1 salt) or 30°C (for N-4 HC1 salt) and 3 or 4, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 50, 65, 75, 85, and 95% RH. Equilibration at each RH was reached when the rate of 0.0003 wt %/min for 35 minutes was achieved or a maximum of 600 minutes.<br>
Various crystalline forms of free base I and its solvates were prepared and are tabulated in Table 1. The unit cell data and other properties for all crystalline forms of the invention are tabulated and summarized in Table 2. The unit cell parameters were obtained from single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis.
