				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a controlled release formulation for a water soluble drug comprising, a water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient, a polysaccharide gum, a lipophilic ingredient, an inert carrier and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents and additives.<br>
The novel combination of polysaccharide gum and glyceryl behenate or other lipophilic ingredients provides the distinct release profile of the present invention and reduces the initial immediate release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
Isosorbide -5- mononitrate is a vasodilator used for the long terra treatment of cardiac insufficiency. The development of a controlled release dosage form is desirable as it provides a uniform plasma concentration and avoids peak plasma levels and the side effects associated with it. However, isosorbide -5- mononitrate exhibits some typical drawbacks such as high water solubility, the tendency to generate high static electricity when processed alone in a dry form and sublimation, which make it difficult to formulate as a controlled release product.<br>
US Patent No. 5,453,283 describes a solvent free orally administered pharmaceutical preparation containing isosorbide<br>
-1-<br><br>
-5- mononitrate in delayed release form wherein the drug is melt blended with water insoluble matrix former like polyvinyl acetate and water soluble substances like lactose as carrier, together with water insoluble substances like silicon dioxide and talcum, wherein the talcum acts as a mechanical obstacle, prolonging the diffusion path and resulting in a slowing down of the active substance released, us Patent No. 4,812,316 discloses stabilized isosorbide -5- mononitrate tablets in retard form where the drug is formulated in a stable solid solution with polyvinyl pyrrolidone and retard effect is obtained by using Hydroxy propylmethylcellulose, namely, methocel, either singly or in various combinations.<br>
WO 98/05306 discloses a controlled release tablet formulation of isosorbide -5- mononitrate where the active ingredient is granulated with a solution of a polyvinyl pyrrolidone and the drug granules are blended with cellulose based controlled release agent like Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The tablet formed can be placed in capsules along with a second active ingredient such as aspirin,<br>
US Patent No. 4,855,143 refers to a method of preparing a controlled long acting pharmaceutical tablet containing a drug and cellulose ether carrier base. The method discloses mixing the drug and the cellulose ether base material such as Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and allowing the mixture to stand for a period of time so as to allow bonding of the drug and Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and compressing portions of<br>
-2-<br><br>
the mixture into tablets.<br>
US Patent No. 5,334,393 reveals a sustained release tablet in which isosorbide -5- mononitrate in powder form having different particle sizes is added to hydrophilic swelling component such as Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, natural gums, alginic acid derivatives, etc. and at least one diluent component.<br>
US Patent No. 5,851,555 discusses controlled release dosage forms for water soluble drugs containing the active agents such as isosorbide - 5- mononitrate, niacin, etc. inert carrier, cellulosic polymer and a lipophillic ingredient. The drug was processed using either solid dispersion or melt blended with a lipophilic ingredient, milling the mass into a granulate and then blending the granulate with celluosic polymer such as Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
EP Patent no. 234670 discloses that xanthan gum has also been used in controlled release tablet formulation.<br>
US Patent No. 4,994,276, 5,128,143 and 5,135,757 describe the use of xanthan gum in combination with other gums such as locust bean gum as controlled release agent.<br>
Hence, various polysaccharide gums and cellulosic ethers such as, Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, alginates, xanthan gums etc. are known and they have all been used as controlled release agents. However, the "cellulosics" are Newtonian at low shear rates and become pseudoplastic as the shear rate increases, that is, they exhibit shear thining.<br>
-3-<br><br>
Xanthan gum on the other hand is characterized in being extremely pseudoplastic and having a high at rest viscosity, displaying four times higher viscosity compared to Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose at low shear rates, making it almost ideal as a controlled release agent.  Xanthan gum also displays viscoelasticity with high elastic modulus, which provides erosion resistance to hydrated layer.<br>
Lipophilic ingredients are used as a processing aid for preparations involving a solid dispersion, or hot melt blend technique and also act as sustained release agents.  The lipophilic ingredient generally used are fatty acid esters such as glyceryl behenate, waxes, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, cetyl alcohol, etc. Combinations of cellulosic polymer such as Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose together with lipophilic ingredient glyceryl behenate are known (US 5,851,555).<br>
The "cellulosic" based controlled release formulations suffer from drawbacks such as a relatively fast drug release profile of 10 to 12 hours for 60 mg isosorbide -5-mononitrate tablet and immediate release within the first hour of more than 25% which is normally associated with Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose based formulations. The tablets are also relatively large due to a large amount of matrix forming material required.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a controlled release formulation wherein the dose dumping of the drug during the initial 60 minutes following administration is<br>
-4-<br><br>
minimized.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a controlled release formulation which exhibits a sustained drug release profile over a longer period of time of 10 to 24 hours.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a controlled release dosage form wherein ratio of drug to controlled release matrix agent is maintained below 1:2.55 and wherein the size is kept relatively small, thus making the formulation economical and easy to swallow. The ratio of drug to controlled release matrix agent in the prior art US 5,851,555 is 1:2:75.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a controlled release formulation for a water soluble drug comprising, a water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient, a polysaccharide gum, a lipophilic ingredient, an inert carrier and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents and additives optionally in association with a second active ingredient. The controlled release formulation for oral admininstration includes matrix formulations such as matrix tablets, granules or pellets, or coated formulations such as coated tablets, granules or pellets, caplets, soft chews, gel capsules and microcapsules.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a controlled release formulation for a water soluble drug comprising,<br>
(a)       mixing a water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient, a lilophilic ingredient and part or all of the polysaccharide<br>
-5-<br><br>
gum with diluents;<br>
(b)	hot melting of the mixture to form aggregates;<br>
(c)	cooling and granulating the aggregates;<br>
(d)	blending the granulates with the remaining polysaccharide gum and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and additives; and<br>
(e)	compressing either alone or as a bilayer matrix formulation with a second active pharmaceutical ingredient or as a coated formulation or optionally as caplets, soft chews, gel capsules and microcapsules.<br>
The invention deals with controlled release formulations and processes for making orally deliverable dosage forms containing water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients, which processes overcome the processing difficulties encountered with these active pharmaceutical ingredients, and which controlled release formulations exhibit a sustained drug release profile over a longer period of time of 10 to 24 hours wherein the immediate rapid release of the drug (dose dumping) during the initial 60 minutes following administration is minimized.  Further, the size is kept relatively small, thus making the formulation economical and easy to swallow.<br>
The present invention provides a controlled release formulation for a water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient comprising, a water soluble active pharmaceutical-ingredient, a polysaccharide gum, a lipophilic ingredient, an inert carrier and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients,<br>
-6-<br><br>
diluents and additives.<br>
Preferably, the formulations of the invention contain, as essential ingredients, a water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient in the range 5 to 50%; polysaccharide gum in the range 5 to 50%; and lipophilic ingredient in the range 5 to 50%,  Preferred ranges of the essential ingredients are a water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient in the range 20 to 40%; polysaccharide gum in the range 10 to 40%; and lipophilic ingredient in the range 10 to 40%.<br>
The novel combination of xanthan gum and glyceryl behenate or other lipophilic ingredients provides the distinct release profile of the present invention and reduces the initial immediate release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
Polysaccharide gum is selected from the group comprising xanthan gum, gellan gum, locust bean gum, gum caraya, etc. The preferred polysaccharide gum is xanthan gum.<br>
Xanthan gum exhibits a high affinity for water and hydrates rapidly forming a gel layer around the formulation thus minimizing the immediate rapid release of the drug during the initial 60 minutes following administration, which is a characteristic of Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
Isosorbide -5- mononitrate and the lipophilic ingredient such as glyceryl behenate are melted together, when the molten drug gets dispersed in the wax phase. The molten wax is cooled, and the isosorbide -5- mononitrate crystalizes<br>
-7-<br><br>
first due to its high melting point (90°C). The isosorbide -5- mononitrate crystals formed are surrounded by molten wax. On further cooling, this molten wax forms a uniform coating on the isosorbide -5-mononitrate crystals.<br>
The invention provides drug release sustained over a longer period of time of 10 to 24 hours upon oral administration.<br>
Further, as xanthan gum has a faster hydration rate and is highly pseudoplastic and viscoelastic as compared to cellulose, hence, less xanthan gum is required and the dosage form weight and thereby size is kept relatively small with less matrix forming ingredient, making the oral dosage form of the formulation economical and easy to swallow.<br>
The lipophilic ingredient is selected from a fatty acid ester such as glyceryl behenate, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, wax and cetyl alcohol either alone or in combination with the fatty acid ester.<br>
The preferred carriers are lactose, mannose, etc. The ratio of the active agent to the carrier is in the range of 4:1 to 2:1.<br>
Examples of water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients are isosorbide -5- mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, venlafaxine hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride, metformin hydrochloride, diltiazem hydrochloride their combinations and other pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble active ingredients thereof.<br>
-8-<br><br>
Lubricants such as stearic acid, magnesium stearate, etc may be used.<br>
Colorants such as pigments, lakes, iron oxide, etc may by used.<br>
The formulation thus prepared may be compressed alone as a tablet or may be compressed as bilayered tablet along with a second active ingredient. One of the suitable second active ingredients is Aspirin. Aspirin in the form of "Encapsulated Aspirin"(available under the brand name "Gattaprine" from Gattafosse) may also be used which minimizes the side effect such as gastric irritation associated with Aspirin. It also enhances the stability of Aspirin.<br>
