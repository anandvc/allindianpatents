This patent applicaton claims the benefit of priority under Title 35 United States<br>
Code, section 119(e), of Provisional Patent Application No. 60/429,041 filed November<br>
22, 2002; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vitamin D3 Receptor (VDR) is a ligand dependent transcription factor that<br>
belongs to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. The VDR protein is 427 amino<br>
acids, with a molecular weight of ~50 kDa. The VDR ligand, 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3<br>
(the hormonally active form of Vitamin D) has its action mediated by its interaction with<br>
the nuclear receptor known as Vitamin D receptor ("VDR"). The VDR ligand, 1a,25-<br>
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1a,25(OH)2D3) acts upon a wide variety of tissues and cells both<br>
related to and unrelated to calcium and phosphate homeostasis.<br>
The activity 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in various systems suggests wide clinical,<br>
applications. However, use of conventional VDR ligands is hampered by their associated<br>
toxicity, namely hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium). Currently, 1a,25(OH)2D3<br>
marketed as Rocaltrol® pharmaceutical agent ( product of Hoffmann-La Roche), is<br>
administered to kidney failure patients undergoing chronic kidney dialysis to treat<br>
hypocalcemia and the resultant metabolic bone disease. Other therapeutic agents, such as<br>
Calcipotriol® (synthetic analog of 1a,25(OH)2D3 ) show increased separation of binding<br>
affinity on VDR from hypercalcemic activity.<br>
Chemical modifications of 1a,25(OH)2D3 have yielded analogs with attenuated<br>
calcium mobilization effects (R. Bouillon et. al, Endocrine Rev. 1995,16, 200-257). One<br>
such analog, Dovonex ® pharmaceutical agent (product of Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co.), is<br>
currently used in Europe and the United States as a topical treatment for mild to moderate<br>
psoriasis (K. Kragballe et. al., Br. J. Dermatol. 1988, 119, 223-230).<br>
Other Vitamin D3 mimics have been described in the publication, Vitamin D<br>
Analogs: Mechanism of Action of Therapeutic Applications, by Nagpal, S.; Lu, J.;<br>
Boehm, M. F., Cuir. Med. Chem. 2001, 8,1661-1679.<br>
Although some degree of separation between the beneficial action and calcium<br>
raising (calcemic) effects has been achieved with these VDR ligands, to date the<br>
separation has been insufficient to allow for oral administration to treat conditions such as<br>
osteoporosis, cancers, leukemias, and severe psoriasis.<br>
One example of a major class of disorder that could benefit from VDR mediated<br>
biological efficacy in the absence of hypercalcemia is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a<br>
systemic disorder characterized by decreased bone mass and microarchitectural<br>
deterioration of bone tissue leading to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to<br>
fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist (World Health Organization WHO 1994).<br>
Osteoporosis affects an estimated 75 million people in the United States, Europe, and<br>
Japan.<br>
Within the past few years, several antiresorptive therapies have been introduced.<br>
These include bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a selective estrogen<br>
receptor modulator (SERM), and calcitonins. These treatments reduce bone resorption,<br>
bone formation, and increase bone density. However, none of these treatments increase<br>
true bone volume nor can they restore lost bone architecture.<br>
Another major disorder that could benefits from VDR mediated biological activity<br>
is psoriasis. Psoriasis is one of the most common dermatologic diseases and is a chronic<br>
inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous, sharply demarcated papules<br>
and rounded plaques, covered by silvery micaceous scale.<br>
Synthetic VDR ligands with reduced calcemic potential have been synthesized.<br>
For example, a class of bis-phenyl compounds stated to mimic 1a, 25-dihydroxyvitamin<br>
D3 is described in US Patent No. 6,218,430 and the article; "Novel nonsecosteroidal<br>
vitamin D mimics exert VDR-modulating activities with less calcium mobilization than<br>
1a, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3' by Marcus F. Boehm, et. al., Chemistry &amp; Biology 1999,<br>
Vol6,No.5,pgs.265-275.<br>
Synthetic VDR ligands having an aryl-thiophene nucleus are described in United<br>
States provisional patent application SN 60/384151, filed 29 May 2002.<br>
There remains a need for improved treatments using alternative or improved<br>
pharmaceutical agents that mimic 1a, 25-dihydroxyvitaniin D3 to stimulate bone<br>
formation, restore bone quality, and treat other diseases without the attendant<br>
disadvantage of hypercalcemia.<br>

Further NMR data: COSY data allowed the spin systems of the two aromatic rmgs to be<br>
grouped together. When the OCH2 was selectively excited, a NOE is observed with a<br>
resonance at 6.62 8 which is ortho only coupled. When the aromatic methyl (at 2.32 5)<br>
was excited, a NOE is observed to a meta coupled proton at 7.04 8. These resonances are<br>
not part of the same spin system, requiring the OCH2 and aromatic methyl to be on<br>
different rings. Therefore the triflate has migrated during the reaction and the isolated<br>
product has the structure shown above. (HMBC data also supports this conclusion.)<br>

Compounds of the Invention - Salts. Stereoisomers. &amp; Prodrups:<br>
Salts of the compounds represented by formulae (I) are an additional aspect of the<br>
invention. The skilled artisan will also appreciate that the family of compounds of<br>
formulae I include acidic and basic members and that the present invention includes<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
In those instances where the compounds of the invention possess acidic or basic<br>
functional groups various salts may be formed which are more water soluble and<br>
physiologically suitable than the parent compound. Representative pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, include but are not limited to, the alkali and alkaline earth salts such as<br>
lithium, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and the<br>
like. Salts are conveniently prepared from the free acid by treating the acid in solution<br>
with a base or by exposing the acid to an ion exchange resin. For example, a carboxylic<br>
acid substituent on the compound of Formula I may be selected as -CO2H and salts may<br>
be formed by reaction with appropriate bases (e.g., NaOH, KOH) to yield the<br>
corresponding sodium and potassium salt.<br>
Included within the definition of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are the<br>
relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the<br>
present invention, for example, ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations,<br>
derived from nitrogenous bases of sufficient basicity to form salts with the compounds of<br>
this invention (sec, for example, S. M. Berge, et al, "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. Phar. Sci..<br>
66: 1-19 (1977)). Moreover, the basic group(s) of the compound of the invention may be<br>
reacted with suitable organic or inorganic acids to form salts such as acetate,<br>
benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfatc, bitartrate, boratc, bromide, camsylate,<br>
carbonate, chloride, choline, clavulanate, citrate, chloride, chloroprocaine, choline,<br>

succinate, sulfate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate, trifluoromethane<br>
sulfonate, and valerate.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention may possess one or more chiral centers and<br>
may thus exist in optically active forms. Likewise, when the compounds contain an<br>
alkenyl or alkenylene group there exists the possibility of cis- and trans- isomeric forms of<br>
the compounds. The R- and S- isomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures<br>
as well as mixtures of cis- and trans- isomers, are contemplated by this invention.<br>
Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent group such as an<br>
alkyl group. All such isomers as well as the mixtures thereof are intended to be included<br>
in the invention. If a particular stereoisomer is desired, it can be prepared by methods<br>
well known in the art by using stereospecific reactions with starting materials which<br>
contain the asymmetric centers and are already resolved or, alternatively by methods<br>
which lead to mixtures of the stereoisomers and subsequent resolution by known<br>
methods. For example, a chiral column may be used such as those sold by Daicel<br>
Chemical Industries identified by the trademarks:<br>

CHIRALPAK OG, CHIRALPAK OK, and<br>
CHIRALPAK CA-1.<br>
By another conventional method, a racemic mixture may be reacted with a single<br>
enantiomer of some other compound. This changes the racemic form into a mixture of<br>
diastereomers. These diastereomers, because they have different melting points, different<br>
boiling points, and different solubilities can be separated by conventional means, such as<br>
crystallization.<br>

The present invention is also embodied in mixtures of compounds of formulae I.<br>
Prodrugs are derivatives of the compounds of the invention which have chemically<br>
or metabolically cleavablc groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological<br>
conditions the compounds of the invention which are pharmaccutically active in vivo.<br>
Derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and base<br>
derivative forms, but the acid derivative form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue<br>
compatibility, or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of<br>
Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives<br>
well known to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of<br>
the parent acidic compound with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the<br>
parent acid compound with a suitable amine. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters derived<br>
from acidic groups pendent on the compounds of this invention arc preferred prodrugs. In<br>
some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy) alkyl<br>
esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkyl esters. Particularly preferred esters to use as<br>
prodrugs are; methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl,<br>
morpholinoethyl, and N,N-diethylglycolamido.<br>
N,N-diethylglycolamido ester prodrugs may be prepared by reaction of the sodium<br>
salt of a compound of Formula (I) (in a medium such as dimethylformamid6) with 2-<br>
chloro-N,N-diethylacetamide (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,<br>
Wisconsin USA; Item No.25,099-6).<br>
Morpholinylethyl ester prodrugs may be prepared by reaction of the sodium salt of<br>
a compound of Formula (I) (in a medium such as dimethylformamid6) 4-(2-<br>
chloroethyl)morpholine hydrochloride (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,<br>
Wisconsin USA, Item No. C5.220-3).<br>
Morpholinylethyl ester prodrugs may be prepared by reaction of the sodium salt of<br>
a compound of Formula I (in a medium such as dimethytformamid6) 4-(2-<br>
chlorocthyl)morpholinc hydrochloride (available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee,<br>
Wisconsin USA, Item No. C5.220-3). The prodrugs, for example, may be prepared by<br>
reaction of the sodium salt for a compound of Formula I with;<br>
Also, lower alkyl (viz., C1-C8) ester prodrugs may be prepared by conventional<br>
means such as reacting the sodium or potassium salt (derived by forming the salt of any<br>
acidic compound of the invention, viz., reaction of a base such as KOH with an acidic<br>
group such as CO2H) of a compound of Formula 1 with an alkyl iodide such as methyl<br>
iodide, ethyl iodide, n-propyl iodide, isopropyl iodide. Typical ester prodrug substitucnts<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations containing the Novel Compounds of the Invention:<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention are prepared by combining (e.g.,<br>
mixing) a thcrapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention<br>
(compounds of Formula I) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or<br>
diluent. The present pharmaceutical formulations arc prepared by known procedures<br>
using well-known and readily available ingredients.<br>
In making the compositions of the present invention, the compounds of<br>
Formula I will usually be admixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed<br>
within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container.<br>
When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid material<br>
which acts as a vehicle, or can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges,<br>
elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid<br>
medium), or ointment, containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the<br>
compound. The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated prior to<br>
administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be delivered by suitable formulations<br>
contained in a transderm patch. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be<br>
delived to a patient by sublingual administration.<br>
For the pharmaceutical formulations any suitable carrier known in the art can be<br>
used. In such a formulation, the carrier may be a solid, liquid, or mixture of a solid and a<br>
liquid. Solid form formulations include powders, tablets and capsules. A solid carrier<br>
can be one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants,<br>
solubilisers, suspending agents, binders, tablet disintegrating agents and encapsulating<br>
material.<br>
Tablets for oral administration may contain suitable oxcipients such as calcium<br>
carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate, together with disintegrating<br>
agents, such as maize, starch, or alginic acid, and/or binding agents, for example,<br>
gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or<br>
talc.<br>
In powders the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the<br>
finely divided Active ingredient. In tablets the compound of Formula I is mixed with a<br>
carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in<br>
the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from about 1 to<br>
about 99 weight percent of the compound which is the novel compound of this invention.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar lactose,<br>
pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, low melting waxes, and cocoa butter.<br>
Sterile liquid form formulations include suspensions, emulsions, syrups and<br>
elixirs.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be dissolved or suspended in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a<br>
mixture of both. The compounds can often be dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, for<br>
instance aqueous propylene glycol. Other compositions can be made by dispersing the<br>
finely divided compounds of the invention in aqueous starch or sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose solution or in a suitable oil.<br>

Particularly preferred is the treatment of psoriasis and osteoporosis by<br>
administration to a mammal (including a human) of a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of compounds of Formulae I. By "pharmaceutically effective amount" it is meant that<br>
quantity of pharmaceutical agent corresponding to formulae I which prevents, removes<br>
or reduces the deleterious effects of a disease state in mammals, including humans.<br>
The specific dose of a compound administered according to this invention to<br>
obtain therapeutic or prophylactic effects will, of course, be determined by the particular<br>
circumstances surrounding the case, including, for example, the compound administered,<br>
the route of administration and the condition being treated. Typical daily doses will<br>
contain a pharmaceutically effective amount typically in the range of from about 0.0001<br>
mg/kg/day to about 50 mg/kg/day of body weight of an active compound of this<br>
invention. Preferably the dose of compounds of the invention will be from 0.0001 to 5<br>
mg/kg/day of body weight.<br>
Preferably compounds of the invention (e.g., per Formula I) or pharmaceutical<br>
formulations containing these compounds are in unit dosage form for administration to<br>
a mammal. The unit dosage form can be a capsule or tablet itself, or the appropriate<br>
number of any of these. The quantity of Active ingredient in a unit dose of composition<br>
may be varied or adjusted from about 0.0001 to about 1000 milligrams or more<br>
according to the particular treatment involved. It may be appreciated that it is<br>
necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and condition<br>
of the patient. Dosage will also depend on the route of administration. The compounds<br>
of the inventiion may be administered by a variety of routes including oral, aerosol,<br>
rectal, transdcrmal, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and<br>
mtranasal. Particularly preferred is the treatment of psoriasis with an ointment type<br>
formulation containing the compounds of the invention. The ointment formulation<br>
may be applied as needed, typically lrom one to 6 times daily.<br>
Treatment of psoriasis is preferably done with topical application by a<br>
formulation in the form of a cream, oil, emulsion, paste or ointment containing a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound defined by Formula (I), and in<br>
particular those compounds set out in Tables 1 or 2 or those compounds identified as<br>
"AA" to "BQ", supra. The formulation for topical treatment contains from 0.5 to<br>
0.00005 weight percent, preferably from .05 to 0.0005 weight percent, and most<br>
preferably from 0.025 to 0.001 of a compound defined by formula (I).<br>
For example, two semisolid topical preparations useful as vehicles for VDR<br>
modulators in treatment and prevention of psoriasis are as follows:<br>
Polyethylene Glycol Ointment USP (p. 2495)<br>
Prepare Polyethylene Glycol Ointment as follows:<br>
Polyethylene Glycol 3350 400 g.<br>
Polyethylene Glycol 400 600 g.<br>
To make 1000 g.<br>
Heat the two ingredients on a water bath to 65C. Allow to cool, and stir<br>
until congealed. If a firmer preparation is desired, replace up to 100 g of<br>
the polyethylene glycol 400 with an equal amount of polyethylene glycol<br>
3350.<br>
Hvdrophilic Ointment USP (p. 1216)<br>
Prepare Hydrophilic Ointment as follows:<br>
Methylparaben 0.25 g.<br>
Propylparaben 0.15 g.<br>
Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 10 g.<br>
Propylene Glycol 120 g.<br>
Stearyl Alcohol 250 g.<br>
White Petrolatum 250 g.<br>
Purified Water 370 g.<br>
To make about 1000 g.<br>
The Stearyl Alcohol and White Petrolatum are melted on a steam bath, and<br>
wanned to about 75C. The other ingredients, previously"dissolved in the water are added,<br>
warmed to 75C, and the mixture stirred until it congeals.<br>
For each of the above formulations the compound of formula (I) is added during<br>
the heating step in an amount that is from 0.5 to 0.00005 weight percent, preferably from<br>
.05 to 0.0005 weight percent, and most preferably from 0.025 to 0.001 weight percent of<br>
the total ointment weight. (Source: - United States Pharmacopoeia 24, United States<br>

Assay Methods<br>
Use of the Assay Methods;<br>
The evaluation of the novel compounds of the invention for osteoporosis and other<br>
related diseases is done using a plurality of test results. The use of multiple assays is<br>
necessary since the combined properties of (i) high activity for the vitamin D receptor,<br>
and (ii) prevention of hypercalcemia must be achieved to have utility for the methods of<br>
treating diseases, which are also, aspects of this invention. Some of the tests described<br>
below arc believed related to other tests and measure related properties of compounds.<br>
Consequently, a compound may be considered to have utility in the practice of the<br>
invention if is meets most, if not all, of the acceptance criteria for the above described<br>
tests.<br>
The evaluation of the novel compounds of the invention for psoriasis is done using<br>
the Keratinocyte Proliferation Assay in combination with other assays that measure<br>
inhibition of II--2 production and stimulation of IL-10 production in peripheral blood<br>
mononuclear cells (PBMCs).<br>
Brief Description. Utility and Acceptance Criteria for the Assay Methods:<br>
1. The RXR-VDR heterodimcrAssav:<br>
This assay provides the VDR activity of a test compound. It is<br>
desirable to have low EC.50 values for a compound in this assay. The lower the KC50<br>
value, the more active the compound will be as a VDR agonist. Desired assay results<br>
are EC50 values less than or equal to 600 nM. Preferred assay results arc less than<br>
250 nM, and most preferably less than 150 nM.<br>
2. The Caco-2 cell Co-transfcction Assay:<br>
The Caco-2 cell assay is an indicator for the undesirable condition of<br>
hypercalcernia. This co-transfection assay is a surrogate assay for in vivo calcemic<br>
activity of VDR ligands. It is desirable to have high EC50 values for a test compound<br>
in this assay. The higher the EC50 values for a compound the less calcemic it will be<br>
in vivo. Desired assay results are EC50 greater than or equal to 300 nM. Preferred<br>
assay results are greater than 1000 nM.<br>
3. The OCN (osteocalcini Promoter Assay<br>
The OCN Promoter Assay is an indicator and marker for osteoporosis.<br>
Desired assay results arc EC50 less than or equal to 325 nM. Preferred assay results<br>
are less than 50 nM.<br>
4. The Mouse Hypercalcemia Assay<br>
The Mouse Hypercalcemia Assay is a six day hypcrcalcemia test for toxicity<br>
and selectivity. Acceptable test results are levels greater than 300 ng/kg/day.<br>
Preferred assay results are levels greater than 1000 ng/kg/day.<br>
5. The Keratinocvte Proliferation Assay<br>
This Assay is indicative for the treatment of psoriasis. An acceptable test result<br>
is IC50 value of less than or equal to 300 nM. Preferred assay results are IC50 values<br>
of less than 100 nM.<br>
6. The IL-10 induction Assay<br>
This is an in vitro efficacy assay for psoriasis, abscess and adhesion. Psoriasis involves<br>
both keratinocytes and immune cells. II.-10 is a unique cytokinc because it is anti-<br>
inflammatory and immunosuppressjve. This assay tells us whether a VDRM is able to<br>
function as an agonist in PBMCs (primary blood mononuclcar cells) or not. A lower<br>
EC50 value is desirable in this assay since a compound with a lower EC50 value will be a<br>
better agonist in PBMCs. An acceptable test result is an EC50 value of less than 200 nM.<br>
Preferred assay results are EC50 values of less than 100 nM.<br>
7. Other Compound Assay Standards<br>
An alternative measure of the therapeutic index (bone efficacy vx. Hypervcalcemia) of<br>
compounds of the invention for treatment of osteoporosis is a numerical ratio<br>
calculated as follows:<br>
Dose Threshold needed to induce hypercalcemia<br>
divided by<br>
Dose Threshold needed for bone efficacy<br>
An alternative measusre of the therapeutic index (in vivo keratinocyte proliferation vs.<br>
hypercalcemia) of compounds of the invention for treatment of psoriasis is a<br>
numerical ratio calculated as follows:<br>
Dose Threshold needed to induce hypercalcemia<br>
divided by<br>
Dose Threshold needed to induce keratinocyte proliferation<br>
For the above ratios, Dose Thresholds are determined from dose response curve data.<br>
