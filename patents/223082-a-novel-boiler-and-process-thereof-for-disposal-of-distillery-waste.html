				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to novel boiler, system and process for distillery waste management particularly, but not exclusively, to boiler systems for furnaces, which are capable of burning in addition to conventional fuel, the distillery waste.<br>
Such boiler include a separate super heater furnace and two-stage economizers and air heaters wherein water and hot air are heated in two stages from the heat recovered from the super heater furnace and boiler flue gases.<br>
BACK GROUND AND PRIOR ARTS:<br>
In the conventional effluent treatment system the effluent discharged from the distillery is subjected to digestion for 20-30 days in a digester so as to produce Methane gas. The gas thus produced is fired in a conventional boiler along with main fuel.<br>
In the above process, the distilleries produce considerable amount of effluent liquid, which constitutes a hazardous environmental pollutant, disposal of which is a major problem. A distillery having capacity of 200-kilo liter per day produces around 2000-2600 kiloliter of effluent daily.<br>
Therefore, minimum storage capacity of digester of 200KL distillery is more than twenty times of per day discharge. This requires a big investment and a large land area.<br>
Further, the discharge of wastewater from the system is having BOD of 300 mg/ltr whereas the permitted BOD is less than 150 mg/ltr, which also produces foul smell. This causes environmental pollution.<br>
Consequently there is a need to eliminate the digester and further need to separate the water from the waste or effluent of distillery so as to reuse it in the distillery.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, the waste or effluent of the distillery is concentrated in the concentration unit whereas the water<br><br>
recovered is reused in the distillery and concentrated slop is obtained. The concentrated slop (waste liquid of distillery after distillation) with solids is acidic and contains potash, chlorides, sulphates and oxides of sodium, magnesium and calcium.<br>
It cannot be burnt in conventional boiler for the following reasons:<br>
1.	It has low calorific value with high moisture, hence cannot sustain combustion.<br>
2.	It has problem of choking of flue gases path due to high potash and other chemicals deposition.<br>
3.	Due to chloride contents, it corrodes the boiler pressure parts when subjected to high temperature i.e &gt;380 degree centigrade<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a specially designed boiler and process thereof for disposal of distillery waste, which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior arts.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a novel boiler, system and process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, which does not cause water and environmental pollution due to absence of effluent discharge.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a novel boiler, system and process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, which contributes towards retention of ground water.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a novel boiler, system and process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, which causes saving of conventional fuel as the effluent is used as fuel.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a system for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, which does not require a huge land unlike prior art and is economical.<br><br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a system and process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, which requires no or less supporting fuel i.e. less than 25%.<br>
Yet another further object of this invention is to propose a system and process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, wherein the steam is generated at high pressure and temperature in which the steam after producing power is supplied for concentration and distillery use.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler, which produces ash, which is a high-grade potash fertilizer.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to novel boiler, system and process for distillery waste management particularly, but not exclusively, to boiler systems for furnaces, which are capable of burning in addition to conventional fuel, the distillery waste. Such boiler include a separate super heater furnace and two-stage economizers and air heaters wherein water and hot air fed in to the boiler are heated in two stages from the heat recovered from the super heater and boiler flue gases. According to this invention, there is provided a process for disposal of distillery waste using a novel boiler comprising steps of concentration of distillery waste to obtain semi-solids followed by burning of the semi¬solids in said boiler to generate steam with potassic ash. The boiler system comprises a main boiler wherein furnace, flue gases passes, non-Clogging nozzles and heights at which these nozzles are placed are so designed to facilitate effective burning of SLOP (waste liquid of distillery after distillation), a separate super heater outside the body of boiler with independent temperature control, a two stage economizer for heating the feed water in the boiler and two stage air heater to supply hot air to the boiler.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
FIG. 1 shows process diagram of conventional distillery waste management system.<br>
FIG. 2 shows process diagram of invented distillery waste management system.<br>
FIG. 3 shows block diagram and process flow of novel boiler system<br>
FIG.4 shows pictorial view of novel boiler<br>
FIG.5 shows schematic diagram of slop fired novel incineration boiler<br>
FIG.6 shows schematic of separate super heater with independent temperature control<br>
FIG.7 shows conventional boiler with integral super heater<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Refer to Fig. 2 wherein waste or effluent generated from distillery is concentrated in a concentration unit to obtain 55-60% of semi-solids. Remaining water is supplied back to the distillery for reuse. This reduces water requirement of the distillery.<br>
The concentrated slop thus obtained is fired in a slop fired incineration boiler of the present invention along with/without supporting fuel. The concentrated slop (waste liquid of distillery after distillation) is acidic and contains potash, chlorides, sulphates and oxides of sodium, magnesium and calcium.<br><br>
It cannot be burnt in conventional boiler for the following reasons:<br>
1.	It has low calorific value with high moisture, hence cannot sustain combustion.<br>
2.	It has problem of choking of flue gas path due to high potash and other chemicals deposition.<br>
3.	Due to chloride contents, it corrodes the boiler pressure parts when subjected to high skin temperature i.e &gt;380°C.<br>
The steam produced after burning the effluent takes care of the steam requirement of concentration plant. Further, the steam generated at high pressure and temperature (for example: 45kg/cm2 and 430°C) is used by turbine to produce electric power as bi-product. The steam after producing power is supplied to concentration unit and distillery.<br>
The evaporated water available as distilled water from the concentration plant is reused in distillery.<br>
The flue gas containing ash dumps the potassic ash after cyclonic action into the hoppers (13 of Fig.4) provided at the bottom of the boiler. The ash contains high grade of Potash, which is used as fertilizers. Due to high potash contents, firing of this fuel is not possible in conventional boilers.<br>
This system totally eliminates the storage of effluent and use of digesters.<br>
Referring to fig no 1 where conventional system is depicted in which distillery waste or effluent discharged is collected in the digester and kept therein for 20-30 days in digester so as to produce biogases such as methane. The gas thus produced is fired in a conventional boiler with fuel so as to produce steam.<br>
The remaining effluent is sent to digester and thereafter discharged to ground thereby creating environmental pollution by contaminating ground water and releasing foul smells.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 3, which shows block diagram and process flow of novel boiler. According to present invention, where super heater is placed separately out of the main boiler to have independent control of temperature, the heat obtained from super heater flue gases is utilized to heat 'input feed water' of boiler in first stage economizer of two stage economizers of boiler system. The first stage economizer is outside the main boiler and heats feed water up to 150-160°C. This water is further heated in second stage economizer which is integral to main boiler up to 250-260°C and fed on to main boiler steam drum and which is finally converted in to steam.<br>
A part of super heater furnace heat is also utilized to heat input air in first stage air heater of two stages of air heaters. This input air is supplied to the main boiler furnace after further heating in second stage air heater. The second stage air heater is integral part of main boiler whereas first stage air heater is outside it.<br>
Reference may be made to fig. 4 of novel boiler for its general structure which comprises a furnace (14) surrounded by a refractory compartment to maintain constant combustion temperature required for firing concentrated slop generated from the concentration unit. The concentrated slop is supplied from a height under pressure (10 to 15 Kg/cm2) through non-Clogging nozzles (17), which burns completely while traveling downward a chamber (9). After combustion, the gases at high temperature of about 600-700°C enter into second and third chambers (10 &amp; 11) as shown where they revolve in a cyclonical action for better heat transfer. In the same fashion, the gases are routed to fourth and fifth chambers as shown. The number of chambers can vary as per requirement. The cyclonic action results in better heat transfer and settling of potassic ash into the hoppers provided underneath. Thereafter the gases are discharged to chimney through economizer, air pre heater, pollution control system and ID fan. The steam generation part of boiler is made of membrane type water walls comprising a plurality of tubes (2). The number of chambers provided in the boiler adjoining to the chamber (9) are around four in number where cyclonic action in gas takes place. The boiler further comprises a fuel feeder (15) for feeding fuel therein and headers (3 &amp; 4) on top three sides connected to a steam drum (1) for water circulation. Further, the boiler is provided with soot blowers (19) for on line cleaning of the flue paths.<br><br>
Referring FIG. 5, 6 and 7, which shows schematic diagrams of novel boiler with separate super heater as compared to conventional boiler with integral super heater. The furnace of this novel boiler is so designed that it maintains constant combustion temperature in the range of 700-900 degree centigrade to burn the slop containing high moisture with/without support fuel like baggasse, rice husk, coal, woodchips, pet coke, other biomass etc.<br>
The furnace volumetric heat release rate is kept low (0.05-0.075 Mkcal/M3 /hour) in comparison to conventional boiler (0.175-0.250 Mkcal/M3 /hour) to avoid the distillation of potash and other oxides.<br>
The residence time of gases is kept more (6.0 to 9.0 seconds) for proper combustion of fuel with high moisture in comparison to conventional boiler (2.5-3.0) seconds.<br>
The flue gas passes are designed in such a way that maximum suspended particles are arrested inside the boiler itself.<br>
The specially designed non-clogging type nozzles are used to spray the concentrated slop in the boiler furnace from a particular height for its proper combustion.<br>
The combustion air is pre heated in two stages. In the first stage it is heated up to 70-80°C by recovering heat of flue gases from super heater furnace. In the second stage, it is re-heated from the flue gases of boiler up to 150-160°C. This eliminates back-end corrosion of air pre heater of boiler.<br>
The input feed water is also pre heated in two stages. In the first stage it is heated up to 150-160°C by recovering the heat of flue gases from the super heater furnace. In second stage, it is re-heated from the flue gases of boiler up to 250-260°C. Because of which the dew point corrosion of economizer coil is prevented.<br>
Further the super heater is installed outside the boiler with independent furnace to prevent corrosion of super heater as slop contains chemicals, which cause corrosion, if skin temperature of super heater tubes exceeds 380°C. Since the super heater is having<br><br>
its independent furnace and temperature control system, the required super heat steam temperature can be achieved independently.<br>
This invention results in more steam generation and as a result more electricity. Further, the boiler generates potassic ash, which is used as fertilizer.<br>
The process of the present invention leads to reduction in water requirement of distillery to almost half as water recovered from concentration unit is taken back for reuse.<br>
Further, the invention causes higher power production as the entire steam generated is passed through turbine including the steam required for concentration.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
