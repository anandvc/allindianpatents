[Title of the Invention] SYNCHRONIZING BRAKE DEVICE FOR VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a synchronizing brake device for a vehicle that synchronizes and operates a hydraulic brake and a mechanical brake, particularly relates to the air bleeding of a hydraulic master cylinder used for the synchronizing brake device for a vehicle.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
For a synchronizing brake device for a vehicle, a synchronizing brake device for a vehicle that operates a hydraulic disc brake and a mechanical drum brake with either of two brake operating levers and operates the hydraulic disc brake with the other is known.<br>
This type of synchronizing brake device for a vehicle uses a master cylinder unit where such a mechanism that the hydraulic disc brake and the mechanical drum brake can  he selectively operated, for example, a hydraulic master cylinder and a lever mechanism are combined.<br>
For such a synchronizing brake device for a vehicle, the one where a hydraulic brake and a mechanical brake are synchronized using the same hydraulic master cylinder is known (For example, refer to a patent document 1). [0003]<br>
The synchronizing brake device for a vehicle in the<br><br>
patent document 1 is a synchronizing brake device for a vehicle where only a hydraulic brake is operated with a first brake lever (a right lever) and the hydraulic brake and a mechanical brake are operated with a second brake lever (a left lever), and in a case that the hydraulic brake is operated with the first brake lever and in a case that the hydraulic brake and the mechanical brake are operated with the second brake lever, the same master cylinder is also used. [0004]<br>
In such a synchronizing brake device for a vehicle, air bleeding in a hydraulic circuit including the master cylinder can be executed by operating the first brake lever.<br>
For example, when structure that a first master cylinder dedicated to the hydraulic brake is provided to the first brake lever and a master cylinder unit for operating the hydraulic brake and the mechanical brake with the second brake lever is provided is adopted, the air bleeding of a second master cylinder to be a component of the master cylinder unit is executed by the second brake lever.<br>
However, as the second brake lever is a lever for operating the hydraulic brake and the mechanical brake, the mechanical brake is also operated in air bleeding. Therefore, there is a problem that most of a manipulated variable and the operation force of the second brake lever is used for the operation of the mechanical brake and the motion of a delay spring which is a component of the master<br><br>
cylinder unit and others and it takes much time for the air<br>
bleeding of the hydraulic master cylinder of the master<br>
cylinder unit.<br>

As shown in Fig. 2, a synchronizing brake device 50 for a vehicle is configured by the hydraulic brake (the first brake) 51 provided to the front wheel 37, a mechanical brake (a second brake) 52 provided to the rear wheel 41 (see Fig. 1), a synchronizing brake operating lever (a left brake lever) 53 provided to the steering handlebar 35 so as to operate the hydraulic brake 51 and the mechanical brake 52, an independent brake operating<br><br>
lever (a right brake lever) 54   provided to the steering handlebar 35 so as to operate the hydraulic brake 51, a master cylinder unit 70 provided between the hydraulic brake 51 and the mechanical brake 52 so as to selectively operate the hydraulic brake 51 and the mechanical brake 52, a master cylinder 56 on the side of the handlebar which is provided to the steering handlebar 35, which is operated by the independent brake operating lever 54 and which operates only the hydraulic brake 51, synchronizing brake control force transmitting means (wire on the side of the operating lever) 57 one end 57a of which is connected to the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 and the other end 57b of which is connected to the side of the master cylinder unit 70, mechanical brake control force transmitting means (wire on the side of the brake) 58 one end 58a of which is connected to the mechanical brake 52 and the other end 58b of which is connected to the side of the master cylinder unit 70, brake lock means 59 that holds the mechanical brake 52 in an operated condition independent of the synchronizing brake operating lever 53, a hydraulic pipe 61 on the side of the unit that connects the master cylinder unit 70 and the hydraulic brake 51 and a hydraulic pipe 62 on the side of the handlebar that connects the master cylinder 56 on the side of the handlebar and the hydraulic brake 51. [0025]<br>
The synchronizing brake operating lever (the left brake lever) 53 is turnably attached to a handlebar holder<br><br>
Ill of the steering handlebar 35 via a supporting shaft 112 and one end 57a of the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means (the wire on the side of the operating lever) 57 is attached to it.<br>
The hydraulic brake 51 is provided with a first joint 63 to which the hydraulic pipe 61 on the side of the unit is connected and a second joint 64 to which the hydraulic pipe 62 on the side of the handlebar is connected.  The first and second joints 63, 64 are an independent hydraulic system. [0026]<br>
The brake lock means 59 is provided with a brake lock operating member (not shown) that operates a brake lock and brake lock control force transmitting means 114 one end 114a of which is connected to the brake lock operating member and the other end 114b of which is connected to a brake lock connecting part 87 of an equalizer 75 shown in Fig. 5. [0027]<br>
Next, an  outline of the operation of the synchronizing brake device 50 for a vehicle will be described.<br>
First, oil is supplied to the hydraulic brake 51 from the master cylinder 56 on the side of the handlebar via the pipe 62 on the side of the handlebar by operating the independent brake operating lever 54, and the hydraulic brake 51 is converted to a condition in which the brake is turned on.  As the synchronizing brake operating lever 53<br><br>
is not operated, the master cylinder unit 70 remains an initial state and the mechanical brake 52 also remains a condition in which the brake is turned off. [0028]<br>
Next, when the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 is operated, the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means (the wire on the side of the operating lever) 57 is pulled, the mechanical brake control force transmitting means (the wire on the side of the brake) 58 is pulled, and the mechanical brake 52 is converted to a weakly braked condition. [0029]<br>
Further, when the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 is operated, the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means (the wire on the side of the operating lever) 57 is further pulled, the hydraulic brake 51 is converted to the condition in which the brake is turned on, the mechanical brake control force transmitting means (the wire on the side of the brake) 58 is also further pulled, and the mechanical brake 52 is converted .to a strongly braked condition. [0030]<br>
Besides, the mechanical brake 52 can be held in an operated condition by operating the brake lock means 59. [0031]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 to Fig. 7, the master cylinder unit 70 is configured by a cylinder block 71 as a body, a hydraulic master cylinder 72 provided in a vertical<br><br>
direction of the cylinder block 71, a lever mechanism (first brake control force transmitting means) 79 that drives a piston 73 of the hydraulic master cylinder 72, the equalizer 75 which is coupled to the lever mechanism 79 and which enables the hydraulic brake 51 and the mechanical brake 52 to be operated according to the operation of the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 (see Fig. 2) and a delay spring 77 which is provided between the cylinder block 71 and the lever mechanism 79, which delays the motion of the lever mechanism 79 and which resets the lever mechanism 79 to an initial condition.  The hydraulic master cylinder 72 is provided with the slidable piston 73. [0032]<br>
The cylinder block 71 is provided with a spring bracket 71a that bears one end of the delay spring 77.  The piston 73 is provided with a return spring 75 pressed toward the downside of the hydraulic master cylinder 72.<br>
Hydraulic brake control force transmitting means 81 is formed by the lever mechanism 79, the hydraulic master cylinder 72 and the hydraulic pipe 61 on the side of the unit. [0033]<br>
The lever mechanism (the first brake control force transmitting means) 79 is configured by a synchronizing turning lever (a synchronizing member) 74 turnably attached to the cylinder block 71 via a shaft member 83 and a knocker 78 turnably attached coaxially with the synchronizing turning lever 74, that is, to the cylinder<br><br>
block 71 via the shaft member 83.<br>
The shaft member 83 is a screw for fastening the synchronizing turning lever 74 and the knocker 78 to the cylinder block 71 coaxially and turnably as shov^n in Fig. 7. [0034]<br>
As shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9(a) to Fig. 9(c), in the equalizer 75, a hydraulic brake connecting part 84 for connecting the hydraulic brake control force traiTsmitting means 81, a synchronizing brake connecting part 85 for connecting the other end 57b of the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means 57, a mechanical brake connecting part 86 for connecting the other end 58b of the mechanical brake control force transmitting means 58 and the brake lock connecting part 87 to which the other end 114b of the brake lock control force transmitting means 114 of the brake lock means 59 (see Fig. 2) is connected are formed in this order from the hydraulic brake connecting part 84, and the equalizer is turnably coupled to the synchronizing turning lever 74 using the hydraulic brake connecting part 84 as a fulcrum. [0035]<br>
The synchronizing brake connecting part 85 and the brake lock connecting part 87 are formed in the shape of an elongate hole.  It can be said that the brake lock connecting part 87 is formed outside the mechanical brake connecting part 86 of the equalizer 75. [0036]<br>
That is, as the other end 57b of the synchronizing<br><br>
brake control force transmitting means 57 is slidably connected to the equalizer 75 and the other end 114b of the brake lock control force transmitting means 114 is slidably connected to the equalizer 75, a load can be prevented from being applied by the other control force transmitting means when either of the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means 57 or the brake lock control force transmitting means 114 is operated.  As a result, the vain increase of control force can be avoided. [0037]<br>
In the synchronizing turning lever 74, a spring bracket 91 that bears the other end of the delay spring 77, a coupling hole 92 to which the hydraulic brake connecting part 84 of the equalizer 75 is coupled, an application force transmitting part 93 that transmits application force to the knocker 78 and a shaft hole 94 turnably attached to the cylinder block 71 via the shaft member 83 shown in Fig. 7 are formed. [0038]<br>
In the knocker 78, an operating part 95 that operates the piston 73 of the hydraulic master cylinder 72, a touching part 96 touched to the application force transmitting part 93 of the synchronizing turning lever 74, a stopper 97 touched to the cylinder block 71, a knocker operating lever 98 for air bleeding from a hydraulic circuit including the hydraulic master cylinder 72 and a shaft hole 99 turnably attached to the cylinder block 71 via the shaft member 83 shown in Fig. 7 are formed.<br><br>
[0039]<br>
Further, as the knocker 78 has structure that the application force transmitting part 93 of the synchronizing turning lever 74 abuts on the touching part 95 and the stopper 97 abuts on the cylinder block 71 (see Fig. 5), the knocker 78 can be separately turned counterclockwise on page space as shown by an arrow the inside of which is void shown in Fig. 8. [0040]<br>
Next, referring to Figs. 10 to 14, the motion of the master cylinder unit 70 will be described. [0041]<br>
Fig. 10 shows a state of the master cylinder unit 70 in an initial condition, and the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means 57 and the brake lock control force transmitting means 114 which are shown in Fig 2 are not operated. [0042]<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, when the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 shown in Fig. 2 is operated, the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means 57 is pulled as shown by an arrow bl, the equalizer 75 is turned with the hydraulic brake connecting part 84 in the center as shown by an arrow b2, the mechanical brake control force transmitting means 58 is pulled as shown by an arrow b3, and the mechanical brake 52 (see Fig. 2) is converted to the weakly braked condition. [0043]<br><br>
In this case, as the synchronizing turning lever 74 of the lever mechanism 79 is pressed by the delay spring 77, the initial condition can be maintained.  As a result, as no oil is supplied to the hydraulic brake 51 shown in Fig. 2 from the hydraulic master cylinder 72, a condition in which the brake is turned off can be maintained. [0044]<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, when the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 shown in Fig. 2 is further operated, the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means 57 is pulled as shown by an arrow b4, the equalizer 75 is turned with the hydraulic brake connecting part 84 in the center as shown by an arrow b5, the mechanical brake control force transmitting means 58 is pulled as shown by an arrow b6, and the mechanical brake 52 is converted to a strongly braked condition. [0045]<br>
The master cylinder unit 70 operates the brake lock control force transmitting means 114 shown in Fig. 2, however, this condition is the same as a condition when the brake lock means 59 is operated.  The synchronizing turning lever 74 and the knocker 78 of the lever mechanism 79 are kept in the initial condition. [0046]<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, when the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 is fully operated, the synchronizing brake control force transmitting means 57 is pulled as shown by an arrow b7, the equalizer 75 is moved<br><br>
substantially in parallel upward, the synchronizing turning lever 74 and the knocker 78 are turned as shown by an arrow b8 with the shaft member 83 in the center, the operating part 95 of the knocker 78 presses the piston 73 of the hydraulic master cylinder 72 as shown by an arrow b9, oil is supplied to the hydraulic brake 51 through the pipe 61 on the side of the unit, and the hydraulic brake 51 (see Fig. 2) is converted to the condition in which the brake is turned on. [0047]<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the knocker 78 can be separately turned with the shaft member 83 in the center as shown by an arrow bll by pressing the knocker operating lever 98 of the knocker 78 as shown by an arrow 10, the operating part 95 of the knocker 78 presses the piston 73 of the hydraulic master cylinder 72 as shown by an arrow bl2, and air in the whole hydraulic circuit including the hydraulic master cylinder 72, the pipe 61 on the side of the unit and the hydraulic brake 51 (see Fig. 2) can be bled. [0048]<br>
That is, the knocker 78 is provided with the knocker operating lever 98 that can press the hydraulic master cylinder 72 by directly operating the knocker operating lever without depending upon the synchronizing member 74 in the synchronizing brake device 50 for a vehicle provided with the first brake 51, the second brake 52, the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 that synchronizes and operates the first brake 51 and the second brake 52,<br><br>
the equalizer 75 that distributes the control force of the synchronizing brake operating lever 53 to the first brake 51 and the second brake 52, the hydraulic master cylinder 72 that generates oil pressure for operating the first brake 51 and the first brake control force transmitting means (the lever mechanism) 79 configured by the synchronizing member (the synchronizing turning lever) 74 which transmits the control force from the equalizer 75 to the hydraulic master cylinder 72 and which is operated by the equalizer 75 and the knocker 78 that presses the hydraulic master cylinder 72 by the operation of the synchronizing member 14. [0049]<br>
As the knocker operating lever 98 that can press the hydraulic master cylinder 72 by directly operating the knocker operating lever without depending upon the synchronizing member 74 is provided to the knocker 78, the air bleeding of the hydraulic master cylinder 72 can be facilitated and time required for air bleeding can be reduced. [0050]<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, in a knocker 181, an insertion hole 182 into which a tool (a rod) 183 for the air bleeding of a hydraulic master cylinder 72 is inserted is formed. [0051]<br>
Detailedly, as the knocker 181 presses the hydraulic master cylinder 72 by being turned and the insertion hole 182 for operating the knocker 181 by inserting the tool 183<br><br>
and turning the tool 183 is provided to a socket 184, an operating load is reduced because the tool 183 has only to be inserted and turned. [0052]<br>
That is, as the insertion hole 182 into which the tool (the rod) 183 for the air bleeding of the hydraulic master cylinder is inserted is formed in the knocker 181, the knocker 181 can be formed in a compact shape and the layout of a master cylinder unit can be enhanced. [0053]<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, in a knocker 191, a socket 192 which receives an end of a screwdriver (a tool) 193 for the air bleeding of a hydraulic master cylinder is formed.<br>
As the socket 192 for the tool 193 is provided to the knocker 191, the knocker 191 can be operated via the tool 193. [0054]<br>
That is, as the socket 192 that receives the end of the screwdriver 193 is formed for the air bleeding of the hydraulic master cylinder in the knocker 191, the air bleeding of the hydraulic master cylinder can be executed by the tool such as the screwdriver 193 and the maintainability of the master cylinder unit can be enhanced [0055]<br>
The knocker 191 can be operated from a remote position.  As a result, another part can be arranged around the knocker 191 and a degree of freedom in design can be enhanced.<br><br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
[0056]<br>
A master cylinder unit 200 in another embodiment in which the lever mechanism 79 of the master cylinder unit 70 shown in Fig. 5 is replaced with a lever mechanism 209 is a unit having the substantially same configuration as the master cylinder unit shown in Fig. 5.<br>

[0057]<br>
The lever mechanism (the first brake control force transmitting means) 209 is configured by a synchronizing turning lever (a synchronizing member) 14   turnably attached to the cylinder block 71 via a shaft member 83 and a knocker 208 attached coaxially with the synchronizing turning lever 74, that is, turnably attached to the cylinder block 71 via the shaft member 83. [0058]<br>
As shown in Figs. 18 to 20, in the knocker 208, an operating part 215 that operates the piston 73 of the hydraulic master cylinder 72 (see Fig. 17), a touching part 216 which abuts on a control force transmitting part 93 of the synchronizing turning lever 74, a stopper 217 which<br><br>
abuts on the cylinder block 71, a knocker operating lever 218 that bleeds air in a hydraulic circuit including the hydraulic master cylinder 72 and a shaft hole 219 turnably attached to the cylinder block 71 via the shaft member 83 shown in Fig. 7 are formed. [0059]<br>
When distance from the shaft hole (the fulcrum) 219 to be a turning supporting axis of the knocker 208 to the operating part (the pressure cone apex) 215 that operates the piston 73 is Dl and distance from the shaft hole (the fulcrum) 219 to the knocker operating lever (the point of the lever where force is applied) 218 is D2, D2 &gt; Dl.<br>
Further, in the knocker 208, when the distance Dl is fixed, the distance D2 can be extended to predetermined length outward.  That is, as the point of the lever 218 can be separated from the fulcrum 219, pressure can be reduced. [0060]<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, when the knocker 208 is turned as shown by an arrow a2 with the shaft hole (the fulcrum) 219 in the center by softly pressing the knocker operating lever (the point of the lever) 218 with a finger 221 as shown by an arrow al and the piston 73 of the hydraulic master cylinder 72 is pressed as shown by an arrow a3, air in the whole hydraulic circuit including the hydraulic master cylinder 72, a pipe 61 on the side of the unit and a hydraulic brake 51 (see Fig. 2) can be bled. [0061]<br>
