				<td>Field of The Invention<br>
The present invention is related to the field of medical diagnostic devices for<br>
determining the concentration of chemical and biochemical components (analytes) in<br>
aqueous fluids. Particularly, the present invention is directed to measuring the concentration<br>
of an analyte in, or a property of, a biological fluid such as blood and more particularly<br>
glucose in blood.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The quantification or assay of chemical and/or biochemical constituents within<br>
biological fluids, such as blood, urine, and saliva, and within biological fluid fractions or<br>
derivatives such as blood serum and blood plasma, is of ever increasing importance for medical<br>
diagnosis and treatment, as well as the quantification of exposure to therapeutic drugs,<br>
intoxicants, hazardous chemicals, and the like. One such common application is the<br>
measurement of blood glucose levels in diabetics.<br>
Widely accepted assays involve measuring a change in a physical characteristic of the<br>
fluid being tested or an element of such fluid when exposed to a particular energy source.<br>
These physical characteristics are typically an electrical, magnetic, fluidic, or optical property of<br>
the fluid or a component thereof. For example, with a colorimetric assay system, an optical<br>
property may be monitored wherein a change in light absorption of the fluid can be related to an<br>
analyte concentration in, or a property of, the fluid.<br>
To carry out the assays, a disposable test strip, pad, or the like, is employed in<br>
conjunction with a meter. A sample of the biological fluid to be tested is provided. When<br>
the biological fluid is blood, a sample is typically acquired by means of a finger stick. The<br>
fluid sample is then deposited in a designated measurement area of the test strip, which<br>
contains reagents selected for the particular assay being conducted. The test strip, or at least<br>
a portion thereof, is placed in a receptacle area or test strip holder within the meter. The<br>
meter is capable of receiving a signal originating in a measurement area of the test strip and<br>
determining the existence and/or concentration of the constituent or analyte of interest.<br>
Examples of assay systems that employ these types of disposable test strips and meters may<br>
be found in U.S. Application Serial Nos. 09/333765, filed June 15, 1999, and 09/356248,<br>
filed July 16, 1999; and in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,935,346, 5,049,487, 5,304,468 and 5,563,042,<br>
the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Often, the measurement area of the test strip is defined by a small aperture within the<br>
surface of the test strip. Placed over and covering the aperture on one side of the test strip is<br>
a hydrophilic material, e.g., a membrane, matrix, layer, or the like, containing reagent(s)<br>
suitable for determining the existence and/or the concentration of the particular analyte of<br>
interest. The sampled fluid is deposited on the opposite side of the test strip within the<br>
aperture whereby the fluid is then absorbed into the hydrophilic matrix. Such a test strip<br>
configuration is used, for example, in colorimetric measurement systems; see, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,563,042. Such systems employ meters, such as a diffuse reflectance<br>
spectrophotometer with accompanying software, which can be made to automatically<br>
transmit a light source at a particular wavelength and then read reflectance, of the test sample<br>
at certain points in time, and, using calibration factors, determine the concentration of<br>
analyte in the sampled fluid.<br>
In order to obtain an accurate measurement of the fluid sample deposited within the<br>
aperture, it is necessary to properly position the test strip within the test strip holder and<br>
aligned the aperture of the test strip with the light source, typically a high-intensity light<br>
emitting diode (LED), within the meter. Improper positioning of the test strip can result, for<br>
example, from a slight rebound of the test strip as its distal or insertion end is caused to<br>
contact the edge of the strip holder. Also, some shifting or slipping of the test strip may<br>
occur after it has been placed within the meter.<br>
To facilitate proper positioning an alignment of the test strip within the test strip<br>
holder, a notch or a cut-out is formed within an edge of a test strip which is to be aligned<br>
with a corresponding or mating alignment pin within the inner edge of the test strip holder.<br>
This has not been completely successful as the strip is still able, to some degree, to shift from<br>
side-to-side when the strip is not fully inserted. Such movement or "play" in the position of<br>
the test strip increases the likelihood that the test strip will be improperly or not completely<br>
inserted or misaligned within the meter. As a result of this misalignment, the measurement<br>
aperture of the test strip may not be. centered with respect to the light source, which may then<br>
result in an incorrect measurement.<br>
Often, to compensate for this likelihood of misalignment and the resulting incorrect<br>
measurement, a larger aperture requiring a greater volume of the biological fluid, e.g., blood,<br>
being tested is used so as to provide a larger measurement area within the test strip. A<br>
disadvantage of using a greater volume of sampled fluid, blood in particular, to saturate this<br>
area of exposed hydrophilic matrix, is the need to draw a greater volume of blood<br>
sample from the patient. This requires greater volume of sampled fluid requires use of<br>
blood sample size which is rather large for a typical finger stick, thus necessitating use<br>
of a larger diameter needle and/or deeper penetration into the skin. These factors can<br>
increase the discomfort and pain felt by the patient, and may be difficult to achieve for<br>
those individuals whose capillary blood does not readily express. As this sampling<br>
process may be repeated frequently within a single day, for many diabetics, an increase<br>
in pah quickly becomes less tolerable or intolerable all together.<br>
As such, there is a discontinuing need for a test strip for use is analyte<br>
concentration measurement that is easy to insert into and self-aligning within a meter,<br>
highly resistant to rebounding upon insertion and to movement once operatively placed<br>
within the meter, and minimizes the volume of the sample of biological fluid that is<br>
necessary to ensure an accurate measurement.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to fluid sampling and analyte measurement<br>
devices, instrumentation, systems and kits, as well as methods for using the same,<br>
which improve upon the prior art. More particularly, test strips for holding a sampled<br>
fluid for measurement by a meter or an associated test strip holder are provided. The<br>
subject test strips may be provided in conjunction with a measurement instrument, i.e.,<br>
an analyte measurement meter, an analyte measurement system, a kit for analyte<br>
measurement and/or accessory devices.<br>
The subject test strips are configured for insertion into a measurement<br>
instrument or a test strip holder within a measurement instrument. In many<br>
embodiments, the subject test strips are in the form of a thin, flat strip defining a<br>
longitudinal axis, and include a distal edge substantially transverse to the longitudinal<br>
axis and an alignment notch formed in the distal edge for engagement with an<br>
alignment member or pin within the test strip holder of the meter or the meter itself.<br>
The alignment notch has opposing edges wherein at least a portion of these edges is<br>
substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the test strip. The test strips further<br>
Include an aperture for receiving a volume of a fluid sample that is less than that<br>
required by prior art devices.<br>
The subject test strips may include a support member and a sampie-absorbing<br>
member. The above-mentioned notch and aperture of the test strips are features of the<br>
support member. Affixed to the bottom surface of the support member is a sample-<br>
absorbing member in the form of a pad which covers the aperture. The pad is made of a<br>
hydrophilic material and, as such, absorbs the fluid sample deposited on the aperture. A<br>
reagent material may be contained within the pad for facilitating the measurement of<br>
the analyte targeted for measurement.<br>
These and other features of the invention will become apparent to those persons<br>
skilled in the art upon reading the details of the present invention as more fully<br>
described below.<br>

Overview<br>
As summarized above, the subject invention provides an improved test strip for use<br>
with a measurement apparatus, e.g., an analyte measuring meter, to determine the existence<br>
and/or concentration level of analyte present in a sample of fluid. The subject test strip is<br>
particularly suitable for use with a photometric instrument or spectrometer for the<br>
determination of the glucose concentration in a sample of whole blood.<br>
The advantages of the present invention will be better understood in the context of<br>
the following comparison with the exemplary prior art test strip of Figs. 1A and 1B, and the<br>
description of an exemplary embodiment of the test strip of the present invention as<br>
illustrated in Figs. 2A and 2B.<br>
Prior Art Test Strip(s)<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1 A, there is shown a top view of a schematic representation of<br>
one embodiment of a test strip 10 of the prior art operatively engaged with an alignment pin<br>
20, commonly provided on the inside distal edge of a test strip holder (now<br>
shown) or within the inside distal edge of a test strip receiving area within the<br>
meter itself (not shown) for facilitating the alignment of test strip 10 within a<br>
meter (not shown) for measurement of an analyte of interest. Such a test strip<br>
10 is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,563,042.<br>
As is more clearly viewed in Figure 1B, test strip 10 includes a support member<br>
12, typically made of a plastic material or the like, by which strip 10 can be held.<br>
Support member 12 has length and width dimensions which are suitable for use<br>
with the test strip holder being used. Typically, the length dimension is in the<br>
range from about 15 to 60 mm, and the width dimension is in the range from<br>
about 5 to 20 mm. Mounted on either the top or bottom side of support member<br>
12 is a reagent element 11 in the form of a membrane, pad or the like, where<br>
matrix pad 11 is typically made of a hydrophilic porous matrix and one or more<br>
reagents impregnated into the pores of the matrix. The one of more reagent(s)<br>
are selected based on the analyte targeted for measurement and, in the case of<br>
photometric measurement, is capable of reacting with the target analyte to<br>
produce a compound that is characteristically absorptive at a wavelength other<br>
than a wavelength at which the assay medium substantially absorbs light.<br>
Reagent element 11 is directly and firmly attached to support member 12 by<br>
means of a non-reactive adhesive 13. Typically, the length dimension reagent<br>
element 11 is in the range from about 5 to 20mm, and the width dimension is in<br>
the range from about 5 to 10 mm.<br>
Aperture 14 is present in support member 12 in a portion of the area to which<br>
reagent pad 11 is attached. Aperture 14 has a circular configuration having a<br>
diameter typically in the range from about 4.5 to 5 mm. Accordingly, a typical<br>
surface area defined by circular aperture 14 ranges from about 15.5 to 20 mm2.<br>
Support member 12 further comprises an alignment notch 15 in the form of a<br>
"V" at distal edge 17 and about the y-axis or vertical centerline 18 (see Figure<br>
1A) of support member 12. More particularly, notch 15 consists of two straight<br>
segments 15a, 15b (one on each side of vertical center line 18), each set at<br>
about a 45° angle with respect to vertical centerline 18 wherein the proximal<br>
ends of segments 15a, 15b intersect at vertical centerline 18, forming the apex<br>
15c of notch 15. The distal ends of legs 15a, 15b terminate, respectively, at<br>
points approximately between about 2 to 4 mm from the strip"s vertical<br>
centerline 18.<br>
The measurement methodology using the above-described test strip 10 involves<br>
the use of a measurement instrument or meter (not shown), such as a diffuse<br>
reflectance spectrophotometer having suitable software, into which test strip 10<br>
is operatively inserted.<br>
Generally, a suitable spectrophotometer includes a light source, such as one or more light<br>
emitting diodes (LED), and a corresponding light reflectance detector that can be adapted to<br>
respectively generate and respond to light having a particular wavelength. Such meters are<br>
commonly known by those skilled in the art of analyte measurement.<br>
When operatively inserted into a test strip holder of a suitable meter or a meter itself<br>
without a holder, test strip 10 is moved in a forward or distal direction until notch 15 is<br>
engaged with alignment pin 20. The assay process begins by providing a sample containing<br>
the analyte to be measured and applying it to aperture 14 of test strip 10. Application of the<br>
sample to aperture 14 may occur either prior to or after insertion of test strip 10 into the test<br>
strip holder. Support member 12 holds reagent pad 11 so that a sample can be applied to<br>
aperture 14 on the top surface of support member 12 while light reflectance is measured<br>
from the bottom surface of support member 12, i.e., on the side of the reagent pad 11<br>
opposite aperture 14. Generally, the normal volume of sample applied is in the range from<br>
about 5 to 50 µl and more typically from about 12 to 30 µl. A beam of light is then<br>
generated and projected onto the reagent pad 11 by a spectrophotometer, and the reflectance<br>
of the light created by the reaction between the reagent and the target analyte within the<br>
sample is then automatically measured at certain times. The meter"s software then<br>
automatically calculates the rate of change of reflectance between measurements, and, using<br>
calibration factors, determines the level of analyte in the sample.<br>
The purpose of the alignment notch and alignment pin arrangement is to facilitate<br>
proper alignment of test strip 10 within the test strip holder such that aperture 14 is<br>
accurately aligned over the meter"s light source. Test strip 10 is allowed some movement<br>
about pin 20 at notch 15 so that the side edges 16 of strip 10 will be properly seated within<br>
the sides of the test strip holder (not shown). This is intended to align aperture 14 over the<br>
light source within the measurement meter; however, it is this movement or lateral "play,"<br>
i.e., side-to-side shifting, of test strip 10 that is often the cause of an improperly aligned test<br>
strip.<br>
Additionally, the V notch configuration has no means for specifically preventing<br>
linear or longitudinal movement along the y-axis 18 of test strip 10 once it is positioned<br>
within the test strip holder. To compensate for such movement, test strip 10 provides a large<br>
aperture 14 requiring a greater volume of sample to be tested. Nonetheless, upon rebound,<br>
aperture 14 may be displaced enough such that none or an insufficient amount of its interior<br>
surface area and the sampled fluid are aligned with the light source, resulting in an<br>
inaccurate measurement reading.<br>
Test Strip(s) of the Present Invention<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2A, there is shown a top view of a schematic representation of<br>
a test device 30 of the present invention. In this embodiment, test device 30 is in the form of<br>
a flat, thin rectangular configuration, i.e., a test strip, defining a longitudinal axis 38,<br>
however, it will be apparent to those of skill in the relevant art that other shapes and/or<br>
configurations are also contemplated by this invention. Here, test strip device 30 is shown<br>
operatively engaged with an alignment pin 40 of a test strip holder (not shown). Test strip<br>
30 has the same or similar general functions and construct as test strip 10 of Figs. 1A and<br>
1B, and is compatible with the types of measurement instruments mentioned herein.<br>
Test strip 30 includes a support member 32 which is adhesively engaged on its<br>
bottom surface with a sample absorbing element 31. Here, support member 32 is illustrated<br>
having a rectangular configuration and sample-absorbing element 31 is in the form of a<br>
rectangular pad positioned with its longitudinal axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of<br>
that of support member 32. Although such rectangular configurations are illustrated, any<br>
configuration compatible with a given measuring instrument is acceptable for test strip 30.<br>
In many embodiments, support member 32 is made of a plastic material including, but not<br>
limited to, polystyrene, polyester, polyethylene. Support member 32 may also be made from<br>
other suitable materials including, laminates, paper and composites, such as recycled<br>
plastics. In many embodiments, sample-absorbing pad 31 is made of a hydrophilic matrix,<br>
typically porous, or another suitable matrix for the analyte(s) targeted for measurement. The<br>
matrix oftentimes contains at least one reagent material selected for such targeted analyte(s).<br>
Support member 32 and reagent pad 31 of test strip 30 may have length, width and thickness<br>
dimensions which are the same as or similar to that of support member 12 and reagent pad<br>
11 of test strip 10 of Figs. 1A and 1B. In certain embodiments, support member 32 has a<br>
length in the range from about 15 to 60 mm, a width in the range from about 5 to 20 mm,<br>
and a thickness in the range from about 0.1 to 2.5 mm. In many embodiments, reagent pad<br>
31 has a length in the range from about 5 to 20 mm, a width in the range from about 5 to 10<br>
mm, and a thickness in the range from about 0.05 to 1 mm.<br>
The geometry and dimensions of both aperture 34 and notch 35 have configurations<br>
which advantageously optimize the use of test strip 30. More particularly, aperture 34 of test<br>
strip 30 has a non-circular shape and a smaller surface area than aperture 14 of prior art test<br>
strip 10. In many embodiments, aperture 34 has a shape or configuration that is substantially<br>
"obround" which comprises two halves of a circle extended apart by a straight midsection.<br>
Other possible configurations of aperture 34 include, but are not limited to, oval,<br>
elliptical or oblong, having a major axial length dimension that is coaxial with the<br>
y-axis vertical centerline 38 of test strip 30.The obround geometry of aperture 34<br>
is more specifically defined by top and bottom half circles or arcs 34a and 34b,<br>
and midsection 36 (Figure 2B). Arcs 34a and 34b are each defined by a base<br>
width in the range from about 3 to 6 mm, more typically in the range from about<br>
3.5 to 4 mm, and by an arc height in the range from about 1.5 to 3 mm, more<br>
typically in the range from about 1.75 to 2 mm. Midsection 36 has the same<br>
width as the same width as the base width of arcs 34a and 34b, and a height<br>
(along y-axis 38) in the range from about 0.1 to 0.2 mm, and more typically<br>
about 0.15 mm. The total y-axis tangent-to-tangent: dimension for aperture 34<br>
equals twice the arc diameter plus the length of midsection 36 and, thus, is in<br>
the range from about 3.1 to 6.2 mm, and more typically from about 3.5 to 4.5<br>
mm. Accordingly, the surface area defined by aperture 34 is in the range from<br>
about 7 to 30 mm2, and more typically in the range from about 10 to 13.5 mm2.<br>
Certain embodiments of the test strips of the present invention have an aperture<br>
surface area preferably no greater than about 15 mm2.<br>
As such, the volume of the fluid sample necessary to provide an accurate<br>
measurement using test strip 30 of the present invention is less that that which<br>
is required when employing a prior art test strip. With the obround configuration<br>
of aperture 34, an amount of sample less than about 35 µl, and more typically<br>
less about 10 µl, and in certain embodiments, less than about 5 µl is required for<br>
an accurate measurement. Therefore, the volume of fluid sample, example<br>
blood, necessary to be drawn from a patient is less than what is conventionally<br>
required. Accordingly, relatively smaller needles, lancets and blood letting<br>
devices of the like may be used for drawing the fluid sample from the patient or<br>
user of the device, thereby minimizing the pain and discomfort experienced by<br>
the patient during the sampling procedure, and minimizing the rate of non-<br>
compliance among patients.<br>
As mentioned above, a test strip may have a tendency to spring back or rebound<br>
in a proximal direction upon contact with the distal end of the test strip holder<br>
when being inserted into the test meter. Such proximal displacement of the test<br>
strip, and of measurement aperture, is such that the aperture"s exposure and<br>
thus the sampled fluid"s exposure, to the light source beam of the meter is<br>
insufficient to provide an accurate measurement reading of the sample deposited<br>
within the aperture. However, with the obround configuration of aperture 34, the<br>
shorter distance between apex 35c to apex 40 of aperture 34, proximal<br>
displacement of test strip 30 within a nominal or typical distance will not limit the<br>
area of aperture 34 exposed 34 exposed to the light source beam. As such, the<br>
extended apex-to-apex distance minimizes the effect of rebounding by test strip<br>
30. Additionally, this feature provides for an increased insertion zone that a<br>
sufficient surface area of aperture 34 is exposed to the measurement source<br>
even when test strip 30 is not fully inserted into the test strip holder or meter.<br>
This in turn facilitates a more accurate measurement of the sample and, over<br>
time, maximizes the repeatability of accurate measurements.<br>
Alignment notch 35 also has a shape and configuration different from that of<br>
corresponding alignment notch 15 of prior art test strip 10. Figure 2B illustrates<br>
an exemplary configuration of notch 35. Notch 35 has opposing edges, one on<br>
each side of centerline 38. preferably, the opposing edges are the same, that is<br>
mirror images of each other, or substantially similar. At least a portion of the<br>
opposing edges of notch 35 is in substantially parallel relation with each other<br>
and with centerline 38. Notch 35 may also include one or more segment pairs in<br>
an angular relation with centerline 38.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of Figures 2A and 2B, notch 35 is shown having<br>
three pairs of opposing edge segments 35a and 35b, 35a" and 35b", 35a" and<br>
35b". However, notch 35 may have more or fewer segment pairs, provided that<br>
the overall configuration of notch 35 provides stability to and substantially<br>
minimizes any shifting or movement of test strip 30 when engaged within the<br>
meter.<br>
Notch 35 consists of a first pair of edge segments 35a, 35b, one on each side of<br>
centerline 38, each set at an angle a with respect of centerline 38. Angle a<br>
preferably ranges from about 30° to 60°, and more typically is about 45° from<br>
centerline 38. Segments 35a, 35b have lengths in the range from about 0.5 to<br>
2.0 mm, and more typically in the range from about 0.7 to 1.25 mm. The<br>
respective distal ends of edge segments 35a, 35b each extend laterally from<br>
centerline 38 a distance preferably in the range from about 2.0 to 3.0 mm, and<br>
more typically in the range from about 2.4 to 2.6 mm. The respective proximal<br>
ends of edge segments 35a, 35b each extend inwardly from the respective distal<br>
ends and extend laterally from centerline 38 a distance preferably in the range<br>
from about 1.0 and 2.0 mm, and more typically in the range from about 1.5 to<br>
1.7 mm.<br>
The second pair of edge segments 35a" and 35b" extend downwardly from the<br>
proximal ends of segments 35a, 35b, respectively, and are substantially parallel<br>
to centerline 38. Segments 35a" and 35b" have lengths preferably distance<br>
preferably in the range from about 0.5 to 2 mm, and more typically in the range<br>
from about 0.9 to 1.1 mm.<br>
The third pair of segments 35a" and 35b" extend inwardly from the proximal ends of<br>
segments 35a", 35b", respectively, each forming an angle (3 with centerline 38. Angle (3<br>
preferably ranges from about 30° to 60°, and more typically is about 45°. The proximal ends<br>
of segments of 35a" and 35b" intersect at centerline 38. Fillets with radii in the range from<br>
about 0.2 to 0.4 mm may be added at each of the segment junctures to facilitate the<br>
manufacturing process.<br>
The configuration of alignment notch 35 overcomes many of the disadvantages of<br>
previous notch designs. In particular, the second pair of segments 35a", 35b" of notch 35,<br>
i.e., the segments that are substantially parallel to centerline 38, act to guide test strip 30 in a<br>
straight insertion path into a test strip holder or meter upon operative engagement between<br>
notch 35 and alignment pin 40. Furthermore, such configuration of notch 35 acts to<br>
minimize the likelihood of lateral movement of the test strip upon insertion into the test strip<br>
holder or meter. Additionally, edge segments 35a", 35b" maintain test strip 30 in a straight<br>
and optimally aligned position within the test strip holder or meter after insertion and during<br>
the testing process by restricting any lateral movement of test strip 30.<br>
System(s) of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention also includes systems for measuring the concentration of at<br>
least one target analyte in a biological fluid sample. The subject systems include at least one<br>
of the subject test strips and a measurement instrument. The measurement instrument may<br>
be any instrument adapted and suitable for measuring a targeted analyte in a fluid sample,<br>
including a physiological or biological fluid sample, such as interstitial fluid, blood, blood<br>
fractions, and the like. The test strips are particularly suitable for use with an optical or<br>
photometric device (e.g., a spectrometer), but the test strips may include components for use<br>
with an electrochemical measurement instrument without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
The measurement meter typically includes a test strip holder into which the test strip<br>
is directly inserted, but the meter need not have such a holder. In either case, the meter has<br>
an alignment pin, either in the strip holder or a test strip receptacle area of the meter. The<br>
alignment notch of the subject test strips has a configuration for engagement with the<br>
alignment pin to ensure proper alignment of the test strip upon insertion. Additionally, this<br>
notch-pin engagement maintains the test strip in a substantially motionless position with<br>
respect to the alignment pin when said test strip is operatively engaged within the test strip<br>
holder or meter, as described above.<br>
Methods of Using the Test Strip(s) of the Present Invention<br>
An exemplary method of the subject invention involves using at least one subject test<br>
device in conjunction with a measurement instrument for measuring the concentration of at<br>
least one constituent in a fluid sample. Also provided by the subject invention are<br>
methods of using the subject devices, i.e., the test strips, to determine the existence and<br>
concentration of chemical and biochemical components (analytes) in aqueous fluids. A<br>
variety of different constituents, e.g., analytes, may be detected and their concentrations may<br>
be determined using the subject test strips, where representative constituents include glucose,<br>
cholesterol, lactate, alcohol, and the like. In many embodiments, the subject methods are<br>
employed to determine the glucose concentration in an aqueous fluid, e.g., a biological fluid.<br>
While in principle the subject methods may be used to determine the concentration of a<br>
constituent in a variety of different biological samples, such as urine, tears, saliva, and the<br>
like, they are particularly suited for use in detecting and determining the concentration of a<br>
constituent in blood or blood fractions and more particularly whole blood.<br>
In practicing the subject methods, the first step is to provide a test device, e.g., a test<br>
strip or the like, defining a longitudinal axis and having a distal edge which is substantially<br>
transverse to the longitudinal axis, an aperture for receiving the fluid sample, as described<br>
above, and an alignment notch formed in the distal edge for engagement with an alignment<br>
member of a measurement instrument, e.g., a pin of a test strip holder or a pin in the<br>
receptacle area of a meter, wherein such an alignment notch has opposing edges where at<br>
least a portion of the opposing edges is in substantially parallel relation to the longitudinal<br>
axis.<br>
Either prior to or after insertion of the subject test strip into a suitable measuring<br>
instrument, a quantity of the biological sample is then applied or introduced to the test strip,<br>
i.e. to the aperture of the test strip. The amount of biological sample, e.g., blood, that is<br>
applied to the test strip may vary, but is generally less than about 5 µl. The sample may be<br>
applied to the test strip using any convenient protocol, where the sample may be injected,<br>
wicked, and the like. In many embodiments, e.g., colorimetric assays, the sample is allowed<br>
to react with the reagent(s) of the test strip to produce a detectable product, as described<br>
above.<br>
Automated meters for measuring the concentration of at least one of the constituents<br>
in a biological sample deposited on the test strip for use with colorimetric assays are well<br>
known in the art, for example see U.S. Patent No. 5,059,395, the disclosure of which is<br>
herein incorporated by reference. The measurement instrument includes an alignment pin<br>
configured for engagement with the alignment notch of the test strip. As mentioned above,<br>
the meter may include a test strip holder into which the test strip is directly inserted, but the<br>
meter need not have such a holder. In either case, the meter includes the alignment pin,<br>
either in a test strip holder or in the meter itself, e.g., in a test strip receptacle area of the<br>
meter. Accordingly, upon insertion of the test strip into the meter, the test strip, and more<br>
specifically the alignment notch of the test strip, is operatively engaged with the alignment<br>
pin of the measuring instrument. Specifically, the alignment pin of the measurement<br>
instrument is operatively engaged between the opposing parallel edges of the test strip. In<br>
many embodiments, the test strip is maintained in a substantially motionless position while it<br>
is operatively engaged with the alignment pin. In other words, undesirable, unintended or<br>
unwanted movement or displacement of the test strip, lateral movement in particular, while<br>
the test strip is engaged with the alignment pin is substantially hindered, minimized or all<br>
together prevented due to the engagement of the notch and pin.<br>
In certain embodiments, the subject methods further include minimizing the effect of<br>
any proximal displacement of the test strip, if such proximal displacement should occur.<br>
Accordingly, in many embodiments, the effect of proximal displacement is minimized by<br>
increasing the insertion zone or area of the test strip, as described above. For example, in<br>
certain embodiments, the insertion zone is increased by extending or lengthening the depth<br>
of the alignment notch, as described above in reference to Fig 2A (i.e., the distance between<br>
the alignment notch apex and the distal edges of the test strip is increased over the prior art)<br>
such that test device aperture is positioned closer to the distal boundary of the meter or the<br>
test strip holder. As such, the aperture is more likely to remain within the measurement area,<br>
i.e., the area in which the meter"s light source is targeted, if such rebounding or proximal<br>
displacement (within a nominal or typical range) of test device does occur. In other<br>
embodiments, the insertion zone is increased by decreasing the insertion gap, as described<br>
above. Regardless of the way in which the insertion zone is increased, the result of such<br>
increase minimizes the effect of any proximal displacement the test strip may have.<br>
Following insertion and operative engagement of the test strip within the<br>
measurement instrument, measurements are made. More specifically, the detectable product<br>
produced by the interaction of the biological sample and at least one reagent of the test strip<br>
is detected and related to the amount of constituent, e.g., analyte, in the sample by the<br>
measurement instrument.<br>
Additionally, the subject methods may further include repeating the above-described<br>
method for a plurality of measurements of one or more samples of fluid, wherein the<br>
measurement results are more accurate and have better repeatability over the prior art.<br>
Kits<br>
Also provided by the subject invention are kits for use in practicing the subject<br>
methods. The kits of the subject invention include at least one subject test device or test<br>
strip. The kits may also include a measurement instrumentation that may be used with<br>
reusable or disposable test devices. Certain kits may include various test devices or test<br>
strips having different sizes and/or containing the same or different reagents. Additionally,<br>
the kits many include certain accessories such as a means for sampling the fluid to be tested.<br>
For example, the means for sampling may include, but is not limited to, a needle, lancet or<br>
blood letting device for drawing from less than about 5 µl to about 10 µl of blood from a<br>
patient. Finally, the kits preferably include instructions for using the subject devices and<br>
instrumentation in the determination of an analyte concentration in a fluid sample. The<br>
instructions for use may include, for example, language instructing the user of the kit to<br>
apply less than about 35 µl, less than about 10 µl, or less than about 5 µl of the fluid sample<br>
to the test device. These instructions may be present on one or more of the packaging, a<br>
label insert, or containers present in the kits, and the like.<br>
It is evident from the above description that the features of the subject test strip<br>
overcome many of the disadvantages of prior art test strips including, but not limited to,<br>
minimizing the movement of the test strip during and after insertion within a test strip<br>
holder, minimizing the detrimental effects of rebound and a lack of full insertion of the test<br>
strip if such should occur, and decreasing the volume of fluid sample needed for an accurate<br>
measurement. Other advantages of the subject test strip are the reduction in pain<br>
experienced by a patient as a result of requiring a lower sample volume and ensuring greater<br>
repeatability in the measurement process. As such, the subject invention represents a<br>
significant contribution to the field.<br>
The subject invention is shown and described herein in what is considered to be the<br>
most practical, and preferred embodiments. It is recognized, however, that departures may<br>
be made there from, which are within the scope of the invention, and that obvious<br>
modifications will occur to one skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure.<br>
Although the present invention is useful for many applications, the sampling of<br>
various fluids and the detection of many types of constituents, the invention has been<br>
described primarily in the context of the detection of analytes in biological fluid, and as<br>
being particularly useful for the detection of glucose in blood. Thus, the specific devices and<br>
methods disclosed and the applications, biological fluids and constituents discussed herein<br>
are considered to be illustrative and not restrictive. Modifications that come within the<br>
meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed concepts, such as those that would readily<br>
occur to one skilled in the relevant art, are intended to be included within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
