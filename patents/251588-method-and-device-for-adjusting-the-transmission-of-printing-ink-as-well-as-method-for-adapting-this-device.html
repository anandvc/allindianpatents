Method and Device for Adjusting the Transmission of Printing Ink as well as Method for Using this Device<br>
The invention pertains to a method and device for adjusting the transmission of printing ink according to the introduction part of claim I or 25, as well as a method for using this device according to the introductory part of claim 53.<br>
from the documents WO 03/045694 Al and WO 03/045695 Al we know about methods in which through tempering of a rotating component of a printing mechanism working together with the printing ink. an easy flow of the ink on the rotating component can be kept largely constant in a temperature range of 22°C to 50°C, whereby the easy flow of ink depends on the temperature on the jacket surface of the rotating component and its production speed. This application is particular!) found in waterless printing mechanisms, preferably in the printing mechanism for newspaper printing.<br>
I he document 1 P 0 652 101 Al reveals a printing mechanism for waterless offset printing  with a regulating unit with several regulators, which for avoiding build-up of ink on a transmission cylinder of a printing mechanism regulate, depending on the fluctuation of a form cylinder of a printing mechanism allocated to the transmission cylinder or with a thermo-sensor on the transmission cylinder or an ink r ofling cylinder of a inking mechanism allocated to the form cylinder, the determined temperature from a rated value with the help of a regulating valve for regulating a co ofing agent fed to the respective cylinder, e.g. water. W while printing, with the help of the regulated co ofing agent quantity it should be possible to maintain a constant temperature of the print form arranged on the form cylinder, e.g. in a temperature range of 28°C to 30°C The temperature of the transmission cylinder should be maintained at approx. 3 1°C to 35°C and the temperature of the inking mechanism between 25 and 270C. By feeding the co ofing agent quantity there is also the possibility of preheating  of the printing mechanism, so that cracking of the printing ink at the beginning of printing can be avoided on account of accumulation of paper particles in the printing mechanism, wherein a temperature flow of the co ofing agent for pre-heating can be regulated according to a temperature-time-graph fed to the storage unit accommodated in the regulating unit<br><br>
2<br>
from the document DF- 197 36 339 A1/B4 we know of a tempering device in a printing mechanism. whereby through tempering the rhe ofogical properties of the printing ink can be influenced. e.g. its v iscosity or easy flow. 1 he allied printing machine with a form cylinder has a short inking mechanism with an ink well, a screen r ofler and an inking r ofler. At least one of the inking mechanism r oflers or the form cylinders can be tempered by the tempering unit 1 he tempering lakes place by co ofing or heating either from the jacket surface of the inking mechanism r oflers or the form cylinder or in the interior of the inking mechanism r oflers or the form cylinder. Additionally, also the ink well can be tempered and particular!) also the wipers for wiping excess ink from the screen r oflers. The quantity of ink transmitted to the form cylinder can be regulated by means of a regulating cycle, whereby the optical densiu measured on the printing substance serves as signal parameter, on the basis of which the regulators allocated to the tempering unit regulate their temperature.<br>
f rom the document DF 101 43 827 Al we know of a method for contr ofling the medium quantity that can be transmitted by a screen r ofler of a printing machine on to a r ofler in contact with the screen r ofler, especially quantity of ink or lacquer, by influencing a circumference speed difference between screen r ofler and r ofler, whereby the circumference speed difference is contr ofled with respect to the printing speed of the printing machine in such a way. that the printed medium density remains constant or almost constant in a wide range of printing speed, it can be foreseen that the printed medium density is increased by increasing the screen r ofler temperature, or that the printed medium density is reduced on reducing the screen r ofler temperature. The printed medium density is respectively the optical density revealed by a printed image transmitted on to a printing substance and not the substance density of the print medium.<br>
In the document DF 44 3 I 188 Al a print form of a printing mechanism for waterless offset printing is co ofed with the help of a co ofing device to approx. 28 to 30°C.<br>
from the document DF 41 08 883 Al we know of a printing device with a counter pressure cy linder and with an inking mechanism with at least one r ofler for transmitting ink on a substrate, whereby the substrate runs through between the counter pressure cylinder and the inking mechanism and/or the inking mechanism is divided in axial direction into several<br><br>
thermal zones, where the /ones have individually contr oflable tempering devices for altering there is costly of the ink in the respective zone.<br>
from the document DF 39 04 854 C1 it is known that the rotation speed of the cylinder of the priming mechanism, the inking mechanism and the damping device have an influence on the inking mechanism temperature.<br>
t he document Dh-OS 19 53 590 presents a printing mechanism with an inking mechanism and a damping device that can be tempered with the help of a tempering unit. A rated value for the temperature can be determined in relationship to influence parameters, e.g. the printing speed. before starling of the printing process with the help of trial print, or can be set with the help of a fable. An advantageous upper limit of the temperature of the printing ink is given with room temperature.<br>
 SO 12634 dated 15.1 I.I 996 describes in details the easy flow of a printing ink and ISO<br>
1 264 I dated 01.12 I 996 describes in details the viscosity of a printing ink as well as details of<br>
measuring methods.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create a method and a device for adjusting the transmission of printing ink. as well as a method for using this device.<br>
this task is fulfilled with the help of the invention through the features given in claim I,<br>
"25or 53.<br>
t he advantages that can be achieved with the invention are, on the one hand, that specific Influence is exercised, i.e. selectively and according to requirement, on different parameters of a printing ink. particularly its viscosity and easy flow, with the help of an adjustable tempering unit, in order to adapt the transportation of the printing ink to the operating condition existing in the printing machine and also to avoid stretching and/or toning of the printing ink. in that for example a conveying rate of a r ofler sourcing printing ink from a reservoir and transmitting it to an adjacent rotation body, for example a screen r ofler, is kept almost constant, so that on increasing the production speed of the printing machine in spite of a decrease in the capacity of the screen r ofler for transmitting printing ink as a result of an increasing incomplete employing of its cups an almost uniform ink quantity is conveyed to the<br><br>
4<br>
printing substance, and on the other hand. by adjusting the temperature on the jacket surface of particularly the formed cylinder in relation to the production speed of the printing machine, easy flow of the ink transported from the form cylinder can be maintained in a suitable range wise for the printing process, so that especially cracking of the ink on the surface of the printing substance can he avoided. The ink is adapted to the actual printing process in relationship to the production speed of the printing machine with respect to its fission capacity and adhesion capacity by appropriate adjustment of its temperature, whereby adjustment of its temperature indirectly takes place by adjusting the temperature on the jacket surface of a rotation body guiding this printing ink. In order to avoid wastage as a result of unsuitable temperature-dependent properties of the printed ink, in case of an intended alteration in production speed of the printing machine, the different time parameters for conducting the adaptation of temperature of the ink and for conducting the adaptation of the production speed of the printing machine should be taken into account. There is also the possibility of manually altering a machine setting within certain limits and thus carrying out fine-tuning and of producing a good quality for the print product. All these measures contribute towards maintaining a high quality level of a print product produced with the printing machine in spite of alteration of the production speed of the printing machine.<br>
Design examples of the invention are shown in the drawing and are described in more details<br>
below.<br>

F ig i A highly simplified depiction of four printing mechanisms of an offset rotor printing<br>
machine arranged in series:<br>

FIG. 1 shows in a highly simplified depiction four printing mechanisms 01: 02; 03: 04  of an offset motor printing machine arranged in series, respectively with a form cylinder 06; 076;<br><br>
5<br>
OS. 09. a transmission. cylinder 11: 12: 13: 14 and a counter pressure 16; 17: 18; 19. whereby for producing prim product printed on both sides each counter pressure cylinder 16; 17; 18: 19 is preferably similarly designed as a transmission cylinder, which again works together with a form cylinder allocated to it (not shown). A print carrier 21. e.g. a printed sheet 21 or a material web2l. preferablv a paper web 21. is guided through during a production of the printing machine respectively between the transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13: 14 and the counter pressure cylinder 16: 17; 18: 19 and printed at least one printed image on it. It is insignificant for the invention whether the printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04 are arranged in such a way that the print carrier 21 is guided horizontally or vertically through the printing machine.<br>
On the printing machine, preferably at the exit of the last printing mechanism 04 of the printing machine in transportation direction of the print carrier 21 an image sensor 22, e.g. a c ofour camera 22. preferably a digital semiconductor camera 22 with at least one CCD-chip. can be arranged with its image scanning region directly pointed on to the print carrier 21, whereby the image scanning region of the image sensor 22 captures the entire width of the print carrier 2 I. w hereby the width of the print carrier 21 stretches transverse to its transportation direction through the printing machine. The image sensor 22 thus records an electronically usable image of the entire width of the printed paper web 21. whereby along the w idth  of the paper web 21 at least one printed image is imposed on the print carrier 21. I he image sensor 22 is designed for example as a fiat camera 22.<br>
T he image sensor 22 transmits the data correlated to the scanned image to a suitable evaluation unit 23. especially a programme-contr ofled electronic computing unit 23 that is arranged in a conducting stand belonging to the printing machine. Parameters relevant for the printing process can be contr ofled by analysing and evaluating the scanned image in the elluation unit and. if required, automatically corrected in a programme-contr ofled manner by programmes running in the evaluation unit 23. The evaluation and correction of all parameters of a printing process takes place practically simultaneously with the help of the same evaluation unit 2 5. Particularly the image scanned by the image sensor 22 during a running production of a printing machine and passed on to the evaluation unit 23 in the form of data is evaluated to see whether the printed image scanned by the image and evaluated shows any change in tonality, especially an increase in tonality, with respect to the previously scanned and evaluated printed image, i.e. an actually scanned image is checked in the running<br><br>
6<br>
printing process in comparison to a reference image. If the result of the text shows an alteration of tonality. i.e. generally a print-technically unavoidable increase in tonality, then the dosage and/or the feeding of ink in the printing machine is altered by a first setting command coming from the evaluation unit 23 and guided through a data line 24 to at least one  of the printing mechanisms 01; 02: 03: 04. so that the tonality variation for a subsequent application  of ink is minimum. After regulation of the ink density carried out b\ altering the dosage and/or the Iced of printing ink. an image  of flowing the actually checked image conforms to a previously checked image of a printed image, i.e. to a reference image. Control and regulation of the tonality variation is important in order to maintain c of our balance or grey balance in the printing process and to keep the  of our impression of the produced print product as constant as possible if required within permissible tolerance limits . which constitute an important qualitv feature for print products.<br>
Similarly the data generated from the scanning of the printed image and transmitted to the evaluation unit 23 is taken for checking a registration consistency of the printed image impression on the print carrier 21, especially for checking and if required correcting a  of our registration of a printed image printed in multiple  of ours. At least one motor-adjustable register is loreseen in the printing machine, e.g. a circumference register or a page register, if required even a diagonal adjustment for at least one of the form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 with respect to the transmission cylinder II: 12: 13: 14 allocated to it, whereby the register is regulated by at least one second setting command coming from the evaluation unit 23 and forwarded through a data line 26 to at least one of the printing mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04. so that a printed image of lowing the evaluated image gives the highest possible registration precision. An adjustment or shifting of the register is thus calculated by the evaluation unit 23 from the image data provided by the image sensor 22 to the evaluation unit 23. By adjusting or shifting the page register even cross-expansion caused by fan-out can be countered, whereby this cross-expansion occurs especially in printing machine that have a so-called eight-tower structure for its printing mechanism.<br>
1 he printing machine is designed shaft-less. In such a printing machine the form cylinders 06: 07: 08: 00 have individual drives that are mechanically dc-couplcd from the drive of the counter pressure cy linders 16. 17:18:19. so that the phase position or the angle position of the form cylinders 06: 07: 08: 09 can be altered with respect to the counter pressure cylinders I 6: 17: 18: 19 by a corresponding control or regulation of the drive of the form cylinders 06;<br><br>
7<br>
 08: 09. Whenevcr an evaluation of the image scanned from the print carrier 21 by the image sensor 22 considers this to be necessary. The entire image content and not only indiv idually locally limited image elements ofthe print carrier 21, e.g. reference mark or Similar things, thus influences the contr of or regulation of the printing mechanism, especially the dn\e of a form cyllinder 06: 07: 08. 09.<br>
Second command generated by the evaluation unit 23 from the image content ofthe image scanned from the printed image acts on a contr of unit or regulating unit of a provision-regulated electrical motor for rotary drive during printing of at least one ofthe form cylinders 06: 07. 08. 09. the transmission cylinders 11: 12; 13: 14 allocated to it or counter pressure cylinders 16: I 7: 18: 19 I hus at least one of the printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03: 04 ofthe printing machine the drive ofthe form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 or the transmission cylinders 11: 12: 13: 14 allocated to these form cylinders 06: 07; 08: 09 can be contr ofled or regulated by an electrical signal independent ofthe drive ofthe form cylinder 06; 07; 08; 09 or the transmission cylinder 11: 12: 13; 14 allocated to this form cylinder 06; 07: 08; 09 in anther printing mechanism 0 1: 02: 03; 04 ofthe printing machine; especially the mutual angle position or phase position ofthe form cylinders 06; 07; 08; 09 or their allocated transmission cylinders 11:12:13:14 arranged in different printing mechanisms 01: 02; 03: 04 ofthe printing machine and inv ofved in the printing ofthe print product, i.e. the printed image, can be adjusted to a registration suitable for production of a print product by the allied contr of unit be regulating unit. e.g. evaluation unit 23. The electrical motor of a form cylinder 06; 07; 08: 09 is arranged eo-a\ial to the axis ofthe form cylinder 06; 07: 08; 09. whereby the rotor ofthe moior is stiffly connected to its stud ofthe axis ofthe form cylinder 06: 07; 08: 09 in a manner as described lor example in the document DE 43 22 744 A I. The counter pressure c\lmdcr 16: 17; 18: 19 arranged in a different printing mechanism 01; 02; 03: 04 ofthe printing machine can. as described in HP 0 812 683 Al, mechanically be connected to one another In a train  of gears and for example have a common drive, whereby however the form cylinder 06: 07: 08. 09 or the allocated transmitted cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 remain de-coupled with respect to their dri\e from the counter pressure cylinders 16; 17; 18; 19 allocated to them Between the form cylinder 06: 07: 08; 09 and the transmission cylinder 11; 12; 13; 14 allocated to it there tan be a coupling by means of meshed gears, so that the form cylinder 06: 07. 08: 09 and the transmission cylinder 11: 12; 13: 14 allocated to it can be driven by the same drive. The contr of unit or the regulation unit of the drive of at least the form cylinders 06. 07: 08: 09 is for example integrated in the evaluation unit 23.<br><br>
8<br>
Contr of or regulation  of the phase position or the angle position of the form cylinder 06: 07: 08.09 with respect to the counter pressure cylinders 16; 17: 18: 19 takes place with reference<br>
10 a fixed reference setting, so that the form cylinder 06: 07; 08; 09 can have a leading or<br>
lagging rotation with respect to the counter pressure cylinder 16: 17; 18: 19 allocated to it.<br>
whereby the relation  of the rotation of the form cylinder 06; 07: 08; 09 and the counter<br>
pressure cylinder 16: 17: 18: 19 allocated to it is adjusted in relation to the image content of<br>
the image scanned by the image sensor 22 and also f oflowed up by the contr of unit or the<br>
regulating unit of their drives. Also the phase position or the angle position of successive<br>
from cy linclers 06: 07; 08: 09 in the printing process can be contr ofled or regulated in the<br>
same manner with reference to a fixed reference setting, which is particularly important in<br>
multi-c ofoured pruning of a print product printed c ofour-wise in successively arranged<br>
nrintine mechanisms 01: 02: 03: 04 of the printing machine. If from the image scan from the<br>
printed image having several c ofours it is seen that a correction is required for an ink printed<br>
in one of the printing mechanisms 01: 02; 03; 04, then the evaluating unit 23 passes on the<br>
setting command to counter the determined disturbing influence on to the concerned printing<br>
mechanism 01: 02: 03. 04.<br>
11 me adjusting drive to be regulated by the evaluation unit 23 by adjusting command, e.g. the<br>
adjustmg drive for regulating the feeding of printing ink as well as the drive for regulating the<br>
circumference register or the page register are connected in the printing machine to a data<br>
network connected to the evaluation unit 23, then the data line 24; 26 foreseen for<br>
transmitting the first and the second adjusting command is realised by the data network.<br>
checking for tonality variation setting in the printing process and checking for registration consistency arc carried out in the evaluation unit 23 simultaneously in data processing running in parallel branches simultaneously. Both the branches checks/tests are continuously conducted in the running process and that too at the end of the printing process and for each individual produced print sample.<br>
Checking for registration consistency initially referred to conformity in the position of a printed image or setting level between perfect printing and back printing or even between top side and bottom side in the production of both-sided print products. The check however also includes for example checking of the compass, i.e. checking the foreseen precision, individual<br><br>
9<br>
path-c ofours in case  of overprinting for multi-c ofoured printing. Registration precision and compass precision play a very important r ofe in multi-c ofoured printing.<br>
A lighting dev ice 27. e.g,. a Hash bulb 27. is allocated to the image sensor 22 whereby the short Hash from the Hash bulb 27 makes the fast running movement sequences in the printing process appear to be stand-still through a stroboscopic process and thus make them observable lor the human eye IspecialK in a sheet printing machine, scanning of the printed image executed by the image sensor 22 can also takes place in an extension 28 of the printing machine, that is shown in fig. 1 by a dashed depiction of the image sensor 22 and the allied lighting device 27 as a possible option for scanning the printed image behind the last printing mechanism 04 of the concerned print page or is shown at the end of the printing machine. By capable choice of the image sensor 22 and if required the allied lighting device 23, scanning  of the image can be extended or shifted to a visually not visible spectral range, e.g. the mlrarcd or ultravi ofet range. As an alternative to the preferred flat camera 22 with a flash bulb 27.it is also possible to use a cell camera with a permanent lighting.<br>
As each print sample is subjected to a test, in the running printing process a trend for tonality alteration or registration consistency of successively produced print samples can be identified, t he print samples can be classified according to the value determined in the running printing process with respect to its tonality and/or its registration into groups of different quality stages and then marked as rejected sample if they cross a permissible t oferance limit. Rejected samples can be elected in a contr ofled manner by the evaluation unit 23 and in the case  of a sheet printing machine can be deposited in the extension 28 at least on a separate stack 29. f or this purpose, from the evaluation unit 23 evaluating the image there is at least a third ad|uslment command guided through a data line 3 1, e.g. a wastage signal to at least one adjusting drive acting on at least one unit for transportation of the print carrier 21 for sorting the sample flow.<br>
for synchroniing the frequency with which detection of the images of the print carrier 21 takes place, w ilh the transportation speed of the print carrier 21, i.e. the speed for example  of the paper web 2 I. at least one of the print mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04, preferably in the printing mechanism 01; 02: 03: 04 in which detection of the images by the image sensor 22 takes place, a rotation generator 32 is installed, whereby the running rotation generator 32 is at a fixed ratio to a rotation speed of the transmission 11; 12; 13; 14 on which the image<br><br>
10<br>
sensor 22 scans thc images. thc rotation generator 32 gives its output signal 23 and/or also to the image sensor 22 The output signal of the rotation generator 32 is, among other things. used as releaser lor the Hash bulb 27. The image scanned by the image sensor 22 and forwarded to the evaluation unit 23 in the form of a data set is displayed on a monitor of an input and output unit 15 connected to the evaluation unit 23 and having bi-directional data exchange t he input and output unit 33 similarly offers correction possibility for at least one of the mentioned regulations. in that it allows manual input and/or release of at least one adjusting command.<br>
T he evaluation unit 23 has a memory 34 for storing scanned image sequences as well as storing data that arc useful for protoc of and thus for documenting the quality of the print product as well as for statistical analysis of the printing process. It would be advantageous if the evaluation unit 23 can make the data evaluated and/or stored image to a company network through a corresponding network 36.<br>
f or comparison  of data carried out by the evaluation unit 23, which correlate the actually scanned image during a running production of a printing machine, with data of a previously generated image, it can be foreseen that the data of the previously generated image correlate with the image generated in a previous printing sequence of the printing machine, whereby a data processing unit oi the printing pre-stage (not shown) is connected to the evaluation unit 23 and the data of the previously generated image is forwarded to the evaluation unit 23. In this way data of the previously generated image are correlated alternatively or additionally to a data of the image scanned by the image sensor 22 and placed at the disposal of the evaluation unit 23 lor evaluation. 1 he data correlated to the printed image from the previous printing stage form iow profile reference data for contr ofling and regulating the c ofour resistance with respect to data obtained from previously printed images in the running production.<br>
In the printing machine shown, a registration regulation and c ofour regulation is possible on the basis of analysis of the same image scanned in the printed image by the image sensor 23, in that the image of the printed image is evaluated with respect to various parameters relevant for the printing process in a single evaluation unit 23. as well as simultaneous inspection of the printed image for processing the quality of the print product.<br><br>
11<br>
The registration regulation is based on a registration measurement in the printed image. After all the e ofours required in the printed image have printed, the entire printed image is scanned by the camera at the end of the printing machine. In the evaluation unit 23 the scanned printed image is split up into the usual c ofour separations CMYK as used in printing techn ofogy. as well as an analysis of'a suitable printed image segment and a relative position determination of a c ofour separation with respect to a c ofour separation by means of correlation method. With a previously scanned or obtained reference image.<br>
The reference image or reference value for image segment or a printed image mark (desired densin ) is drawn either from the previous printing step, which has the advantage that the reference image is available already in the individual c ofour segment, or a reference image. e.g. a reference sheet having the printed image, is taken for evaluation from an impression of the printed image, w hereby this reference image has to additionally be split into the c ofour separations. This reference sheet is identified after the printed image is manually set in such a way. that all printed c ofours are positioned correctly with respect to one another and hence a proper c ofour registration is set. This thus obtained reference printed image is to be stored for later repetition jobs, so that for a repetition job one can fall back on this earlier scanned relerence image. By accessing the stored reference printed image, the c ofour registration can be automatically adjusted by the evaluation unit 23 without manual intervention, which in case of a repetition job leads to further reduction in wastage.<br>
f rom the reference printed image, characteristics and suitable segments are selected, on the basis of which the positions of individual c ofour segments are determined as reference c ofour segments. t his is the so-called desired position for later registration comparison. This reference image inclusive of c ofour segments and the desired position is stored for example in the storage 34. Selection of the suitable printed image segment can be done manually by the operator or automatical!} by the evaluation unit 23, e.g. for a pre-setting of the desired position. Suitable printed image segments with respect to registration measurements are regions, in which the printed ink to be measured dominates or appears exclusively.<br>
In the continuous printing process, each printed image is scanned with the help of the camera sy stem and split into the c ofour segments CMYK. Within the already fixed suitable printed image segment, the position of individual c ofour segment is now determined. This takes place by comparison with the c ofour segment from the reference printing image by means of a<br><br>
12<br>
correlation method, particularly a cross-correlation method. With the help of the correlation method, the position of the c ofour segment can be determined up to approx. 0.1 pixel of the camera res ofution If lor each printed sheet a stationary registration stage is determined repeatedly then a higher precision of the measured value is ensured by suppressing stochastic<br>
dispersion.<br>
Determination of the position of the individual c ofour segments takes place in web run direction corresponding to the longitudinal registration and in cross direction to the web run direction corresponding to the page registration. The thus obtained position differences arc convened by the evaluation unit 23 to setting command and sent as correction signal to the<br>
adjusting system, i.e to the drive.<br>
In offset printing, special c ofours are not mixed with the standard c ofours, i.e. the scale c ofours CMYK, but arc printed separately. Special c ofours are therefore not measured separate!} Such the region in which the special c ofours arc printed should be fixed. For each of the special c ofours, own suitable regions are fixed in which the position of the c ofour segment is determined in the same way as for the scale c ofours CMYK, i.e. the standard c ofours. The further procedure for registration regulation for special c ofour is identical to the procedure described a lready for standard c ofours.<br>
An advantageous design is described below, in which on the basis of the scanned data for c ofour density and'or spectral analysis, the regulation of the ink feeding is taken up by means of a temperature as guiding parameter that can be set on the jacket surface of the rotation bod} inv ofved in the printing process. Determination of the data can thereby takes place through the entire web width or printing width, merely through one or more printed image segments or through special marks on the printing substance, The ink density corresponds to a layer thickness of the ink applied on the printing substance and can be determined densito-metrically, and that too inline, i.e. in the running printing process, as well as offline, i.e. by means of a measurement on rejected print samples from the running printing process.<br>
As shown in fig. 2. an adjusting device 37 is foreseen, which is fed with a signal with data from the evaluation unit 23. for example, depending on the determined variation of an actually scanned ink density DF from a pro-given desired value of the ink density D2 by the adjusting device 37. a variation of the temperature set on the jacket surface and determined bv<br><br>
13<br>
the adjusting dcvice 7 with the help of one tempering unit 57; 58 of at least one of the . jiaium bodies 13. 17 53: 54 inv ofved in the printing process and transporting the ink. is take, up. With a viewto quick, systematic and hence reproduce-able variation, in the storage arranged in the adjusting device 37 or in the evaluation unit 23 a functional relation between a variation in ink density D1 and D2 and the temperature to be adjusted can be pre-rctained. whereby this functional relation is graphically or electronically fixed in at least a graph, table or in any other suitable form representing the correlation. Kven the adjusting device 37 can be arranged in a guide stand belonging to the printing machine.<br>
t he printing machine shown as example in fig. 2 is particularly designed as a rotor printing machine and has a m inlmg mechanism 41 that has at least a printing device 42, a cylinder 43 carrying a print form I 1. e.g. a printing mechanism 43 designed as form cylinder 43, as well as a counter pressure cy linder 46. The s ofution for printing machines described below for operational modes for a web velocity of more than 10 m/scc. especially greater than or equal to 12 m/scc. is particularly advantageous. Thc print form 44 is preferably designed as print form I I tor flat printing (flat print form 44). particularly for waterless flat printing (waterless flat print lorm 44). I he printing mechanism 41 is designed as printing mechanism 41 for off set printing and has between the form cylinder 43 and the counter pressure cylinder 46. another cylinder 17. e g. a printing mechanism cylinder 47 designed as transmission cylinder t7 w ith a packing on its jacket surface. The transmission cylinder 47 forms along with the inter pressure cy linder 46 in a print-on-position over a printing substance 49. e.g. a printing substance web IV. a printing position 51. The counter pressure cylinder 46 can be another transmission cy linder 16 of another not denoted printing mechanism, or can also be a counter ¦'/ivssiiic L_\ linder 46 not carrying any ink. e.g. a steel cylinder or a satellite cylinder.<br>
The print form 44 can be designed as sleeve-shaped or even as one (or more) print plates 44. that is fastened or suspended with its end in at least one narrow channel not exceeding a width in circumference direction of 3 mm (indicated in fig. 2). Similarly, the packing 48 on the transmission cy linder 47 can be designed sleeve-shaped or even as (at least one) rubber blanket 48 that is similarly fastened and/or clamped in at least one channel. If the rubber blanket 48 is designed as multilayered metal print blanket, then the channel is also designed with the above mentioned maximum width.<br><br>
14<br>
t he printing mechanism 42 has an ink supply unit 52, e.g. an ink tub with a dip r ofler or a after or a chamber w iper with ink feed, as well as at least a r ofler 53 that can be set against the form cylinder in a print-on-position, e.g. an inking r ofler 53. In the shown example, the printing ink is transported by the ink supplying unit 52 over a r ofler 54 designed as screen r ofler 54. the r ofler 53. the form cylinder 43 and the transmission cylinder 47 on to the printing substance 49 c g. in web form or as sheet). There can also be at least one more, e.g a second inking r ofler 53 depicted bv dashed line, working together with the screen r ofler 54 and the form cylinder 43. The r ofler 54, i.e. here the screen r ofler 54, has recesses or cups on its picket surface in order to take ink from a reservoir 61 for the printing ink. e.g. from an ink cartridge 61 containing printing ink. and transported on to an adjacent rotation body 53, e.g. the inking r ofler 53<br>
the priming mechanism 41 is designed as so-called "printing mechanism for waterless flat printing". particularly 'waterless offset print" (dry offset), i.e. in addition to feeding of pruning ink no further feeding of a damping agent for forming "non-printing" regions is required. In this method one can do away with application of a moist film on the print form 44. Which otherw isc in the so-called "wet offset" prevents the non-printing part on the print form 44 from taking up ink. In waterless offset printing this is achieved by using special printing ink and through special design of the surface of the print form 44. Thus for example. a silicon la\er in the waterless offset printing can take over the r ofe of the hydrophilic region ot the wet offset to be coated with the damping agent and prevent the print form 44 from taking up any ink<br>
Generally. the non-print areas and the print areas of the print form 44 are achieved by designing regions with different surface tension with alternate working of the printing ink.<br>
In order to print lone-free, i.e. without the non-print areas also taking up ink, one required a printing ink that is set in its easy flow (measured as tack value), that on the basis of the surface difference between printing and non-printing part on the print form 44, a smooth separation can take place As the non-printing points are preferably designed as silicon layer. for this purpose a printing ink having the higher easy flow as compared to the web offset is required.<br><br>
15<br>
Thc easy flow according to the "r ofler offset print", Walenski 1995. raises a resistance, with which the printing ink of the film division in a r ofler crevice or while transmitting the ink in the print one between cy linder and printing substance, counter-act. As the easy flow of the printing ink values the temperature, in practical operation of the printing machine, the cylinders 43: 17 or the inking device 42 are tempered, especially co ofed, and held at a constant temperature in order to avoid tinting for the changing operation conditions during printing<br>
I lie temperature dependence of rhc ofogical properties, e.g. the viscosity and/or the easy flow. is now brought into consideration for influencing and particularly regulating the printing ink to be transported from the reservoir to the printing substance 49. Instead of (or in addition) mechanical selling members, e.g. opening or shutting of wipers or alteration in speed of lifters or film r oflers. b\ altering the temperature on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43: 47: 53: 54 inv ofved in the printing process, the result of the comparison of the desired ink density2 with the determined actual ink density Dl can be influenced.<br>
Apart from separating printing and non-printing regions, the easy flow of the printing ink however also influences the intensity of cracking during co-acting of an ink-carrying cylinder 43: 47 and the printing substance 49. especially when the printing substance 49 is designed as uncoated and less dense newspaper material with very good soaking properties, i.e. with open pores and very little repelling time, there is increased danger of release of fibre or dust caused by cracking the danger however is also there for lightly coated or light-weight coated paper types used in r ofler offset printing with a coating weight of say 5 20 gm/m2, especially 5- 10 gm/m- or even lesser. Tempering is overall suited for uncoated or coated papers with a coating weight of lesser than 20 gm/m2. For coated papers, tempering of the ink-carrying cy linder 43: 47 is advantageous when it is determined that the coating is "offset" by increasing of easy flow of the paper (at least partly).<br>
in order to keep cracking on the printed substance 49 or build-up of the printing ink on the packiim 48 of the transmission cylinder 47 and/or the print form 44 of the form cylinder 43 as low as possible, the printing ink for the application purpose and the expected operating conditions is produced and used in such a way that it is at the lower limit of the easy flow as far as possible.<br><br>
16<br>
In an extension, one or more of the ink-carrying components, like e.g. in an advantageous design of the printing mechanism cylinder 43 designed as form cylinder 43 as ink-carrying component 43. or-and the printing ink itself, can simultaneously be tempered in relation to the production speed V of the printing machine, for which a correlating signal with the production speed V of the printing machine is tapped on the ink-carrying transmission cylinder 47 with the help  of a sensor, e.g. with a rotation generator (not shown) and set to the adjusting device 47 (shown dashed in fig.2 and/or to the evaluation unit 23. The temperature on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 inv ofved in the printing process, prclerably in the form cylinder 43. is not kept constant here, as is otherwise usual in waterless offset printing, for all production speeds V in a certain temperature range, but reveals for different production speeds V different rated values. The temperature is adjusted with the help of the adjusting device 37 in relation to the production speed V in such a way. that the casy flow of the printing ink for an\ desired production speed V lies within a prc-given window of t oferable tack values. For a higher production speed V. an increased rated value is selected for the temperature of the corresponding component 43 or the printing ink.<br>
One regulation is based on the principle that for the desired, directly next or the actually adjusted production speed V as guiding parameter on account of a systematic allocation of a certain rated value or maximum value for the temperature 43 or the printing ink as initial parameter is foreseen. The rated value or maximum value in both cases represents a default temperature that corresponds in the first case to a temperature to be maintained, and in the second case to an upper limit of a permissible temperature. On the basis ofan inline conducted scanning of the ink density Dl actually applied on the print substance 49 by the printing process, with a photo-electric sensor 56. preferably an image sensor 56. especially a C l U-cameral 56, and comparison of the different scanned values with the rated value foreseen in this printing ink density D2. the temperature is however varied and fine-tuned till an adequate conformity between the actual ink density D1 and the desired ink density D2 is achiev ed.<br>
If there are other conditions, e.g. a printing ink with mainly other properties, especially with respect to its consistency, or a printing substance 49 that has a surface structure different from that of uncoated new paper material and/or has a completely different cracking behaviour. then the valued  of the relationship between the mentioned values can vary significantly. Common is howc\cr the s ofution nevertheless of adjusting the temperature of the form<br><br>
17<br>
cylinder 43 in rclationship of production speed V, and in such a way that in the range of higher production speed V it has a higher rated value or maximum value and for a region of a lower production speed V. In this way cracking between the ink-carrying cylinder 43: 47 and the printing substance 19 is reduced and in the ideal case almost prevented.<br>
The above mentioned relationship between a determined ink density variations and a temperature alteration and/or between temperature on the jacket surface at least one of the rotation body 43; 47; 53; 54 inv ofved in the printing process and the production speed V of the printing machine, can be stored for different printing ink and/or printing substance type, even the printing operation then the specific relationship for the respective printing ink and/or the concerned printing substance is used.<br>
In an advantageous design at least the screen r ofler 54 and the formed cylinder 43 has a tempering device 57: 58 acted upon b) a fluid tempering agent, e.g. water, acting from its interior to its respective jacket surface, whereby the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 with respect to the ink quantity to be transmitted from it and the temperature on the jacket surface of the formed cylinder 43 under consideration of the production speed V of the printing machine for avoiding crack and/or toning is adjusted, preferably contr ofled or regulated. t he adjusting device 37 is designed according to the case in question, whether the process is contr ofled or regulated, as a contr of unit 37 or as a regulating unit 37. In the case  of design as a contr of unit 37 there is no feedback through photo-electric sensor 56 or the signal of data supplied by it<br>
For contr ofling the temperature of the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54. in the fore-filled of production for the interested pairs printing ink/paper of various production speed V that temperature (empirical) is determined, at which the desired ink density can be determined on the product. During regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 the actually adjusted temperature can be determined with the help of at least one of the thermo-sensor 59 arranged on or at least near to the jacket surface to the screen r ofler 54, whose output signal is led to the adjusting device 37 or the evaluating unit 23 and then adjusted afresh if required in relationship to a comparison with temperature with rated temperature conducted in the adjusting unit 37 or the evaluation unit 23 and continued with it in order to convey the ink quantity required for the printed image.<br><br>
18<br>
in a branch parallel the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 the tempcraturc of the jacket surface of the form cylinder 43 is contr ofled or regulated in relationship of the production speed V (sometimes additional!}' dependence on the printing substance and/or the printing ink), whereby regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the form cyllinder 43 under application of a further (not shown) thermo-fceler a similar to that of regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54. this is however not additionally varied through the result of the output unit 23, but it correlates with the production speed V of the printing machine. The contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 takes place independent of the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the form cylinder 43, so that between the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler and the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the form cylinder as a rule there is no fixed compulsory coupling and hence the tempering units 57; 58 can rv individually activated by the adjusting device 37 and hence can be adjusted individually. adjustment of the tempering unit 57: 58 takes place preferably through a remote variation, i.e. through an adjustment carried out from a guide stand. In case there is a coupling between the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 and the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface of the form cylinder 43, it can be altered. T he parallelism of the contr of or regulation of the temperature on the jacket surface  of the screen r ofler 54 and the form cylinder 43 occurs only when the lines carrying the respective tempering agent indicated by circles in fig. 2 in the interior of the screen r ofler 54 or the form cylinder 13 draw the tempering agent from the same tempering agent source (not shown) anchor the lines in the interior of the screen r ofler 54 and the lines of the form cylinder 13 are connected to one another, so that the same tempering agent flows through the lines of the interior of the screen r ofler 54 as well as through the lines of the form cylinder 43. On the other hand, for the screen r ofler 54 and the form cylinder 43 also different tempering agents can be used, furthermore, for the lines carrying the tempering agent for the screen r ofler 54 as well as the lines carr\ ing the tempering agent for the form cylinder 43 the flow of the respective tempering agent flow can be foreseen preferably individually and independent of one another with valves (not shown) that can be adjusted by the adjusting unit 37.<br><br>
19<br>
It is of advantage that a temperature to be adjusted for a value of the production speed V of the printing machine on the jacket surface of the r ofler, especially the screen r ofler 54 and/or<br>
the cylinder. particularly the form cylinder 43. is adjusted or at least adjustment/setting of this required temperature is started before the printing machine sets the new value of the production speed V so that the temperature adjustment with respect to a desired alteration in the production speed \ takes place in an advanced manner. By means of this prc-contr of an otherw ise sy stematicaIly occurring error can be avoided, as due to a time-advanced adaptation of the temperature adjustment the quantity of produced wastage as a result of unsuitable temperature adjustment can be significantly reduced. Because the adaptation of the temperature adjustment reacts at least more slowly, i.e. with a longer reaction time till reaching a stable operating condition, than the alteration in production speed V that is carried out with the help of electronical!} contr ofled or regulated drives. In this way a desired is production speed V that is for example displayed through a corresponding manual on the input and output unit 33 belonging to the evaluation unit 23, e.g. can be programme-technically delayed by the evaluation unit 23 in its execution till the tempering 57, 58 has reached the temperature required for the new production speed V and to be set<br>
the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 and/or the form cylinder 43 completely or at least significant extent of clearly about 50%. preferably above 80%. ideally above 90%.<br>
T he above described measures arc suitable with respect to the screen r ofler 54 alone or for the printing machine as a wh ofe and also foreseen for the reason that the temperature to be set on the jacket r ofler of the screen r ofler 54 can be adjusted in relation to the production speed V of the printing machine 1:1 such a way. that with increasing production speed V of the printing machine areducing capacity of the recesses designed on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler for transmission of ink on to the rotation body 53 adjacent to the screen r ofler 54 is compensated by a reduction in viscosity of the ink caused by the set temperature. Because, w ith increasing production speed V of the printing machine the recesses or cups on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54 filled with printing ink get increasingly incompletely emptied. so that the worsening transmission behaviour of the screen r ofler 54 can be compensated by an adapted thinning of the printing ink to be transmitted, whereby the reduction in viscosity of the printing ink takes place with the help of the temperature to be set on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 5 1.<br><br>
20<br>
in another advantageous design the tempering unit 57; 58 is designed in such a way that the temperature set w ith the adjusting device 37 allocated to this tempering unit 57; 58. on account of a pre-given functional allocation for a value of the production speed V of the printing machine on the jacket surface of the r ofler 54, and/or the cylinder 43, particularly the form cyllinder 43 can be altered within fixed limits by manual adjustment. In this way on has an intervention possibility into pre-machine-given settings, whereby within a maximum permissible t oferance range defined by bound values of e.g. t-/- 5% or 10% with respect to the default value can be manually fine-tuned as required. The bound values can be symmetrically or unsymmetrical distanced from the default value and for example define even a t oferance range between -5% and 10%.<br>
Fig 3 shows an example of a functional relation, as to how the temperature T on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 inv ofved in the printing process can be dependent on the production speed V of the printing machine. The functional relation can be linear or nonlinear. In any case, on the basis of the functional relation for a printing process fixed on account of the used printing ink and the used print substance 49 in relation to production speed V of the printing machine, a suitable value for the temperature T to be set on the jacket surlace oi at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 inv ofved in the printing process can be determined. The mechanically determined value for the temperature T to be set on the jacket surface of at least one of the rotation bodies 43; 47; 53; 54 inv ofved in the printing process can be manually altered within pre-given limits in the sense of a fine tuning. which is indicated in Fig. 3 by a vertical double arrow enclosed by boundary lines.<br>
F ig. 4 similarly shows as an example a functional relation of an ink quantity conveyed by the screen r ofler 54 in relationship to the production speed V of the printing machine. By adapting the temperature 1 on the jacket surface of the screen r ofler 54, especially the viscosity of the printing ink to be conveyed can be altered in such a way that the conveying rate on altering the production speed V of the printing machine remains at least almost constant. Especially the convey ing rate of the screen r ofler 54 can however be made alternatively or in addition to its dependence on the production speed V of the printing machine be made dependent on a determined variation in the actually determined ink density Dl and on the ink density D2 pre-given as rated value.<br><br>
21<br>
 If in the printing machine, in transportation direction of the print substance 49, several printing mechanisms 0 1: 02; 03: 04 (Fig. 1) respectively use the above described device<br>
(F ig.2) according to the invention, then it is advantageous that devices arranged in at least two different printing mechanisms 01: 02; 03: 04 differently set the respective first and/or second parameter of the printed ink in the respective printing mechanism 01; 02; 03; 04. i.e. its costly and easy flow Especially in printing mechanisms 01; 02; 03; 04 arranged successively in transportation direction of the print substance 49, the second parameter of the printing ink, i.e. its easy flow is adjusted with reducing values, so that the easy flow of the printing inks printed successively on the same print substance 49 reduces value-wise. This reduction in value of easy flow, i.e. the reduction in corresponding tack values of the respective printing inks, can be continuous from the first to the last printing ink impressed in the printing machine<br>
