				<td>A PERINEUM MUSCULAR POWER INCREASE DEVICE AND A METHOD<br>
THEREOF<br>
	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The invention relates to a perineum' muscular power<br>
increase device and a method thereof, more particularly ,<br>
relates to a perineum muscular power increase device and a<br>
method thereof wherein a user can do perineum shrink training<br>
continuously with interest and goal because the shrink and<br>
the relation degree of the perineum muscles may be<br>
displayed visually, and wherein the user may do the shrink<br>
training for perineum muscle sanitarily and conveniently<br>
because there is no need to insert a special implement into<br>
the anus or the vagina.<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	In general, the muscle of a body is developed through<br>
shrink training. On the other hand, the muscle is loosened<br>
end degenerates if it is not shrunk and remains at the state<br>
of relaxation. Similarly, the muscles of a perineum may be<br>
developed through shrink training. However, the perineum<br>
muscle is loosened and degenerates in the end if it continues<br>
to be at the state of relaxation. As for the shrink training<br>
of the perineum muscle, many experts like Dr. Keyel of<br>
America and so on have argued that, if the muscles around the<br>
perineum is shrunk- and relaxed repeatedly, many diseases, fox<br>
example, erection deficiency, urinary incontinence,<br>
melancholia, impatience, climacteric symptom, migraine, and<br>
chronic constipation may be cured as well as sexual ability<br>
may be enhanced. And, they have introduced the shrink<br>
training of the perineum muscles as excellent: way to overcome<br>
many diseases like the above. Further, recently, even<br>
ordinary persons who are not proficient in the medical field<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
have appreciated the effect of the shrink training of the<br>
perineum muscle.<br>
	However, there is a problem that, when a person does<br>
the shrink training of the perineum muscle, the other muscles<br>
like the femur muscle and so on may be shrunk together 50<br>
that the perineum muscle cannot be shrunk as mush as he/she<br>
wants. Accordingly, recently, in order to overcome the<br>
problem like the above, many devices for helping the shrink<br>
training of the perineum muscle have been introduced and used,<br>
According to these devices the user may do shrink training<br>
for the perineum muscle by inserting a cone into the anus or<br>
the vagina and by shrinking the muscle of the portion pressed<br>
by the cone. However, these insertion type devices have the<br>
weak points that the user may feel uncomfortable in training<br>
as well as humiliated .or filthy so that he/she does, not like<br>
to use them. And, despite the above weak pointed because the<br>
goods to replace the devices like the above have not been<br>
introduced until now, these insertion type implements have<br>
been utilized only for curing the urinary incontinence.<br>
	And, not only the perineum shrink training is too<br>
monotonous but also the user may not visually watch the<br>
shrink or the relaxation degree of the perineum muscle.<br>
Accordingly, because there is no choice but to do a<br>
monotonous training repeatedly only with his/her will, the<br>
user may not keep doing the training even if he/she knows<br>
that the shrink training is very helpful for health,<br>

	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
	A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described<br>
in detail below by referring to the accompanying drawings.<br>
	Figure 1 and Figure 2 are respectively the dissembled<br>
perspective view and the sectional view of a first embodiment<br>
of the invention. Referring to the drawings, the first<br>
embodiment of the invention includes a pressure assembly 2<br>
which, is provided in the seat part 10 of a chair and presses<br>
the perineum region of the sitter upwardly,, a first detection<br>
means 53 which is provided at the pressure assembly 2 and<br>
detects the force or the pressure applied to the pressure<br>
assembly 2 as the sitter shrinks the perineum muscle P of<br>
Figure 10, and a first display means 57 which is connected to<br>
the first detection means 57 and displays the force or the<br>
pressure detected by the detection means 57. Here, The<br>
pressure assembly 2 includes a pressure head 20 which presses<br>
the perineum region of the sitter upwardly, and a lifting<br>
means 30 which moves the pressure head 20 upwardly and<br>
downwardly.<br>
	The seat part 10, as shown in Figure 2, includes a<br>
cushion member 18 mounted on a seat frame 17, and a main<br>
cover 45 which covers the cushion member 18. Here, an. opening<br>
11 perforated from the upper surface to the lower surface is<br>
provided at the center of the seat part 10, and the centers<br>
of the cushion member IS and the main cover 4 5 are cut to be<br>
opened in the same shape as that of the opening 11 so that<br>
the pressure head 20 may be ascended and descended through<br>
the opening 11. And, a subsidiary cover 40 is provided on the<br>
upper side of the opening 11 and the pressure head 20 is<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
covered with the subsidiary cover 40. Here, the subsidiary<br>
cover 40 is preferably provided on the opening 11 as loose<br>
sheet cover 45 or the subsidiary cover 40 is made of more<br>
elastic mat ferial than that of the main cover 45 in order that<br>
the pressure head 20 may be readily ascended when it ascends<br>
toward the upper side of the seat part 10.<br>
	The pressure assembly 2 may be composed of only a<br>
pressure bead 20 which presses the perineum region of the<br>
sitter upwardly. And, as shown in the drawings, the pressure<br>
assembly 2 may be mounted on the upper part of the lifting<br>
means 3D and may be moved upwardly and downwardly by the<br>
lifting means 30. Here, a vibration motor 29 is provided in<br>
the pressure head 20 so that the perineum muscle of the<br>
sitter may be massaged vibratingly by the vibration motor 29.<br>
And, a plurality of pressure projections 21 are provided on<br>
the upper surface of the pressure head 20 so that the<br>
perineum region of the sitter may be massaged more<br>
effectively by the projections 31. further, a magnet (not<br>
shown in the drawings) is provided in the pressure head 20 so<br>
that the blood of the perineum region may be circulated more<br>
readily.<br>
	Here, the pressure head 20 may be fixed on the upper end<br>
of the lifting means 30, however, as shown in Figure 3, it<br>
may be connected to the upper end of the lifting means 30<br>
through a hinge and an angle adjustment means 20a may be<br>
provided between the pressure head 20 and the lifting means<br>
30 so that the sitter may adjust the angle of the pressure<br>
head 20 corresponding to the lifting means 30 and use the<br>
device of the invention conveniently. The angle adjustment<br>
means 20a may be composed of a jack nut 20b connected to the<br>
pressure head 20, a subsidiary motor 20d provided at the<br>
lifting means 30 vertically, and a jack screw 20c which is<br>
provided at the shaft of the subsidiary motor 20d and is<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
connected to the jack nut 20b. Further, although not shown in<br>
the drawings, like as an embodiment that a wedge block is<br>
pushed to be inserted between the pressure head 20 and the<br>
lifting means 30, an embodiment that the front end or the<br>
base end of the pressure head 20 is. lifted by a cam or an<br>
embodiment that the hinge combination part of the pressure<br>
head 20 is rotated by a worm, various kinds of the<br>
embodiments may be adopted to the invention if they are<br>
provided between the pressure head 20 and the lifting means<br>
30 and may make the angle of the pressure head 20 adjusted<br>
conveniently.<br>
	Preferably, the angle adjustment means 20a is provided<br>
in the pressure assembly 2 and the sitter can adjust the<br>
angle of the pressure head 20. conveniently through the angle<br>
adjustment means 20a according to the sitting pose. In this<br>
case, if the sitter lays his/her upper body toward the<br>
backward side and the perineum region becomes relatively<br>
lower than the front side of the perineum region, he/she may<br>
accord the angle of the pressure head 20 to that of the<br>
perineum region by lowering the backward side of the pressure<br>
head 20 and may use the device of the invention conveniently.<br>
Further, if the angle adjustment means 20a is provided in the<br>
pressure assembly 2 like the above, the training effect for<br>
the specific position of the perineum region may be increased<br>
because the sitter may do the shrink train for the perineum<br>
region at the state that the front position or the back<br>
position of the perineum region is pressed by the pressure<br>
head 20 relatively more.<br>
	The lifting means 30, as shown in Figure 2, makes the<br>
perineum region of the sitter pressed or massaged by moving<br>
the pressure head 20 upwardly. And, the lifting means 30<br>
moves the pressure head 20 downwardly so that the perineum<br>
region of the sitter is not pressed although the user takes a<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
seat for a long time. The lifting means 30 may adopt all the<br>
embodiments that the pressure head 20 may be moved upwardly<br>
and downwardly like as the embodiment that it is ascended, and<br>
descended by a motor and a screw shaft or by a solenoid, a<br>
cylinder or a link. <br>
	The typical lifting means is to utilize a motor and a<br>
screw shaft. According to this means, the lifting means 30<br>
includes a bracket 32 fixed at the lower surface of the seat<br>
part 10, a screw shaft 31 which is fixed at the lower surface<br>
of the pressure head 20 and is provided at the bracket 32<br>
vertically, and a motor 33 which is connected to the screw<br>
shaft 31 and moves the pressure head 20 upwardly and<br>
downwardly.<br>
	And, a worm 34 is mounted at the shaft of the motor 33<br>
and a worm gear 35 is mounted at the screw shaft 31 so that<br>
the worm 34 and the worm gear 35 are engaged each other. The<br>
worm gear 35 is supported upwardly by the bracket 32.<br>
Accordingly, if the worm gear 35 is rotated, the screw shaft<br>
31 is moved upwardly and downwardly. And, a bearing 36 and a<br>
first detection means 53 (described below) are provided<br>
between the worm gear 35 and the bracket 32 in order to<br>
decrease friction.<br>
	And, it is possible that the screw shaft 31 is rotated<br>
by the motor at the state of being supported by the bracket<br>
32 and the pressure head 20 is rotatably combined at the<br>
periphery of the screw shaft 31. In this case, the pressure<br>
head 20 is moved upwardly and downwardly when the screw shaft<br>
31 is rotated by the motor 33.<br>
	Further, preferably, the motor 33 is connected to a<br>
controller 50 (described below) in order that the rotation<br>
angle of it may be controlled, and the controller 50 is<br>
connected to the input means 55 in order that a signal may be<br>
inputted to it and operation program for each mode is<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
previously stored to the controller 50 In this case, the<br>
motor 33, the vibration motor 29, and a first display part 57<br>
and so on may be operated according to the program when a<br>
certain operation mode is chosen through the input part 55.<br>
	Accordingly, if the pressure head 20 is ascended by the<br>
lifting means 30, as shown in Figure 10, the center of the<br>
perineum muscle p is pushed to be ascended upwardly, and if<br>
the sitter shrinks the perineum muscle P at such a state, the<br>
perineum muscle p pushed to be ascended upwardly is stretched<br>
downwardly so that the pressure head 20 is moved downwardly.<br>
Here, a first detection means 53 is provided in the lifting<br>
means 30 of Figure 2 and may be shrunk vertically so that the<br>
shrink force which moves the pressure head 20 downwardly is<br>
detected by the first detection means 53 and the shrink force<br>
may be displayed visually.<br>
	For example, the first detection means 53 is provided<br>
between the bracket 32 and the worm gear 35 so that it<br>
detects the shrink pressure or the shrink force of the<br>
perineum muscle P, and the detected data is transmitted to a<br>
first display means 57 so that it is visually displayed by a<br>
LED or a digital display means. Here, the first detection<br>
means 53 may be provided between an upper pressure head and<br>
a lower pressure head which have been divided into a pair, or<br>
it may be provided between the pressure head 20 and the<br>
lifting means 30. Like this, the first detection means 53 may<br>
be provided wherever the force or the pressure applied to the<br>
pressure head 20 is transmitted while the sitter is shrinking<br>
the perineum region.<br>
	Further, when the perineum region is shrunk, the first<br>
detection means 53 detects the pressure or the force applied<br>
to the perineum region and makes the force or the pressure<br>
displayed visually through the first display part 57.<br>
Accordingly, the sitter may adjust the pressure or the force<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
of the pressure assembly 2 to the degree suitable for him/her<br>
	The first display means 57 displays the force data or<br>
the pressure data transmitted from the first detection means<br>
53 visually. Preferably, the controller 50 of Figure 2 is<br>
connected between the first detection means 53 and the first<br>
display means 57. in this case, the force data or the<br>
pressure data transmitted from the first detection means 53<br>
may be displayed in a variety of types like as in a<br>
digitalized type. Of course, without the controller 50 at the<br>
display means 57, it is possible that the data from the first<br>
detection means 53 may be transmitted to the first displayer<br>
57a through an amplifier and etc that the data may be<br>
displayed as analogue signal.<br>
	Preferably, a reset button 56 is connected to the<br>
controller 50 so that the force or the pressure data<br>
transmitted from the first detection means 53 may be<br>
initialized as aero if the sitter pushes the reset button 56.<br>
Accordingly, if the sitter pushes the reset button 56 and<br>
shrinks his/her perineum region, the weight of the sitter<br>
applied to the pressure assembly 2 is excluded and only the<br>
force or the pressure during the shrink of the perineum<br>
region is displayed visually.<br>
	And, according to the embodiment, the pressure assembly 2<br>
is mounted at the seat part 10 of a chair. However, it is<br>
also possible that the pressure assembly 2 is not mounted at<br>
the seat part 10 but is manufactured in an independent unit.<br>
In this case, after taking down the pressure assembly 2 on<br>
the floor of a room and sitting on it, the user may do the<br>
shrink train for the perineum muscle P, watching the degree<br>
of the shrink or the relaxation of the perineum muscle P<br>
through the first display means 57.<br>
	According to the first embodiment of the invention as<br>
described above, when the pressure head 20 has been moved<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
upwardly and the perineum muscle P of Figure 10 has been<br>
pushed to be moved upwardly, if the sitter shrinks the<br>
perineum muscle p, the pressure head 20 is moved downwardly<br>
by the shrink force of the perineum muscle B so that the<br>
force or the pressure is detected by the first detection<br>
means 57 of Figure 2 while the sitter is shrinking the<br>
perineum muscle P and it is displayed visually by the first<br>
display part 57,<br>
	Further, the pressure head 20 is moved upwardly by the<br>
lifting means and the perineum region of the sitter is<br>
pressed by it so that the pressure or the massage may be.<br>
applied at the same time. Here, the first detection means 57<br>
is provided at the pressure assembly 2 and makes the force or<br>
the pressure displayed visually while the perineum region is<br>
being pressed or massaged by the sitter's shrink training.<br>
Accordingly, the sitter, may adjust the force or the pressure<br>
to the degree most suitable for him/her.<br>
	The operation of the first embodiment will be described<br>
below in each mode by referring to Figure 2 and Figure 10.<br>
Firstly, if the sitter inputs the massage mode through the<br>
input part 55, the pressure head 20 is ascended by the<br>
lifting means 30 and makes the perineum region of the sitter<br>
pressed upwardly as well as the vibration motor 29 is driven<br>
to massage the perineum region by vibration so that the<br>
fatigue accumulated to the perineum region may be dissolved.<br>
	And, the sitter inputs the pressure mode, the pressure<br>
head 20 is moved upwardly by the lifting means 30 and the<br>
perineum region is pressed toward the upper direction<br>
upwardly for a predetermined time. And, the pressure head is<br>
again moved downwardly and release the pressure. As a result,<br>
because the pressure head 20 repeats ascending and descending<br>
movement continuously so that, the perineum region may be<br>
pressed and relaxed repeatedly for a predetermined time, the<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/045421 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
acupuncture point around the perineum region may be pressed<br>
as if the acupuncture point is pressed by a finger pressure<br>
professional. Accordingly the pressure effect may be acquired<br>
that the circulation organism is normally recovered or the<br>
circulation function may be enhanced.<br>
	Next, if the sitter inputs the training mode, the<br>
pressure head 20 is moved upwardly by the lifting means 30,<br>
as shown in figure 10, the central part of the sitter's<br>
perineum region is pushed upwardly to be maintained at the<br>
state. And, if the sitter shrinks the perineum muscles P at<br>
this stats, the perineum muscles p pushed upwardly is pulled<br>
downwardly again. Here, a first detection means 53 is<br>
provided in the lifting means 30 vertically, and the<br>
descending pressure or force of the pressure head 20 may be<br>
detected by the first detection means 30 to be transmitted to<br>
a controller 50 so that the controller 50 displays the data<br>
inputted from the first detection means 30 visually.<br>
Accordingly, the sitter may continue the shrink training with<br>
interest, watching the shrink and the relaxation degree of<br>
the perineum region. And, a timer (not shown) is preferably<br>
provided in the controller 50. Accordingly, the first display<br>
means 57 displays the time fox which the perineum muscles p<br>
is shrunk, the sitter may do the shrink training after<br>
exactly adjusting the time of the shrink and the relaxation.<br>
	And, a second embodiment of the invention, as shown in<br>
Figure 4, includes a pressure assembly 2 which is provided at<br>
the center of the seat part 10 and is projected upwardly, a<br>
fluid chamber 60 provided in the pressure assembly 2, and a<br>
second display part 71 which is connected to the fluid<br>
chamber 60 and displays the pressure of the fluid transmitted<br>
from the fluid chamber 60.<br>
	Here, the pressure assembly 2 includes a pressure head 20<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
and a lifting means. 30 which moves the pressure head 20<br>
upwardly and downwardly. And, the seat part 10, the pressure<br>
head 20, and the lifting means 30 are as same as those of the<br>
first embodiment, and the detailed description for these will<br>
not be explained below.<br>
	The fluid chamber 60 is provided in the pressure assembly<br>
2 and it is composed of a fluid chamber and so on. And, the<br>
inner space of the fluid chamber 60 is filled with fluid.<br>
Accordingly, when the sitter shrinks the perineum muscles P,<br>
the fluid chamber 60 is pressed downwardly so that the fluid<br>
in the chamber 60 is transmitted to the second display means<br>
71. The fluid chamber 60 may be provided wherever the shrink<br>
force of the perineum muscle P may be transmitted. Preferably,<br>
a groove 25 is provided on the upper surface of the pressure<br>
head 20, and the fluid chamber 60 is provided in the groove<br>
25. In this case, the fluid chamber 60 may be also functioned<br>
as a cushion member.<br>
	The second display means 71 adopts the conventional fluid<br>
pressure gauge 72 which displays the pressure of the fluid<br>
transmitted from the fluid chamber 60 by an indication needle<br>
72a visually.<br>
	The seat part 10 described above may be adopted not only<br>
to the seat panel of a chair but also a cushion or a variety<br>
of seat panels to sit on. And, the pressure assembly 2<br>
includes not only the case that the pressure head 20 is moved<br>
up and down by the lifting means but also the case that the<br>
pressure head 20 is always projected from the upper surface<br>
of the seat panel without a specific lifting means. Further,<br>
not only the pressure assembly 2 is provided in the seat part<br>
10 but also it may be manufactured in an independent unit. In<br>
this case, after he/she takes down the pressure assembly 2 on<br>
the floor of a room and sits on it, the sitter may do the<br>
shrink train for the perineum P, watching the degree of the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
shrink or the relaxation degree of the perineum muscle P<br>
through the first display means 71.<br>
	And, Figure 5 shows a first application example of the<br>
second embodiment. The seat part 10, the pressure assembly 2,<br>
and the fluid chamber 60 and so on of the first application<br>
example are as same as those of the above described second<br>
embodiment. However a pressure sensor 7la and a controller<br>
50 are further connected between the fluid chamber 60 and the<br>
second display means 71. The controller 50 converts a signal<br>
transmitted from the pressure sensor 71a into data (for<br>
example, figure data) and transmits the data to the second<br>
display means 71.<br>
	Here, as described in the first embodiment, a reset<br>
button 56 is connected to the controller 50. The reset button<br>
56 initializes the pressure data transmitted from the<br>
pressure Sensor 71a as zero value. Further, as described in<br>
the first embodiment, the program for pressure, massage and<br>
training is previously stored in the controller 50 so that<br>
the sitter may select the desired mode and use the device of<br>
the invention.<br>
	The training mode of the first application example of the<br>
second embodiment is as follows. If the sitter shrinks the<br>
perineum muscles P of Figure 10 at the state that the<br>
perineum region has been, pushed upwardly and is ascended by<br>
the pressure head 20, the fluid chamber 60 is pressed<br>
downwardly by the shrink force of the perineum P so that the<br>
fluid in the fluid chamber 60 (for, a fluid chamber) is<br>
transmitted to the second display means 71 and this second<br>
display means 71 displays the pressure applied to the fluid<br>
chamber 60 visually. Accordingly, the sitter may continue the<br>
shrink for the perineum muscle P interestingly, watching the<br>
shrink or the relaxation degree of the perineum muscle a<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
	And, Figure 6 shows a second application example of the<br>
second embodiment, which includes a pressure assembly 2 which<br>
is projected upwardly at the center of the seat part 10, a<br>
fluid chamber 60 provided in the pressure assembly 2, and a<br>
second display means 71 which is connected to the fluid<br>
chamber 60 and displays the pressure of the fluid transmitted<br>
from the fluid chamber 60, Here, the second display means 71<br>
is composed of a cylinder 70 which is expanded or contracted<br>
by the pressure of the fluid transmitted from the fluid<br>
chamber 60, an elasticity means 75 which pushes the piston 73<br>
in the cylinder 70 against the inflow direction of the fluid,<br>
and a display means 78 having an indication needle 77. The<br>
indication needle 77 is moved forwardly or backwardly by the<br>
piston 12, and displays the pressure applied to the pressure<br>
assembly 2 while the sitter is shrinking the perineum muscle<br>
P.<br>
	And, the pressure assembly 2 includes a pressure head 20<br>
which is projected upwardly at the center of the seat part 10<br>
and presses the perineum region of the sitter upwardly. The<br>
pressure head 20 is composed of elastic material, and a fluid<br>
chamber 60 is provided in the pressure head 20, And, a<br>
vibration motor 29 is mounted in the pressure head 20 and the<br>
perineum region of the sitter may be vibrated and massaged by<br>
the vibration motor 29. Accordingly, the fluid chamber 60<br>
Like as a fluid pack is pressed downwardly by the shrink<br>
force of the perineum muscle P when the sitter shrinks the<br>
perineum region so that the fluid in the fluid chamber 60 is<br>
transmitted to the cylinder 70.<br>
	The cylinder 70 is to be extended when its piston 73 is<br>
pushed backwardly by the pressure of the fluid transmitted<br>
from the fluid chamber 60. And, an elasticity means 75 is<br>
provided in the cylinder 70 and the piston 73 is pushed<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
toward the shrink direction of the cylinder 70.<br>
	The display means 78 has an indication needle 77 which is<br>
connected to the piston 73. Hare, the forward end of the<br>
piston 73 may be utilized as the indication needle 77, or a<br>
needle may be provided at the forward end of the piston 73.<br>
And, a transparent gaze panel 76 is provided at the display<br>
means 78 in order chat the sitter may see through the<br>
indication needle 77, and a scale 79 is marked at the outer<br>
surface of the gaze panel 76 or the indication implement 76.<br>
	The training mode of the second application example of<br>
the second embodiment is as follows. If the sitter shrinks<br>
the perineum muscles P of Figure 10 at the state that the<br>
perineum region has been pushed upwardly and ascended by the<br>
pressure head 20, the fluid chamber 60 is pressed downwardly<br>
by the shrink force of the perineum muscle p so that the<br>
fluid filled in the pack 60 is forcibly transmitted to the<br>
cylinder 70. accordingly, the piston 13 of the cylinder 70 is<br>
pushed backwardly by the pressure of the fluid which flows in<br>
the cylinder 70 so that the pressure applied to the fluid<br>
chamber 60 may be displayed by the indication needle 77<br>
connected to the piston 73.<br>
	And, if the perineum muscle P is relaxed again, the<br>
pressure applied to the fluid chamber 60 is released and the<br>
piston 73 in the cylinder 70 is pushed, backwardly by the<br>
repelling force of the elasticity means 75 so that the fluid<br>
flown in the cylinder 70 is transmitted into the fluid<br>
chamber 60 again and the indication needle 77 connected to<br>
the piston 73 is restored to the original state.<br>
	Further, a third embodiment of the invention, as shown in<br>
Figure 7, includes a pressure head 20 which is provided in<br>
the center of the seat part 10 and presses the perineum<br>
region of the sitter upwardly, an elasticity means 28 which<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
pushes the pressure head 20 upwardly, a second detection<br>
means 53a which is provided, under the pressure head 20 and<br>
detects the descending distance of the pressure head 20 or<br>
whether the pressure head 20 is contacted thereto when the<br>
sitter shrinks the perineum regions and a third display means<br>
80 which is connected to the second detection means 53a acid<br>
displays the detected data visually.<br>
	The pressure head 20 is provided over the same lifting<br>
means 30 to that described in the above described first<br>
embodiment in order to be elastically pushed upwardly, or<br>
although not shown, it is provided in the seat part 10 in<br>
order to be elastically pushed toward the upper direction by<br>
the elasticity means 28. And, a vibration motor 29 is<br>
provided in the pressure head 20,<br>
	The elasticity means 28 is vertically provided on the<br>
washer 21 which is moved upwardly or downwardly by a<br>
adjustment screw 26, and pushes the adjustment screw 26<br>
elastically toward the upper direction. And, as needed, the<br>
sitter may adjust the elastic force of the elasticity means<br>
26 by tightening or by loosening the adjustment screw 26,<br>
	The second detection means 53a is provided under the<br>
pressure head 20. If the sitter shrinks the perineum muscles<br>
P, the second detection means 53a detects the distance that<br>
the pressure head is moved up and down by the shrink force of<br>
the perineum muscles P or whether the pressure head 20 is<br>
contacted thereto. The second detection means 53 may adopt a<br>
proximity sensor, a touch sensor, or many kinds of sensors<br>
including a switch which may detect the moving distance of<br>
the pressure head 20 or whether the pressure head 20 is<br>
contacted thereto.<br>
	The third display means 90 displays the data detected by<br>
the second detection means 53a visually. Preferably, 3<br>
controller 50 is connected between the second detection means<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
53a and the third display means 80. Here, the controller 50<br>
may have pressure mode, massage mode and training mode so<br>
that the sitter may select the respective modes that he/she<br>
wants .<br>
	Further, it is also possible that a timer (not shown) is<br>
provided in the controller SO. In this case, if a signal from<br>
the second detection means 53a is inputted into the<br>
controller, the third display means displays the time that<br>
the perineum muscle P is shrunk so that the user may know<br>
whether the perineum muscle P is shrunk or not. Further, a<br>
specific controller is not provided between the second<br>
detection means 53a and the third display means 30 but a lamp<br>
is provided at the third display means 80 and the lamp may be<br>
lighted by the signal 'ON' of the second detection means 53a,<br>
	The training mode of the third embodiment is as follows.<br>
If the sitter shrinks the perineum muscles P of Figure 10 at<br>
the state that the perineum region has been pushed upwardly<br>
and is ascended by the pressure head 20, the shrink force of<br>
the perineum muscles P is applied to the pressure head 20 and<br>
the pressure head is descended downwardly against the elastic<br>
force of the elasticity means 26, Here, the second detection<br>
means 53a is provided under the pressure head 20 and the<br>
second detection means 53a detects the distance that the<br>
pressure head 20 is moved up and down or whether the pressure<br>
head 20 is contacted thereto so that the distance data or the<br>
shrink signal may be displayed visually by the third display<br>
means 80. Accordingly, the sitter may do continuously the<br>
shrink training with interest, watching the shrink degree of<br>
the perineum muscles P through the third display means 80<br>
	Further, Figure 8 shows the application example of the<br>
third embodiment. And, as the pressure head 20, the lifting<br>
means 30, the second detection means 53a, the third display<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
means 80 and so on are as similar as those of the above<br>
described third embodiment, the detailed for these will not<br>
be described below. However, according to this application<br>
example, a channel type support bracket 36 is provided at the<br>
lower surface of the seat part 10, a pressure assembly 2<br>
having a pressure head 20 and an lifting means 30 is provided<br>
on the upper surface of the support bracket 38, and a second<br>
detection means 53a is provided at the lower side, that is,<br>
on the upper surface of the support bracket 38. And, the<br>
second detection means 53a detects the descending distance of<br>
the pressure assembly 2 or whether the pressure assembly 2 is<br>
contacted thereto.<br>
	Further, a forth embodiment of the invention, as shown in<br>
Figure 9, comprises a pressure assembly 2 which is provided<br>
in a housing 90, an elasticity means 23 which elastically<br>
pushes the pressure assembly 2, and a forth display means 38<br>
having an indicator 35 which is connected to the pressure<br>
assembly 2 and displays the descending distance of the<br>
pressure assembly 2 while the perineum muscle P is shrunk.<br>
Here, the pressure assembly 2 may be composed of only a<br>
pressure head 20, or may be composed of both the pressure<br>
head 20 and the lifting means 30 as shown in Figure B. And<br>
the pressure assembly or the elasticity means and so on is<br>
similar to those of the above described first embodiment, the<br>
detailed description for these will not be explained below.<br>
	The indication gauge. 85 is a lever whose central part is<br>
combined to the bracket 93 in the housing 90 by a, hinge in<br>
order to be rotated upwardly and downwardly as axis at the<br>
hinge, and one end of it is connected to the pressure head 20<br>
rotatably and the visually exposed indication means 86 is<br>
provided at another end of it. Here, the indication means 86<br>
is covered with a transparent gaze window(or, panel) 87 and a<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
scale is marked on the transparent window 87 50 that the<br>
sitter may watch the descending degree of the pressure head<br>
20 Further, the indicator 35 may adopt whatever may be moved<br>
together with the pressure head 20 when the pressure head 20<br>
is descended and operate the visually exposed indicator 85.<br>
	The training mode of the forth embodiment will be<br>
explained below, if the sitter shrinks the perineum muscles p<br>
at the state that the perineum region has been pushed<br>
upwardly and is ascended by the pressure head 20, the<br>
pressure head 20 is descended against the elastic force of<br>
the elasticity means 28 by the shrink force of the perineum<br>
muscle p. Here, the pressure head 20 is connected to one end<br>
of the indicator 85 by a hinge and one end of the indication<br>
implement 35 is descended together with the pressure head 20<br>
so that the indicator 86 provided at another end of the<br>
indicator 35 is ascended toward the opposite direction and<br>
displays the shrink force of the perineum muscle P.<br>
	In the above embodiments, the components described in the<br>
same terms and the same references have been explained<br>
briefly in order to prevent the redundant explanation,<br>
however, it must be noted that all of these components have<br>
the same structure and the same function to those described<br>
in the above embodiments.<br>
	Further, the method of increasing the shrink force of the<br>
perineum muscle p has been described in respective training<br>
modes of the respective embodiments, but the method will be<br>
briefly described below. Firstly, when the perineum region of<br>
the sitter is pressed upwardly by the pressure assembly 2 of<br>
Figure 10 and the center of the perineum muscle P is pushed<br>
upwardly, if the sitter shrinks the perineum muscle P and<br>
makes the pressure assembly 2 pressed downwardly, the user<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2004/045411 							PCT/KR2003/002336<br>
may do the shrink training for the perineum muscle P<br>
conveniently and effectively without inserting a specific<br>
implement into the anus or the vagina.<br>
	And, the force or the pressure or the descending distance<br>
applied to the pressure assembly 2 is detected through the<br>
respective detection means 53, 53a, the pressure sensor 71a,<br>
the pressure means 72 or the pressing degree of the<br>
elasticity means 28, 75 to be displayed visually.<br>
	And, according as the sitter shrinks the perineum muscle<br>
P, predetermined force or pressure is applied to the pressure<br>
assembly 2 so that the pressure assembly is retreated in a<br>
predetermined distance. And, the force or the pressure<br>
applied to the pressure assembly 2, or the retreat distance<br>
of the pressure assembly 2 and so on is detected by the<br>
respective detection means 53, 53a, the pressure sensor 71a,<br>
the pressure gauge 72 or the contraction degree and so on.<br>
And, the detected force and so on may be displayed by the<br>
respective display means 57, 71, 80, 88 visually. Accordingly,<br>
the sitter may .continue the shrink training of the perineum<br>
muscle P with interest and aim, watching the shrink and the<br>
relaxation degree of the perineum muscle p.<br>
	According to the invention, if the sitter shrinks the<br>
place which is pressed upwardly to be stimulated by the<br>
pressure head 20, the shrink training of the perineum muscle<br>
P is performed automatically so that he/she may easily do the<br>
shrink training for even the perineum region which has not<br>
been trained in ordinary times,<br>
	And, as the shrink and the relaxation degree of the<br>
perineum muscle p may be displayed visually, the sitter may<br>
continue the shrink training with goal and interest, watching<br>
the shrink and the relaxation degree of the perineum muscle P.<br>
	Further, the invention has an advantage that the sitter<br>
25<br><br>
