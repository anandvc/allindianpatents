METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS<br>
1.  INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates, first, to methods for the synthesis of peptides, in particular T-20 (also referred to as "DP-17S"; SEQ ID N0:1) and T"20-li}:e peptides.  Such methods utilize solid and liquid phase synthesis procedures to synthesize and combine groups of specific peptide fragments to yield the peptide of interest.  The present invention further relates to individual peptide fragments v;hich act as intermediates in the synthesis of the peptides of interest (e.g., T-20).  The present invention still further relates uO groups of such peptide intermediate fragments which can be utilized together to produce full length T-20 and T-20-ii}:e peptides.  The present invention still further relates to methods for the purification of peptides, in particular T-20 and T-20-lice peptides, and the individual peptide fragments which act as intermediates in the synthesis of the subject peptides.<br>
2. BACKGROUND<br>
Recently, a large number of peprides have been identified which exhibit an ability to inhibit fusion-associated events, and, importantly, also exhibit porent antiviral activity.  See, for example, U.S. Patent Ncs. 5,464,933; 5,656,480 and PCT Publication No. Wo 96/19495T-20. As these peptides to extensively be used, as therapeutics, for example, the need arises for an ability to synthesize in large scale quantities.<br>
While techniques exist for peptide synthesis, (see, e.c., Mergler et al., 1988, Tetrahedron Letters 29:4005-4008; Mergler et al., 1988, Tetrahedron Letters 29:4009-4012; Kamber et al. (eds), "Peptides, Chemistry and Biology, ESCOM, Leiden, 1992, 525-526; and Riniker et al., 1993, Tetrahedron Letters 49:9307-9320) no techniques currently exist which can<br><br>
be utilized for large scale, economical production of easily purified peptides such as T-20 and T-20-like peptides.<br>
3.  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, first, to methods for the synthesis of peptides, in particular T-20 (also referred to as "DP-178"; SEQ ID N0:1) and T-20-like peptides.  Such methods utilize solid and liquid phase synthesis procedures to synthesize and combine groups of specific peptide fragments to yield the peptide of interest.  Generally, the methods of the invention comprise synthesizing specific side-chain protected peptide fragment intermediates of T-20 or a T-20-like peptide on a solid support, coupling the protected fragm.ents in solution to form a protected T-20 or T-20-like peptide, followed by deprotection of the side chains to yield the final T-20 or T-20-like peptide.  A preferred embodiment of the methods of the invention involves the synthesis of a T-2 0 peptide having an amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO:l.<br>
The present invention further relates to individual peptide fragments which act as intermediates in the synthesis of the peptides of interest, (e.g. , T-20) .  The peptide fragments of the invention include, but are not limited to, ' those having amino acid sequences as depicted in Table 1 below:<br><br><br><br>
The present invention still further relates to particular groups of peptide fragments which act as intermediates in the synthesis of the peptide of interestâ€¢ The groups of peptide fragments according to the invention include Groups 1-20, as designated in Table 2 below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This invention is based, in part, on the inventors' unexpected discovery rhat certain combinations of solid phase liquid phase synthetic reactions allow high purity T-20 and T-20-like peptides to be manufactured for the first time on a large scale with high throughput and high yield.  In particular, in accordance with the methods of the invention, T-20 and T-20 peptides may be synthesized on a scale of one or more kilograms.  It has been found that by selecting the specific T-20 peptide fragments of the invention for solid phase synthesis, the highly efficient coupling of solid phase techniques may be exploited without having to use the 3-, 4-or even 5-fold excess of amino acids and reagents that are normally required in solid phase synthesis.  The methods of the invention use only about a 1.5-fold of amino acid in the solid phase synthesis of the peptide fragments of the invention.  This cost-saving reduction in the amount of amino acid and reagents makes the methods of the invention suitable for large scale synthesis of T-20 and T-20-like peptides.<br>
In addition, the invenrors have surprisingly found that certain peptide fragments may be synthesized in the solid phase at a loading of about O.S to 1 mmol per gram of solid phase resin.  This loading is significantly greater than the loading range of 0.25 to 0.4 mmol per'gram of resin typically achieved in solid phase peptide synthesis.  Moreover, the inventors have found that synthesizing selected peptide fragments in the solid phase using super acid sensitive resin produces peptide fragments of unusually high purity. Chromatographic techniques are not necessary to purify the peptide fragments produced according to the invention; the fragments are simply put through precipitation and/or trituration steps before use, or used as obtained directly from the resin.  Use of a super acid sensitive resin allows the synthesized, protected peptides of the invention to be cleaved from the resin without concomitant removal of the side-chain protecting groups.  This reduces impurities, and allows peptides comprising 10 amino acids or greater to be<br><br>
synthesized in high purity.  The impurity profile of T-20 and T-20-like peptides which are synthesized in the solution phase according to the methods of the invention by coupling of the high purity peptide fragments produced according to the invention consists of mainly fragments that did not couple, rather than closely related analogues.  Accordingly, T-20 and T-20-like peptides produced according to the invention are much easier to purify than those produced according to conventional techniques.  The Examples presented in Sections 9 and 11, below, demonstrate such combinatorial syntheses of T-20 full length peptides.  The examples present in Section 11 demonstrates the large scale synthesis and purification of T-20 and T-20 intermediate peptides. Accordingly, the methods of the invention T-20 and T-20 peptide intermediates may be produced on a scale of one or more kilograms.<br>
The present inventors have also unexpectedly found that peptides such as T-20 and other T-20-like peptides, as well as certain peptide fragments described herein may be purified using high capacity materials v;hich can be used at basic pH .ranges.  Thus, the present invention still further relates to methods for the purification of peptides, in particular T-20 and T-20-like peptides, and the individual peptide fragments which act as intermediates in the synthesis of the subject peptides.<br><br><br><br>

5.  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 5.1  FULL LENGTH PEPTIDES The present invention relates to methods, peptide fragments, groups of peptide fragments which can be used to synthesize the peptide known as T-20, or alternatively, DP-173.  T-20 is a peptide which corresponds to amino acid residues 638 to 673 of the transmembrane protein gp41 from KIV-lr_,'x isolate and has the 3 6 amino acid sequence (reading from amino, NH', to carboxy, COOH, terminus):<br>
It will be understood that the methods, fragments and groups of fragments and techniques utilised for choosing the fragm'ents and groups of fragments of the present invention may be used to synthesize T-20-like fragments in addition to T-20.  The term "T-20-like" as used herein means any KIV or non-HIV peptide listed in U.S.   Patent Nos. 5,4 64,93 3; 5,656,480 or PCT Publication No. V70 96/19495, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In addition to T-20 and the T-20-like peptides described above, the methods, fragments and groups of fragments of the present invention may be used to synthesize peptides having modified amino and/or carboxyl terminal ends-  Taking T-20 as an example, such peptides can be of the formula:<br>
wherein X represents an amino group; a hydrophobic group selected from the group consisting of carbobenzoxyl, dansyl, and T-butyloxycarbonyl; an acetyl group; a 9-fluoroenyl-<br><br>
methoxy-carbonyl (FMOC) group; or a macromolecular carrier group selected from the group consisting of lipid-fatty acid conjugates, polyethylene glycol, and carbohydrates; and Z represents a carboxyl group; an amido group; a T-butyloxycarbonyl group; a para-nitrobenzyl ester group; or a macromolecular carrier group selected from the group consisting of lipid-fatty acid conjugates, polyethylene glycol, and carbohydrates.  Techniques for addition of such "X" and "Z" groups are Well knoWn to those of skill in the<br>
art.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention are used to synthesize the peptide having the above formula wherein X is an acetyl group and Z is an amide group.  The Examples presented in Section 9, below, demonstrate the successful synthesis of T-20 peptides via coupling of peptide intermediates described, below, in Section 5.2-  In a preferred method, T-20 and T-20-like peptides and intermediates can be purified using any non-silica based column packing (for maximization of loading capacity) including but not limited to zirconium.-based packings, polystyrene, poly-acrylic or other polymer based packings which are stable at high (greater than seven) pH ranges.  For example, among the non-silica-laded column packing exhibiting a broad pH range that includes pH valves greater than that are sold by Tosohaus (Montgomeryville, PA).  Columns packed with such material can be run in loW medium or high pressure chromatography.  See, for example, the purification method presented in Section 10, below.<br>
5.2  PEPTIDE INTERHEDIATES<br>
The present invention encompasses, but is not limited to, peptide fragment intermediates of T-20 and T-20-like peptides with specific amino acid sequences as listed in . Table 1 above, and the groups of peptide fragment intermediates listed in table 2.  Such peptide interm'ediates.<br><br>
especially in groups as listed in Table 2, beloW can be<br>
utilized to produce T-20 and T-20 like peptides.<br>
Any one or more of the side-chains of the amino acid residues of peptide fragments listed in Table 1 or 2 may be protected With standard protecting groups such as t-butyl (t-Bu), trityl (trt) and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc).     The t-Bu group is the preferred side-chain protecting group for amino acid residues Tyr(Y), Thr(T), Ser(S) and Asp(D); the trt group is the preferred side-chain protecting group for amino acid residues His(H), Gln(Q) and Asn(N); and the Boc group is the preferred side-chain protecting group for amino acid residues Lys(K) and Trp(V7).<br>
During the synthesis of fragments 1, 2, 3 and 4 listed in Table 1, the side-chain of the histidine residue must be protected, preferably With a trityl (trt) protecting group. If it is not projected, the acid used to cleave the peptide fragment from the resin will detrimentally react with the histidine residue, causing degradation of the peptide fragment-<br>
Preferably, the glutamine residues of the peptide fragments of the invention are protected vith trityl (trt) groups.  However, it is preferred not to prorect the glutamine residue at the carboxy-terminal end of fragments 1-16 and 9-16.  It has been found that the absence of a protective group on the glutamine residue at the carboxy-terminal end of the 1-16 fragment facilitates reaction of the 1-16 fragment with the 17-36 fragment, allowing coupling of the fragments with only about 2% racemization.  In addition, if lower solubility of any of the peptide fragments of the invention in organic solvents is desired, the trityl protecting groups may be eliminated from any one or more of the other glutamine residues of the fragments.<br>
Preferably, all the asparagine residues of each peptide fragment of the invention are protected.  In addition, it is<br><br>
preferred that the tryptophan residue is protected with a Boc group.<br>
Protected peptide fragments according to peptide formulas 1-18 listed in Table 1 above include, but are not limited to, the compounds listed in Table 3 below.<br><br><br><br>
Any one or more of the side-chains of the amino acid residues of the peptides listed in Table 3 above may be protected With standard side-chain protecting groups such as tBu, trt and I Boc, as described above.  Representative synthesis of peptides from Table 3 are presented in Sections 7 and 8, beloW, which utilize the general techniques discussed in Section 5.4, below.<br><br>
5,3  PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS As discussed above, some of the individual peptide fragments of the invention are preferably made using solid phase synthesis techniques, while other peptides of the invention are preferably made using a combination of solid phase and solution phase synthesis techniques, said syntheses culminating in the production of T-20 or T-20-like peptides as described herein.  HoWever, it will be understood that the peptide fragments of the invention may be synthesized or prepared by techniques Well known in the art.  See, for example, Creighton, 1983, Proteins:  Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman and Co., NY, Which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The peptides of the invention may alternatively be synthesized such that one cr more of the bonds Which link the amino acid residues of the peptides are non-peptide bonds. These alternative non-peptide bonds may be formed by utilizing reactions well known to those in the art, and may include, but are not limited to imino, ester, hydrazide, semicarbazide, and azo bonds, to name but a few.<br>
In yer another embodiment of the invention, T-20 and T-20 like peptides comprising the sequences described above may be synthesized with additional chemical groups present at their amino and/or carboxy termini, such that, for example, the stability, reactivity and/or solubility of the peptides is enhanced.  For example, hydrophobic groups such as carbobenzoxyl, dansyl, acetyl or t-butyloxycarbonyl groups, may be added to the peptides' amino termini.  Likewise, an acetyl group or a 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl group may be placed at the peptides' amino termini.  (See "X" modification of T-20, described above.)  Additionally, the hydrophobic group, t-butyloxycarbonyl, or an amido group may be added to the peptides' carboxy termini.  Similarly, a para-nitrobenzyl ester group may be placed at the peptides' carboxy termini. (See "Z" modification of T-20, described above.)  Techniques<br><br>
for introducing such modifications are well known to those of<br>
skill in the art.<br>
Further, T-20 and T-20-like peptides may be synthesized such that their steric configuration is altered.  For example, the D-isomer of one or more of the amino acid residues of the peptide may be used, rather than the usual L-<br>
isomer.<br>
Still further, at least one of the amino acid residues of the peptides of the invention may be substituted by one of the well known non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. Alterations such as these may serve to increase the stability, reactivity and/or solubility of the peptides of<br>
the invention.<br>
Any of the T-20 or T-20-like peptides may be synthesized to additionally have a macromolecular carrier group covalently attached to their amino and/or carboxy termini. Such macromolecular carrier groups may include, for example, lipid-fatty acid conjugates, polyethylene glycol, carbohydrates or additional peptides.  The "X" modification of T-20 described above may therefore additionally represent any of the above macromolecular carrier groups covalently attached to the amino terminus of a peptide, with an additional peptide group being preferred.  Likewise, rhe "Z" modification of T-20 described above may additionally represent any of the macromolecular carrier groups described above.<br>
Preferably, the peptide fragments of the present invention are synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) techniques using standard FMOC protocols.  See, e.g.. Carpino et al., 1970, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 92(19):5748-5749; Carpino et al., 1972, J. Org. Chem. 37(22):3404-3409.  In a preferred embodiment, the solid phase synthesis of the peptide fragments of the present invention is carried out on super acid sensitive solid supports which include, but are not limited to, 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (see, e.g., Barlos et al.. 1989, Tetrahedron Letters 30(30):3943-3946)<br><br>
and 4-hydroxyinethyl-3-methoxyphenoxybutyric acid resin (see, e-c. , Seiber, 1987, Tetrahedron Letters 23 (49) : 6147-6150, and Richter et al., 1994, Tetrahedron Letters 35 (27):4705-4706). Both the 2-chlorotrityl chloride and 4-hydroxyTnethyl"3-methoxyphenoxy butyric acid resins may be purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA.<br>
General procedures for production and loading of resins which can be utilized in solid phase peptide synthesis are described hereinâ€¢  Resin loading can be performed, for example, via the folloWing techniques:  The resin, preferably a super acid sensitive resin such as 2-chlorotrityl resin, is charged to the reaction chamber.  The resin is washed with a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM).  The bed is drained and a solution of 1.5 equivalents of an amino acid and 2.7 equivalents of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in about S-lO volumes of dichloroethane (DCE) is added.  The N-terminus of the amino acid should be protected, preferably with Fmoc, and the side chain of the amino acid should be protected where necessary or appropriare.  The mixture is agitated with nitrogen bubbling for 2 hours.<br>
It should be nored that a chlorinated solvent is required for adequate swelling of the 2-chlorozrityl resin. Although DCE provides greater loading efficiency according zo literature sources, DCM may be substituted with little or no reduction in the loading.<br>
After agitation, the bed is drained and washed with DCM. The active sites on the resin are endcapped with a 9:1 MeOH:DIEA solution for about 2 0-3 0 minutes.  The bed is drained, washed 4x with DCM and dried with a nitrogen purge to give the loaded resin.<br>
Fmoc is the preferred protecting group for the N-terminus of the amino acid.  Depending on which amino acid is being loaded, its side chain may or may not be protected. For example, when Trp is loaded, its side chain should be protected with Boc.  Similarly, the side-chain of Gin may be protected with trt.  However, when Gin is being loaded in'<br><br>
preparation for the synthesis of the 1-16 peptiae tragment, its side chain should not be protected.  It is not necessary to protect the side-chain of Leu.<br>
The Fmoc-protected amino acids used in loading the resin and in peptide synthesis are available; with or without side-chain protecting groups as required, from Sean or Genzyme. As an alternative to the above procedure, the resin may be purchased already loaded With the appropriate amino acid.<br>
The Examples presented in Section 6, below, describe exemplary resin preparations.<br>
Solid phase peptide synthesis techniques can be performed as, for example, according to the following techniques:  The loaded resin is added to the reaction chamber and conditioned with a solvent, preferably methylene chloride (DCM; at preferably about 10 vol.) with nitrogen agitation for about 15 minutes to sWell the resin beads.  DCM is required for adequate sWelling of the 2-chlorotrityl resin.  The resin volume Will double or triple in the reaction chamber as the beads swell and the active sites unfold and become accessible to reaction.  After the resin is sWelled, the solvent is drained from the reaction chamber.<br>
Removal of the Fmoc (9-fluroenyl-methyloxycarbonyl) protecting group from the terminal amine or the resin is accomplished by treating the resin with 2 aliquots of a 20% solution of piperidine in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) for about ten minutes each.  The volume of the 20% solution of piperidine in NMP required for each aliquot will depend on the scale of the reaction being run.  The resin is then washed 5-7 times with aliquots of ITMP (aboutlO vol.) to remove the Fmoc by-products (i.e., dibenzofulvene and its piperidine adduct) and residual piperidine.<br>
A chloranil test may be used to determine if the removal of Fmoc by-products and residual pyridine is complete.  The chloranil test solution is prepared by adding a drop of a saturated solution of chloranil in toluene to about 1 mL of acetone.  The NMP washings may be tested by adding a drop of<br><br>
the Washing to the chloranil test solution.  A blue or violet color is a positive indication for the presence of secondary amine, indicating that Fmoc by-products and/or residual piperidine are still present.  The NMP washing is repeated until the blue or violet color is no longer observed.'<br>
Meanwhile, the subsequent amino acid in the sequence to be added to the resin is activated for reaction at its carboxy terminus-  The amine terminus of each amino acid should be protected with Fmoc.  Depending on which amino acid is being added, its side chain may or may not be protected. Preferably, the side-chains of tyr(Y), Thr(T), Ser(S) and Asp(P) are protected with t-Bu, the side-chains of His(H), Gln(Q) and Asn(N) are protected with trt, and the side-chains of Lys(K) and Trp(W) are protected With Boc.  However, as discussed above, the side-chain of His must be protected. Moreover, it is preferred not to protect the side-chain of the Gin residue at the carboxy-terminal end of fragments 1-16 and 9-16.  It is not necessary for the side-chains of Len or lie to be protected.<br>
The amino acid is activated as follows.  The Fmoc-protected amino acid (1.5 eq), l-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) (1,5 eq), and diisopropyl-ethylamine (DIEA) (1.5 eq) are dissolved in NMP (about 7.5 vol.) at room temperature. The solution is chilled to O-S'C, and then O-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) (1.5 eq) is added followed by stirring for 5-15 minutes to dissolve.  It is important that activation is carried out at low temperature to minimize racemization of the amino acid. The HBTU is the last reagent added to the cold solution since activation and racemization cannot take place in its absence.<br>
The solution of activated amino acid is charged to the drained resin, washing in with DCM (approximately 2.5 vol). Note that activation of the amino acid is carried out in NMP due to the insolubility of HBTU in DCM.  However, DCM is added to the reaction at this point to maintain adequate sWelling of the resin beads.  The reaction is agitated with N.<br><br>
bubbling for about l hour.  Coupling completion may be monitored with a qualitative ninhydrin test as described below.<br>
To check for completion of the reaction using the qualitative ninhydrin test, a 2-20 mg sample of the resin is withdrawn and washed clean with methanol.  To the sample is added 3 drops of a 76% solution of phenol in ethanol, 4 or 5 drops of a 0.2 ml'l KCN solution in pyridine, and 3 drops of a 0.28 M solution of ninhydrin in ethanol.  The sample is diluted with ethanol to a volume of about 0.5 mL and placed in a heat bloc}: at about 750C for 5-10 minutes,  A blue or violet color is a positive indication for the presence of free amines, indicating thar the reaction is not yet complete.  The sample can be diluted further to a volume of about 3 mL to more easily gauge the degree of color change in the concentrated sample.<br>
If a positive ninhydrin test is observed after one hour, the coupling reaction is continued for an additional hour. If the positive ninhydrin test persists after 2 hours, the resin is drained, washed three times in approximately 10 volumes of NT-IP, and the coupling reaction is repeated using 1 equivalent of activated amino acid-<br>
If the resin is to be stored overnight betv:een coupling cycles, the resin bed may be drained and covered With DCM under a nitrogen blanket.  Alternatively, the bed may be drained, stored under a nitrogen blanket, then conditioned with a DCM wash prior to proceeding with the next coupling cycle.  If the completed fragment is to be stored overnight prior to cleavage, the resin bed should be Washed free of Nl-IP with DCM because significant Fmoc deprotection can occur in NMP.<br>
After the coupling is judged complete, the resin is drained and washed with 3 aliquots (approximately 10 vol.) of IMP.     The cycle is repeated for subsequent mers of the peptide fragment.  Following the final coupling reaction,  the resin is washed with 4 aliquots (about 10 vol.) of NMP, then<br><br>
with 4 aliquots (approximately 10 vol.) of DCM.  The resin-bound peptide may be dried with a nitrogen purge.<br>
Peptides synthesized via solid phase synthesis techniques can be cleaved and isolated according to, for example, the following techniques:  The peptide may be cleaved from the resin using techniques well knoWn to those skilled in the art.  For example, solutions of 1% or 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM or a combination of a 1% and a 2% solution of TFA in DCM may be used to cleave the peptide.  Acetic acid (HOAC) may also be used to cleave the peptide.  The specific cleavage reagent, solvents and time required for cleavage will depend on the particular peptide being cleaved.  After cleavage the cleavage fractions are subjected to srandard work-up procedures to isolate the peptide.  Typically, the combined cleavage fractions are concentrated under vacuum, followed by reconstitution With a solvent such as ethanol, methanol or heptane.  In general, the peptide is precipitated by the addition of Water, and collected by vacuum filtration.  Alternatively, the product may be triturated prior to isolation of the peptide.<br>

For synthesis of full length T-20 peptides, the peptide intermediates of Table 1, above, can be coupled together to yield the T-20 peptide.  For example, the groups of peptide intermediates listed in Table 2, above, can be coupled together to produce T-20 full-length peptide.  Representative exam.ples of such synthesis of full-length T-20 from intermediate peptide fragments are presented in Section 9, below, and are d epicted schematically in FIGS. 1-5.<br>
In certain embodiments, a four fragment approach for synthesis of T-20 can be followed.  A "four fragment approach" synthesis refers to a T-20 synthesis scheme Which begins with four T-2 0 intermediate peptide fragments that _are synthesized and coupled using solid and liquid phase<br><br>

Intermediate peptide fragment groups 5, 6, 8, 9 and 12-15 shoWn in Table 2, above, represent preferred groups-  FIGS, i and 2 depict two four fragment approaches which utilize Table 2 peptide intermediate Group 6 to synthesize full-length T-20,  For this group, it is noted that amino acid residue 36 (the T-20 carboxy 1-terminal amino acid residue) is introduced individually during the fragment coupling process. The culmination of the T-20 synthesis scheme shown in FIG. 1 is demonstrated in the example presented in Section 9.1.<br>

A "three fragment approach" synthesis refers to a T-2 0 synthesis scheme Which begins with three T-20 intermediate peptide fragments that are synthesized and coupled using solid and liquid phase synthesis techniques into a full-length T-20 peptide. Intermediate fragment groups 2-4, 7, 10 and 11 shown in Table 2, above, represent preferred three fragment groups.  FIGS. 3 and 4 depict two three fragment approaches which utilize Table 2 peptide intermediate Group 3 to synthesize full-length T-20.  For this group, it is noted that amino acid residue 36 (the T-20 carboxyl-terninal amino acid residue) is introduced individually during the fragment coupling process. The culmination of the T-20 synthesis scheme shown in FIG. 3 is demonstrated in the example presented in Section 9.1, below.  The culmination of the T-2 0 synthesis scheme shown in FIG. 4 is demonstrated ir the examples presented in Sections 9.2-9.5, below.<br>

Procedure;<br>
A 25 mL round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar was charged with HAAI-36NH2 (as synthesized in Section 9.3, above), DMF (10 mL) , pyridine (0.046 mL) and acetic anhydride (0.027 mL) (note i).  The somtion was stirred at<br><br>
room temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 4 hours (note 2).  Water (7.5 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (7.5 mL) was added to precipitate the protected peptide.  The solids were collected by vacuum filtration, washed with water (10 mL) and dried to give 0.65g of AcAAl-36NH2 in 91% yield and 90A% purity by HPLC (note 3).<br>

The Example presented in this Section demonstrates the successful coupling of solid and liquid phase synthesis techniques to produce a T-20 peptide from peptide intermediate fragments.  In particular, the synthesis route described here represents the T-20 three fragment approach shown in FIG. 4.<br><br><br>
Procedure;<br>
A somtion of 90:5:5 (WWwt %) trifmoroacetic acid/water/dithiothreitol was degassed with nitrogen and cooled to 0-5Â°C.  To the cooled somtion was added AcAAl-SGNH' (as synthesized in Section 9.4, above).  The smrry was stirred at O-S'C until the solids dissolved (- 5 minutes) then warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2.5 hours. The somtion was added to 0-5Â°C MTBE (70 mL) to precipitate the peptide.  The smrry was spun in a centrifuge for five minutes at 2200 rpm and the MTBE decanted from the solids. The solids were again suspended in MTBE (50 mL),   spun in a centrifuge for five minutes at rpm and the MTBE was decanted. This process was repeated once more then the solids were dissolved in 1:1 water/acetonitrile (30 mL) containing 1 vol% acetic acid and stored at room temperature for 24 hours (note 1).  The somtion was frozen then freeze dried using a lyopholyzer to give 155 mg of crude T-20.  Purification by preparative HPLC provides 5 5 mg of the full-length T-20 peptide in 95A% purity by HPLC (note 2).<br><br>

1.	Commn with approximately 6 commn vommes of 2 0% B.<br>
2.	T-20 is dissolved in 50-100 mL of 85%A/15%B per gram of peptide.  The pH is adjusted to 8-10 with 2M K.CO3.  The acetonitrile concentration in the T-20 sample does not exceed 15-20%.<br>

RESULTS<br>
T--20 peptide is much more somble at pK ranges greater than 7.  Commn supporrs commonly used to purify peptides are silica-based and can, therefore, only be used at pH ranges because silica support tends to dissolve at higher pH ranges.<br>
The method described herein utilizes a polystyrene-based resin supporr that is stable at a broad pH range (pH 1-14). This method greatly increases the capacity of the commn in that T-20 throughput increased from lOg up to 250-450g (for an 8" diameter x 30 cm commn)â€¢<br><br>
11.  EXAMPLE:  LARGE SCALE SYNTHESIS AND PURIFICATION OF<br>
T-2Q PEPTIDE RESIK LOADING	<br>
FmocTrp(Boc)OK can be loaded on very active 2-CTC resin at levels of 1.2 mmole./g of starting resin or higher.  At levels over 1.1 nmole of FiiiocTrp(Boc) OH per gram of starting resin (over 0.72 mmol/g on loaded resin), it is difficult to obtain negative ninhydrin tests for the last three amino acids of the fragment.  Likewise, it becomes difficult to build FmocAA17-260-resin when the FmocLeuO-resin is loaded greater than 0.85 mmole/g and AcAAl-160-resin when FmocGlnOK-resin is loaded greater then 0.75 mmole/g.<br>
Upon receipt of the resin from the vendor, a use test with about 1 g of 2-CTC resin is conducted with each amino acid to be loaded. The purpose of the use test is to determine the quanrity of amino acid to be used during loading to obtain the desired loading range.  Use O.S, l.o and 1.5 equivalents of FmocGlnOH, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 equivalents of FmocTrp(Boc)OH and O.S, 1.0 and 1.5 equivalents of FmocLeuOH with 0.5 equivalent excess of DIEA for each (relative to the reported activity of the resin). If 1 mole of FmocLeuOH cannot be loaded onto 1 Kg of 2-CTC resin, the 2-CTC should not be accepted from the vendor. Below is a description of the targeted resin load for FmocLeuOH, FmocGlnOH and FmocTrp(Boc)OH.<br>
From 1.0 to 1.1 moles of FmocLeuOH can be loaded onto each Kg of 2-CTC resin. Taking inro account loss of HCl, the dry weight of the resin after loading FmocLeuOH should be 1.3 2 ,to 1.3 5 times the weight of starting resin and the measured loading should be 0.75 to 0-Sl mmole/g.<br>
From 0.8 to 1.0 moles of FmocGlnOH can be loaded onto each Kg of 2-CTC resin. Taking into account loss of HCL, the dry Weight of the resin after loading FmocGlnOH should be 1.27 to 1.3 3 times the weight of starting resin and the measured loading should be 0.63 to 0.75.<br>
From 0.9 to 1.1 moles of FmocTrp(Boc)OH can be loaded onto each Kg of 2-CTC resin.  Taking into account loss of HCL, the dry weight of the resin after loading FmocTrp(Boc)OH<br><br>
should be 1.44 to 1.54 times the weight of starting resin and the measured loading should be 0.63 to 0.72.<br>
For accurate Weight gain analysis, the loss on drying (LOD) of the starting resin must be determined. It should not exceed 1%. If residual solvent (or DIEA/HCl) is not completely removed from the resin during drying (after the loading) , then the isolated mass Will be higher and the measured loading lover. However, the total moles loaded (mass times measured loading) should fall within the above mentioned ranges. If the high-end loading level is exceeded (or total moles loaded per Kg of starting resin) for any of the amino acids mentioned, by over 10%, run a use tesr using less amino acid. This is particularly important for FmocGlnOH.<br>
11.1 Large Scale Preparation of Fmoc-AA(BGC)-2-<br>
Chlorotritvl Resin	<br>
The purpose of the following section is to perform a<br>
large scale loading of resins suitable for preparation of<br>
high quantities of peptides for solid phase peptide synthesis<br>
(SPPS) .  The resin is charged With each of the follov:ing:<br>
FmocTrp(Boc)OH, and FmocGln(Boc)OH, and FmocLeu(Boc)OH.  Each<br>
starting residue was charged onto approximately 4 Kg of 2-CTC<br>
resin.<br><br>
Starting 2-CTC resin was purchased from Colorado BioTech with a reported loading of 1.4 meq/g.  The standard loading procedure, 1.5 eq of FmocTrp (Boc) OH, 1.7 eq of DIEA in DC!-f (5<br><br>
vol) , ambient temperature for 2 hours, was used starting with 3.7 Kg of 2-CTC.  This provided 4.493 Kg of FmocTrp(Boc)0-resin that had a loading calculated at 0.56 mmol/g (2.52 moles total) by Weight based HPLC assay of FmocTrp (Boc)OH after cleavage from the resin. By weight gain of the resin, the loading is calculated to be 0.3 6 mmol/g for a total of 1.62 moles prepared.  However, if the 12% LOD on the starting 2-CTC resin is taken into account, the loading calculated by weight gain is the same at 0.56 mmole/g for a total of 2.52 moles, well short of the targeted loading of 4 moles FmocTrp(Hoc)OH per 4 Kg of resin.<br>
A total of 4.59 Kg of FmocLeuO-resin was prepared from 3.9 Kg of 2-CTC in tWo runs using standard loading procedures.<br>
However, a substantially lower loading than was anticipated was obtained.  The first batch had a calculated loading of 1.07 mmol/g by v:eight based HPLC analysis of FmocLeuOH after clevage from the resin-  This is clearly impossible as the loading calculated by weight gain taking I into account the 12% LOD on the starting 2--CTC resin, is (500 g) 0.647 mmole/g.  The actual loading is likely close to 0.647 mmole/g for a total of 1.577 moles loaded.<br>
A second batch of FmocLeu-0-resin prepared (2.154 Kg) from 1.7 Kg of 2-CTC had a calculated loading of 0.63 mmole/g versus a weight gain loading of 0.66 mmole/g.<br>
A total of 3.856 Kg of FmocGlnO-resin was prepared in a single batch starting with 3.65 Kg of 2-CTC using 0.8 eq of FmocGlnOH and 1 eq of DIEA in 7 vommes of 5/2 DMF/DCM.  The substitution calculated by weight based HPLC assay was 0.55 mmol/g for a total of 2.12 moles of FmocGlnO-resin.  The loading calculated by Weight gain taking into account the 12% LOD of the starting 2-CTC resin is 0.52 mmol/g for a total of 2.0 moles FmocGlnO-resin.<br>
Generally, the loading by weight gain should be greater ' than or equal to the loading calculated by a weight based HPLC assay against the AA loaded or fulvene removed.  The-<br><br>
starting 2-CTC should have less than 1% LOD ana tne isoiatea FinocAAOresin will likely have a small amount of Nl-IP, salt and/or residual FinocAAOH.<br>
11.1.1   Preferred Method for Large Scale<br>
Preparation of Fmoc-AA(Boc)-2-<br>
Chlorotritvl Resin	<br>
FmocTrp(Boc)OH and FmocLeuOH<br>
The air sensitive 2-Chlorotritylchloride resin (l eq, 3.7, Kg, 5.18 mole) is added to a SPPS chamber and Washed With 5 vommes of DCM. The solvent is drained and a somtion of either FmocTrp(Boc)OH or FmocLeu(Hoc)OH (1.5 eq) and DIEA (1.7 eq) in DCM (5 vol) is added (note 1).  The smrry is agitated with stirring for 2 hours-  The solvent is drained and the remaining active sites en the resin are end-capped with 9:1 MeOH:DIEA (5 vol) for 30 minutes.  The solvent is drained and the resin is washed With 6x5 vommes of DCM. The resin is dried to constant weight, then sampled and analyzed for loading (note 2).  The same procedure is used for loading FmocLeuOH. FmocGmOH<br>
The air-sensitive 2-CTC (3.65 Kg, 1.4 mmole/g) resin is charged into a 40L SPPS chamber under an atmosphere of nitrogen and Washed with DCM (5 vol) .  A 2 0L reactor is charged with FmocGlnOH (1.506 Kg, 0.8 eq), DMF (5 vol) and DIEA (1.0 eq).  The SPPS chamber is drained and the DMF somtion is added.  The reactor is rinsed with DCM (2 vol) and the rinse added to the SPPS chamber.  The resin is stirred in the SPPS chamber under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours and drained. Any remaining active sites on the resin are capped with 9:1 Methanol:DIEA (5 vol) for 3 0 minutes. The resin is drained, washed with DCM (6x5 vol) and dried to constant weight (3.856 Kg).  The resin is sampled and tested for loading level (note 2).<br>
Notes:<br><br>
1.   The 2-Chlorotritylchloride resin is very sensitive to<br>
moister. Water caps the resin and yields HCl.  As long<br>
as the solvent is dry, there is little difference<br>

Determination of the load by weight gain of the resin can be inaccurate as the number of washes used prior to drying the resin may not be sufficient to completely remove NMP from the resin.  The calculation is:<br>
(Mass Fmoc-AA-QH-resin - Mass of stating 2-070'/Mass Fmoc-AA-OH-resin {mi  of AA loaded - IW KCl)<br>
It was observed that storing the peptide fragments of the present invention for prolonged periods of time (days) in DCM results in substantial cleavage from the resin.  For example, during the course of building FmocAA17-2 60H, the partially built fragment was stored over the weekend twice in DCM.  An 8% yield of FmocAA17-260H was obtained after com.pletion of the synthesis and removal from the resin.  It ' is suspected that trace HCl in the DCM slowly cleaved the partially built fragment from the resin during the weekend storage.<br>
Samples of FmocAA17-260-resin, AcAAl-160-resin and FrmoAA27-350-resin were allowed to stand in DCM and IPA at room temperature for 1 week.  The supernatant for each was analyzed by HPLC.  Although quantitative results were not '<br><br>
obtained; all the fragments were cleaved from the resin to a significant extent in DCM while cleavage in IPA was not observed.  If partially built fragments need to be stored for a few days (over the weekend), it is better to rinse the solids With NMP, drain the bed and let it stand saturated with ITMP under a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
DCM was replaced with IPA for the final washes of FmocLeuO-resin, FmocGlnO-resin, FmocTrp (Boc)0"-resin, FmocAA17-2 60-resin, AcAAl-160-resin and FrmoAA27-350-resin. The IPA saturated FmocLeuO-resin, FmocGlnO-resin and FmocTrp(Boc)0-resin were dried at 40Â°C.  FmocAA17-260-resin, AcAAl-160-resin, and FrmoAA27-3 50-resin were built from the loaded resins that were dried at 4Â°C.  At completion of the synthesis, the resin bound fragments Were washed clean with DOM followed by IPA.  The IPA saturated, resin "bound fragments were  divided and dried at ambient temperature and 40'C.  The fragments were cleaved from the resin and analyzed by HPLC.  There were no observed differences in the fragment purity.  Drying IPA saturated, resin bound fragments at 4 0Â°C does not impact the quality or quantity of the fragment isolated.<br>
SPPS of the fragments in DMF as opposed to NI-IP/DCM was examined (1 g of resin swells, to 5 mL in both solvent systems).  Fragment FmocAA27-350H was synthesized using DMF as a solvent and TBTU vs HBTU as a coupling reagent. FmocAA27-j50H was isolated in 77% yield and 89.5A% purity.<br>
The work up protocol for fragments FmocAA17-3 6NH2 and ACAAI-36NH2 removes the uncoupled fragments.  Acetylating (endcapping) these fragments at deletion sites during the solid phase synthesis Will ensure that the deletion fragments do not couple in the somtion phase couplings. The uncoupled fragments in the synthesis of both FmocAA17-3 6NH2 and AcAAl-3 6NH2 should be removed in the IPA and ACN work ups.<br><br>
11.2 Large Scale Preparation of Fragment Ac-AA(1-<br>
16)-OH (Fragment 3c)	<br>
Large scale preparation by SPPS of fragment AcAAl-160H was conducted in two runs yielding a total of 7.941 Kg of resin bound fragment from 3.53 Kg of FmocGlnOH-resin.  The loading vame for the starting FmocGlnOH-resin in both runs was the somewhat overestimated 0.55 mmol/g vame obtained from a weight based HPLC assay rather then the more accurate 0.52 mmol/g obtained by weight gain taking into account 12% LOD on the starting 2-CTC.  In addition to having the resin loading lower then desired, a 6% excess of each amino acid was used during the SPPS.<br>
The SPPS used 2.5 equivalents of the first FmocGln(trt)OH onto the resin, and 1.7 equivalent of each of the subsequent amino acids in the fragment (relative to the 0.55 mmol/g loading).  The coupling reactions were conducted in 8 vommes of 3:1 NMP:DCM and all the but two of the 32 coupling reactions (acetylation incmded) went to completion within 2 hours.  All washes were done with 5 vommes of l'fl-IP.<br>
The resin-bound fragment is Washed with 5 to 6 times in 3.4 vommes (relative to the Weight of the dry AcAAl-160-resin) of 1% TFA/DCM at 0-5'C,   5 minutes per wash.  Each wash is collected onto 1.36 vommes of 0.33 M aq NaHCO, to neutralize the TFA.  The triphasic Washes are combined and water (2 vol) is added.  The DCM is removed by distillation leaving a filterable precipitate in the aqueous sodium bicarbonate.  During the course of the distillation, the multi-phasic smrry becomes viscous and cream-like before collapsing into a filterable smrry as the last of the DCM is removed.  The smrry is cooled to 0-5 Â°C and the pH is adjusted to 3.0 with 0.1 N HCl.  The smrry was stirred at 0-5 0C  for 1-2 hours, collected by filtration, washed and dried.  In the remaining runs the solids were collected, returned to the reactor and triturated with water for 1-2 hour, then collected and dried.<br><br>
Cleavage of AcAAl-160H from the resin was accomplished in four runs using 1% TFA in DCM.  A total of 4.814 Kg of AcAAl-ieOH Was produced from 3.53 Kg of Fm.ocGlnO-resin in 93-96A% purity.  The overall yield based on the 0.52 mmol/g loading determined by weight gain taking into account the 12% LOD of the starting 2-CTC (5.83 Kg theoretical) is 83%.<br>
The sodium salt of AcAAi-160H is insomble in DMF and NMP, therefore, the pH adjustment is needed to protonate the carboxyl terminus.  The water wash ensures removal of the sodium trifmoroacetate from the product.  A very small amount of sodium trifmoroacetate on a wt/wt basis will interfere with the somtion-phase coupling with HAA17-36NH2.<br>
This fragment should be dried at ambient temperature.  A stability study locking at drying wet AcAAl-160H at 40 'C showed about 4% degradation over 3 days.  Interestingly, the dry solid is stable at BO'C for 24 hours.<br>
11.2.1   Preferred Method of Large Scale<br>
Preparation of Fragment Ac-AA(1-16)-<br>
OH(Fragment 3c)	<br>
To a 40 L peptide chamber is added the resin-bound FmocGlnOH (1.53 Kg, 0.55 mmol/g, 0.84 mole).  The resin is conditioned with DCM (5 vol) under nitrogen with agitation for 15 minutes, then drained.  A 20% piperidine in NMP somtion (5 vol) is added and the suspension is stirred under nitrogen for 20 minutes.  The somtion is drained and the process repeated.  The resin is washed 5 times with 5 vommes of NMP to remove dibenzofulvene and piperidine as determined by a chloranil test (note 1).<br>
V7hile the resin is being washed clean of piperidine, the subsequent amino acid in the sequence (1.5 eq) , HOBT (1.5 eq) and DIEA (1.5 eq) are combined in Nl-IP (6-7 vol) and cooled to 0Â°C. To the cool somtion is added HBTU (1.5 eq) and the somtion is stirred for 10-15 minutes to dissolve the HBTU. The cooled somtion of activated amino acid is added to the resin followed by a DCM rinse (2.5 vol) (note 2),  The suspension is stirred under nitrogen purge for 2 hours, then<br><br>
a sample of the resin is removed for a qualitative ninhydrin test (note 3).  If the ninhydrin test is negative, the vessel is drained, washed with 3 times 5 vommes of NI4P (note 4) and the cycle is repeated with the next amino acid in the sequence. If the test is positive, the suspension is agitated for an additional hour and retested.  If the ninhydrin is negative, proceed to the next cycle.  If the ninhydrin remains positive, recouple with one eq of the amino acid and reagents.  If the ninhydrin is positive after one hour, endcap With Seq of acetic anhydride and Seq of pyridine in NMP (10 vol) for one hour.<br>
At completion of the fragment synthesis, the Fmoc is removed from the last amino acid as described and the resin is stirred in a somtion of acetic anhydride and pyridine (5 eq each) in 3:1 N1-IP:DCM (10 vol) for 2 0-3 0 minutes or until a negative ninhydrin test is obtained. The resin is drained, washed with 2X5 vommes of l-n-IP, 5 times with 5 vommes of DCM and dried yielding 3.49 Kg of AcAAl-160-resin.<br>
The 40 L SPPS chamber is charged With the dried, resin-' bound AcAAl-16 (3.49 Kg).  The resin-bound peptide is cleaved from the resin using 6 X 3.4 vommes of 1% TFA/DCM (note 7). Each cleavaae wash is collected onto 1.36 vommes of 0.33 M aq. sodium bicarbonate.  The biphasic fractions are combined and dimted with 2 vommes of v:ater.  The biphasic mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure (15 in Hg, 20 'C) to remove DCK.  Additional Water (2 vommes) is added during the distillation as needed to maintain stirring (note 6) .  V7hen the DCM is removed (several hours), the suspension is cooled to 0 Â°C and the pH is adjusted to 3 with IN aq HCl,  The smrry is stirred at 0 0C for 1 hr and collected. The still damp solid is returned to the reaction vessel and triturated with water (7 vommes) to remove residual TFA and sodium trifmoroacetate.  The solids are collected by vacuum filtration and dried to a constant weight (1.12 Kg, 95A%). The yield AcAAl-160H based on 0.52 mmol/g load is 86% (note 7).<br><br>
Notes;<br>
1.	To approximately 1 mL of acetone is added 1 drop of a saturated somtion if chloranil in tomene, folloWed by one drop of effment, A bme or violet color is a positive indication for the presence of a piperidine. As the bed height increases, larger vommes of ITl-IP will be needed to wash out the piperidine.<br>
2.	DCM is added to ensure adequate swelling of the resin.<br>
3.	Quantitative ninhydrin testing is adequate for monitoring the coupling efficiency. A 2-20 mg sample of the resin is withdraWn and washed clean with methanol. To the sample is added 3 drops of 76% phenol in ethanol, 4 drops of 0.2 mid KCN in pyridine and 3 drops of 0.28 M ninhydrin in ethanol. The somtion is dimted to 0.5-1 mL with ethanol and placed in a heat block at VS'C for 5-10 minutes. A bme or violet color indicates free amines (positive). Clear or faint bme is a negative result.  Protocol for Quantitative Ninhydrin Test References:  Sarin, V. K., Kent, S. B. H., Tarn, J. P., &amp; Merrifield, R- B. (1981) Analytical Biochem. iii, 147-157.<br>
4.	If the resin is to be stored overnight, wash With 2 times 5 vommes of Nl-IP, drain and store under nitrogen. Do not store under DCM.  This can result in cleavage of the peptide from the resin and substantial mass loss-<br>
5.	Each fraction is tested for product content by TLC visualization at 254 nm.  The majority of the product is removed in the first 5 washes.<br>
6.	As the DCM is removed, the reaction takes on the consistency of marshmallow cream. As the distillation continues, the suspension gradually breaks into a solid smrry. It is important to remove the DCM slowly to avoid product oil-out.<br>

11.3 Large Scale Preparation of Fragment FmocAA(17-<br>
26)-OH(Fragment 10b)	<br>
A total of 5.3 Kg of FmocAA17-260-resin was prepared from 2.4 Kg of FmocLeuO-resin in two, equal size runs.  The 5.3 Kg of FmocLeuO-resin was cleaved from the resin in four equal size runs yielding 3.184 Kg of FmocAA17-260H averaging 94.4A% purity and 90% yield.<br>
The reactiions were run using 1.5 equivalent of each amino acid relative to the loading factor, resulting in the use of 65% excess of amino acid for each coupling cycle.  All of the coupling reactions Were com.plete (negative ninhydrin test) within 2 hours.<br>
The Fmoc protecting group was rem.oved with 2 0% piperidine in IIMP (5 vommes) for 20 minutes and repeated. The piperidine was washed out of the resin With 5x5 vomme 'â€¢IP washes.  The coupling reactions were run in 8 vommes of 3:1 N1-IP:DCM.  The coupling somtion was drained and the solids Were cleaned With three, 5 vomme Nl-IP washes.  The cycle Was repeated with the next amino acid in the sequence. At completion of the fragment, the resin bed was Washed with 2x5 vommes of NMP, 5x5 vommes of DCM and dried to constant weight.<br>
Several 1% TFA in DCM washes are used to remove the fragment from the resin.  Cooling the 1% TFA in DCM somtion is not necessary as the stability of this fragment in 1% TFA/DCM (1%/day) is much greater then AcAAl-160H.  As the product containing, acidic DCM washes are collected, they are neutralized with pyridine.  The combined washes are distilled to remove DCM and ethanol is added to maintain a somtion as well as to drive the remaining DCM out during the distillation.  After the DCM has been removed (determined by an increase in the temperature of the distillate being removed) water was added to precipitate the fragment.  The<br><br>
solid was collected by vacuum filtration (less than 60 minutes) .  The still damp solid was transferred back to the reactor and triturated with 80/20 ethanol/water (5 vol) at 0-5 0C for 60 minutes.  The precipitated FmocAA17-2 60H Was collected by vacuum filtration, ashed With a minimal amount of 80/20 ethanol/water and dried (vacuum, no heat, 10 days).<br>

Preparation of Fragment FmocAA(17-2 6)-<br>
OH(Fracnnent lOb)	<br>
A 4 0L SPPS chamber is charged With FmocLeuO-resin (1.2 Kg, 0.776 mole) followed by DCM (5 vol) to swell the resin. The DCM is needed to ensure complete sWelling of the dried starting resin.  The suspension is stirred for 20-30 minutes and drained.  A 20% piperidine in ITI'P somtion is added (5 vol) and the somtion is stirred for 20 minutes.  The solvent is drained and the process is repeated.  The solvent is drained and the resin bed is Washed with 5x5 vommes of OTIP to remove piperidine (note 1).<br>
V7hile deprotecting, a 20 L round bottom flask With mechanical stirred is charged with the next amino acid in the sequence (1.95 eq) , HOBT (1.95 eq) , DIEA (1.95 eq) and NT-'P (6 vol).  The somtion is stirred until the solids dissolve, then cooled to 0-5 0c and KBTU (1.95 eq) is added.  The somtion is stirred until the HBTU dissolves or the resin if free of piperidine (whichever is first), then added to the resin.  The reactor is Washed With DCM (2 vol) and this is transferred to the SPPS reactor.  Note: The stoichiometry of amino acid and reagents should be 1.5 equivalents.<br>
The resin is suspended in coupling somtion with gentle stirring.  After two hours, a sample of resin is removed from the SPPS chamber and a qualitative ninhydrin test is performed (note 2)-  If the ninhydrin test is negative, the vessel is drained, Washed with 3 times 5 vommes of NMP and the cycle is repeated With the next amino acid in the sequence (the DCM swelling is used only for the first amino acid loaded).<br><br>
If the test is positive, the suspension is agitated for an additional hour and retested.  If the ninhydrin is negative, proceed to the next cycle.  If the ninhydrin remains positive, recouple With one eq of the amino acid and reagentsâ€¢  If the ninhydrin is positive after one hour, endcap with 5 eq of acetic anhydride and 5 eq of pyridine in N&gt;IP (10 vol) for one hour.<br>
At completion of the fragment synthesis, the resin is drained, washed with 2X5 vommes of N14P, 5X5 vommes of DCM and dried yielding 2.67 Kg of FmocAA17-260-resin.<br>
FmocAA17-260H is cleaved from the resin (1.33 Kg) using 5-6 X 1.7 vommes of 1% TFA in DCM, 5 minutes each. The 1% TFA/DCM washes are collected in a flask containing pyridine (1:1 vomme ratio with the TFA in the wash).  The product containing washes are combined (approximately 14 L) and the DCM is removed by distillation to a minimum pot vomme (approximately one third of the original vomme).  The vacuum is adjusted to maintain a pot temperature of 15-25 0C, Ethanol (6.5 vol) is added and the distillation is continued until the DCM is removed (as determined by the temperature of the distillate, note 3).  Again the vacuum is adjusted to maintain a pot temperature of 15-20 0C.  The final pot vomme should be approximately S-10 vommes. The somtion is cooled to 5-lOÂ°C and water (6.5 vol) is added over 30 minutes to precipitate the FmocAA17-260H.  The solid is collected by vacuum filtration and washed with water (2-3 vol).  To remove residual pyridine and/or salts, the still damp solid is charged back to the reactor and 80/20 ethanol/water (5 vol) , preceded to 0Â°C, is added.  The suspension is stirred at O'C for 60 minutes, the solids are collected by vacuum filtration, washed with a minimal amount of 80/20 ethanol/water and dried to constant Weight to give 0.806 Kg of FmocAA17-260H in 90.6% yield and 96A% purity (note 4).<br><br>
Notes;<br>
1	To 1 mL of acetone is added 1 drop of a saturated somtion of chloranil in tomene, folloWed by 1 drop of effment. A bme or violet color indicates the presence of piperidine.<br>
2	Quantitative ninhydrin testing is adequate for monitoring the coupling efficiency. A 2-20 mg sample of the resin is withdrawn and washed clean with methanol. To the sample is added 3 drops of 76% phenol in ethanol, 4 drops of 0.2 mM KCN in pyridine and 3 drops of 0.28 M ninhydrin in ethanol. The somtion is dimted to 0.5-1 mL with ethanol and placed in a heat block at VS'C for 5-10 minutes. A bme or violet color indicates free amines (positive). Clear or faint bme is a negative result.<br>

AA(27-35)-OH(Fragment I6b)	<br>
A total of 4.694 Kg of FmocAA27-3 50H. was synthesized<br>
from 4.45 Kg of FmocTrp(Boc)0-resin.  The solid phase<br>
synthesis was run in two batches and cleavage from the resin<br>
was four batches.  FmocAA27-3 50H resulting from one batch Was<br>
about 5% less pure than material from the other batch.  This<br>
was due to an unidentified, 5A% impurity that was removed in<br>
processing to FmocAA17-3 6NH2.  The total amount of<br>
FmocTrp(Boc)OH loaded onto the resin was 2.5 moles.  The<br>
solid phase synthesis proceeded as expected for resin loaded<br>
at about 63% of capacity.  All of the couplings were complete<br><br>
at the first, 2 hour check point.  The reaction and rinse vomines used for the SPPS and cleavage were the same as those used in the synthesis of FinocAA17"260H.  Cleavage from the resin was as described above.  Filtration was quick (15 min). ' Drying the solid after the 90/10 ethanol/water trituration took 3 days (vacuum, no heat).  The fragment is stable to drying at 40 'C.<br>
11.4.1   Preferred Method of Large Scale<br>
Preparation of Fragment Ac-AA(27-35)-<br>
OH(Fragment I6b)	<br>
To a SPPS chamber containing FmocTrp(Boc)-resin (1 eq, 2.2 Kg, 1.23 moles) is charged DCM (5 vol).  The suspension is suirred for 15 minutes and drained. A somtion of 20% piperidine in Nl-IP (5 vommes) is added and the suspension stirred for 10-15 minutes to remove the Fmoc protecting group.  This process is repeated and the resin is Washed with 5-7 X NI'IP (5 vol) to a negative chloranil test (note 1) .<br>
The subsequent amino acid (1.5 eg), HOBT (1.5 eq) and DIEA (1.7 eq) are combined in NT4P (6 vol), then cooled to 0-S'C (note 2) .  HBTU is added and the somtion is stirred for 10-15 minutes to dissolve.  The somtion of activated amino acid is added to the resin.  DCM (2 vol) is used to Wash the reactor then added to the resin (note 3).  The suspension is stirred under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 1-2 hours. Coupling completion is monitored w'ith a qualitative ninhydrin test (note 4).  If the ninhydrin test is negative, the vessel is drained, washed with 3 times 5 vol of NMP and the cycle is repeated with the next amino acid in the sequence (the DCM swelling is used only for the first amino acid loaded).<br>
If the test is positive, the suspension is agitated for an additional hour and retested.  If the ninhydrin is negative, proceed to the next cycle.  If the ninhydrin remains positive, recouple with one eq of the amino acid and reagents.  If the ninhydrin is positive after one hour, endcap with 5 eq of acetic anhydride and 5 eq of pyridine in NMP (10 vol) for one hour.<br><br>
At completion of the fragment synthesis, the resin is drained, washed With 2X5 vommes of NMP, 5X5 vommes of DCM and dried yielding 4.11 Kg of FmocAA27-350-resin.<br>
The fragment is cleaved from the resin (2.05 Kg) using 6 X 1.7 vommes of 1% TFA in DCM, 5 minutes each.  The 1% TFA/DCM washes are collected in a flask containing pyridine (1:1 vomme ratio with the TFA in the wash).  The product containing washes are combined and the DCM is removed by distillation (vacuum adjusted to maintain a pot temperature of approximately 15 Â°C)   to approximately one half of the original pot vomme.  Ethanol (5 vol) is gradually introduced and the distillation (vacuum adjusted to maintain a pot temperature of approximately 2 0 0C) is continued until the DCM is removed (as determined by the temperature of the distillate, note 5).  The pot vomme should be 6-7 vommes. The cloudy somtion is cooled to 10-15 "'C and Water (3.5 vol) is added over 3 0 minutes with rapid agitation to precipitate the FmocAA27-3 50H. The solids are collected by vacuum filtration (15 minutes) , and washed with water (1 vol) .  To remove residual pyridine, the damp solid is returned to the reactor and 90/10 ethanol/Water precooled to 0-5 'C is added (10 vol).  The smrry is stirred at 0-5 0C for 60 minutes, the solid is collected by vacuum filtration, Washed With 90/10 ethanol/water (0,5 vol) and dried to constant weight giving 1.19 Kg of FmocAA27-350H in 89% yield and 89.2A% purity (note 6).<br>
This protocol can be reworked by triturating the solid with 15 vommes of 9:1 ethanol/water With stirring for 12 hours, followed by collection and drying.<br>
Notes;<br>

FmocAA(27-35)-OH with HPheNH.	<br>
A total of 5.226 Kg of FmocAA27-3 6NH2was prepared in four runs from 4,676 Kg of FmocAA27-"3 50H.  Residual coupling reagents or solvent account for the greater then 100% yield. These are removed in the next stage.<br>
Solid sticking to the reactor wall after the water dropout was cited as a significant problem in this stage. Isolation of the crude solid by vacuum filtration took 30-<br><br>
minutes-  The average drying time (vacuum, no heat) for the runs was 8 days.  The solid needs to be compressed on the filter to remove excess water before it goes into the oven. TJJl' fragment is stable to drying at 4 0 'C and the vacuum ovens need to be heated.<br>
A use test is run on a 0.5 to 1 gram scale With the batch/lot of starting materials to be used to help establish quality and identity.  Thin Layer Chromatography (TCL) and HPLC are used to monitor conversion of starting material to product.  The primary impurity to look for in fragment FmocAA27-350H is trifmoroacetic acid (or a salt of it) . Activation and reaction of trifmoroacetic acid present in the FmocAA27-3 50H with the phenylalanine amide is a rapid process.  A small excess of phenylalanine amide can be used to consume any trifmoroacetic acid present.  A more significant quality issue is with the phenylalanine amide purchased.  Most vendors sell this as the HCl salt.  Several lots of the HCl salt of phenylalanine amide have produced an impurity (5-15A%) that co-emtes with the starting material on HPLC.  The impurity can be separated from the starting fragment and product by TLC.  The impurity is FmocAA27-35NH2 resulting from ammonium chlcride present in the HCl salt of phenylalanine amide.<br>

11.6 Large Scale Preparation of Fragment HAA(27-<br>
36)-OH from FmocAA(27-36)"OH	<br>
A total of 3.897 Kg of HAA27-3 6NH2was prepared from 5.221 Kg of FmocAA27-3 6NH2 in four runs with an average 2 step yield of 86.4%.  The range in yield observed for the runs, 74-97%, presumably reflects carryover from one run into the next.<br>
The work-up and product isolation in this stage works very well.  The purity of the product is enhanced if the correct amount of DCM is left in the MTBE and the physical properties of the solid lead to rapid filtration and drying. This product isolation process has been incorporated into the new stage described in Section 11.6.2, below.<br><br>
DCM is the solvent used during the deprotection of FxaocAA27-3 6NH2.  At completion of the deprotection, the organic somtion is washed With water twice to remove most of the excess piperidine, then concentrated to approximately one third of the original vomme.  MTBE is added to precipitate the fragment.  The distillation is continued to remove the majority of the remaining DCM and complete the precipitation of the fragment.  It is important to remove most of the DCM to avoid mass loss in the precipitation.  It is also important to leave some DCM in the MTBE to ensure product cleanup.  Dibenzofulvene, piperidine/fulvene adduct and residual piperidine are somble in MTBE.  The HAA27-36NH;; is collected and dried.  If necessary, a second trituration of the solid (12 hours) With MTBE Will remove residual dibenzofulvene and more importantly the piperidine/fulvene adduct that may be present in the HAA27-3 6NH2.  A trituration with hexane v:ill remove dibenzofulvene, but not the piperidine/fulvene adduct.  Drying time of the solid isolated from MTBE is 1 day.<br>
Due to the high sombility of HAA27-36NH2 and related impurities in DCM/MTBE, an analytical method was desired to accurately determine the end point of the solvent exchange. A GC method has been developed to assay DCM in MTBE.  The distillation is complete when the DCM content in the MTBE is below 6%.<br>

somtion is stirred at ambient temperature for 1.5 hours<br>
(note 1).  The organic somtion is washed with water (2x5<br>
vol).  The vomme of the organic layer is reduced to<br>
approximately one third the original vomme by distillation<br>
(approximately 25 mm Hg, jacket temperature less than 4 5 Â°C<br>
to avoid melting the solid).  MTBE (5 vol) is gradually<br><br>
introduced into the reaction vessel while concentration continues to a point of heavy precipitation and the pot vomme is approximately 5 vommes.  The solvent exchange is stopped when the DCM content is below 6%.  The smrry is cooled to 0-5 Â°C, stirred for 60 minutes then collected by vacuum filtration (rapid) .  The solids are Washed with MTBE (2 X 0.5 vol) and dried to constant Weight to give 1.022Kg of HAA27-36NH2 in 89.2% yield (2 steps) and 91.1A% purity (note<br>

FmocAA(27-36)"OH with HPheNH.	<br>
A new process that combines Sections 11.5 through 11.6.1, that takes FmocAA27-350H to HAA27-3 6NHndirectly has been developed.  This new process removes issues associated with isolating FmocAA27"3 6NK2 and a long drying time.  A detailed description is given below.  The new process removes a long drying time and a stage from the synthetic route.<br>
Add FmocAA27-350H (5.0g, I eq) , HOAT (0.459, 1.2 eq) and Phe-NHs (0.389, 1.2 eq) to a 100 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and nitrogen inlet.  Add 10 vommes of N14P (50 mL) and DIEA (0.45g, 1.5 eq) to the flask and stir under a nitrogen atmosphere until the solids dissolve.  Cool the somtion to 0 to 5 Â°C then add HBTU (l"<br><br>
.04g, 1.2 eq).  Stir under a nitrogen atmosphere at 0 to 5 "C for 3 0 minutes.  V7arin the reaction mixture to 20 0C and continue stirring.  Perform an in process check (IPC) 90 minutes after the HBTU was added (note 1) .<br>
After the in process check (IPC) shoWs the reaction is complete, add piperidine (1.379, 7 eq) to the reaction mixture and stir under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1.5 hours. Perform an IPC (note 1).  If the Fmoc removal is not complete, stir an additional 3 0 minutes and run the IPC.<br>
V7hen complete, add the reaction mixture to 5% aqueous acetic acid at a rate as to not exceed a temperature of 35 'C (30 vol).  Stir the resulting smrry for I to 2 hours and collect by vacuum filtration (note 2).  Wash the solid with 10 vommes (50 mL) of water.<br>
Return the damp solid to the reactor, add 2 0 vommes of water (100 mL) and stir at ambient temperature for 1 to 2 hours.  Collect the solids by vacuum filtration, Wash With 10 vommes of Water (50 mL) and dry (note 3).<br>
The dried (note 4) solid is triturated with MTBE (20 vol) at ambient temperature for 2 to 5 hours to remove dibenzofulvene and dibenzofulvene piperidine adduct.  Collect the solid by vacuum filtration and dry to constant weight yielding 4.55 grams (94.3%) of HAA2 7-3 6NH. with S5-90A% purity (note 1).<br>
Fmoc by products (dibenzofulvene and its piperidine adduct) are generally removed in this protocol, however, if a reWork is necessary, stir the solid in 10 vommes of MTBE at 2 0'C for 2 to 3 hours, collect and dry.<br>

11.7 Large Scale Preparation of Fragment FmocAA(17-<br>
36)-OH by Somtion Phase Synthesis fusion of<br>
FmocAA(17-26)-OH with HAA(27"36)-OH	<br>
A total of 5.115 Kg of FmocAA17-3 6NHn was prepared from 2,993 Kg of HAA27-3 6NH2and 3.176 Kg of FmocAA17-260H in four runs.  The average yield was 84.3%.  Filtering the crude solid after the Water dropout from the reaction mixture took an average of 4 0-50 minutes.<br>
A use test is run on a 1-2 g scale testing both fragments and the HBTU to be used prior to running the coupling reaction.  The stoichiometry of starting materials and reagents is determined from the use test.  The sombility of the starting materials is also noted in the use test.  A cloudy somtion may indicate the presence of salts in FmocAA17-260H and warrant a water wash on the fragment.  It is imperative that all components of the reaction mixture are clearly in somtion prior to addition of the HBTU to ensure complete conversion of the starting materials to product with minimal racemization and byproduct formation.<br>
The purity of crude FmocAA17-3 6NH2 isolated from the water dropout is significantly enhanced by precipitation from IPA.  FmocAA17-36NH2 is partially somble is IPA.  Trituration of FmocAA17-3 6NH2 with approximately 15 vommes of 95/5 IPA/water pre-warmed to 60-7 0 0c followed by stirring while cooling to room temperature over several hours enhances the purity of the fragment.  Both starting materials as Well as the piperidine amide of FmocAA17-260H and enamine urea adduct<br><br>
of HAA27-36NH2 are somble in the 95% IPA.  Trituration of the crude FmocAA17-3 6NK2 with 95% IPA at room temperature for extended periods of time is not as effective at removing impurities.  A stability study at 60-70 'C has been completed.  Faimre to warm the IPA somtion beyond 52 'C appears to have minimal impact on the quality of the product isolated.<br>

FmocAA(17-2 6)-OH with HAA(27-36)-OH	<br>
A 40L jacketed reactor fitted With a mechanical stirrer and nitrogen inlet is charged With FmocAA17-260H (1 eg., 0.770 Kg), KAA27-36NH2(1 eq. , 0.720 Kg), HOAT (1.5 eq.) and DMF (12.5 vommes relative to FmocAA17-2 60H) .  EtPr'N (1.5 eq.) is added and the suspension is stirred at room temperature until the solids are dissolved (visually).  The somtion is cooled to 0-5'C under an atmosphere of nitrogen and HBTU (1-1.05 eq) is added.  The reaction mixture is stirred at 0-5 'C until the HBTU dissolves (visually, about 15 minutes) .  The reaction mixture is Warmed to 25 0C and stirred for 2 hours (note 1).  The DMF somtion is cooled to 0-5 "C and cold process water (12,5 vol) is added at such a rate as to not exceed 25 0C.  The resulting smrry is stirred for 1-24 hours, the solids are collected by vacuum filtration and washed with water (3x4 vol) .  The solids are dried on the filter for 16-24 hours to approximately 2 times the theoretical mass. The 40 L reactor is charged with 9 5/5 isopropanol/water (25 vol) and warmed to 45'C.  The semi-dry FmocAA17-3 6NH. is added to the IPA somtion with rapid agitation.  The suspension is warmed to 52 Â°C, then stirred for 12-16 hours as it cools to room temperature (note 2). The solids are collected by vacuum filtration, Washed with a minimal amount of IPA and dried to give 1.261 Kg of FmocAA17-36NH2 in 85% yield and 90.SA% purity by HPLC (note 1),  The<br><br>

11.8 Large Scale Preparation of Fragment KAA(17-<br>
36)-OH from FmocAA(17-3 6)-OH	<br>
A total of 4.965 Kg of HAA17-3 6NH2was prepared from 5.112 Kg of FmocAA17-36NH2 in four runs.  Both the isolated yield and HPLC traces indicate the presence of dibenzofulvene and perhaps solvent.  The dibenzofulvene present will not interfere with the next coupling reaction as it was removed with potassium carbonate, not piperidine, therefore, the piperidine adduct of dibenzofulvene is not an issue chemically.<br>
There are several problems associated with this process. The reaction is run in 12 vommes of DMF.  The base removing the Fmoc group is I vomme of 1.1 M potassium carbonate, which is incapable of forming a difficult to remove, basic adduct with dibenzofulvene.  The deprotection proceeds in about 90 minutes at room temperature.<br><br>
A 1:1 saturated aqueous sodium chloridervater somtion, precooled to 0 Â°C is added to co-precipitate the fragment and dibenzofulvene.  This generates a fine, milky solid which takes hours (5-8) to filter.  Once isolated, the damp solid has to be dried completely (less than 1% LOD) to remove the dibenzofulvene impurity.  The drying takes 10 days (vacuum, no heat).  Once dry, the solid is returned to the reactor and triturated with 3:1 heptaneiMTBE (20 vol) at ambient temperature for 18 hours to remove the dibenzofulvene. Shorter trituration times do not remove it completely and if there is any water on the solids, it is not removed.  A 3:1 heptane:MTBE (20 vol) rework can be used if dibenzofulvene persists.<br>
To resolve these problems, the folloWing new procedure was developed.  Add FmocAA17-3 6NH2 (2.0 g, 1 eq.) and heptane (8 vol) to a 100 mL round bottom flask equipped With a mechanical stirrer, temperature controller and refmx condenser.  Add 2 vommes of MTBE (4 mL) and heat the smrry to 45-50Â°C (Note 1).  Add the piperidine (1 0 eq.).  Stir under a nitrogen atmosphere at 45-50'C for 24-36 hours (Note 2).  Hot filter the reaction mixture at 45-50'C (Note 3), then Wash the cake with 5 vommes (10 mL) of 60:40 heptane:MTBE.<br>
Notes:<br>
1.	Slower reaction will result if KTBE is allowed to escape the reactor thereby changing the heptane:MTBE ratio. Reaction temperatures greater than 50Â°C can result in gumming of the reaction solids.  The Fmoc is largely removed in 5 hours.<br>

A 4 0L jacketed reactor is charged with FmocAA17-3 6NH:: (1 eq, 1.2 6 Kg) and DMF (12 vol) at room temperature.  A 1.11 M aqueous potassium carbonate somtion (1 vol, 5 eq) is added at once (note l).  The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3.5 hours (note 2).  The reaction mixture is added slowly to a 1:1 somtion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride/water (10 vommes) pre-cooled to 0 Â°C at such a rate as to not exceed a temperature of 10 Â°C (approximately 1-2 hr).  The solid is collected by vacuum filtration using a rubber dam to compress water from the filter cake (note 3). The wet cake is transferred back to the reaction vessel and triturated (agitated) With water (10 vol) for 1-2 hours to remove residual inorganic salts.  The solid is collected by vacuum filtration, compressed with a rubber dam then transferred to a vacuum oven and dried to constant weight. The dry solid (note 4) is triturated (agitated) With 3:1 heptane:HTBZ (20 vol) for a minimum of 14 hours at room temperature to remove dibenzofulvene.  The solid is collected by vacuum filtration, washed With heptane (2 vol) and dried to give 1.20 Kg HAA17-36NH2 in 99.5% yield and 75A% purity. The HAA17-3 6NH2 contains 5A% dibenzofulvene.  Rework the reaction by repeating the heptane:MTBE trituration.<br>

11.9 Large Scale Preparation of Fragment AcAA(l-<br>
36)-OH by Somtion Phase Synthesis from<br>
AcAA(l-16)-0H and FmocAA(17-3 6)-OH	<br>
The ACAA1-160H was dissolved in DMF with HOAT and DIEA, cooled to 0Â°C and HBTU was added.  This was stirred for 15 minutes, or until the HBTU dissolved, then HAAI7-36NH3 was added.  Pre-activation of AcAAl-160H in the absence of HAA17-3 6NHo was a precaution that later was found not to be necessary.  In addition, dissomtion of HAA17-3 6NH2 into the O'C DMF somtion containing the activated AcAAl-160H proved to be slow on larger scale.<br>
A total of 6.972 Kg of ACAAI-36NH2 was prepared from 3.92 Kg of ACAA1-160H and 4.96 Kg of HAA17-36NH2 in four runs averaging 80.1% yield.  Two runs in this stage averaged 87% yield and two runs averaged 73% yield.<br>
A. use test is run on a 1-2 g scale testing both fragments and the HBTU to be used prior to running the coupling reaction.  The stoichiometry of starting materials and reagents is determined from the use test.  The sombility of the starting materials is also noted in the use test.  A cloudy somtion may indicate the presence of salts in AcAAl-160H and warrant a water wash on the fragment.  It is imperative that all components of the reaction mixture are clearly in somtion prior to addition of the HBTU to ensure complete conversion of the starting materials to product with minimal racemization and byproduct formation.<br>
The fragments, AcAAl-160H and HAA17-36NH2, and reagents HOAT and DIEA were dissolved in DMF, cooled to 0 Â°C and HBTU is added. One of the runs required an additional equivalent of DIEA to pick up the HCl on HAA17-3 6NH2.  The crude product<br><br>
is isolated from the reaction mixture With a water dropout (filtration time, 10 minutes) .  The still damp solid Was returned to a reactor containing acetonitrile pre-Warmed to 55 0C, then stirred rapidly while cooling to 35 Â°C over 3 hours, then to 20 "C  over night.  The smrry is cooled to 0-5 'C, stirred an additional 1-2 hours and the solid is collected by filtration.  During this process, the AcAAl-seNH. nearly goes into somtion at 55 Â°C.  As the somtion cools, the ACAAI-36NH2precipitates (oils) out of somtion.  As the somtion cools, the oil solidifies and eventually is transformed into a nice white solid.  During the course of this transformation, considerable deposition of solid on the reactor v:all and stir shaft may occur.  Most of this falls off as the smrry is stirred overnight at 20'C.  After collecting the solid, the reactor is filled with enough water to cover any solid sticking to the reactor walls or shaft. The smrry is stirred until all remaining solid has fallen off the walls and shaft (approximately 1 hour) , then used as a wash on the filter cake.  The acetonitrile wash removes unreacted starting materials and any truncated fragments less than 2 0 amino acids.<br>

A 40 liter reactor is charged with AcAAl-160H (938 g, 1<br>
eq) , KAAI7-36NH2 (1.19 Kg, 1 eq.), HOAT (1 eq), DMF (19 vol,<br>

stirred until the solids dissolve, then cooled to 0-5 0C  and<br>
HBTU (1.03 eq.) is added.  The somtion is stirred at 0-5 0C<br>

and stirred for 2 hours.  The reaction mixture is sampled for<br>
an IPC (note 1) .  When the reaction is judged complete, Water<br>
(19 vol) is added at such a rate as to not exceed 3 5 0C<br>

The smrry is stirred for 1-24 hours then the solid is collected by vacuum filtration (10 minutes) and Washed with water (2x3 vol.)-  The filter cake is compressed to remove as much Water as possible.  Meanwhile, the reactor is charged with 95% acetonitrile/water (30 vommes relative to the AcAAl-ieOH charge) and warmed to 55 0C with stirring.<br>
The damp solid is added to the reactor in portions to avoid cmmping.  The smrry is stirred while cooling to 3 5 Â°c over 3 hours, then to 2 0 Â°C overnight.  Cool to 0-5 Â°C, stir for 2 hours, stop stirring and sample the somtion.<br>
Collect the solid by vacuum filtration.  Wash the reactor and lines with 90% acetonitrile/water (3.6 vol).<br>
Charge the reactor with a sufficient amount of water to cover any solids sticking to the reactor v:alls or stir shaft (approximately 30 vol).  Stir at ambient temperature until the solids are no longer sticking to the reactor walls and shaft (approximately 1 hour).  Collect the solid with the rest and dry to constant weight (1.83 Kg, 86% yield).<br>

11.10    Deprotection of Side Chains of AcAA(l-<br>
36)-OH	<br>
It was the objective of this experiment to change the addition-rate of MTBE in the precipitation to keep the temperature less than 20'C  and also isolate and decarboxylate crude T-20 solid fi.e. remove somtion decarboxylation).<br>
The crude T20 was isolated by precipitation from ACN/water as a solid prior to loading onto an HPLC commn. The percent T2 0 content of the solid was determined by a weight based HPLC assay.<br>
After the side-chain protecting groups have been removed in the 90/5/5 TFA/water/dithiothreitol, the somtion is cooled to 0 Â°C and MTBE (45 vol. relative to AcAAl-SSNH' charge) is added.  This is a minimum amount of MTBE required to ensure complete precipitation of T-20.  There is an exotherm on mixing and the first 5 vommes must be added slowly to keep the temperature below 20 0C (approximately 60 minutes).  As more MTBE is added, the rate of addition can be increased.  Keeping the temperature below 20 Â°C during the precipitation prevents cmmping of the solid as it precipitates out of somtion.<br>
The current cleavage/purification protocol involves running the deprotection on scale that accommodates chromatographic purification.  The crude T-2 0 isolated from the deprotection cocktail as a TEA salt was dissolved in acetonitrile/water at pH 5, filtered and allowed to stand for 15 hours to effect decarboxylation of the tryptophan indoles. After the decarboxylation was complete, the somtion Was dimted and transferred to the purification suite to be loaded onto the commn.  During the dimtion, the somtion alWays became hazy and the turbid somtion was pumped onto the commn.  This resulted in deposition of solid onto the head of the commn and gradual erosion of commn performance during the purification runs.  Allowing T-2 0 to decarboxylate in acetonitrile/water at pH 5 for several hours leads to formation of highly insomble aggregates-<br><br>
A method to avoid decarboxylation in somtion has been developed- The crude T-20, isolated as a TFA salt from the MTBE precipitation, will decarboxylate under vacuum at room temperature over about 5-7 days. The decarboxylation Was found to be complete in three days at 4 0-C under vacuum. The TFA content of the solid isolated Was 9%. The material can be stored for up to one month at O'C with 1% wt/wt loss.<br>
A salt exchange in ethanol/water (1:9) with HOAc can be performed after isolating T-20-TFA from MTBE.  The acetate salt of crude T-20 is significantly more stable and may be preferred.  Either isolation method will allow the side-chain deprotection to be run on larger scale and the T-20 Will not be exposed to the acetonitrile/Water/HOAc conditions used for decarboxylation that are known to cause aggregation.<br>
New Method For Deprotection of Side Chains of AcAA(1-36)OH; Prepare a 90/5/5 TFA/water/dithiothreitol somtion (13 vol) and purge with nitrogen for 3 minutes.  ACAAI-36NH2 is added in portions to 90/5/5 TFA/water/dithiothreitol (13 vol) at ambient temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen.  Once in somtion, stir at ambient temperature for 4 hours then cool to 0 0C.  To precipitate the T-20, MTBE (45 vol), cooled to 0-5 Â°C, is added drop-Wise at a sloW rate initially maintaining a temperature below 20 'C (approximately 1-2 hour addition time).  The solid is collected by vacuum filtration (note 1).  The reactor, lines and filter cake are immediately washed with 3x5 vommes of MTBE.  The solid is removed, sampled for t = 0 IPC (note 2) and dried under vacuum for 5 days, or until HPLC shows no change.<br>
Notes:<br>
1.   Avoid pulling air through the solid during this<br>
filtration as the deprotection somtion is hygroscopic. Pulling air through solid before the TFA somtion has been washed out can result in a tacky or oily solid.<br><br>
2.        Use HPLC method TM2-O003-O1 (TFA method).  The aimonium acetate method (TM2-0006-01) does not separate the various carboxylated intermediates.<br>
Deprotection of Side Chains of AcAA(l-36)OH<br>
A total of 7.226 Kg of AcAAl-3 6NH. was deprotected in 12 runs.  Only 6.972Kg of AcAAl-3 6NH. was prepared suggesting that the intermediate may be hygroscopic.  The solid isolated from the MTBE dropout was dissolved in 10 vommes of 1:1 ACN/water, filtered and adjusted to pH 3.5 With sodium bicarbonate.  Acetic acid (1.5 vomme %) was added (pH 4.5 to 5) and the somtion was stirred at ambient temperature for 15 hours to effect decarboxylation.  The somtion was dimted with 2 5 vommes of water give a total of 4 0 vommes of an 85/15 Water/ACN somtion.  The somtion was turbid in all cases and in some, had a fine solid (aggregated T-20).  A sample was taken for IPC and the somtion was transferred to the purification suite.  Crude T-2 0 yields for the runs were calculated using a wt/v:t HPLC assay.<br>
The deprotection of ACAAI-36NH2 is complete in 90/5/5 TFA/water/DTT at room temperature after 4-5 hours.  At S hours, noticeable degradation (2%) has occurred.  In the same cocktail at 5"C, the deprotection is not complete at 8 hours, but is at 23 hours.  There is no difference in the purity of the crude T-2 0 obtained after 5 hours at room temperature versus 23 hours at S'C.  Because the isolation vomme (approximately 55 vol) is much larger then the reaction (deprotection) vomme (13 vol), it was necessary to dissolve the ACAAI-36NH2 in the TFA somtion in a 20L carboy, then transfer the somtion to a 40L reactor.<br>
Isolation of the crude, carboxylated T-20 (as a TFA salt) from the deprotection cocktail is accomplished by precipitation with MTBE.  The amount of MTBE needed to precipitate the peptide is 3-4 times the amount of deprotection cocktail.  Using MTBE at twice the vomme (or less) of the cleavage cocktail leaves peptide behind.<br><br>
Addition of the MTBE to the cleavage cocktail results in an easily filtered solid While adding the cocktail to MTBE produces a fine precipitate Which is difficult to filter. There is a temperature rise from 5"C to 40-45'0 during the addition of MTBE to the TFA somtion.  The temperature increase has no effect on the purity of the crude T-20 isolated (187/117,119).  There was some cmmping of the solids during the MTBE addition.  The smrry was stirred for 1-2 hours to break up the cmmps.  Maintaining a temperature below 20Â°C during the MTBE addition produces a more uniform solid that filters better (196/31).  The addition rate of the MTBE will be controlled in the future.  Crude T-20 was collected by filtration under a nitrogen atmosphere.  The solid will become tacky if exposed to moist air during the filtration before the TFA has been washed out.  After the TFA is Washed out, the solid is air stable.<br>
Method Run;<br>
A 90/5/5 TFA/water/dithiothreitol somtion (13 vol) is prepared in a 20 L carboy then purged With nitrogen for 3 minutes.  AcAAl-3 61TH' (650 g) is added in portions to prevent cmmping.  Once the solid is in somtion, the somtion is transferred to a 70L reactor.  The carboy and lines are washed With a minimal amount of 90/5/5/TFA/water/ dithiothreitol.  The somtion is stirred at ambient temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 4 hours, then cooled to 0-5 Â°C.  MTBE (45 vol) is added at a rate such that the internal temperature is less than 30 Â°C.  The solid is collected by vacuum filtration under a stream of nitrogen. The reactor, lines and solid are Washed with 2x2 vommes of MTBE and dried to constant weight (594 g, 7 0A%).<br>
The solid (594 g) is dissolved in 50% ACN/water (8 vommes relative to the AcAAl-seH, charge) and filtered.  The vessel and lines are washed with 50% ACN/water (2 vol).  The pH of the somtion is adjusted to 3.5-4.0 with sodium bicarbonate, then acetic acid (0.13 vol) is added bringing<br><br>
the pH to 4-9.  The somtion is stirred at amtJienr temperature for 15 hours (IPC, note 1), then the pH is adjusted to 9-9.5 with 1 M potassium carbonate.  The somtion is dimted to 85/15 Water/ACN by adding water (25 vol) .  The resulting turbid somtion is sampled for wt/wt KPLC analysis and transferred to the purification suite.<br>

11.11    Purification of HAA(l-36)-OH<br>
Purification, lyophilization and packaging are classified in three stages:<br>
%vt/wt = 100 - % impurities - % acetate - % water - % TFA.  The acetate content in the batches was 6-8%.<br>
A total of 2.08 Kg of T-20 (net) was isolated from 6.97 Kg of ACAA1-36NH2.  This represents a 49.3% yield from AcAAl-36NH2.  The average yield in the chromatographic purification of the was 55%.  The yields for individual runs varied from 41-55%.  The lowest yields were a result of commn or pump faimres leading to multiple passes.  In general, if the chromatography worked, the yields v:ere in the 5 0-55% range. The purity of the T-20 isolated was 93-95A%.<br>
Four gradients were examined during purification for a comparison of methods with the objective of minimizing the run time:<br>
1.	15-22% ACN/60 minutes, 22-36% ACN/525 minutes at 330 mL/min.<br>
2.	16-26% ACN/60 minutes, 26-40% ACN/525 minutes at 330 mL/min.<br>

4.	Original Trimeris gradient 20-23% ACN/1 12 minutes, 23-36% ACN/488 minutes at 330 mL/min.<br><br>
A twenty centimeter (cm) commn Was packed (axial compression) with the Amberchrom resin (35 cm bed height). Batches of 500-700g AcAAl-36NH2 were deprotected and decarboxylated in somtion.  This scale produces a commn feed stock that contains approximately 400 grams of peptide (approximately 75A% T-20).  The stock somtion is typically hazy and may contain suspended solid.  The turbid somtion is loaded onto the commn at 500 mL/min using 15% B.  There was no pressure build up during the commn load for any of the runs.  The floW rate is reduced to 3 30 mL/min and the specified gradient is run for the indicated amount of time. Fractions are collected and those containing over 78% T-20 are pooled (100-llOL), dimted with water to bring the acetonitrile content to approximately 15-20% (approximately 140 liters).  The commn is washed, then equilibrated with 15% B.  The T-20 containing somtion is loaded back onto the 8'inch commn at 900 mL/min.  The %B is increased to 50% and T-20 is fmshed of the commn in approximately 25L.<br>
The somtion is frozen in one liter bell jars and lyophilized to a powder.  The T20 isolated typically is 92-94A% by HPLC, and contains 6-8% acetate and 3-4% water.<br>
Preferred Method;<br>
A somtion of T-20 in 85/15 Water/acetonitrile (27L) at pH 9.2 was pumped onto an eight inch HPLC commn at 500 mL/min.  The Flow rate was reduced to 3 30 mL/min over 3 0 minutes (in increments of 3 0-4 0 mL/min every 5 minutes).  A linear gradient going from 20%B to 36%B over 600 minutes is initiated.  Fractions are collected until absorbance falls below 0,2 AUFS.  The fractions are analyzed by HPLC (note 1) for content.  The commn is Washed with 80%B at 900 mL/min for 10 minutes, then brought back to 15%B and equilibrated at 900 mL/min.  The fractions containing over 78A% T-20 are pooled (113 L) and dimted with buffer (28.2 L) to bring the acetonitrile concentration to 15-20%.  The somtion is pumped onto the commn at 900 mL/min.  The %B is increased to 50%<br><br>
and T-20 is elated off the commn at 900  mL/min in approximately 25L,  The concentration of T-20 is approximately 9-10 mg/mL.  The somtion is transferred to one liter lyophilization jars, frozen and freeze dried to give 216.29 of T-20 in 54.9% yield and 94.1A% purity.<br>

11.12     Thermal Stability of Peptides<br>
A series of experiments were conducted at to Characterize the thermal stability of the intermediate T-20 â–  fragments.  T-20 fragments were saturated with water, filtered and then placed in enclosed containers and exposed to elevated temperatures.  At several time points samples were collected and analyzed by HPLC methods to access the purity changes.  Stability of the dry T-20 fragments Was also characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)-<br>
All of the fragments can be dried at 4 0 'c for 3 days but AcAAl-ieOH.  Only modest degradation is observed after 2 4 hours at 80 Â°C in two fragments, FmocAA27-350H (3%) and FmocAA27-36NH2 (1.4%).  Fragment AcAAl-160H was initially 97A% pure.  After 3 days at 40 Â°C, it Was 93.4A% pure and dry. After an additional 24 hours at 80 Â°C it remained at 93.9A%. The damp AcAAl-160H should be dried at ambient temperature.<br>
The point of the stability study was to determine if the fragments can be dried at 4 0 Â°C rather then ambient temperature.  The study indicates that the fragments are stable to drying at 4 0 Â°C.  This will greatly reduce the drying times.<br><br>
A study designed to examine the stability of fragments Ac(1-16)-OH, Fmoc(27-35)-OH, Fmoc(17-26)-OH, Fmoc(27-3 6)-NH., Fmoc(17-3 6)-NH., K(17-36)-NH', and Ac(1-3 6)-NH. under various solvent and temperature conditions that mimic their isolation and purification has been completed.  All of the fragments are stable, stability is designated with an X, in the solvent systems from Which they are isolated and/or purified:<br><br><br>
