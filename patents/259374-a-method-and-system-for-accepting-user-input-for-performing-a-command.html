inventor: Sig G. Kupka<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
[0001 ]                 The present application is related to U.S. Utility Patent Application<br>
Serial No.	for "Manipulating An On-Screen Object Using Zones Surround<br>
ing The Object," filed on the same date as the present application. The disclosure of<br>
the related application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to user interfaces for manag-<br>
ing objects, and more particularly to a user interface that includes a common onscreen area, or zone, for both menu activation and stroke input.<br>
Description of the Background Art<br>
[0003]	Existing user interfaces provide many different techniques for mov-<br>
ing, altering, controlling, and otherwise manipulating on-screen objects such as windows, images, text blocks, video, and the like. For example, the Windows XP operating system, available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington, provides user interface elements for manipulating various types of on-screen objects. Examples of such user interface elements include:<br>
[0004]	- application menus (e.g., click on an object to select it, and select an<br>
operation from an application menu);<br>
[0005]	- on-screen buttons (e.g., click on an object to select it, and click a<br>
button to perform an operation on the object);<br>
[0006]	- context-sensitive menus (e.g., right-click on an object and select an<br>
operation from a pop-up menu);<br>
[0007]	- resize borders or handles (e.g., click-drag a window edge or object<br>
handle to resize the window or object); and<br>
[0008]	- keyboard commands (e.g., click on an object to select it (or use a<br>
keyboard to navigate to an on-screen object), and hit a keystroke to perform an operation on. the object).<br>
[0009]	In addition, some user interfaces (such as the Palm Operating Sys-<br>
tem, available from Palm, Inc.), can accept pen input, such as strokes or gestures, to be interpreted as data and/or commands.<br>
[0010]	Many elements of conventional user interfaces, including menus,<br>
buttons, icons, and pen input zones, operate by receiving user input at particular areas, or zones, of the screen. These types of user interface elements are presented at distinct locations on the screen that are often dedicated to a particular type of input. Thus, to activate a menu the user must click on a menu bar at a particular location on the screen; to activate a button command, the user must click on the button at another location; and to enter stroke or gesture input, the user must provide the input within a pen input zone.<br>
[0011 ]	Typically, each of these elements or zones occupies its own space on<br>
the screen. Such an approach consumes valuable screen real estate. Furthermore, such an approach can be confusing to users who must become familiar with each of the various input zones and how they are used. In addition, such an approach makes it difficult to establish a visual link between various ways to activate a particular command. For example, a print command can be activated from a menu, or button, or by inputting a stroke commandâ€”but there is no visual link between the disparate areas of the screen where each such command input means is located. Furthermore, existing techniques make it difficult to establish a relationship between a particular zone or zones and a particular onscreen object. Thus, an object that currently has focus for purposes of text input, button commands, or menu commands, is not visually linked to or proximate to the zones for these various types of input. The multiplicity of screen regions for activating menus, buttons, and stroke commands makes it difficult to connect, visually, a particular command input zone with the object to which the command will apply.<br>
[0012]	What is needed, therefore, is a user interface that includes a common<br>
zone, or region, for activating commands using two or more input methods or paradigms. What is needed, therefore, is a user interface that includes a common zone for activating a particular command via two or more input methods. What is further needed is a user interface that includes two or more zones, each zone for activating a particular type of command, each zone capable of accepting input via two or more methods for activating commands within the type. What is further needed is a user interface that reduces the amount of screen real estate needed for providing multiple mechanisms for activating commands, and that preserves the ability to relate command input regions to the objects on which the commands will operate. What is further needed is a user interface that accomplishes the above-stated goals in an easy-to-use, intuitive manner.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0013]	In one aspect of the present invention, a user interface includes at<br>
least one zone that is capable of accepting command input according to two or more<br>
input methods. For example, a user can click on the zone to activate a menu includ<br>
ing a number of commands, or the user can perform stroke input on the zone to di<br>
rectly activate a command associated with the stroke input. The user can perform ei<br>
ther action in the same zone, or area, of the screen. In one aspect, the directly activat-<br>
able commands also appear on the menu, so that the user can activate the same com<br>
mand via either method. Thus, the user can click within the zone to activate a com<br>
mand according to a menu, or can perform a stroke or gesture within the same zone<br>
to activate the same command directly, hi alternative embodiments, other actions<br>
than clicking, stroking, or gesturing can be used to activate commands. Also, other<br>
command input methods than menus or direct activation can be provided.<br>
[0014]	In another aspect, multiple command input regions are provided.<br>
Each may be associated with a different on-screen object, or with a particular command type. Thus, for example, a Format region might be provided, as well as a Create region. The user can activate commands of the first type (e.g., format commands),<br>
by clicking in the first zone to activate a format menu or by performing stroke input in the first zone to directly activate a command. Similarly/ the user can activate commands of the second type (e.g. create commands), by clicking in the second zone to activate a region menu or by performing stroke input in the second zone to directly activate a command.<br>
[0015]                Zones can be provided in consistent locations with respect to the ob<br>
jects to which they relate. As described in related U.S. Utility Patent Application Se<br>
rial No.	for "Manipulating An On-Screen Object Using Zones Surrounding<br>
The Object," a control region, including multiple zones, can surround each on-screen object in a consistent manner, so as to provide an easy-to-use mechanism for manipulating different types of objects.<br>
[0016]	The user specifies commands for manipulating the on-screen object<br>
by interacting with the zones. Commands can be activated in different ways, including menu selection, strokes, clicks, button presses, and the like, performed in the area defined by the corresponding zone.<br>
[0017]	The invention thus provides an easy-to-use mechanism for facilitat-<br>
ing multiple input methods, such as menu activation and stroke input, within a common zone or region. The techniques of the present invention preserve screen real estate, operate in an intuitive manner, and are flexible so that they can be applied in a variety of situations and user interfaces. They also make it easier for particular zones to be associated with particular command types and/or objects, so that the user need not learn multiple locations for different ways to activate commands for an object.<br>

Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0029]	The following description of system components and operation is<br>
merely exemplary of embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the various designs, implementations, and techniques described herein may be used alone or in any combination, and that many modifications and equivalent arrangements can be used. Accordingly, the following description is presented for purposes of illustration, and is not intended to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.<br>
[0030]	The invention may be implemented, for example, on a conventional<br>
personal computer running any known operating system, such as Microsoft Windows XP available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington. As described below, input to the system of the invention can be provided by any of a num-<br>
ber of types of devices, including for example: keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, touch-pad, trackball, tablet, microphone, remote control device, and/or the like. As will be seen from the following description, the present invention provides techniques for accepting user inputs from various types of input devices and according to various methods in a consistent and intuitive manner.<br>
[0031 ]	One skilled in the art will recognize that the user interface tech-<br>
niques of the present invention may be implemented on devices other than personal computers in which a display is provided to the user. For example, such techniques may be implemented on cell phones, consumer electronic devices, personal digital assistants, office appliances, wall-mounted controllers, automotive control systems, and the like. The description of the invention herein as it might be implemented on a personal computer is not intended to restrict the scope of the present invention or the range of devices on which it can operate.<br>
[0032]	Furthermore, for ilhistrative purposes the invention is set forth in<br>
terms of menu activation and stroke input in a common zone. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that the techniques of the invention can apply to other types of input elements activatable from a common zone. For example, the invention may apply to input elements that can be activated by gestures, strokes, clicks, doubleclicks, button presses, voice activation, and the like.<br>
User Interface Layout<br>
[0033]	Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown an example of a user inter-<br>
face 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. User interface 100 may be displayed, for example, on a display screen of a conventional personal computer. Object 102 is an example of an on-screen object displayed within user interface 100. In the example of Fig. 1, object 102 is a graphic object. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that object 102 can be a text object, or a representation of a video or audio object, or any other type of object that can be displayed or represented within the context of user interface 100.<br>
[0034]	As shown in Fig. 1, according to one embodiment object 102 is sur-<br>
rounded by various zones 103(A-K), referred to collectively as a control region. Each<br>
zone 103 provides a designated type of functionality for controlling one or more aspects of object 102, or otherwise manipulating object 102. Object 102, together with the  surrounding control region including zones 103, form a window within user interface 100.<br>
[0035]	The area of user interface 100 surrounding the window is referred to<br>
as a "panel" 104. Any number of windows can be presented within panel 104 simultaneously, and these windows can overlap one another, or they can be tiled, minimized, or otherwise manipulated according to known user interface techniques as modified and enhanced by the improvements of the present invention. In one embodiment, only one window is active at any given time, and this is the window for the object that has the focus or that is currently active. The user can cause a window (and its object 102) to be active according to well-known techniques such as: moving a cursor to a window and clicking a button; or using a series of keystrokes or voice commands to select and activate a particular window. In one embodiment, zones 103 are displayed only for the currently active window, and are omitted for all other windows. In another embodiment, zones 103 are displayed for all on-screen windows. In addition, in one embodiment panel 104 itself is treated like any other window, so that it can be activated and zones 103 relevant to the control and manipulation of panel 104 can be displayed. Also shown is cursor 110, which is controlled by the user via a mouse or other pointing device, and can be used to select and activate commands and menus as described below.<br>
[0036]	hi the example of Fig. 1, ten zones 103 A through 103K are shown,<br>
including zone 103J that overlays object 102, and zone 103K that is located outside control region 101. Zone 103K is depicted in the drawings as extending along the bottom of region 101, but in one embodiment includes all areas not within region 101. One skilled in the art will recognize that any number of zones could be included, and that the particular arrangement of zones 103 shown in Fig. 1 is merely exemplary, hi one embodiment, only one zone 103 operates as described herein. Referring momentarily to Fig. 1A, there is shown an example wherein only zone 103A is included. Referring momentarily to Fig. IB, there is shown an example wherein only zone 103J, representing the area overlaying object 102 itself, is included. Either of these exam-<br>
pies, or other arrangements including one or more zones 103, can be used. Thus, any subset of zones 103 shown in Fig. 1 can be omitted without departing from the essen-characteristics of the present invention. In addition, the invention may be implemented in a zone having no visible bounds, or having bounds that are coextensive with another on-screen element such as an object.<br>
Input Mechanisms<br>
[0037]	In operation, the device on which the user interface 100 operates de-<br>
tects user commands with respect to the various zones 103 of an onscreen object 102. For example, a user may use a mouse or other input device to move an onscreen cursor 110 to a zone 103. The user may then perform an action, such as clicking a button on a mouse, to activate a command or operation associated with the zone 103. As will be described in more detail below, some zones 103 may have different commands or operations associated with different user actions; for example, a user may click a left button to activate a first command, or a right button to activate a second command. Other possible actions associated with different types of commands include: "stroking" within a zone 103 by holding down a button and moving the cursor 110 a short distance in a particular direction; "shift-clicking" within a zone 103 by holding down a shift key (or other modifier key) while clicking within the zone 103; or double- or triple-clicking within a zone 103.<br>
[0038]	Thus, within a particular zone 103, a click might activate a menu, a<br>
shift-click might activate an alternate menu, and a stroke might activate a particular command. In one embodiment, the stroke command corresponds to one of the commands in the menu or alternate menu, thus providing the user with two (or more) ways to initiate the same command (i.e. via the menu or via a stroke).<br>
User Actions<br>
[0039]	Many different command sets are possible.  In one embodiment, the<br>
user can perform the following user input actions to activate commands:<br>
[0040]	- Click standard button (e.g. left-click) while cursor 110 is in zone<br>
103 (or, for pen input, touch zone 103 without pressing pen button): activates a pop-<br>
up menu, which may be also called a primary menu, containing commands for zone<br>
103. The displayed pop-up menu shows the relevant commands for the zone 103, and<br>
allows the user to navigate and select one of the displayed commands using known<br>
menu navigation techniques. In one embodiment, each pop-up menu for each zone<br>
103 is associated with a particular theme or general type of action, or group of associ<br>
ated actions. For example, a zone 103 may have a variety of commands or actions re<br>
lated to font characteristics; another zone 103 may have a variety of commands re<br>
lated to paragraph characteristics, and so forth. In one embodiment, included in the<br>
pop-up menu are commands that can be invoked by movement of the input device by<br>
a stroke in a predetermined direction (e.g., up, down, left, or right). Fig. 2 illustrates a<br>
pop-up menu 801 showing four stroke icons 802, each stroke direction corresponding<br>
to a particular command. Also included is a command that corresponds to a double<br>
click for zone 103. One skilled in the art will recognize that the menu can include<br>
commands for any other type of action or gesture that can be performed within zone<br>
103, and may also include commands that cannot be activated directly using an action<br>
or a gesture. Fig. 2 depicts an example of such a menu 801, including commands 803<br>
and icons 802 indicating corresponding stroke directions, and commands 803 having<br>
icons 802 indicating other actions such as a double-click and an Enter key.<br>
[0041 ]	- Click alternate button (e.g. right-click), or modified button (e.g.<br>
shift-click), or click and hold button while cursor 110 is in zone 103 (or, for pen input, either touch zone 103 with pen button pressed, or touch and hold the pen in zone 103): activates an alternate pop-up menu, which may also be called a secondary menu. The alternate pop-up menu operates in a similar manner as the first pop-up menu 801, and also includes icons or indicators showing direct actions that correspond to stroke directions, double-click, and the like, where applicable. In one embodiment, the on-screen cursor 110 changes to indicate that the button has been held long enough to activate the alternate menu.<br>
[0042]	- Stroke (i.e., hold down button and move cursor 110 a short dis-<br>
tance in a particular direction) starting in zone 103 (or, for pen input, stroke without pressing pen button): performs an action associated with the particular stroke direction. Strokes can be of any type, including straight lines, curves, or more complex<br>
shapes or gestures. In one embodiment, as described herein, strokes are associated with particular directions (up, down, left, or right), although one skilled in the art will other types of strokes may also be used. As described above, in one<br><br>
embodiment, the pop-up menu 801 for a zone 103 includes each of the stroke directions and indicates what command is associated with each stroke direction. Thus, the user can activate any of these actions by performing the stroke input or by clicking and then selecting the desired item from the pop-up menu 801. Longer strokes can be associated with a click-and-drag action.<br>
[0043]	- Double-click (or other action) in zone 103: performs an associated<br>
command. As described above, in one embodiment, the pop-up menu 801 for a zone 103 indicates what command is associated with double-clicking (or other actions). Thus, the user can activate the command by double-clicking or by clicking and then selecting the desired item from the pop-up menu 801.<br>
[0044]	.- Alternate stroke (i.e., hold down alternate button (right button), or<br>
modified button (shift-stroke), and move cursor 110 a short distance in a particular<br>
direction) starting in zone 103 (or, for pen input, stroke while pressing pen button, or<br>
hold pen in place for a moment and then stroke): performs an alternate command as<br>
sociated with the particular stroke direction (up, down, left, or right). As described<br>
above, in one embodiment, the alternate pop-up menu for a zone 103 includes each of<br>
the stroke directions and indicates what alternate action is associated with each stroke<br>
direction. In one embodiment, the on-screen cursor 110 changes when the modifier<br>
key is pressed, to remind the user that the alternate command will be performed.<br>
[0045]	- Alternate double-click (i.e., hold down alternate button (right but-<br>
ton), or modified button (shift-stroke), and double-click) in zone 103: performs an as<br>
sociated command. As described above, in one embodiment, the pop-up menu 801<br>
for a zone 103 indicates what command is associated with alternate double-clicking<br>
(or other actions). Thus, the user can activate the command by alternate double-<br>
clicking or by clicking and then selecting the desired item from the pop-up menu 801.<br>
[0046]	Alternate menus, stroke commands, double-clicks, and the like can<br>
be activated in a number of different ways, depending on the input device. For two-button devices, the alternate button can be used to activate the alternate commands.<br>
For one-button devices, the alternate mentis and strokes can be activated by pressing and holding the button down for a moment without movement. In one embodiment, The on-screen cursor 110 changes to indicate when the alternate action will be performed. A mechanism for keyboard activation of commands is described in more detail below.<br>
Examples of Command Structures<br>
[0047]	Referring now to Figs. 3A and 3B, there are shown examples of com-<br>
mand structures according to one embodiment, based on the zone layout shown in<br>
Fig. 1. Fig. 3 A depicts command types corresponding to primary menus, and Fig. 3B<br>
depicts command types corresponding to secondary, or alternate, menus.<br>
[0048]	In general, each zone 103 is associated with a number of actions that<br>
are related to a particular function or type, as set forth below. Although these actions are in general consistent among object types, some actions may be object-specific and/or inapplicable to certain types of objects.<br>
[0049]	In addition to the most commonly used actions that are generally<br>
accessible via a primary menu 801, each zone 103 is also associated with an alternate action or set of actions. For example, an alternate menu may be accessed by right-clicking or option-clicking a mouse, or by pressing a shift key prior to pressing a zone 103 activation key. Alternate keystrokes can be accessed by stroking while holding down a right mouse button, or a modifier key such as shift or option. Other techniques may also be used for accessing alternate actions.<br>
[0050]	Wherever possible, each zone provides unified, consistent access to a<br>
group of commands that related to a particular theme. The input actions of clicking, click-and-hold, or stroking provide various ways to access commands within the group. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the user can activate a command by selecting the command from a menu associated with a particular zone 103, and he or she can directly activate the same command directly from the same zone 103 by performing a stroke or other gesture within the zone 103.<br>
[0051]	Referring now to Figs. 4A through 4E, there is shown an example of<br>
activation of a command via these two methods. Fig. 4A depicts a particular type of object (an input field 700 for controlling a time), as may be included for example in a calendaring program for maintaining information about appointments and reminders. For illustrative purposes, input field 700 includes two input zones (start zone 103A and end zone 103H), although fewer or more zones 103 could be provided. Input field 700 is an object that has two primary purposes: 1) to display a representation of a time period; and 2) to accept user input for changing the time period and/or the manner in which it is displayed.<br>
[0052]	Fig. 4A depicts input field 700 having a value of 9:00 - 9:45 am. In-<br>
put field 700 includes start zone 103A for changing the start time of the appointment, and end zone 103H for changing the end time. Zones 103A and 103H may be displayed with an outline, text label, distinct color, icon, or other indicator or any combination thereof. Alternatively, zones 103A and 103H may contain no visible demarcations.<br>
[0053]	In one embodiment, zone 103A allows the user to change the start of<br>
the time period, and zone 103H allows the user to change the end time. Changes can be made by stroking within the zone 103A or 103H, or by selecting a menu for zone 103A or 103H and selecting the desired command from the menu. According to the techniques of the present invention, the same zone 103A or 103H is used for both types of input method.<br>
[0054]	When using direct stroke input, stroking in different directions<br>
causes different commands to be initiated. For example, for zone 103A, vertical strokes would cause coarse adjustments to the start point to be made (e.g., changing by 15 minutes), while horizontal strokes would cause fine adjustments to be made (e.g., changing by one minute). Alternatively, vertical strokes might change the value by a one-hour increment (or some other relatively coarse increment), while horizontal strokes might change the value by a one-minute increment (or some other relatively fine increment). In general, strokes in the up and left directions move the start point earlier, while strokes in the down and right directions move the start point later. The particular increments and directions of movement can be preset, or can be user-<br>
configurable via a preferences or options screen. Similarly, for zone 103H, vertical strokes indicate coarse changes to the end time, while horizontal strokes indicate fine changes.<br>
[0055]	In one embodiment, the time period adjustment is repeated if the<br>
user holds the stylus or other pointing device in position at the end of the stroke; in another embodiment, the time period adjustment is repeated if the user continues to stroke in the same direction (if desired, a wait period can be implemented before the repetition commences, as is conventionally done in auto-repeat modes for keyboards). The time period adjustment repetition can be set to accelerate if the user continues to hold for a predetermined period of time, hi one embodiment, the user can "back up" if the time period adjustment goes to far. The display of input field 700 is continually adjusted so that the user can see the time period adjustments in real-time and release or backtrack at precisely the correct moment.<br>
[0056]	Referring now to Figs. 4B and 4C, there is shown an example of<br>
changing the end time of the time period via direct stroke input.   In Fig. 4B, the user performs a horizontal stroke 401 within zone 103H, indicating that he or she wishes to perform fine adjustment to the time period. Stroke 401 is shown in Fig. 4B for illustrative purposes to represent the user's action. The arrow representing stroke 401 may be momentarily displayed to provide visual feedback of the user input, or it can be omitted. Other forms of feedback may be provided, such as visual or auditory indication that a command has been received.<br>
[0057]	Fig. 4C depicts input field 700 after time period has been adjusted in<br>
response to the user's command. The user indicated a fine adjustment of the end time; accordingly, the end time of the appointment has been adjusted from 9:45 to 9:46.<br>
[0058]	Referring now to Figs. 4D and 4E, there is shown an example of<br>
changing the end time of the time period using a menu command.   In Fig. 4D, the user clicks within zone 103H to activate menu 801. Menu 801 includes commands 802 for changing the end time by coarse and fine increments. Commands 802 correspond to stroke commands available within zone 103H, such as up, down, left, and right.<br>
Menu 801 may also include additional commands that do not correspond to stroke commands.<br>
[0059]	The user selects a command 802. Menu 801 is dismissed, and the<br>
command is executed. In Fig. 4E, input field 700 is shown after the user has selected<br>
the command 802 for changing the end time by a fine increment (one minute). Ac<br>
cordingly, the end time of the appointment has been adjusted from 9:45 to 9:46.<br>
[0060]	Figs. 4D and 4E thus depict an example of executing a time adjust-<br>
ment command that has the same effect as the direct stroke command of Figs. 4B and<br>
4C. According to the techniques of the invention, both the direct stroke method and<br>
the menu method are associated with a particular input zone 103H. In this case, the<br>
particular input zone 103H is dedicated to adjusting the end. time of input field 700.<br>
[0061]	Referring now to Fig. 5, there is shown a screen shot depicting an<br>
example of a menu 801 for an input field 700. Menu 801 is activated by clicking on the lower right zone 103H of control region 101. Input field 700 contains the value "05:30p - 05:45p." Menu 801 includes commands 803 for changing the end time by various increments. Icons 802 indicate stroke directions corresponding to commands 803. In the example, horizontal strokes are used for coarse adjustments (by quarter-hour increments), and vertical strokes are used for fine adjustments (by one-minute increments).<br>
[0062]	Referring now to Fig. 6A, there is shown an example of a control re-<br>
gion 101 for a text object 102. Text object 102 is a word within a sentence. Control re<br>
gion 101 includes zones 103A through 103J as described above.<br>
[0063]	Referring now to Fig. 6B, there is shown an example of a control re-<br>
gion 101 for a text object 102, wherein menu 801 has been activated. Menu 801 includes commands 803 and icons 802 indicating corresponding stroke directions.<br>
