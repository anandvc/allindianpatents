FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and transmission apparatus for transmitting<br>
broadcast system information in a mobile communication system. Further, the invention<br>
relates to a method and mobile terminal receiving the broadcast system information.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is a radio interface for IMT-2000<br>
system (International Mobile Telecommunication system), which was standardized for<br>
use as the 3rd generation wireless mobile telecommunication system. It provides a variety<br>
of services such as voice services and multimedia mobile communication services in a<br>
flexible and efficient way. The standardization bodies in Japan, Europe, USA, and other<br>
countries have jointly organized a project called the 3rd Generation Partnership Project<br>
(3GPP) to produce common radio interface specifications for W-CDMA.<br>
The standardized European version of IMT-2000 is commonly called UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunication System). The first release of the specification of UMTS has<br>
been published in 1999 (Release 99). In the mean time several improvements to the<br>
standard have been standardized by the 3GPP in Release 4, Release 5 and Release 6.<br>
A discussion on further improvements is ongoing under the scope of Release 7 and<br>
Study Item on Evolved UTRA and UTRAN.<br>
UMTS Architecture<br>
The high level Release 99/4/5 architecture of Universal Mobile Telecommunication<br>
System (UMTS) is shown in Fig. 1 (see 3GPP TR 25.401: "UTRAN Overall Description",<br>
incorporated herein by reference, available from http://www.3gpp.org). The UMTS<br>
system consists of a number of network elements each having a defined function.<br>
Though the network elements are defined by their respective function, a similar physical<br>
implementation of the network elements is common but not mandatory.<br><br>
The network elements are functionally grouped into the Core Network (CN) 101, the<br>
UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) 102 and the User Equipment (UE)<br>
103. The UTRAN 102 is responsible for handling all radio-related functionality, while the<br>
CN 101 is responsible for routing calls and data connections to external networks. The<br>
interconnections of these network elements are defined by open interfaces (lu, Uu). It<br>
should be noted that UMTS system is modular and it is therefore possible to have<br>
several network elements of the same type.<br>
In the sequel two different architectures will be discussed. They are defined with respect<br>
to logical distribution of functions across network elements. In actual network<br>
deployment, each architecture may have different physical realizations meaning that two<br>
or more network elements may be combined into a single physical node.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the current architecture of UTRAN. A number of Radio Network<br>
Controllers (RNCs) 201, 202 are connected to the CN 101. Functionally, the RNC 201,<br>
202 owns and controls the radio resources in its domain and typically terminates the<br>
Radio Resource Control protocol on the access network side. Each RNC 201, 202<br>
controls one or several base stations (Node Bs) 203, 204, 205, 206, which in turn<br>
communicate with the user equipments. An RNC controlling several base stations is<br>
called Controlling RNC (C-RNC) for these base stations. A set of controlled base stations<br>
accompanied by their C-RNC is referred to as Radio Network Subsystem (RNS) 207,<br>
208. For each connection between User Equipment and the UTRAN, One RNS is the<br>
Serving RNS (S-RNS). It maintains the so-called lu connection with the Core Network<br>
(CN) 101. When required, the Drift RNS 302 (D-RNS) 302 supports the Serving RNS (S-<br>
RNS) 301 by providing radio resources as shown in Fig. 3. Respective RNCs are called<br>
Serving RNC (S-RNC) and Drift RNC (D-RNC). It is also possible and often the case that<br>
C-RNC and D-RNC are identical and therefore abbreviations S-RNC or RNC are used.<br>
Commonly, a Drift RNS 302 is used for soft handovers of UEs between different RNS.<br>
General Description of the Protocol Model of the UTRAN Terrestrial Interfaces<br>
Fig. 4 shows an overview of the protocol model of the UTRAN in an UMTS network. For<br>
a better understanding, only a brief description is provided herein; further details may be<br>
found in Holma et al., "WCDMA for UMTS", Third Edition, Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., October<br>
2004, Chapter 5, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
On the horizontal plane, the protocol model can be split into the radio network layer and<br>
the transport network layer. All UTRAN-related issues are visible and handled on the<br><br>
radio network layer, while transport network layer typically represents standard transport<br>
technology that is selected to be used for data transport for the UTRAN without any<br>
UTRAN-specific changes.<br>
On the vertical plane, the protocol model can be split into control plane and user plane.<br>
The control plane is used for UMTS-specific control signaling (i.e. signaling related to<br>
radio and transport interfaces) and includes the Application Protocol (AP), e.g. RANAP<br>
on the lu interfaces, RNSAP on the lur interfaces, NBAP on the lub and RRC on Uu<br>
interfaces. The control plane functions and Application Protocol allows setting up traffic<br>
radio bearers to the UEs via so-called signaling radio bearers.<br>
While the control plane protocols are responsible for the UMTS-specific control signaling,<br>
the user plane transports the data streams sent by and sent to the users, such as voice<br>
calls, streaming data, packets of packet-switched services, etc. For transport, the user<br>
plane contains the so-called traffic radio bearers (also sometimes referred to as Data<br>
Bearers).<br>
The transport network control plane is used for control signaling within the transport<br>
network layer and does not include any radio network layer related information. The<br>
transport network control plane includes the ALCAP protocol, which is used to set up the<br>
traffic bearers for exchanging user plane information and the signaling bearers required<br>
for communicating ALCAP protocol messages. Due to the presence of the transport<br>
network control plane, it is possible that the Application Protocol within the control plane<br>
may operate completely independent from the technology selected for data transport on<br>
the traffic radio bearers in the user plane. The transport network control plane controls<br>
the operation of the transport network user plane.<br>
UTRA Radio Interface Protocol architecture<br>
An overview of the radio interface protocol architecture of the UTRAN is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Generally, the radio interface protocol architecture of the UTRAN implements Layers 1 to<br>
3 of the OSI protocol stack. The protocols terminated in the UTRAN are also referred to<br>
as the access stratum (protocols). In contrast to the access stratum, all protocols not<br>
terminated in the UTRAN are typically also referred to as the non-access stratum<br>
protocols.<br>
As has been discussed with respect to Fig. 4, the vertical split of the protocols into user<br>
plane and control plane is illustrated. The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol is a<br><br>
Layer 3 protocol of the control plane which controls the protocols in the lower layers of<br>
the UTRA Radio Interface (Uu).<br>
The RRC protocol is typically terminated in the RNC of the UTRAN, however other<br>
network elements have also been considered for terminating the RRC protocol in the<br>
UTRAN, e.g. the Node Bs. The RRC protocol is used for signaling of control information<br>
to control access to radio resources of the radio interface to the UEs. Further, there is<br>
also the possibility that the RRC protocol encapsulates and transports non-access<br>
stratum messages, which are usually related to control within the non-access stratum.<br>
In the control plane, the RRC protocol relays the control information to Layer 2, i.e. the<br>
Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol, via signaling radio bearers through Service Access<br>
Points (SAPs). In the user plane the non-access stratum protocol entities may use traffic<br>
radio bearers to directly access Layer 2 via SAPs. The access may be made to the RLC<br>
directly or to the Packed Data Convergence Protocol which in turn provides its PDUs to<br>
the RLC protocol entity.<br>
The RLC offers the SAPs to the higher layers. The RRC configuration defines how RLC<br>
will handle the packets, e.g. whether RLC is operating in transparent, acknowledged or<br>
unacknowledged mode. The service provided to the higher layers in the control plane<br>
and user plane by the RRC or PDCP are also referred to as signaling radio bearer and<br>
traffic radio bearer, respectively.<br>
The MAC/RLC layer in turn offers its services to the RLC layer by means of so-called<br>
logical channels. The logical channels essentially define what kind of data is transported.<br>
The physical layer offers its services to the MAC/RLC layer, the so-called transport<br>
channels. The transport channels define how and with which characteristics the data<br>
received from the MAC layer are transmitted via the physical channels.<br>
Logical and Transport Channels in UTRAN<br>
In this section the mapping between logical channels and transport channels will be<br>
outlined referring for exemplary purposes to the UMTS architecture. The mapping of<br>
logical channels to transport channels may be utilized for some of the signaling<br>
messages within a RRC connection establishment procedure.<br>
The characteristics and mapping of logical and transport channels for UTRA and E-<br>
UTRA are summarized in the following tables. Logical channels are mainly described by<br><br>
data type to be transmitted whereas transport channels are mainly described by<br>
respective transmission types and identification method.<br>
The table below contains a description of logical and transport channels for UTRA and E-<br>
UTRA, respectively.<br><br><br><br>
Please note that mapping of DCCH in the table above may be possible on a Fractional<br>
Dedicated Channel in downlink direction for UMTS Release 6 and on Enhanced<br>
Dedicated Transport Channel in uplink for UMTS Release 6 of the Evolved UTRA. These<br>
options have however not been considered in the table for the sake of simplicity.<br>
For UTRA, identification of transport channels as shown in the table above is Layer 2<br>
inband. Layer 2 inband identification means that header of a Layer 2 MAC PDU contains<br>
UE identifier pointing at a specific UE as a destination or source of information for<br>
downlink or uplink direction, respectively. Consequently, for mapping of logical channels<br>
containing data of system information and common service control type identification is<br>
not needed. Identification is applicable only to common transport channels (RACH and<br>
FACH) apart from broadcast common transport channel (BCH).<br>
The following table shows an exemplary description of logical channels and transport<br>
channels in the Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA).<br><br><br><br><br>
It can be noted that legacy FACH is not used and that shared channels are used instead<br>
of legacy DCH. It is assumed that associated physical channels in downlink direction are<br>
used for both SDCH and SUCH. An example of associated physical channel could be<br>
Shared Control Signaling CHannel (SCSCH).<br>
The transmission types description in the respective column of the table above should be<br>
understood as follows. A static configuration means that the transport format attributes of<br>
the channel, e.g. modulation, forward error correction scheme etc. are system-specific<br>
and are not subject to change by the network. In a semi-static configuration the transport<br>
format attributes of the channel, e.g. modulation, forward error correction scheme etc.<br>
are subject to change by reconfiguration procedure. The procedure is fairly slow<br>
introducing latency of the order of 100 ms. Finally, in a dynamic configuration the<br>
transport format attributes of the channel, e.g. modulation, forward error correction<br>
scheme etc. are subject to change by signaling on associated control channels. The<br>
procedure is fairly fast relative to semi-static reconfiguration and may introduce a delay<br>
of the order of several sub-frames (1 sub-frame ~ 0.5 ms). Dynamic configuration may<br>
be carried out so as to optimally match transmission format to temporal variations of<br>
radio channel in which case it may be referred to as link adaptation.<br>
Information that may be transmitted by this channel is given in the table below:<br><br>
It can be seen from the table that UE identification information is contained in both<br>
downlink and uplink directions. Thus, by virtue of Layer 1 outband identification, having<br>
decoded the data on the SCSCH and having determined that the identifier transmitted on<br>
the associated physical channel corresponds to the identifier assigned to the UE during<br>
the RRC connection establishment procedure, the UE can receive physical channels on<br>
which respective shared transport channels are mapped and further process Layer 2<br>
PDUs (Protocol Data Units) corresponding to SDCH and SUCH shared transport<br><br>
channels. Identification for CACH transport channel is analogous to the identification for<br>
RACH transport channel in E-UTRA. It can be concluded that identification is applicable<br>
to common and shared transport channels (CACH, SDCH and SUCH) apart from<br>
evolved broadcast common transport channel (Evolved-BCH). Identification for said<br>
i common transport channels is of L2 inband type, while the identification for shared<br>
transport channels is of Layer 1 outband type.<br>
From the definitions of "Layer 2 inband" and "Layer 1 outband" identification one could<br>
infer that there is one and only one identifier per UE. Hence, once a Signaling Radio<br>
Bearer has been established, the UE has been assigned identifier that can be used for<br>
Traffic Radio Bearer as well. However, it is possible that multiple identifiers per UE are<br>
defined and used per configured transport channel.<br>
Spectrum allocation<br>
With respect to stand-alone operation of the mobile terminals spectrum allocations of<br>
different sizes (e.g. 1.25 MHz, 2.50 MHz, 5.00 MHz, 10.00 MHz, 15.00 MHz and 20.00<br>
MHz) have been suggested in 3GPP TR 25.912, " Requirements for Evolved UTRA (E-<br>
UTRA) and Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN)", version 7.1.0 (available at<br>
http://www.3gpp.org) . It can be shown that data rate of evolved Primary Common<br>
Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH - in legacy system, the BCH transport channel is<br>
mapped to the P-CCPCH) varies depending on size of spectrum allocation (as indicated<br>
in the table below), assuming that configuration of Evolved Broadcast Transport Channel<br>
is semi-static.<br><br>
It can concluded that the UE reading time for reading a predetermined amount of data<br>
from the physical channels depends upon spectrum allocation. Therefore, for smaller<br>
spectrum allocations, the UE reading time and thereby power consumption is increased.<br>
Furthermore, when the data size implies the transmission of the data over several<br>
transmission time intervals (TTIs), the UE has to power its receiver to receive data at all<br>
TTIs in which the data is provided. For larger spectrum allocations, the UE reading time<br>
is decreased, but if several data portions are sent in one TTI, UE may need to decode<br>
irrelevant portions in that TTI, since the receivers may typically only be tuned to receive<br><br>
data of a complete TTI. This may also lead to unnecessarily increased UE power<br>
consumption.<br>
The potential shortcomings outlined above are illustrated in Fig. 8 and 9 for the<br>
transmission of broadcast system information (BSI), which is typically partitioned into<br>
system information blocks (SIBs) in UMTS (Fig. 7). From Fig. 8, it can be recognized that<br>
for a spectrum allocation size of 5.00 MHz, the UE has to receive contents of the<br>
broadcast control channel BCCH over two successive TTIs to acquire information<br>
contained in SIB8, even though possibly MIB (at a given time instant) and SIB7/9/10 may<br>
not be of interest for the UE. Also, for larger spectrum allocations, e.g. of the size 10.00<br>
MHz, as shown in Fig. 4, the UE decodes the master information block MIB and SIB1. In<br>
addition, the UE also decodes SIB2 and SIB3 even though the contents of these<br>
information blocks may not be necessary for system access or elementary mobility<br>
functions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to suggest an improved method for broadcasting broadcast<br>
system information.<br>
The object is solved by the subject matter of the independent claims. Advantageous<br>
embodiments of the invention are subject matters to the dependent claims.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, different partitions of broadcast system<br>
information are mapped to a shared transport channel or a broadcast transport channel<br>
for transmission. According to an embodiment of the invention, the mapping may take<br>
into account parameters inherent to the mobile terminals to which the broadcast system<br>
information is to be transmitted and/or parameters inherent to the different partitions of<br>
broadcast system information.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a method for transmitting broadcast system<br>
information in a radio access network of a mobile communication system is provided.<br>
According to the method, system information blocks of a broadcast control logical<br>
channel is mapped to a shared transport channel or a broadcast transport channel<br>
depending on a property of a respective system information block or the mobile terminals<br>
to receive the broadcast system information, and the system information blocks are<br>
transmitted via the shared transport channel and the broadcast transport channel,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
For example, the intrinsic property of a system information block may be at least one of<br>
the temporal variability of the information contained in the system information block, the<br>
size of the system information block, the necessity of the information comprised in the<br>
system information block for system access, and the necessity of the information<br>
comprised in the system information block for tracking user location within the mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
Examples for an intrinsic property of the mobile terminals may be a capability to support<br>
an optional feature within the mobile communication system.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a master information block of a broadcast<br>
control logical channel is transmitted periodically via the broadcast transport channel.<br>
The master information block may comprise control information associated to a<br>
respective one of the system information blocks. The associated control information may<br>
indicate whether a respective system information block is mapped to the broadcast<br>
transport channel or the shared transport channel.<br>
In case a system information block is mapped to the shared transport channel, in a<br>
variation of the embodiment, the associated control information comprises transmission<br>
format and timing of a respective system information block transmitted via the shared<br>
transport channel.<br>
In a further variation, the associated control information specifies at least the position of<br>
the respective system information block on the broadcast transport channel, the time<br>
interval at which the respective system information block is transmitted and a timer<br>
value- or value tag-based update mechanism to be utilized to update the information of<br>
the respective system information block.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the control information is transmitted on a<br>
control channel associated to the shared data channel. The control information may<br>
indicate to the transmission format and timing of a respective system information block<br>
transmitted via the shared transport channel.<br>
In a variation of the embodiment, the control information further comprises identification<br>
of the logical channel-to-transport channel mapping.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention part of control information is transmitted in the<br>
headers of shared transport channel packets and comprises an identification of the<br>
logical channel to transport channel mapping.<br><br>
In both embodiments above, the identification of the logical channel-to-transport channel<br>
mapping may be made by including a plurality of configured or default identifiers to the<br>
control information as transmitted on master information block.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the system broadcast information comprises<br>
information on the configuration of at least one shared transport channel of a neighboring<br>
radio ceil.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to the reception of broadcast system<br>
information in a radio access network of a mobile communication system by a mobile<br>
terminal. The mobile terminal may receive a master information block of a broadcast<br>
control logical channel via a broadcast transport channel. The master information block<br>
may comprise control information associated to a respective one of a plurality of system<br>
information blocks used to convey the broadcast system information. Further, the<br>
associated control information may indicate to the mobile terminal whether a respective<br>
system information block of a plurality of system information blocks conveying the<br>
broadcast system information is mapped to the broadcast transport channel or a shared<br>
transport channel. The mobile terminal may receive system information blocks of a<br>
broadcast control logical channel on a shared transport channel or a broadcast transport<br>
channel according to the indication in the master information block.<br>
In case a system information block is to be received via the shared transport channel, a<br>
variation of the embodiment foresees comprising a configuration of the shared transport<br>
channel to which the system information block is mapped, further associated control<br>
information in the master information block, and identifying the shared transport channel<br>
on which the system information block is mapped among a plurality of shared transport<br>
channels based on the indication in the associated control information of the master<br>
information block to receive the system information block via the identified shared<br>
channel and transmitted configured or default identifier. The configuration may for<br>
example be a set of transmission format parameters. The indication of the mapping of<br>
individual SIBs to the shared transport channel may for example be made by using<br>
configured or default identifiers, each identifying an associated transport channel in the<br>
system.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the mobile terminal may receive control<br>
information on a physical control channel associated to the shared data channel. The<br>
associated control information may indicate the transmission format and timing of a<br><br>
respective system information block transmitted via the shared transport channel. The<br>
mobile terminal may utilize the indicated transmission format and timing for receiving the<br>
respective system information block via the shared transport channel.<br>
Further, in an embodiment of the invention, the system broadcast information received<br>
by the mobile terminal may also comprise information on the configuration of at least one<br>
shared transport channel of a neighboring radio cell and the mobile terminal may use the<br>
information on the configuration of at least one shared transport channel of a neighboring<br>
radio cell for receiving broadcast system information in the neighboring radio cell, in case<br>
the mobile terminal is handed over to the neighboring radio cell.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides a transmission apparatus in a radio<br>
access network for transmitting broadcast system information in the radio access<br>
network of a mobile communication system. The transmission apparatus may comprise a<br>
processor to map system information blocks of a broadcast control logical channel to a<br>
shared transport channel and a broadcast transport channel depending on a property of<br>
a respective system information block or the mobile terminals to receive the broadcast<br>
system information. Further, it may comprise a transmitter to transmit the system<br>
information blocks via the shared transport channel and the broadcast transport channel,<br>
respectively.<br>
In a variation of the embodiment, the transmission apparatus is configured to perform the<br>
steps of the method for transmitting broadcast system information according to one of<br>
the various embodiments and variations described herein.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention relates to a mobile terminal for receiving broadcast<br>
system information in a radio access network of a mobile communication system.<br>
According to this exemplary embodiment the mobile terminal comprises a receiver for<br>
receiving a master information block of a broadcast control logical channel via a<br>
broadcast transport channel. Moreover, the mobile terminal may be configured with a<br>
processor for obtaining control information from the master information block. This<br>
control information is associated to a respective one of a plurality of system information<br>
blocks used to convey the broadcast system information and may indicate whether a<br>
respective system information block is mapped to the broadcast transport channel or a<br>
shared transport channel. The receiver may further receive system information blocks of<br>

criteria that may be used as a basis for the mapping decision may be intrinsic property of<br>
a system information block or an intrinsic property of the mobile terminals to which the<br>
system information is to be broadcast.<br>
Examples for an intrinsic property of a system information block may be temporal<br>
variability of the information contained in the system information block or the size of the<br>
system information block. Another intrinsic property of a system information block is for<br>
example the necessity of the information comprised in the system information block for<br>
system access or the necessity of the information comprised in the system information<br>
block for tracking user location within the mobile communication system.<br>
An intrinsic property of the mobile terminals may for example be the capability of<br>
terminals to support feature(s) defined optional within the mobile communication system.<br>
The mapping of system information blocks to a shared or broadcast transport channel<br>
can be advantageous in that the acquisition of this information by mobile terminals in<br>
terms of terminal processing time and power consumption may be optimized. Other<br>
advantages that may be achieved when applying the invention may be improved reading<br>
time for broadcast system information of mobile terminals for all sizes of standalone<br>
spectrum allocations, greater flexibility of operators in configuring transport channels for<br>
broadcast and increased scheduling efficiency of system information, which may be a<br>
result from mapping system information to a shared transport channel.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the behavior of the mobile terminals to receive the<br>
broadcast system information. According to another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
mobile terminals will receive a master information block on the broadcast transport<br>
channel, which indicates the mapping of individual SIBs to either the broadcast transport<br>
channel or the shared transport channel. Based on the indication of the mapping used,<br>
the mobile terminals will receive the SIBs either on the broadcast control channel or the<br>
shared control channel. In another embodiment of the invention, Layer 1 outband or<br>
Layer 2 inband identification is used for providing the mobile terminals with control<br>
information necessary to appropriately receive the SIBs, as will be outlined in more detail<br>
below.<br>
In the following the structure of system broadcast information and their allocation to<br>
different System Information Blocks (SIBs) according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention is outlined considering a UMTS system. The structure of the information<br>
transmitted on the broadcast control channel - a logical channel - may be tree-like. A so-<br><br>
called Master Information Block (MIB) forms the root of the tree structure, whereas the<br>
so-called System Information Blocks (SIBs) represent its branches. The MIB information<br>
may be transmitted less frequently than the SIBs carrying the broadcast system<br>
information. The information in the MIB may also not need to be read by the individual<br>
terminals each time the MIB information is transmitted.<br>
The structure of the information on the BCCH is shown for exemplary purpose in Fig. 6.<br>
One part of MIB may for example be reserved for information upon each System<br>
Information Block. The control information associated to a respective SIB and comprised<br>
in the reserved parts may have the following structure. Each control information<br>
associated to a SIB may indicate the position of SIB on the broadcast transport channel<br>
on which it is transmitted relative to common timing reference. Further, a repetition<br>
period of SIB may be indicated. This repetition period indicates the periodicity at which<br>
the respective SIB is transmitted. The control information may further include a timer<br>
value for timer-based update mechanism or, alternatively, a value tag for tag-based<br>
update of the SIB information.<br>
For SIBs whose reference in MIB contains timer value, a mobile terminal may update<br>
system information after expiry of value indicated in timer field of MIB. For SIBs whose<br>
reference in MIB contains value tag, a mobile terminal may update system information<br>
after the value of tag as indicated in respective field of MIB has been changed with<br>
respect to the value from the previous update. Respective exemplary MIB formats<br>
according to different embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to<br>
Fig. 11 and 13 below.<br>
The table below shows an exemplary overview of the categorization and types of system<br>
information blocks in an UMTS legacy system (see 3GPP TS 25.331, "Radio Resource<br>
Control (RRC)", version 6.7.0, section 8.1.1, incorporated herein by reference; available<br>
at http://www.3gpp.org) that may be used in the different embodiments of the invention<br>
described herein. In this example, the classification of the system broadcast information<br>
into the different SIBs is based on the content and temporal variability.<br><br><br><br>
The contents of the table illustrated above should be only considered as one possible<br>
example of the contents and classification of the broadcast system information. Also the<br>
classification of the frequency at which the different portions of the system information is<br>
broadcast and its classification into the different SIBs is intended to serve only for<br>
exemplary purposes and is not intended to limit the invention to this example. It is<br>
recognized that in the ongoing development and improvement of existing mobile<br>
communication systems, the content, format, periodicity of transmission, etc. may<br>
change.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an exemplary mapping of system information blocks of broadcast system<br>
information to a broadcast transport channel and a shared transport channel using Layer<br>
1 outband identification according to an embodiment of the invention. In Fig. 10, the data<br>
mapped to three different channels, a broadcast transport channel, a shared transport<br>
channel and a physical control channel associated to the shared transport channel, is<br>
shown. The control channel is associated to the shared transport channel in that it<br>
contains control information describing transmission format and timing of the data on the<br>
shared transport channel. In another embodiment of the invention the parameters<br>
describing transmission format may define the format for an OFDMA based radio access<br>
as described in Tdoc R1 -050604 of the 3GPP TSG RAN WG #1 ad hoc, "Downlink<br>
Channelization and Multiplexing for EUTRA", June 2005 (available at<br>
http://www.3gpp.org), incorporated herein by reference).<br><br>
Further, the mobile terminal (or, equivalent^, logical to transport channel mapping) to<br>
receive the system information may be designated by respective Layer 1 outband<br>
identification as discussed previously. Accordingly, the logical-to-transport channel<br>
mapping is indicated on the associated physical control channel (e.g. SCSCH).<br>
The broadcast system information provided on the broadcast control logical channel (e.g.<br>
the BCCH in UMTS), is mapped to the shared transport channel and the broadcast<br>
transport channel of Fig. 10.<br>
For the broadcast transport channel, three transport blocks are shown in Fig. 10. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, a Master Information Block (MIB) is transmitted periodically<br>
(MIB repetition period). For example, the MIB may be transmitted at the beginning of<br>
each transport block or after a predetermined time span, such as a given number of<br>
transmission time intervals (TTIs). Further, a transport block may comprise one or more<br>
System Information Blocks (SIBs). A SIB comprises a portion of the system broadcast<br>
information to be transmitted. For example, each SIB may comprise a predetermined or<br>
configurable set of information of a certain category as exemplified in the Table 5.<br>
The MIB used in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 10 is illustrated in Fig. 11 in<br>
further detail. The structure of system broadcast information according to this<br>
embodiment of the invention is also tree-like, as has been outlined above. The MIB<br>
comprises different partitions of control information each of these partitions being<br>
associated to a respective SIB.<br>
For those SIBs that are mapped to the broadcast transport channel for transmission, the<br>
control information associated to a respective SIB may have the following structure. Each<br>
control information associated to a SIB (pointer to SIB #n) indicates the position of the<br>
SIB on the broadcast transport channel on which it is transmitted relative to common<br>
timing reference. Further, a repetition period of SIB indicating the periodicity at which the<br>
respective SIB is transmitted may be indicated. In the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 10, the control information in the MIB associated to SIB1, SIB3, SIB 4 and SIB6<br>
have this structure.<br>
In contrast to SIB1, SIB3, SIB 4 and SIB6, SIB2 is transmitted via the shared transport<br>
channel. The MIB control information relating to SIB2 has a different structure than the<br>
control information for the set of SIBs. According to the exemplary embodiment, the<br>
control information for SIB2 in the MIB comprises an indication of the shared transport<br><br>
channel on which SIB2 is transmitted. This indication is illustrated by the dashed arrow<br>
pointing from the MIB to the shared transport channel in Fig. 10.<br>
Based on the control information in the MIB, the mobile terminals may recognize which<br>
SIBs are transmitted and to which channel they are mapped. I.e. in the exemplary<br>
; embodiment, the mobile terminals determine that SIB1, SIB3, SIB4 and SIB6 are<br>
mapped to and transmitted on the broadcast transport channel, while SIB2 is mapped to<br>
and transmitted on the shared transport channel.<br>
As indicated above, Layer 1 outband identification is used for indicating the logical<br>
channel-to-transport channel mapping to the receiving mobile terminals. For this purpose<br>
and identification of the mapping is transmitted on the associated control channel (see<br>
"ID"). This identification may for example use default or configured identifiers of the<br>
logical channel to which a respective transport channel is to be mapped on the receiving<br>
side. These identifiers may be transmitted by in the MIB.<br>
The identifiers may for example be HEX-values:<br>
■ 0x0000 OOFF logical channel BCCH (Broadcast Control Channel) is mapped<br>
upon SDCH,<br>
• 0x0100 01FF logical channel PCCH (Paging Control Channel) is mapped<br>
upon SDCH and<br>
0x0200 FFFF logical channel DCCH/DTCH<br>
(Dedicated Control Channel/ Dedicated Transport Channel) is<br>
mapped upon SDCH<br>
The identifiers used may be default values or may be configured by the system.<br>
The control channel associated to the shared transport channel comprises control<br>
information, which indicates the scheduling of the SIB on the shared transport channel.<br>
The control information may at least indicate temporal position of the SIB(s) mapped to<br>
the shared channel on that channel for a respective SIB. In another embodiment of the<br>
invention the control information on the associated control channel is scheduling<br>
information as shown in Table 3 above and may comprise information on chunk<br>
allocation, data modulation and transport block size. According to an embodiment of the<br>
invention the transmission format parameters may be defined as in in Tdoc R1 -050604<br>
3GPP TSG RAN WG1 ad hoc "Downlink Channelisation and Multiplexing for EUTRA".<br>
mentioned above,<br><br>
Hence, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 10, the MIB control information<br>
indicate to the mobile terminal that SIB2 has been mapped to the shared transport<br>
channel, while the control information for SIB on the associated control channel indicates<br>
the temporal position of SIB2 on the shared channel to a receiving mobile terminal and<br>
transmission format.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the temporal position can be given as<br>
dynamically changing scheduling information with respect to common system timing<br>
reference. An exemplary implementation is for example described in the TS 25.331<br>
"Radio Resource Control (RRC)" mentioned above. As explained above, the<br>
transmission format may indicate at least chunk allocation, data modulation and transport<br>
block size. Finally, although not explicitly mentioned, a configuration of the associated<br>
physical control channel (e.g. SCSCH) may also be necessary.<br>
Returning to the transmission of broadcast system information in UMTS systems for<br>
exemplary purposes only, Layer 1 outband identification and transmission of scheduling<br>
information are specific for shared downlink transport channel while scheduling<br>
information of system information blocks conveyed via broadcast transport channel is<br>
transmitted within the Master Information Block of the broadcast transport channel, that<br>
is within Layer 2 transport blocks. The configuration of the broadcast transport channel<br>
may be for example semi-static, while the configuration of the shared downlink transport<br>
channel may be semi-static or dynamic. The flexibility of dynamic configuration of the<br>
shared transport channel in this embodiment of the invention may be advantageous from<br>
radio resource utilization perspective since fast scheduling of broadcast system<br>
information could be efficiently supported.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the shared transport channel may be the<br>
Shared Downlink CHannel (SDCH) of a UMTS system, while the broadcast transport<br>
channel may be the Broadcast CHannel (BCH); the control channel associated to the<br>
SDCH may be the Shared Control Signaling Channel (SCSCH).<br>
Fig. 12 shows another exemplary mapping of system information blocks of broadcast<br>
system information to a broadcast transport channel and a shared transport channel<br>
using Layer 2 inband identification according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Fig. 12, a shared channel is used without the<br>
need of an associated (physical) control channel for identification. As in the embodiment<br>
of the invention described with respect to Fig. 10 and 11, also in the embodiment shown<br><br>
in Fig. 12 broadcast system information is mapped to a broadcast transport channel and<br>
a shared transport channel. The identifier ("ID) indicating the logical channel-to-transport<br>
channel mapping and semi-static configuration information (timing and transmission<br>
format) of the shared channel (e.g. SDCH) and configuration of associated physical<br>
control channel (e.g. SCSCH) are transmitted inband. This means that both pieces of<br>
information are transmitted at Layer 2. For example, the identification ("ID") may be<br>
provided within the header of Layer 2 packets of the shared transport channel, while the<br>
configuration information of shared channel may be provided within MIB.<br>
The identifier ID may be a default identifier or may be configured/assigned through MIB<br>
of the broadcast transport channel, as described above. Fig. 13 shows an exemplary<br>
format of a Master Information Block used in the mapping of system information blocks in<br>
Fig. 12. The structure of the control information for SIBs mapped to the broadcast<br>
transport channel is similar to that in the MIB shown in Fig. 11. The MIB control<br>
information of the SIBs mapped to the shared transport channel may in addition<br>
comprise an indication of the shared transport channel to which they have been mapped<br>
respectively.<br>
In the following paragraphs the mapping of the system information blocks transporting<br>
the individual portions of the broadcast system information of the broadcast control<br>
logical channel according to different embodiments will be described. In the following<br>
embodiments of the invention described with respect to Fig. 14 to 18, the broadcast<br>
system information is transmitted in system information blocks that are mapped to a<br>
broadcast transport channel or a shared transport channel using either Layer 1 outband<br>
identification (Fig. 10 and 11) or Layer 2 inband identification (Fig. 12 and 13). As will be<br>
explained in the following, the mapping may be based for example on a property /<br>
properties inherent to a respective SIB or the mobile terminals to receive the SIBs.<br>
Fig. 8 and 9 show the transmission of broadcast information over broadcast transport<br>
channel on a time axis. Fig. 8 is plotted for spectrum allocation of 5 MHz and broadcast<br>
data rate of 16 kbps. Fig. 9 is plotted for spectrum allocation of 10 MHz and broadcast<br>
data rate of 32 kbps.<br>
In Fig. 14 to 18, the spectrum allocation of either 5 MHz or 10 MHz is assumed and<br>
respective data rates of 16 or 32 kbps are (usually unevenly) distributed between<br>
broadcast and shared transport channel. By mapping broadcast system information to<br>
broadcast and shared transport channels a more flexible transmission scheme for<br><br>
broadcast system information may be in comparison to cases where broadcast system<br>
information is mapped only to a broadcast transport channel. For example, in Fig. 15 the<br>
data rate of broadcast and shared transport channel is divided in ratio 3:1 since the<br>
resulting data rate on the shared channel is sufficient to transmit SIB1 over the shared<br>
transport channel in one TTI, as will be explained below.<br>
It should be noted that the actual resource utilization is not precisely plotted in Fig. 8, 9<br>
and 14 to 18.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a criterion based on which the mapping of<br>
SIBs to either a shared transport channel or a broadcast transport channel is decided,<br>
may be the importance of the information of a respective SIB for mobile terminals.<br>
Information important for mobile terminals may for example be system information that is<br>
necessary to be received, stored and kept up-to-date by mobile terminal in order to<br>
perform system access and elementary mobility procedures.<br>
Considering for exemplary purposes only a UMTS system, system access may<br>
designate the procedure aimed at establishing signaling connection (signaling radio<br>
bearer). Hence, in this exemplary scenario the important information is information<br>
necessary for the mobile terminal to establish a signaling connection. Elementary<br>
mobility procedures on the other hand designate the procedures aimed at tracking user<br>
location by the network on tracking area level - without established signaling connection<br>
- and on cell level - with established signaling connection.<br>
Following the definition of important information and considering the exemplary<br>
classification of broadcast system information as shown in Table 5, SIB1, SIB2, SIBS,<br>
SIB5, SIB6, SIB17 and SIB18 may be classified as information important for mobile<br>
terminals, since they are necessary for performing system access and elementary<br>
mobility procedures. On the other hand, for example SIB13 and SIB15 may be classified<br>
as information not important (optional) for mobile terminals since they are not necessary<br>
for performing system access and elementary mobility procedures.<br>
Fig. 14 shows an exemplary mapping of system information blocks to a shared transport<br>
channel having a 5 MHz spectrum allocation and a data rate of 8 kbps and a broadcast<br>
control channel also having a 5 MHz spectrum allocation and a data rate of 8 kbps<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 14 proposes a mapping overcoming<br>
the problems discussed with respect to Fig. 8, where the mobile terminal had to receive<br><br>
two successive TTIs to obtain the important SIB8. In Fig. 14, SIB8 is now mapped to the<br>
shared transport channel, which allows transmitting SIB8 in a single TTI, thereby<br>
reducing power consumption of the mobile terminal. Further, the MIB can be transmitted<br>
simultaneously (i.e. in the same TTI) as SIB8 which allows the mobile terminal to acquire<br>
the important information in SIB8 faster compared to the scenario in Fig.8.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 14, the mapping of SIB8 to the shared<br>
channel has been based on the importance of the information contained in SIB8 for the<br>
mobile terminals. Another criterion may be the size of the SIBs. For example, SIBs larger<br>
than a predetermined threshold may be mapped to the shared transport channel. For<br>
example, this option may be of advantage, if several TTIs would be required for the<br>
transmission of the SIB of broadcast transport channel and/or the shared transport<br>
channel can be sent with higher data rate than that used for the broadcast transport<br>
channel.<br>
Fig. 15 shows an exemplary mapping of system information blocks to a shared transport<br>
channel having a 10 MHz spectrum allocation and a data rate of 24 kbps and a<br>
broadcast control channel also having a 10 MHz spectrum allocation and a data rate of 8<br>
kbps according to an embodiment of the invention. This exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrates an improvement of the system information allocation in Fig. 9, where SIB1 has<br>
been the only SIB containing information relevant for the mobile terminal (the MIB may<br>
not be read every time it is transmitted). Though the mobile terminal may only be<br>
interested in the content of SIB1 of Fig. 9, it would need to read the whole content<br>
broadcast on the broadcast transport channel within a TTI, since receivers may typically<br>
only be tuned to receive data within a whole TTI.<br>
According to the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 15, the SIB(s) comprising information<br>
important for the mobile terminals are mapped to the shared transport channel, while<br>
SIBs carrying optional information, i.e. information not important for the mobile terminals<br>
are mapped to the broadcast transport channel. Assuming that the content of SIB2 and<br>
SIB3 in Fig. 15 is optional information and that the mobile terminal may not need to read<br>
the MIB in this TTI, the mobile terminal may only read the shared transport channel<br>
carrying SIB1 from the shared transport channel and may save power by not reading the<br>
broadcast transport channel in that TTI.<br>
Further, considering that the data rates on shared transport channel and broadcast<br>
transport channel may vary from each other, another benefit of the mapping of SIBs to a<br><br>
shared transport channel offering a lower data rate than the broadcast transport channel<br>
may be an increase in the reliability of the transmitted information in the SIBs transmitted<br>
on the shared transport channel. Since a lower data rate may also imply a lower coding<br>
rate and/or a lower order modulation scheme being used compared to the configuration<br>
of the broadcast control channel, the information transmitted via the shared transport<br>
channel may have a higher reliability. In UMTS systems, the configuration of the<br>
broadcast transport channel may be static and hence its data rate may not be changed.<br>
Another criterion that may be considered for mapping of SIBs to a shared transport<br>
channel or a broadcast transport channel may be the features supported by the mobile<br>
terminals within a certain cell. For example, if none of the mobile terminals currently<br>
present in a cell are supporting positioning based on GPS (Global Positioning System),<br>
the related SIB may be omitted from broadcast on the broadcast transport channel and<br>
may be instead transmitted via a shared transport channel. Advantageously, the SIB may<br>
be transmitted during discontinuous reception (DRX) periods on the shared transport<br>
channel, if mobile terminals supporting GPS connect / are handed over to the cell. Hence<br>
resources can be dynamically shared with user plane data.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a mapping of SIBs to a shared or broadcast transport channel based on<br>
the variability of the information in the respective SIB according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. SIBs that comprise broadcast system information of high variability may be<br>
mapped to the shared transport channel. Considering a classification of broadcast<br>
system information as shown in Table 5 above, e.g. physical channel configuration,<br>
interference and dynamic persistence level may be considered SIBs comprising<br>
information undergoing frequent changes. Further, as indicated above, depending on the<br>
data rate distribution between the broadcast transport channel and the shared transport<br>
channel, the transmission of frequently changing SIBs via the shared transport channel<br>
may allow for lower repetition periods or alternatively increase the reliability of the<br>
transmission of the respective SIBs.<br>
To generically classify information according to temporal variability, rates f1 and f2<br>
(f1<f2 describing frequency of change this information may be considered. for></f2>
example, an information (SIB) may be classified to be of low temporal variability, if its<br>
rate of change f relates to ft as f
variability, if its rate of change f relates to f2 as f&gt;=f2. Finally, information is of medium<br>
temporal variability, if its rate of change f relates to f1 and f2 as f1<f></f><br>
Another possible mapping of SIBs to a shared transport channel and a broadcast<br>
transport channel according to a further embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 17.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment only optional information (i.e. information not important for<br>
the mobile terminals) is mapped upon shared channel. The optional information may for<br>
example be ANSI 42 information or GPS information. This mapping may be beneficial in<br>
that the mobile terminals would only need to acquire necessary information from<br>
broadcast transport channel and without reading shared transport channel. Only if a<br>
mobile terminal would support a feature for which the optional information is needed, it<br>
may read the respective SIBs from the shared transport channel.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the configuration of shared transport channel<br>
used for the transmission of broadcast system information in neighboring cells may be<br>
broadcast to the mobile terminals of a cell. Accordingly, Fig. 18 shows a mapping of<br>
system information blocks of broadcast system information comprising information on a<br>
shared transport channel in a neighboring radio cell to a broadcast transport channel and<br>
a shared transport channel and a handover of a mobile terminal to the neighboring radio<br>
cell according to an embodiment of the invention. In the exemplary embodiment, it may<br>
be assumed that the shared transport channel in a respective cell is used to provide<br>
system broadcast information to the mobile terminals that is important information, i.e.<br>
information necessary to perform system access and elementary mobility procedures.<br>
In Fig. 18, at the time instant n+1 (the time instants are given by the number of TTIs<br>
having past since a given starting time) the mobile terminal starts receiving the MIB via<br>
the broadcast transport channel. Further it may be assumed that SIB8 in each radio cell<br>
comprises information necessary to perform system access and elementary mobility<br>
procedures. The dashed blocks are intended to indicate, that the mobile terminal<br>
receiving the information is located in a source cell, when receiving the information. The<br>
MIB received in the TTI following time instant n+1 may comprise an indication to the<br>
shared transport channel at which SIB8 is broadcast in a neighboring cell(s).<br>
Alternatively, a SIB containing this information may be specified by the MIB (for example<br>
SIB3 read by the mobile terminal at the TTI starting at time instant n).<br>
Upon the time instant n+2, the mobile terminal is handed over from its source cell to<br>
another cell, the target cell. Since it has already acquired the control information<br>
necessary to receive SIB8 on the shared transport channel, the mobile terminal may<br>
already read SIB8 from the shared transport channel of the target cell at time instant<br>
n+2. Hence, the mobile terminal may not need to receive the first MIB in the target cell<br><br>
transmitted at time instant n+3 on the broadcast transport channel to be able to read<br>
SI68 from the shared transport channel at time instant n+4.<br>
More generally, information on the configuration of the neighboring cells (including the<br>
target cell) may be provided as part of the broadcast system information within a cell.<br>
The configuration information on the neighboring cells may be for example included in a<br>
system information block or may be provided as part of the MIB to the mobile terminals<br>
of a radio cell. The configuration information may depend on the respective mapping<br>
used for transmission of the broadcast system information via the shared transport<br>
channel and the broadcast transport channel in a respective neighboring cell.<br>
If a configuration as shown in Fig. 10 is used, the MIB may comprise chunk allocation<br>
and possibly modulation format, transport block size etc. of the control physical channel<br>
associated to the shared transport channel in the neighboring cell(s). The associated<br>
