BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The explosive growth in wireless applications and devices over the past few<br>
years has produced tremendous public interest benefits. Wireless networks and<br>
devices have been deployed in millions of offices, homes, and more recently, in<br>
increasing numbers of public areas. These wireless deployments are forecast to<br>
continue at an exciting pace and offer the promise of increased convenience and<br>
productivity.<br>
This growth, which is taking place mostly in the unlicensed bands, is not<br>
without its downsides. In the United States, the unlicensed bands established by<br>
the FCC consist of large portions of spectrum at 2.4 GHz and at 5 GHz, which are<br>
free to use. The FCC currently sets requirements for the unlicensed bands such as<br>
limits on transmit power spectral density and limits on antenna gain. It is well<br>
recognized that as unlicensed band devices become more popular and their density<br><br>
in a given area increases, a "tragedy of the commons" effect will often become<br>
apparent and overall wireless utility (and user satisfaction) will collapse. This<br>
phenomenon has already been observed in environments that have a high density of<br>
wireless devices.<br>
The types of signaling protocols used by devices in the unlicensed bands are<br>
not designed to cooperate with signals of other types also operating in the bands.<br>
For example, a frequency hopping signal (e.g., a signal emitted from a device that<br>
uses the Bluetoothâ„¢ communication protocol or a signal emitted from certain<br>
cordless phones) may hop into the frequency channel of an IEEE 802.11 wireless<br>
local area network (WLAN), causing interference with operation of the WLAN.<br>
Thus, technology is needed to exploit all of the benefits of the unlicensed band<br>
without degrading the level of service that users expect.<br>
Historically, the wireless industry's general approach to solving "tragedy of<br>
the commons" problems has been for manufacturers to simply move to another<br>
commons further up the spectrum. This solution, however, is not workable for<br>
much longer, due to spectrum scarcity and to the less attractive technical<br>
characteristics of the higher bands (decreased signal propagation and the inability<br>
to penetrate surfaces).<br>
Enterprise uses of the unlicensed band are focused on larger scale<br>
deployment of wireless networks (e.g., WLANs) and integration into wired<br>
networks. WLANs can complicate existing network management schemes because<br>
they introduce the additional requirement of efficiently managing radio spectrum.<br>
Current WLAN systems and management technology are focused on managing<br>
activity at the network level of the WLAN, but provide little of no capability to<br>
manage the frequency band where signals of multiple types (e.g., communication<br>
protocol/network types, device types, etc.) are present. What is needed is<br>
technology to obtain and use knowledge of what is happening in a shared radio<br>
frequency band, such as an unlicensed band, to enable devices to act intelligently<br>
with respect to their use of the frequency thereby maintaining the performance of<br>
devices and networks of devices operating in that frequency band.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, system, method, software and related functions are provided for<br>
managing activity in a radio frequency band that is shared, both in frequency and<br>
time, by signals of multiple disparate types and devices of various technologies.<br>
An example of such a frequency band is an unlicensed frequency band. Radio<br>
frequency energy in the frequency band is captured at one or more devices and/or<br>
locations in a region where activity in the frequency band is happening. Signals<br>
occurring in the frequency band are detected by sampling part or the entire<br>
frequency band for time intervals. Signal pulse energy in the band is detected and<br>
is used to classify signals according to signal type. Using knowledge of the types<br>
of signals occurring in the frequency band and other spectrum activity related<br>
statistics (referred to as spectrum intelligence), actions can be taken in a device or<br>
network of devices to avoid interfering with other signals, and in general to<br>
optimize simultaneous use of the frequency band with the other signals. The<br>
spectrum intelligence may be used to suggest actions to a device user or network<br>
administrator, or to automatically invoke actions in a device or network of devices<br>
to maintain desirable performance.<br>
Devices using the unlicensed or shared frequency bands may adopt the<br>
features and functions described herein to better facilitate band sharing and<br>
coexistence between a multitude of devices that use disparate technologies. A<br>
device with the ability to gather intelligence and act on it, or act on the intelligence<br>
acquired by other devices, is referred to herein as a "cognitive radio device." Any<br>
device that operates in a shared frequency band may contain varying degrees of<br>
cognitive radio to sense their local radio environment and/or detect the presence<br>
(and application needs) of other devices that are accessing the same unlicensed<br>
band. The capability of sensing, detecting and classifying other users of the shared<br>
frequency band in a device's vicinity is important to being able to determine how a<br>
device can most effectively use the spectrum. This cognitive radio philosophy<br>
applies to both individual devices and to networks of devices.<br>
Cognitive radio devices enable robust and efficient use of the unlicensed<br>
bands and facilitate secondary access applications. Cognitive radios can sense their<br>
radio environment, detect the presence of other wireless devices, classify those<br><br>
other devices, and then implement application specific-communications policies.<br>
Cognitive radios can also be equipped with location-sensing features to help them<br>
determine the manner in which they can most effectively communicate, or in the<br>
case of secondary access, whether they may access certain spectrum at all.<br>
Cognitive radios benefit both the cognitive radio device users and the other<br>
"dumb" device users that are operating nearby. Through spectrum awareness of<br>
their radio environments, cognitive radio devices can avoid interference from other<br>
devices and thereby maintain more reliable wireless connections than dumb<br>
devices, which are unable to adapt their behavior. Because cognitive radio devices<br>
can adapt to their environment to, for example, transmit on less crowded<br>
frequencies, they cause less radio interference than dumb devices. This leads to<br>
improvements in the user experience for both cognitive radio and dumb device<br>
users.<br>
As with licensed wireless applications, predictability of performance is<br>
important to the satisfactory delivery of unlicensed band wireless services. The<br>
successful provision of cognitive spectrum management techniques has the<br>
potential to help unlicensed band applications evolve from today's view of wireless<br>
as convenient though often secondary, to one in which unlicensed band connections<br>
are viewed as reliable, primary, and robust.<br>
Unlike wired and licensed band wireless connections in which access to the<br>
media is controlled and effectively managed, the unlicensed bands are available for<br>
use by disparate wireless technologies. The consequences for a device operating in<br>
such an environment in terms of performance can be catastrophic. For example,<br>
and as described above, two commercially successful unlicensed standards, IEEE<br>
802.1 lb and Bluetooth, behave "unintelligently" when operating in the vicinity of<br>
each other.<br>
Through intelligent use of the unlicensed bands, overall capacity can be<br>
increased and satisfy the needs of more users. Frequency re-use in which the same<br>
band is used in multiple geographical areas has been shown to dramatically<br>
increase the capacity. Reducing a "frequency cell" size as currently demonstrated<br>
by licensed band operators allows higher overall throughput at the expense of<br>
additional equipment. Power level limitations in the unlicensed bands makes<br><br>
frequency re-use a virtual necessity in the provision of wireless services over areas<br>
beyond a few hundred square meters. By adopting intelligent power control<br>
mechanisms, frequency re-use in the unlicensed bands can be further extended.<br>
For so-called Personal Area Network (PAN) applications, in which the<br>
range of wireless connectivity is limited to a few meters, the level of interference<br>
created by such PAN devices may be made to be very low by controlling the output<br>
power to the lowest possible level to sustain its wireless connection. For those<br>
cases in which devices are able to sense that no other devices in its vicinity are<br>
competing for the wireless medium, it could transmit at as high a data rate as<br>
possible, using as much spectrum as needed, without degrading performance to<br>
other nearby devices. Upon detecting the presence of other devices accessing the<br>
spectrum, the device could subsequently reduce its bandwidth usage to minimize<br>
interference to other devices. Such flexible and intelligent use of the unlicensed<br>
band is an example of a cognitive radio device.<br>
The ability of devices to recognize and react to the occupancy of its local<br>
RF environment through measurement and classification opens up the opportunity<br>
to substantially increase wireless capacity by enabling short-range wireless devices<br>
as secondary access users on unoccupied licensed bands. Through spectrum<br>
management, this access can be provided without impacting the services provided<br>
on these licensed bands.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The system, methods, software and other technologies described herein are<br>
designed to cooperatively manage use of a shared frequency band where signals of<br>
multiple types occur (often simultaneously), such as an unlicensed band, and<br>
interference among the users of the band may occur. Many of the concepts<br>
described herein may apply to frequency bands that are not necessarily<br>
"unlicensed," such as when a licensed frequency band is used for secondary<br>
licensed or unlicensed purposes.<br>
The term "network" is used hereinafter in many ways. There may be one or<br>
more wireless networks each comprising multiple devices or nodes that operate in<br>
the shared frequency band. One example of such a network is a WLAN. There are<br><br>
also networks, called piconets, which are formed with Bluetoothâ„¢ capable<br>
devices. Many of the examples described herein are made with respect to an IEEE<br>
802.11 WLAN, mostly due in part to the expansive use that the WLAN has seen,<br>
and is expected to continue to see. In addition, the term network is referred to a<br>
wired network, and to an aggregation of one or more wired and wireless networks.<br>
The spectrum management systems, methods, software and device features<br>
described herein new are not limited to any particular wireless network, and are<br>
equally applicable to any wireless network technologies now known or hereinafter<br>
developed for use in a shared frequency band.<br>
Referring first to FIG. 1, an environment is shown where there are multiple<br>
devices that at some point in their modes of operation transmit or emit signals<br>
within a common frequency band, and that may at least partially overlap in<br>
frequency and time. When these devices are sufficiently close in proximity to<br>
each other, or transmit signals at sufficiently high power levels, there will<br>
inevitably be interference between signals of one or more devices. The dotted-line<br>
shown in FIG. 1 is meant to indicate a region where activity from any of the<br>
devices shown may impact other devices. FIG. 1 shows a non-exhaustive<br>
exemplary selection of devices that may operate in an unlicensed frequency band,<br>
including cordless phones 1000, frequency hopping communication devices 1010,<br>
microwave ovens 1020, a wireless local area network (WLAN) comprised of a<br>
WLAN access point 1050(1) and its associated client station (STAs) 1030(1),<br>
1030(2) to 1030(N), infant monitor devices 1060 as well as any other existing or<br>
new wireless devices 1070. Multiple WLAN APs 1050(1) to 1050(N) may be<br>
operating in the region, each of which has one or more associated client STAs<br>
1030(1) to 1030(N). Alternatively, the region shown in FIG. 1 may be one of a<br>
multitude of other similar regions where activity in the frequency band is<br>
occurring. Depending on the desired coverage area, one or more APs may be<br>
assigned to corresponding ones of several regions, each region possibly shared with<br>
other users such as those shown in the single region of FIG. 1. One or more of the<br>
WLAN APs 1050(1) to 1050(N) may be connected to a wired network (e.g.,<br>
Ethernet network) to which also connected is a server 1055. Cordless phones 1000<br>
may be analog, digital and frequency hopping devices, depending on the type.<br><br>
Frequency hopping communication devices 1010 may include devices operating in<br>
accordance with the Bluetoothâ„¢ wireless communication protocol, the HomeRFâ„¢<br>
wireless communication protocol, as well as cordless phones. In addition, radar<br>
devices 1080 may operate in an unlicensed frequency band. Other devices that<br>
may operate in the frequency band may also include appliances such as digital (still<br>
and/or) video cameras, cable-set top boxes, etc.<br>
As will become more apparent hereinafter, the spectrum management<br>
methods described herein may be implemented in any device or network of devices<br>
operating in the frequency band (such as those shown in FIG. 1). The necessary<br>
hardware and/or software functionalities would be deployed in the<br>
hardware/software platform of that device to enable the device to act as a cognitive<br>
radio device and thereby perform the spectrum management steps of signal<br>
detecting, accumulating/measuring, classifying and controlling/reporting. For<br>
example, a cognitive radio device supporting a WLAN application can make more<br>
intelligent spectrum access and waveform decisions, and ultimately provide a<br>
higher link reliability, by adapting at least one of: its data rate, packet size,<br>
frequency channel, transmit power, etc., after classifying an interferer as a<br>
microwave oven, a frequency hopping device or alternatively, another WLAN.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, spectrum management may be implemented<br>
by deploying a plurality of spectrum sensors 1200(1) to 1200(N) shown in FIG. 1<br>
in various locations where activity associated with any of the plurality of signal<br>
types is occurring in the frequency band to form a sensor overlay network. The<br>
spectrum intelligence gathered by the spectrum sensors is fed to one or several<br>
processing platforms such as a network management station 1090 or server 1055,<br>
the host processor of an AP, etc., where policy decisions are made and controls<br>
may be generated. For example, there may be another server 1057 that executes a<br>
WLAN management application for the APs 1050(1) to 1050(N). The server 1055<br>
or network management station 1090 may generate controls or reports to the server<br>
1057 that affect changes in one or more APs.<br>
The network management station 1090, server 1055 and server 1057 need<br>
not physically reside in the region where the other devices are operating. The<br>
network management station 1090 may be connected to the same wired network as<br><br>
the server 1055 and may receive spectrum activity information from one or more<br>
WLAN APs 1050(1) to 1050(N) and/or from one or more spectrum sensors<br>
1200(1) to 1200(N). The network management station 1090 has, for example, a<br>
processor 1092, a memory 1094 that stores one or more software programs<br>
executed by the processor and a display monitor 1096. The network management<br>
station 1090 may also execute one or more software programs that manage wired<br>
networks as well as wireless networks, such as WLANs served by the WLAN APs<br>
1050(1) to 1050(N). The spectrum sensors 1200(1) to 1200(N) may be connected<br>
to an AP, to the server 1055 or to the spectrum management station 1090 by a<br>
wired or wireless connection.<br>
Currently, in the United States, the unlicensed frequency bands are in the<br>
Industry, Scientific and Medical (ISM) and UNII frequency bands, and include an<br>
unlicensed frequency band at 2.4 GHz and unlicensed frequency bands at or near<br>
5GHz. These are only examples of existing unlicensed bands. In other countries,<br>
other portions of the spectrum have been, or may be, set aside of unlicensed use.<br>
By definition, an "unlicensed" frequency band generally means that no one user<br>
has any preferred rights to use that frequency band over another. No one party has<br>
purchased exclusive rights to that spectrum. There are a set of basic power and<br>
bandwidth requirements associated with the unlicensed band, but any user that<br>
operates within those requirements is free to use it at any time. A consequence of<br>
the "unlicensed" character of these frequency bands is that devices operating in<br>
them will inevitably interfere with the operation of each other. When interference<br>
occurs, a signal from one device to another may not be received properly, causing<br>
the sending device to retransmit (and therefore reducing throughput), or possibly â€¢<br>
entirely destroying the communication link between two communication devices.<br>
Moreover, because these frequency bands are free to use, the zero-cost encourages<br>
more applications and users of the unlicensed band, which in turn, will make it<br>
more crowded and more susceptible to interference. There is, therefore, a need to<br>
manage the operation of devices operating in an unlicensed frequency band to<br>
ensure efficient and fair usage by all users.<br>
FIGs. 2 and 3 illustrate some examples of the spectral usage of two<br>
unlicensed bands in the United States. FIG. 2 shows the spectral profiles of<br><br>
exemplary devices that operate in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency band such as,<br>
for example, frequency hopper devices, cordless phones, IEEE 802.1 lb WLAN<br>
communication devices, infant monitor devices and microwave ovens. A<br>
frequency hopping device will occupy a predictable or random frequency sub-band<br>
at any given time, and therefore, over time, may span the entire frequency band. A<br>
cordless phone, of the non-frequency hopping variety, may occupy one of several<br>
frequency sub-bands (channels) at any given time. An IEEE 802.1 lb device will<br>
typically occupy one of three RF channels in the 2.4 GHz band at any given time,<br>
and an infant monitor is similar. A microwave oven will emit a burst of energy that<br>
may span a significant portion of the unlicensed band. Other devices that may<br>
operate in the 2.4 GHz band are IEEE 802.11 g WLAN devices.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a similar set of circumstances for a 5 GHz unlicensed band.<br>
There are actually three unlicensed frequency bands at 5 GHz in the United States.<br>
Two of these are contiguous and the third is not contiguous with the other two<br>
(which for simplicity is not considered in FIG. 3). In the 5 GHz unlicensed bands,<br>
there may be IEEE 802.11a WLAN devices operating in 8 different frequency sub-<br>
bands (channels), direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) cordless phones, and<br>
various radar devices.<br>
Managing an unlicensed band where signals of multiple types may be<br>
simultaneously occurring involves minimizing interference and maximizing<br>
spectrum efficiency. Minimizing interference is expressed in terms of signal-to-<br>
noise ratio (SNR), bit error rate (BER), etc., and maximizing spectrum efficiency is<br>
expressed as data rate per bandwidth used per area (bps/Hz/m2) or as a number of<br>
"satisfied" users, where satisfied is based on meeting certain performance criteria<br>
such as: data rate; latency; jitter; dropped sessions; and blocked sessions. The goal<br>
of spectrum management is to take evasive action to avoid interference when<br>
possible, detect and report interference when it occurs and make intelligent<br>
decisions to mitigate interference when it cannot be avoided. Moreover, spectrum<br>
management is flexible to handle different end user demands and the emergence of<br>
new devices and types of devices.<br>
FIGs. 4 and 5 illustrate the general concepts associated with spectrum<br>
management of an unlicensed frequency band. Information about the activity in<br><br>
the frequency band, called spectrum activity information, is obtained from any one<br>
of several devices operating in the frequency having a certain degree of capability<br>
described hereinafter in conjunction with FIGs. 7 and 8. This is referred to as<br>
spectrum sampling in step 2000 and may involve sampling radio frequency energy<br>
in the entire frequency band for a time period or scanning sub-bands of the<br>
frequency band (on demand or periodically), to determine spectral-based and time-<br>
based activity in the frequency band. It is possible that each of the steps shown in<br>
FIG. 5 is performed within a radio device, e.g., a cognitive radio device.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, spectrum activity information is gathered at multiple<br>
devices (such as at multiple spectrum sensors of a sensor overlay network) and the<br>
spectrum activity information processed at a computing device to generate reports<br>
and/or controls for one or more devices or network of devices (e.g., one or more<br>
APs) operating in the frequency band. The spectrum intelligence, whether gathered<br>
and used at the same device, or gathered from a sensor overlay network, may be<br>
used to interface spectrum aware reports or controls to a generalize network<br>
management application that manages wired and wireless networks in an<br>
enterprise, for example.<br>
For example, as shown in FIG. 4, spectrum activity information is obtained<br>
at one or more APs 1050(1) to 1050(N) and/or at one or more spectrum sensors<br>
1200(1) to 1200(N) of a sensor overlay network, or any other device equipped with<br>
certain capability described hereinafter. For example, three spectrum sensors are<br>
shown in FIG. 4 that would be positioned at various locations in a locality or<br>
premises. The spectrum activity information can be generated locally in a device<br>
capable of receiving signals in the frequency band, or raw data output by a radio<br>
receiver (or data converters coupled to the output of the receiver) in a device is<br>
coupled to another device not necessarily operating in the frequency band or<br>
residing local to those devices operating in the frequency band. The spectrum<br>
activity information may comprise information related to the activity in the<br>
frequency band as a whole, as well as statistics associated with a wireless network<br>
operating in the frequency band, such as IEEE 802.11x WLAN statistics, which<br>
may be obtained by an AP or STA operating in the WLAN.<br><br>
Some cognitive radio devices may know the spectrum activity situation that<br>
affects only their surroundings/environment. Other higher intelligent devices may<br>
know the spectrum activity situation for themselves and for all of the devices<br>
connected to them. For example, a STA may have cognitive radio capability for<br>
itself, but the AP that it associates with has the intelligence of each of its ST As as<br>
well as its own. However, an AP may advise a STA about the spectrum situation<br>
at the AP or other STAs. Moving higher in the hierarchy, a server that manages<br>
multiple APs will have intelligence for the entire multiple AP network. When<br>
spectrum activity information is sent "upstream" for further processing, it may be<br>
distilled down to the necessary components or elements, or compressed.<br>
The spectrum activity information (or the raw data used to generate it) is<br>
reported locally, or remotely, to other devices to display, analyze and/or generate<br>
real-time alerts related to activity in the frequency band. Moreover, the spectrum<br>
activity information can be accumulated and stored on a short-term basis (seconds<br>
or minutes) or a long-term basis (minutes to hours) for subsequent analysis. For<br>
example, the long-term storage of spectrum activity information may be useful for<br>
data mining and other non-real-time processing applications, described further<br>
hereinafter.<br>
In addition, or separately from the reporting function, the spectrum activity<br>
information may be processed in a processor (local to or remote from the source<br>
devices of the actual spectrum activity information). The signal classification step<br>
2010 involves processing the output of the spectrum sampling step to measure and<br>
classify signals based on characteristics such as power, duration, bandwidth,<br>
frequency hopping nature. The output of the signal classification step 2010 is data<br>
classifying the signals/devices detected. A classification output may be, for<br>
example, "cordless phone", "frequency hopper device", "frequency hopper cordless<br>
phone", "microwave oven", "802.11x WLAN device", etc. The signal<br>
classification information generated by processing the spectrum activity<br>
information may be reported, like the spectrum activity information, to local or<br>
remote locations, and used to generate real-time alerts. For example, when an<br>
interference condition (presence of another signal in the frequency band of<br>
operation, adjacent frequency channel of operation, etc., of a device or network of<br><br>
devices in the frequency band) is detected, a real-time alert may be generated to<br>
advise a network administrator about the condition. The real-time alert may take<br>
the form of a graphical display, audio, email message, paging message, etc. The<br>
alert may include recommendations to a user or to a network administrator to make<br>
adjustments to a device or network of devices operating in the frequency band.<br>
The policy execution step 2020 involves determining what, if anything,<br>
should be done about the information output by the signal classification step 2010.<br>
For example, the policies dictate what spectrum actions in or controls of a<br>
communication device or network of devices to take on the basis of the output of<br>
the signal classification step 2010. The output of the policy execution step 2020<br>
may include recommended actions to a network administrator, application program<br>
or system, to take in order to remedy or adjust for a situation. In addition, in<br>
processing the spectrum activity information, controls may be generated to adjust<br>
one or more operating parameters of devices or networks of devices operating in<br>
the frequency band. The spectrum actions step 2030 generates the particular<br>
controls to effect the actions. Examples of controls are: assigning a device to a<br>
different frequency sub-band or channel in the frequency band (dynamic frequency<br>
selectionâ€”DFS), network load balancing (on the basis of channel frequencies or<br>
time), adjusting the transmit power (transmit power controlâ€”TPC), adjusting the<br>
communication data rate, adjusting a parameter of the transmitted data packet,<br>
executing interference mitigation or co-existence algorithms, executing spectrum<br>
etiquette procedures, executing spectrum priority schemes, or re-assigning STAs to<br>
APs in a WLAN. Examples of interference mitigation algorithms are disclosed in<br>
commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020061031,<br>
published, May 23, 2002. Other actions that can be taken include reporting<br>
spectrum activity information to users and administrators to enable human<br>
intelligence interaction to diagnose problems, optimize network settings and<br>
remove interference sources. Even when an adjustment is made automatically, an<br>
event report or alert may be generated to advise a network administrator of the<br>
condition. The controls may be at the specific device level to change an<br>
operational parameter of a device, or at a network level to change an operational<br>
parameter of a wireless network operating in the frequency band, such as by<br><br>
altering one or more operational parameters used by an IEEE 802.11x AP device,<br>
that affects how the STAs associated with that AP operate in that wireless network.<br>
The control signals may be generated in a device that is actually operating<br>
in the frequency band (see FIGs. 11 and 12) or in a computing device that is remote<br>
from those devices operating in the frequency band. For this latter case, the<br>
network management station 1090 or the server 1055 (FIG. 1) may receive<br>
spectrum activity information and generate the control signals. The control signals<br>
are then in turn delivered back to one or more devices operating in the frequency<br>
band. For example, if the control signal pertains to a parameter of a WLAN AP or<br>
ST A, then the control signal may be delivered by the network management station<br>
1090 or server 1055 via the network connection to one or more APs (e.g., one or<br>
more of APs 1050(1) to 1050(N) shown in FIG. 1). The AP will receive the control<br>
signal and change one of its operational parameters. In addition, the control signal<br>
may be delivered to a particular STA by supplying the appropriate command to that<br>
STA's AP to cause the AP to transmit the parameter change information to the<br>
STA.<br>
A Spectrum Management Architecture<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a spectrum management system architecture will be<br>
described. This architecture will be described beginning with the "lowest" level<br>
and working upwards to higher levels. The annotations on the sides of the blocks<br>
in FIG. 6 are meant to indicate where these processes may be performed, which<br>
will become more apparent with reference to additional figures. At the lowest level<br>
is the hardware that resides in a device which operates in the frequency band and<br>
drivers associated with the hardware. Thus, the level may be referred to hereinafter<br>
as the hardware/driver level. Examples of these devices (cognitive radio devices)<br>
are referred to above in conjunction with FIG. 1, and an exemplary device<br>
described in more detail in FIGs. 11. There is at least a real-time spectrum<br>
analyzer (SAGE) 20 and a radio receiver or radio transceiver (hereinafter "radio")<br>
12 in the device in order to receive and sample radio frequency energy in the<br>
frequency band. The SAGE 20 may be implemented in hardware or software and<br>
in conjunction with the radio 12, processes signals received by the radio 12<br><br>
operating in either a narrowband mode or a wideband mode. In a wideband mode,<br>
the radio receiver/transceiver 12 may downconvert signals across the entire<br>
frequency band of interest during any given time interval. If the radio<br>
receiver/transceiver 12 is operated in a narrowband mode, then the radio receiver<br>
(or transceiver) may be tuned to different sub-bands across the frequency band to<br>
obtain information for the entire band. Depending upon the particular device, there<br>
may also be a modem 14 that is used to perform baseband signal processing<br>
according to a particular communication standard.<br>
Also at the lowest level there is a set of drivers associated with the SAGE<br>
20, radio transceiver/receiver 12 and the modem 14. The SAGE drivers 15<br>
interface spectrum activity information generated by the SAGE 20 to higher level<br>
processes, and interface controls to the SAGE 20. The spectrum aware drivers 17<br>
respond to manually generated or automatically generated controls in order to<br>
change an operational parameter of a device or network of devices. For example, if<br>
the device is an IEEE 802.11 AP, then a change in an operational parameter may<br>
affect a change in the operation of the AP as well as the STAs that are associated<br>
with that AP. The spectrum aware drivers 17 may be capable of responding to<br>
control signals to change an operational parameter that is not necessarily required<br>
by the rules of a particular communication protocol, and may take the form of a<br>
specially designed lower medium access control (LMAC) layer associated with a<br>
particular communication standard, such as IEEE 802.11, that has necessary<br>
controls points for adjusting those parameters.<br>
The spectrum aware drivers 17 may receive commands from interference<br>
algorithms at a higher level to adjust a transmit rate, fragmentation threshold, etc.<br>
In addition, the spectrum aware drivers 17 may receive commands to perform<br>
dynamic packet scheduling to avoid transmitting a packet that may interfere in time<br>
and frequency with a signal from another device, dynamic packet fragmentation<br>
and encryption of data "on-the-fly". Furthermore, the spectrum aware drivers 17<br>
may receive commands to change a (center frequency) of operation, bandwidth of<br>
operation, data rate, transmit power, etc. The spectrum aware drivers 17 generate<br>
the appropriate control signals to modify any of these operational parameters in the<br>
appropriate hardware or firmware in the radio device.<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 7, the SAGE 20 will be briefly described. The<br>
SAGE is more fully described in commonly assigned co-pending U.S. Application<br>
No. 10/246,365 filed September 18, 2002, entitled "System and Method for Real-<br>
Time Spectrum Analysis in a Communication Device," the entirety of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The SAGE 20 obtains real-time information about the activity in a<br>
frequency band, and may be implemented as a VLSI accelerator, or in software.<br>
The SAGE 20 comprises a spectrum analyzer (SA) 22, a signal detector (SD) 23, a<br>
snapshot buffer (SB) 24 and a universal signal synchronizer (USS) 25.<br>
The SA 22 generates data representing a real-time spectrogram of a<br>
bandwidth of RF spectrum, such as, for example, up to 100 MHz using a Fast <br>
Fourier Transform (FFT) process. As such, the SA 22 may be used to monitor all<br>
activity in a frequency band, such as the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands. As shown in<br>
FIG. 7, the data path leading into the SA 22 comprises of an automatic gain control<br>
block (AGC) block, a windowing block, a NFFT = 256-point complex FFT block,<br>
and a spectrum correction block. The windowing and FFT blocks may support<br>
sampling rates as high as 120 Msps (complex). The windowing block performs<br>
pre-FFT windowing on the I and Q data using either a Harming or rectangular<br>
window. The FFT block provides (I and Q) FFT data for each of 256 frequency<br>
bins that span the bandwidth of frequency band of interest. For each FFT sampling<br>
time interval, the FFT block outputs M (such as 10) bits of data for each FFT<br>
frequency bin, for example, 256 bins. The spectrum correction algorithm corrects<br>
side tone suppression and DC offset.<br>
Internal to the SA 22 are a lowpass filter (LPF), a linear-to-log converter, a<br>
decimator and a statistics block. The LPF performs a unity-gain, single-pole<br>
lowpass filtering operation on the power values of the signal at each FFT<br>
frequency. Using Pfft(k) to denote the power value of signal at FFT frequency f(k),<br>
the lowpass filter output Plpf/(k) is updated once per FFT period as follows:<br>
Plpf(k,t) = Î±, â€¢Plpf(k,t) + (1-Î±l)â€¢Plpf(k,t-1), 1â‰¤kâ‰¤ 256, where a, is a<br>
parameter specifying the LPF bandwidth. The linear-to-log block at the output of<br>
the FFT computes the decibel value PdB(k) = 10*lbg(\Plpf_td(k)\) for each FFT value<br>
PlPf_td(k) (in dBFS, i.e., dB from full-scale on the ADC); the decibel value is<br><br>
subsequently converted to an absolute power level (in dBm) by subtracting the<br>
receiver gain control from the dBFS value. PDB(k) is the data field that<br>
corresponds to the power at a plurality of frequency bins k. The stats block<br>
accumulates and stores the following statistics in the stats buffer of a dual port<br>
RAM (DPR) 28 via a RAM interface I/F 26: duty cycle vs. frequency during a<br>
period of time; average power vs. frequency during a period of time; maximum<br>
(max) power vs. frequency during a period of time; and number of peaks during a<br>
period of time. The stats block gives the basic information about other signals<br>
surrounding a device operating a SAGE 20. Duty cycle is a running count of the<br>
number of times the power at a FFT frequency bin exceeds a power threshold.<br>
Maximum power at a particular FFT frequency bin is tracked over time. The peaks<br>
histogram tracks the number of peaks detected over time intervals.<br>
The stats block has modules to accumulate statistics for power, duty cycle,<br>
maximum power and a peaks histogram. Statistics are accumulated in the DPR<br>
over successive FFT time intervals. After a certain number of FFT intervals,<br>
determined by a configurable value stored in the spectrum analyzer control<br>
registers, an interrupt is generated to the processor so that the processor reads out <br>
the stats from the DPR into its memory. For example, the stats are maintained in<br>
the DPR for 10,000 FFT intervals before the processor reads out the values from<br>
the DPR.<br>
To accumulate (average) power stats, the PDB(k) data field generated is<br>
supplied to the stats block. It may be decimated by an optional decimator. The<br>
status block adds the power at each frequency bin for a previous time interval is<br>
added to the power at that frequency bin for the current time interval. The running<br>
power sum at each frequency bin is output to the DPR 28 as a SumPwr stat, also<br>
called the average power stat.<br>
A duty count stat is generated by comparing the PDB(k) with a power<br>
threshold. Each time the power at a frequency bin exceeds the power threshold, the<br>
previous duty count statistic for that frequency bin is incremented, that corresponds<br>
to the duty count stat (DutyCnt), which again, is a running count of the number of<br>
times the power at a FFT frequency exceeds the power threshold.<br><br>
A maximum power stat (MaxPwr) is tracked at each frequency bin. The<br>
current maximum power value at each frequency k is compared to the new power<br>
value at each frequency k. Either the current power maximum or the new PDB(k)<br>
is output, depending on whether the new PDB(k) exceeds the current power<br>
maximum at the frequency.<br>
The number of peaks that are detected by the peak detector during each FFT<br>
time interval is counted, buffered and stored in a histogram register for output to<br>
the DPR 28.<br>
Each of these statistics is described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
The SD 23 identifies signal pulses in the received signal data, filters these<br>
signals based on their spectral and temporal properties, and passes characteristic<br>
information about each pulse to the dual port RAM (DPR) 28. The SD 23 also<br>
provides pulse timing information to the USS 25 block to allow the USS 25 to<br>
synchronize its clocks to transmissions to/from other devices (for example, to<br>
eliminate interference with QoS-sensitive ULB devices such as cordless phones,<br>
Bluetooth headsets, video-over-802.11 devices, etc.). The SD 23 comprises a peak<br>
detector and several pulse detectors, e.g., 4 pulse detectors. The peak detector<br>
looks for spectral peaks in the FFT data at its input, and reports the bandwidth,<br>
center frequency and power for each detected peak. The output of the peak<br>
detector is one or more peaks and related information. Each pulse detector detects<br>
and characterizes signal pulses based on input from the peak detector.<br>
The peak detector detects a peak as a set of FFT points in contiguous FFT<br>
frequency bins, each above a configured minimum power level. Once per FFT<br>
interval, the peak detector outputs data describing those frequency bins that had a<br>
FFT value above a peak threshold and which frequency bin of a contiguous set of<br>
frequency bins has a maximum value for tliat set. In addition, the peak detector<br>
passes a power vs. frequency bin data field for each FFT interval. This can be<br>
represented by the pseudo code (where k is the frequency bin index):<br><br><br><br>
The peak outputs the bandwidth, center frequency and power for each detected<br>
peak.<br>
A pulse detector calculates relative thresholds based on configuration<br>
information, and checks whether a peak exceeds the relative thresholds. If a peak<br>
exceeds the relative threshold, it defines the peak as a pulse candidate. Once a<br>
pulse candidate is found, the pulse detector compares the identified pulse candidate<br>
with a pulse definition such as ranges for power, center frequency, bandwidth and<br>
duration (defined by the pulse detector configuration information). After matching<br>
a pulse candidate with a defined pulse associated with the configuration<br>
information, the pulse detector declares that a pulse has been detected and outputs<br>
pulse event data (power, center frequency, bandwidth, duration and start time)<br>
associated with the detected pulse.<br>
The SB 24 collects a set of raw digital signal samples of the received signal<br>
useful for signal classification and other purposes, such as time of arrival location<br>
measurements. The SB 24 can be triggered to begin sample collection from either<br>
the SD 23 or from an external trigger source using the snapshot trigger signal<br>
SBTRIG. When a snapshot trigger condition is detected, SB 24 buffers up a set of<br>
digital samples and asserts an interrupt to a processor. The processor may then<br>
perform background-level processing on the samples for the purposes of<br>
identifying or locating another device.<br>
The USS 25 detects and synchronizes to periodic signal sources, such as<br>
frequency hopping signals (e.g., Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO and certain cordless phones).<br>
The USS 25 interfaces with the spectrum aware drivers 17 (FIG. 6) that manage<br>
scheduling of packet transmissions in the frequency band according to a medium<br>
access control (MAC) protocol, such as that provided by, for example, the IEEE<br>
802.11 communication standard. The USS 25 includes one or more clock modules<br><br>
each of which can be configured to track the clock of a signal identified by a pulse<br>
detector in the SD 23.<br>
A processor (not shown) interfaces with the SAGE 20 to receive spectrum<br>
information output by the SAGE 20, and to control certain operational parameters<br>
of the SAGE 20. The processor may be any suitable microprocessor that resides<br>
either on the same semiconductor chip as the SAGE 20, or on another chip. The<br>
processor interfaces with the SAGE 20 through the DPR 28 and the control<br>
registers 27.<br>
The control registers 27 include registers to enable a processor to<br>
configure, control and monitor the SAGE 20. There is a control/status register, an<br>
interrupt enable register, an interrupt flags register, spectrum analyzer control<br>
registers, signal detector control registers, snapshot buffer control registers and<br>
USS control registers.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 6, at the next higher level, there is a measurement<br>
engine 50, a classification engine 52, a location engine 54 and a spectrum expert<br>
56. These processes may be executed by software. The spectrum activity<br>
information used by any of the processes 50, 52 and 54 may be sourced from a<br>
communication device operating in the frequency band and/or from one or more<br>
spectrum sensors (FIG. 1) positioned in various locations of a region of interest,<br>
such as around the periphery and at other locations of an business or other facility.<br>
Moreover, the measurement engine 50, classification engine 52 and spectrum<br>
expert 56 may be performed locally in a device that operates in the radio frequency<br>
band, such as an AP, or remotely in a server computer, such as the server 1055 or<br>
network management station 1090 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The measurement engine 50 collects and aggregates output from the SAGE<br>
20 and normalizes the data into meaningful data units for further processing.<br>
Specifically, the measurement engine 50 accumulates statistics for time intervals of<br>
output data from the SAGE 20 to track, with respect to each of a plurality of<br>
frequency bins that span the frequency band, average power, maximum power and<br>
duty cycle as well as other statistics described hereinafter. In addition, the<br>
measurement engine 50 accumulates pulse event data for signal pulses output by<br>
the SAGE that fit the configured criteria. Each pulse event may include data for<br><br>
power level, center frequency, bandwidth, start time, duration and termination time.<br>
The measurement engine 50 may build histograms of signal pulse data that are<br>
useful for signal classification, examples of which are described hereinafter.<br>
Finally, the measurement engine 50 accumulates raw received signal data (from the<br>
snapshot buffer of the SAGE 20) useful for location measurement in response to<br>
commands from higher levels in the architecture. The measurement engine 50 may<br>
maintain short-term storage of spectrum activity information. Furthermore, the<br>
measurement engine 50 may aggregate statistics related to performance of a<br>
wireless network operating in the radio frequency band, such as an IEEE 802.11<br>
WLAN. Exemplary output of the measurement engine 50 is described hereinafter<br>
in conjunction with the network spectrum interface. Examples of graphical<br>
displays of the output of the measurement engine 50 are shown in FlGs. 21-25.<br>
Moreover, a higher level application may respond to a user command (through a<br>
suitable user interface) to monitor data and statistics of the measurement engine to<br>
determine whether there is a performance degradation of a device or network of<br>
devices. Certain actions can be recommended or automatically taken based on a<br>
determine cause of the performance degradation.<br>
In response to requests from other software programs or systems (such as<br>
the network spectrum interface described hereinafter, the classification engine 52<br>
or the location engine 54), the measurement engine 50 responds to configure the<br>
SAGE 20 (through the SAGE drivers 15) and or radio 12, according to the type of<br>
data requested, runs SAGE 20 with those configurations, and responds with one or<br>
more of several types of data generated by processing the data output by the SAGE<br>
20.<br>
The classification engine 52 compares outputs of the SAGE 20<br>
(accumulated by the measurement engine 50) against data templates and related<br>
information of known signals in order to classify signals in the frequency based on<br>
energy pulse information detected by the SAGE. The classification engine 52 can<br>
detect, for example, signals that interfere with the operation of one or more devices<br>
(e.g., occupy or occur in the same channel of the unlicensed band as a device<br>
operating in the band). The output of the classification engine 52 includes types of<br>
signals detected in the frequency band. A classification output may be, for<br><br>
example, "cordless phone", "frequency hopper device", "frequency hopper cordless<br>
phone", "microwave oven", "802.11x WLAN device", etc. The classification<br>
engine 52 may compare signal data supplied to it by the measurement engine<br>
against a database of information of known signals or signal types. The signal<br>
classification database may be updated with the reference data for new devices that<br>
use the frequency band. In addition, the classification engine 52 may output<br>
information describing one or more of the center frequency, bandwidth, power,<br>
pulse duration, etc. of the classified signal, which is easily obtained directly from<br>
the signal detector output of the SAGE. This may particularly useful for a<br>
classified signal that is determined to interfere with operation of other devices in<br>
the frequency band.<br>
Examples of signal classification techniques are described in commonly<br>
assigned co-pending U.S. Application No. 10/246,364, filed September 18, 2002,<br>
entitled "System and Method for Signal Classification of Signals in a Frequency<br>
Band," the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. These signal<br>
classification techniques that may be used are based on pulse histograms, pulse<br>
time signatures and other custom algorithms, examples of which are described in<br>
the aforementioned pending patent application, and are briefly described in<br>
conjunction with FIGs. 8 and 9. It should be understood that other signal<br>
classification techniques may be known in the art.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates exemplary signal pulses of signals that may be present in<br>
the frequency band. There is IEEE 802.1 lb signal activity that consists of pulses 1-<br>
6. Pulses 1, 3 and 5 are the forward channel 802.1 lb transmissions and pulses 2, 4<br>
and 6 are acknowledgement signals. There is also a frequency hopping signal, such<br>
as a Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO signal comprising pulses 7-14. The timing, strength and<br>
duration of the signals are not shown at precise scale. Pulse event data is generated<br>
for signal pulses 1-6, for example, by a pulse detector configured appropriately.<br>
Pulse event information is generated for signal pulses 7-14 by another pulse<br>
detector configured appropriately. The signal pulse data is accumulated over time<br>
for the two types of signals. The signal pulse data may be accumulated into various<br>
histograms. In addition, spectrum analysis information may be derived from the<br>
signal activity in the frequency band, and this information can be used to generate,<br><br>
for example, the number of different transmissions that appear to be present in the<br>
frequency band at a given time period by counting the number of power values<br>
(above a threshold) at different frequencies in the band during the same time<br>
interval.<br>
Examples of the pulse event data that is generated for exemplary pulses<br>
shown in FIG. 8 are provided below.<br><br><br><br>
Though not listed above, also included in the information for each pulse is<br>
the start time of a pulse, thereby enabling computation of the time between<br>
consecutive pulses detected by a pulse detector.<br>
The pulse event data for pulses 7-14 are very similar, with the exception of<br>
the center frequency. For example, pulses 7-14 may have a pulse bandwidth of 1<br>
MHz, a pulse duration of 350 microsec, whereas the center frequency will vary<br>
across nearly all of the 2400 MHz to 2483 MHz frequency band. The SDID for<br>
pulses 7-14 is 2, since pulse detector 2 is configured to detect these types of pulses,<br>
for example.<br>
FIG. 9 generally illustrates how accumulated signal pulse data is compared<br>
against reference data. The accumulated signal pulse data for the signals to be<br>
classified are compared against reference or profile signal pulse data for known<br>
signals. Each histogram of the accumulated signal pulse data is compared against<br>
a like-kind histogram of the reference signal pulse data. The degree of match<br>
between the accumulated signal pulse data and the reference signal pulse data may<br>
be adjustable and for certain reference signal pulses, a very close match on certain<br>
pulse data must be found, as compared to other signal pulse data. To this end, each<br>
reference data set may have its own match criteria that must be satisfied in order to<br>
ultimately declare a match. For example, when comparing accumulated signal<br>
pulse data with reference data for a Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO signal, there must be very<br>
precise matches between the pulse duration, bandwidth and time between pulses<br><br>
histograms in order to declare a match. A scoring system may be used, where a<br>
numeric value is assigned to the comparison results between each signal<br>
characteristic. For certain signal types, if the total numeric value (e.g., total score)<br>
is at least as great as a certain value, then a match may be declared. An additional<br>
constraint may also require that certain signal characteristics must have a minimum<br>
degree of match.<br>
The reference data for the variety of signals that may use the frequency<br>
band may be obtained from actual measurement and analysis of those devices,<br>
and/or from a database of information provided by a regulatory authority, such as a<br>
Federal Communication Commission in the U.S. The FCC may maintain and<br>
make publicly available a database of transmission parameters for each device<br>
permitted to operate in the frequency band. Examples of such parameters are:<br>
Frequency range of operation<br>
Spectrum channelization (bandwidth) and characterization:<br>
Frequency-hopping: hop rate and hop center frequencies<br>
Stationary channel: channel center frequencies<br>
Symbol rates<br>
Modulation modes (e.g., QPSK, OFDM, QAM,...)<br>
Transmit spectrum masks<br>
Transmit power levels<br>
Transmit on/off time characterizations<br>
Minimum and maximum "on" times<br>
Minimum and maximum "off times<br>
Slot times, if appropriate, between channel accesses<br>
The comparison step may involve comparing pulse timing signatures of<br>
known signals against the accumulated signal pulse data (typically over relatively<br>
short periods of time) to determine if there is a match within certain predetermined<br>
and adjustable tolerances. The visual paradigm is as if sliding a pulse timing<br>
template of a known signal along the accumulated pulse data of an unknown signal<br>
to determine if there is a sufficient match. Pulse timing signatures can provide a<br>
distinctive representation of a device or class of devices. They are useful to<br>
classify signals that have very rigorous timing attributes.<br><br>
The accumulated pulse data for a particular pulse may suggest that it is of a<br>
particular type, but it is not necessarily determinative. For example, suggestive<br>
characteristics of an 802.11 signal is the presence of a signal pulse with a very short<br>
duration, no more than 200 microsec and a time between pulses of no more than 20<br>
microsec. However, the additional data (center frequency and bandwidth) is not<br>
sufficient to confirm that it is an 802.11 signal. Therefore, pulse timing signature<br>
analysis (i.e., pattern) is performed on the pulse data. For example, the pulse<br>
timing analysis for an 802.11 signal is focused on identifying two signal pulses on<br>
the same center frequency separated from each other by no more than 20 microsec,<br>
and where the second signal pulse (an 802.11 ACK pulse) is no more than 200<br>
microsec. The duration of the first pulse for an 802.11 signal is not particularly<br>
relevant to this analysis.<br>
A similar analysis may be performed on the pulse data against pulse<br>
signature information for a Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO signal in which activity consists of<br>
two bursts of energy (pulses) very close in time. Energy associated with a first<br>
pulse may occur at one frequency in the band, and energy associated with a second<br>
pulse may occur at another frequency in the band, separated from the first pulse by<br>
a time interval that recurs on a consistent-basis. In fact, the Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO<br>
signal is representative of many unlicensed band devices that employ a frequency<br>
hopping sequence and involve a transmission by a first device (e.g., a "master")<br>
followed a precise period of time later by a transmission by a second device (e.g., a<br>
"slave"). The time period between the leading edge or trailing edge of the first<br>
pulse and the leading edge of the second pulse is commonly very consistent. Both<br>
pulses may be relatively short in duration. In addition, the time period between the<br>
leading edge of the second pulse and the leading edge of the next first pulse may be<br>
very consistent. A Bluetoothâ„¢ ACL transmission is quasi-periodic in the sense<br>
that sometimes it looks periodic and has timing signatures similar to Bluetoothâ„¢<br>
SCO transmissions, and sometimes it does not.<br>
The pulse timing signature analysis for a frequency hopping signal is<br>
slightly different if the spectrum information is derived from sampling of only a<br>
portion of the frequency band, rather than the entire band that the signal may hop<br>
in. For example, while a frequency hopping signal is just as likely to occur<br><br>
anywhere in a frequency band, such as the 2.4 GHz band, if data for only a 20 MHz<br>
portion of the band were provided as input to the classification process, then the<br>
signal pulse data would show a relatively smaller percentage of pulses from the<br>
frequency hopping signal. The pulse timing signature analysis would be adjusted<br>
accordingly.<br>
Classifying a signal using pulse timing signature analysis is particularly<br>
useful when more than one device is transmitting in the frequency band. Pulse<br>
timing signature information for a signal can be represented by data describing the<br>
characteristics of a pulse, such as pulse duration, time between pulses, etc. This<br>
information can then compared against similar pulse timing signature information<br>
to determine whether there is a match.<br>
Both the measurement engine 50 and the classification engine 52 may<br>
generate spectrum events that are reported to higher level software programs or<br>
systems. For example, based on an analysis of the spectrum activity information<br>
generated by the SAGE 20, reports can be made on specific types of events, such as<br>
a Bluetoothâ„¢ device being turned on or off in the frequency band, or a cordless<br>
telephone going active. These spectrum events are described further hereinafter.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 6, the location engine 54 computes the physical<br>
location of devices operating in the frequency band. One example of a location<br>
measurement technique involves using snapshot buffer data collected by the<br>
measurement engine 50 to perform time difference of arrival (TDOA)<br>
measurements at two or more known locations (such as at two or more STAs) of a<br>
signal transmitted by the device to be located and another reference signal (such as<br>
an AP) to determine a location of a variety of devices (such as interferers)<br>
operating in the region of the frequency band. Sometimes simply moving an<br>
interferer to a different location can resolve transmission problems that another<br>
device or network of devices may be experiencing. The location engine 54 may<br>
coordinate measurements obtained from multiple locations in the network. An<br>
example of a location engine is disclosed in commonly assigned co-pending U.S.<br>
Application No. 60/319,737, filed November 27, 2002, entitled "System and<br>
Method for Locating Wireless Devices in an Unsynchronized Wireless Network,"<br>
the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Numerous other<br><br>
techniques to determine the location of wireless radio communication devices using<br>
TDOA and time of arrival (TOA) measurements are known in the art and may be<br>
used as well for the location engine.<br>
The location engine 54 may alternatively reside in software "above" the<br>
network spectrum interface (NSI) 70. When an interference condition in the<br>
frequency band is detected, the spectrum expert 56 or network expert 80 may<br>
command the location engine 54 to physically locate the source of the interferes<br>
The output of the location engine 54 may include position information, power<br>
level, device type and/or device (MAC) address. The security services 82 may<br>
command the location engine 54 to locate a rogue device that may present a<br>
possible security problem.<br>
The spectrum expert 56 is a process that optimizes operation of devices<br>
operating in the frequency band, given knowledge about the activity in the<br>
frequency band obtained by the measurement and classification engines. For<br>
example, the spectrum expert 56 processes data from the SAGE 20 and optionally<br>
statistics from a particular wireless network operating in the frequency band, such<br>
as an IEEE 802.11x network, in order to make recommendations to adjust<br>
parameters of a device, or to automatically perform those adjustments in a device.<br>
The spectrum expert 56 may be a software program that is executed, for example,<br>
by a host device coupled to an AP, a server or a network management station (FIG.<br>
1). Parameters that can be adjusted (manually or automatically) based on output of<br>
the spectrum expert 56 include frequency channel, transmit power, fragmentation<br>
threshold, RTS/CTS, transmit data rate, CCA threshold, interference avoidance,<br>
etc. Other examples of interference mitigation techniques are described in<br>
commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. Application No. 10/248,434, filed<br>
January 20, 2003, and entitled "Systems and Methods for Interference Mitigation<br>
with Respect to Periodic Interferers in Short-Range Wireless Applications," the<br>
entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. The spectrum expert 56 may<br>
operate on triggers for alert conditions in the frequency band, such as detection of a<br>
signal that interferes with the operation of a device or network of devices operating<br>
in the frequency band, to automatically report an alert, and/or adjust a parameter in<br><br>
a device in response thereto. For example, the spectrum expert 56 may operate to<br>
control or suggest controls for a single WLAN AP.<br>
The spectrum expert 56 is the spectrum intelligence decision maker. The<br>
spectrum expert 56 (and/or network expert described hereinafter) may determine<br>
what alerts and/or controls are generated based on spectrum policy information.<br>
Spectrum policy information is a body of information that, based on conditions<br>
determined to be occurring in the frequency band, defines corresponding alerts<br>
and/or controls. This body of information may be updateable to account for new<br>
devices that operate in the frequency band and/or changing regulations concerning<br>
requirements for the frequency band. Moreover, the spectrum expert 56 can<br>
decide to act, and how to act, or decide not act. For example, the spectrum expert<br>
may make a decision either to interfere with another signal or not to interfere.<br>
Examples of how the spectrum policies may be applied are described hereinafter.<br>
The spectrum expert 56 may use the spectrum activity information to<br>
intelligently control IEEE 802.11 WLAN parameters in an AP:<br>
1.	Measuring received signal quality together with information about<br>
an interfering signal may call for adjusting a transmit data rate of the AP and/or<br>
STAs.<br>
2.	Tracking packet errors and SAGE pulse data may call for adjusting<br>
a fragmentation threshold.<br>
3.	Detecting in packet sequence statistics indicating a hidden node may<br>
call for executing an RTS/CTS sequence. The RTS/CTS sequence is used as a<br>
"delivery confirmation system" and is turned off when possible, in low noise<br>
environments, since it slows transmissions, but it can be activated when necessary,<br>
such as to find a STA.<br>
4.	Using SAGE spectrum analysis data, an AP may be controlled to<br>
select a new cleaner channel.<br>
5.	Using SAGE related data and signal classification data indicating an<br>
interferer may call for adjusting the transmit power of an AP.<br>
6.	Executing an action dependent on the particular device type or even<br>
brand and device model identified (through snapshot buffer and other spectrum<br>
data).<br><br>
Generally, the spectrum expert 56 may be executed in a radio device that<br>
controls itself of controls the behavior of several other radio devices associated<br>
with it (as is the case with an AP). These types of decisions and controls are<br>
referred to as local policy decisions or controls in that they affect a device or a<br>
particular limited group of devices. The network expert 80, described hereinafter,<br>
makes broader type policy decisions and controls such as those that affect an entire<br>
network of devices (e.g., multiple APs and their associated STAs in WLAN).<br>
A sensor overlay network comprised of one or more spectrum sensors<br>
1200(1) to 1200(N) may generated spectrum activity information that is supplied to<br>
a server that controls a device in the frequency band. For example, signal detection<br>
is performed at the sensor level, and measurement and accumulation may be<br>
performed either at the sensor level or at the AP's host processor. The spectrum<br>
expert 56 is executed on the host processor of the host device that is connected to<br>
an AP and used to control that AP. Signal detection is performed at the sensor<br>
level, and measurement and accumulation may be performed either at the sensor<br>
level or at the AP's host processor.<br>
The abstract level where the measurement engine 50, classification engine<br>
52 and spectrum expert 56 reside may be referred to hereinafter as a "spectrum" or<br>
"spectrum aware" level.<br>
The NSI 70 shown in FIG. 6 interfaces the measurement engine 50,<br>
classification engine 52, location engine 54 and spectrum expert 56 processes (and<br>
the lower level drivers) to higher level services. The NSI 70 serves as an<br>
application programming interface (API) that can be implemented by application<br>
programs (on one or more computer readable media) to access the spectrum<br>
analysis functions of these processes. End user on-demand commands to check the<br>
spectrum knowledge or activity information at a particular device may be received<br>
from an application program and the NSI translates the commands into a request<br>
for a particular spectrum analysis function from one of the processes. It is also<br>
possible that there may be interaction between and among the measurement engine<br>
50, classification engine 52, location engine 54 and spectrum expert 56 using an<br>
interface similar to the NSI 70. Moreover, the physical location of the blocks in<br>
FIG. 6 is not meant to limit the possible logical arrangement of these functions,<br><br>
applications or processes. For example, NSI may be used to interface any one or<br>
more of the blocks shown in FIG. 6 with the spectrum analysis functions of the<br>
measurement engine, classification engine and/or spectrum expert. Moreover, a<br>
less formal interface or connection may exist between any two processes shown in<br>
FIG. 6.<br>
The abstract level just above the NSI 70 may be referred to as a "network"<br>
level. At the network level, there may be a variety of services. For example, there<br>
are a network expert 80, a security service 82, location services 86 and data mining<br>
services 88. The software sitting above the NSI, though identified and described<br>
separately hereinafter, can also be referred to collectively and generically as<br>
network management software (NMS) which may be executed by the network<br>
management station 1090 (FIG. 1), for example.<br>
The network expert 80 is similar to the spectrum expert 56, but it operates<br>
at a higher level, such as across multiple WLAN APs, such as APs 1050(1) to<br>
1050(N) and each of their associated STAs as shown in FIG. 1. The network<br>
expert 80 optimizes networks based on deployment cost, capacity and QoS. The<br>
network expert 80 may make suggestions to a network administrator, or<br>
automatically adjust parameters in one or more wireless networks. For example,<br>
the network expert 80 may control or suggest parameters for: placement of an AP<br>
and of an AP's antennas, AP channel assignments, load balancing of STAs across<br>
APs (reassign a STA to a different AP based on network loading conditions),<br>
transmit power and RTS/CTS parameters. In addition, the network expert may<br>
notify a network administrator or network management application about<br>
interference detected anywhere in the network. The network expert 80 may<br>
optimize coverage for devices in wireless networks by assigning a STA to the AP<br>
that would offer the best throughput and reliable communication link. The<br>
spectrum activity information processed by the network expert may be sourced<br>
from an AP operating in the frequency band or from one and/or more spectrum<br>
sensors positioned in various locations of a region of interest, such as around the<br>
periphery and at other locations of a business enterprise or other facility. The<br>
network expert 80 may also have triggers to generate alerts if a particular condition<br>
is detected. A WLAN AP that has spectrum monitoring capabilities (as well as<br><br>
control capabilities) can add to its spectrum knowledge any spectrum information<br>
supplied to it by any WLAN STA associated with it- The network expert 80,<br>
however, may have an even more global view of the spectrum activity of the entire<br>
region of unlicensed band operation, which may include multiple wireless networks<br>
of the same or different varieties (e.g., IEEE 802.11 WLAN, WPAN, Bluetoothâ„¢,<br>
etc.) Conversely, a WLAN AP may advise its associated STAs about the spectrum<br>
situation that the AP monitors.<br>
The network expert 80 may use spectrum measurement data to optimize<br>
802.11 protocol functions, such as channel scanning in which SAGE 20 analyzes<br>
data for an entire band to output information to enable the classification engine 52<br>
to identify what is present in other channels; channel selection/load balancing in<br>
which SAGE 20 gathers full-band statistics on channel utilization. The benefits of<br>
these techniques are faster channel acquisition, faster channel hand-off, and STA-<br>
based load balancing.<br>
The network expert 80 operates on spectrum activity information obtained<br>
across a broader expanse, such as network-wide. One way to obtain this<br>
information is through multiple cognitively-enabled APs each connected to the<br>
server where the network expert 80 is executed. Alternatively, or in addition, a<br>
sensor overlay network comprised of one or more spectrum sensors 1200(1) to<br>
1200(N) is deployed across the entire network or regions of interest. The network<br>
expert 80 is executed on a server that is connected to the sensors and controls or is<br>
coupled to control the APs, such as through a WLAN management application.<br>
Signal detection is performed at the sensor level, and measurement and<br>
classification may be performed either at the sensor level or at the server.<br>
The network expert 80 may interface with a general network management<br>
system, such as one supported by the network management station 1090 shown in<br>
FIG. 1. A general network management system may control enabling, disabling,<br>
and configuring of network components such as APs. The systems integration<br>
block 90 (described hereinafter) may interface the network expert 80 with a general<br>
network management system to permit notification to the network expert 80 of<br>
changes by the general network management system and to notify the general<br><br>
network management system of changes within the wireless network(s) such as<br>
channel assignments and STA associations.<br>
Thus, the network expert 80 makes the broader type policy decisions and<br>
controls. In addition, the network expert 80 may act as a higher level control of<br>
multiple instances of spectrum experts 56 each associated with a device that is part<br>
of a larger network or regional deployment of devices. This paradigm is shown in<br>
FIG. 28 which is described hereinafter. In so doing, the network expert 80 must<br>
take into account the local policy decisions and controls made by the spectrum<br>
experts 56 under its purview. The network expert 80 will store and maintain<br>
knowledge about the local policy decisions and controls made by its spectrum<br>
experts 56. The network expert 80 may make regional-wide policy decisions or<br>
controls or network-wide policy decisions or controls. Regional-wide decisions are<br>
with respect to activity occurring in a particular "region" or locale controlled, for<br>
example, by some but not all spectrum experts 56 under the network expert's<br>
purview. Network-wide decisions are with respect to activity occurring in an entire<br>
network across all regions or locales where the network exists. When making<br>
regional or network-wide decisions, the network expert 80 may make them so that<br>
they do not interfere with local policy decisions or controls made by the spectrum<br>
experts 56, or may make certain decisions that preempt certain local decisions. For<br>
example, a particular AP under control of the network expert may be experiencing<br>
occasional interference on a particular frequency channel at a certain time of day,<br>
and as such, is adjusted (such as by a spectrum expert 56) to move to another<br>
channel during that time of day. The network expert 80 may, based on other<br>
information, decide to move that particular AP to that particular channel on a more<br>
permanent basis. This would conflict with the APs occasional need to stay away<br>
from that channel at certain times of the day. The network expert 80 will therefore<br>
modification its decision to move that AP to that channel in order to respect the<br>
local policy at the AP. When taking into account the local policy decisions, the<br>
network expert 80 may modify its decisions to avoid network or regional<br>
behavioral "oscillations."<br>
The security services 82 provides security information based on the<br>
spectrum activity and related information generated at the lower level. For<br><br>
example, the security services 82 may detect when there is a denial of service<br>
attack on one more devices or networks operating in the frequency band, detect a<br>
"parking lot" attack, locate a rogue device, such as an unauthorized AP, and<br>
perform RF fingerprinting to determine if there is a device masquerading as an<br>
authorized device (e.g., station or AP).<br>
A denial of service attack may be detected by examining the spectrum<br>
activity information to look for a large bandwidth noise signal that may interfere<br>
with one or more signals in the frequency band. If the noise signal continues for a<br>
significant period of time, the security services may declare a denial of service<br>
attack is being made on one or more wireless networks operating in the frequency<br>
band. An alert or report can be generated to inform a network administrator of the<br>
situation and describe the circumstances of the attack (approximate location of the<br>
source, power level, frequency bandwidth, time of occurrence, etc.).<br>
A parking lot attack is when a user of a wireless network device receives<br>
and/or transmits signals on a wireless network without authority, such as by placing<br>
a wireless device in proximity to an operating network sufficient to receive and/or<br>
transmit signals on the network, assuming that it can get past encryption obstacles<br>
or encryption is not enabled on the network. If the user of the device is merely<br>
listening to signals transmitted, there may be no way to detect it. However, if a<br>
physical boundary (in two or three dimensions) can be made around the AP(s) that<br>
serve the network, then using the location engine 54, it can be determined from<br>
transmissions of the device whether the device is outside the physical boundary,<br>
indicative of an unauthorized device that could attempt to access information stored<br>
on a server of the wired network connected to the AP(s).<br>
An unauthorized device (e.g., AP) may be detected by examining<br>
transmissions of the device and from information contained in the transmission that<br>
it uses (such as an IEEE 802.11 service set identifier (SSID)), it can be determined<br>
whether that SSID is valid against a stored set of valid SSIDs. If an AP is<br>
operating in the frequency band with an invalid SSID, then the security services 82<br>
may command the location engine 54 to determine the location of the AP.<br>
The security services 82 may generate real-time alerts to a network<br>
administrator if a security related breach is detected on one or more wireless<br><br>
networks or devices operating in the frequency band. In the case of detecting a<br>
potential parking lot attack, a procedure may set up to require the user of the out-<br>
of-boundary device (or the device itself) to supply a security code that the AP uses<br>
to validate it as an authorized device. A device that cannot supply this code is<br>
deemed to be an unauthorized device and service to that device is terminated. An<br>
alert may also be generated to advise a network administrator to investigate that<br>
user further.<br>
Another way to manage security in a wireless network is to store the RF<br>
signatures of each authorized device, such as each authorized STA or AP. The RF<br>
signature may be created by capturing detailed signal pulse characteristics of each<br>
authorized device obtained using a device having a SAGE functionality, and<br>
storing information describing those characteristics in a database. Each time a STA<br>
associates with an AP, its signal pulse characteristics may be compared against the<br>
database of information to determine whether it is an authorized device. This<br>
procedure protects against a user of a STA from obtaining a valid MAC address (by<br>
listening to transmissions in a WLAN), and masquerading as that STA using that<br>
MAC address. Even though the MAC address will be valid, the RF fingerprint of<br>
the fraudulent device will likely not match the stored RF fingerprints of the<br>
authorized device in the database.<br>
The location services 86 provide value added services to the location<br>
measurements made by the location engine 54. Examples of these services are<br>
coverage maps, an example of which is shown in FIG. 10, fast hand-offs for voice<br>
over IP devices, finding the closest printer to a device, finding a lost device, and<br>
performing emergency location (E911). As another example, the location services<br>
86 may process spectrum information from multiple points or nodes (multiple<br>
spectrum maps) in a region of unlicensed band operation (e.g., an enterprise) and<br>
assemble the information into an easy to understand format.<br>
The data mining services 88 involves capturing spectrum activity<br>
information (and optionally output from the spectrum expert) for long-term storage<br>
in a database. By analyzing the spectrum activity information in non-real-time<br>
using queries, network administrators can determine various situations such as at<br><br>
what time of day interference is a problem, in what areas of a region of operation is<br>
there the heaviest loading of the spectrum, etc.<br>
Sitting above the network level are a system integration block 90 and a user<br>
interface (UI) block 92. The system integration block 90 interfaces data from any<br>
of the services below to other applications, protocols, software tools or systems,<br>
generally referred to as the network management application(s) 94. For example,<br>
the system integration block 90 may convert information to an SNMP format. The<br>
functions performed by the system integration block 90 are dictated by the<br>
particular application, protocol, system or software tool that it is desired to operate<br>
with the services below. The network management application 94 may be<br>
executed by the network management station 1090 (FIG. 1) to manage wired and<br>
wireless networks. The UI 92 may provide graphical, audio or video type interface<br>
of information generated by any of the services below for human consumption.<br>
Examples of graphical user interfaces for spectrum activity information and alerts<br>
are shown in FIGs. 16-25, described hereinafter. These higher level processes can<br>
be executed on computer equipment remote from the site where the radio frequency<br>
band activity is occurring. For example, the network management application 94<br>
may be executed by the network management station 1090 that is located in a<br>
central monitoring or control center (telephone service provider, cable Internet<br>
service provider, etc.) coupled to the sensor devices, APs, etc., as well as the<br>
devices which it controls (e.g., APs) via a wide area network (WAN) connection,,<br>
e.g., the Internet, a dedicated high speed wired connection, or other longer distance<br>
wired or wireless connection.<br>
Any device that receives radio frequency energy in the frequency band of<br>
interest may be equipped with a SAGE 20 to generate spectrum activity<br>
information. FIG. 11 shows an example of such a cognitive radio device. The<br>
communication device includes the radio 12 that downconverts received radio<br>
frequency energy and upconverts signals for transmission. The radio 12 may be a<br>
narrowband radio or radio capable of wideband operation and narrowband<br>
operation. An example of a wideband radio transceiver is disclosed in commonly<br>
assigned and co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/374,531, entitled<br>
"System and Architecture for Wireless Transceiver Employing Composite<br><br>
Beamforming and Spectrum Management Techniques," filed April 22, 2002 and in<br>
commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. Application No. 10/065,388, filed<br>
October 11, 2002, entitled "Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Radio Transceiver." A<br>
baseband section (that may include or correspond to the modem shown in FIG. 6)<br>
14 is coupled to the radio 12 and performs digital baseband processing of signals.<br>
One or more analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) 18 convert the analog baseband<br>
signals output by the radio 12 to digital signals. Similarly, one or more digital-to-<br>
analog converters (DACs) 16 convert digital signals generated by the baseband<br>
section 14 for upconversion by the radio 12. The SAGE 20, referred to in FIG. 6,<br>
is shown as receiving input from the ADCs 18.<br>
A processor 30 may be provided that is coupled to the baseband section 14<br>
and to the SAGE 20. The processor 30 executes instructions stored in memory 32<br>
to perform several of the software spectrum management functions that are<br>
described herein as being "on-chip" or "embedded" software functions. Thus,<br>
some of the software stored in memory 32 is referred to herein as on-chip or<br>
embedded software. Examples of the on-chip or embedded software functions are<br>
the SAGE drivers 15, the spectrum aware drivers 17 and the measurement engine<br>
50, although additional processes shown in FIG. 6 such as the classification engine<br>
52, location engine 54 and spectrum expert 56, could be performed by the<br>
processor 30. The phantom line shown in FIG. 11 is meant to indicate that several<br>
or all of those elements surrounded thereby may be fabricated into a single digital<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The processor 30 may also perform<br>
MAC processing associated with a communication protocol. The larger block<br>
around the radio and the other components is meant to indicate that these elements<br>
may be implemented in a network interface card (NIC) form factor. The processor<br>
30 may have the ability to generate traffic statistics related to a particular<br>
communication protocol that the device uses. Examples of IEEE 802.11 traffic<br>
statistics are described hereinafter.<br>
A host processor 40 may be provided that is coupled to the processor 30<br>
by a suitable interface 34. The host processor 40 may be part of a host device, such<br>
as a personal computer (PC), server 1055 or network management station 1090<br>
(FIG. 1). Memory 42 stores hosted or "off-chip" software to perform higher level<br><br>
spectrum management functions. Examples of the processes that the host processor<br>
40 may perform include the measurement engine 50, classification engine 52,<br>
location engine 54 and spectrum expert 56. In addition, the host processor 40 may<br>
perform still higher level processes, such as the network expert 80, as well as lower<br>
level processes.<br>
The communication device shown in FIG. 11 may be part of, or correspond<br>
to, any of a variety of devices that operate in the frequency band, such as an IEEE<br>
802.11 WLAN AP or ST A. The communication device may share information<br>
with a computer that may be remote from it, such as the server 1055 or network<br>
management station 1090 shown in FIG. 1. The remote computer may have<br>
wireless communication capability (or is linked by wire through another device that<br>
has wireless communication capability with the communication devices). Software<br>
to execute the system integration block 90 and UI 92 (FIG. 6) may be executed by<br>
the host processor 40 or by the remote computer, e.g., the server 1055 or remote<br>
network management station 1090.<br>
A cognitive radio device such as the one shown in FIG. 11 can detect,<br>
measure, classify activity occurring in the frequency band, and through a<br>
functionality such as the spectrum expert 56, can-make intelligent decisions about<br>
whether or not to change any one of its operating parameters, such as frequency of<br>
operation, transmit power, data rate, packet size, timing of transmission (to avoid<br>
other signals), etc. Moreover, a radio device may respond to controls generated on<br>
the basis of information generated by another radio device that detects, measures<br>
and classifies activity in the frequency band.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of a spectrum sensor (e.g.,<br>
spectrum sensor 1200(1) to 1200(N) referred to above in conjunction with FIG. 4).<br>
The spectrum sensor is a radio device that receives signals in the frequency band of<br>
interest. In this sense, the spectrum sensor is a spectrum monitor of a sort, and may<br>
also detect, measure and classify to provide spectrum intelligence that is supplied<br>
to other radio devices, network control applications, etc., that can control the<br>
operation of an entire network of devices. The spectrum sensor comprises at least<br>
one radio receiver capable of downconverting signals in the frequency band of<br>
interest, either in a wideband mode or scanning narrowband mode. It is possible,<br><br>
as shown in FIG. 12, that the spectrum sensor comprises two radio receivers 4000<br>
and 4010 (dedicated to different unlicensed bands) or a single dual band radio<br>
receiver. There is an ADC 18 that converts the output of the radio receiver to<br>
digital signals, which is then coupled to the SAGE 20 or other device capable of<br>
generating signal pulse data and spectrum. A DAC 16 may be useful to supply<br>
control signals to the radio receiver via a switch 4020.<br>
An interface 4030, such as a Cardbus, universal serial bus (USB), mini-PCI,<br>
etc., interfaces the output of the SAGE 20 and other components to a host device<br>
3000. There are an optional embedded processor 4040 to perform local processing<br>
(such as the measurement engine 50, classification engine 52, location engine 54<br>
and spectrum expert 56 shown in FIG. 6), an Ethernet block 4050 to interface to a<br>
wired network, FLASH memory 4060 and SDRAM 4070. There are also an<br>
optional lower MAC (LMAC) logic block 4080 associated with a particular<br>
communication protocol or standard ("protocol X") and a modem 4090 associated<br>
with protocol X. Protocol X may be any communication protocol that operates in<br>
the frequency band, such as an IEEE 802.1 lx protocol. Multiple protocols may be<br>
supported by the device. Many of the blocks may be integrated into a digital logic<br>
gate array ASIC. The LMAC logic 4080 and modem 4090 may be used to track<br>
communication traffic on protocol X and generate traffic statistics. The larger<br>
block around the radio(s) and other components is meant to indicate that the<br>
spectrum sensor device may be implemented in a NIC form factor for PCI PC-card<br>
or mini-PCI deployment. Alternatively, many of these components, save the<br>
embedded processor, may be implemented directly on a processor/CPU<br>
motherboard.<br>
The host device 3000 may be a computer having a processor 3002 and<br>
memory 3004 to process the spectrum activity information supplied by the<br>
spectrum sensor via a wired network connection, USB connection, or even a<br>
wireless connection (such as an 802.1 lx wireless network connection). A display<br>
monitor 3010 maybe coupled to the host device 3000. The memory 3004 in the<br>
host device may store the software programs that correspond to the aforementioned<br>
embedded software and/or the hosted software (for the processes shown in FIG. 6).<br>
In addition, the memory 3004 may store driver software for the host device, such as<br><br>
drivers for operating systems such as Windows operating systems (WindowsÂ® XP,<br>
WindowsÂ® CE, etc.). The host device 3000 may be a desktop or notebook<br>
personal computer or personal digital assistant, or a computer device local to or<br>
remote from the spectrum sensor, or the server 1055 or network management<br>
station 1090 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In some forms of a spectrum sensor, there is a SAGE 20, but no other<br>
processing component, such as the embedded processor. The sensor would be<br>
connected to a processor in a host device or a remotely located server, etc., where<br>
the output of the SAGE 20 is processed to perform the signal<br>
measurement/accumulation, classification, etc. This may be desirable for a low<br>
cost spectrum sensor used as part of a sensor overlay network, where the majority<br>
of the signal processing is performed at one or more centrally located computing<br>
devices.<br>
Still another variation is to implement the functions of the SAGE 20 in<br>
software on the host processor 3002. The output of the ADC of any one or more<br>
device(s) operating in the frequency band (particularly those devices having a<br>
wideband capable radio receiver) can be supplied to a host processor where the<br>
spectrum management functions described above are performed entirely in<br>
software, such as the measurement engine, classification engine, etc. For example,<br>
the output of the ADC 18 may be coupled across any one of the interfaces shown in<br>
FIG. 12 to the host processor 3002 which executes in software the SAGE<br>
processes, as well as one or more of the other processes.<br>
The spectrum sensor may be deployed in any device that resides in a region<br>
where operation in an unlicensed or shared frequency band is occurring. For<br>
example, it can reside in a consumer device such as a camera, home stereo,<br>
peripheral to a PC, etc. Any other device connected to a spectrum sensor may<br>
obtain the spectrum knowledge that the spectrum sensor acquires, and add it to any<br>
knowledge it may acquire about the spectrum itself, from its own spectrum<br>
monitoring capabilities, if supported. Moreover, the spectrum knowledge a local<br>
device (e.g., a PC) acquires from a remote device may be useful to configure and/or<br>
diagnose the operation at the local device (e.g., a PDA) as well as at the remote<br>
device.<br><br>
The LMAC logic 4080 may be implemented in software that is executed by<br>
the embedded processor 4040. One advantage of a software-implemented LMAC<br>
is that additional statistics associated with protocol X can be generated more easily<br>
than would otherwise be necessary in a firmware implementation. These statistics<br>
may be accumulated by software counters and allocated memory locations in the<br>
LMAC software. Examples of additional IEEE 802.11 statistics that the radio<br>
devices shown in FIGs. 11 and 12 may generate are described hereinafter. Some of<br>
these statistics are good indicators of a performance degradation in a device, such<br>
as a WLAN AP or WLAN STA, and can be used to automatically initiate<br>
corrective action or controls, or to generate information to alert a user/network<br>
administrator, software application, etc. Many of these statistics may be provided<br>
by 32 bit counters, and can wrap. The wrap interval depends on the specific<br>
statistic, but can be as short as 5 minutes. Software from a host driver may<br>
periodically poll these counters and convert them to 64 bit counters (wrap time of<br>
43 Kyears), which will reduce on-chip memory requirements.<br>
Examples of additional IEEE 802.11 MIB Extensions that may be provided<br>
for STAs from statistics generated by the LMAC logic are explained below. These<br>
statistics can be used to determine general channel problems, and problems that<br>
affect a subset of the STAs, such as those based on position and localized<br>
interference. For example, these statistics can indicate packet error rate (PER)<br>
information and provide insight into possible types of interference and be used to<br>
help adjust fragmentation and RTS thresholds.<br>
lmst_RxTime	Timestamp of when the last frame (of any type) was<br>
received from this STA. This implies that the STA is present on the channel, but<br>
does not imply it is responding, in an association/authentication state, or other<br>
higher level activity. For a multicast STA entry, it is updated when the last<br>
multicast frame was sent.<br>
lmst_AckMSDU Number of MSDU's that were successfully sent, i.e.,<br>
the last/only fragment was ACK-ed, or it was multicast. The total number of<br>
data/mgmt frames sent is derived by the number acknowledged, and the number<br>
that were not.<br><br>
lmst_AckFrag	Number of fragments successfully sent (excluding<br>
final fragment counted in lmst_AckMSDU).<br>
lmst_RxCTS	Number of times an RTS was sent, and the CTS was<br>
received. The number of RTS frames sent is derived from the number of CTS<br>
frames received, and the number that were not.<br>
lmst_NoCTS	Number of times an RTS was sent, and no CTS was<br>
received.<br>
lmst_RxACK	Number of unicast data/mgmt frames sent, and an<br>
explicit ACK frame was received. This indicates actual ACK control frames, rather<br>
than PCF/HCF piggy backed ACKs. For PER calculation, lmst_AckMSDU +<br>
lmst_AckFrag may be more useful. The difference between those statistics, and<br>
this field is the number of piggy backed ACK's processed.<br>
lmst_NoACK	Number of unicast data/mgmt frames sent, and no<br>
ACK was received.<br>
lmst_BadCRC	Number of times a CTS or ACK control frame was<br>
expected, and a frame with a CRC error was received instead. This probably<br>
means that the frame was received by the recipient, and the response was lost.<br>
Other frames with CRC errors can not be correlated, as the frame type and source<br>
address fields would be suspect.<br>
lmst_BadPLCP	Number of times a CTS or ACK control frame was<br>
expected, and a frame that the PHY could not demodulate was received instead.<br>
This probably means that the frame was received by the recipient, and the response<br>
was lost. Other frame with PLCP errors can not be correlated, as the frame type<br>
and source address fields are not provided from the PHY. This condition is also<br>
counted under the ImifBadPLCP statistic.<br>
lmst_MaxRetry	Indicates frames that were dropped due to excessive<br>
retransmission.<br>
lmst_HistRetry[8] Provides a histogram of the number of retransmission<br>
attempts, before a response is received. This includes RTS to CTS, and each<br>
Fragment to ACK in a Frame Exchange Sequence. Index 0 is for frames sent<br>
successfully the first time. This should typically produce an inverse exponential<br><br>
curve, and if it significantly deviates it may indicate large outages, such as far side<br>
interference from a microwave oven.<br>
lmst_HistSize[2][4] Provides a histogram of PER vs. Frame size. The first<br>
index is OK and No response, and the second index is for frame size (in quarters)<br>
relative to the fragmentation threshold. Used to speed adjustment of fragmentation<br>
threshold.<br>
These following statistics provide information on data/management frames<br>
received. A statistic may be kept on every frame received. Some statistics are only<br>
expected on an AP or a STA unless there are overlapping BSSs on a channel, and<br>
may provide insight into lost channel bandwidth due to this overlap.<br>
Imst_FiltUcast	The data/management frame was filtered because it<br>
was addressed to another STA.<br>
lmst_FiltMcast	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it was<br>
directed to a multicast address that is not enabled in the multicast address hash.<br>
lmst_FiltSelf	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it was a<br>
multicast frame that was being forwarded into the BSS by the AP.<br>
lmst_FiltBSS	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it was a<br>
multicast frame and its BSSID did not match the filter.<br>
lmst_FiltType	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because its frame<br>
type/sub-type were disabled from the frame type filter. This would include null<br>
data frame types, unsupported mgmt frame types, and could include other types<br>
during a BSS scan.<br>
lmst_FiltDup	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it was a<br>
duplicate of a previously received frame. This indicates that ACK frames are being<br>
lost. Although not all errors are detected here, this can provide a coarse<br>
approximation of the PER in the reverse direction.<br>
lmst_FwdUcast	A unicast data/mgmt frame was delivered to the<br>
embedded processor.<br>
lmst_FwdMcast	A multicast data/mgmt frame was delivered to the<br>
embedded processor.<br><br>
lmst_BadKey	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it required<br>
a decryption key that had not been provided. This indicates a configuration error on<br>
one side of the connection.<br>
lmst_BadICV	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it failed to<br>
decrypt successfully. This may indicate a security attack.<br>
lmst_TooSmall	The data/mgmt frame was filtered because it was<br>
encrypted, but did not include the required encryption header. This indicates a<br>
protocol error.<br>
These following statistics provide information on other frame exchanges.<br>
lmst_RxRTSother Number of times an RTS was received that was not<br>
addressed to this STA.<br>
lmst_TxCTS	Number of times an RTS was received, and a CTS<br>
was sent in response.<br>
lmst_TxACK	Number of times an unicast data/mgmt frame was<br>
received, and a ACK was sent in response.<br>
The following statistics may provide information useful for adjusting a<br>
transmit data rate.<br>
lmst_TxAveRate Running average of rate for data/mgmt frames<br>
transmitted successfully. Divide by (lmst_AckMSDU + lmst_AckFrag) for average<br>
rate code. This counts only acknowledged frames.<br>
lmst_RxAveRate Running average of rate for unicast data/mgmt<br>
frames received successfully. Divide by lmst_TxACK for average rate code. This<br>
includes all acknowledged frames, including filtered frames. Since this can include<br>
duplicates (lmst_FiltDup), its value is not completely symmetrical with transmit.<br>
The following statistics provide information on frames received with<br>
various errors, and can not be traced back to the originating station.<br>
lmif_SaveCRC[3] This provides the timestamp and PHY statistics for<br>
the last frame received with a CRC error.<br>
Imif_BadCRC	Number of frames received with CRC errors are<br>
either counted here, or under lmst_BadCRC.<br>
lmif_SavePLCP[4] This provides the timestamp, PLCP Headers, and<br>
PHY statistics for the last frame received counted under ImifJBadPLCP.<br><br>
lmif_BadPLCP[4] Number of frames received which the PHY could not<br>
demodulate the PHY headers, broken down by cause. These include CRC/Parity<br>
error, bad SFD field, invalid/unsupported rate, and invalid/unsupported modulation.<br>
lmif_SaveMisc[3] This provides the timestamp, PHY statistics, and first<br>
4 bytes of the MAC header for the last frame received for the remaining receive<br>
errors listed in this group.<br>
lmif_TooSmall	Number of frames received that were too small for<br>
their frame type/sub-type. This indicates a protocol error.<br>
lmif_BadVer	Number of frames received with an<br>
invalid/unsupported version. This indicates a protocol error, or a newer<br>
(incompatible) version of the 802.11 specification has been released.<br>
lmif_BadType	Number of Control (or Reserved) frames received<br>
with an invalid/unsupported frame type/sub-type. This indicates a protocol error, or<br>
a newer version of the 802.11 specification has been released.<br>
Imif_BadSrc	Number of frames that were dropped because the<br>
source address was a multicast address. This indicates a protocol error.<br>
lmif_FromUs	Number of frames that were received from "our"<br>
MAC address. This indicates a security attack, and should be reported to a network<br>
management application.<br>
The following statistics provide information on other frame exchanges,<br>
where the source address is unknown.<br>
lmif_RxCTSother Number of CTS frames directed to other stations.<br>
lmif_RxCTSbad	Number of CTS frames received, when no RTS was<br>
outstanding. This indicates a protocol error.<br>
lmif_RxACKother Number of ACK frames directed to other stations.<br>
lmif_RxACKbad Number of ACK frames received, when no<br>
data/mgmt frame was outstanding. This indicates a protocol error.<br>
The following statistics provide information on channel usage, and carrier<br>
sensor multiple access (CSMA).<br>
seq_CntRx Time spent receiving 802.11 frames, in 0.5 us units. Some<br>
of the time spent demodulating frames is counted under seq_CntCCA until the<br>
PHY header has been processed.<br><br>
seq_CntTx Time spent transmitting 802.11 frames, in 0.5 Âµs units.<br>
seq_CntCCA Time spent with energy detected, but not receiving 802.11<br>
frames, in 0.5 Âµs units. Some of the time spent demodulating frames is counted<br>
under seq_CntCCA until the PHY header has been processed. This can also be<br>
used to detect the presence of strong interference that has locked out the network<br>
(denying service to the network), such as a baby monitor.<br>
seq_CntEna Time spent with the channel Enabled and Idle, in 0.5 Âµs<br>
units. This includes time when the channel can not be used due to CSMA, such as<br>
SIFS time and channel backoff time. High usage may provide indications of denial<br>
of service attacks, or the presence of hidden nodes.<br>
seq_Timer Time since last LMAC reset (uptime), in 0.5 Âµs units. Any<br>
time not accounted for from the previous 4 counters indicates time the channel was<br>
disabled.<br>
lmif_CCAcnt Number of times receive energy was detected. This does not<br>
include any transmit time.<br>
lmif_CCAofher	Number of times receive energy was detected, but no<br>
802.11 frame was received (even frames that could not be demodulated).<br>
lmif_RxFIP Total number of receive events, as indicated in other per<br>
frame type statistics.<br>
lmif_TxFIP Total number of transmit events, as indicated in other per<br>
frame type statistics.<br>
lmif_TxSkip Number of times that the channel was available for<br>
transmission by the CSMA protocol, but no frame was available for transmission:<br>
This can help distinguish performance problems that are due to upper MAC<br>
(UMAC) or host processor bottlenecks versus 802.11 channel or protocol<br>
limitations.<br>
lmif_CWnBack	Number of times a channel Backoff or Deferral was<br>
performed.<br>
lmif_C Wused	Number of slot times consumed by Backoff and<br>
Deferral.<br>
lmif_HistDefer[4] For each attempt to start a Frame Exchange<br>
Sequence, this indicates if a Deferral or Backoff was required, and the cause. The 4<br><br>
cases are: No Deferral required; Deferred after receive energy and/or receive<br>
frame; Deferred after transmission; and Backoff after not receiving a CTS/ACK<br>
response. Only a single entry for the last cause may be counted before each<br>
attempted Frame Exchange Sequence.<br>
Spectrum Activity Information and Accessing it Using the NSI<br>
The measurement engine 50, classification engine 52, location engine 54<br>
spectrum expert 56 perform spectrum analysis functions and generate information<br>
that may be used by application programs or systems that access these functions<br>
through the NSI 70. The NSI 70 may be embodied by instructions stored on a<br>
computer/processor readable medium and executed by the processor (server 1055<br>
or network management station 1090) that executes the one or more application<br>
program or systems. For example, this processor would execute instructions for an<br>
NSI "client" function that generates the request and configurations for spectrum<br>
analysis functions and receives the resulting data for the application program. The<br>
processor(s) that execute(s) the measurement engine, classification engine, location<br>
engine and/or spectrum expert will execute instructions stored on an associated<br>
computer/processor readable medium (shown in FIGs. 1, 11 or 12) to execute an<br>
NSI "server" function that responds to requests from the NSI client to generate<br>
configuration parameters and initiate spectrum analysis functions by the<br>
measurement engine, classification engine, location engine and/or spectrum expert<br>
to perform the requested spectrum analysis function and return the resulting data.<br>
The measurement engine may in turn generate controls for the SAGE drivers 15 to<br>
configure the SAGE 20 and/or radio 12.<br>
It should be further understood that the classification engine, location<br>
engine and spectrum expert can be viewed as a client to the measurement engine<br>
and would generate requests to, and receive data from, the measurement engine<br>
similar to She manner in which an application program would interact with the<br>
measurement engine. Further still, the spectrum expert can be viewed as a client to<br>
the classification engine and location engine and request analysis services of those<br>
engines.<br><br>
The NSI 70 may be transport independent (e.g., supports Sockets, SNMP,<br>
RMON, etc.) and may be designed for implementation in a wired or wireless<br>
format, such as by TCP/IP traffic from an 802.11 AP to a PC which is running<br>
software designed to accept the traffic for further analysis and processing. The<br>
TCP/IP traffic (or traffic using some other network protocol) could also be carried<br>
by a PCI bus inside a laptop PC, provided the PC has built-in 802.11 technology, or<br>
an 802.11 NIC. If the source of the spectrum information data stream is a TCP/IP<br>
connection, the application program would implement a socket, and access the<br>
correct port, to read the data stream. A sample of typical code for this purpose is<br>
shown below. (The sample is in Java, and shows client-side code.) Once the port<br>
connection to the data stream is established, the use of the data stream is<br>
determined by the network management software itself.<br><br>
The class DatalnputStream has methods such as read. The class<br>
DataOutputStream allows one to write Java primitive data types; one of its<br>
methods is writeBytes. These methods can be used to read data from, and write<br>
data to, the NSI 70.<br><br>
If the transport of the data stream occurs over other low-level media, other<br>
methods are used to access the data stream. For example, if the data is carried over<br>
a PC's PCI bus, a PCI device driver will typically provide access to the data.<br>
The information provided by the NSI to an application program corresponds<br>
to data generated by the measurement engine 50 (through the SAGE), classification<br>
engine 52, location engine 54, and/or the spectrum expert 56.<br>
In acting as the API, the NSI has a first group of messages that identify (and<br>
initiate) the spectrum analysis function (also called a service or test) to be<br>
performed and provide configuration information for the function. These are called<br>
session control messages and are sent by the application program to the NSI.<br>
There is a second group of messages, called informational messages, that are sent<br>
by the NSI (after the requested spectrum analysis functions are performed) to the<br>
application program containing the test data of interest.<br>
Most of the spectrum analysis functions (i.e., tests) have various<br>
configuration parameters, which are sent via session control messages, and which<br>
determine specific details of the test. For example, in monitoring the spectrum,<br>
session control messages tell the NSI how wide the bandwidth should be<br>
(narrowband or wideband), and the center frequency of the bandwidth being<br>
monitored. In many cases, detailed test configuration parameters for a spectrum<br>
analysis function can be omitted from the session control messages. In those cases,<br>
the NSI uses default settings.<br>
Examples of spectrum analysis functions that the measurement engine 50<br>
(in conjunction with the services of the SAGE 20) may perform, and the resulting<br>
data that is returned, include:<br>
Spectrum Analyzer Power vs. Frequency Data. This data describes the total<br>
power in the spectrum as a function of frequency, over a given bandwidth.<br>
Spectrum Analyzer Statistics Data. This data provides a statistical analysis<br>
of the data in RF power vs. frequency measurements.<br>
Pulse Event Data - This data describes characteristics on individual RF<br>
pulses detected by the SAGE 20. The characteristics for (and thus the types of<br>
pulses) detected by the SAGE 20 can be configured.<br><br>
Pulse Histogram Data. This data describes the distribution of pulses per<br>
unit of time, in terms of the percentage of pulses distributed among different<br>
frequencies, energy levels, and bandwidths.<br>
Snapshot Data. This data contain portions of raw digital data of the RF<br>
spectrum captured by the snapshot buffer of the SAGE 20. The data can help<br>
identify the location of devices, and can also be used to extract identifier<br>
information which can determine the brand of certain devices operating in the<br>
frequency band, for example. Snapshot data may also be useful for signal<br>
classification.<br>
The classification engine 52 may perform spectrum analysis functions to<br>
determine and classify the types of signals occurring in the frequency band, and<br>
together with optional recommendation or descriptive information that may be<br>
provided by the classification engine 52 or the spectrum expert 56, the resulting<br>
data that is returned are called spectrum event data, which describe specific events,<br>
such as detecting a particular signal type as going active or inactive in the<br>
frequency band. The spectrum expert 54, as well as the network expert 80 and<br>
other applications or processes may use the output of the classification engine 52.<br>
There are numerous ways to format the NSI messages to provide the desired<br>
API functionality in connection with the spectrum analysis functions. The<br>
following are examples of message formats that are provided for the sake of<br>
completeness, but it should be understood that other API message formats may be<br>
used to provide the same type of interface between an application program and<br>
spectrum analysis functions pertaining to activity in a frequency band where<br>
signals of multiple types may be simultaneously occurring.<br>
A common message header may be used by both session control messages<br>
and information messages. The common header, called the sm1StdHdr_t header,<br>
comes at the very beginning of all messages and provides certain general<br>
identifying information for the message. An example of the general format of the<br>
common header is explained in the table below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples of informational messages, which as suggested above, are NSI<br>
formatted versions of the output of the measurement engine 50 and classification<br>
engine 52, and optionally the spectrum expert 54, are described.<br>
Spectrum Analyzer Power vs. Frequency Data<br><br>
The SAGE 20 will analyze a frequency band centered at a frequency which<br>
may be controlled. Moreover, the bandwidth of the frequency band analyzed may<br>
be controlled. For example, a portion, such as 20 MHz (narrowband mode), of an<br>
entire frequency band may be analyzed, or substantially an entire frequency band<br>
may be analyzed, such as 100 MHz (wideband mode). The selected frequency<br>
band, is divided into a plurality of frequency "bins" (e.g., 256 bins), or adjacent<br>
frequency sub-bands. For each bin, and for each sample time interval, a report is<br>
made from the output of the SAGE 20 on the power detected within that bin as<br>
measured in dBm. The measurement engine 50 supplies the configuration<br>
parameters to the SAGE drivers 15 and accumulates the output of the SAGE 20<br>
(FIG. 1).<br>
FIG. 22 (also described further hereinafter) illustrates a graph that may be<br>
created from power measurements taken at a given time interval. In the<br>
illustration, the vertical bars do not represent the distinct frequency bins. Of the<br>
two jagged lines shown in FIG. 22, the lower line represents a direct graph of the<br>
data in a single snapshot of the spectrum at a given instant in time. It corresponds<br>
to the data in one, single sapfListEntries field, described below. However, a<br>
spectrum analysis message may contain multiple sapfListEntries fields; each such<br>
field corresponding to a single snapshot of the spectrum. The upper jagged line<br>
was constructed by a software application. It represents the peak values seen in the<br>
RF spectrum over the entire testing period to the present instant.<br>
An example of the structure of the spectrum analyzer power vs. frequency<br>
data is as follows.<br><br><br><br>
In the second standard header, the msgType is 46 to identify the message as<br>
an informational message, and the sessType is 10 (SM_L1_SESS_SAPF) to<br>
identify that data results from a session that is a spectrum analyzer power vs.<br>
frequency test.<br>
The field below is the standard information header for spectrum analyzer<br>
power vs. frequency data.<br><br>
This field sm1SapfMsgHdr_t below describes the frequency spectrum that<br>
is being monitored. While this message provides the center frequency and the<br>
width of the bins, it may not provide the total bandwidth being measured. This can<br>
be calculated (low end = frqCenterkHz - 128 * binSize, high end = frqCenterkHz +<br>
128 * binSize. The radio receiver being used to monitor the bandwidth need not<br>
actually span the full bandwidth. As a result, some of the frequency bins at either<br>
end of the spectrum will typically show zero (0) RF power.<br><br>
For a single snapshot of the RF spectrum at a moment in time, the<br>
sapfListEntries field explained below contains the information of primary interest,<br>
namely, the power level in dBm for each of the frequency bins.<br><br><br>
The frequency range corresponding to bin "N", where N goes from 0 to<br>
255, is given by:<br>
LowFrequency[N] = sm1SapfMsgHdr_t.frqCenterKHz<br>
+ (N- 128) * sm1SapfMsgHdr_t.binSizeKHz<br>
HighFrequency[N] = smlSapfMsgHdr_t.frqCenterKHz<br>
+ (N- 127) * smlSapfMsgHdr_t.binSizeKHz<br>
Spectrum Analyzer Statistics Data<br>
The spectrum analyzer statistics data/messages provide a statistical analysis<br>
of the data in the frequency spectrum.<br>
A single message is built from a specified number of FFT cycles, where a<br>
single FFT cycle represents an, e.g., 256 frequency bin output of the FFT. For<br>
example, 40,000 successive FFTs of the RF spectrum, taken over a total time of .<br>
1/10 of a second, are used to construct the statistics for a single message.<br>
FIG. 23 shows the kind of information that can be conveyed in the spectrum<br>
analyzer statistics data. The bottom line shows the average power over the<br>
sampling period (i.e., over the 40,000 FFTs, or 1/10 second). The top line<br>
represents the "absolute maximum power" over all spectrum analyzer statistics<br>
messages received so far.<br>
An example of the overall structure of the spectrum analyzer statistics data<br>
is:<br><br><br><br>
This message header sm1SaStatsMsgHdr_t field contains parameters which<br>
describe the sampling process, examples of which are below.<br><br>
There are, for example, 256 consecutive statsBins, each with four sub-fields<br>
as shown in the table below. Each statsBin, with its four subfields, contains the<br>
statistical data for a particular bandwidth. To calculate the width of each frequency<br>
bin, the following formula may be used:<br>
bin Width = sm1SaStatsMsgHdr_t. bwKHz / 256<br>
The lower and upper bandwidth for each bin is giving by the following<br>
formulas:<br><br>
LowBandwidth[N] = sm1SaStatsMsgHdr_t. centerFreqKHz + ((N- 128) *<br>
binWidth)<br>
HighBandwidth[N] = sm1SaStatsMsgHdr_t. centerFreqKHz + ((N- 127) *<br>
binWidth)<br><br>
There are ten consecutive activeBins which record "peak" activity. The<br>
bins may be viewed as being indexed consecutively, from 0 to 9. For each bin, the<br>
value in the bin should be interpreted as follows. In the Nth bin, if the value in the<br>
bin is X, then for (X/2)% of the time, there were N peaks in the RF spectrum<br>
during the sampling period, except for the special case below for the 10th bin,<br>
called bin 9.<br><br><br><br>
As described above in conjunction with the SAGE 20, peaks are spikes, or<br>
very brief energy bursts in the RF spectrum. If a burst persists for a certain period<br>
of time (e.g., approximately 2.5 usec), the SAGE 20 will detect the peak, and the<br>
peak will be included in the statistics described in this subsection. Such brief peaks<br>
are generally not included in pulse data or pulse statistics. Also as described above, .<br>
if a series of consecutive peaks are seen over a continuous time period, all at the<br>
same frequency, this seriesâ€”once it reaches some minimum time thresholdâ€”it<br>
will be counted as a pulse. FIG. 23 also shows how the number of peaks may be<br>
displayed associated with activity in the frequency band.<br>
The exact minimum duration of a pulse, for testing purposes, is<br>
configurable by the application program, but a typical time may be 100 usee.<br>
Since the SAGE 20can detect RF events as brief as 2.5 usec, a typical pulse would<br>
need to persist through at least 40 FFTs before being acknowledged as being a<br>
pulse.<br>
Pulse Event Data<br>
A signal pulse is a sustained emission of RF energy in a specific bandwidth<br>
starting at a specific time. The SAGE 20 detects pulses in the radio frequency<br>
band that satisfy certain configurable characteristics (e.g., ranges) for bandwidth,<br>
center frequency, duration and time between pulses (also referred to as "pulse<br>
gap"). When the SAGE 20 detects a pulse that has these characteristics, it outputs<br>
pulse event data for the pulse including:<br>
Start Time - Measured from when the SAGE first begins detecting pulses.<br>
Duration - The lifetime of the pulse.<br>
Center Frequency - The center frequency of the pulse.<br>
Bandwidth - How wide the pulse is.<br>
Power - Average power in dBm.<br>
The overall structure of a pulse event (PEVT) data/message is shown in the<br>
table below.<br><br><br>
This information header field is the standard information header for pulse<br>
event messages.<br><br>
There may be one or many pulse events in the message. Each instance of<br>
the classPevts field below, describes the properties of one pulse.<br><br><br><br>
Pulse Histogram Data<br>
While it is possible to access information about individual pulses, it may<br>
also be useful to work with the statistical information about pulses detected and<br>
occurring in the frequency band over time. That information is provided by pulse<br>
histogram data. The pulse histograms track distributions of: duration of the pulses<br>
(the percentage of pulses with short, medium, and long durations); gaps in time<br>
between the pulses (the percentage of pulses with short time gaps between them,<br>
medium time gaps, and long time gaps); bandwidth of pulses; frequency of pulses;<br>
and power of pulses.<br>
FIG. 24 illustrates graphical displays for exemplary pulse histograms.<br>
The overall structure of the pulse histogram data is shown in the following<br>
table.<br><br>
This PhistMsgHdr field describes the frequency spectrum which is being<br>
monitored, and some other parameters of the overall sampling process.<br><br><br><br>
The pulse duration histogram fields contain a series of bytes. Each of the<br>
data bytes, or binsâ€”in sequenceâ€”indicates the percentage (multiplied by two) of<br><br>
pulses that fall into a given range of durations. The table below categorizes data<br>
into smallBins, mediumBins, and largeBins and are only examples of how to track<br>
pulse duration.<br>
The first bin (bin 0) contains the percentage (x2) of pulses that were<br>
between 0 Âµsec and 9 Âµsec. The second bin (bin 1) contains the percentage,<br>
multiplied by 2, of pulses that were between 10 Âµsec and 19 Âµsec in duration. Each<br>
of these "bins" is 10 Âµsec wide. This continues up to the 20th bin (bin 19), whose<br>
value is the percentage, multiplied times 2, of pulses that were between 190 and<br>
199 Âµsec in length.<br>
The next twenty-six bins are similar, except they are wider; specifically,<br>
they are 50 Âµsec wide. Bin 20 has a value which indicates the percentage (x2) of<br>
pulses that were between 200 Âµsec and 249 Âµsec in length. Again, there are<br>
twenty-six bins which are 50 Âµsec wide. Bin number 45 has a value which<br>
indicates the percentage (times 2) of pulses that were between 1450 Âµsec and 1499<br>
Âµsec in length.<br>
The final set of 27 bins each indicate the percentage (x2) of pulses that are<br>
wider still, specifically 500 Âµsec wide. Bin number 46 includes pulses whose<br>
duration was between 1500 Âµsec and 1999 Âµsec in.length. Bin 72 includes pulses<br>
whose duration was between 14499 and 14999 Âµsec.<br>
Pulse Duration Histogram Bins<br><br><br><br>
The pulse gap histogram indicates the percentage (multiplied by two) of<br>
gaps between pulses, where the duration of the gap falls within a given time range.<br>
The bins do not reflect when the gaps occurred, they reflect how long the gaps<br>
were. Gaps are measured between the start of one pulse and the start of the next.<br>
This is because the start of a pulse tends to be sharply delineated, while a pulse<br>
may trail off more gradually. For example, assume there were a total of twenty<br>
gaps between pulses. Of these twenty, only two gaps had a duration between 10<br>
Âµsec and 19 Âµsec. The first gap, which lasted 12 Âµsec, occurred at time 15.324<br>
seconds. The second gap, which lasted 15 Âµsec, occurred at time 200.758 seconds.<br>
Both gaps are recorded in the second bin (numbered as bin 1). Since the two gaps<br>
reflect 10% of all recorded gaps, the value in the second bin (bin 1) will be 2 x 10%<br>
= 20 (since all percentages are multiplied by two). -<br>
Pulse Gap Histogram Bins<br><br><br><br>
For the pulse bandwidth histogram, each data bin reflects a progressively<br>
wider bandwidth. For example, if the first bin represents pulses from 0 to 9.999<br>
kHz in width, then the second bin represents pulses from 10 kHz to 19.999 kHz, the<br>
third bin pulses from 20 kHz to 29.999 kHz in width, etc. The value stored in the<br>
bin is the percentage (x2) of the pulses that had a bandwidth somewhere within the<br>
indicated range. For example, assume the size of each bin is 80 kHz. Suppose<br>
also that the SAGE 20 detected 1000 pulses and there are 256 frequency bins. The<br>
pulses with a bandwidth between 0 and 20,480 kHz. As another example, assume<br>
the SAGE 20 detects 65 pulses, each of which had a bandwidth somewhere<br>
between 400 and 480 kHz. Then, 6.5% of the pulses fall within the sixth<br>
bandwidth range, so the 6th bin (bin number 5) will have a value of 2 x 6.5% = 13-<br>
The bandwidth bins may have exactly the same width. For example, if the<br>
first bin is 80 kHz wide (and includes data for pulses with bandwidths from 0 to<br>
79.999 kHz), then all successive bins will be 80 kHz wide. The second bin<br>
includes pulses from 80 kHz to 159.999 kHz; and the 256th binâ€”still 80 kHz<br>
wideâ€”includes pulses with bandwidths from 20,400 kHz to 20,479.999 kHz.<br>
Pulse Bandwidth Histogram Bins<br><br><br><br>
For the pulse center frequency histogram, each data bin reflects a range of<br>
frequencies. The value stored in the bin is the percentage, multiplied times two, of<br>
the pulses whose center frequency fell within the indicated range of frequencies.<br>
All frequency bins may be exactly the same width. However, in general,<br>
the lowest bin (byte number 0) does not start with the frequency 0 Hz. Recall that<br>
the pulse histogram message header (PhistMsgHdr_t) has a sub-field<br>
histCenterFreqkHz, which is measure in kHz. This field defines the center<br>
frequency for the pulse center frequency histogram.<br>
The following formulae give the actual frequency range covered by each<br>
bin of this histogram, indicating both the low frequency and the high frequency of<br>
the range. The number N is the bin number, where bin numbers are counted from<br>
freqBins 0 to freqBins 255:<br>
Low Frequ. (bin N) = histCenterFreqkHz - (128 * binSizekHz) + (N *<br>
binSizekHz)<br>
High Frequ. (bin N) = histCenterFreqkHz - (128 * binSizekHz) + ((N + 1)<br>
* binSizekHz))<br>
Suppose the size of each bin, in kHz, is 100 kHz, and that the bandwidth is<br>
2.4 GHz. Frequencies are actually being monitored in the range from 2,387,200<br>
kHz to 2,412,800 kHz.. Suppose also that SAGE 20 detected 1000 pulses, and 80<br>
pulses with center frequencies in the range from 2,387,600 kHz to 2,387,699 kHz.<br>
Then 8% of the pulses fall within the fifth bandwidth range, so bin 4 will have a<br>
value of 2 x 8%=16.<br>
The field structure for the pulse center frequency histogram is indicated in<br>
the table below.<br><br>
Pulse Center Frequency Histogram Bins<br><br>
For the pulse power histogram, each bin reflects a certain power range,<br>
measured in dBm. The value of each bin reflects the percentage (x2) of those<br>
pulses whose power level fell within the indicated range.<br>
Pulse Power Histogram Bins<br><br>
Snapshot Data<br>
Snapshot data, unlike other data provided by the NSI, is not based on data<br>
analysis by the SAGE or software. Rather, this data provide raw data from the<br>
ADC which precedes the SAGE and that converts the received signal analog signal<br>
to digital data.<br>
The raw ADC data may be expressed in n-bit I/Q format, where 'n' is<br>
indicated by 'bitsPerSample'. The snapshot samples can be used for location<br>
measurements, or for detailed pulse classification (such as identifying the exact<br>
model of a device). The size of the sample data contained in 'snapshotSamples' is<br>
typically 8 K bytes. The overall structure of the message is shown in the following<br>
table.<br><br>
(JO<br><br>
An example of a snapshot message smSnapshotMsg_t field is defined<br>
below.<br><br>
Spectrum Event Data (e.g., Monitoring Activity of Signals')<br>
The msgType for spectrum event data is 46 and the sessType is 14<br>
(SM_L1_SESS_EVENT). A format for the smEventMsg_t spectrum event<br>
message field is described in the table below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples of the manner in which spectrum event messages may be<br>
displayed are shown in FIGs. 16-20, and described hereinafter.<br>
Software and systems communicate requests to the NSI for data from the<br>
services on the other side of the NSI using the session control messages referred to<br>
above. An example of the format of the session control messages is as follows.<br>
There is a standard header followed by information elements. An information<br>
element is a data structure with several parts, as described in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
Typical information elements provide data such as the SAGE configuration<br>
data, radio configuration data, and service specific data (e.g., pulse data, spectrum<br>
data, etc.). Examples of NSI information elements are provided in the table below:<br><br><br><br>
There is an advantage to using information elements in NSI session control<br>
messages. The format of session control messages can be modified or expanded<br>
over time, as technology is further developed, while requiring no revisions to<br>
existing software or systems that use the NSI. In other words, enhancements to the<br>
messages do not break legacy code.<br>
In traditional software design, the network management software would be<br>
coded with the expectation of specific data structures for each of the session control<br>
messages. Any time the session control messages were changed or enhanced,<br>
changes would be required in the code for the network management software, and<br>
the code would need to be recompiled.<br>
With session control messages, however, this is no longer necessary.<br>
Session control messages are processed as follows.<br>
1.	The requesting software or system reads the message header, and<br>
determines what kind of message it is receiving.<br>
2.	Software developers know what kinds of information elements will<br>
follow the header field based on a specification document. Design decisions are<br>
made to determine what kinds of actions the software or system will take in<br>
response to those information elements.<br>
3.	In the code itself, after reading the header field, the software loops<br>
through information elements which follow. Only for information elements of<br>
interestâ€”which can by flagged by the infoElementType field in each information<br>
elementâ€”the software takes appropriate action.<br>
Additional information elements may be added to some of the session<br>
control messages. However, during the "looping" process the requesting software<br>
ignores any information elements which are not of interest to it, so the additional<br>
information elements in the control messages do not require any changes in the<br>
software code. Of course, it may be desirable to upgrade a software program to<br><br>
take advantage of additional types of information; but again, until that new<br>
software is in place, existing software continues to function.<br>
This benefit works in both directions. For example, in sending messages to<br>
the NSI, the software program can send an information element which fine-tunes<br>
the behavior of the SAGE. Typically, however, SAGE's default operating modes<br>
are satisfactory, and there is no need to make changes. Rather than having to send<br>
an information element containing redundant, default configuration data for SAGE,<br>
this information element can simply be omitted.<br>
A handshaking type protocol may be used to setup, initiate and terminate a<br>
session between the application and the NSI. There are numerous techniques<br>
known in the art to provide this function. For example, all tests are started by<br>
sending a sm1StdHdr_t field. Additional, optional information elements may<br>
follow. The NSI responds with messages indicating that the test has started<br>
successfully; that it was rejected; or that the test is pending (the test is queued<br>
behind other requests for the same service). The four possible session control reply<br>
messages are Started, Pending, Rejected, and Stop.<br>
All Start Messages may have the following structure:<br>
1.- A required sm1StdHdr_t field with a msgType value of<br>
SESS_START_REQ (40), and a value for sessType to indicate the test to be<br>
performed. This field may come first. For example, to start a pulse event test, the<br>
sessType value of 12 is used, to start a pulse histogram test, a sessType value of 13<br>
is used, to start a spectrum analyzer power vs. frequency test, a sessType value of<br>
10 is used, etc.<br>
2.	An optional common session configuration information element.<br>
This configures parameters which are of interest for all the possible tests, described<br>
below.<br>
3.	For the Pulse Event test only, an optional information element to<br>
configure the pulse detectors.<br>
4.	Optional information elements to configure the SAGE and the radio.<br>
5.	An optional, vendor-specific information element, typically (but not<br>
necessarily) related to further configurations to the radio.<br><br>
6.	An optional session-type specific information element, with<br>
configuration information for the particular test (PEVT, PHIST, SAPF, etc.).<br>
The general/common session configuration element IE_Session_CFG is<br>
optional when starting tests, i.e., with SESS_START_REQ. If it is not sent, the<br>
default values are used.<br><br><br><br>
The radio is configured to a starting bandwidth (either 2.4 GHz or one of<br>
the 5 GHz bands, for example) before the NSI can begin any testing. Similarly,<br>
before many pulse test services can be run, at least one (if not more) of SAGE's<br>
four pulse detectors need to be configured at least once. These services include<br>
Pulse Events, Pulse Histograms, Snapshot Data, and Spectrum Analyzer Power vs.<br>
Frequency (but only if this test is to be triggered by pulse events). Once the pulse<br>
detectors are configured, they can be left in their initial configuration for<br>
subsequent tests, although the application program can reconfigure them.<br>
The radio configuration element IE_Radio_CFG is described in the table<br>
below. It is used to fine-tune the performance of the radio. If the information<br>
element is not sent as part of the message, the radio is configured to the default<br>
values.<br><br><br>
The SAGE configuration information element IE_SAGE_CFG is optional.<br>
It fine-tunes the performance of the SAGE 20. If the information element is not<br>
sent as part of the message, the SAGE 20 is configured to the default values. An<br>
example of the SAGE configuration element is set forth below.<br><br><br><br>
The IE_VENDOR_CFG information element contains vendor specific<br>
configuration information. Typically this is a configuration that is specific to the<br>
particular radio in use.<br><br>
The NSI provides a pulse detector configuration element (IE_PD_CFG)<br>
which is used to configure the pulse detectors. This element must be used the first<br>
time the pulse detectors are configured. It is also used if and when the pulse<br>
detectors are reconfigured (which may be infrequent). The optional pulse events<br>
test configuration element (IE_PEVT_CFG) are shown in the table below. If this<br>
configuration element is not sent, the default values are used for the test.<br><br><br><br>
Configuring the pulse detectors involves selecting which pulse detector(s)<br>
to use for a test. It also involves providing parameters which indicate the kind of<br>
signal pulse (for example, ranges for signal power, pulse duration, pulse center<br>
frequency, etc.) will, in fact, be interpreted as being a pulse. There are a variety of<br>
options when dealing with pulse detectors:<br>
Use the existing pulse detector configuration for the service.<br>
Allocate a currently unused detector.<br>
Reconfigure an existing pulse detector.<br>
Release a pulse detector so that other sessions may use it.<br>
Whether configuring a pulse detector before using it for the first time, or<br>
reconfiguring the detector, the header field will first be sent with a particular<br>
msgType. This will be followed by the pulse detector configuration element,<br>
IE_PD_CFG, described in the table below. (Other information elements may be<br>
included in the message as well.) Pulse detectors are selected using PD_ID sub-<br>
field values from 0 to 3. These do not correspond to physical pulse detectors;<br>
rather, they are a logical reference to a pulse detector that is used by that transport<br>
connection supporting the sessions.<br><br><br><br>
The field bwThreshDbm takes a signed dBm value that helps determine<br>
which RF signals will be counted as pulses. A pulse is defined by a series of time-<br>
contiguous, and bandwidth continuous "peaks", or brief spikes, which determine<br>
the overall bandwidth of the pulse (thus the reference to "bandwidth threshold"). A<br>
"peak floor" is established to determine which spikes of radio energy qualify as a<br>
valid "peak". Energy spikes below this "peak floor" do not qualify, whereas those<br>
above the "peak floor" do qualify. The bwThreshDbm parameter determines the<br>
"peak floor" based on whether 'bwThreshDbm' is positive or negative:<br><br>
If bwThreshDbm is negative (ex : -65 dBm), then the peak floor is the<br>
same as the value of bwThreshDbm.<br>
If bwThreshDbm is positive (ex : 24 dBm), then the peak floor is<br>
determined dynamically based on the current noise floor:<br>
peak floor dBm = noise floor dBm + bwThreshDbm.<br>
The noise floor based mechanism (bwThreshDbm is positive) is used<br>
almost exclusively because it responds well to changes in the radio spectrum<br>
environment.<br>
There may be pre-defined pulse detection configurations, shown in the table<br>
below, to detect certain types of signal pulses.<br><br>
This following short pulse profile is suitable for detecting short pulse<br>
frequency hoppers, such as Bluetoothâ„¢ headsets and many cordless phones.<br><br><br><br>
The following long pulse profile is suitable for detecting long pulses output<br>
by Microwave Ovens and television transmissions (infant monitors, surveillance<br>
cameras, X-10 cameras, etc.).<br><br>
Before running a pulse histogram test for the first time, the pulse detectors<br>
need to be configured. This is done by first running a pulse event test, described<br>
above. A session control message is sent containing a header field with a sessType<br>
value of '13'. That is followed by the optional information elements, as shown in<br>
the table below detailing the optional pulse histogram test configuration element<br>
(IE_PHIST_CFG). If it is not sent, the default values (shown in the table) are used.<br><br><br><br>
The spectrum analyzer power vs. frequency test is started by sending a<br>
session control message containing a header field with a sessType value of 10';<br>
that is followed by the optional information elements, as shown below.<br><br>
The spectrum analyzer statistics test is started by send a session control<br>
message containing a header field with a sessType value of'11'. That is followed<br>
by the optional information elements, as described below.<br><br><br><br>
The field pwrThreshDbm takes a signed dBm value that helps determine the<br>
minimum power level for the "duty cycle" and the "peak count." The<br>
pwrThreshDbm parameter determines the "floor", or minimum energy level for<br>
these measurements, based on whether pwrThreshDbm is positive or negative:<br>
If pwrThreshDbm is negative (e.g.,: -65 dBm), then the floor is the same<br>
as the value of pwrThreshDbm.<br>
If pwrThreshDbm is positive (e.g.,: 24 dBm), then the floor is determined<br>
dynamically based on the current noise floor: power floor dBm = noise floor dBm<br>
+ pwrThreshDbm. A noise floor based mechanism (pwrThreshDbm is positive) is<br>
used almost exclusively because it responds well to changes in the radio spectrum<br>
environment.<br>
The spectrum event data test is started by sending a message containing a<br>
header field with a sessType value of '14'.<br>
The snapshot message test is started by sending a message containing a<br>
header field with a sessType value of'17', followed by the optional configuration<br>
elements. The optional snapshot message configuration element (IE_SNAP_CFG)<br>
follows. If it is not sent, default values are used for the test.<br><br>
By specifying which pulse detector is used to trigger the snapshot capture, it<br>
is possible to control which types of signal pulses are detected to trigger a raw<br>
ADC data capture.<br><br>
The NSI may reply to test start messages to inform the requesting software<br>
application of the status of the test, and the ability of the underlying applications to<br>
deliver data for the requested tests. It is also possible to stop a test that has been<br>
requested. The table below summarizes the session control status messages which<br>
may be sent via the NSI.<br>
An example of how the NSI can be used to configure and obtain data from a<br>
SAGE pulse detector is shown in FIG. 13. In the diagram, solid lines are for the<br>
unified message and the dotted lines indicate the headers, information elements and<br>
information messages sent that make up a single message. Step 6000 represents a<br>
software application sending to the NSI a start message. The message includes a<br>
message header with a particular msgType value that indicates it is a start message<br>
and a sessType value to indicate that it is a pulse event test. If it is the first<br>
message request sent, the start message includes either the IE_Radio_CFG element,<br>
or the IE_VENDOR_CFG element. Two IE_PD_CFG elements are sent to<br>
configure pulse detector 0 to detect short pulses and pulse detector 1 to detector<br>
long pulses. A pulse event information element IE_PEVT_CFG is also sent to<br>
indicate which of the configured pulse detectors to use. The applicable data from,<br>
the SAGE is generated and made available to the NSI. In step 6010, the NSI<br>
replies with a message confirming that the service was started and the status of the<br>
service in process. In step 6020, a series of informational messages are sent with<br>
data. Each message includes indicates that it is an informational message and<br>
includes one or more of the ClassPevt fields which hold the actual data that<br>
described the measured properties of pulses that are detected within the configured<br>
parameters. Further information messages are sent as shown at step 6030.<br>
Exemplary Spectrum Management Scenarios<br>
Scenario 1: Network Monitoring, Reporting and Acting<br>
Reporting is both the simplest and most powerful application of spectrum<br>
management. In this example, reporting is used to help troubleshoot the presence<br>
of a "rogue" or undesired noise source.<br>
Ex. 1: Corporate WLAN Environment<br><br>
Measurement: Each AP makes measurements of its environment. If an AP<br>
detects an unexpected noise signal, it forwards spectrum and sample data to the<br>
WLAN management server, e.g., server 1055 in FIG. I.<br>
Classification: At the server, the signal is classified based on known signal<br>
pulse information. The location of the signal source is determined.<br>
Policy: The server issues an alert to the WLAN administrator.<br>
"Interferer detected, identified as Panasonic cordless phone in room 400."<br>
Action: The server delivers a report (e.g., emails, on-screen pop-up<br>
window, etc.) to the administrator including spectrum analysis graphs, and<br>
graphical location information. Suggestions for taking corrective action may be<br>
provided to the network administrator.<br>
Ex. 2: Home WLAN Environment<br>
Measurement, Classification: Similar to above, but in this case the AP and<br>
STAs are used for measurements, and classification software runs on the a PC<br>
coupled to a STA.<br>
Policy: User is notified via simple language messages on their PC, but a<br>
reaction is automatic. "A cordless phone is creating interference, hit OK to invoke<br>
the noise solution wizard." The "noise solution wizard" may be a spectrum action<br>
that will remove the effects of the noise on the device, such as by moving to<br>
another channel, etc. Alternatively, the correction action is taken automatically and<br>
the user is displayed event summary information.<br>
FIGs. 14 and 15 illustrate flow charts (modified from the flow chart shown<br>
in FIG. 5) that may be used to carryout the situations of Scenario 1. A user<br>
assistance tool may be provided by way of a software program that is executed on,<br>
for example, a WLAN AP or STA. In the case of a STA, it is possible that the tool<br>
automatically executes a spectrum management action or control, as may be the<br>
case for the home environment. In the case of an AP, where a network<br>
administrator may have supervisory and other control privileges, the tool may not<br>
be automated, but rather give the network administrator user a choice of actions to<br>
take. Of course, the non-automated tool may reside on a device such as a STA.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flow chart of the automated version of the tool, and FIG. 15 is a<br>
flow chart of the non-automated version. The spectrum sampling step 2000, signal<br><br>
classification step 2010 and spectrum policy execution step 2020 are similar to the<br>
like-numbered steps described above in connection with FIG. 5. In FIG. 14, after<br>
the signal classification step 2010, in step 2015 an alert is displayed or announced<br>
to a user (on a computer, for example) if a certain type of signal or interference is<br>
detected based on the output of the signal classification step. In step 2020, a<br>
spectrum policy is then automatically executed based on the output of the signal<br>
classification step, and in step 2025 spectrum event summary information is<br>
displayed or announced to the user. For example, the spectrum action or control<br>
may be to execute an interference avoidance procedure.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, the spectrum sampling, signal classification and<br>
display alert steps 2000, 2010 and 2015 are the same as those described above in<br>
connection with FIG. 14. However, in FIG. 15, after displaying an alert, step 2016<br>
is invoked to display event information with a recommended action. In step 2017,<br>
the user can then select the spectrum policy to be executed, or go to a "policy<br>
wizard" to set up a policy and actions to be taken for that type of alert. An example<br>
of a p'olicy wizard is information that simplifies the task of creating spectrum<br>
policies by asking the user (or administrator) a set of questions. Based on this<br>
information, the policy wizard generates spectrum policies and associated actions<br>
appropriate for those parameters. A policy wizard is described in more detail<br>
hereinafter. The recommended actions in step 2017 may be suggestions other than<br>
changing an operational parameter of a device or a network, as described<br>
hereinafter in conjunction with FIG. 26.<br>
FIGs. 16 through 25 illustrate output of an exemplary graphical user<br>
interface (GUI) application useful for interfacing spectrum activity and<br>
management information to/from a user. The GUI provides a means to monitor,<br>
configure and analyze the various components of the spectrum management<br>
system. It interacts with other components of the spectrum management system via<br>
the NSI referred to above in conjunction with FIG. 6.<br>
The GUI application may be written in JavaÂ® and may use sockets over<br>
TCP, for example, to communicate with the spectrum activity information<br>
associated with a particular radio communication device. The GUI application<br>
software loads a PE.ini file at initialization that contains all the configuration<br><br>
related information like hostname and the port number. Once the communication is<br>
established the application will spawn and thread which will wait on the port to<br>
detect spectrum activity information messages coming from the source device. As<br>
information comes through the socket it is processed and displayed to the various<br>
components that are detecting these messages. The message dispatcher dispatches<br>
the processed messages to appropriate display panels. All the messages coming<br>
through the socket will also be stored in a log file located in a directory specified<br>
by the user in the PE.ini against the key PELOGS. The GUI application is fed by<br>
data from the measurement engine and the classification engine referred to above in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 6.<br>
The GUI consists of several sub-parts:<br>
Fault Management. Provides a means to detect, receive and provide fault<br>
information. The fault information describes the cause of the fault.<br>
Configuration Management. Provides a means to configure the spectrum<br>
components. A spectrum advisor provides configuration related information and<br>
guides the user through the configuration process.<br>
Performance Management. Monitors traffic of a communication protocol,<br>
such as an IEEE 802.11 network, and collects statistical information indicative of<br>
spectrum utilization and displays them.<br>
Event Management. Provides a means to monitor various spectrum events<br>
and display this information in the form of graphs and histograms.<br>
FIG. 16 shows how an alert may be generated when interference is detected,<br>
wherein the alert is displayed in an icon on a GUI bar. A user clicks that icon for<br>
more information and gets to the spectrum management console window in FIG.<br>
17. In the spectrum management tab, there may be icons representing signals types<br>
that are being detected and classified in the frequency band, as well as textual<br>
information identifying those devices. In addition, there may be a sub-window<br>
that displays a "capacity rating" for the frequency band, indicating how much<br>
capacity in the frequency band is available based on the types of devices and traffic<br>
currently in use in the frequency band. The capacity rating may be derived from<br>
the "Quality" measurement reported above as a spectrum analyzer statistic, and is a<br>
qualitative estimate of the carrying capacity of the entire frequency band.<br><br>
By clicking on the "Event Log" button on the spectrum management<br>
console window in FIG. 17, the event log screen of FIG. 18 is displayed. The<br>
events log displays event information in a tabular format for all the RF events that<br>
the SAGE, measurement engine and classification engine have detected. Each<br>
event has associated with it fields including an event message, event data and time,<br>
event time stamp, event ID and event source ED, similar to the fields of the NSI<br>
spectrum event message described above:<br>
The Alert Level, ranging from Low to High to Severe, indicates how much<br>
interference the event may cause for 802.11 communications.<br>
The Type of event includes, "Interferer" (for example, a signal that may<br>
interfere with IEEE 802.11 communications), "Information" and "Error".<br>
A specific Message describing the event.<br>
The Date &amp; Time of the event. This is the date and time is filled in by the<br>
application (i.e., the Event Log software), based on the computer's internal clock.<br>
A Time Stamp in seconds and microseconds, indicating the time when the<br>
event occurred, counting from when testing first began. This data is provided by<br>
the measurement engine (from the SAGE).<br>
The ID indicates the device type, and a table below provides a partial list of<br>
IDs.<br><br>
For example, a display value of 7 is the same as ([011] [1]), meaning a<br>
Bluetooth Headset was turned on. 8 ([100] [0]) means an Infant Monitor was just<br>
turned off.<br>
The Source ID identifies the target source. This parameter is only<br>
significant when more than one source (Access Point or STA) is feeding data to the<br>
application program.<br>
More detailed information is displayed about a particular event by clicking<br>
on an event row which will open up a dialog. This dialog contains detailed<br><br>
information about the event in the form of a text area containing a description of<br>
the event and a text area containing details of the event. Examples of detailed<br>
event dialogs are shown in FIGs. 19 and 20. FIG. 19 illustrates exemplary<br>
spectrum event summary information after an action was executed according to a<br>
spectrum policy. The detailed event information indicates the action that was<br>
automatically taken according to a process similar to that shown in FIG. 14. By<br>
contrast, FIG. 20 shows event information in which an action was not automatically<br>
taken, rather a recommendation to the user is made in the detail text box that<br>
suggests how a user may avoid interference with another device detected in the<br>
frequency band, according to a process similar to that shown in FIG. 15.<br>
FIG. 21 shows a display of statistical information, such as traffic statistics<br>
for a particular communication protocol, e.g., IEEE 802.11, which may include<br>
enhanced statistics some of which are described above.<br>
FIGs. 22-25 illustrate exemplary screens in the graphs panel used to display<br>
spectrum activity information. The graphs panel consists of the graphs or plots on<br>
the right of the screen and plot type on the left tree view. When the tree view is<br>
opened and any plot type is clicked, the corresponding plot will be added and<br>
displayed on the right side. Any plot on the right side of the screen can be removed<br>
by clicking on the close icon on the plot. As soon as the "Start" button is hit and<br>
data is available on the socket the spectrum analyzer plots will be plotted. If the<br>
"Stop" button is pressed the plotting action is disabled and the spectrum analyzer<br>
plots will no longer be updated with incoming data. The spectrum activity<br>
information is displayed on the spectrum analyzer graphs, pulse histograms and<br>
pulse plots.<br>
The spectrum analyzer graph in FIG. 22 contains spectrum analyzer power<br>
vs. frequency information, described above. The spectrum analyzer stats are shown<br>
in FIG. 23 and include the spectrum analyzer stats graph, the duty cycle graph, and<br>
number of peaks bar chart. This SA stats graph displays statistical data on the<br>
frequency spectrum. It is based on spectrum messages, where a single message is<br>
built from a specific number of successive FFT cycles. Typically, 40,000<br>
successive FFTs of the RF spectrum, taken over a total time of 1/10 of a second,<br>
are used to construct the statistics for a single message. A first line shows the<br><br>
average power over the sampling period (i.e., over the 40,000 FFTs, or 1/10<br>
second). A second line, which can change rapidly from 1/10 of a second to the<br>
next, represents the "maximum power per single sampling period." It shows the<br>
maximum power achieved in each of 256 frequency bins, during the 1/10 second<br>
sampling period. A third line represents the "absolute maximum power" over all<br>
messages received so far. The Duty Cycle graph shows the percentage of the time<br>
that, for a given frequency, the power in the RF spectrum is above a specified<br>
threshold.<br>
The Number of Peaks chart shows the percentage of time that there are "N"<br>
peaks in the RF spectrum. For example, if the "0" bar is hovering around 50%,<br>
then 50% of the time there are no peaks at all. If the "1" bar is hovering at around<br>
20%, then 20% of the time there is just 1 peak in the RF spectrum. If the "2" bar<br>
hovers at 5%, then 5% of the time SAGE is detecting 2 peaks in the RF spectrum.<br>
(The "9" bar is a special case: If the "9" bar is hovering at, say, 3%, then 3% of the<br>
time SAGE is seeing 9 or more peaks in the RF spectrum.<br>
FIG. 24 shows exemplary pulse histogram plots for center frequency,<br>
bandwidth, pulse duration, pulse gap, pulse power and pulse count. As soon as the<br>
"Start" button and histogram data is available on the socket the histograms will be-<br>
plotted. If the "Stop" button is pressed the plotting action is disabled and the<br>
histograms will no longer be updated with incoming data. The following types of<br>
plots are available for viewing:<br>
Center Frequency shows the distribution of the central frequencies of the<br>
pulses. The graph spans a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The actual central frequency is<br>
determined by combining the central frequency shown on the graph with the<br>
overall RF center frequency (2.4 GHz). Also, both ends of the graph are typically<br>
flat, since the actual bandwidth captured by the radio is 83 MHz.<br>
Bandwidth shows the distribution of the bandwidths of the pulses.<br>
Pulse Duration shows the distribution of the duration of the pulses. For<br>
example, a peak at around 200 Âµsec indicates that many of the pulses persist for<br>
about 200 Âµsec.<br><br>
Pulse Gap shows the distribution of the gap times. A peak at about 1500<br>
Âµsec indicates that many of the pulses are separated in time by gaps that are about<br>
1500 Âµsec long.<br>
Pulse Power indicates the distribution of the power of the pulses.<br>
Pulse Count indicates, on a logarithmic scale, the number of pulse events<br>
counted per sample interval. Colors may be used indicate that the number of pulses<br>
poses little risk, some risk, or significant risk, for example, to a particular type of<br>
communications occurring in the radio frequency band, such as 802.11<br>
communications.<br>
FIG. 25 shows a pulse chart/plot for various pulses detected in the<br>
frequency band. When the "Capture" button is selected, the GUI application will<br>
capture the pulses and display them on the pulse chart. Each pulse is defined in<br>
three dimensions and presents a single dot for each pulse. It is intended to show<br>
the time at which each pulse occurred (horizontal axis), the center frequency<br>
(vertical axis), and the power (the dot color). A color-coded legend may be used on<br>
the left side of the pulse chart. A zooming action can be performed by dragging the<br>
mouse on a specified area in the plot below the area to be zoomed, in order to<br>
magnify that area.<br>
FIG. 26 is flow chart depicting another example of a spectrum management<br>
support tool process 5000 that can be used on a client device to debug certain<br>
spectrum conditions that may be detected on the client device, e.g., STA. The<br>
processing referred to herein may be performed at the client device, or at a<br>
processing device remote from the client device. The process 5000 may be<br>
initiated by a user command to check the performance behavior of a device on<br>
demand, through a suitable user interface application, or by an application program<br>
that periodically checks the performance behavior of the device, or in response to<br>
detecting a performance degradation, as described hereinafter. Initially, in step<br>
5010 the device monitors bit error rate (BER) or PER and other spectrum activity<br>
information (derived from a component like the SAGE referred to above). If the<br>
spectrum activity is high or the BER or PER is high it is noted in step 5020, and in<br>
step 5030, the device may compute a signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR)<br>
and perform further spectrum analysis using output from the SAGE. Based on the<br><br>
information computed up to this point, the device can in step 5040 determine the<br>
cause of degradation as either interference or low signal level.<br>
If the cause is determined to be low signal level, then a series of user<br>
recommendations are made, together with further analysis to see if the signal level<br>
returns to adequate levels once the actions are carried out by the user. For<br>
example, in step 5050, the device user is notified of the weak (receive) signal. In<br>
step 5060, local actions are recommended to the user to improve signal level, such<br>
as adjusting the antennas of the device or the location of the device. If it is then<br>
determined in step 5070 that the adjustments returned the signal level to adequate<br>
conditions, then the process terminates. Steps 5060 and 5070 may be repeated<br>
several times (m iterations). If those user adjustments still do not help the signal<br>
level, then in step 5080, additional actions are recommended to be taken at the<br>
other device on the link, such as an AP. These recommended actions may include<br>
adjusting the antennas at the AP or the location of the AP. In step 5090, it is again<br>
determined whether signal level at the device is at an adequate level. If not, the<br>
process continues to step 5100 in which the user is notified of an inability to sustain<br>
a reliable link, and additional recommendations may include reducing or removing<br>
obstructions between the two devices, and reducing the range/distance between the<br>
two devices.<br>
If in step 5040 the cause is determined to be interference, then a series of<br>
steps are perfonned. First, in step 5110, the interference is classified, by signal<br>
type, etc. Moreover, if in step 5120 it is determined that the interferer is a type<br>
that can be mitigated using interference mitigation techniques, then the device<br>
executes those techniques automatically (which may involve cooperation with<br>
and/or action by other devices, such as an AP). Examples of interference<br>
mitigation techniques are referred to above. If the interferer is one that cannot be<br>
automatically mitigated, then a variety of other actions are recommended to the<br>
user. In step 5140, the user is notified that an interference conditions has been<br>
detected. If in step 5150 the interference is a type that is known, then several<br>
actions to manually deal with the interference are recommended. In step 5160, if<br>
the interference is caused by another IEEE 802.11 network on the same channel,<br>
then a recommended user action is to adjust the AP of the user's network to a<br><br>
clean/unused channel. In step 5170, if the interference is caused by an IEEE<br>
802.11 network on an adjacent channel, the recommended user actions may include<br>
adjusting the AP to a channel further from the other network's channel, adjusting<br>
the physical location of the interfering network, or adjusting the location of the AP<br>
in the user's network. In step 5180, if the interference is caused by a microwave<br>
oven, then recommended user actions may include adjusting the AP of the user's<br>
network to a cleaner channel, adjusting the location of the AP in the user's<br>
network, adjusting the fragmentation threshold of the AP in the user's network for<br>
better interoperability, or to increase the distance between the user's device and the<br>
microwave oven.<br>
Still further situations are shown in steps 5190 and 5200. In step 5190, the<br>
situation is one in which the interference is determined to be a Bluetoothâ„¢ device.<br>
The user is notified that a Bluetoothâ„¢ device (in synchronous or asynchronous<br>
operation mode) is the cause of the interference, and recommended user actions<br>
include increasing the range between the user's device and the interfering device.<br>
In step 5200, if the interference is caused by a cordless phone, a user is<br>
recommended to increase the distance between the user's device and the cordless<br>
phone base device, such as at least 5 m from the user's device or the AP in the<br>
user's network.<br>
If in step 5150, it is determined that the interferer is not known, then in step<br>
5210, the recommended user actions may include checking for recently acquired or<br>
deployed wireless equipment that may be causing interference, increasing the<br>
range/distance between equipment of incompatible networks, and advising the user<br>
about various potential network incompatibilities.<br>
FIG. 26 shows various steps that involve notifying the user with<br>
information. There are many mechanisms to notify the user, including a visual<br>
display of information, such as on a monitor with text, announcing the information<br>
in a voice-synthesized audio message, conveying the information in an audio-video<br>
segment, displaying one or more icons or symbols that represent the information to<br>
be conveyed, etc. Examples of these displays are shown in FIG. 16-20.<br><br>
Scenario 2: Secondary Usage<br>
Secondary usage refers to allowing devices to make use of "fallow"<br>
licensed spectrum. This is not just a futuristic scenario. It already exists in the<br>
case of 802.11a in Europe. At 5 GHz, radar is considered the primary user, and<br>
802.11 a is a secondary user. Current implementations simply quiesce the network<br>
and look for RSSI. Simple RSSI measurement and DFS are not enough to<br>
enable secondary use. The "pecking order" between primary and secondary users<br>
requires a different response to noise depending on whether it is from a primary or<br>
another secondary user. By detecting and classifying signals, a differentiation is<br>
made between radar and other spectrum users faster and with few false detections<br>
than techniques based on RSSI and allows for selecting a new channel that is not<br>
affected by the radar for the traffic.<br>
In order to be a secondary user, the following occurs:<br>
Measurement: Pause periodically to check for the presence of primary<br>
users.<br>
Classification: Distinguish between primary users, and other secondary<br>
users.<br>
Policy: Determine how long and how often to measure, and how to respond<br>
when a primary user is detected.<br>
Scenario 3: High QoS In the Presence of an Interfering Signal or Noise<br>
An 802.1 la network carries a video stream. Background noise is causing a<br>
problem with packet loss. Assume that the AP in the network has multi-channel<br>
capability.<br>
The best solution is achieved by measuring and classifying the noise, and<br>
using a different policy depending on the interfering signal. With reference to FIG.<br>
27, a first case is shown (Case 1), where the noise is background hum, uniform in<br>
time. The policy associated with this case may be to use a spatial processing<br>
. algorithm to improve the link margin between two devices. Examples of spatial<br>
processing algorithm are disclosed in commonly assigned and co-pending U.S.<br>
Application Nos. 10/174,728 filed June 19, 2002, entitled "System and Method for<br>
Antenna Diversity Using Joint Maximal Ratio Combining"; 10/174,689 filed June<br>
19, 2002, entitled "System and Method for Antenna Diversity Using Equal Power<br><br>
Joint Maximal Ratio Combining"; and 10/064,482, filed July 18, 2002, entitled<br>
"System and Method for Joint Maximal Ratio Combining Using Time-Domain<br>
Signal Processing."<br>
In Case 2, the interference is caused by a slow frequency hopping signal.<br>
The policy associated with this case would be to use redundant channels to reduce<br>
packet error rate.<br>
In Case 3, the interference is caused by a fast frequency hopping signal.<br>
The policy associated with this case would be to use a rate lA code across a wider<br>
bandwidth channel to reduce packet error rate.<br>
Scenario 4: Finding a Channel in a Dense Environment<br>
In a sparsely-used environment, it may suffice to simply search for a<br>
channel with no interference. This is the easy case.<br>
But in a densely-used environment, a device could easily find that no<br>
channel is available with zero interference.<br>
In this case, one approach might be to accept a channel with the "lowest"<br>
interference. If a new network must compete with another spectrum user, the<br>
optimal channel selection algorithm should consider, for example:<br>
What are the priorities of the various networks?<br>
Which networks might the new network function cooperatively with?<br>
For example, the IEEE 802.11 specification is designed such that two 802.11<br>
networks can share a channel reasonably, whereby each network gets allocated a<br>
part of the bandwidth. Making this kind of decision in the most optimal way<br>
requires measurement, classification and policy capabilities.<br>
Scenario 5: 802.11 in the Presence of Bluetooth<br>
A Bluetoothâ„¢ signal is a frequency hopping signal. It therefore can cause<br>
periodic interference with, for example, an AP for an IEEE 802.11 network that<br>
uses a fixed channel. In order to work cooperatively with Bluetoothâ„¢, an IEEE<br>
802.11 network may perform measurement and classification to determine the<br>
presence of the Bluetoothâ„¢ network.<br>
Once Bluetooth is detected, several policies may be invoked:<br>
Policy la: If Bluetooth is using synchronous (SCO) traffic, schedule any<br>
802.11 QoS packets so that they occur between the timing of the SCO packets.<br><br>
Several techniques are described in the aforementioned co-pending and commonly<br>
assigned patent applications.<br>
Policy 1b: If Bluetooth is using SCO traffic, do not transmit during the<br>
SCO periods.<br>
Policy 2: Attempt to minimize the effect of receive interference from<br>
Bluetooth by adjusting a steerable antenna.<br>
Policy 3: Do not shift to a lower data rate in response to packet errors. This<br>
may only exacerbate the problem. Experiments have shown that when exposed to<br>
the interference of a Bluetooth frequency-hopping signal, an IEEE 802.11b device<br>
detects an "increase in its error rate" and responds by decreasing its over-the-air<br>
transmission rate. Decreasing its transmission rate does not necessarily help and<br>
when the IEEE 802.11b device continues to detect an unacceptably high (or<br>
potentially higher) error rate, it further reduces its data rate. This action is<br>
compliant with the IEEE 802.11 standard, and yet is patently unintelligent. The<br>
device effectively increases its exposure to a frequency hopper by increasing the<br>
duration of its packet through the reduction in over-the-air data rate. While it is true<br>
that standards bodies may improve coexistence between open standard protocols in<br>
these types of situations, this type of degradation in performance could be<br>
minimized or even avoided completely, by the deployment of the cognitive<br>
spectrum management technologies described herein.<br>
Scenario 6: Bluetooth in the Presence of 802.11<br>
In order to work cooperatively with 802.11, a Bluetooth network should<br>
perform measurement and classification to determine the presence of 802.11<br>
networks. Once an 802.11 network has been detected, a policy can be invoked:<br>
Policy 1: No Adaptive Hop Sets Supported for a Bluetoothâ„¢ Network<br>
In this case, the Bluetooth network should avoid generating interference<br>
with 802.11 by idling slots where the 802.11 data or ACK would occur. An<br>
example of this technique is disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020061031.<br>
The Bluetoothâ„¢ network will only want to use this algorithm when a "real" data<br>
network is present, as opposed to just a noise source. This justifies the benefit of<br>
signal classification over simple RSSI measurements.<br>
Policy 2: Adaptive Hop Sets Supported for a Bluetoothâ„¢ Network<br><br>
In this case, the Bluetooth network should remove hops that enter the<br>
802.11 band. One known proposal in 802.15.2 suggests using lost packets to<br>
identify the presence of a foreign network. This is not always effective.<br>
Interference is not always symmetric (i.e., the Bluetooth network may be causing a<br>
problem with another network, but the other network is not interfering with the<br>
Bluetooth network). In addition, this would require losing packets before another<br>
network is detected.<br>
Scenario 7: DRA in the Presence of a Frequency Hopping Signal<br>
A Dynamic Rate Adapting (DRA) device uses more spectrum when it is<br>
available, and less when it is not available. For example, the increased spectrum<br>
may be used for higher data rate, QoS, etc. DRA can be implemented as a new<br>
protocol (e.g., "bed-of-nails" orthogonal frequency division multiplex systems), or<br>
by aggregating multiple standard channels.<br>
The question arises, however, as to how should DRA deal with frequency<br>
hopping protocols. One solution is that in order to deal politely with a frequency<br>
hopping signal, a DRA device must detect the hopper via measurement and<br>
classification. Once the hopper has been classified, then policies can be invoked.<br>
Exemplary situations are as follows:<br>
Policy 1: If a frequency hopping signal is detected, limit the DRA to 50%<br>
of the band, so that the frequency hopping network can still operate.<br>
Policy 2: If the frequency hopping network adapts its hop set in response<br>
(observed by a measurement), then DRA can be allowed to use 75% of the band.<br>
Scenario 8: Device Specific Policies<br>
In a consumer environment, users may want to define priorities among<br>
specific devices. For example, at home, users may want to establish a "pecking<br>
order" between cordless phone, streaming video, WLAN, etc. In order to allow for<br>
policies at the specific device level, it will be necessary for devices to measure and<br>
classify other operating devices. Devices can be taught to recognize each other, by<br>
directly exchanging classification information, or by using "training" modes similar<br>
to universal remote controls. Unrecognized devices may be handled with various<br>
policies:<br>
In an office environment, report immediately.<br><br>
In a home environment, treat the situation as a low priority.<br>
Scenario 9: Context Specific Policies<br>
Some policies will be dependent on context information such as location,<br>
time of day, etc.<br>
These policies may be updateable, since they are heavily dependent on the<br>
desires of the user.<br>
Network selection:<br>
In a home environment, always use a particular basic service station<br>
identifier, e.g., BSSID 7.<br>
In an office environment, use the lowest CCA between BSSID 23, 27.<br>
In a public access environment (e.g., an airport), use the BSSID that offers<br>
the lowest per-minute access charge.<br>
Traffic prioritization:<br>
During morning hours, prioritize WLAN download traffic.<br>
During evening hours, prioritize video streaming data.<br>
A policy wizard can be used to allow unsophisticated users to create<br>
complex policies.<br>
Scenario 10: Regulatory Specific Policies<br>
In order to follow the regulatory requirements of various countries, different<br>
policies may be required.<br>
These policies should be downloadable, since there will be a lot of them,<br>
and<br>
they will change over time.<br>
The European Communication Commission (ECC) may impose uniform<br>
spreading requirement on channel selection algorithms for 802.11a. There may be<br>
different transmit power, band and channel requirements by country.<br>
Scenario 11: Dynamic Frequency Selection<br>
Dynamic frequency selection may be useful in a situation where a non-<br>
WLAN signal is interfering with a particular WLAN frequency channel. For<br>
example, and with reference to FIG. 1, the WLAN STA1 1030(1) (e.g., a laptop<br>
computer having a 802.11 network interface card (NIC)) is exchanging data with<br>
the server 1055 through one of the WLAN APs 1050(1) to 1050(N). The infant<br><br>
monitor transmitter 1060 is turned on in the same frequency channel that the AP<br>
1050(1) is using to exchange data with the STA1030(1). A spectrum sensor 1200<br>
(or a cognitively- enabled-AP) generates spectrum activity information that is<br>
supplied to the network management station 1090. The AP 1050(1) may supply<br>
802.11 network statistics. Based on the 802.11 network statistics, the network<br>
management station 1090 will detect that the AP 1050(1) cannot get a clear channel<br>
access (CCA) to the channel. The network management station 1090 may analyze<br>
the spectrum activity information supplied by the spectrum sensor 1200 or the AP<br>
1050 to find another clear channel in the frequency band. The network<br>
management station 1090 may then reassign the AP 1050(1) to a clear channel.<br>
The AP 1050(1) will begin transmitting beacons on the new clear channel. The<br>
STA 1030(1) will eventually turn to scanning the channels to acquire the beacon on<br>
the new clear channel and 802.11 traffic with the AP 1050(1) will resume on the<br>
new clear channel. If a certain part of the frequency band is in constant use by<br>
other devices, another device or network can be programmed or controlled on-the-<br>
fly to not transmit over those bandwidths. Conversely, by deliberately searching<br>
for "clean" channels, devices or networks can be controlled to broadcast over those<br>
channels.<br>
Scenario 12: Adjusting Packet Size<br>
Pulse histograms may indicate the duration of gaps between detected signal<br>
pulses. If the gaps are very short, devices or a network of devices can be<br>
programmed, once again "on-the-fly", to decrease the size of packets to fit within<br>
the available time gaps between pulses. This reduces the chances that single<br>
packets will experience interference, and so reduces the need to retransmit packets.<br>
Of course, when the gaps between pulses become longer, the packet size can be<br>
increased again, resulting in higher transmission speeds.<br>
The foregoing scenarios illustrate the advantage of gathering intelligence<br>
about use of the spectrum and using that information. Smart data rate selection is<br>
another example of how an intelligent system has advantages over current systems,<br>
in which there is no direct information about interference, for example. Without<br>
knowledge about interference, it is difficult to distinguish between problems caused<br>
by interference, packet errors or hidden nodes. As a result, current systems<br><br>
implement "best-guess" algorithms that are often counter-productive. An example<br>
is an 802.1 lb response to the presence of a frequency hopping signal, such as a<br>
Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO. The initial 802.11b response is to back-off on the data rate,<br>
which in turn causes more collisions, which 802.1 lb responds to with further rate<br>
back-off, etc. By contrast, the system described above uses signal classification<br>
and other interference timing information to make intelligent decisions on data rate.<br>
Furthermore, current systems use static pre-defined packet fragmentation<br>
levels, and also have no information about the timing of an interfering signal. The<br>
intelligent spectrum management system allows for the optimization of<br>
fragmentation levels and packet scheduling in response to interference patterns.<br>
More Detailed Spectrum Management System Architecture<br>
Referring to FIG. 28, a diagram of a spectrum management system<br>
architecture is shown that is similar to the one shown in FIG. 6, but splits some<br>
functions of measurement, classification and spectrum actions or controls into<br>
multiple layers. The processing levels are:<br>
1). L0 : Hardware Management Services 100<br>
2)	L1 : Engine Management Services 200<br>
3)	L2 : Managers Services 300<br>
4)	APP : Applications Services 400<br>
To compare with the diagram of FIG. 6, level L0 corresponds to the hardware or<br>
physical layer level and the drivers that sit above the hardware level; level L1<br>
corresponds to the spectrum level; and level L2 corresponds to the network level.<br>
The top layer, APP, corresponds to the UI block, systems integration block and<br>
other systems or applications that the systems integration block integrated with.<br>
L0 : Hardware Management Services<br>
The L0 hardware management services 100 manages the hardware<br>
resources 10 used in the spectrum management system. These hardware resources<br>
reside in a communication device that is operating in a frequency band shared by<br>
other devices and communication devices. Management of hardware resources<br>
includes management of a radio (radio transceiver or receiver) 12 on the basis of<br><br>
contention management, and traffic data accumulation, to be described further<br>
hereinafter, and of the SAGE 20.<br>
In the L0 hardware management services level 100, there are a L0 resource<br>
manager 110, a LO SAGE engine 120 that manages the SAGE 20 and a L0<br>
measurement engine 130. The L0 hardware management services may be executed<br>
"on-chip," meaning on the integrated circuits (ICs) that are included in the<br>
communication device to process signals for transmissions and reception in the<br>
network. This processing level may apply similarly to all communication devices<br>
operating in a network.<br>
The L0 SAGE engine 120 is a device driver to interface higher level<br>
commands with the SAGE 20, and translate those commands into signals that the<br>
SAGE 20 can recognize. Commands may include configuration signals for one or<br>
more components of the SAGE 20, described hereinafter.<br>
The L0 measurement engine 130 performs an initial accumulation of data<br>
output by the SAGE 20 into a spectrum utilization map (SUM) format. The<br>
spectrum utilization map will be described in hereinafter.<br>
L1 : Engine Services<br>
The L1 engine services level 200 is where the first level measurement,<br>
classification, location, and policy services execute. In the engine services level,<br>
there are L1 engines, such as a L1 location engine 210, L1 measurement engine<br>
220, L1 classification engine 230 and L1 policy engine 240 that control the L0<br>
hardware management level processes and use the information to perform their<br>
next level services. There is also a L1 resource manager 250 in the engine<br>
management level 200. A protocol coordination engine 260 resides in the L1<br>
engine services level 200, and it performs functions related to protocol<br>
management; it does not play a vital role in spectrum management.<br>
The L1 engine services level 200 is normally performed "off-chip," that is<br>
in a host processor of the communication device. However some L1 processing<br>
could be performed on-chip if additional external memory is supported. Some<br>
local policy decisions, such as local interference mitigation, may be decided at the<br>
L1 Engine processing level. The L1 engine services level may apply similarly to<br>
all communication devices operating in the network.<br><br>
L2 : Manager Services Level<br>
The next higher level is the L2 manager services level 300. The L2<br>
manager services are responsible for more complex network spectrum management<br>
functions. Examples of processes at this level are the L2 location manager 310, L2<br>
measurement manager 320, L2 classification manager 330 and L2 policy manager<br>
340. There are also a L2 resource manager 350 and a L2 network spectrum<br>
manager 360. The processing at this level may be performed at a central server<br>
location which consolidates the information for processing, and not necessarily by<br>
a communication device operating in the network.<br>
Other software functions that may reside at this level include a database<br>
function with report and query services to analyze spectrum activity information<br>
collected from the lower processing levels, security policies, interference policies,<br>
management information base (MIB), web server, SNMP Agent, SendMail, etc.<br>
APP : Applications Services Level<br>
The highest level in the system architecture is the APP applications services<br>
level 400 where the network applications execute. Examples of network include a<br>
spectrum analyzer display application 410, a location/map display application 420,<br>
a measurement/statistics application 430 and a spectrum management policy<br>
application 440.<br>
Referring to FIG. 29, from the perspective of spectrum management a<br>
network may comprise devices such as stations STAs 500, access points APs 510,<br>
an overseeing network spectrum manager 360 and applications services 400. An<br>
instance of a network spectrum manager 360 is responsible for a subnet consisting<br>
of APs 510 and their associated STAs 500. While the terms STA and AP are used<br>
herein, which have relevance to IEEE 802.11x WLAN applications, it should be<br>
understood that the spectrum management architecture and processes described<br>
herein may apply to any wireless communication application. The network<br>
spectrum manager 360, as mentioned above, may reside on a server computer (e.g.,<br>
network managing station 1090 in FIG. 1) coupled by wire or wireless link to the<br>
APs within its subnet. In many cases, the subnet is in fact the entire network in<br>
question.<br><br>
Spectrum management is designed to work in cooperation with parallel<br>
foreign network management entities. For example, a general network<br>
management system might be in place for enabling, disabling, and configuring<br>
network components such as APs. The network spectrum manager has a service<br>
interface that permits notification of such changes by a foreign network<br>
management system. Similarly, spectrum management provides a service interface<br>
so that a general network management system may be notified of changes within<br>
the network such as channel assignments and STA associations. This network<br>
update service interface may be used by any conforming application in the<br>
application services 400.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 28, examples of spectrum management services<br>
include location, measurement, classification, and policy management. Policy<br>
management configures and initiates algorithms governing co-existence among<br>
communication devices of different types operating in the frequency band, channel<br>
assignment of devices in the frequency band, transmit power control of devices<br>
operating in the frequency band and bandwidth allocated to devices operating in the<br>
frequency band.<br>
Most spectrum management services are independent of specific media<br>
access protocols. For example, spectrum analysis, classification, radio<br>
measurements, and some policies are protocol independent. In addition to these<br>
protocol independent services, spectrum management also provides some protocol<br>
specific support, such as support for traffic statistics associated with a particular<br>
medium access protocol, such as IEEE 802.11x and co-existence algorithms.<br>
However, the overall spectrum management architecture may be applied to any<br>
frequency band, such as the ISM unlicensed bands in the United States and<br>
unlicensed bands in other jurisdictions around the world.<br>
The Network Spectrum Interfaces (NSIs)<br>
Turning to FIG. 30, there are multiple NSI APIs in connection with the<br>
architecture of FIG. 28. There are:<br>
1) a Hardware NSI 170 that interfaces the L0 hardware management<br>
services 100 to the L1 engine management services 200;<br><br>
2)	an Engine NSI 270 that interfaces the L1 engine management<br>
services 200 to the L2 manager services 300. The Engine NSI 270 is analogous to<br>
the NSI referred to in FIG. 6; and<br>
3)	a Manager NSI 370 that interfaces the L2 manager services 300 to<br>
the applications services 400.<br>
The NSI is a logical interface which is embodied in a variety of program<br>
interfaces and transport mechanisms, and may employ any suitable transport<br>
mechanism. This primarily affects the Hardware NSI 170. For example, if the L0<br>
hardware management services executes on-chip and the L1 engine management<br>
services executes within a host device driver, the transport mechanism for the<br>
Hardware NSI may be over a PCI interface, for example. On the other hand, if the<br>
L0 hardware management services executes on-chip alongside the L1 engine<br>
management services, then the transport may be a local (on-chip) software<br>
interface. In either case the Hardware NSI service model would be the same.<br>
FIG. 31 shows how the NSIs are used between the various levels of the<br>
spectrum management software architecture in the context of the system hierarchy<br>
shown in FIG. 28. For each of the NSIs, there is an application programming<br>
interface (API) that defines the transport protocol for that interface. At the highest<br>
level in the spectrum management architecture, there is an NSI manager services<br>
API 372 that defines how information is exchanged between the L2 manager<br>
services 300 and the applications services 400. The NSI manager services API 372<br>
of any subnet may interface with L2 manager services of the same subnet and other<br>
subnets. At the next level down, there is a NSI engine services API 272 that<br>
defines how information is exchanged between the L2 manager services 300 and<br>
the L1 engine services 200 executing in APs for that subnet. There is an NSI<br>
hardware API 172 that defines how information is exchanged between the L1<br>
engine management services 200 and the L0 hardware management services 100 in<br>
each AP.<br>
At the STA network level, there also is a NSI hardware API 174 that<br>
defines the information exchange between the L0 hardware management services<br>
100 in a STA with the L1 engine management services 200 in the STA. Similarly,<br>
there is a NSI engine services API 274 that defines the information exchange<br><br>
between the L1 engine management services 200 and the applications services 400<br>
in the STA.<br>
The Resource Managers<br>
Referring to FIG. 32, the resource manager function will be described.<br>
Within each network component at each level of the spectrum management<br>
software architecture is a resource manager. The resource manager is responsible<br>
for (1) mediating contention for common resources (such as the radio transceiver<br>
and SAGE) between software components at the same level; and (2) requesting<br>
access to common lower level resources; and (3) responding to requests from upper<br>
levels to schedule services by that level. Where possible the resource manager will<br>
already have knowledge and complete control over the scheduling of use of the<br>
lower level resource. However there may be occasions when the lower level will<br>
need to be consulted as to when a lower resource has become available. Once a<br>
service request has been granted the upper layer components will generally interact<br>
directly with the lower layer counterparts. When coordination of resources is<br>
required across a network, the L2 network spectrum manager 360 coordinates the<br>
various resource managers involved.<br>
Turning to FIG. 33, spectrum management is involved with the scheduling<br>
and co-ordination of resources that are required to deliver spectrum management<br>
services such as classification, location, and measurement. Spectrum intelligence<br>
is the transformation of raw data into higher level information content for the<br>
intelligent use of that information.<br>
The software components involved in managing network resources are the<br>
resource managers in each software level and the L2 network spectrum manager<br>
360. The L2 network spectrum manager 360 manages resources across the<br>
network. It is essentially the master of network control. The network updates<br>
service interface 450 is an application service that manages update requests that can<br>
come from foreign network management systems or other upper layer applications.<br>
These requests are fielded by the L2 network spectrum manager 360 and may have<br>
effects across the network.<br><br>
The L0 and L1 resource managers 110 and 250, respectively, are only<br>
responsible for managing resource requests within their own network component<br>
(STA or AP). The L2 resource manager manages cross network resource requests.<br>
However it does not manage any activities. It is essentially manages the inventory<br>
of resources that the L2 network spectrum manager 360 controls.<br>
For each MAC protocol that is actively managed by L2 network spectrum<br>
manager 360, there is an L1 protocol coordination engine 260 (FIG. 28) which<br>
manages the actual protocol MAC engine.<br>
The software components shown in FIG. 33 control network activities, but<br>
they do not make intelligent choices as to what actions to take. These intelligent<br>
decisions are either made by the policy engines/managers or by an application in<br>
the applications services level 400.<br>
Referring to FIG. 34, the concept of spectrum intelligence is further<br>
described. Spectrum intelligence manifests itself in two general categories:<br>
intelligent spectrum information 600 and intelligent spectrum control 620.<br>
Intelligent spectrum information 600 is the result of converting raw spectrum<br>
activity data into increasingly higher information content. For example, the L0<br>
SAGE engine 120 captures pulse events which are analyzed by the L1<br>
classification engine 230 which in turn passes the pre-processed results to the L2<br>
classification manager 330 for further analysis when necessary.<br>
Intelligent spectrum control 620 are the commands that are generated<br>
which, when acted upon, change the behavior of a device operating in the<br>
frequency band that impacts the usage of the frequency band. The L1 policy<br>
engine 240 and L2 policy manager 340 are the primary mechanisms for intelligent<br>
response to network conditions. The actions include AP channel selection, STA<br>
load balancing, and interference mitigation (co-existence algorithms), etc. In<br>
addition the Manager NSI 370 (FIG. 30) provides a policy manager service<br>
interface which allows higher level network applications to update or influence<br>
policies.<br>
FIGs. 35 and 36 show more details about the interaction between modules<br>
in the different levels of the spectrum management system. In these diagrams,<br>
solid lines between blocks represent data flow and dashed lines represent controls.<br><br>
FIG. 35 shows the interface of information between the L0 hardware<br>
management services and the hardware resources, and the interface of information<br>
by the hardware NSI between the L0 hardware management services and the L1<br>
engine services. The L0 resource manager 110 manages use of the radio resources<br>
to prevent conflicting uses of the radio. For example, the L0 resource manager 110<br>
may receive requests from the L1 resource manager for performing a spectrum<br>
management task, such as changing a center frequency, bandwidth or power, or for<br>
SAGE function/control requests. The L0 resource manager 110 will generate<br>
control signals to control center frequency, bandwidth and/or output power level<br>
used by the radio, and will arbitrate use of the radio between a MAC protocol<br>
process 140 for receiving or transmitting signals and SAGE requests. For example,<br>
when transmitting and/or receiving signals according to a MAC protocol, L0<br>
resource manager 110 will set the bandwidth of the radio to operate in a<br>
narrowband mode whereby the radio downconverts only a portion of the frequency<br>
band (where a signal is expected to be present) or upconvert to only a portion of the<br>
frequency band where a signal is to be transmitted and the protocol sequencer 150<br>
will have use of the radio. On the other hand, when operating the SAGE 20, the<br>
L0 resource manager 110 will control the radio to operate in a wideband mode to<br>
sample the entire or substantial portions of the frequency band for spectrum<br>
management functions, or to transmit a wideband signal in the frequency band.<br>
Based on the received request, the L0 resource manager 110 will set the duration of<br>
use of the radio for SAGE or signal communication functions.<br>
The L0 SAGE engine 120 provides device driver, configuration and<br>
interface management for the SAGE 20. These responsibilities include utilization<br>
of the SAGE Dual Port Ram (DPR). The SAGE Dual Port Ram is used by several<br>
SAGE internal components. The L0 SAGE Engine 120 is responsible for assigning<br>
DPR resources to the various applications and refusing request when the DPR<br>
resources are not currently available. The L0 SAGE engine 120 transfers SAGE<br>
information to other L0 subsystems, such as to the L0 measurement engine 130 or<br>
off-chip to the L1 classification engine 230.<br>
The L0 SAGE engine 120 receives configuration information for several of<br>
its components from L1 engines. For example, it receives configuration<br><br>
information for the snapshot buffer from the L1 location engine 210, and upon an<br>
appropriate triggering event, supplied snapshot buffer content to the L1 location<br>
engine 210. Similarly, the L0 SAGE engine 120 receives SAGE signal detector<br>
configuration information from the L1 classification engine 230. The L0 SAGE<br>
engine 120 outputs signal detector pulse events to the L1 classification engine 230.<br>
The L1 policy engine 240 provides controls for the USS component of the SAGE<br>
20.<br>
The L1 measurement engine 220 exchanges configuration information for<br>
the SAGE spectrum analyzer and signal detector with the L0 measurement engine<br>
130. In addition, the L0 measurement engine outputs pulse events from the SAGE<br>
signal detector, as well as stats and duty cycle information from the SAGE<br>
spectrum analyzer. The L0 measurement engine 120 accumulates this information<br>
which constitutes the initial information for the spectrum utilization map (SUM).<br>
At this level, this information is referred to as the L0 SUM 160. The L0 SUM 160<br>
may be periodically passed off-chip to the L1 SUM 265 and to the L1 measurement<br>
engine 220 for accumulation into the L2 SUM.<br>
The L1 measurement engine 220 provides to L2 managers power versus<br>
frequency (PF) spectrogram information and spectrum analyzer statistics generated<br>
by the spectrum analyzer of the SAGE 20, as well as pulse events output by the<br>
SAGE signal detector. The L1 measurement engine 130 may receive SAGE<br>
spectrum analyzer configuration information from the L2 measurement manager<br>
320 to configure such things as a lowpass filter parameter, decimation factor, etc.<br>
The L1 measurement engine 220 outputs a timestamp and associated received<br>
signal strength indicator (RSSI) power values for each of a plurality of Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT) bins. For the spectrum analyzer statistics, the spectrum analyzer<br>
of the SAGE 20 may similarly be configured as to a lowpass filter parameter,<br>
decimation factor, cycle counter (number of spectrum analyzer updates performed<br>
prior to forwarding the stats) and minimum power for duty counting. The spectrum<br>
analyzer stats include a timestamp and associated stats for each FFT bin, including<br>
average power, maximum power and number of time above a minimum power.<br>
Pulse events are output by the pulse detector components of the SAGE<br>
signal detector. The SAGE contains, for example, four pulse detectors. The L1<br><br>
measurement engine 220 collects pulse events. More than one L4 user may use the<br>
same stream of pulse events. For example, the L2 classification manager 330 may<br>
use the pulse events to perform more detailed classification. The same stream of<br>
pulse events is also examined by the L4 classification engine 230.<br>
A user of the pulse event stream may specify a specific pulse detector by<br>
specifying a signal detector ID such as, fore example, 0 to 3. Otherwise the L2<br>
network spectrum manager 360 chooses the pulse detector. The configuration<br>
information for a pulse detector includes ID, bandwidth threshold, minimum center<br>
frequency, maximum center frequency, minimum power threshold, minimum pulse<br>
bandwidth, maximum pulse bandwidth, maximum pulse duration, etc. Further<br>
details on the configuration of a pulse detector are disclosed in the aforementioned<br>
co-pending application on the SAGE.<br>
The pulse event data stream comprises, for example, an signal detector ID,<br>
center frequency (at the beginning of the pulse), pulse bandwidth (at the beginning<br>
of the pulse), pulse duration, timestamp for the start of the pulse event, counter<br>
value for a down counter in the universal clock module associated with the pulse<br>
detector and pulse power estimate (at the beginning of the pulse).<br>
The L1 classification engine 230 performs the first level of signal<br>
classification. Details of signal classification procedures are disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned commonly assigned patent application. The L1 classification<br>
engine 230 outputs fingerprint identification of a signal or pulse by matching<br>
statistical and pulse information against fingerprint templates. The result is one or<br>
more identification matches as to the type and timing of a pulse. In addition, the<br>
L1 classification engine 230 outputs statistical information that characterizes<br>
generally what is occurring in the frequency band. The L1 classification engine<br>
230 configures the SAGE pulse detectors appropriate for signal classification, as<br>
described above.<br>
The signal identification information output by the L1 classification engine<br>
230 is also called a "fingerprint identification" and includes for example, a center<br>
frequency (if relevant), fingerprint ID, estimated probability that the fingerprint ID<br>
represents the device, power of the identified device and estimated duty cycle<br>
percentage. The fingerprint ID includes for example, IDs for a microwave oven,<br><br>
frequency hopping device (such as a Bluetoothâ„¢ SCO device or a Bluetoothâ„¢<br>
ACL device, a cordless phone, an IEEE 802.11 device, and IEEE 802.15.3 device,<br>
and various types of radar signals.<br>
The classification statistical information includes histograms built from the<br>
pulse events generated by the SAGE signal detector. The L1 classification engine<br>
230 configures the pulse detector to gather the pulse events based on its<br>
configuration. Examples of statistical histograms built include center frequency,<br>
bandwidth, active transmission, pulse duration, time between pulses and<br>
autocorrelation. These histograms and the classification engine are described in<br>
further detail in the aforementioned signal classification patent application.<br>
FIG. 36 also shows the various application services and how they interface<br>
with the manager services. The L2 measurement manager 320 exchanges data with<br>
the spectrum analyzer application 410 and with the measurement/stats application<br>
430. The L2 measurement manager 320 receives SUM data from the L1<br>
measurement engine 220 and builds the complete SUM, called the L2 SUM 380.<br>
The L2 SUM 380 includes radio and protocol statistics. The L2 SUM 280 will be<br>
described in greater detail in conjunction with FIG. 41. The L2 location manager<br>
310 interfaces information with the location application 420. For example, the L2<br>
location manager 310 supplies raw location data the location application 420<br>
processes to generate location information for various devices operating in the<br>
frequency band. The L2 classification manager 330 exchanges information with a<br>
classification definition application 425. The classification definition application<br>
425 is an application that generates and supplies new or updated signal definition<br>
reference data (also called fingerprints) for use by the classification engine 230. A<br>
classification definition algorithm is disclosed in the aforementioned commonly<br>
assigned application related to signal classification. The L2 policy manager 340<br>
exchanges information with the policy application 440. One function of the policy<br>
application 400 is to define and supply spectrum policies governing use of the<br>
frequency band in certain situations. A policy wizard, described hereinafter, is an<br>
example of another function of the policy application 440.<br>
Turning to FIGs. 37-40, the interface between the L1 engines services and<br>
the L2 manager services will be described. The function of the Engine NSI is to<br><br>
provide access to the L1 engines services. As shown in FIG. 37, in a WLAN<br>
application, the L1 engine services operate within APs and Client STAs. A single<br>
instance of the Engine NSI provides access to either an AP and the STAs, or a<br>
single STA. Instances of the Engine NSI are distinguished by transport<br>
connections. That is, there a separate transport connection for each instance of the<br>
Engine NSI. In a WLAN application, the Engine NSI may be provided within both<br>
APs and STAs. Similar L1 services are provided in both the STAs and the<br>
controlling APs. For example, the output of the SAGE is provided to both APs and<br>
STAs. Similarly, network SUM/Stats are available from both the AP's and STA's<br>
perspective.<br>
With reference to FIG. 38, when an Engine NSI user wishes to access more<br>
than one AP, separate instances of the Engine NSI are created. Each instance is<br>
distinguished by a separate transport connection. FIG. 38 shows an example of a<br>
single Engine NSI user accessing two APs via two separate instances of the Engine<br>
NSI, each with its own transport connection.<br>
Turning to FIGs. 39 and 40, accessing the NS-Engine Services within a<br>
Station can be achieved either locally within the Station or remotely via a transport<br>
protocol. FIG. 39 shows local access typical of a local station management<br>
application. The STA management application provides the user services, such as<br>
SAGE spectrum analyzer or statistics. FIG. 40 shows how a remote model permits<br>
central accumulation of remote STA statistics. It also allows coordination of such<br>
activities as interference mitigation between AP, STA and interference sources.<br>
FIG. 41 shows an example of the information contained in the L2 SUM<br>
380. Each Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) frequency bin (of a plurality of frequency<br>
bins that span the frequency band) has an associated duty cycle statistic, maximum<br>
power statistic, average power statistic, and network traffic statistic, if any. FIG.<br>
41 shows only an exemplary sub-set of the frequency bins.<br>
The L2 Policy Manager<br>
The policy manager 340 defines how to react to the presence of other<br>
signals in the frequency band. These policies may be dictated by regulatory<br>
domains, or by users/administrators. For example, the European FCC has a<br><br>
mandate to move a channel if a radar signal detected. Alternatively, an<br>
administrator may desire to add channel with least noise if the traffic load is above<br>
60%. A user may desire to prioritize cordless phone traffic over WLAN traffic. .<br>
These policies will change over time, and vary by use case. This makes it<br>
impossible to hard code all cases and ship with a product. New or updated policies<br>
created (for example, as explained hereinafter) may be downloaded by the L2<br>
policy manager 340 to the L1 policy engine 240. Management policies may be<br>
expressed in the form of a well-defined grammar. These grammar rules define<br>
concepts, such as RSSI level, CCA percentage, traffic types (voice, data, video,<br>
etc.), protocol type, active channel, alternate channel, etc. Grammar defines<br>
operators, such as "greater than," "max" and "member of."<br>
Grammar allows construction of a prioritized set of if/then rules, in the form<br>
of:<br>
If [condition] then [activation rule]<br>
The activation rules make use of the underlying spectrum management tools, such<br>
as DFS, TPC, etc.<br>
Examples of spectrum policy statements are:<br>
SOHO AP:<br>
if startup<br>
active-channel = random from lowest RSSI(AP)<br>
if active-channel packet errors &gt; 20<br>
active-channel = random from lowest RSSI(AP, STA)<br>
SOHO NIC:<br>
if startup<br>
active-channel = find BSSID) (1234) start with last-active-channel<br>
LARGE WLAN AP:<br>
if startup<br>
Active-channel = fixed 7<br>
if active-channel traffic utilization &gt; 60%<br>
add-channel 8 if measure(channel 8) = low noise<br>
LARGE WLAN NIC:<br><br>
if startup<br>
active-channel = find highest SNR with low CCA<br>
if active-channel collisions &gt; 50%<br>
find alternate channel with low CCA<br>
The policy manager 340 matches the spectrum policy rules against current<br>
conditions, and takes action, acting essentially like a rule-based expert system<br>
"inference engine." The matching intelligence of the policy manager 340 may use<br>
toolkits from the field of artificial intelligence: lisp, prolog, etc. In addition, the<br>
policy manager 340 may use fuzzy logic to deal with fuzzy terms such as "high<br>
traffic", "bad signal strength," etc.<br>
A policy wizard is an example of a policy application 440. It supplies<br>
information to the policy manager 340 and simplifies the task of creating spectrum<br>
policies by asking the user (or administrator) a set of questions, such as:<br>
Is this a home network or an office network?<br>
Is there more than one AP in the network?<br>
Is there one or more cordless phones in the area?<br>
Based on this information, the policy wizard generates spectrum policies<br>
appropriate for those parameters. The spectrum policies are downloaded to the<br>
policy manager 340.<br>
