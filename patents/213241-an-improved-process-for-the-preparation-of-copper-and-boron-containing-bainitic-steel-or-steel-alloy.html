				<td>TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention   relates to   an  improved process for preparation of copper and   boron containing  bainitic steel and products  thereof".<br>
    OF_THE __ INVENTION<br>
The present   invention relates  to an improved process  for  preparation of copper and boron containing bainitic steel  and product   thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART QF THE INVENTION -<br>
The steel or steel of  required far manufacture of pressure, vessels and critical components in a wide variety of engineering structures is required to have combination of high strength and toughness alonciuii the good uieldability and corrosion resistance and resistance to<br>
/<br>
hydrogen cracking are the foremost requirements of any steel or steel alloy to be used for construction of any such engineering structure, which in turn is required to be subjected to pressure (i.e. pressure vessels etc.) and/or exposed to the ; corrosive environment  ships etc.). The exposure to corrosive environment: in turn initiate the corrosion, preferably, oxidation process on the exposed surfaces of the engineering structures of any type made up of steel or steel alloy. This process once initiated results in the deterioration of such engineering structures.<br>
One method of protecting the engineering B t resource as stated herein above;, from corrosive environment,  that<br>
from corrosion, that is to say to enhance the  corrosion resistance, is to apply a coating or  the surface of such structures unhitch in turn is capable1 of protecting the exposed surface of structures or 3un<?r structures or pressure vessels, as the case may he, from corrosive attack or say from initiation of corrosion process. Such coatings are known in the prior art and are being used exhaustively<br/>
The limitation of application of such coat inn that the protection is limited only upto the reds island  to corrosion and that's too for the limited period, high in turn necessitates the repetition of process of coating after regular intervals.<br>
Still another limitation of such coatings is that the, upto ldabi 1 it characteristics and other mechanical properties are neither effect-ed nor improved.<br>
N -,<br>
These limitations are overcame by the improvement of the steel or steel all by itself. Such information are effected by variation in the chemical compositions<br>
»<br>
and  in the process of preparation and in the process  of heat treatment of each steels or steel alloys.<br>
The process of control of such properties, a--, stated herein above, in the steels or steel alloys again has the limitations of its own. Such as, the attempt to increase the strength of ah alloy normally reduce?.; its toughness and vice-versa, even for any known ultra low carbon biotitic steel.' In addition, to meet the requirements of mechanical properties, may call for requirement of either high percentage of one element or low percentage of another element and meeting these requirements will call for complex processing techniques. For example, attaining 1OO is (700MPa&gt; of strength would require high amounts of nickel contents or elaborate processsing and heat treatment.<br>
In, order to overcome the drawbacks of known steels and steel alloys, as stated herein above, variety of steels have been used for construction of en9inee ring structures, as stated here in above, after quenching and tempering. Such steels or steel alloys after the quenching and tempering by 'known methods results in high toughness and high strength.<br>
The disadvantages of such quenched and tempered steels or steel alloys are that, these alloys suffer from inferior weld ability as their high carbon content and carbon equivalent make them susceptible to the hydrogen induced cracking.<br>
' Another drawback of such known quenched and 1; simper eel steels or steel • alloys for construction of such engineering structures, as sheet and herein above is that,<br>
the technological problem, stated in proceeding paragraph demands stringent welding procedures and controls such 3.3 pre-heating. This adds to the cast of the components which require extensive welding.<br>
Still another drawback of such known steels or steel alloys for construction of such engineering structures as stated herein above, is that their process of preparation requires special processing facilities, like roll quenching and special rolling and heat treating facilities for processing some plates of very larqe size required for specific applications for construction of such engineering structures.<br>
Yet another drawback of such known processes or processing techniques, as Stated in preceeding paragraph, is that, setting up of such facilities of roll quenching, special rolling and heat treating, definitely acids to the cost of the process and hence to the of the<br>
products, which may int.urn make it highly uneconom j the demand happens to be low.<br>
Still further disadvantage/drawback of known hi.oh performance quenched and tempered steels or steel alloy-: is their high martensitic hardenabi1ity which rpsults in brittle heat affected zones and associated weld <br>
The ultra low carbon bainitic: steels or s I; known in prior art generally contain relatively his  uhar amounts of costly alloying elements, such as molybdenum and nickel and donot contain capper and boron, The elements molybdenum and nickel are expensive and particularly nickel.<br>
