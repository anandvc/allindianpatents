				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an emulsion composition useful for blasting hard strata excavation work. This invention particularly relates to a novel emulsion composition useful for blasting of hard strata, such as excavation works for surface coal and non-coal mines. The present invention more particularly relates to a novel emulsion composition which is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having physical and explosive properties of the bulk emulsion explosive which are distinct and different from the aggregation of properties of the individual ingredients and is a booster sensitive bulk emulsion explosive composition chargeable to blast hole.<br>
Emulsion explosives, commonly water-in-oil emulsions, provide high interfacial contact between oxidizer and fuel, resulting in a high degree of sensitivity and high rate of reactivity without the use of any molecular explosive.<br>
The unique property of emulsion explosive is its high velocity of detonation (VOD) ranging from 4000-6000 m/s. This results in high detonation pressure and brisance effect which helps in improving rock fragmentation. The fuel phase being water immiscible, these explosives are water resistant and insensitive to impact and fire.<br>
For heavy blasting, site mixed emulsion used as bulk explosives is used in surface blasting. Bulk emulsion having high velocity of detonation, poor sensitive to impact, high explosion energy, good shuttering effect and cheap in the cost is suitable as bulk emulsion explosives. The main drawback of non-cap sensitive bulk emulsion explosives are loosing of explosive material, crystallization of oxidizing agents, breaking of the emulsion lattice, separation of oxidizing and fuel phase, increasing of the density, poor water resistance, misfires, having very poor shelf life poor shuttering effect.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 5,500,062, titled: emulsion explosive, wherein a mixed surfactant system have been used in emulsion explosives for improving emulsion stability to comprise a surfactant and a co-surfactant, each <br>
having branched chain hydrocarbyl tail groups, the former having significantly longer tail chain groups than the latter, for which system poly[alk(en)yl] succinic anhydride based surfactants are especially preferred, said surfactants having an interaction parameter.<br>
Emulsion explosives have been described by, for example, Bluhm in U.S. patent No.: 3,447,978 which discloses a composition comprising an aqueous discontinuous phase containing dissolved oxygen-supplying salts, a carbonaceous fuel continuous phase, an occluded gas and a water-in-oil emulsifier.<br>

These emulsifiers are useful in water-in-oil explosive emulsions.<br>

A method of forming the composition is also provided, characterised by the emulsifier being produced by reacting an alkanolamine with a hydrocarbyl halide.<br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention the composition providing improved oil absorption and increased energy output consists of a mixture of 10 :o 20 wt.% ammonium nitrate prill and 20 to 40 wt.% flake grade aluminium powder.<br>
It is a feature of the present invention that the composition is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having physical and explosive properties of the bulk emulsion explosive which are distinct and different from the aggregation of properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
The present invention provides a novel composition for hard strata excavation work, which contains oxidizing and reducing ingredients, emulsifier, gassing<br><br>
agent(s) to produce zero oxygen balance and composition suitable as bulk emulsion explosive useful as chargeable to blast holes for safe and efficient blasting in surface mine and other excavation works. It is a booster sensitive bulk emulsion chargeable to the blasting hole directly and can play an important role in achieving the objective of blasting in surface mining including coal, metal, dams and other excavation projects.<br>
The novel composition of the present invention has been obtained by the non-obvious inventive steps of providing a combination such as herein above described of oxidizing and reducing ingredients, emulsifier, gassing agent(s) to produce zero oxygen balance, wherein sugar is present in the mixture of oxidizing agents and the gassing agent is a mixture of sodium nitrite and potassium pyro antimonate.<br>
The process of making bulk emulsion explosives is divided into two phases, as depicted in the flow chart given in figure 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
In the first phase, base emulsion matrix having higher density ranging from 1.30 to 1.45 g/cm3 is prepared. The oxidizing agents such as ammonium nitrate (lump), gum and sugar are dissolved in water at a temperature in the range of 60 to70°C in a container (A) to obtain a super saturated solution. The emulsifier, sorbitan mono oleate, reducing agents such as furnace oil and diesel are mixed well in another container (B) and heated at a temperature in the range of 60 to70°C for maximum flow. The super saturated solution of container (A) is slowly mixed with that in container (B) in an emulsifying reactor under stirring at a stirrer speed of above 3000 to 3500 rpm. As the emulsion formation starts, the speed of the stirrer is maintained in between 4000 to 5000 rpm. In this process emulsion matrix having density 1.30 to 1.45 g/cm3 and viscosity 45000 to 65000 cp is<br><br>
prepared. The composition of the base emulsion matrix has a negative oxygen balance (-4.0 to 4.5 g/g approx.).<br>
In the second phase, for bulk emulsion explosive chargeable to blast hole, density of base emulsion should be adjusted in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 g/cm3. For reducing the density, providing improved oil absorption and increased energy output a mixture of 10 to 20 wt.% ammonium nitrate prill and 20 to 40 wt.% flake grade aluminium powder is mixed with the help of stirrer at a very slow speed (100 rpm). Ammonium nitrate prill makes the emulsion matrix nearly zero oxygen balance or slightly negative oxygen balance. To the emulsion matrix is added gassing agent, such as a mixture of potassium pyro antimonite and solution of 20% sodium nitrite and temperature is maintained in the range of 45 to 55°C. The speed of mixing is maintained at 1000 to 1500 rpm. The composition prepared is sensitized enough to be initiated with the help of booster.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention in actual practice and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
