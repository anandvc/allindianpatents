which can be substituted by halogen, cyano, nitro, CF3, C1-C4-alkyl and/or Cx-C4-alkoxy;<br>

for controlling phytopathogenic fungal pests.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to novel phenethylacrylamides, to processes for their preparation, and to compositions comprising them.<br><br>
Various arylacrylamides are disclosed in EP-A 407 217, EP-A 529 736, WO-A 93/01523, JP-A 06/080 616, US 3657340, US 3526653 and JP-A 63/154 649. Some of them are described as herbicides. However, their fungicidal action is unknown in the prior art.<br>
a-Oximinophenylacetic acid arylamides are described in WO-A 96/17825 and WO-A 96/23763 as fungicides and in JP 02/200 658 as herbicides. In WO-A 96/17825, arylacrylamides are only covered by the general disclosure.<br>
However, the fungicidal action of the [lacuna] described in the abovementioned documents is not satisfactory in many cases. It is therefore an object of the invention to find compounds with an improved action.<br>
It has been found that this object is achieved by the use of the phenylethylacrylamides of the Formula I as fungicides and the novel phenethylacrylamides, and compositions comprising them.<br>
The phenethylacrylamides of the formula I can be prepared by the synthetic routes described in EP-A 407 217, EP-A 529 736, WO-A 93/01523, JP-A 06/080 616, US 3657340, US 3526653 and JP-A 63/154 649 whose disclosure is herewith incorporated.<br>
The novel phenethylacrylamides in which R1 and R2 are identical and are CI, F and CH3 can be obtained, for example, starting from a-keto esters of the formula II where R is C1-C4-alkyl by the routes described hereinbelow:<br>
Compounds in which R1 and R2 are chlorine are obtained by reacting a-keto esters of the formula II with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and CCI4 to give acrylic esters of the formula Ilia. This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures from 10°C to 120°C, preferably 20°C to 80°C, in an inert organic solvent [cf. tetrahedron Lett., p. 3003 et seq., 1988].<br><br>
Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, and chlorobenzene, nitriles such as iacetonitrile and propionitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide and dimethyl acetamide, especially preferably<br><br>
acetonitrile and propionitrile. Mixtures of these may also be used.<br>
In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ CCI4 and PPh3 in excess based on II.<br>
Compounds in which R1 and R2 are fluorine are obtained by reacting a-keto esters of the formula II with<br>
diphenyl-1/l-difluoromethylphosphine of the formula VI where Ph is phenyl, to give acrylic esters of the formula Illb. This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures from -70°C to +80°C, preferably 0°C to 20°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base [cf. tetrahedron Lett., p. 5571 et seq., 1990].<br><br>

In general, the bases are employed in catalytic amounts, and they may also be used in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvents.<br>
In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ VI in an excess based on II.<br>
Alternatively, compounds in which R1 and R2 are fluorine, may also be obtained by reacting a-keto esters of the formula II with sodium 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroacetate, of the formula VII, and triphenylphosphine (PPI13) to give acrylic esters of the formula<br><br>
Illb. This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures from 20°C to 180°C, preferably 60°C to 180°Cr in an inert organic solvent [cf. Org. Synth. Vol. V, p. 949 et seq. (1973)].<br><br>
Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and 1,2-diethoxyethane, nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, especially preferably THF and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Mixtures of these may also be used.<br>
In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ VII in an excess based on II.<br>
Compounds in which R1 and R2 are methyl are obtained by reacting ct-keto esters of the formula II with iso-propylphosphonium halide of the formula VIII in the sense of a Wittig reaction. Preferred as halides of the formula VIII are iodides and bromides.<br><br>
In the above reaction scheme, (P) in the formula VIII is a<br>
phosphoranyl radical, such as, for example, triphenylphosphoranyl.<br>
The Wittig reaction is usually carried out at temperatures from -78°C to +85°C, preferably -10°C to +65°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base [cf. Can. J. Chem. 1971, p. 2143 et seq.].<br>
Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran (THF), nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide,<br><br>
especially preferably diethyl ether and THF. Mixtures of these may also be used.<br>
Suitable bases are, generally, inorganic compounds such as alkali metal hydrides and alkaline earth metal hydrides such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and calcium hydride, alkali metal amides such as lithium amide, sodium amide and potassium amide, organometal compounds, in particular alkali metal alkyls such as methyllithium, butyllithium, and phenyllithium, alkali metal alkoxides and alkaline earth metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and dimethoxymagnesium. Sodium hydride and sodium methoxide are especially preferred.<br>
In general, the bases are employed in catalytic amounts, but they may also be used in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvent.<br>
In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ VIII in an excess based on II.<br>
Carboxylic esters of the formula III in which R1 and R2 are identical and are CI, F and CH3 are hydrolyzed by customary methods to give the carboxylic acids of the formula IV [cf. Organikum [Organic Chemistry], 16th Edition, p. 415 and 622, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1985] • This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures from 10°C to 80°C, preferably 20°C to 60°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base such as alkali metal hydroxides or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, in particular sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
Carboxylic acids of the formula IV can be amidated in the known manner directly with phenethylamines of the formula V to give the compounds of the formula I [cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, [Methods in Organic Chemistry], Vol. E5, pp. 941-972, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart and New York 1985].<br><br><br>
In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ V in an excess based on IV.<br>
Alternatively, carboxylic acids of the formula IV may first be activated prior to amidation with V, for example by converting them into acyl halides, in particular acyl chlorides of the formula IVa.<br><br>
The chlorination of carboxylic acids IV is usually carried out at temperatures from -20°C to 100°C, preferably -10°C to 80°C, in an inert organic solvent [cf. Organikum, 16th Edition, p. 423 et seq., VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1985].<br>
Chlorinating agents which are suitable for this reaction are the customary inorganic or organic chlorinating agents, for example bhionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride, briphenylphosphine/CCl4, preferably thionyl chloride.<br>
Solvents which are suitable are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ether, aromatic lydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated lydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and :hlorobenzene, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, :ert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran, litriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, ketones such as icetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and tert-butyl nethyl ketone, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and iimethylacetamide, especially preferably acetonitrile, toluene ind tetrahydrofuran. Mixtures of these may also be used.<br><br>
In general, the chlorinating agents are employed in at least equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ them in an excess of up to 10 mol per mol of IV, preferably up to 5 mol, in particular up to 3 mol.<br>
The amidation of the acyl halides with the phenethylamine of the formula V is carried out as illustrated, for example, for the compound iVa:<br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of 0°C to 80°C, preferably 20°C to 40°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base [cf. Organikum, 16th Edition, p. 412 et seq., VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1985].<br>
Suitable solvents are ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and THP, nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, especially preferably diethyl ether and THF. Mixtures of these may also be used.<br>
Bases which can be used are, generally, inorganic compounds such as alkali metal carbonates and alkaline earth metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate, and also alkali metal hydrogen carbonates such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, furthermore organic bases, for example tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri-isopropylethylamine and N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, substituted pyridines such as collidine, lutidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and bicyclic amines. Triethylamine and pyridine are especially preferred.<br>
In general, the bases are employed in catalytic amounts, but they may also be used in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvent.<br>
In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ V in an excess based on IVa.<br><br>
The starting materials of the formula II which are required for the preparation of the compounds I are known from the literature, for example commercially available, or can be prepared via the following routes:<br><br>
The bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) or l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydrantoin is usually carried out at temperatures of 0°C to 200°C, preferably 20°C to 110°C, in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a free-radical initiator [cf. Synthetic Reagents, Vol. 2, pp. 1-63, Wiley, New York (1974); J. Heterocyclic Chem. pp. 1431-1436 (1993); Synth. Commun. p. 2803 et seq. (1996); J. Med. Chem. p. 481 et seq. (1981)].<br>
The bromine compounds lib are oxidized directly to give a-keto esters II. The oxidation with N-methylmorpholine oxide or p-dimethylaminopyridine oxide is usually carried out at temperatures of 0°C to 100°C, preferably 20°C to 60°C, in dimethylsulfoxide [cf. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., p. 2221 (1981)].<br>
As an alternative, phenyl acetic esters Ila can also be oxidized directly to give a-keto esters II. The oxidation can be carried out, for example, with SeC&gt;2 or KMn04; it is usually carried out at temperatures of 20°C to 180°C, preferably 20°C to 120°C, in an inert organic solvent [cf. Synthesis, p. 915 (1994); Synth Commun., p. 1253 (1988); J. Gen. Chem. USSR, Vol. 21, p. 694 et seq. (1951)].<br>
The phenyl acetic esters Ila which are required for the preparation of the compounds II are known from the literature or commercially available.<br>
Those specific compounds I which are not accessible by the above-described routes can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.<br>
If the synthesis yields isomer mixtures, their separation is, however, generally not absolutely necessary since some of the individual isomers can be converted into each other during processing for use or upon use (for example when exposed to light, acids or bases). Corresponding conversions may also take place after application, for example in the case of plant<br><br>
treatment in the treated plants or in the fungal or animal pests to be controlled.<br>
The reaction mixtures are processed in the customary manner, for example by mixing with water, phase separation and, if appropriate, chromatographic purification of the crude products. In some cases, the intermediate and end products are obtained in the form of colorless or pale brown, viscous oils which are freed or purified of volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperature. If the intermediates and end products are obtained as solids, they can also be purified by recrystallization or digestion.<br>

Examples of the action against fungal pests<br>
The fungicidal action of the compounds of the formula I was demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active ingredients were formulated separately or jointly as a 10% strength emulsion in a mixture of 70% by weight of cyclohexanone, 20% by weight of Nekanil® LN (Lutensol® AP6, wetter with emulsifying and dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkyl phenols) and 10% by weight of Wettol® EM (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil) and diluted with water to give the desired concentration.<br>
Use Example 1 - Efficacy against Phytophthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
Leaves of potted plants cv. "GroBe Fleischtomate St. Pierre" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension made with a stock solution of 10% active ingredient, 63% cyclohexanone and 27% emulsifier. The next day, the leaves were infected with a cold aqueous zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans at a density [sic] of 0.25 x 106 spores/ml. Then, the plants were replaced into a chamber with 100% atmospheric humidity at temperatures between 18 and 20°C. After 6 days, the blight had developed to such an extent on the untreated, but infected, control plants that it was possible to visually determine the disease level in percent.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 ppm of the active ingredients 1-1, 1-2, 1-11, 1-17, 1-19, 1-25, 1-26, 1-27, 1-32, 1-33, 1-34, 1-39, 1-40, 1-42, 1-43, 1-45, 1-46 and 1-49 of table I showed a disease level of not more than 10%, while the disease level of the untreated plants was 90%.<br>
Use  Example 2 - Efficacy against Plasmopara viticola<br>
Leaves of potted grapevines of the variety "Muller-Thurgau" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous active ingredient preparation made with a stock solution of 10% active ingredient, 53% cyclohexanone and 27% emulsifier. The next day, the leaves tfere inoculated with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Plasmopara iriticola. Then, the grapevines were first placed for 48 hours into a chamber at 24°C and 100% atmospheric humidity and then for 5 days in a greenhouse at temperatures between 20 and 30°C. After this time, the plants were returned for 16 hours into a humid chamber to accelerate the eruption of sporangiophores. The extent<br><br>
to which the disease had developed on the undersides of the leaves was then determined visually.<br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 250 ppm of the active ingredients 1-1, 1-2, 1-10, 1-11, 1-12, 1-16, 1-17, 1-19, 1-21 to 1-27, 1-29, 1-30, 1-32, 1-33, 1-34, 1-39, 1-40, 1-42, 1-43, 1-45, 1-46, 1-48 and 1-49 of table I showed a disease level of not more than 10%, while the disease level of the untreated plants was 90%.<br>
Comparative experiment - long-term action against Phytophthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
Tomato plants cv. "Grofle Fleischtomate St, Pierre" in the 4-leaf stage were sprayed to run off point with an aqueous suspension made with a stock solution of 10% active ingredient, 63% cyclohexanone and 27% emulsifier. To test the long-term action of the compounds, the leaves were infected with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans one week after application. &gt; The plants were subsequently placed in a chamber with 100% atmospheric humidity at temperatures between 16 and 18°C. After 6 days, the blight had developed to such an extent on the untreated, but infected, control plants that it was possible to visually determine the disease level in %.<br>
The compound of the structure below, which is known from WO-A 96/23763, acted as comparative active ingredient:<br><br>
In this test, the plants which had been treated with 63 ppm of the active ingredients 1-1, 1-2, 1-11, 1-33 and 1-34 of table I showed a disease level of zero to 25%, while the plants which had been treated with 63 ppm of the comparative active ingredient showed a disease level of 40% and the untreated plants showed a disease level of 100%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
