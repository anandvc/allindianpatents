Description<br>
The invention relates to a drive system for a partition wall system consisting of individual components, whereas some of them are equipped with drive media allowing their automatic moving, whereby the individual components are horizontally movable, by means of rollers or other devices at or in a guide rail mounted on the ceiling, in a way that the individual components are automatically displaced from a line-up arrangement into a jammed parking position. Here at least part of the individual components is provided with separate drive media, which guide the corresponding components independently and/or simultaneously from the other components along the guide rail. The control is realised by a central control unit combined with a microprocessor which output signal is activating the data and the addresses via at least a two-wire connection (databus) to all drive media. Technically seen it is also possible to employ an extra control line in addition to the two-wire connection. The individual control and regulation of the individual components is possible, and both the driving speed as well as the additional functions. Furthermore in addition to the utilisation of a direct-current drive a control unit may be put to use which realises the control and the regulation of the individual components via existing low-voltage lines. All program data may be read-out or changed on a control terminal:<br>
A device and procedure for the operation of an automatic partition wall system is described in<br>
the DE 44 24 660 Cl, in which the individual<br>
components are horizontally moved by means of a common drive. Moreover, the installation is conceived in that an existing movable partition wall system is equipped subsequently with a motorised drive allowing moving individual components by motor power. For this type, the already existing manually operated system is<br><br>
3<br>
not exchanged, that means the individual component s may also be moved manually. For automatization purpose, an additional rail system is mounted on the ceiling in front of the existing guide rail in which the individual components of the partition wall system are displaced. Switchable coupling equipment provided with an identification system runs in this rail system, to detect single components containing corresponding indicators and to transfer them into the generally pivoted parking position. An electrical motor propelling an endless belt via a deflection roller drives the whole device. The identification system is controlled in connection with a programmable control unit in a way that, after a trial learning run, it recognises the individual components and transports them into the desired parking position or into the partition wall's close position.<br>
The Swiss patent application 1160/96 until today not published with the title "Moving Wall11 describes a moving wall with a motor drive where the individual moving wall components present media that run the corresponding moving wall component along a guide rail independently from the other moving wall components. Moreover each moving wall component is attributed an own drive unit with electrical motor as drive media. The electrical motor's driving shaft is again equipped with media through which the working junction, together with a working surface or working profile arranged along the guide rail or almost parallel to the latter, drives the moving wall component along- the guide rail. In order to realise conveying the individual moving wall components along the guide rail, a current collector appliance is installed in working junction with the line current bar appliance, and is moved along the line current bar appliance arranged stationary side by side to the guide rail. Here, while conveying the moving wall component, the line current bar appliance is rendered electrically conducting to trigger the drive motor's activation.  As to<br><br>
4<br><br>
control the partition wall system in individual partial sections, at least one out of the two line current bars is divided into multiple sections insulated against each other, that is to say tappings, that may be powered individually and purposeful via a power pack. Such installation is very expensive, as especially with greater installations a large number of line current bars has to be mounted.<br>
The DE 31 50 581 Al reveals a control procedure for remote control operation on low-voltage lines. Here, signals coming from a central station are transferred to numerous substations exactly via low-voltage lines on which a high frequency signal is modulated. As for postal reasons, the signal emission is only allowed when a pre-determined transmitting power is not exceeded, this procedure employs a modification of signal lengths and frequencies to reach a maximum transmitting level and by doing this limits the data volume.<br>
DE  33  46 416 Al  for  example  shows  an<br>
installation for communication engineering to transmit information according to the aforementioned method. With this equipment a HF-signal is superimposed between a sender and a receiver at low-frequent mains voltage. For this purpose, sender and receiver stations are respectively connected to different outer conductors. With the intention to achieve a secure information transfer from one outer conductor to another outer conductor, electronic couplers designed as LC resonance links are described. Principally these electronic couplers transmit the useful signals in a lossless manner. In addition, they represent a suppressor to the low-frequent mains voltage, such that corresponding safety requirements are respected.<br>
Another procedure and arrangement to control communication terminals is disclosed by DE 42 43 504 Al. Here, one or more input devices and a display device are arranged in a room. Data are transferred to another local control unit via the input device on pushing buttons. When selecting functional buttons accordingly on the<br><br>
-5-<br>
input device a pre-selection is made as to which of the linked communication terminals should be finally activated.<br>
Moreover , so-called remote controls for the existent electric network are known in installation engineering representing for example 256 device addresses that are activated directly via a keyboard. A general easy to survey LCD screen displays simultaneously these corresponding functions. Further to the manual input, these operations may be automated by using appropriate programmable memories It is conceivable that such control automatically activates and deactivates for example, blinds, lights, etc Likewise, there is a controller supervising the usual operations. Also, in case of absence of persons, memorized information may be requested and activated via telephone by means of a suitable electronic device.<br>
The object of the invention is to simplify the state of the art in conceiving a simple activation modus for automatic operated partition walls and moreover that such device may be manufactured economically in multiple partial components.<br>
To solve the above problem, the present invention provides a drive system for a partition wall comprised of a plurality of partition wall components supported at or hanging from guide rails mounted to the ceiling of a building, said partition wall components being horizontally movable by means of rollers or the like such that the individual partition wall components are automatically guided from a line-up position to a parking position, wherein :<br>
at least part of each partition wall component is provided with separate drive means in the form of a drive unit that moves the partition wall component independently of or simultaneously with the other partition wall components along said guide rails ,<br><br>
-6-<br>
a central control unit with a microprocessor, memories, encoders and decoders is provided ;<br>
the output of said control unit is connected via at least a two-wire connection in the form of a databus for outputting signals for transmitting data and addresses to the leaf drive units simultaneously for activating the drive units of the partition wall components, said control unit being adapted to control and regulate each individual partition wall component and to carry out additional miscellaneous functions for each partition wall component or in each partition wall component; and<br>
a control terminal is provided for reading in or reading out and changing of data and addresses to and from the control unit.<br>
The output signal of the central control unit may be a direct current voltage signal, the leaf drive units being each provided with a direct current motor. Alternatively, the output signal of the central control unit can be an alternating current voltage signal (low voltage), the leaf drive units each being provided with an alternating current motor.<br>
The central control unit preferably digitally prepares data and addresses and serially feeds them by means of a databus.<br>
One digital address may be attributed to each partition wall component. The leaf drive units are preferably provided with at least one decoder and at least one memory and return the received data and addresses to the central control unit.<br>
The partition wall components can be adapted to be conveyed at different speeds in partial areas. The miscellaneous function referred to earlier may consist in automatically   activating   a   locking.   The   miscellaneous   function   preferably<br><br>
-7-<br>
comprises the control of turnout drives included within the guide rails, the turnout drives comprising a turnout memory and a decoder respectively with corresponding switching and/or blocking elements.<br>
The supply voltage of the leaf drive units may be realised by low frequency voltage with a superimposed HF-signal.<br>
The line current bars are preferably integrated into the guide rails. In a preferred embodiment, the guide rail is simultaneously employed as line current bar.<br>
The guide rail may be simultaneously employed as line current bar The power supply and the data for the databus can be transferred by induction. The data may also be radioed or transmitted by infrared to the databus<br>
The partition wall system consists of several individual partition wall components, provided each with drive media to drive the individual components. In that case, the components may be conveyed such that they can be horizontally moved via rollers inside or at a guide rail system hanging from the ceiling. Conveying is especially necessary when for example the individual components are to be automatically conveyed for example out of their line-up arrangement, that is to say closed frontage, into a generally laterally located parking position (station). In this case, it may be a partial opening or also a complete opening of the whole frontage. In a counter-move the parked components have to be transferred from the parking position back into the closed frontage. The individual components<br><br>
8 <br>
may   be    conveyed    independently    and/or simultaneously inside the guide rails.   Each separate  component  that  is  to  be  conveyed individually  presents  a  corresponding  drive unit with electric motor, preferably a direct current motor.  Components that are not to be conveyed do not present a drive unit.   The individual  electric  motor.  is  respectively activated by means of a central control unit, which is equipped with a microprocessor and energises   all   the   individual   components contained in a wall.  Here, the central control unit's   output   signal   is   simultaneously transferred  to  all  individual  drive media through a  two-wire  system  (databus).      In addition to data on speed and position,  the output signal contains especially data defining an identification and inherent the address of the individual component.  This is the way to make  possible  an  individual  control  and regulation  for  the  individual  components, whereby simultaneously additional miscellaneous functions  may  be  realised,   for   example constitutional of the components or also for example  as  to  control  turnouts  in order  to guide the components into different stations. Changing the data and addresses is performed by means of the control terminal wireless as well as also by cable connection.<br>
The present state of the art allows conveying only one component respectively via one selection line, whereas the invention realises the desire to control several components independently from one another via a databus. The almost realistic operation of a partition wall system requires, and that is a principal prerequisite, controlling the individual components independently from one another in order to realise a quick opening respectively a partial opening with the lowest possible effort.<br>
In the case of the Swiss patent application 1160/96 each individual component that is to be independently controlled is provided with its own electric circuit. In a station area it is also possible to switchably design individual<br><br>
9 <br>
track   sections   at   relatively   important expenses.<br>
Thanks to the central control unit according to the invention presenting besides the microprocessor also suitable memories to Store tire individual programs and addresses, it is possible to regulate and to control a large number of partial components completely independently from one another via a two-wire connection. The installation has no longer to be divided into individual electric circuits. To identify the individual components, they will receive a so-called address, consisting for example of a number. This address is entered by means of the employed manual terminal, and the central control unit will then recognise the individual components and controls and regulates them according to the selected program. This is feasible independently wherever the individual partial component may be positioned within the guide rail. Of course, it is also conceivable that in such installation traditionally operated track sections continue to exist to realise special functions that should not be influenced by the control terminal.<br>
For programming an individual component, the component's corresponding address is selected on the control terminal. Simultaneously the central control unit will check whether the address entered is valid, and, if not, a suitable message is displayed on the terminal. Then the corresponding speed at which the individual component should be conveyed may be programmed, this can be a uniform speed, a reduced speed adapted to curves (guide rail) and to position the individual components may also be programmed, or respectively also an accelerated speed. The microprocessor within the central control unit transforms the information on the one side into the appropriate component's address and the speed. In this case the data are transmitted serially via the databus, simultaneously a reply coming from the individual component is transferred to the central control unit, in order to know on the one  side where the component is exactly<br><br>
10<br>
positioned within the complete guide rail system, and on the other side to know at which speed it is conveyed and whether all preset parameters are executed by the software, especially additional functions and thus orders.<br>
For the databus execution, it is advantageous to realise a two-wire system for example as line current bars, which allow reception of the corresponding data and addresses by means of the individual component's slipers. For this purpose, a decoder is provided inside the individual component's drive unit, which decoder decodes accordingly the particular data and addresses emitted by the central control unit and makes these facts accessible and stores them to a memory that is also incorporated in the drive unit.<br>
At the same time, the decoder will verify whether the emitted address is compatible with its memorised address. In case the address is not compatible, this particular partial component will not move at all, and in this case ignores the received data, what means at the same time, that the stored data for example as of speed and miscellaneous functions are preserved. Only when the central control uni t sends the right address, the decoder processes this information and emits according data to the drive unit. The drive unit will then execute the corresponding speed respectively the particular specific functions.<br>
Besides conveying individual partial components, it is also thinkable for example to switch turnouts via the same databus, that is to say the same electric-supply lines. In such case, the turnouts are also electrically combined with the databus and likewise provided with a corresponding address, which implies simultaneously the presence of a memory and a decoder inside the turnout. The central control unit is able to transmit according data to the selected turnout such that this turnout takes the intended position.<br>
The central  control unit  delivers  a  digital voltage, which two extreme values {peak values)<br><br>
11<br><br>
are in the positive range and negative range. The definition is made such that the central control unit, in case it does not deliver any data to the databus, transmits a rest level situated in the negative voltage range. When data are sent, the voltage changes from the negative to the positive range. Thus it is possible to use the according data for additional functions from the digital voltage's negative range, as this predominates with regard to the positive range. Thereby, it is workable that particular switching operations are not imperatively linked to conveying the component. Consequently, it is declared that in this digital system the voltage is independent from the individual component's conveying voltage. There is, so to say, at all time a positive mean value in voltage that is used to supply the drive motor, wheraas the miscellaneous functions are supplied from the negative range in the digital voltage, that is to say via a half-way rectification.<br>
The aforementioned explications clearly show that with components equipped with the suitable electric motor within the drive unit, a custom designed displacement and thus conveying of the individual components may be realised in a simple and inexpensive way without having to change the central control unit. Required is a databus with two interconnection lines, additional expensive wiring is not necessary. Furthermore, there is the option for example to realise additional functions, e.g. open or close blinds inside a component; activate or deactivate a component's locking against unintended opening; e.g. rendering a glass pane obscure via suitable voltage application (Privalight); execution of additional control functions to switch turnouts in that individual partial components are guided to different stations so that stations do not demand to much space and likewise to admit conveying at different speed within certain track sections.<br>
Furthermore to the aforementioned activation kind of the individual partition wall components, it is conceivable realising and thus executing all functions described above by<br><br>
-12-<br>
means of a network bus, that is to say an adequate HF-signal is superimposed on a low-frequency voltage line (scale-of-two circuit). The HF-signal contains all relevant data for the individual component's drive units, which will then, according to the information stored in their memories after decoding, execute the intended movements of the component (s). In this case too, a terminal may be employed for programming and running automatically the relevant control and regulation functions. Especially with regard to store opening hours, this is particularly significant, so that timed operations are automatically performed using the corresponding program memories, e.g. opening and closing the partition wall or realising only partial opening or partial closing<br>
Power supply to the whole partition wall system is either executed by means of separate line current bars running alongside the guide rails, respectively it is also feasible to integrate the line current bars into the guide rails. In another application type it would be possible that when separating the guide rail correspondingly, the guide rail could simultaneously act as line current bar.<br>
All data relevant to control such partition wall system without any problem may be transmitted by induction, for example to the system. In that case, the power supply could also be transmitted. Furthermore, it is thinkable that only the data are radioed or transmitted by infrared to the databus.<br>
The invention is explained in detail on the basis of one possible execution example represented in the accompanying drawings, wherein -Figure 1 shows:       a functional block diagram of a control for several<br>
components of a partition wall system Figure 2 shows:       same as figure 1, with the difference that data are radioed.<br><br>
13<br>
Figure 3 shows:  trimmed area of a partition<br>
wall system with parking station.<br>
Figure 1 represents a control unit 1 that is connected via an electrical interconnection 30 to a control terminal 29. In a modification of the execution type, the electrical interconnection 3 0 may be eliminated and the control terminal 29 may radio its data to  the control unit 1 in order to control and change the complete system. The control unit 1 is linked to a system of line current bars 4, whereby figure 1 for simplicity reasons only represents one line current bar 4. Current collectors 5, 6, directly linked to separated leaf drive units 14, 23 via electrical interconnections 12, 13, collaborate with the line current bar 4. The supply voltage delivered by the central control unit 1 is thus delivered via the line current bar 4, the current collector 5 and the electrical interconnection 12 for example to the leaf drive unit 14. The leaf drive unit 14 comprises a drive 15 in form of an electric motor. In case of a partition wall system, all single components do not need a separate drive 15. It is moreover t'hinkable that individual components are mechanically combined to each other. The drive 15 is supplied with the required supply voltage coming from the leaf drive unit 14 via an electrical interconnection 17. To the inside of the component comprising for example the leaf drive unit 14 via an electrical interconnection 19 is  linked  a component decoder 16 made to decode the data contained in the line current bar 4, the current collector 5  and the electrical interconnection 12. The component decoder 16 sends a reply to the leaf drive unit 14 via an electrical interconnection 18. Via the line current bar 4, these data of the decoder 16 are then sent back to the central control unit 1 in opposite direction with regard to the received data. In the execution example, the leaf drive unit 14 is connected to a locking 22. The locking 22 is controlled by means of corresponding   data   that   were   likewise<br><br>
14<br>
transmitted to the locking 22 from the central control unit 1 via the line current bar 4, the current collector 5 and the electrical interconnection 12. In an analogous manner a reply is realised via an electrical interconnection 21 to the central control unit 1.<br>
In case the partition wall component connected to a leaf drive unit 14, for example in form of a movable leaf, is conveyed and has got a corresponding drive order, this is to say, as already explained in the general description, that the partition wall component drives to a certain position as a result of the transmitted address. This may be realised for example likewise via a turnout. The turnout has got  a turnout drive 2, which has received the corresponding control signal from the central control unit 1 via the line current bar 4 and an intermediate electrical interconnection 7. The turnout drive 2 is simultaneously equipped with a turnout decoder 3 comprising a memory and is thus able to read the received data from the databus and to trigger an activation of the turnout drive 2. Similarly the turnout decoder 3 is linked by an electrical interconnection 8 back to the central control unit 1 via the line current bar 4. In the before described way numerous  components of the partition wall system may be regulated and controlled simultaneously and independently as to speed and also as to their positions. In the execution example described above, the leaf drive unit 14 presents a locking 22, which regularly locks the complete closed wall once placed in the closed positionr Another leaf drive element 23 linked likewise to the "line current bar 4 via the electrical interconnection 13 with its current collector 6, comprises a drive 25 that is connected to the leaf drive unit 2 3 via an electrical interconnection 24. The drive 25 also presents a component decoder 26 able to be fed with data via an electrical interconnection 28 and simultaneously data may be read out of the component  de'coder  2 6  and  returned  to  the<br><br><br>
15<br><br>
central control unit 1 via a interconnection 27.<br>
In addition to the turnout drive 2 activation described above, another amount of turnouts is conceivable within the partition wall system, for example another turnout drive 3 6 is linked to the line current bar 4 via an electrical interconnection 9. Again this turnout drive 36 will  present  a  turnout  decoder  10  with  a memory.    The  electrical  interconnection  11 provides the reply from the turnout decoder 10 to the central control unit 1.<br>
The control terminal 33 including a receiver 34 and a sender 35 is represented in the execution example in figure 2. Via an antenna 38 the relevant signals and data are transmitted to a sender and receiver unit 31 and received by their antenna 37. This sender and receiver unit 31 can either be integrated into the central control unit 1 or it is possible' to connect it adaptively to the central control unit 1 and it is thus permanently linked to the central control unit 1 via an electrical interconnection 32.<br>
In addition to the schematic figure 1 and 2 drawings a partition wall system equipped with guide rails 45 and 48 is shown in another drawing of figure 3.   A branch 46 connects these  guide  rails 45,  48  to  each  other. Moreover, the guide rail 48, presents branches 47, 49, 50,. 53. Turnouts  combined with their turnout drives 2, 36, 42 are respectively found  at the branches' 47, 49, 50, 51.   The turnout drives 2, 36, 42 present each a turnout decoder 3, 10/ 39.  the turnout decoders 3, 10, 29 are linked to the  line current bars, 4  running alongside the guide rails 45, 48 via electrical  <br>
 interconnections 54,  55,  56.   Simultaneously   there is an additional line current bar 4 0 to control the last leaf which bar is linked to the line current bar 4 via a corresponding electrical interconnection 41.<br>
The partition wall system components can now be conveyed into their respective parking position, in this special case placed in mural recesses 44, 45, 58.  The components 52, 53 are<br><br>
16<br><br>
controlled by means of the turnout drives 2, 36, 42 such to be conveyed into their parking position  which  is  located  in  this  special execution example inside a wall 43.  The line current bars 4 operate the turnout drives 2, 36, 42 activation, as well as speed control and positioning of the individual components.<br><br><br>
