Related Patent Application<br>
This is a continuation in part of United States Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/764111 filed January 23,2004 entitled Method for Monitoring and Providing<br>
Information Over a Peer to Peer Network.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for improving peer to peer network<br>
communications, and, in particular, to connecting one or more peer to peer networks<br>
together and accepting communication messages from one and providing it to another<br>
and optionally changing communication message radius parameters to increase the<br>
communication message radius of travel on the network.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As used herein, peer to peer networks which are the subject of the present<br>
invention comprise multiple nodes, each node typically consisting both of file server<br>
and client which can send and receive data or "Communication messages" to or from<br>
a node to which such is connected.<br>
In a peer to peer network each node is connected to other nodes over a<br>
communication medium such as the internet either directly or through some type of<br>
proxy. For example, when a search request is issued such originating node sends a<br>
search request to all of the nodes to which it is connected, (see Figure 1) These nodes<br>
search their list of available files and if a match is found they send a response back<br>
with the location. However, a peer to peer proxy network typically consists of node A<br>
which is connected to a node B and node B is connected to a node C. (see Figure 2)<br>
Node A is not directly connected to node C such that if node A issues a search request<br>
it will be forwarded to node B and Node B will search its available files and if a<br>
match is found it will send a response back to node A. Node B will then forward<br>
node A's request to node C and Node C will search its available files and if a match is<br>
found it will send a response back to node B. Node B will then forward this response<br>
to node A. Figure 3 depicts a nonproxy loop network wherein each node is directly<br>
connected to another.<br>
Some peer to peer networks utilize a leaf node/main node proxy topology (See<br>
Figure 4) where some codes are classified as main nodes and the remaining nodes are<br>
classified as leaf nodes. Leaf nodes can only connect to main nodes. Only main<br>
nodes can connect to other main nodes. When a leaf node issues a search request it<br>
sends the request to the main node with which it is connected. The main node then<br>
forwards the request to any other leaf nodes that are connected to it and also to any<br>
main nodes to which it is connected. These main nodes forward the request to any<br>
leaf nodes that are connected to them.<br>
In peer to peer networks, communication messages are sent to the nodes to<br>
which they are connected and, in turn, each of those nodes send the communication<br>
messages to other nodes to which they are connected.<br>
Multiple peer to peer networks exist, usually each having a preferred set of<br>
attributes. Users wishing to utilize one peer to peer network for its specific attributes<br>
must install specific software to access the specific network. Often users wish to<br>
access multiple networks and therefore have multiple software applications installed<br>
on their computer. When the user wishes to search a specific network the user must<br>
start the specific software application and initiate the search. If the result is not<br>
satisfactory, the user must launch a second application and search a second peer to<br>
peer network. Thus, it would be advantageous if users could search one network<br>
using the software application of their choice and have their communication messages<br>
be forwarded to a second network automatically.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, a peer to peer networks is depicted but which is<br>
normally quite large. Often these networks comprise hundreds of thousands of nodes.<br>
To reduce the bandwidth required to operate such networks, nodes have a community<br>
imposed transmission distance or "Radius" limitation. Communication messages<br>
contain communication message radius parameters such as "hops" and time to live.<br>
Hops is a value that normally starts at 0 and increments each time the communications<br>
is forwarded. Time to live is a value that normally starts at S and is decremented each<br>
time the communications is forwarded. When hops reaches a preset limit, often 5, or<br>
time to live reaches 0, the communications is dropped from the network. Often nodes<br>
have a "Max time to live" setting and this value is typically set to 5. If a node<br>
receives a communication message time to live which is higher than its configured<br>
max time to live, the packet is either dropped or the communication message time to<br>
live is dropped to the configured value in the max time to live. This effectively<br>
enforces a community time to live value and limits the number of nodes that would<br>
receive communication message from a transmitting node. It would be advantageous<br>
if the communication message could travel some distance and then have its<br>
communication message radius parameters changed to an optimal or near optimal<br>
value to increase the distance the communication message could travel. For instance,<br>
a communication message could travel 4 hops and then have its settings changed back<br>
to 0.<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
improving peer to peer network communications. It is yet another object of the<br>
present invention to connect two or more peer to peer networks together and accept<br>
communication messages from one and provide it to another. It is yet another object<br>
of the present invention to accept communication messages from a peer to peer<br>
network and change the communication message radius parameters to an optimal or<br>
near optimal value and retransmit the communication message so that the radius or<br>
distance of the communication is extended.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally, the present invention provides a method for improving peer to peer<br>
network communications by utilizing at least one of the methods set forth below. The<br>
preferred method comprises the steps of:<br>
For example, at least one improvement-node is placed into a peer to peer<br>
network. The improvement-node (a) may optionally connect a second time to<br>
the same or a different peer to peer network; (b) may accept communication<br>
messages from one network and forwarding it onto the same or another<br>
network, optionally setting the communication message radius parameters to<br>
an optimal or near optimal value. Additionally, the improvement-node may<br>
accept communication messages from one network and compare it to a set of<br>
definitions to make a decision to drop or forward the communication message.<br>
It may optionally set the communication message radius parameters to an<br>
optimal or near optimal value and forward the communication message.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a method for connecting one or more<br>
peer to peer networks together and accepting communication messages from one and<br>
providing it to another. The invention does not require that all communication<br>
messages be forwarded or that the improvement-node connect to multiple networks.<br>
In one such embodiment the improvement-node only forwards search and search<br>
resoonse communication messages while not forwarding other communication<br>
messages. In another embodiment the improvement-node connects to the same<br>
network and accepts communication messages, changes the communication messages<br>
radius parameters to an optimal or near optimal value, and resends it on the same<br>
network. In another embodiment the improvement-node accepts all communication<br>
messages and forwards all communication messages. In another embodiment the<br>
improvement-node accepts communication messages from one network and uses<br>
preconfigured information to decide if it should forward it onto another network. In<br>
yet another embodiment the improvement-node accepts communication messages<br>
from a node on a network and issues new communication messages containing the<br>
same information onto the same network or different network on behalf of the original<br>
node.<br>
In all of the embodiments, the improvement-node is configured to have one or<br>
more of the features set forth below. These features are employed in the method for<br>
improving peer to peer network communication to provide enhanced capabilities<br>
compared to the network nodes in the particular network being addressed. Thus, not<br>
all of the capabilities need to be programmed into each improvement-node in order to<br>
accept and forward communication messages. The presently preferred configurations<br>

Description of Presently Preferred Embodiments<br>
With reference to Figures 7 and 8, the preferred methods of the present<br>
invention advantageously utilize at least one improvement-node. The improvementnode<br>
has certain preferred attributes and these attributes are configured for the<br>
specific type of communications improvement desired by the end user.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, an improvement-node<br>
comprises both a hardware system such as a computer, thin appliance, ASIC based<br>
device or other similar device, which can be programmed with specific logic or<br>
programming code (i.e. software). In the preferred embodiments, the device<br>
preferably has the capability of being connected with a physical network either<br>
directly or though the use of a gateway. The programming logic provides the device<br>
with the capability to transmit and receive on both physical networks as well as the<br>
peer to peer networks which typically ride on top of a physical network. In the<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention programming logic is a software program but<br>
may also be hardcoded non-changeable procedural information such as typically<br>
found on an ASIC based device.<br>
Referring generally to Figure 5, a flow chart discloses one method for the<br>
programming logic that configures a device acting as improvement-node to attach to<br>
two peer to peer networks. This improvement-node accepts communication messages<br>
from nodes participating on one network and forwards them onto another network.<br>
Referring generally to Figure 6, a flow chart discloses one method for the<br>
programming logic that configures a device acting as an improvement-node to attach<br>
to the same peer to peer network twice. This improvement-node accepts<br>
communication messages from nodes participating on the network, changes the<br>
communication message radius parameters, and forwards the communication<br>
messages onto the same network.<br>
It may be advantageous to prevent transmission of communications from one<br>
network to the other, for instance if the operator of the improvement-node was trying<br>
to prevent copyright infringement requests from transversing the networks. In this<br>
case the programming logic can be configured to receive communication messages<br>
and compare them to criteria and to then perform some event whether or not a match<br>
is found. The programming logic may elect to drop the communication message and<br>
not pass it on to other networks. This election can be automatic depending on trigger<br>
points such as load or it can be configured to do so by the user of the programming<br>
logic.<br>
The method for comparing may include inter string, complete string, partial<br>
string, fuzzy logic, patricia tree or any other method that could be used to compare the<br>
likeness of two or more strings or portions of two or more strings. String comparison<br>
can occur in parallel with other searches to increase throughput or they can be<br>
compared serially (meaning one after another). If a match is made, the programming<br>
logic can drop the communication message if it is programmed to do so.<br>
In one such embodiment the improvement-node only forwards search and<br>
search response communication message while not forwarding other communication<br>
messages. In this embodiment the improvement-node would accept the<br>
communication message, decide if it is a search or a response to a search and then<br>
forward on or drop the communication message based on its findings.<br>
In another embodiment the improvement-node is functioning as a "repeater"<br>
so the communication message can travel further on the network then it normally<br>
would. In this case the improvement-node would accept the communication message<br>
from a node or network and set the communication message radius parameters to an<br>
optimal or near optimal value and retransmit the communication message.<br>
In another embodiment the improvement-node accepts all communication<br>
messages and forwards all communication messages. In this embodiment the<br>
improvement-node would accept all communication messages from one network and<br>
forward it to another network.<br>
In another embodiment the improvement-node accepts communication<br>
messages from a node and makes a request onto either the same network or a different<br>
network on behalf of the node. This would be useful in a caching environment or in<br>
an environment where the original node wished to hide its identity. The node would<br>
issue a communication message which the improvement-node would accept. The<br>
improvement-node would replace the original communication message with one of its<br>
own, making it appear as though it is sending the communication message for the<br>
benefit of itself. The improvement-node would maintain a table of node<br>
communication messages to "on behalf of' communication messages. As<br>
communication messages or services were returned to the improvement-node, the<br>
improvement node would look in this table for a correlation. It would then forward<br>
the communication messages or services to the original node.<br>
Examples<br>
The following Examples illustrate various embodiments of the methods<br>
according to the present Invention.<br>
Example 1: Referring to Figure 7, this example illustrates a method for<br>
connecting two networks together, accepting communication messages from one and<br>
forwarding it to another.<br>
In this example nodes A, B and C are on a first network and nodes E, F and O<br>
are on a second network. Each network is unable to communicate with each other<br>
because they speak different protocols. Node D is an improvement node and is part of<br>
both networks and can speak both protocols. Node A searches for a file named "A"<br>
and sends this search request to nodes B and C. Nodes B and C accept this search<br>
request. Node C forwards the search request to node D. D accepts the search request<br>
and forwards it to node E. Node E accepts the search request and forwards it to nodes<br>
FandG. Nodes F and G accept the search request. All nodes process the search<br>
request. Node O finds that it has the file and sends a response to node E. Node E<br>
forwards this response to node D. Node D forwards this response to node C. Node C<br>
forwards this response to node A. Node A receives the response from node O which<br>
is on another network.<br>
Example 2: Referring to Figure 8, this example illustrates a method for<br>
accepting communication messages from nodes participating on a single network,<br>
changing the communication message radius parameters, and forwarding the<br>
communication messages onto the same network.<br>
In this example all nodes are on one network and node C is an improvementnode<br>
and is configured to accept any communication messages, change the<br>
communication message radius parameters to an optimal or near optimal value and<br>
retransmit the communication messages.<br>
Node A is configured to send a search request no further than 3 hops away<br>
from where it is connected into the network. It sends the search to node B. Node B<br>
accepts the search and increments its hop value to 1 and forwards it to node C. Node<br>
C accepts the search and resets the hops value to 0 and forwards the search to node D.<br>
Node D accepts the search and increments its hop value to l and torwards tbe search<br>
to node E. Node E receives the search and increments its hop value to 2 and forwards<br>
the search to node F. Node F accepts the search. All node process the search request.<br>
Node F finds that it has the file and generates a response with a hop value of 0 and<br>
sends the response to node E. Node E accepts the response and increments the hop<br>
value to 1 and forwards this response to node D. Node D accepts the response and<br>
increments the hop value to 2 and forwards the response to node C. Node C accepts<br>
the response and changes the hop value to 0. Node C forwards the response to node<br>
B. Node B accepts the response and increments the hop value to 1 and then forwards<br>
the response to node A. Node A accepts the response. The end result is that even<br>
though Node G was 5 hops away it was still able to communicate with Node A.<br>
Example 3: Referring to Figure 7, example 3 illustrates a method for<br>
connecting two networks together, accepting communication messages from one,<br>
comparing it a list of criteria and dropping the communication message if it matches<br>
or forwarding it if it doesn't.<br>
In this example nodes A, B and C are on a first network and nodes E, F and G<br>
are on a second network. Each network is unable to communicate with each other<br>
because they use different protocols. Node D is an improvement-node and is part of<br>
both networks and can operate with both protocols. Node D is configured to drop<br>
searches for "Madonna,txt". Node A searches for a file named "Madonna.txt" and<br>
sends this search request to nodes B and C. Nodes B and C accept this search request.<br>
Node C forwards the search request to node D. Since node D is configured to drop<br>
searches that match "Madonna.txt" and because node A searched for "Madonna.txt"<br>
node D drops the search.<br>
Node A then searches for a file named "A" and sends this search request to<br>
nodes B and C. Nodes B and C accept the search request. Node C forwards the<br>
search request to node D. Since node D is configured to drop searches for<br>
"Madonna.txt" and because node A searched for "A" node D forwards the search<br>
request to node E. Node E accepts the search request and forwards it to nodes F and<br>
G. Nodes F and G accept the search request. All nodes process the search request.<br>
Node G finds that it has the file and sends a response to node E. Node E forwards this<br>
rcsponse to node D. Node D forwards this response to node C. Node C forwards this<br>
response to node A. Node A receives the response from node G which is on another<br>
network.<br>
Example 4: Again, referring to Figure 7, example 4 illustrates a method for<br>
connecting two networks together, accepting communication messages from one, and<br>
forwarding only searches and search responses and nothing else to another network.<br>
In this example nodes A, B and C are on a first network and nodes E, F and G<br>
are on a second network. Each network is unable to communicate with each other<br>
because they use different protocols. Node D is an improvement-node and is part of<br>
both networks and can utilize both protocols. Node A searches for a file named "A"<br>
and sends this search request to nodes B and C. Nodes B and C accept this search<br>
request. Node C forwards the search request to node D. D accepts the search request<br>
and forwards it to node E. Node E accepts the search request and forwards it to nodes<br>
F and G. Nodes F and G accept the search request. All nodes process the search<br>
request. Node G finds that it has the file and sends a response to node E. Node E<br>
forwards this response to node D. Node D forwards this response to node C. Node C<br>
forwards this response to node A. Node A receives the response from node G which<br>
is on another network.<br>
Node A then sends a ping request to nodes B and C. Node B receives the<br>
request and responds. Node C receives the request and responds. Node C forwards<br>
the ping request to node D. Because node D is configured to only forward search<br>
requests and responses it accepts the ping and responds but it does not forward the<br>
ping.<br>
Example 5: Referring to Figure 7, example 5 illustrates a method for<br>
accepting communications from a node on a first network and forwarding the<br>
communications onto a second network while making it appear that the original<br>
communications came from the improvement-node when in fact it did not For this<br>
example refer to Figure 7.<br>
In this example node D is the improvement node. Node C wishes to locate a<br>
file named "X" and sends a search request to node D. Node D accepts this search<br>
request and creates a new request with the same search terms but with its own address<br>
information. Node D stores this request in a table so that it knows that if any requests<br>
are received it should forward them to node C. Node D forwards this request to node<br>
E. Node E accepts the search request and finds that it has a match. Node E generates<br>
a response with node D's address information and forwards the response to node D.<br>
Node D accepts the response and looks in it tables and finds that this response was<br>
meant for node C so it forwards this response to Node C.<br>
