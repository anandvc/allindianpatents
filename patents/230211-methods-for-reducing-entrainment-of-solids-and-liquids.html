				<td>METHODS FOR REDUCING ENTRAINMENT OF SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS<br>
Inventors: Jack Chosnek, David William Ford, and Michael B. Lakin <br>
BACKGROUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is direct ed to processing sequences, refining sequences, and<br>
power-generation industries that employ separation devices in which non-vapors and vapors are<br>
to be separated. More particularly, the present invention is directed to cyclone/vortex methods<br>
for the separation of non-vapor and vapor components in distillation/flashing processes, and<br>
processes that benefit from a reduction of entrainment of liquids and solids in the vapor. Still<br>
further, the present invention is directed to processes for the reduction of catalyst loss during the<br>
separation of non-vapors and vapors.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In many distillation/flashing processes with mixed phase feed, entrainment of liquid<br>
droplets in the vapor rising from the feed zone is undesirable in terms of both economics and<br>
product purity. Problems concerning the entrainment of liquid materials in vacuum flasher units<br>
are well recognized in the art as represented by U.S. Patent No. 5,743,926 to Bannon et al. As<br>
noted in Bannon et al., trays may be placed directly above the feed zone to remove entrained<br>
droplets from vapor in hydrocarbon processing and refining. Bannon et al. further note that a<br>
disentrainment or wash-oil section may be incorporated in refineries to reduce entrainment<br>
problems by knocking liquid droplets out of a vapor stream as it proceeds to the vapor outlet of a<br>
vacuum flasher. Despite the methods claimed by Bannon et al., however, methods for reducing<br>
entrainment that are both effective and efficient from a costs stand-point remain lacking in<br>
industry.<br>
Another problem in terms of both economics and product purity is the entrainment in the<br>
vapor overhead of dissolved or suspended solids, such as catalyst(s). Entrained solids can be<br>
detrimental to product purity, or can foul downstream equipment. In addition, entrained solids<br>
can translate into a loss of a valuable chemical, such as a catalyst. In this regard, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,153,792 to Leet et al. discloses a process for the production of a carboxylic acid in the<br>
presence of solid catalyst particles that employs a flash step, using trays and a liquid wash. The<br>
liquid wash step disclosed by Leet et a . generally "washes" attrited catalyst particles in upward<br>
flowing vapors, downward in the flasher. U.S. Patent Nos..4,247,486 to Brewster et al. and<br>
4,287,369 to Harris et al. mention the loss of rhodium catalyst by entrainment in reactor<br>
overhead, and disclose the use of demisting pads to remove entrained liquid droplets for return<br>
to the reactor. Despite the methods claimed by Leet et al., Brewster et al., and Harris et al..<br><br>
methods for reducing entrainment of dissolved or suspended solids and loss of valuable<br>
chemicals such as catalysts that are both effective and efficient from a costs stand-point remain<br>
lacking in industry.<br>
Reducing the amount of cata yst lost through entrainment has been a concern in a wide<br>
variety of industries, as represented by U.S. Patent No. 4,166,773 to Higley et al.; U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,163,701 to Strong; and U.S. P atent No. 4,871,879 to Laird. None of these methods,<br>
however, have fulfilled the needs in industry.<br>
The method of the present invention fulfills multiple needs in industry: (1) a reduction<br>
of entrainment of liquids, and dissolved or suspended solids, in a separated vapor; (2) a<br>
reduction in the amount of valuable chemicals lost, as a result of the reduction of entrainment;<br>
(3) making it possible to use a smaller and less expensive separation vessel to reduce<br>
entrainment where before only a larger and more expensive vessel could be used for the same<br>
purpose; and (4) making it possible to retrofit existing separation vessels so as to achieve the<br>
reduction in entrainment without the need to build an entirely new vessel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, methods are provided for reducing entrainment of<br>
solids and liquids, collectively referred to as "non-vapor", in a vapor flow exiting a separation<br>
vessel. According to preferred methods of the present invention, one or more of the following<br>
steps may be performed to reduce the entrainment of non-vapor in a vapor flow exiting a<br>
separation vessel: (1) minimizing the climbing or creeping of the stream toward the vapor outlet<br>
along the inner surface of the separation vessel from the point of introduction of the stream; (2)<br>
reducing the amount of non-vapor, ii any, that exits from the separation vessel through the vapor<br>
outlet; and (3) maximizing the flow of the stream tangentially to the inner surface of the<br>
separation vessel, hereinafter referred to as "tangential coherency."<br>
The methods of the invention comprise introducing a stream into a separation vessel<br>
having an inner surface, at least one inlet, and at least one vapor outlet. The stream can be any<br>
mixture of vapor and non-vapor. The term "vapor" as used herein shall mean vapor and/or gas.<br>
The term "non-vapor" as used herein shall mean liquids, solids such as catalysts, and mixtures of<br>
liquids and solids, including solutions and suspensions. According to the methods of the<br>
invention, the stream contains at least one non-vapor and at least one vapor. The stream is<br>
introduced to the separation vessel through the inlet(s), where the velocity of the stream is<br>
reduced upon introduction into the separation vessel, and where the tangential coherency of the<br>
stream is maximized. Reducing the velocity of the incoming stream and maximizing its<br>
tangential coherency contributes to the minimization of the tendency of the stream to move<br>
along the inner surface of the separation vessel toward the vapor outlet and contributes to a<br>
reduction in entrainment.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, a vapor flow is separated from the<br><br>
stream in the separation vessel, and rises within the separation vessel at non-uniform vapor<br>
velocities. The vapor flow exits the separation vessel through the vapor outlet(s), moving at<br>
vapor flow exit velocities. Accordir g to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
non-uniform velocities at which the vapor flow flows within the separation vessel may be<br>
distributed to aid in reduction of entrainment of non-vapor and loss of valuable non-vapor<br>
components such as catalysts. The distribution of vapor velocities contributes to a reduction in<br>
the tendency of the stream to move along the inner surface of the separation vessel toward the<br>
vapor outlet, and also minimizes the vortex capabilities of the rising vapor flow, thereby<br>
reducing entrainment of non-vapor.<br>
According to further preferred embodiments of the present invention, the stream is<br>
guided along a path when it is introduced to the separation vessel such that tangential coherency<br>
is maximized, such that the tendency of the stream to move along the inner surface of the<br>
separation vessel toward the vapor outlet is minimized, and such that the amount of non-vapor<br>
that exits with the vapor flow through the vapor outlet(s) is minimized.<br>
Still further preferred embodiments of the present invention for reducing entrainment of<br>
non-vapor and loss of valuable non-vapor include controlling the vapor flow exit velocities such<br>
that the tangential coherency of the stream is maintained, such that the tendency of the stream to<br>
move along the inner surface of the separation vessel toward the vapor outlet is minimized, and<br>
such that the amount of non-vapor that exits, the separation vessel with the vapor flow through<br>
the vapor outlet(s) is minimized.<br>
According to still further preferred embodiments of the present invention, a cyclone, as<br>
known in the industry, can also be used in combination with other embodiments of the present<br>
invention to recover any of the non-vapor that exits the separation vessel with the vapor flow.<br>
The methods of the present invention are more fully explained in the following detailed<br>
discussion and examples.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and to FIG. 1 in particular, a separation vessel (3), with<br>
dual inlets (1) and (2) is illustrated. FIG. 2 shows a front view of a separation vessel (3) with<br>
dual inlets (1) and (2), a vapor outlet (6), a base (4), and an outlet (5).<br>
A stream is introduced into the separation vessel (3) through inlets (1) and (2). The<br>
number of inlet(s) used, the location of the inlet(s), and the diameter of the inlet(s) can be<br>
manipulated, as dictated by the geometry of the separation vessel, so as to reduce the velocity of<br>
the stream upon introduction into the separation vessel, so as to reduce the tendency of the<br>
stream to move along the inner surface of the separation vessel toward the vapor outlet, and to<br>
reduce entrainment of non-vapors.<br>
The diameter of the inlet(s) (1) and/or (2) preferably is such that tangential coherency of<br>
the incoming stream is maximized. Although the inlets (1) and (2) are shown in FIG. 2 as<br>
having a cylindrical geometry, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that inlets having<br>
other than a cylindrical geometry may also be used. Accordingly, a wide variety of geometries<br>
can be used to design the inlet(s). According to an alternate embodiment of the present<br>
invention, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the location of the inlets (1) and (2) can be varied so that the<br>
point of entry of inlet (1) is vertically displaced from the point of entry of inlet (2). Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the vertical displacement between inlets (1) and (2)<br>
can be widely varied, as dictated by the geometry of the separation vessel, so as to reduce the<br>
velocity and maximize the tangential coherency of the incoming stream, thereby achieving a<br>
reduction in entrainment.<br>
According to another alternate embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7, a plurality of inlets (1), (2), (12), and (13) can be used to reduce the velocity and<br>
maximize the tangential coherency of the incoming stream. As illustrated in FIG. 7, inlets (1)<br>
and (2) provide a tangential entry into the separation vessel (3), while inlets (12) and (13)<br>
provide a perpendicular entry. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that locations of<br>
inlets (1), (2), (12), and (13) are illustrative in nature, and that the inlets can be positioned<br>
anywhere along the outer perimeter of the separation vessel. Those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
will also recognize that the number of inlets used can be widely varied, as dictated by the<br>
geometry of the separation vessel, and by the benefits from a cost-standpoint.<br>
The ratio of non-vapor to vap or in the input stream preferably is such that the non-vapor<br>
is not so dispersed in the vapor that an accelerating force needs to be applied to the stream to<br>
form an agglomeration of the non-vapor. In another preferred embodiment, the velocity of the<br>
stream is reduced to a rate that does not cause the stream to break up when it contacts the wall of<br>
the separation vessel (3). It is prefer ed that, upon introduction into the separation vessel, the<br>
velocity of the stream is reduced to a rate that is less than the rate at which the breakup of the<br>
particles of non-vapor in the stream leads to entrainment of such non-vapor.<br><br>
Vapor separates from the stream and exits the separation vessel (3) through vapor outlet<br>
(6) at non-uniform vapor velocities that are dictated by the design of the separation vessel.<br>
Vapor can be separated from the stream by a reduction in pressure upon entry into the separation<br>
vessel, or by other methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To reduce and distribute<br>
the non-uniform vapor velocities within the separation vessel (3), a distribution tray (7)<br>
preferably is disposed within the separation vessel, as illustrated in FIG. 3. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distribution tray is a substantially planar<br>
sieve tray. Such a tray is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art will also recognize that trays that are not planar or substantially planar may also be<br>
used.<br>
The distribution tray (7) distributes the non-uniform velocity of the vapor within the<br>
separation vessel. The distribution tray (7), however, does not go so far as to equalize the<br>
non-uniform velocities because there will be local areas of different velocity at the perforated<br>
and solid portions of the distribution tray (7). The distribution of the non-uniform vapor<br>
velocities contributes to the reduction of entrainment because higher vapor velocities tend to<br>
carry more non-vapor than do lower vapor velocities. The distribution tray (7) also contributes to<br>
minimizing the tendency of the stream to move along the inner surface of the separation vessel<br>
(3) toward the vapor outlet (6).<br>
According to the methods of the present invention, when a tray (7) is used, it is disposed<br>
within the separation vessel (3) ard the velocity of the stream is maintained so that the stream<br>
does not contact or flood the tray 7). Preferably, the distance between the inlets (1) and (2) and<br>
the tray (7) is maximized while maintaining the distribution capabilities of the tray (7).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the tray (7) is located at a point that minimizes the<br>
vortex capability of the vapor, and causes the vapor to travel upwardly within the separation<br>
vessel (3). In still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, an irrigating stream of<br>
water, liquid, or other irrigating s ream is provided to the tray (7) to help reduce entrainment of<br>
non-vapor.<br>
As the vapor is separated from the incoming stream, non-vapor within the separation<br>
vessel (3) collects in the base (4) where it is maintained at a level (9) by controlling its release<br>
through the outlet (5). Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a wide variety of<br>
methods can be used to release the non-vapor through the outlet (5), and that the level (9)<br>
maintained can be varied as dictated by the geometry of the separation vessel. Although the<br>
separation vessel (3) is shown as having a simple cylindrical design, those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will recognize that vessels, having other geometrical configurations may be used.<br>
Accordingly, a wide variety of geometries can be used to design the separation vessel, including<br>
but not limited to, a tapering or widening of the base (4) with respect to the rest of the separation<br>
vessel (3). The level (9) in the base (4) of the separation vessel (3) preferably is maintained at a<br>
height that will provide for controlled release of the non-vapor from the separation vessel (3),<br><br>
and that minimizes the amount of nor -vapor in the base (4) entrained by the stream. Preferably,<br>
baffles (not illustrated) are included in the base (4) to minimize the rotational flow of the<br>
non-vapor in the base (4), thereby ass isting to minimize the entrainment of non-vapor in the base<br>
by the incoming stream. Baffles and features that have the same effects as baffles are well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferred that the entrainment of non-vapor in<br>
the base (4) by the incoming stream is minimized so as to contribute to the minimization the<br>
amount of non-vapor exiting with the vapor flow. These objectives of the invention are<br>
preferably accomplished by one or a combination of the following: locating the inlets (1) and<br>
(2), maintaining the level of non-vapor in the base (4), regulating the velocity of the incoming<br>
stream, distributing the non-uniforn vapor velocities within the separation vessel (3), and<br>
regulating the velocity of the exiting vapor. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that<br>
the location of the inlets (1) and (2) the level of non-vapor maintained in the base (4), the<br>
regulation of the velocity of the incoming stream, the distribution of the non-uniform vapor<br>
velocities within the separation vessel, and the regulation of the velocity of the exiting vapor,<br>
can each be subjected to a wide range of adjustments, and can each be adjusted independently of<br>
the others, so as to achieve the most preferable performance as dictated by the geometry of the<br>
separation vessel.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, inlet guides<br>
(8), may be disposed within the separation vessel to maximize the tangential coherency of the<br>
stream. The inlet guide(s) (8) have a first ledge (10) extending perpendicular to the inner surface<br>
of the vessel (3) and a second ledge (11) extending perpendicular to the first ledge (10) and<br>
concentrically with respect to the inner surface of the vessel (3). As shown in FIG. 4, the inlet<br>
guides (8) may be arcuate and con.oured along and to the inner surface of the separation vessel<br>
(3) so as to cover the point of entry of the inlet(s) (1) and (2). Preferably, the second ledge (11)<br>
extends for the entire length of the guide(s). The first ledge (10) of the guide(s) (8) preferably<br>
extends away from the inner surface of the separation vessel (3) for a distance that is<br>
approximately the same as the diameter of the inlet(s) (1) and/or (2). Preferably, the inlet<br>
guide(s) (8) circumscribe an arc of from abcut 60 to 120 degrees. Most preferably, the inlet<br>
guide(s) (8) circumscribe an arc of from about 90 to 120 degrees. Those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will recognize that the geometry and configuration of the inlet guide(s) (8) can be varied as<br>
dictated by the design of the separation vessel.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the extension of the guide(s) (8)<br>
outward into the separation vessel can be widely varied for the most preferable performance as<br>
dictated by the geometry of the separation vessel. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also<br>
recognize that the guide(s) (8) may not be arcuate and that the guide(s) (8) may be placed in a<br>
variety of positions, configurations, and angles, including a slight decline, as dictated by the<br>
geometry of the separation vessel (3), so as to achieve the maximum reduction in entrainment.<br><br>
Since superficial velocities are responsible for entrainment once a specific droplet or<br>
particle size distribution is formed, a larger-diameter vapor outlet (6), which contributes to a<br>
reduction in the velocity of the exiting vapor, may also be used to reduce entrainment of<br>
non-vapor. The diameter of the vapor outlet affects the velocity of the exiting vapor. In terms<br>
of the design for any separation vessel, according to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the disengagement of the in et(s) and the vapor outlet is maximized. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize hat the number of vapor outlet(s) used, their location,<br>
their diameter, and their geometric cor figuration can be adjusted and varied as dictated by the<br>
geometry of the separation vessel, and by the benefits from a cost-standpoint, the achieve the<br>
maximum reduction in entrainment.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the vapor outlet (6) is fed to a cyclone (not illustrated)<br>
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As is conventional in the art, the cyclone<br>
collects any liquids and solids entrained in the exiting vapor flow. The fluids or solids collected<br>
by the cyclone can be recirculated or stored, according to the particular refining or processing<br>
sequence in operation.<br>
According to the present invention, the reduction of entrainment can be accomplished by<br>
one or more of the following methods (1) reducing the velocity of the incoming stream by<br>
adjusting the number of inlet(s) used, he location of the inlet(s), and the diameter of the inlet(s);<br>
(2) maximizing the tangential coherency of the incoming stream by reducing its velocity and/or<br>
guiding it along a path when it is introduced to the separation vessel; (3) minimizing the<br>
tendency of the stream to move along the inner surface of the separation vessel toward the vapor<br>
outlet by reducing its velocity and/or by guiding it along a path when it is introduced to the<br>
separation vessel and/or by distributing vapor velocities within the separation vessel; and (4)<br>
reducing vapor flow exit velocities by adjusting the number of outlet(s), the location of the<br>
outlet(s), and the diameter of the outlet(s).<br>
The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the<br>
following examples. The examples are merely illustrative of the methods of the present<br>
invention and are not intended to be 1imiting.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In gas/liquid processes, liquid entrainment in the form of sprays and mists are a result of<br>
droplet formation created by one or n.ore of several mechanisms such as agitation, condensation,<br>
and pressure changes accompanied by flashing. In such processes, a major contributing factor to<br>
liquid entrainment is the drop size and distribution. Droplets created in high turbulence or<br>
velocity applications such as atomize is, quenching, flashing, and distillation, are usually a<br>
function of the energy or power per unit mass.<br>
The size of the separation vessel depends on the processes and equipment being used, as<br>
well as the physical properties of the liquids, vapors, gases and solids being used. The following<br><br>
examples relate to the application of the process of the invention to a commercial flasher. A<br>
scaled-down model of a commercial flasher was. fabricated to conduct the tests discussed in the<br>
examples. In a flasher like the subject commercial flasher, energy is supplied to the liquid by<br>
high-velocity flashing vapor. The scale-down of vapor rates by kinetic energy, and liquid rates<br>
by mass were estimated for the model dasher unit as follows.<br>
For the gas phase, the kinetic energy scaling was expressed by the capacity factor<br>
definition used in distillation, which is closely related to the Souders-Brown correlation for<br>
demisters. The liquid phase scale-down was based on equivalent mass ratios between the<br>
commercial and the model unit. Drop size is dependent on physical properties of the system.<br>
For a gas/liquid system, the drop size is also dependent on power per unit mass in a turbulent<br>
flow regime. Entrainment is an exponential function of superficial velocity.<br>
Because of the high rates of flow of the incoming stream generally used for operation in<br>
a separation vessel, the present invention sought a method by which to lower inlet velocities and<br>
distribute vapor velocities so that: (1) a tangential coherency of the inlet stream was created and<br>
maintained; (2) creepage of the inlet stream along the inner surface of the separation vessel<br>
toward the vapor outlet was reduced; (3) the amount of non-vapor from the incoming stream that<br>
exited with the vapor flow was reduced; and (4) the amount of non-vapor entrained by the<br>
incoming stream from the base of the separation vessel was minimized.<br>
In the model flasher, a vapor distribution tray having 0.5 inch diameter holes and a hole<br>
area of 13.5% was used. The area ac jacent to the wall of the vessel did not have holes to a<br>
distance of about 1.75 inch from the wall. The tray had 519 holes having a ½ inch diameter with<br>
a 1.1 inch triangular pitch.<br>
A 14-1/2 inch acrylic plastic cyclone was designed and piped to the outlet of the flasher<br>
in some test runs. The outlet of the cyclone was piped to a demister/vane arrangement contained<br>
in an acrylic plastic box. This setup facilitated, observation of the effectiveness of the methods<br>
of the invention, as the bottom of the cyclone caught all of the measurable entrainment.<br>
In some test runs, the tray was irrigated with 1.5 gallons per minute (gpm) of water,<br>
(noted in Table has "1.5 gpm rinse.")<br>
In some test runs, salt was used to simulate solids, such as catalysts, dissolved or<br>
suspended within the non-vapor in the incoming stream, (noted in Table I as "salt.")<br>
When the flow was split into two inlet pipes, each had a 4-3/4 inch nominal diameter.<br>
When the inlets were enlarged, a 6 inch nominal diameter acrylic plastic pipe was used, (noted<br>
in Table I as "split inlet 6.")<br>
When guides were tested, arcuate contoured guides between 60 and 120 degrees were<br>
used, (noted in Table I as "guides.')<br>
The main observations from the runs made with the model separation vessel were:<br>
•	When increasing gas rates on the incoming stream, the break point for increased<br>
entrainment seemed to be around 800 actual cubic feel per minute (acfm), for both cases<br><br>
of trayed and untrayed flasher, although the increase was exponential only when the tray<br>
was present, apparently because liquid v/etted the bottom of the tray.<br>
An irrigated tray reduced entrainment of salt (used to simulate dissolved solids such as<br>
catalysts) by about 80% when compared to the base case (no trays), although total liquid<br>
entrainment was not reduced, but rather increased.<br>
Two inlets having a 4-3/4 inch nominal diameter significantly reduced entrainment. The<br>
addition of a non-irrigated distribution tray reduced the entrainment to about zero (up to<br>
a given gas rate).<br>
With two inlets having a 4-3/4 inch nominal diameter and a tray, there was a sudden,<br>
dramatic increase in entrainment at about 1,260 acfm when the liquid rate was increased<br>
from about 52 to 60 gpm. It was observed that the tray appeared to flood at that point. It<br>
was further observed that addition of a rinse to the tray started the flooding at lower gas<br>
rates.<br>
With two enlarged (6 inch nominal) inlets, no measurable entrainment could be seen up<br>
to, and including, the highest combination of liquid and gas rates in the range studied.<br>
With a tray present there also was no visible entrainment, and, additionally, there was<br>
less splashing present.<br>
Flow guides over the inlet were effective in stopping entrainment at the higher rates. A<br>
90° guide appeared to perform better than a 120° guide.<br><br>
Table I: Model Unit Run Results<br>
The number 1.5 when a tray is present refers to a rinse rate or irigation of about 1.5 gpm.<br>
The 6 inch notation next to "inlet" refers to an enlarged inlet(s).<br>
The "single" notation or a lack of notation next to "inlet" refers to a test vessel using only one<br>
inlet.<br><br><br><br>
It should be noted that although tests were run on a model separation vessel that provided<br>
for a tangential entry of the stream into the separation vessel, the method of the invention is also<br>
applicable to vessels where the actual entry of the stream into the vessel is not tangential. A<br>
tangential entry is not the focus or object of the invention, but rather an object is the<br>
maximization of tangential coherency once the stream has been introduced to the vessel.<br>
Furthermore, although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described, a<br>
wide range of modification, change, and substitution is intended in the disclosure herein, and in<br>
some instances, some features of the present invention may be employed without a<br>
corresponding use of the other features Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims<br>
be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention.<br><br>
