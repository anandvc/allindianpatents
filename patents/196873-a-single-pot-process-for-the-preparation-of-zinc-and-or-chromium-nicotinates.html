				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a single-pot process for the preparation of zinc and/ or chromium nicotinates useful as a dietary supplement from beta picoline.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In 1996, according to WHO and the International Diabetes Federation there were 132 million diabetic patients worldwide and will increase to 240 millions in 2010. Diabetes is a serious disease that we need to cure.<br>
Trivalent chromium, element in a trace amount, is needed for the metabolism of sugar, protein and fat in the human body. The deficiency of this trace element causes diabetes. It is distributed in many tissues in human body, with liver and kidney containing the highest amount.<br>
According to a report published in the National Academy of Sciences, Page 160, 1980, only 0.5% of ingested inorganic chromium is assimilated into the body. Also, only 1-2% of most organic chromium compounds is assimilated into the body, whereas the synthetic coordination complex of picolinic acid with chromium is directly available for absorption without competition from other metals as reported in US Patent No. RE 33988 (Reissued on July 7, 1992).<br>
US published patent application no. 2002 098247 and published PCT application no. WO 02/36202 discloses that chromium nicotinate composition is used to improve insulin sensitivity, reduces hyperglycemia and reduces hypercholesterolemia.<br>
US Patent No. 6379693 and US Pat No. 6203819 reveals that chromium nicotinate can be supplemented to the patients for curing diabetes and according to US Pat No. 5194615 it can also be used as Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF) material. Chromium nicotinate is also<br>
reported as a feed supplement to cattle to improve the milk production (US Pat No.6139881).<br>
Zinc, a trace element in the human body, is known to participate in the development of sexual organs, promotion of wound healing, activating the immune system and to be a component of metalloenzyme, an accelerator for dehydrogenase. Conventionally zinc oxide formulations have been topically used as medicines for treating skin diseases such as dermatitis, sunburn, neurodermatitis and eczema. These formulations have local astringent action and irritation and are not usually administered internally. US Pat No. 5582817 and US Pat No. 5696169 reported that zinc nicotinate can be used as cosmetics and as a drug for ameliorating sunburn and skin diseases, preventing sunburn, relieving irradiation disorders etc.<br>
In the prior art of preparation of chromium nicotinate US Pat No. 5194615 and US Pat No. 4923855 suggested the use of an alkali metal salt of nicotinic acid which is reacted with a trivalent chromium salt After the completion of reaction, the precipitated chromium complex is filtered and dried.<br>
Further, US Pat No. 5696169 and US Pat No. 5582817 discloses the preparation of zinc nicotinate complex by reacting nicotinic acid with zinc acetate dihydrate and adjusting the pH to 8.5. However these patents use nicotinic acid and chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate or zinc acetate dihydrate as the starting material for the manufacturer of chromium nicotinate or zinc nicotinate, respectively.<br>
Alkylpyridines can be oxidised by chemical agents such as KMnO4 but these reagents are expensive and can lead excessive oxidation and there by ring degradation [J. Org. Chem. 14, 14 (1949); J. Chem. Soc. 934 (1946)] and lot of MnO2 as solid waste is generated which has it's own problems in disposal. Other methodologies include nitric acid oxidation, which is reported as a more economical route, but it requires elevated temperature and pressure [Bengtsson, Acta. Chem. Scand.; 9, 832 (1955)]. These harsh conditions cause decarboxylation and thus resulting yield loss of pyridine carboxylic acid. US Pat. No. 2437938 reports catalytic air oxidation, but doesn't appear to have general application.<br>
US Patent No. 2522163 relates to preparation of pyridine carboxylic acids from sulfates of alkyl pyridine, quinoline, isoquinolines and alkyl quinolines. The invention is illustrated by an example wherein the preparation of nicotinic acid from beta picoline(3-picoline) is described.<br>
US Pat. No. 2513099 discloses a process for oxidising N-heterocycle compounds containing a pyridine nucleus and an oxidizable organic group attached to the nitrogen containing aromatic nucleus by at least one carbon to carbon linkage. The process involves oxidation by reacting nitric acid with a solution containing the N-hetrocycle compound and a mixture of mercury and copper compounds dissolved in sulphuric acid. This process of oxidation may normally lead to the contamination of undesired metals with the nicotinic acid. While the prior art techniques for preparing chromium nicotinate and zinc nicotinate have been reasonably successful, the preparation is rather complex. These techniques involve multi-steps, which makes the product expensive.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to produce chromium nicotinate and zinc nicotinate from a cheaper raw material (beta picoline) and using a single pot process.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel single pot process for the preparation of metal nicotinates using beta picoline as a source of starting material.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use metal nicotinates as a dietary supplement.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a single pot process for the preparation of metal nicotinates as a dietary supplement, with high purity from beta picoline as a cheaper source of raw material.<br>
Statement of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a single pot process for the preparation of zinc and / or chromium nicotinates useful as dietary supplements from beta picoline, said process comprising the steps of:<br>
( a )        hydrosulfonation of beta picoline with sulfuric acid at a temperature in the<br>
range of 35 - 100°C to form a reaction mixture; ( b )       further heating the reaction mixture obtained in step (a) to a temperature<br>
of 150 to 210°C; ( c)        oxidizing the reaction mixture of step (b) with an oxidizing agent such as<br>
herein described under proper ventilation to remove nitric oxide fumes for<br>
a time period in the range of 18 to 22 hours to obtain nicotinic acid sulfate<br>
at a temperature ranging from 35 to 90°C to form a solution; ( d )        maintaining the pH of the solution of step (c) of 7 to 8 as a basic solution<br>
using an alkali solution; ( e)       treating the basic solution of step (d) with a water soluble zinc and / or<br>
chromium salt to produce a solid metal nicotinate in said water; and (f)         filtering the resulting solid metal nicotinate of step (e) to remove such<br>
from   said   water   and   to   thereby   obtain   the   corresponding   metal<br>
nicotinates.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
1.0 kg beta picoline is slowly added to concentrated sulphuric acid under agitation. After complete addition, the reaction mass temperature is raised to 180° C and 7.6 kg of 56% nitric acid is added and the temperature is maintained at 180-190° C for 20 hrs. After complete oxidation, the reaction mixture is cooled to an ambient temperature and diluted with 5.0 Kg water. After dilution, the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 7.0 to 8.0 by the addition of aqueous ammonia solution. The resulted solution is heated to 80-90° C and a hot solution of 600 g chromium (III) chloride in 2.5 kg water added over a period of 2-6 hrs at 80-90° C. The whole mass is stirred at 80-90° C for further half an hour. The resulting mass is brought to an ambient temperature and the product is collected by filtration and washing. After drying 980 g of purple coloured chromium nicotinate, having 12.7% chromium content, is obtained and 335 g beta picoline is recovered from the filtrate.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
Example 1 was repeated by adopting the same procedure but chromium (III) acetate is used in place of chromium (III) chloride.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
Example 1 is repeated by adopting the same procedure but chromium (III) oxalate is used in place of chromium (III) chloride.<br>
EXAMPLE-4<br>
Example 1 is repeated up to the oxidation step by adopting the same procedure and the reaction mass is diluted with 5.0 kg water. After dilution the pH of the solution is adjusted to 7.0-8.0 by the addition of liquid ammonia solution.
