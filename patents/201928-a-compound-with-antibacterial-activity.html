The present invention is concerned with a method effective to prevent or treat bacterial infections in warm-blooded animals which comprises administering to them a pharmacologically effective amount of a compound described above.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
 -lactam antibiotics, amino-glycosides, quinolone carboxylic acids, isoniazids and rifampicin have conventionally been used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial infections.  Recently a lot of bacteria have become resistant to these antibiotics. It is desirable to develop new compounds which have different types of mechanism of antimicrobial action from the conventional ones.<br>
On the other hand, it has been known that capuramycin, having the formula shown below, exhibits anti acid-fast bacillus activity without cross-resistance to conventional medicaments. However, its antibacterial activity is not ootent enough to enable its use as an antibacterial agent, (J. Antibotics, 29, (8), 1047-1053 (1986)).<br><br>
After many compounds were prepared by chemical modification of capuramycin, the present inventors made intensive studies on their pharmacological activities for several years. As a result, they have found that compounds of formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof exhibit<br><br>
2<br>
excellent antibacterial activity without cross-resistance to conventional medicaments and are therefore useful as a medicament effective to prevent and treat bacterial infections, and they have accomplished the present invention.<br>

271<br>
be further purified by a conventional technique such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or chromatography.<br>
In Step H3, a compound of formula (H3) is synthesized by removal of the protecting group, Rs, of the hydroxyl group of the compound of formula (H2). This step is carried out by reaction of the compound (H2) with an agent for removal of the protecting group Rs in an inert solvent.<br>

On the other hand, Compounds (V!) and (VII), which are used as starting materials in Methods A to C, are available by the method described in WO00/02892. In<br><br>
272<br>
other words, they are obtained by culturing a microorganism belonging to the<br>
Streptomyces spp., producing the said compounds in a proper medium, and then<br>
collecting the compounds from the cultured broth.  Streptomyces griseus Strain<br>
SANK60196 (which will hereinafter be called "Strain SANK60196"), which is a<br>
preferred microorganism capable of producing Compounds (VI) and (VII), has been<br>
collected and separated from the soil of Mt. Tsukuba/lbaraki-ken in a manner known to<br>
those skilled in the art. The mycological properties of Strain SANK60196 are as<br>
follows:	:<br>
1)	Morphological appearance<br>
Strain SANK60196 showed the morphological appearance as described below after cultivation at 28°C for 14 days on a medium specified by the International Streptomyces Project (which will hereinafter be abbreviated as "ISP") (refer to Shirling, E.B. and Gottlieb, D., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 16, 313-340(1996)). Observation through an optical microscope indicates that the substrate mycelia of SANK60196 are favorably grown and branched and show yellowish gray, yellowish brown or pale olive color, but are different from the strain belonging to Nocardia spp., in that they are free from cleavage or zigzag extension. Aerial mycelia exhibit simple branching. The form of the spore chain is straight or curved and its chain is formed of 10 to 50 or greater spores. Observation through a scanning electron microscope shows that the spore has an oval shape and it has a smooth surface structure. The spore is 0.6-0.8 x 0.7-1.2 mm in dimension. The spore is formed only on the aerial mycelia.  Formation of sporangia, axial division of aerial mycelia, cleavage of aerial mycelia and sclerotia are not recognized.<br>
2)	Growth characteristics on various culture media<br>
The growth characteristics of Strain SANK60196 on an agar medium after cultivation at 28°C for 14 days are as described below in Table 4.  In the Table, the composition of the medium attached with fSP No. is as specified by ISP.  In the items, the abbreviations G, AM, R and SP stand for growth, aerial mycelia, reverse color and soluble pigment, respectively. The color tone is described in accordance with "Color Standards", ed. by Japan Color Laboratory. The indication of the color tone in parentheses is a color number in accordance with the Munsell color system. The pale yellow soluble pigment, produced in a water-agar medium changes into colorless by 0.05N hydrochloric acid, but shows no change by 0.05N aqueous sodium hydroxide.<br><br>

4) Chemotaxonomic properties<br>
The cell wall of the present strain was investigated in accordance with the method of Hasegawa, et al. (refer to Hasegawa, T., et al.. The Journal of General and Applied Microbiology, 29, 319-322(1983)), resulting in the detection of L,L-diaminopimelic acid. The main sugar component in the whole cells of the present strain was investigated in accordance with the method of M.P. Lechevalier (refer to Lechevalier, M.P., Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, 71, 934-944(1968)). As a result, no characteristic component was detected.<br>
The above-described mycolcgical properties have revealed that the present strain belongs to Streptomyces spp. among the Actinomyces.  It has been made clear that the present strain is markedly related to Streptomyces griseus, as a result of comparison with the the microorganism described in the ISP strains by Shirling and Gottlieb (refer to Shirling, E.B. and Gottlieb, D., International Journal of Systematic<br><br>
276<br>
Bacteriology, 18, 68-189 and 279-392(1968); 19, 391-512(1969); 22, 265-394(1972)), the microorganism described in "The actinomycetes Vol. 2" written by Waksman (refer to Waksman, S.A., "The actinomycetes 2 (1961)"), the microorganism described in Bergey's Manual edited by Buchanan and Gibbons (refer to R.E. Buchanan and N.E. Gibbons, "Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology", 8th edition (1974)), the microorganism described in "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology", edited by Williams (refer to Williams, ST., et al., "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology 4 (1989)") and the microorganism described in the recent literature about Actinomyces belonging to Streptomyces spp.  It has however been recognized to be different from Streptomyces griseus, because it produces a yellowish gray soluble pigment on a glycerin  asparagine agar medium and a pale yellowish brown soluble pigment on a peptone  yeast extract  iron agar medium but produces a soluble pigment neither on a potato extract  carrot extract agar medium nor on a water agar medium; the maximum growth temperature is 40°C; and it is grown in the presence of 7% of salt.<br>
The present strain having such mycological characteristics is considered to be a novel strain different from Streptomyces griseus, but it is impossible to distinguish them based on only the above-described differences. The present inventors therefore identified the present strain as Streptomyces griseus SANK60196.<br>
This strain was internationally deposited with Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry (1-3, Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305, JAPAN) as of February 22, 1996 and deposited under the name of FERM BP-5420.      <br>
A description of Strain SANK60196 is given above.  It is known that various properties of Actinomyces are not fixed but easily change naturally or artificially. The strain usable in the present invention embraces all such variants.  In other words, the present invention embraces all strains belonging to the Streptomyces spp. and capable<br>
of producing the compounds of formulae (VI) or (VII).<br>
As a medium usable for cultivation of microorganisms capable of producing the compounds of formulae (VI) or (VIl) of the present invention, any synthetic or natural medium can be used insofar as it contains, as needed, a substance selected from carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic ions and organic nutrition sources.<br><br>
277<br>
As such nutrition sources, known carbon sources, nitrogen sources and inorganic salts conventionally employed for the cultivation of a strain of the Eumycetes or Actinomycetes and are assimilable by a microorganism can be used.<br>
Specific examples of carbon sources include glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, mannitol, glycerol, dextrin, oats, rye, corn starch, potato, corn flour, soybean powder, cotton seed oil, thick malt syrup, theriac, soybean oil, citric acid and tartaric acid. They may be used either singly or in combination. The amount of the carbon source to be added usually varies, but is not limited to, within a range of from 1 to 10 wt.% of the amount of the medium.<br>
As the nitrogen source, a substance containing protein or hydrolyzates thereof can usually be employed. Preferred examples of the nitrogen source include soybean powder, wheat bran, peanut flour, cotton seed flour, skimmed milk, casein hydrolyzate, Farmamine (product of Sheffield Chemical), fish flour, corn steep liquor, peptone, meat extract, raw yeast, dry yeast, yeast extract, malt extract, potato, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate.  It is preferred to use the nitrogen source either singly or in combination in an amount ranging from 0.2 to 6 wt.% of the amount of the medium.<br>
As the nutrition inorganic salt, ordinarily employed salts from which an ion is available, such as sodium salts, ammonium salts, calcium salts, phosphates, sulfates, chlorides and carbonates can be used.  In addition, trace metals such as potassium, calcium, cobalt, manganese, iron and magnesium are usable.<br>
For the production of the compounds of formulae (VI) or (VII), the addition of cobalt, skimmed milk or yeast extract is particularly effective.<br>
Upon culturing the microorganism capable of producing the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII), an antibiotic biosynthesis inhibitor can be added. The compounds of formulae (VI) and (Vll) can be produced, for example, by using, as a medium additive, S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine or a salt thereof which is an aspartate kinase inhibitor, singly or in combination with cobalt, skimmed milk or yeast extract. A combination of the said medium additive with skimmed milk especially accelerates production of the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII). The additive can be added to give its final concentration ranging from 1 to 100 mM. Preferably, use of it to give a final concentration of 10 mM permits; favorable production of the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII).<br>
Upon liquid culture, a silicone oil, vegetable oil or surfactant can be added as an antifoamer.<br><br>
278<br>
The medium used for the cultivation of Strain SANK60196 to produce the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) preferably has a pH of 5.0 to 8.0.<br>
The growth temperature of Strain SANK60196 is 12 to 36°C.  It is preferred to cultivate the strain at 18 to 28°C in order to produce the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII), of which 19 to 23°C is more preferred.<br>
The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) are available by aerobic culture of Strain SANK60196. As such a culturing method, ordinarily-employed solid culture, shake culture, and aeration agitation culture can be used.<br>
For small-scale culturing, agitation culture for several days at 19 to 23°C is preferred.  Culturing is started from a growing step of seed cultures in the first to second stage in an Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a baffle (water flow adjusting wall) or an ordinarily-employed Erlenmeyer flask. As a medium in the seed culture growing stage, a carbon source and a nitrogen source can be used in combination. The seed flask may be shaken at 19 to 23°C for 5 days in a thermostat incubator or shaken until the seed cultures grow sufficiently. The seed cultures thus grown are used for inoculation on the second seed medium or a production medium. When the seed cultures under an intermediate growing step are used, they are allowed to grow essentially in a similar manner, followed by inoculation of a part of them on a production medium. The flask into which the seeds have been inoculated is subjected to shake culture at a constant temperature for several days and after completion of the culturing, the cultured product in the flask is centrifuged or filtered.<br>
For large-scale culturing, on the other hand, culturing in a jar fermenter or tank equipped with a stirrer and an aeration apparatus is preferred.  Prior to culturing in such a container, the culture medium is heated at 121 to 130°C for sterilization. After cooling, the seed cultures which have been allowed to grow in advance by the above-described method are inoculated on the sterilized medium. Then, aeration and agitation is effected at 19 to 23°C for culturing. This method is suited for obtaining a large amount of the desired compounds.<br>
The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) can be produced by adding, as an aspartate kinase inhibitor, an aqueous solution of S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine or salt thereof which has been filter sterilized in advance to a sterilized medium at the commencement of the cultivation or during cultivation.<br>
The amount of the compouncs of formulae (VI) and (VII) produced with the passage of cultivation can be measured by sampling a portion of the cultured broth and<br><br>
279<br>
subjecting it to high performance liquid chromatography. The production amount of the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) usually reaches a peak in 3 to 15 days.<br>
After completion of the cultivation, the cell component is separated from the cultured broth by filtration with the aid of diatomaceous earth or by centrifugation. The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VIl) present in the filtrate or supernatant are purified by utilizing its physicochemical properties with HPLC analytical data as an index. As diatomaceous earth, "Celite 545" (trade name; product of Celite Corporation) is preferably used. The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) present in the filtrate can be purified by using adsorbents singly or in combination, for example, activated charcoal and an adsorbing resin such as "Amberlite XAD-2 or XAD-4" (trade name; product of Rohm &amp; Haas), and "Diaion HP-10, HP-20, CHP-20P, HP-50 or SP207" (trade name; product of Mitsubishi Chemical). The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) can be separated by causing a solution containing them to pass through the layer of such an adsorbent, and removing the impurities adsorbed thereto from the solution; or by eluting the adsorbed compounds with aqueous methanol, aqueous acetone, aqueous normal butanol, aqueous ammonia, aqueous methanol containing ammonia or aqueous acetone containing ammonia.<br>
The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) thus obtained can be purified by adsorption column chromatography using a carrier such as silica gel, "Florisil" (trade name), "Cosmosil" (trade name; product of Nacalai Tesque), or "Diaion CHP-20P or SP207" (trade name; product of Mitsubishi Chemical); gel filtration chromatography using "Sephadex GH-10" (trade name; product of Pharmacia Biotech) or'Toyopearl HW40F" (trade name; product of TOSOH Corp); anion exchange chromatography using "Dowexi or SBR-P" (trade name; product of Dow Chemical) or "Diaion PA316" (trade name; product of Mitsubishi Chemical), or high performance liquid chromatography using a normal phase or reversed phase column; or the like.<br>
The compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) according to the present invention can be separated and purified by using the above-exemplified separation and purification means singly or in combination as needed, or in some cases, by using one of them in repetition.<br>
Typical preparation processes for the compounds of formula (I), an ester, ether or N-alkyl derivative thereof, and the compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII) which are used as a starting material have been described above, but preparation processes are not limited thereto and other processes already known to those skilled in the art may also be employed.<br><br>
280<br>
Compounds of formula (I), esters, ethers and N-alkyl derivatives thereof thus obtained are novel compounds not published in the literature and show potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  Examples of Gram-positive bacteria against which these compounds are expected to show potent antibacterial activity, include Mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulae, Mycobacterium kansaii, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Bacillus subtilis and Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyrogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Examples of Gram-negative bacteria against which these compounds are expected to show potent antibacterial activity, include Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. Out of these, more potent antibacterial activity is demonstrated against Mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulae, Mycobacterium kansaii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br>
Their growth inhibitory activity against general Gram positive bacteria or Gram negative bacteria can be determined by the disk assay method using normal agar medium (product of Eiken Chemical) or heart infusion agar medium (product of Difco Laboratories). Growth inhibitory activity against Mycobacteria, Gram positive bacteria belonging to the Actinomycetales, can be determined similarly on the above-described medium added further with glycerin.<br>
Typical evaluation methods of biological activity of Compound (I) are described above, but the evaluation method is not limited thereto: other evaluation methods already known to those skilled in the art can also be employed.<br>
The compound of formula (I) of the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, ether or N-alkyl derivative thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be administered alone or as a mixture of said compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable exciplent or diluent in various forms which include tablets, capsules, granules, powders, syrups, injections, ointments, liquids and solutions, suspensions, aerosols, troches and the like.  Medicaments of the present invention can be administered orally or parenterally. But it is preferable that Compound (I), an active<br><br>
281<br>
component or a pharmaceutical!;/ acceptable salt thereof is administered by delivery to the lung or airway (including spraying in the mouth and intranasal administration).<br>
These formulations can be prepared, in a conventional manner, by adding, to a medicament, ordinarily employed carriers known in the field of pharmaceutical formulation technique such as an excipient, binder, disintegrator, lubricant, corrigent, adjuvant for solubilization, suspending agent, coating agent and/or the like.<br>
For the formation of tablets, various carriers known conventionally in this field can be employed.  Examples include excipients such as lactose, sucrose, sodium chloride, glucose, urea, starch, calcium carbonate, kaolin, crystalline cellulose and silicic acid; binders such as water, ethanol, propanol, simple syrup, glucose solution, starch solution, gelatin solution, carboxymethylcellulose, shellac, methylcellulose, potassium phosphate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone; disintegrators such as dry starch, sodium alginate, agar powder, laminaran powder, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearic acid monoglyceride, starch and lactose; disintegration suppressants such as sucrose, stearin, cacao butter and hydrogenated oil; absorption facilitators such as quaternary ammonium salts and sodium lauryl sulfate; humectants such as glycerin and starch; adsorbents such as starch, lactose, kaolin, bentonite and colloidal silicic acid; and lubricants such as purified talc, stearates, boric acid powder and polyethylene glycol. Tablets can be formed as those having ordinary coating as needed such as sugar coated tablets, gelatin encapsulated tablets, enteric coated tablets, film coated tablets, or double or multiple layer tablets.<br>
For the formation of pills, various carriers conventionally known in this field can be used. Examples include excipients such as glucose, lactose, cacao butter, starch, hardened vegetable oil, kaolin and talc; binders such as gum arabic powder, tragacanth powder, gelatin and ethanol; and disintegrators such as laminaran agar.<br>
For the formation of suppositories, various carriers conventionally known in this field can be employed.  Examples include polyethylene glycol, cacao butter, higher alcohols and esters thereof, gelatin and semi-synthetic glyceride.<br>
Upon formulation as injections, it is preferred that solutions or suspensions are sterilized and they are made isotonic with the blood. Solutions, emulsions or suspensions can be formed using any diluent conventionally used in this field. Examples include water, ethanoi, propylene glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxylated isostearyl alcohol and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester.  It is also possible to incorporate, in a pharmaceutical preparation, salt, glucose or glycerin in an<br><br>
282<br>
amount sufficient for preparing an isotonic solution, or to add an ordinarily employed adjuvant for solubilization, buffer, sootning agent and/or the like.<br>
When liquids and solutions, and suspensions are used for a pulmonary drug delivery system, aqueous solutions and suspensions are adopted and they are prepared using water alone (for example, sterilized or pyrogen-free water) or water and a physiologically acceptable solvent for example ethanol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol including PEG 400).  It is also possible to incorporate, in liquids and solutions, and suspensions, additional excipients including antiseptics (for example benzalkonium chloride), adjuvants for solubilization (for example polysorbate)/surfactants (for example Tween 80, Span 80, benzalkonium chloride), buffers, isotonicity regulating agents (for example sodium chloride), absorption facilitators, viscosity increasing agents and/or the like.  It is also possible to incorporate, in suspensions, suspending agents (for example fine crystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose).  Liquids and solutions, and suspensions are directly administered intranasally or sprayed in the mouth by ordinary methods using syringes, pipettes and atomizers. These pharmaceutical preparations can be administered as single or multiple doses.  In the latter case, use of a dose measuring device is preferable. When a syringe or pipette is used, the dose needed for a patient can be administered by application of a prescribed volume of liquids and solutions, and suspensions. When an atomizer is used, it works with a metered-dose spray pump as a dose measuring device. Administration to the airway or lung can be performed by a pressurized aerosol canister with a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC, for example dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane or dichlorotetrafluoroethane), carbon dioxide or another suitable gas propellant. An aerosol formulation containing surfactants such as lecithin is preferred. The dose can be controlled by a metered valve.<br>
For the formation of powders for a pulmonary drug delivery system, the    o compound may be mixed with dry powder.  Examples include lactose, starch and starch derivatives (for example hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).  It is preferable that carrier particles form gel in nasal.  Powders can be administered in a unit dose form such as a capsule or cartilage which is made of gelatin, or a blister pack (from which powders can be administered using an inhaler). In powders for a pulmonary delivery system including nasal formulations, the particle size is generally small, for example, not more than 5 urn. The particle size can be<br><br>

obtained by methods already known in the art, such as ultra-pulverization.  If necessary, powders which continuously release an active ingredient may be used.<br>
If necessary, a colorant, preservative, flavor, sweetener or other medicaments may be incorporated.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the content of the compound incorporated as an active ingredient in the above-described pharmaceutical preparation.  It can be chosen suitably from a wide range.  In general, it is desired to be contained in an amount of 1 to 70 wt.%, preferably 1 to 30 wt.% in the whole composition.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the method of administration of the above-described pharmaceutical preparation and it is determined depending on the dosage form or age, sex or other conditions of a patient to be administered or seriousness of the disease of the patient.  For example, tablets, pills, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules or capsules are administered orally.  Injections are administered intravenously either alone or as a mixture with an ordinarily employed fluid such as glucose or an amino acid.  If necessary, they are alone administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracutaneously or intraperitoneally. A suppository is administered rectally.<br>
Although the dose of the active ingredient differs with the conditions, age, and weight of the patient, administration route or dosage form, the daily dose usually ranges from 2000 mg (preferably 100 mg) as the upper limit to 0.1 mg (preferably 1 mg, more preferably 10 mg) as the lower limit per adult.  It can be administered once or in several portions a day according to the conditions.<br><br>

The minimum inhibitory corcentration (MICs) of the test compounds against Mycobactehum tuberculosis was determined by the broth dilution method.  After the solution of a test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or distilled water was diluted with 50% aqueous acetone or distilled water, each two-fold dilution of the solution was carried out with Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% dextrose and Middlebrook ADC enrichment. The final concentrations of DMSO and acetone did not exceed 0.05% and 2.5% respectively. The microorganisms cultivated on Ogawa medium were suspended uniformly in Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% dextrose and Middlebrook ADC enrichment. The microorganism solution was adjusted to about 1 x 107 CFU/rr.L using a spectrophotometer. The resulting microorganism solution was further diluted with Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% dextrose and Middlebrook ADC enrichment (final viable cell count: about 1 x 105 CFU/rnL). After mixing the diluted microorganism solution with the diluted test compound solution in the test tube, cultivation was performed at 35°C for 10 - 21 days. When significant growth was found in the control test tube with no test compound, the MIC was determined as the minimum concentration of the compound at which no colony was recognized microscopically in the test tube.<br>
