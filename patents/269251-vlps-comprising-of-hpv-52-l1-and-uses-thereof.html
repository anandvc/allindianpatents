FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the prevention and/or therapy of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. More specifically, the present invention relates to synthetic polynucleotides encoding HPV 52 LI protein, and to recombinant vectors and hosts comprising said polynucleotides. This invention also relates to HPV 52 virus-like particles (VLPs), wherein the VLPs are produced by expressing recombinant HPV 52 LI or LI + L2 in yeast cells and to their use in vaccines and pharmaceutical compositions for preventing and treating HPV infections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are more than 80 types of human papillomavirus (HPV), many of which have been associated with a wide variety of biological phenotypes, from benign proliferative warts to malignant carcinomas (for review, see McMurray et al., Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 82(1): 15-33 (2001)). HPV6 and HPV11 are the types most commonly associated with benign warts, nonmalignant condyloma acuminata and/or low-grade dysplasia of the genital or respiratory mucosa. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are the high-risk types most frequently associated with in situ and invasive carcinomas of the cervix, vagina, vulva and anal canal. More than 90% of cervical carcinomas are associated with infections of HPV 16, HPV 18 or the less prevalent oncogenic types HPV31, -33, -45, -52 and -58 (Schiffman et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 85(12): 958-64 (1993)). The observation that HPV DNA is detected in 90-100% of cervical cancers provides strong epidemiological evidence that HPVs cause cervical carcinoma (see Bosch et al., J. Clin. Pathol. 55: 244-265 (2002)).<br>
Papillomaviruses are small (50-60 nm), nonenveloped, icosahedral DNA viruses that encode up to eight early and two late genes. The open reading frames (ORFs) of the viral genomes are designated El to E7, and LI and L2, where "E" denotes early and "L" denotes late. LI and L2 code for virus capsid proteins, while the E genes are associated with functions such as viral replication and cellular transformation.<br>
The LI protein is the major capsid protein and has a molecular weight of 55-60 kDa. The L2 protein is the minor capsid protein. Immunological data suggest that most of<br><br>
the L2 protein is internal to the LI protein in the viral capsid. Both the LI and L2 proteins are highly conserved among different papillomaviruses.<br>
Expression of the LI protein or a combination of the LI and L2 proteins in yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells or bacteria leads to self-assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) (for review, see Schiller and Roden, in Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses; Lacey, ed. Leeds, UK: Leeds Medical Information, pp 101-12 (1996)). VLPs are morphologically similar to authentic virions and are capable of inducing high litres of neutralizing antibodies upon administration into animals or humans. Because VLPs do not contain the potentially oncogenic viral genome, they present a safe alternative to the use of live virus in HPV vaccine development (for review, see Schiller and Hidesheim, J. Clin. Virol. 19: 67-74 (2000)). For this reason, the LI and L2 genes have been identified as immunological targets for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines for HPV infection and disease.<br>
HPV vaccine development and commercialization have been hindered by difficulties associated with obtaining high expression levels of capsid proteins in successfully transformed host organisms, limiting the production of purified protein. Therefore, despite the identification of wild-type nucleotide sequences encoding HPV LI proteins such as HPV 52 LI protein, it would be highly desirable to develop a readily renewable source of crude HPV LI protein that utilizes HPV 52 LI-encoding nucleotide sequences that are optimized for expression in the intended host cell. Additionally, it would be useful to produce large quantities of HPV 52 LI VLPs having the immunity-conferring properties of the native proteins for use in vaccine development.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions and methods to elicit or enhance immunity to the protein products expressed by HPV 52 LI genes. Specifically, the present invention provides polynucleotides encoding HPV 52 LI protein, wherein the polynucleotides have been codon-optimized for high level expression in a yeast cell. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is altered to eliminate transcription termination signals that are recognized by yeast.

As used throughout the specification and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
As used throughout the specification and appended claims, the following definitions and abbreviations apply:<br>
The term "promoter" refers to a recognition site on a DNA strand to which the RNA polymerase binds. The promoter forms an initiation complex with RNA polymerase to initiate and drive transcriptional activity. The complex can be modified by activating sequences termed "enhancers" or "upstream activating sequences" or inhibiting sequences termed "silencers".<br>
The term "vector" refers to some means by which DNA fragments can be introduced into a host organism or host tissue. There are various types of vectors including plasmids, viruses (including adenovirus), bacteriophages and cosmids.<br>
The term "cassette" refers to a nucleotide or gene sequence that is to be expressed from a vector, for example, the nucleotide or gene sequence encoding the HPV 52 LI protein. In general, a cassette comprises a gene sequence inserted into a vector which, in some embodiments, provides regulatory sequences for expressing the nucleotide or gene sequence. In other embodiments, the nucleotide or gene sequence provides the regulatory sequences for its expression. In further embodiments, the vector provides some regulatory sequences and the nucleotide or gene sequence provides other regulatory sequences. For example, the vector can provide a promoter for transcribing the nucleotide or gene sequence and the nucleotide or gene sequence provides a transcription termination sequence. The regulatory sequences which can be provided by the vector include, but are not limited to, enhancers, transcription termination sequences, splice acceptor and donor sequences, introns, ribosome binding sequences, and poly(A) addition sequences.<br><br>
The designations "52 LI wild-type sequence" and "52 LI wt sequence" refer to the HPV 52 LI sequence disclosed herein as SEQ ID NO:3. Although the HPV 52 LI wild-type sequence has been described previously, it is not uncommon to find minor sequence variations between DNAs obtained from clinical isolates. Therefore, a representative HPV 52 LI wild-type sequence was isolated from clinical samples previously shown to contain HPV 52 DNA (see EXAMPLE 1). The HPV 52 LI wild-type sequence was used as a reference sequence to compare the codon-optimized HPV 52 LI sequences disclosed herein (see FIGURE 1).<br>
The designations "HPV 52 LI R" and "52 LI R" refer to an exemplary synthetic HPV52 LI nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID N0:l), disclosed herein, wherein the sequence was rebuilt so that it comprises codons that are preferred for high-level expression by a yeast cell.<br>
The term "effective amount" means sufficient vaccine composition is introduced to produce the adequate levels of the polypeptide, so that an immune response results. One skilled in the art recognizes that this level may vary.<br>
A "conservative amino acid substitution" refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by another, chemically similar, amino acid residue. Examples of such conservative substitutions are: substitution of one hydrophobic residue (isoleucine, leucine, valine, or methionine) for another; substitution of one polar residue for another polar residue of the same charge (e.g., arginine for lysine; glutamic acid for aspartic acid).<br>
The term "mammalian" refers to any mammal, including a human being.<br>
"VLP" or "VLPs" mean(s) virus-like particle or virus-like particles.<br>
"Synthetic" means that the HPV 52 LI gene was created so that it contains a sequence of nucleotides that is not the same as the sequence of nucleotides present in the designated naturally occurring wild-type HPV 52 LI gene (52 LI wt, SEQ ID NO:3). As stated above, synthetic molecules are provided herein comprising a sequence of nucleotides comprising codons that are preferred for expression by yeast cells. The synthetic molecules provided herein encode the same amino acid sequences as the wild-type HPV 52 LI gene (SEQ ID NO:2).<br>

Ten, five and two and one-half micrograms of total yeast protein extract were denatured aad applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was Western transferred. HPV 52 Ll protein was detected on the resulting blot using a yeast-absorbed anti-trpE-HPV 31 Ll goat polyclonal antiserum which cross-reacts with HPV 52 Ll and HPV 16 Ll. Molecular weight markers are indicted in kDa on the left. The arrow indicates the position of the ~ 55 kDa HPV 52 Ll protein.<br>
FIGURE 5 shows a representative sample of HPV 52 VLPs composed of HPV 52 Ll R protein molecules, described herein, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy (see EXAMPLE 7). The diameter of the spherical particles in this crude sample ranged from between 40 and 70 nm with some particles displaying a regular array of capsomers. The bar represents approximately 0.1 mm.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The majority of cervical carcinomas are associated with infections of specific<br><br>
more than one codon, a phenomenon known as codon redundancy. For reasons not completely understood, alternative codons are not uniformly present in the endogenous DNA of differing types of cells. Indeed, there appears to exist a variable natural hierarchy or "preference" for certain codons in certain types of cells. As one example, the amino acid leucine is specified by any of six DNA codons including CTA, CTC, CTG, CTT, TTA, and TTG. Exhaustive analysis of genome codon use frequencies for microorganisms has revealed endogenous DNA of E. coli most commonly contains the CTG leucine-specifying codon, while the DNA of yeasts and slime molds most commonly includes a TTA leucine-specifying codon. In view of this hierarchy, it is generally believed that the likelihood of obtaining high levels of expression of a leucine-rich polypeptide by an E. coli host will depend to some extent on the frequency of codon use. For example, it is likely that a gene rich in TTA codons will be poorly expressed in E. coli, whereas a CTG rich gene will probably be highly expressed in this host. Similarly, a preferred codon for expression of a leucine-rich polypeptide in yeast host cells would be TTA.<br>
The implications of codon preference phenomena on recombinant DNA techniques are manifest, and the phenomenon may serve to explain many prior failures to achieve high expression levels of exogenous genes in successfully transformed host organisms~a less "preferred" codon may be repeatedly present in the inserted gene and the host cell machinery for expression may not operate as efficiently. This phenomenon suggests that synthetic genes which have been designed to include a projected host cell's preferred codons provide an optimal form of foreign genetic material for practice of recombinant protein expression. Thus, one aspect of this invention is an HPV 52 LI gene that is codon-optimized for high-level expression in a yeast cell. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, it has been found that the use of alternative codons encoding the same protein sequence may remove the constraints on expression of HPV 52 LI proteins by yeast cells.<br>
In accordance with this invention, HPV 52 LI gene segments were converted to sequences having identical translated sequences but with alternative codon usage as described by Sharp and Cowe (Synonymous Codon Usage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast 7: 657-678 (1991)), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The methodology generally consists of identifying codons in the wild-type sequence that are not commonly associated with highly expressed yeast genes and replacing them with optimal codons for<br><br>
high expression in yeast cells. The new gene sequence is then inspected for undesired sequences generated by these codon replacements (e.g., "ATTTA" sequences, inadvertent creation of intron splice recognition sites, unwanted restriction enzyme sites, high GC content, presence of transcription termination signals that are recognized by yeast, etc.). Undesirable sequences are eliminated by substitution of the existing codons with different codons coding for the same amino acid. The synthetic gene segments are then tested for improved expression.<br>
The methods described above were used to create synthetic gene segments for HPV 52 LI, resulting in a gene comprising codons optimized for high-level expression. While the above procedure provides a summary of our methodology for designing codon-optimized genes for use in HPV vaccines, it is understood by one skilled in the art that similar vaccine efficacy or increased expression of genes may be achieved by minor variations in the procedure or by minor variations in the sequence.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a synthetic polynucleotide comprising a sequence of nucleotides encoding an HPV 52 LI protein, or a biologically active fragment or mutant form of an HPV 52 LI protein, the polynucleotide sequence comprising codons optimized for expression in a yeast host cell. Said mutant forms of the HPV 52 LI protein include, but are not limited to: conservative amino acid substitutions, amino-terminal truncations, carboxy-terminal truncations, deletions, or additions. Any such biologically active fragment and/or mutant will encode either a protein or protein fragment which at least substantially mimics the immunological properties of the HPV 52 LI protein as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2. The synthetic polynucleotides of the present invention encode mRNA molecules that express a functional HPV 52 LI protein so as to be useful in the development of a therapeutic or prophylactic HPV vaccine.<br>
One aspect of this invention is a codon-optimized nucleic acid molecule which encodes the HPV 52 LI protein as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, said nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence of nucleotides that are codon-optimized for high-level expression in a yeast cell. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a sequence of nucleotides as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors and recombinant host cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, which contain the nucleic acid molecules disclosed<br><br>
throughout this specification. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the host cell is a yeast host cell.<br>
The synthetic HPV 52 LI DNA, functional equivalents thereof, and fragments thereof, constructed through the methods described herein may be recombinantly expressed by molecular cloning into an expression vector containing a suitable promoter and other appropriate transcription regulatory elements. Said expression vector may be transferred into prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells to produce recombinant HPV 52 LI protein. Techniques for such manipulations are fully described in the art (Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, (1989); Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., Green Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York (1988); Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual, Rose et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, (1990), which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety).<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a process for expressing an HPV 52 LI protein in a recombinant host cell, comprising: (a) introducing a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an HPV 52 LI protein into a yeast host cell; and (b) culturing the yeast host cell under conditions which allow expression of said HPV 52 LI protein.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for expressing an HPV 52 LI protein in a recombinant host cell, comprising: (a) introducing a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding an HPV 52 LI protein into a yeast host cell; wherein the nucleic acid molecule is codon-optimized for optimal expression in the yeast host cell and; (b) culturing the yeast host cell under conditions which allow expression of said HPV 52 LI protein.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for expressing an HPV 52 LI protein in a recombinant host cell, comprising: (a) introducing a vector comprising a nucleic acid as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 into a yeast host cell; and, (b) culturing the yeast host cell under conditions which allow expression of said HPV 52 LI protein.<br>
The synthetic genes of the present invention can be assembled into an expression cassette that comprises sequences designed to provide efficient expression of the HPV 52 LI protein in the host cell. The cassette preferably contains the synthetic gene, with related transcriptional and translational control sequences operatively linked to it, such as a promoter, and termination sequences. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter is the S.<br><br>
cerevisiae GAL1 promoter, although those skilled in the art will recognize that any of a number of other known yeast promoters such as the GAL 10, GAL7, ADH1, TDH3 or PGK promoters, or other eukaryotic gene promoters may be used. A preferred transcriptional terminator is the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator, although other known transcriptional terminators may also be used. The combination of GAL1 promoter - ADH1 terminator is particularly preferred.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is an HPV 52 virus-like particle (VLP) produced by recombinantly expressing the HPV 52 LI or LI + L2 genes in a yeast cell, methods of producing HPV 52 VLPs, and methods of using HPV 52 VLPs. VLPs can self-assemble when LI, the major capsid protein of human and animal papillomaviruses, is expressed in yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells or bacteria (for review, see Schiller and Roden, in Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses; Lacey, ed. Leeds, UK: Leeds Medical Information, pp 101-12 (1996)). Morphologically indistinct HPV VLPs can also be produced by expressing a combination of the LI and L2 capsid proteins. VLPs are composed of 72 pentamers of LI in a T=7 icosahedral structure (Baker et al, Biophys. 7.60(6): 1445-56(1991)).<br>
VLPs are morphologically similar to authentic virions and are capable of inducing high titres of neutralizing antibodies upon administration into an animal. Immunization of rabbits (Breitburd et al., 7 Virol. 69(6): 3959-63 (1995)) and dogs (Suzich et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Scl USA 92(25): 11553-57 (1995)) with VLPs was shown to both induce neutralizing antibodies and protect against experimental papillomavirus infection. Additionally, immunization of adult women with HPV 16 VLPs was shown to protect against HPV 16 infection and HPV 16 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (Koutsky et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 347: 1645-51 (2002)). Because VLPs do not contain the potentially oncogenic viral genome and can self-assemble when expressed from a single gene, they present a safe alternative to the use of live virus in HPV vaccine development (for review, see Schiller and Hidesheim, 7. Clin. Virol. 19: 67-74 (2000)).<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to virus-like particles comprised of recombinant LI protein or recombinant LI + L2 proteins of HPV 52, wherein the recombinant protein is expressed in a yeast cell.<br><br>

The following examples illustrate, but do not limit the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Determination of a Representative HPV 52 LI Sequence<br>
The HPV 52 LI sequence has been described previously (Genbank Accession # NC 001592). It is not uncommon, however, to find minor sequence variations between DNAs obtained from clinical isolates. To determine a representative HPV 52 LI wild-type sequence, DNA was isolated from three clinical samples previously shown to contain HPV 52 DNA. HPV 52 LI sequences were amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase and the following primers: 5' LI 5'-ATGTCCGTGTG GCGGCCTAGT- 3'(SEQ ID NO:4) and 3' 52 Bel II 5'-GAGATCTCAAT TACACAAAGTG-3' (SEQ ID N0:5). The amplified products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The ~ 1500 bp LI bands were excised and DNA was purified using Geneclean Spin Kit (Q-Bio Gene, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA was then ligated to the TA cloning vector, pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). TOPI OF' E. coll cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and plated on LB agar with kanamycin plus IPTG and X-gal for blue/white colony selection. The plates were inverted and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C.<br>
Colony PCR was performed on five white colonies originating from each of the three clinical isolates amplified. 5' LI and 3' 52 Bgl II primers were used in a two-step PCR in which the first step comprised 10 cycles of 96°C for 15 seconds (denaturing), 55°C for 30 seconds (annealing) and 68°C for 2 minutes (extension), and the second step<br><br>
comprised 35 cycles of an essentially similar program, except the annealing step was performed at 50°C for 30 seconds. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Several colonies from each clinical isolate contained amplified products with -1500 bp bands. The colonies were cultured in LB medium with kanamycin, shaking at 37°C for 16 hours. Minipreps were performed to extract the plasmid DNAs, which were digested with restriction endonucleases to demonstrate the presence of the LI gene in the plasmid. The resulting restriction fragments were viewed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.<br>
DNA sequencing was performed on plasmids containing cloned LI inserts from each of the three clinical isolates. DNA and translated amino acid sequences were compared with one another and the previously published Genbank HPV 52 LI sequences. Sequence analysis of the three clinical isolates revealed that no sequence was identical to the Genbank sequence (Accession No. NC 001592). The pCR2.1 HPV 52L1 clone #2C was chosen to be the representative HPV 52 LI sequence and is referred to herein as the "52 LI wild-type sequence" (SEQ ID NO:3, see FIGURE 1). The sequence chosen as 52 LI wild-type (wt) contained one point mutation when compared to the Genbank sequence, which consisted of a silent mutation at nucleotide 1308 (adenine —»• guanine). The amino acid sequence of the HPV 52 LI wt sequence was identical to the 52 LI Genbank sequence.<br>
The HPV 52 LI wild-type sequence was amplified using the 5' LI Bgl II primer (5' -GAGATCTCACAAAACAAAATGTCCGTGTGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO:6)) and the 3' 52 Bgl II primer described above to add Bgl II extensions. PCR was performed using Taq polymerase. The PCR product was electrophoresed on an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The ~ 1500 bp band was excised and DNA was purified using the Geneclean Spin kit (Q-Bio Gene, Carlsbad, CA). The PCR product was then ligated to the pCR2.1 vector and TOPiOF' cells were transformed with the ligation mixture. White colonies were cultured in LB medium with kanamycin, shaking at 37°C for 16 hours. Minipreps were performed to extract the plasmid DNA. The HPV 52 LI gene was released from the vector sequences with Bgl II restriction endonuclease digestions. The digested DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and viewed by ethidium bromide staining. The LI band was purified using the Geneclean kit and ligated to a dephosphorylated, BamHl-digested pGALHO vector. TOP10F' E.coli cells were<br><br>
transformed with the ligation mixture. To screen for the HPV 52 LI insert in the correct orientation, plasmid DNA from the colonies was PCR-amplified. DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm the sequence and orientation of the inserts. The selected clone was named pGALHO-HPV 52L1 #5. Maxiprep DNA from the selected clone was prepared. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were made competent by spheroplasting with glusulase and transformed with pGALllO-HPV 52L1 #5. The yeast transformation mixture was plated in Leu- sorbitol top-agar on Leu- sorbitol plates and incubated inverted for 3-5 days at 30°C. Colonies were picked and streaked for isolation on Leu- sorbitol plates. Isolated colonies were subsequently grown in 5 ml of 5 X Leu- Ade- sorbitol with 1.6% glucose and 4% galactose in rotating tube cultures at 30 °C to induce HPV 52 LI transcription and protein expression.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Yeast codon optimization<br>
Yeast-preferred codons have been described (Sharp, Paul M and Cowe, Elizabeth. Synonymous Codon Usage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae YEAST 7: 657-678 (1991)). Expression of the HPV 52 LI wt protein was detectable; however, the level of transcription was very low and not detectable by Northern blot. It was postulated that pre-mature transcription termination may be responsible for the low expression levels of the HPV 52 LI gene. To increase transcription of this gene and ensure full-length transcripts would be produced, the HPV 52 LI gene was rebuilt utilizing yeast-preferred codons. The sequence was inspected for the presence of yeast transcription termination signals that are recognized by yeast, and these sequences were eliminated by substitution with alternative codons, while preserving the same amino acid sequence. The rebuilt HPV 52 LI sequence, which comprises yeast codon-optimized sequences, contained 379 nucleotide alterations compared to the HPV 52 LI wt sequence. The resulting sequence is referred to herein as "52 LI R" (R - rebuild, see FIGURE 1). The nucleotide alterations between the 52 LI wt (SEQ ID N0:3) and 52 LI R (SEQ ID NO:1) sequences are shown in FIGURE 1. The translated amino acid sequence of 58 LI R was not altered (SEQ ID NO:2, see FIGURE 2). The rebuilt sequence provides increased HPV 52 LI protein expression, which is a significant advance over the wild-type for use in vaccine development.<br><br>
The strategy employed to produce the optimized gene was to design long overlapping sense and antisense oligomers that span the gene, substituting nucleotides with yeast-preferred codon sequences while maintaining the amino acid sequence. These oligomers were used in place of template DNA in a PCR reaction with Pfu DNA polymerase. Additional amplification primers were designed and used to amplify the rebuilt sequences from template oligomers.<br>
The optimal conditions for amplification were section-specific; however, most reactions employed a program resembling 94°C for 5 minutes (denaturing) followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec (denaturing), 50-55°C for 30 sec (annealing), 72°C for 1.5 minute (extension), followed by a 72°C for 7 minute final extension and 4°C hold. PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands of the appropriate size were excised and the DNA was purified from the gel slice. The amplified fragments were then used as templates to assemble the 1512 nt rebuilt HPV 52 LI gene.<br>
Following rebuild, the 1512 nt band was gel purified, and ligated to pCR4 Blunt vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following ligation, competent E. coli TOP 10 cells were transformed with the ligation mixture. Colonies were grown in 4 ml LB with ampicillin and plasmid DNA was extracted from the colonies by miniprep techniques. The plasmid DNA was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired HPV 52 LI rebuild changes. To add BamHl extensions to both ends, the 52 LI R (rebuild) was re-amplified from pCR4Blunt-52 LI R. The amplified fragment was cloned as above and the resulting plasmid DNA was sequenced. The plasmid, pCR4 Blunt-52 LI R (Bam) was digested with BamRl and the resulting DNA fragment inserts were electrophoresed on an agarose gel. The -1530 bp HPV 52 LI R (Bam) fragment was gel purified and ligated to BamHl-digested pGALl 10. TOP10F' E.coli (Invitrogen) cells were transformed with the ligation mixture.<br>
The resulting colonies were screened by PCR for the HPV 52 LI R insert in the correct orientation. Sequence and orientation were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Maxiprep plasmid DNA was prepared. S. cerevisiae cells were made competent by spheroplasting and transformed. The yeast transformation was plated in Leu- sorbitol top-agar on Leu- sorbitol agar plates and incubated inverted for 7 days. Colonies were picked and streaked for clonal isolation on Leu- sorbitol agar plates. Isolated colonies were<br><br>
subsequently grown in 5 ml of 5 X Leu- Ade- sorbitol with 1.6% glucose and 4% galactose in rotating tube cultures at 30°C to induce LI transcription and protein expression. After 48 and/or 72 hours, a culture volume equivalent to an OD600 = 10 was pelleted, the supernatant was removed and the pellets were frozen and stored -70°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 RNA preparation<br>
Cell pellets of transformed yeast induced to express HPV 52 LI by galactose induction were thawed on ice, suspended in 0.8 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gibco BRL) and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. One fifth volume of chloroform was added to the vial. It was then shaken vigorously for 15 seconds to mix and incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes. After a 5 minute centrifugation at 13 k rpms, the upper phase was collected and transferred to a new vial. 0.4 ml isopropanol was added to the vial. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. To pellet the RNA, centrifugation was performed at 13 k rpms for 10 minutes. The supernatant was decanted, the RNA pellet washed with 75% EtOH and the centrifugation step was repeated. The supernatant was decanted and the RNA pellet was allowed to air dry for 15 minutes followed by suspension in RNase-free water. Spectrophotometry was performed to determine the concentration of RNA in the sample using the assumption that an A260 reading of 1 = 40 mg/ml RNA when the A260/280 is 1.7-2.0.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Northern Blot Analysis<br>
A 1.1% agarose formaldehyde gel was cast. Five and ten micrograms of RNA were combined with denaturing buffer (final concentrations: 6% formaldehyde, 50% formamide and 0.1 x MOPS) and heated to 65°C for 10 minutes. A one-tenth volume of gel loading buffer was added and the sample was loaded onto the gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 75 volts in 1 x MOPS buffer for ~ 3 hours. The gel was washed for 60 minutes in 10 x SSC.<br>
The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) by capillary action over 16 hours in 10 x SSC. The RNA<br><br>
was then fixed to the nylon membrane by cross-linking using the Stratagene UV Stratalinker auto crosslink function (Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA). After fixing, the nylon membrane was allowed to air dry.<br>
The Roche DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit I (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) was used to label 52 LI wt and 52 LI R DNA sequences with DIG to be used as probes to detect 52 LI wt and 52 LI R RNA on the Northern blot. The pre-hybridization, hybridization, and immunological development using an anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody were performed per the manufactures recommendations. Briefly, the blot was pre-hybridized at 37°C for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. The probe was denatured by heating to 95°C for 5 minutes and subsequent quenching on ice. The probe was added to the hybridization solution and applied to the membrane for 4 hours at 44.6°C with gentle shaking. The hybridization solution was then removed and the blot was washed 2 x for 5 minutes in 2 x SSC with 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by an additional wash at 65°C with 0.5 x SSC and 0.1% SDS. The blot was then blocked for 30 minutes and anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody was applied at a 1:5000 dilution for 30 minutes. The blot was washed and the presence of probe-bound RNA was determined by NBT/BCIP substrate detection of the alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-DIG bound antibody.<br>
Initial analysis of yeast expressing HPV 52 LI wt suggested that HPV 52 LI protein was expressed; however, the level was low. Northern blot analysis of RNA from yeast extracts of cultures induced to express HPV 52 LI wt did not reveal any detectable HPV 52 LI RNA, Since some protein of the appropriate size was detected, it was clear that some full-length RNA transcripts were made. The HPV 52 LI gene was rebuilt with yeast-preferred codon sequences and was engineered to omit any possible premature transcription termination sites to ensure robust transcription. Northern blot analysis of the HPV 52 LI R transcript revealed that full-length transcripts were generated and detectable by Northern blot analysis (FIGURE 3).<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
HPV 52 LI Protein Expression<br><br>
Frozen yeast cell pellets of galactose-induced cultures equivalent to OD600= 10 were thawed on ice and suspended in 300 ml of PC buffer (100 mM Na2HPO4 and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.0) with 2mM PMSF, Acid-washed 0.5mm glass beads were added at a concentration of ~ 0.5g/tube. The tubes were vortexed for 3 cycles of 5 minutes at 4°C with a 1 minute break. 7.5 ml of 20% TritonXlOO was added and the vortex step was repeated for 5 minutes at 4°C, The tubes were placed on ice for 15 minutes, followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a sterile microcentrifuge tube, which was labeled as total yeast protein extract, dated, and stored at -70°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 Western Blot Analysis<br>
Total yeast protein extract from twenty isolated yeast colonies for each HPV 52 LI construct were analyzed by Western blot to confirm expression of HPV 52 LI protein after galactose induction.<br>
Ten, five, and two and one-half micrograms of total yeast protein extract were combined with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated to 95°C for 10 minutes. The HPV 16 L1 protein, which is approximately 55 kDa, was included as a positive control, along with HPV LI-free total yeast protein extract as a negative control (data not shown). The proteins were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed in Tris-Glycine buffer. After protein separation, the proteins were Western-transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose and the resulting blot was blocked in 1 x diluent buffer (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 hour at room temperature with rocking. The blot was washed three times and yeast absorbed goat anti-trpE-HPV 31 LI serum, which cross-reacts with HPV 16 and HPV 52 LI proteins, was applied at room temperature for 16 hours. The blot was then washed three times and incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of anti-goat-HRP conjugated antibody for 1 hr. The blot was again washed three times and NBT/BCIP detection substrate was applied (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). Immunoreactive proteins were detected as purple bands on the blot.<br>
In all cases, the HPV 52 LI protein was detected as a distinct imrmmoreactive band on the nitrocellulose corresponding to approximately 55 kDa. (FIGURE 4) The intensity<br><br>
of the HPV 52 LI R band (2.5 mg lane) appeared to be significantly greater than the HPV 52 LI wt band (10 mg). It was clear that upon rebuilding, the expression level of codon-optimized HPV 52 LI R increased more than four-fold, which is the limit of direct comparison on the Western blot.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy<br>
To demonstrate that the 52 LI protein was in fact self-assembling to form pentameric-Ll capsomers, which in turn self-assemble into virus-like particles, a partially purified HPV 52 LI R protein extract was subjected to transmission electron microscopy (TEM).<br>
Yeast were grown under small scale fermentation and pelleted. The resulting pellets were subjected to purification treatments. Pellet and clarified yeast extracts were analyzed by immunoblot to demonstrate HPV 52 LI protein expression and retention throughout the purification procedure. Clarified yeast extracts were then subjected to centrifugation over a 45%-sucrose cushion and the resulting pellet was suspended in buffer for analysis of HPV 52 LI VLPs by TEM.<br>
A representative sample of the HPV 52 LI R VLPs produced is shown in FIGURE 5. The diameter of the spherical particles in this crude sample ranged from between 40 and 70 nm with some particles displaying a regular array of capsomers.<br><br>
