JOURNAL SEAL FOR ROLLING BEARINGS<br>
The invention concerns a roll neck seal for roll bearings, where the roll neck seal has:<br>
-- an annular seal body, which is nonrotatably connected with a roll neck with its bearing surface oriented coaxially with the roll axis and with at least two spaced webs that face away from the axis of the roll and that are in direct or indirect contact with an annular projection of the roll bearing, and<br>
-- a reinforcing element for reinforcing the seal body.<br>
Neck seals of this type are preferably used for sealing roll neck bearings in rolling mills.  They are intended to prevent oil from escaping from the bearing and to prevent foreign materials, for example, coolant or mill scale, from penetrating the bearing.  The high speeds of rotation of the rolls of a mill train cause correspondingly high loads on the bearings and the sealing devices due to the effects of centrifugal force.  To counteract the effects of the centrifugal force, the seal bodies are reinforced with a reinforcing element.  The reinforcing element is incorporated in the seal body or is arranged externally between the spaced webs.  Figures la to If show various known embodiments of neck<br>
 <br>
seals.<br>
EP 1 625 897 Bl discloses a seal for the tapered section of a roll neck of a rolling stand.  The seal comprises a flexible circular seal body with a central axis and at least one   flange that extends radially outward, which flange is connected by a connecting bridge to an  angularly extending lip, which has converging first and second side's.  The connecting bridge has a reduced thickness compared to the thickness of the flange and the lip.  The converging first and second sides of the lip lead to an enlarged rim, and the lip has first and second outer surfaces, which converge to an outer edge, which lies in a reference plane parallel to the central axis A.<br>
DE 36 01 238 C2 discloses a sealing device for roll bearings, in which the roll neck has a tapered section between the end face of the roll and the journal.  A flexible annular seal body, which has a radially extending annular sealing rib on the side of the ring that faces the end face of the roll, can be pushed onto this tapered section.  When the seal body is being pushed onto the tapered section of the roll neck, the radial pressure that acts to apply a bending moment stresses the annular sealing lip into a position inclined to the axial direction and resting on the outer surface of the tapered<br>
 <br>
section of the roll neck.  On its inner annular surface facing the outer surface of the tapered section of the roll neck, displaced parallel relative to the annular sealing lip, the seal body has circular shoulder projections, which apply a bending moment to the seal body under the axial pressure, and this bending moment counteracts the bending moment applied to the annular sealing lip.<br>
Roll neck seals that have two webs constructed with sealing lips and a reinforcing element that supports the seal body are disclosed by DE 37 21 265 Al, EP 1 430 962 Al, EP 1 442 804 Bl, EP 1 447 149 A2, WO 2005 / 037 455 Al, and US 4,099,731.<br>
The previously known sealing devices have been found to have the following disadvantages:<br>
•	The externally placed steel rim (= reinforcing element) must have clearance on both sides from the webs, which support the sealing lips.<br>
•	As a result of the tapered design of the roll neck, the sealing body must be variably stressed when it is pushed on and during the subsequent operation due to the unequal centrifugal forces produced by unequal arrangement of mass in the axial direction.<br>
 <br>
•	During placement on the roll neck, the rim slips on one side, so that the webs are inclined as a result.  Therefore, the seal does not exhibit reproducible behavior.<br>
•	The oil centrifugal lip on the oil-side sealing lip can bend over so far that contact occurs with the contact diameter of the oil-side sealing lip.<br>
•	The rim, which is held by point welding or butt welding, can tear open at the weld.  As a result, the thin steel band then acts as a knife and cuts the rubber seal during the rotation of the roll (total failure).<br>
•	Due to the trend in new rolling mills to regrind the backup rolls when wear develops in the chocks, regular inspection of the neck seals is possible only when the chocks are taken down from the roll necks.  However, it is just this which one wishes to avoid.  As a result, the neck seals must run reliably for longer periods of time.<br>
•	The rim slips in the prior art.  The neck sleeve presses on the rubber, the rubber swells out; the lip no longer fits well.<br>
•	Problem associated with the seal:  service life, aging due to thermal stress (frictional heat), becomes hard and cracked.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, the objective of the invention is to specify a roll neck seal that avoids the disadvantages cited above.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this objective is achieved by a neck sleeve for roll bearings, wherein the neck seal has:<br>
-- an annular seal body, which is nonrotatably connected with a roll neck with its bearing surface oriented coaxially with the roll axis and with at least two spaced webs that face away from the axis of the roll and that are in direct or indirect contact with an annular projection of the roll bearing, and<br>
-- a reinforcing element for reinforcing the seal body, and wherein the reinforcing element has a width that is greater than the outside separation of the two webs.<br>
The reinforcing element embedded in the seal body, whose axial extent is greater than the outside separation of the two webs, achieves the result that when the neck seal is being pulled on / pushed on and when it is being rotated during rolling on the roll neck, no tilting moment acts on  the webs. There is thus very extensive decoupling between the section of the neck seal that has the webs (facing away from the roll axis) and the section of the neck seal between the reinforcing element and the bearing surface (facing the roll axis).<br>
 <br>
In a further refinement of this design, it is proposed that the bearing surfaces in contact with the roll neck are each constructed symmetrically to the radial center planes of the webs, and the bearing surfaces, which are constructed independently of each another, are designed in such a way that the radial pressing of the annular seal body occurs in such a way that the prestressing of the webs and their continuation, the sealing lips, relative to the annular projection is equal. In particular, no undesired tilting moments are transferred to the webs and to the sealing lips associated with the annular projection.<br>
The bearing surfaces of the seal body that rest on the roll neck are slightly displaced.  However, the displaced material of the seal body is displaced along the reinforcing element at least partially into a cavity, so that no forces or moments act on the webs.  The gap thus serves as a forceless receiving space for the displaced material.  During this process, the material of the seal body that is to be displaced is located, as viewed in the radial direction, on the side that faces the roll neck, i.e., the side of the reinforcing element that lies opposite the webs.  The bearing surfaces that are in contact with the roll neck are each oriented symmetrically to the radial center plane of the webs.  As a<br>
 <br>
result of this type of design of the surfaces, the forces acting radially outward on the reinforcing element are equally great over the width of the reinforcing element.  The cavity is located between the two surfaces and is designed in such a way that no resistance opposes the material to be displaced. The cavity has the cross-sectional shape of a right triangle, one of whose legs is aligned parallel to the axis of the roll.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, it is proposed that with increasing axial distance from the roll, the reinforcing element 51 and/or the material of the seal body 50 present at a given time between the reinforcing element 51 and the bearing surface 53-1, 53-2 has increasing stiffness.  This achieves the result that the unequal radial centrifugal forces -- in different axial positions due to the unequal distribution in the axial direction of the mass of the seal body on the tapered roll neck -- are absorbed or compensated. This in turn has the advantageous result that no forces or moments or at least no unsymmetrical forces or moments are transferred to the webs, so that quantitatively equally great tensioning of the sealing lips of the webs relative to the annular projection is ensured.<br>
Further simplification is also realized if the reinforcing element consists of steel, steel fabric, synthetic<br>
 <br>
fabric, Kevlar fabric, aramid fiber or carbon fiber.  The use of fabrics or fibers makes it possible to simplify the production of a reinforcing element with variable stiffness, for example, by forming one  section of the reinforcing element with five plies and another section with eight plies.<br>
To reinforce the tips of the reinforcing element, it can be provided that the reinforcing element is formed with radial bends directed towards or away from the roll axis.  The cross section of the reinforcing element is S-shaped or U-shaped. The legs of the U-shaped reinforcing element point towards or away from the roll axis.<br>
Further embodiments of the device are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
A specific embodiment of the invention is described in greater detail below with reference to the highly schematic drawings.<br>
-- Figures la-lf show previously known sealing devices in cross section.<br>
-- Figure 2 shows a partially cutaway side view of a sealing device, which has a seal body and a reinforcing element that supports the seal body.<br>
-- Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional view of an embodiment<br>
 <br>
of the sealing device of the invention.<br>
Figures la to If show previously known neck seals 3, which have a seal body 50 with a reinforcing element 51.  The position of a roll axis 52 is indicated by the dot-dash line. The exact arrangement of the neck seal, roll, etc., can be seen in Figure 2.  The seal body 50 has a bearing surface 53 that points in the same direction as the roll axis 52 and at least two webs 54, 55 that point radially away from the roll axis 52.<br>
In Figure la, the seal body 50 is constructed with an embedded reinforcing element 51 in the form of a wire cable / helical spring and with a reinforcing element 51 in the form of a metal strip arranged between the webs 54, 55.  The bearing surface 53 extends from a left end 56 to a right end 57 and has a contour that fits the roll neck (not shown) in different places in the mounted state.  The left end 56 and the right end 57 likewise have different contours.  The drawing shows reinforcement of the right end 57 in the form of another reinforcing element.  In addition, a centrifugal lip 58, which deflects oil emerging from the gap between the neck sleeve and the bearing bush 6 (see Figure 2), is located to the right of the web 55.  Sealing lips are formed on the webs 54, 55.  In Figure lb, the sealing lips have different shapes.<br>
 <br>
The seal body 50 shown here does not have an embedded reinforcing element but rather only a reinforcing element 51 located between the webs 54, 55.<br>
Figure Ic shows a neck seal 3, in which, as in Figure 1, the webs 54, 55 are furnished with sealing lips that are mirror images of each other.<br>
Figure Id shows a design of a neck seal 3 according to Figure lb but with the reinforcing elements 51 from Figure la. Figure le shows a design according to Figure la but with a different design of the web 54.<br>
Figure If shows a design of a neck seal 3 in which the webs 54, 55 do not have sealing lips.<br>
Figure 2 shows a partially cutaway side view of a roll 1 with a roll neck 2.  A neck seal 3 is pushed onto the roll neck 2 by means of a neck sleeve 4, which is mounted nonrotatably on the roll neck 2.  The neck sleeve 4 holds the annular neck seal 3 in position.  The roll neck 2 with the neck sleeve 4 nonrotatably mounted on it is arranged in a bearing housing 5 with a bearing bush 6.  A gap 8, through which a lubricant is conveyed, is located between the rotating neck sleeve 4 and the stationary bearing bush 6.  A centrifugal lip 58 is formed on the neck seal 3 to deflect the oil in a certain direction.<br>
 <br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of the sealing device of the invention.  The reinforcing element 51 has a width 60 that is greater than the outside separation 59 of the webs 54, 55.  The sealing lip 56 of the seal body 50 is designed to be sufficiently elastic that it can be brought from its initial state (indicated by broken lines) to its mounted state without the application of a large amount of force.  The sealing lip 57 of the seal body 50 can have a design that is already well known, for example, as illustrated in Figures la to If.  The bearing surfaces 53-1 and 53-2 of the annular seal body 50 are separated from each other by a peripheral cavity 64 and can each be formed independently of each other.  In this regard, the contact pressures for the webs 54 and 55 above there with the appended sealing lips 65 are adjusted in such a way that the two sealing lips 65 each have the same initial stressing force towards the annular projection 7 located on the bearing (see Figure 2).  The bearing surfaces 53-1 and 53-2 are each arranged symmetrically to the respective center axis 61 or 62 of the webs 54 or 55.<br>
With increasing axial distance from the roll, the reinforcing element 51 and/or the material of the seal body 50 present at a given time between the reinforcing element 51 and the bearing surface 53-1, 53-2 has increasing stiffness.  This<br>
 <br>
can be achieved, e.g., by the use of materials with different moduli of elasticity.<br>
