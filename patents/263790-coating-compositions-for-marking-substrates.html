Coating Compositions for Marking Substrates<br>
The present invention refers to coating compositions for marking substrates, to a process for the preparation of these compositions, to substrates coated with these compositions and to a process for their preparation, to a process for preparing marked substrates using these compositions and marked substrate obtainable by the latter process and to amine salts of the organic metal compounds.<br>
Packaging usually needs to be marked with visible information such as logos, bar codes, expiry dates or batch numbers. One way to achieve this is by coating the packaging with a composition comprising a colour former and a colour developer, which upon treatment with energy such as heat reacts to form a visible colour.<br>
WO 02/074548 describes coating compositions comprising an oxyanion of a multivalent metal, for example ammonium octamolybdate (AOM), a binder, which is typically polymeric, and a solvent such as water or ethanol. These compositions were coated on a substrate, for example carton board, dried to yield an opaque coating and exposed to an IR laser to produce a black image.<br>
The disadvantage of the coating composition of WO 02/074548 is that only opaque coatings and black images can be obtained.<br>
WO 2004/043704 describes coating compositions comprising a colour former, an amine compound of molybdenum, tungsten or vanadium, an organic solvent and optionally a polymeric binder. An example of an "amine molybdate" is bis(2-ethylhexyl)amine octamolybdate. The compositions were coated on substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate film, aluminium foil or polypropylene packaging film, dried to yield an opaque or transparent coating and exposed to an IR laser or thermal printer to produce a coloured image.<br>
There is an ongoing need to develop further coating compositions.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide coating compositions, which yield coloured images of excellent intensity and of high durability especially in terms of water resistance and<br><br>
abrasion resistance, and which coating compositions can be modulated in order to achieve either transparent or opaque coatings.<br>
These objects are solved by the coating composition according to claim 1, the substrates according to claims 1 land 15, the processes according to claims 10,12 and 13, and by amine salts of organic metal compounds according to claim 16.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a colour former, an amine salt of an organic metal compound, a binder, a solvent, and optionally additional components, wherein the amine salt of the organic metal compound is of formula<br><br><br><br>
