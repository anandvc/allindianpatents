NON-AQUEOUS MICROELECTRONIC CLEANING<br>
COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING<br>
FRUCTOSE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to methods and non-aqueous cleaning compositions for cleaning microelectronic substrates, and particularly to such cleaning compositions useful with and having improved compatibility with microelectronic substrates characterized by copper metallization. The invention also relates to the use of such cleaning compositions for stripping photoresists, and cleaning residues from plasma process generated organic, organometailic and inorganic compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Many photoresist strippers and residue removers have been proposed for use in the microelectronics field as downstream or back end of the manufacturing-line cleaners. In the manufacturing process a thin film of photoresist is deposited on a wafer substrate, and then circuit design is imaged on the thin film. Following baking, the unpolymerized resist is removed with a photoresist developer. The resulting image is then transferred to the underlying material, which is generally a dielectric or metal, by way of reactive plasma etch gases or chemical etchant solutions. The etch gases or chemical etchant solutions selectively attack the photoresist-unprotected area of the substrate.<br>
[0003] Additionally, following the termination of the etching step, the resist mask must be removed from the protected area of the wafer so that the final finishing operation can take place. This can be accomplished in a plasma ashing step by the use of suitable plasma ashing gases or wet chemical strippers.<br><br>
Finding a suitable cleaning composition for removal of this resist mask material without adversely affecting, e.g., corroding, dissolving or dulling, the metal circuitry has also proven problematic.<br>
[0004] As microelectronic fabrication integration levels have increased and patterned microelectonic device dimensions have decreased towards the size of atoms, and the heat formed as current passes through the circuits have become a serious problem, it has become increasingly common in the art to employ copper metallizations as the conductor material, instead of aluminum, since copper is more beneficial in reducing the heat formation. These copper containing microelectronic materials have presented additional challenges to find acceptable cleaner compositions. Many process technology compositions that have been previously developed for "traditional" or "conventional" semiconductor devices containing Al/Si02 or AI (Cu)/Si02 structures cannot be employed with copper metallized structures. For example, hydroxylamine based stripper or residue remover compositions are successfully used for cleaning devices with Ai metallizations, but are practically unsuitable for those with copper metallizations. Similarly, many copper metallized are not suitable for Ai metallized devices unless significant adjustments in the compositions are made.<br>
[0005] Removal of these etch and/or ash residues following the plasma etch and/or ashing process for such copper and aluminum metalilized microelectronic structures has proved problematic, particularly for substrates metallized with copper. Failure to completely remove or neutralize these residues can result in the absorption of moisture and the formation of undesirable materials that can cause corrosion to the metal structures. The circuitry materials are corroded by the undesirable materials and produce discontinuances in the circuitry wiring and undesirable increases in electrical resistance.<br>
[0006]      Heretofore, photoresist strippers have often contained amines since they<br><br>
generally show superior cleaning performance in attacking hardened photoresist and in the ability to strip such hardened photoresist from the surface of the microelectronic substrates. However, copper is generally also severely attacked by amines and significant metal corrosion can occur if such a conventional photoresist stripper is utilized without modification. Therefore, it is highly desirable to provide a copper compatible photoresist stripper or cleaner for use in the microelectronics industry, particularly for copper metallized materials. It is also highly desirable to provide a copper compatible photoresist stripper or cleaner for use in the microelectronics industry, particularly for copper metallized materials, that is also compatible for use with aluminum metallized materials. Since the same shift in technology from aluminum to copper metallization is being seen in the development of flat panel displays, it is also desirable to provide a stripper/cleaner that can be use in producing such fiat panel displays.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Back end photoresist strippers and cleaning compositions of this invention are provided by non-aqueous compositions that are essentially non-corrosive toward copper as well as aluminum and that comprise a polar organic solvent, a hydroxylated amine, and as a corrosion inhibitor fructose. The compositions of this invention may also contain a number of other optional components. The cleaning compositions of this invention can be used over a wide range of process/operating conditions of pH and temperature, and can be used to effectively remove photoresists, post plasma etch/ash residues, sacrificial light absorbing materials and anti-reflective coatings (ARC). Additionally, it has been discovered that very difficult to clean samples, such as highly crosslinked or hardened photoresists and structures which contain titanium (such as titanium, titanium oxide and titanium nitride) or tantalums (such as tantalum, tantalum oxide and tantalum nitride) can be readily cleaned with the cleaning compositions of this invention.<br>
[0008]      The      non-aqueous,      essentially      no-corrosive      microelectronic<br><br>
stripper/cleaner compositions of this invention will generally comprise from about 70 % to about 95 % of the organic polar solvent, from about 1 % to about 15 % of the organic hydroxylated amine, and a corrosion-inhibiting amount of the fructose corrosion inhibitor, generally from about 0.1 % to about 15 % of the fructose. The wt percentages provided in this specification are based on the total weight of the cleaning composition.<br>

[0021 ] The anti-corrosion results obtained with the fructose containing cleaning compositions of this invention is by the following test results for a fructose containing compositions of this invention and the comparative test results for other saccharides.<br>
[0022] A piece of copper-coated silicon wafer (approximately 20 x 20mm) was prepared for the experiment. The piece was cleaned in a buffered oxide etch (which contains 35w/w% NH4F and 6w/w% HF for 1 minute, followed by rinsing in deionized water for 1 minute, and dried in nitrogen spray. Then the wafer piece was immersed in a 150mL beaker that has 100g of test solution in it, and the solution was heated at 60°C, stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm and, 60 minutes later, the piece was removed from the test solution, rinsed with deionized water for 1 minute, and dried with nitrogen spray. The thickness of copper layer (before and after the experiment) was determined by the ResMap (manufactured by Creative Design Engineering, Sunnyvale, CA) 4-point probe system.<br>
[0023] For the photoresist stripping experiment, the same test solutions were used at the same temperature (60 ° C) with the same stirring rate (200 rpm). A piece of glass having positive photoresist layer (ca. 1000 angstroms) was immersed in the test solution and the time required for all of the resist stripped away was measured.<br>
[0024] The test solutions (cleaning compositions) were the linvention Composition 6 of Table 2 and comparative compositions where the 5.00 parts of fructose of Composition 6 was replaced with 5.00 parts of sucrose (Comparative<br><br>
Composition A), 5.00 parts glucose (Comparative Composition B), and 5.00 parts galactose (Comparative Composition C). The results of these etch rate and photoresist stripping tests for the compositions were as set forth in Table 4.<br><br>
