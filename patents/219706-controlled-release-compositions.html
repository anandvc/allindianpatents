CONTROLLED-RELEASE COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to a solid dosage formulation in which an active<br>
ingredient is released over a sustained period.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]. . An important factor influencing the rate of absorption of an active agent administered as a tablet or other solid dosage formulation, and thus the efficacy and safely of the formulation, is the rate of dissolution of the dosage form in the body fluids of a human or animal.<br>
[0003]	The ability of components of the formulation to influence the rate of<br>
release of the active agent(s) thus constitutes the basis for the so-called controlled-release, extended-release, sustained-release or prolonged-action pharmaceutical preparations that are designed to produce slow, uniform release and absorption of the active agent over a period of hours, days, weeks, or months. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include a reduction in the required frequency of administration of the drug as compared to immediate-release dosage forms, often resulting in improved patient compliance; maintenance of a relatively stable concentration of the drug in the body leading to a sustained therapeutic effect over a set period of time; and decreased incidence and intensity of undesired side effects of the active agent resulting from a reduction of the high plasma concentrations that often occur after administration of immediate-release dosage forms.<br>
[0004]	Many materials have been proposed and developed as matrices for<br>
controlled release of active agents, i.e. drugs, pro-drugs, etc. These include polymeric materials such as polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene amides, ethyl cellulose, silicone and poly (hydroxymethyl methacrylate). See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,087,860 to Endicott et a/.; U.S. Patent No. 2,987,445 to Levesque et a/.; Salomon et a/., Pharm. Acta Helv., 55, 174-182 (1980); Korsmeyer, Diffusion Controlled Systems:   Hydrogels, Chap. 2, pp 15:37 in Polymers for Controlled Drug Delivery,<br><br>
Ed Tarcha, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Ra. USA (1991); and Buri et a/.f Pharm. Acta Helv. 55,189-197(1980).<br>
[0005]	High  amylose  starch  has  also been  used for controDed-release<br>
purposes, and, in particular, recent advances have been made using cross-linked high amylose starch. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,456,921 (Mateescu et a/.), which issued October 10, 1995, U.S. Patent No. 5,616,343 (Cartilier ef a/.),which issued April 1, 1997, U.S. Patent No. 6,284,273 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued September 4, 2001, U.S. Patent No. 6,419,957 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued July 16, 2002, and U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued August 19, 2003, describe solid controlled release oral pharmaceutical dosage units in the form of tablets comprising a dry powder of a pharmaceutical product and a dry powder of cross-linked high amylose starch in which the cross-linked high amylose starch includes a mixture of about 10-60% by weight of amylopectin and about 40-90% amylose.<br>
[0006]	Further examples of controlled-release materials include Kollidon™ SR<br>
marketed by BASF (Germany), this material being a physical mixture of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone), reportedly made up of about 80% PVA and 19% povidone, and approximately 0.8% sodium dodecylsulfate and about 0.2% silica as stabilizer. BASF Technical Information (July 2001) discloses that Kollidon™ SR can be used in the preparation of sustained release matrix dosage forms including tablets, pellets and granules, and that different technologies such as direct compression, roller compaction, wet granulation and extrusion may be employed in the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations. A number of patent publications provide further information on PVA-povidone mixtures: U.S. Patent Publication No. 2001/0038852 (Kotter et a/.) published November 8, 2001; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0012701 (Kotter et at.) published January 31, 2002, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0021846 (Kotter et ai.) published Januaiy 30,2003.<br>
[0007]	Extended and controlled release formulations relating to tramadol have<br>
been suggested, examples being described in: U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0143270, (Deboeck et a!.) published July 31, 2003; U.S. Patent No. 6,254,887 (Miller et at.) issued July 3, 2001; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2001/0036477 (Miller et ai) published November 1, 2001; U.S. Patent No. 6,326,027 (Miller et at.) issued<br><br>
December 4, 2001, WO 03/080031 (CILAG AG et a/.) published October 2, 2003. Articles have been published in which comparative data between "once-daily" tramadol formulations and immediate release tramadol formulations are presented: Adler et a/., "A Comparison of Once-Daily Tramadol with Normal Release Tramadol in the Treatment of Pain in Osteoarthritis," The Journal of Rheumatology (2002) 29(10): 2195-2199; and Bodalia et a/., "A Comparison of trie Pharmacokinetics, Clinical Efficacy, and Tolerability of Once-Daily Tramadol Tablets with Norma! Release Tramadol Capsules," Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003) 25(2): 142-149.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention relates to a solid dosage formulation that<br>
provides for controlled-release of a pharmacological agent. In one embodiment, the formulation includes a core having a pharmacological agent dispersed in a first controlled-release matrix comprising cross-linked high amylose starch, froni which matrix release of the agent is relatively slow. There is a coat formed over the core and the coat includes the agent dispersed in a second controlled-release matrix from which release of the agent is relatively fast<br>
[0010]	In the context of this invention, "relatively fast* means at least twice as<br>
fast when the initial rate of release of an agent is measured under the same conditions separately for each matrix material. To make such a measurement, one makes a formulation having the agent of the core and the agent of the coat differentially labeled from each other. In the case of tramadol, for example, the tramadol of the core could be labeled with 15N and the tramadol of the coat could be labeled with t3C. There are many ways known to a skilled person for differentially labeling such a compound so that its diffusion from the formulation can be traced without significantly affecting its rate of diffusion. A skilled person could estimate such relative rates to a reasonable approximation, provided the rates are sufficiently different from each other, from the biphasic behavior observed for release of the<br><br>
agent from a single formulation, e.g., from the rates at t=0, and t=12 hr of Figure 2. Typically, the measurement would be made under the conditions set forth in connection with Figure 2.<br>
[0011]	In  another  broad  embodiment, the invention  is a solid dosage<br>
formulation having a core with a pharmacological agent in a first controlled-release matrix. There is a coat formed over the core having the pharmacological agent in a second controlled-release matrix. The second controlled-release matrix is a physical mixture of polyvinyl acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone, and release of the agent from the matrix of the core is relatively slow with respect to release of the agent from the matrix of the coat Relatively slow means no more than half as fast when the initial rate of release of an agent is measured under the same conditions separately for each matrix material, the measurement being determined as described above in connection with the determination of relatively fast<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
CORE<br>
[00132] The core of a tablet of the invention includes at least one active ingredient and a matrix, these components associated in such away that release of the pharmaceutical ingredient from the matrix is controlled. In a specific embodiment, the matrix of the core is a cross-linked high amylose starch known under the name Contramid®, and described most recently in U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
6,607,748 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued August 19,2003. A preferred formulation in the context of this invention is provided in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748.<br>
[00133] Preferably, the core is formed by admixing the ingredients (in granular or powder form) and then compressing the mixture to form the core over which the coat is subsequently formed. The weight of the core can be any percentage of the weight of the total composition between 10% and 80%. The preferred percentage depends, upon other things, the total dosage of the pharmaceutical agent in a particular embodiment described further below, a tablet contains 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride and the core Is about 26% of the total weight of the tablet In another embodiment, a tablet contains 200 mg tramadol hydrochloride and the core makes up about 33% of the total weight of the tablet in yet another embodiment, a tablet contains 300 mg tramadol hydrochloride, and the core contributes 33% to the total weight of the tablet<br>
Active Agent in the Core<br>
[00134] An active pharmaceutical ingredient is present in the core of the composition of the present invention. A suitable pharmaceutical ingredient of the present invention is any such ingredient that is desired to be delivered in a sustained-release dosage form. A comprehensive list of suitable pharmaceutical agents can be found in The Merck Index. 12th Ed. Preferably, the pharmaceutical ingredient is, but not limited to, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, sodium salicylate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine sulfate, acetaminophen or diclofenac sodium, verapamil, glipizide, nifedipine, febdipine, betahistine, albuterol, acrivastine, omeprazole, misoprostol, tramadol®, oxybutynin, trimebutine, ciprofloxacin, and salts thereof, in addition, the pharmaceutical agent can be an antifungal agent, such as ketoconazole, or an analgesic agent such as acetylsalicyiic acid, acetaminophen, paracetamol, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, diflunisal, naproxen, ketorolac, diclofenac, tolmetin, sulindac, phenacetin, piroxicam, mefamanic acid, dextromethorphan, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including salicylates, pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof or mixtures thereof. Pro-drugs are part of the invention.<br><br>
[00135] The solubility of the pharmaceutical agent in aqueous solution can be a wide variety of values. The aqueous solubility of the pharmaceutical agent can be less than 10* g/L, more than 10'3 g/L, more than 10~2 g/L, more than 10"* g/L, more than 1 g/L, more than 10 g/L, more than 100 gfL, more than 500 g/L, more than 1000 g/L, or more than 2000 g/L Preferably, the solubility is more than 100 g/L More preferably, the solubility is more than 500 g/L Most preferably, the solubility is more than 1000 g/L<br>
[00136] The pharmaceutical agent can meet a variety of dosage requirement For example, the dosage requirement of the pharmaceutical agent can be less than 1 mg/dosage unit, more than 1 mg/dosage unit, more than 10 mg/dosage unit, more than 100 mg/dosage unit, more than 200 mg/dosage unit, more than 300 mg/dosage unit, more than 400 mg/dosage unit, more than 500 mg/dosage unit, or more than 1000mgfaosage unit.

[00137] Particular embodiments include a core containing tramadol hydrochloride in which the core contains between about 10% and 90% of the total tramadol present in the tablet, e.g. about 45 mg of a 100 mg strength tablet (45% of the tablet total), or about 90 of a 200 mg strength tablet (45% of the tablet total), or about 151 mg of a 300 mg strength tablet (50% of the tablet total).<br>
Matrix of the Core<br>
[00138] The release from the formulation of an active pharmaceutical ingredient located in the core is slower than the release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient located in the matrix of the coat. A preferred matrix of the core is cross-linked high amyiose starch, known under the name Contramid® and described in U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748. In particular embodiments, the matrix makes up between about 10% and about 90% by weight of the core i.e., the ratio of the matrix of the core to the active ingredient of the core (w/w) is between about 0.1 and about 10, or between about 0.2 and about 9, or between about 02 and about 8, or between about 0.3 and about 7, or between about 0.4 and about 6, or between about 0.5 and about 5, or between about<br><br><br><br>
[00145] The active agent is present at levels ranging from about 1 to about 90 wL% of the total weight of the core, preferably from about 10 to about 70 wt% of the total composition of the core, more preferably from about 20 to about 60 wt% of the total composition of the core, and probably most often between about 30 to about 50 wL% of the total composition of the core.<br>
[00146] Of course, the total amount of all components is 100 wL%a and those of ordinary skill in the art can vary the amounts within the stated ranges to achieve useful compositions.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the coat is formed by dry compression. The weight of the coat can be any percentage of the weight of the total composition between about 10% and about 90%, but is preferably in the higher part of this range. The coat thus usually makes up between about 20% to about 90%, (w/w) of a tablet of the invention, or about 25% to about 90%. or about 30% to about 85%, or about 35 % to about 85%, or about 40% to about 85%, or about 45% to about 85%, or about 45% to about 90%, or about 50% to about 90% or about 50% to about 85 %, or about 55% to about 90%, or about 55% to about 85%, or about 55% to about 80%, or about 60% to about 90%, or about 60% to about 85%, or about 60% to about 80%, or about 60% to about 75%, or about 65% to about 90%, or about 65% to about 85%, or about 65% to about 80%, or about 65% to about 75%, or about 65% or about 70% or about 75%.<br>

Example I<br>
A.	Cross-Linking<br>
[00176] High amylose starch (30.0 kg) containing about 70% w/w of amyiose (CI AmyloGel 03003) is placed in a reactor. To this reactor is added water (55.0 1) containing sodium hydroxide (30.0 g) and sodium sulfate (2.40 kg). The resulting slurry is heated to a temperature of 30°C. Phosphorus oxychloride (22.5 g) is added : to the reaction mixture which is reacted for one hour.<br>
B.	Chemical Modification, Hydroxyproylation<br>
[00177]	The  crude  reaction  mixture  from   Part A  is transferred  into  a<br>
hydroxypropylation reactor. The reaction mixture is heated to 40CC. over 30 minutes and the reaction is purged with nitrogen. After a full purge, propylene oxide (1-80 kg) is added. The reaction mixture is kept at 40°C. for 20 hours. The reaction mixture is neutralized with 0.1N H2S04 (1:2 v/v) to a pH of 5.5. The starch slurry is washed with a basket-centrifuge at a speed of 1200 rpm. The obtained starch cake is re-slurrified in 35 I of water and centrifuged a second time. The resulting starch cake is dried in a flash dryer at an inlet temperature of 160°C. and an outlet temperature of 60°C.<br>
C.	Gelatinization<br>
[00178] The modified granular starch cake is diluted in demineralized water in order to form a slurry at a concentration of about 8% calculated on dry substance. The resulting slurry has a relative density of 1.032 kg/I compared to water. The pH of tiie modified starch slurry is adjusted to 6.0. The slurry is then heated to 160°C. by direct steam injection (Schlick Model 825). The temperature variation is not higher than ±1°C. The slurry is held in a holding column for a period of 4 minutes at a temperature of 160°C. and a pressure of about 5.5 bar.   The pressure is then<br><br>
reduced to atmospheric by passing through a flash. The slurry is then contained at 95°C. in a hold tank.<br>
D. Spray-Drying<br>
[00179] The drying of the slurry from Part C is carried out using a Niro FSD 4 spray-drying tower equipped with a 0.8 mm nozzle and fed at 10 l/hour. The inlet temperature is fixed at 300°C. and the outlet temperature of 120°C. The obtained powder is a controlled release excipient with the following properties:<br><br>
