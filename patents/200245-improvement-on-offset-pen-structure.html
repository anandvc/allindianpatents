				<td>IMPROVEMENT ON OFFSET PEN STRUCTURE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to an offset pen, and more particularly to an improved offset pen structure for comfortable holding, enhanced functions, and easy making.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
So far, conventional writing tools such as fountain pen, pencil, ball point pen, coloring pencil and writing brush on the market are all linear in shape. That is, a writing head and a holding stick of a writing tool are substantially coaxial. Owing to the limit of people's palm structure, the writing tool generally tilts rearward the wrist while being used so that the vision line of the user will be obstructed by the writing tip of the writing tool. As such, there are several defects in writing or drawing with the conventional writing tool. First of all, a user cannot clearly see the space behind the writing tool along the vision line, so it is difficult for the user to write straight or draw in position. Especially for kids, they are likely to change their sitting posture, e.g. lie their heads upon the desks, while writing in an attempt to bypass the blockage of the vision line by the writing tool, and it is harmful to kids' eyesight and bone. In addition, people are used to holding the writing tool slantwise, so the linear shape of the writing tool results in the slant of the writing portion relative to the working surface, and as such, the user gets no right point to exercise the pressing point and has to exert more stress on the working surface while writing or drawing. The inevitable fatigue would ruin children's interests in writing. Furthermore, the slant of the<br>
1<br><br>
writing portion relative to the working surface makes the drawing operations with an assistant tool such as a ruler unable to achieve the best effect, since the writing tip will not be in close contact with the side surface of the ruler.<br>
The present inventor found that the above problems can be solved by providing an offset pen which includes an intermediate portion between a holding portion, i.e. the pen stick, and a writing portion, i.e. the writing head, to make the holding portion and the writing portion positioned in different axes. For example, Figs. 1A and 1B schematically show how is an offset pen used to solve the above problems.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 1A, an offset pen includes a holding portion A, an intermediate portion B and a writing portion C. Owing to the presence of the crooked intermediate portion B, the axis of the writing portion C and that of the holding portion A will intersect at a certain angle so as to adjust the angle between the writing portion C and the working surface to approximately 90 degree. As such, the vision line of the user will not be obstructed by the writing tool as by the front portion PI of a conventional pen. Accordingly, the writing operation of the user will proceed relatively smoothly. Furthermore, the crooked intermediate portion B provides a structure suitable for user's fingers to exert force on so as to lessen the load of user's fingers.<br>
Please refer now to Fig. 1B in which an offset pen is used together with a ruler R. By using an offset pen including a holding portion A, an intermediate portion B and a writing portion C as mentioned above, the writing portion C is approximately perpendicular to the working surface K so as to be in close contact with the side surface R2 of the ruler R. As<br>
2<br><br>
such, the user will be able to draw a line precisely as desired without being influenced by his palm structure and the thickness of the ruler.<br>
So far, several kinds of offset or shaped pens have been developed in spite they are provided for solving problems other than the above ones.<br>
US Patent No. 655,73 Lissued to Pierce in 1900 discloses an offset fountain pen, in which a laterally extended short tube has one end thereof connected to the handle and the other end thereof connected to the writing head to buffer the ink discharged from the reservoir in the handle to the writing head to avoid blots and soiling of the fingers. The Pierce's design is focused on the selection of the cross-sectional areas of the ink passages of the pen in order to achieve the above purposes, and there is no special design for improving the holding feeling and stability and other details while using the offset pen.<br>
US Patent No. 5,527,124 issued to Kolaric in 1996 discloses a shaped pen, and more particularly a ball-point pen, which is shaped in the lower section of the pen housing in order to position the writing tip at a steeper than usual angle to the surface of the paper to maximize the free flow of ink onto paper while still allowing the user to maintain a comfortable grip upon the pen. However, the Kolaric's design is focused on the selection of the lengths and the angles of sections of the pen in order to achieve the above purposes, and there is no special design for improving the holding feeling and stability and other details while using the shaped pen. On the other hand, according to the holding manner of the shaped pen suggested in the Kolaric's patent, as shown in Fig. 3, the vision line of the user, although not obstructed by the writing tool, is blocked by the user's fingers.<br>
3<br><br>
US Patent No. 849,513 issued to Sturm in 1907 discloses an offset pen which includes a gripping section G in the intermediate portion and writing head area, as shown in Fig. 4. The gripping section also obstructs the user's vision line while writing or drawing.<br>
On the other hand, there is no reference so far disclosing the manufacturing of the offset pen. In fact, it is difficult to manufacture the housing of an offset pen integrally like injection molding the conventional linear pen because a crooked passage extending through the writing portion, the intermediate portion and the holding portion may be required for accommodating an ink reservoir or refill.<br>
Furthermore, there is no offset pen designed for replaceable pencil which is a kind of pencil consisted of a plurality of replaceable pencil heads of a short rod shape. The hollow passages of the above-mentioned conventional offset pens for accommodating ink reservoirs are all crooked so as not to be suitable for storing a series of replaceable pencil heads.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an objective of the present invention is to provide an offset pen having a vacancy beneath the intermediate portion so that the user's vision line can be extended to both sides of the writing head through the vacancy while writing or drawing.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an offset pen which includes a pen cap which has a specially designed cap clip to allow the nonlinear offset pen to be secured onto a holding piece, e.g. a pocket of a shirt, uprightly.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide an offset<br>
4<br><br>
pen in which the intermediate portion is designed to make the holding and writing operations of the offset pen smooth and comfortable.<br>
A yet objective of the present invention is to provide an offset pen which includes an illuminating device on the intermediate portion so that the offset pen can be used in a relatively dark environment.<br>
Still an objective of the present invention is to provide an offset pen which can be easily made by combining pieces separately manufactured.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an offset pen which is especially suitable for using replaceable writing tips, e.g. replaceable pencil heads.<br>
Basically, an offset pen according to the present invention includes a holding portion to be supported by a user's writing hand; a writing portion to be mounted thereon a writing tip to leave marks on a working surface; and an intermediate portion substantially connected between one end of the holding portion and one end of the writing portion to make the holding portion and the writing portion positioned in different axes, and create a vacancy between the writing portion and the holding portion.<br>
In addition, according to the first aspect of the present invention, the intermediate portion of the offset pen has two concavities on two sides thereof, respectively, optionally provided for two fingers of the user's writing hand to rest thereon so as to facilitate the holding and writing operations. For example, while writing, the holding portion is supported between the thumb and the index finger of the user's writing hand, and tips of the thumb and the index finger of the user's writing hand rest on the two concavities. Preferably, the intermediate portion has an upper, surface optionally provided for the tip of the index finger of the user's<br>
5<br><br>
writing hand to press against to further facilitate the holding and writing operations while writing. As for the shape of the upper surface, it can be plane, concave or convex, as long as it is comfortable for the pressing finger.<br>
In order to accommodate the writing tip, e.g. the tip of a ball point pen, and a writing material supply corresponding to the writing tip, e.g. an ink refill, a hollow passage extending through the writing portion, the intermediate portion and the holding portion is arranged within the offset pen. In this case, it is preferred that a lower part of the intermediate portion is larger than an upper part thereof in cross-sectional area so that the hollow passage penetrates through the intermediate portion smoothly.<br>
Preferably, the intermediate portion includes a soft pad at the lower part, and the middle finger of the user's writing hand optionally sustains against the soft pad while writing to feel comfortable.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, the offset pen further includes an illuminating device in addition to the essential writing portion, holding portion and intermediate portion mentioned above. The illuminating device is mounted to the intermediate portion to lighten an area near the writing tip.<br>

The pen cap includes a hollow tube for receiving the writing portion therein to avoid blotting of the writing tip when the offset pen is not in use; and a clip strip attached onto the hollow tube, and having an angle with the hollow tube to become axially parallel to the holding portion when the hollow tube caps the writing portion so as to cooperate with the holding portion to allow the offset pen to clamp a holding piece.<br>
Preferably, the hollow tube can cap an end part of the holding<br>
7<br><br>
portion when the offset pen is in use, and the clip strip is pivotally attached onto the hollow tube. By this way, the clip strip can be pivotally rotated to have the angle with the hollow tube to become axially parallel to the holding portion when the hollow tube caps the writing portion, and pivotally rotated to become axially parallel to the hollow tube when the hollow tube caps the end part of the holding portion.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, the offset pen having the essential writing portion, holding portion and intermediate portion mentioned above is characterized in that the intermediate portion is formed by combining at least two,separate,pieces.<br>
In an embodiment, the offset pen is formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece forms a part of the writing portion, the intermediate portion and the holding portion, and a second piece forms the other part of the writing portion, the intermediate portion and the holding portion. The first and the second pieces can be combined by tooth engagement.<br>
Alternatively, the offset pen is formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece forms a part of the intermediate portion and the holding portion, and a second piece forms the writing portion, and the other part of the intermediate portion and the, holding portion. The first and the second pieces can be combined by pivotally connecting the first piece to the second piece.<br>
In another embodiment, the offset pen is formed by combining three separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece forms a part of the intermediate portion, a second piece forms the writing portion and the other part of the intermediate portion, and a third piece forms a<br>
8<br><br>
holding portion, and screwing the combined intermediate portion and writing portion to the holding portion. Preferably, the first, piece forms a side or rear surface of the intermediate portion. When the first piece forms a rear surface of the intermediate portion, the first piece is preferably a soft pad allowing the middle finger of the user's writing hand to sustain thereagainst while writing to feel comfortable.<br>
In a further embodiment, the offset pen is formed by combining several separately integrally formed^pieeest wherein a first piece forms a part of the intermediate portion, a second piece forms another part of the intermediate portion, and a third piece forms the writing portion and the other part of the intermediate portion, and screwing the combined intermediate portion and writing portion .to the holding portion. Preferably, the first and the second pieces form two opposite side surfaces of the intermediate portion, respectively.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the offset pen is formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece forms the holding portion and a part of the intermediate portion, and a second piece forms the other part of the intermediate portion and the writing portion. The first piece and the second piece are combined by tooth engagement.<br>
Alternatively, the offset pen is formed by combining three separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece forms a part of the intermediate portion, a second piece forms the other part of the intermediate portion and the writing portion, and a three piece forms the holding portion. The combined writing portion and the intermediate portion is connected to the holding portion by screwing. Preferably, the first piece and the second piece are combined by tooth engagement.<br>
9<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the offset pen is formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece forms the holding portion and the intermediate portion, and a second piece forms the writing portion. Preferably, the first piece and the second piece are combined by tooth engagement.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the essential writing portion, holding portion and intermediate portion mentioned above, the offset pen further includes a writing tip retracting mean for selectively retracting the writing tip into the writing portion. The writing tip retracting mean includes a button mounted in the top end of the holding portion and having a hollow tube for receiving the top end of an ink refill so as to allow the ink refill to be selectively pushed down with respect to the holding portion in response to the operation of a user. In addition, there is a spring installed around the ink refill and having a first end urging against a fixing element of the ink refill and a second end urging against an inner surface of the offset pen so as to form an elastic force to the ink refill in response to the movement of the ink refill. Preferably, the second end of the spring is a resilient rod urging against a low part of the intermediate portion.<br>
Accordingly, the writing tip of the ink refill is extended out of the writing portion when the button is depressed, and the writing tip of the ink refill is drawn into the writing portion when the button is released. Preferably, the offset pen further includes, a clip strip attached to the holding portion thereof to allow the offset pen to clamp a holding piece.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the essential writing portion, holding portion and intermediate portion mentioned above, the offset pen is further arranged therein a linear<br>
10<br><br>
hollow passage having both ends thereof open into the air, and axially extending through the holding portion and the intermediate portion for accommodating therein a series of replaceable writing tips.<br>
In an embodiment, each of the writing tip and the replaceable writing tips is of a pencil-type writing material of a short rod shape, and includes a tapered writing part and a cylindrical base part.<br>
In another embodiment, each of the writing tip and the replaceable writing tips is of a short rod shape, and includes a head part of a pencil-type writing material; a middle part having a first well securing thereto the head part; and a tail part connected to the middle part and having a second well for allowing the head part of another writing tip to be received therein.<br>
Preferably, a stopper structure is arranged at the opening of the second wall for stopping the middle part of the another writing tip when the head part of the another writing tip is inserted to be received in the second well. By this way, it can prevent the tip of the head part from sustaining against the bottom of the middle part of a last writing tip so as to prevent from the damage of the head part.<br>
Generally, the series of replaceable writing tips aligns itself by head-to-tail connection. The head part and the tail part can be oriented to the intermediate portion and the holding portion, respectively, in the hollow passage. Alternatively, the head part and the tail part can be oriented to the holding portion and the intermediate portion, respectively, in the hollow passage. In this case, it is feasible to have one head part of the series of replaceable writing tips in the hollow passage protrude from the holding portion for providing an alternate writing tip to leave marks on the working surface.<br>
11<br><br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, the offset pen having the essential writing portion, holding portion and intermediate portion mentioned above is characterized in that the writing tip is connected to an ink-soaking refill by a connector.<br>
In an embodiment, the ink-soaking refill is arranged within a hollow passage of the holding portion for storing and supplying ink. The connector is arranged within the intermediate portion and substantially connected between one end of the ink-soaking refill and one end of the writing tip so as to allow the writing tip to obtain the ink from the ink-soaking refill. Certainly, in another embodiment, the connector can be integrally formed to the writing tip or integrally formed to the ink-soaking refill.<br>
Accordingly, the ink-soaking refill is made of liquid-adsorptj.ve material, and the connector is made of a liquid-adsorptive material, too. Alternatively, the connector is an introducing tube made of a metal material for introducing the ink from the ink-soaking refill to the writing tip. Preferably, the writing tip is a ibrush-type Writing tip. In addition; the offset pen further includes an upper cap detachably engaging with an opening of the holding portion.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of preferred embodiments of this invention are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only; it is not intended" to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.<br>
Please refer to Fig 5 which shows a basic structure of an offset pen<br>
17<br><br>
according to the present invention. The offset pen includes a holding portion 51, an intermediate portion 52 and a writing portion 53. The intermediate portion 52 is connected between one end 511 of the holding portion 51 and one end 531 of the writing portion 53 to make the holding portion 51 and the writing portion 53 positioned in different axes, and create a vacancy 54 between the writing portion 53 and the holding portion 51. While writing, the holding portion 51 can be supported by a user's writing hand between the thumb and the index finger, and tips of the thumb and the index finger (see Fig. 1A or IB) can rest on two sides of the intermediate portion 52, respectively, according to the writing habit of general users. A writing tip 532 is mounted to the writing portion 53 to leave marks on a working surface 55, for example to write or draw on a piece of paper. It is clear that the provision of the vacancy 54 beneath the intermediate portion 52 between the writing portion 53 and the holding portion 51 allows the user's vision line to be extended to both sides of the writing tip 532.<br>
It should be noted that the term "pen" indicated herein can be any kind of writing tool such as a fountain pen, ball point pen, pencil, brush, coloring pen, electronic sensing pen, etc., as long as a suitable writing tip is mounted to the writing portion of the offset pen.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF OFFSET PENS HAVING CONCAVITIES ON INTERMEDIATEJPORTION<br>
In order to make the holding and writing operations smooth and comfortable, two sides of the interrnediate portion is made to have two, concavities 61 and 62 complying with the curvatures of the tips of the thumb and the index fingers, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6 which is a<br>
18<br><br>
schematic top plane view of the offset pen of Fig. 5.<br>
In addition to the two concavities 61 and 62, it is preferred that an upper surface 71 of the intermediate portion 52 is comfortable for the index finger of the user's writing hand to press thereagainst to facilitate the holding and writing operations. Owing to the provision of such an upper surface, the user can optionally hold the offset pen in a manner as shown in Fig. 1A or IB, or in a manner as shown in Fig. 7A. It is to be noted that in Fig. 7A, the arrow indicates the pressing force of the index finger on the upper surface. As for the shape of the upper surface, it can be plane (Fig. 7B), concave (Fig. 7C) or convex (Fig. 7D), as long as it is comfortable for the pressing finger.<br>
Preferably, but not necessarily, a hollow passage 81 is arranged within the offset pen and extends through the writing portion 53, the intermediate portion 52 and the holding portion 51, as shown in Fig. 8, for accommodating therein a writing material supply 533 corresponding to the writing tip 532. For example, if the offset pen is a brush, no passage is required. On the other hand, if the offset pen is a ball point pen, an elongated ink refill is generally connected to the writing tip 532 for supplying ink. Therefore, the passage 81 is needed for accommodating the ink refill 533. In order to make the ink supply relatively smooth, the passage 81 preferably penetrates the crooked intermediate portion 52 through a relatively short path. On the other hand, in order to allow the ink refill to penetrate through the crooked intermediate portion smoothly, it is preferred to make a lower part 521 of the intermediate portion 52 larger than an upper part 522 thereof in cross-sectional area.<br>
19<br><br>
EMBODIMENTS  OF  OFFSET  PENS  HAVING  ILLUMINATING DEVICE<br>
In order to allow an offset pen to be used in a relatively dark environment, an illuminating device can be provided on the intermediate portion to lighten an area near the writing tip.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 9 which is a first preferred embodiment of an offset pen including an illuminating device according to the present invention. As shown, the illuminating device 911 is mounted on a lower part 521 of the intermediate portion 52 and located within the vacancy 54 between the writing portion 53 and the holding portion 51. The presence of the vacancy 54 not only allows the user's vision line to be extended to both sides of the writing tip while writing or drawing, but also allows the light emitted from the illuminating device 911 to reach the area 92 near the writing tip 532. Furthermore, if the writing tip 532 is substantially located in an extension line 512 of the holding portion 51, the light emitted from the illuminating device 911 can be centered on the writing tip 532 so as to enhance the lightening effect.<br>
The illuminating device 911 is a light bulb which is a point light source having a size and a lightening way suitable for a pen, and a battery set 912 is installed in the holding portion 51 for providing power for the light bulb 911 via a wire 913. In order to save electric power of the battery set 912, a switch 914 mounted on an end part of the holding portion 51 is provided in this embodiment for controlling the provision of the power from the batten/ set 912 to the light bulb 911, The switch 914 is an exposed rotatable disk, and the user can control the switching-on and switching-off of the light bulb 911 by turning the disk.<br>
Please refer to Figs. 10 and 11 which are a second and a third<br>
20<br><br>
preferred embodiments of offset pens including illuminating devices according to the present invention, respectively. As shown, for each of the offset pens, the intermediate portion 52 and the writing portion 53 are transparent so that the light bulb 911 can be mounted at any position inside the intermediate portion 52, e.g. at the lower part 521 (Fig. 10) or at a position 523 near the connection between the intermediate portion and the writing portion (Fig. 11).<br>
If the intermediate portion is not transparent, the illuminating device can still be mounted inside the intermediate portion at a lower part near a connection position between the intermediate portion and the holding portion. In this case, however, an opening 111 should be arranged at the lower part 521 beneath the light bulb 911 to allow light to be transmitted out of the intermediate portion 52 to reach the area 92 near the writing tip 532, as shown in Fig. 12. It is apparent that the farther the light bulb 911 is installed away from the opening 111, the smaller the illuminating area 92 becomes. Therefore the position of the writing tip 532 should be arranged to be properly located within the illuminating area 92. In other words, the writing tip 532 is preferably located in an extension line 512 of the holding portion 51 so that light emitted from the light bulb 911 can reach the writing tip 532.<br>
In another embodiment, the illuminating device 911 is mounted on a front surface 524 of the intermediate portion 52, as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
In a further embodiment, the intermediate portion 52 includes a detachable soft pad 525 at the lower part, as shown in Fig. 14A, which makes the middle finger of the user's writing hand optionally sustaining thereagainst feel comfortable while writing. The illuminating device 911 is attached on the soft pad 525, as shown in Fig. 14B.<br><br>
EMBODIMENTS OF OFFSET PENS HAVING PEN CAP<br>
In order to avoid blotting and be convenient to be carried, a pen cap is provided for the offset pen having the basic structure of Fig. 5.<br>
Please refer to Figs. 15A and 15B which are side views of a first preferred embodiment of an offset pen having the basic structure of Pig. 5 and including a pen cap according to the present invention, in which the pen cap is capped on the writing portion and the holding portion, respectively. The pen cap 15 includes a hollow tube 151 and a clip strip 152 attached onto the hollow tube 151, and there is a special angle ??between the hollow tube 151 and the clip strip 152. When the offset pen is not in use, the writing portion 53 is received in the hollow tube 151 to avoid blotting of the writing tip 532. Meanwhile, the clip strip 152 will become axially parallel to the holding portion 51 when the hollow tube 151 caps the writing portion 53 so as to cooperate with the holding portion 51 to allow the offset pen to clamp a holding piece such as pocket cloth, a piece of paper or a plastic pen-holding sleeve of a notebook. When the offset pen is in use, the hollow tube 151 can be taken off from the writing portion 53 and cap on an end part 513 of the holding portion 51.<br>
If it is not desired to have the angle a between the hollow tube and the clip strip when the hollow tube caps on the end part of the holding portion, as shown in Fig. 15B, the clip strip can be,made to be pivotally attached onto the hollow tube to solve this problem. Please refer to Figs. 16A and 16B, the clip strip 162 can be pivotally rotated to have the angle a with the hollow tube 161 to become axially parallel to the holding portion 51 when the hollow tube caps the writing portion 53,<br><br>
and pivotally rotated to become axially parallel to the hollow tube 161 and the holding portion 51 when the hollow tube 161 caps the end part 513 of the holding portion 51.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF ASSEMBLY-TYPE OFFSET PENS<br>
In order to make the manufacturing of an offset pen easily, the intermediate portion of an offset pen having a crooked passage can be formed by combining at least two separate pieces according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 17, the offset pen is formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces 171 and 172, wherein a first piece 171 forms a part of the writing portion 53, the intermediate portion 52 and the holding portion 51, and a second piece 172 forms the other part of the writing portion 53, the intermediate portion 52 and the holding portion 51.

In addition to the above embodiments in which the first piece includes a part of the holding portion and a part of the intermediate portion, the first piece can also be a part of the intermediate portion only, such as a rear surface or a side surface.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 21 now. The offset pen is formed by combining a first piece 211 as a rear surface with a second piece 212 including the writing portion 53 and the other part of the intermediate portion 52, and then screwing the combined writing portion 53 and intermediate portion 52 to the holding portion 51. In this embodiment, the first piece 211 is a soft pad. The offset pen combined by several pieces has the advantage of easy making, and in addition, the provision of the soft pad 211 as the rear surface of the intermediate portion allows the middle finger of the user's writing hand to sustain thereagainst while writing to feel comfortable.<br>
On the other hand, Fig. 22 schematically shows a first piece 221 serving as a side piece to be combined with a second piece 222 including the writing portion 53 and the other part of the intermediate portion 52. Alternatively, the first piece can be a piece 231 serving as a rear and two side surfaces of the intermediate portion, as shown in Fig.<br>
23.<br>
In a further embodiment shown in Fig. 24, the offset pen is formed by combining several separately integrally formed pieces 241, 242 and<br>
24<br><br>
243, wherein the pieces 241 and 242 form two opposite side surfaces of the intermediate portion 52, respectively, and the piece 243 forms the writing portion 53 and the other part of the intermediate portion 52. The combined writing portion and intermediate portion are then screwed to the holding portion to form the offset pen.<br>
Please refer to Fig. 25A. In a still further embodiment shown in Fig. 25A, the offset pen is also formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece 271 forms the holding portion 51 and a part of the intermediate portion 52, and a second piece 272 forms the writing portion 53 and the other part of the intermediate portion 52. The first piece 271 and the second piece 272 can be combined by tooth engagement, as shown in Fig. 25B.<br>
Alternatively, in another embodiment shown in Fig. 25C, the offset pen is also formed by combining two separately integrally formed pieces. The first piece 273 forms the holding portion 51 and the intermediate portion 52, and the second piece 274 forms the writing portion 53. The first piece 273 and the second piece 274 can be combined by tooth engagement.<br>
In a further embodiment shown in Fig. 26A, the offset pen is formed by combining several separately integrally formed pieces, wherein a first piece 261 forms a part of the intermediate portion 52, a second piece 262 forms the other part of the intermediate portion 52 and the writing portion 53, and a third piece forms the holding portion 51 (not shown). The first piece 261 and the second piece 262 can be combined by tooth engagement, as shown in Fig. 26B. In addition, the combined intermediate portion and writing portion can be connected to the holding portion by screwing.<br>
25<br><br>
Alternatively, the connecting interface between the first piece 261 and the second piece 262 can be modified to various forms as shown by the dotted line x-x, y-y or 2-2 in Fig 26C. By the way, an ink refill 275 can be installed into the assemble-type offset pen easily, as shown in Fig 27 A and 27B. Certainly, an ink refill 276 with a large upper portion also can be installed into the assemble-type offset pen easily as shown in Fig. 28A and 28B.<br>
In order to produce a retractable offset pen, a writing tip retracting mean is provided.   Please refer to Fig 29A.   The offset pen has a basic structure the same as that of Fig. 25A.   In this embodiment, the offset pen utilizes a writing tip retracting mean for selectively retracting the writing tip into the writing portion.    The writing tip retracting mean includes a button 279 engaging with an opening of the holding portion 51* and having a hollow tubejor.receiving'the top part of the ink refill 277 so as to allow the ink refill 277 to be selectively pushed down with respect to the holding portion 51 in response to the operation of a user. In addition, there is a spring 278 installed around the ink refill 277 between a fixing element 2771 of the ink refill 277 and an inner surface of the offset pen.   The spring 278 has a first end urging against the fixing element 2771 of the ink refill 277 and a second end urging against an inner surface of the offset pen so as to form an elastic force to the ink refill 277 in response to the movement of the ink refill 277.    Preferably, the second end of the spring 277 is a resilient rod urging against the low part of the intermediate portion 52    Accordingly, when the button 279 is depressed, the writing tip 532 is extended out of the writing portion 53, as shown in Fig. 29C.   When the button 279 is released, the writing tip 532 is drawn into the writing portion 53, as shown in Fig. 29B.    By<br>
26<br><br>
the way, the retractable offset pen can be assembled easily and quickly.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF OFFSET PENS HAVING INTERNAL SPACE FOR STORING REPLACEABLE WRITING TIPS<br>
In order to make an offset pen suitable for using replaceable writing tips, a linear hollow passage is arranged to accommodate the replaceable writing tips according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 30, the offset pen includes a linear hollow passage 25 having both ends 251 and 25_2 thereof open into the air, and axially extending through the holding portion 51 and the intermediate portion 52 for accommodating therein a series of replaceable writing tips 534.<br>
As shown, each of the writing tip 532 and the replaceable writing tips '534 is of a pencil-type writing material of a short rod shape, and includes a tapered writing part 535 and a cylindrical base part 536. When the writing tip 532 becomes blunt after being used for a period of time, it can be taken out of the writing portion 53 and inserted into the holding portion 51 from the end 252 of the passage 25. Owing to the push force resulting from the insertion of the, used writing tip, all the replaceable writing tips 534 will move toward the other end 251 of the passage 25, and one of these writing tips 534 will be pushed out of the end 251. Afterwards, the dropped writing tip is inserted into the writing portion 53 as a substitutive writing tip 532.<br>
It should be noted that the term "pencil" or "pencil-type writing material" used herein indicates any kind of writing or drawing tool or material which will become shorten and blunted owing to rubbing with a working surface to leave a portion of the material as marks on the working surface. For example, it can be 2H or 2B black pencil, color<br>
27<br><br>
pencil or crayon.<br>
Refer to Fig. 31 which schematically shows another preferred embodiment of an offset pen of a replaceable pencil type. The offset pen also includes a linear hollow passage 25 having both ends 251 and 252 thereof open into the air, and axially extending through the holding portion 51 and the intermediate portion 52 for accommodating therein a series of replaceable writing tips 534. Likewise, each of the writing tip 532 and the replaceable writing tips 534 is of a short rod shape.<br>
Further referring to Fig. 32, each of the writing tips 532 and 5,34 includes a head part 537 of a pencil-type writing material, a middle part 538 having a first well 5381 securing thereto the head part 537, and a tail part 539 connected to the middle part 538 and having a second well 5391 for allowing the head part 537 of another writing tip 534 to be received therein. When the head part of a next writing tip is inserted to be received in the second well, a stopper structure 5392 arranged at the opening of the second wall 5391 stops the middle part 538 of the next writing tip to prevent the tip of the head part 537 from sustaining against the bottom of the middle part 538 so as to prevent from the damage of the head part 537. By this way, the series of replaceable writing tips aligns itself by head-to-tail connection.<br>
As shown in Fig. 31, all the head parts 537 are oriented to the end 251, and all the tail portion 539 are oriented to the holding portion 252, respectively, in the hollow passage 25. Therefore, when the writing tip 532 becomes blunt after being used for a period of time, it can be taken out of the writing portion 55 and inserted into the holding portion 51 from the end 252 of the passage 25. Owing to the push force resulting from the insertion of the used writing tip, all the replaceable writing tips<br>
28<br><br>
534 will move toward the other end 251 of the passage 25, and one of these writing tips 534 will be pushed out of the end 251. Afterwards, the dropped writing tip is inserted into the writing portion 53 as a substitutive writing tip 532.<br>
Alternatively, the head part 537 and the tail part 539 can also be oriented to the ends 252 and 251, respectively, of the hollow passage 25, as shown in Fig. 33. In this case, it is feasible to have one head part 540 of the series of replaceable writing tips in the hollow passage protrude from the holding portion 51 for providing an alternate writing tip to write or draw. When the writing tip 532 or 540 becomes blunt after being used for a period of time, it can be taken out of the writing portion 53 or the holding portion 51, and inserted into the intermediate portion 52 from the end 251 of the passage 25. Owing to the push force resulting from the insertion of the used writing tip, all the replaceable writing tips 534 will move toward the other end 252 of the passage 25, and one of these writing tips 534 will be pushed out of the end 252 to be inserted into the writing portion 53 as a substitutive writing tip 532, or to substitute for the writing tip 540.<br>
By the way, a pencil-type offset pen has an additional advantage of writing or drawing in different thickness. By rotating the offset pen to orient the axis of the writing tip to a specific direction, the angle between the writing tip and the working surface may change so that the area of the writing tip in contact with the working surface may also be different. Accordingly, the marks left on the working surface vary in thickness with the rotation of the offset pen.<br>
EMBODIMENTS  OF  OFFSET PENS  HAVING AN  ASSEMBLE-<br>
29<br><br>
TYPE INK REFILL<br>
Please refer to Fig. 34A and 34B.    The offset pen has a basic structure the same as that of Fig. 25A.    An assemble-type ink refill is installed into the offset pen.   The assemble-type ink refill includes an ink-soaking refill 341 arranged within the hollow passage of the holding portion 51 for storing and supplying ink, and a connector 342 arranged within the hollow passage of the intermediate portion and connected between one end of the ink-soaking refill 341 and one end of the writing tip   343.      The ink-soaking refill 341 is made of "liquid-adsorptive material" such as sponge, cotton, wool, and silk, etc. By the way, the writing tool can be modified to an offset pen having an ink-soaking refill, such as one of various" marks or ink-loading pen.<br>
Alternatively, the connector 342 can-be modified to various forms which is well known to one skilled in the art, as shown in Fig. 34C, 34D, 34E, and 34F.    Preferably, the connector 342 is made of a liquid-adsorptive   material.      More   preferably,  the   connector   342   is an introducing tube made of a metal material for introducing the ink from the ink-soaking refill 341  to the writing tip 343.    In addition, the writing tip 343 can be a brush-type writing tip, as shown in Fig. 34D. In order to make the brush-type writing tip 343 finer, the brush-type writing tip 343 can be surrounded with an outer shell, as shown in Fig. 34E.    Certainly, in another embodiment,,the writing tip 343 is made of a liquid-adsorptive material, as shown in Fig. 34F.<br>
The combining manner between the writing tip 343 and the connector 342 can be modified to various forms, as shown in Fig. 34C, 34D, 34E3 and 34F. Certainly, in another embodiment, the connector 342 can be integrally formed to the writing tip 343 (as shown in Fig.<br>
30<br><br>
34E) or integrally formed to the ink-soaking refill 341. In addition, the offset pen may be modified to have an upper cap detachably engaging with an opening of the holding portion so that the ink can be refilled easily.<br>
To sum up, the present invention uses a nonlinear design for the holding portion and the writing portion of a writing tool to adjust the angle between the writing portion and a working surface to approximately 90 degrees. In addition, the crooking of the front portion of the offset pen eliminates the obstruction of the user's vision line. Furthermore, the line-drawing operation can be more precise compared to the conventional one. Moreover, the side surfaces with concavities and the upper surface of the intermediate portion provide a place for resting the fingers to facilitate the holding and writing operations. The provision of an illuminating device allows the offset pen to be used in a relatively dark environment,, The provision of the specific pen cap allows the offset pen to be carried conveniently. By combining at least two pieces separately manufactured, the offset pen having crooked passage therein can be made easily. By providing a linear hollow passage having both ends thereof open into the air and axially extending through the holding portion and the intermediate portion, a series of replaceable writing tips can be accommodated therein as supplying material. Many designs have also been made to the present invention to enhance its attractions.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention need not be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various<br><br>
