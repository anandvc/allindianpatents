Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for storing<br>
digitized data of content which is a copyrighted work such as a movie,<br>
on a large-capacity medium such as a digital optical disc, and enabling<br>
only specific terminals to completely acquire the data. In particular,<br>
the present invention relates to a technique for playing content<br>
data that is recorded on a large-capacity medium and has been encrypted<br>
and modified in order to protect copyright.<br>
Background Art	<br>
 With increases in capacity of storage media in recent<br>
years, systems that distribute contents, which are copyrighted works<br>
such as movies, that have been digitized and stored on media such<br>
as digital optical discs are becoming prevalent. In such a system,<br>
it is necessary toprotect the copyright of a content such that playback, copying and the like of the content is carried out onlyunder limitations<br>
defined by an agreement with the copyright holder. A general system<br>
for protecting copyrighted works from dishonest copying and the like,<br>
in other words copying and the like without the permission of the<br>
copyright holder, has a structure whereby digital content is encrypted<br>
with a content key managed by the copyright holder, recorded on a<br>
disc, and is only able to be decrypted by a terminal that has a<br>
corresponding content key. A party wishing to obtain the content<br>
key must obey stipulations relating to copyright protection agreed<br>
on with the copyright holder.<br><br>
As one example of such a system, Patent Document 1<br>
discloses a method for protecting a content key that is for encrypting<br>
and decrypting content data, by generating the content key based<br>
on a seed key and time-variable data.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 2000-100069<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
Although the content key must be managed strictly so<br>
that it is not exposed to an outside party in this case, it is possible<br>
that the content key will be exposed dishonestly due to some kind<br>
of accident or occurrence. Once the content key is exposed, there<br>
is a danger that a content key for future content will be exposed<br>
using the same method. It is therefore assumed that dishonest usage<br>
of future content will not be able to be prevented. The prior art<br>
is vulnerable to this kind of attack because the content data is<br>
protected only by content keys that are protected by a prescribed<br>
method.<br>
In view of the described problem, the present invention<br>
has an object of providing a data playback method and a data processing<br>
apparatus according to which, if a method is discovered to break<br>
content protection due to some kind of accident or occurrence, other<br>
content will not be able to be used dishonestly using the same method.<br>

is a data playback method for reading protected digital data from<br>
a recording medium and playing the read protected digital data, the<br><br>
recording medium having recorded thereon (i) the protected digital<br>
data which has been generated by modifying and encrypting original<br>
digital data, and (ii) modified restoration-use information which<br>
has been generated by modifying restoration-use information that<br>
is for use in restoring modified digital data, the data playback<br>
method including: a first step of reading the protected digital data<br>
from the recording medium, and subjecting the read protected digital<br>
data to decryption which corresponds to the encryption, to generate<br>
modified digital data; a second step of subjecting the generated<br>
modified digital data to restoration which corresponds to the<br>

in the fourth step may be executed before the playing of the restored<br>
digital data, and the first step, the second step, and the third<br>
step may be executed in parallel during the playing of the restored<br>
digital data.<br>
Here, the modification of the restoration-use information may<br>
be modification that makes the restoration-use information<br>
software-tamper-resistant.<br>

encrypting the original digital data and then modifying the encrypted<br>
digital data, in the first step, instead of the decryption, the read<br>
protected digital data may be subjected to restoration that<br>
corresponds to the modification, with use of the restoration-use<br>
information, to generate encrypted digital data, and in the second<br>
step, instead of the restoration, the encrypted digital data may<br>
 be subjected to decryption that corresponds to the encryption, to<br>
generate the restored digital data.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is a data playback<br>
method for reading protected digital data from a recording medium<br>
and playing the read protected digital data, the recording medium<br>
having recorded thereon (i) the protected digital data which has<br>
been generated by modifying and encrypting original digital data,<br>
and (ii) modified restoration-use information whichhas been generated<br>
by modifying restoration-use information that is for use in restoring<br>
modified digital data, the data playback method including: a first<br>
step of reading the protected digital data from the recording medium,<br>
and subjecting the read protected digital data to decryption which<br>
corresponds to the encryption, to generate modified digital data;<br>
a second step of subjecting the generated modified digital data to<br>
restoration which corresponds to the modification, with use of the<br>
restoration-use information, to generate restored digital data; a<br>
third step of playing the generated restored digital data; and a<br>
fourth step of, before the first step, reading the modified<br>
restoration-use information from the recording medium, and subjecting<br>
the read modified restoration-use information to restoration that<br><br>
corresponds to the modification, to generate unmodified<br>
restoration-use information.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is a data processing<br>
apparatus that reads protected digital data from a recording medium<br>
and plays the read protected digital data, the recording medium having<br>
recorded thereon (i) the protected digital data which has been<br>

restoration-use information in a format used in processing by the<br>
restoration unit; and a control unit operable to control such that<br>
the generation of the restoration-use information by the generation<br>
unit is executed before the decryption by the decryption unit.<br>
Here, the control unit may control such that the generation<br>
of the restoration-use information is executed before playback of<br>
the restored digital data, and such that the decryption by the<br><br>
decryption unit, the restoration by the restoration unit and the<br>
playback by the playback unit are performed in parallel during playback<br>
of the restored digital data.<br>
Here, the modification of the restoration-use information may<br>
be modification that makes the. restoration-use information<br>
software-tamper-resistant.<br>
Here, the digital data may be composed of a plurality<br>
of pieces of content, and execution processing of the restoration-use<br>
information may differ for each piece of content.<br>
Here, the protected digital data may have been generated by<br>
encrypting the original digital data and then modifying the encrypted<br>
digital data, in the decryption unit, instead of the decryption,<br>

Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the described invention, content is dually<br>
protected according to an operation or the like and encryption. The<br>
significance of this is as follows.<br>
If a unified method is employed to encrypt each content, and<br>
the restoration processing or the like using restoration-use<br>
information or the like is different for each content, even if the<br>
encryption of a content is broken dishonestly, other content will<br>
be protected according to transformation that uses the restoration<br>
information or the like. This provides even stronger protection of<br>
copyright of content or the like.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention,<br>
transformation of the restoration-use information is executed before<br>
decryption. The significance of this is as follows.<br>
The present invention is effective in cases such as when the<br><br>

content data in an embodiment of the present invention;<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The following describes a best mode for carrying out the<br>
invention, with reference to the drawings.<br>
The recording medium used in the present invention has recorded<br>
thereon content data that is protected according to encryption with<br>
a content key and data modification by an operation that is different<br>
to the encryption. Also recorded on the recording medium with the<br>
content data is the content key and a program for executing an inverse<br>
operation to the aforementioned operation, which are also in a<br>
protected state. The content key is protected by revocation<br>
i n formation that enabl es the content key to be used only by an author i zed<br>
data processing apparatus that has permission to use the content<br>
data, and is recorded together with the revocation information. The<br>
program is protected by being subjected to TRS (being subjected to<br>
processing to make data software-tamper-resistant).<br>
The procedure used to record the content data includes<br>
a step of encrypting the content data with the content key, and a<br><br>
step of data modification according to an operation that is different<br>
to the encryption. The procedure also includes a step of recording<br>
the content key in a protected state to the recording medium, and<br>
a step of recording a program for executing an inverse operation<br>
to the aforementioned operation to the recording medium. Here, the<br>
program is in a protected state that is achieved using a different<br>
method of protection to the method used to protect the content key.<br>
The procedure further includes a step of protecting the content key<br>
according to revocation information that enables the content key<br>
to be used only by an authorized data processing apparatus that has<br>
permission to use the content data. The procedure further includes<br>
a step of protecting the program by subjecting it to TRS.<br>
Pig. 1 shows the structure of a recording medium and a<br>
content playback apparatus of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A recording medium 101 has recorded thereon playback control<br>
information 111, TRS (Tamper-resistant Software) bytecodes .112,<br>
protected content data 113, an encrypted content key 114, and<br>
revocation information 115. The recording medium 101 is assumed to<br>
be a BD (Blu-Ray Disc) for instance, but is not limited to being<br>
so. Note that in the present Description, "TRS bytecodes" denotes<br>
codes generated by subjecting bytecodes to processing for making<br>
data software-tamper-resistant.<br>
In the present embodiment, it is assumed that one content<br>
is composed of a plurality of pieces of MPEG2-TS (Motion Picture<br>
Expert Group 2- Transport Stream) data. It is the playback control<br>
information 111 that defines the playback order of the pieces of<br>
data for playing the content.<br>
The TRS bytecodes 112 (one example of modified restoration-use<br><br>
information) are one or more bytecodes (one example of restoration- use<br>
information) that has been subject to processing to put software<br>
into a state in which secret information, processing contents and<br>
the like included in the software cannot be ascertained by an act<br>
of analysis. Specific execution contents of the bytecodes are<br>
described later. Note that although an example of bytecodes is given<br>
in the present embodiment, an execution program other than bytecodes<br>
may be used.<br>
The protected content data 113 (one example of protected<br>
digital data) is data generated by subjecting plaintext MPEG2-TS<br>
(one example of digital data) that can be output as video by a decoder<br>
to encryption processing using the content key, and modification<br>
processing in which an XOR operation or the like with a particular<br>
value is performed.<br>
The encrypted content key 114 is data generated by encrypting,<br>
with a media key, the content key for decrypting the content data.<br>
■ The following describes the revocation information 115.<br>
A key management organization has a collection of a plurality of<br>
device keys and a plurality of media keys. The key management<br>
organization allocates one of the device keys, and a key identification<br>
number for the device key, to each of content playback apparatuses<br>
102, and gives the respective allocated device key and key<br>
identification number to each content playback apparatus 102. The<br>
key management organization also allocates one media key to the<br>
recording medium 101. Next, the key management organization encrypts<br>
the media key respectively using the each of the device keys allocated<br>
to the content playback apparatuses 102, to generate encrypted media<br>
keys, and generates a list of the encrypted media keys and key<br><br>
identification numbers that correspond to all the device keys . This<br>
list is the revocation information 115. A drawback of this simple<br>
method is that the size of the data of the revocation information<br>
115 will be unrealistically large if there is a large number of content<br>
playback apparatuses 102. Therefore, the method disclosed in<br>
"Digital Content Hogo-you Kagi Kanri Houshiki (Key Management Method<br>
for Protecting Digital Content)" (Nakano, Ohmori and Tatebayashi,<br>
Symposium on Cryptography arid Information Security 2001, SCIS2001,<br>
5A-5, Jan. 2001) may be used to compress the size of the data of<br>
the revocation information 115. A method to be used is not limited<br>
to this method, and any other method for compressing the size of<br>
the data of the revocation information 115 may be used.<br>
The content playback apparatus 102 is composed of a disc<br>
reading unit 121, a playback control unit 122, a user operation<br>
reception unit 123, a TRS bytecode execution unit 124, a decryption<br>
unit 125, a content data restoration processing unit 126, a decoder<br>
127, a content key generation unit 128, a revocation information<br>
processing unit 129, and a device key storage unit 130. One<br>
implementation example of these components is the disc reading unit<br>
121 being a BD drive, and the other components being realized by<br>
a computer composed of a CPU, a work memory, an HDD and the like.<br>
'■':" Here, the description of the structure of the recording<br>
medium 101 and the content playback apparatus 102 pertaining to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is completed.<br>
Description of Content Playback Processing<br>
The following describes content playback processing, with use<br>
of Fig. 2.<br>
The content playback processing starts upon the user operation<br><br>
reception unit 123 receiving a content playback start request from<br>
the user via the user operation reception unit 123.<br>
Upon the content playback start request being received,<br>
the revocation information processing unit 129 performs revocation<br>
checking processing with respect to the content playback apparatus<br>
102 (S201) . Details of the revocation checking processing are given<br>
later.<br>
Subsequently, the processing branches depending on whether<br>
or not generation of the media key is successful in the revocation<br>
checking processing at S201 (S202).<br>
If generation of the media key succeeds in the revocation<br>
checking processing at S201, the playback control unit 122 performs<br>
selection of the protected content data 113 (step S203).<br>
; If generation of the media key fails in the revocation<br>
checking processing at S201, notification is issued that the content<br>
playback apparatus 102 is revoked, and the processing ends (S208) .<br>
After the processing at S203 ends, the TRS bytecbdes 112<br>
necessary for playback of the selected protected content data 113<br>
are read, and the TRS bytecode execution unit 124 performs TRS bytecode<br>
execution processing (S204) . Details of the TRS bytecode execution<br>
processing are given later. Note that the processing up to this point<br>
is pre-processing that is performed before the content is displayed.<br>
In accordance with the playback control information 111,<br>
the playback control unit 122 instructs reading of the protected<br>
content data 113. The content key generation unit 128 and the<br>
decryption unit 125 perform decryption of the read protected content<br>
data 113. (S205) . Hereinafter, the data obtained as a result of<br>
decrypting the protected content data 113 is called modified content<br><br>
data (one example of modified digital data). The encryption used<br>
in the encryption of the protected content is AES (Advanced Encryption<br>
Standard), but is not limited to being so. Since decryption processing<br>
is performed repeatedly during content playback until the end of<br>
the protected content data 113, restoration (S206) and decoding of<br>
content (S207), which are described later, are executed in parallel.<br>
Details of decryption processing of the protected content data 113<br>
are given later.<br>
The content data restoration processing unit 126 performs<br>
restoration processing on the modified content data output by the<br>
decryption unit 125 (S206) . The restoration processing is executed<br>
in units of aligned units, each of which is composed of a predetermined<br>
number of MPEG2-TS packets in MPEG2-TS data, or executed in units<br>
of sectors, each of which is the unit of recording on the recording<br>
medium 101. During content playback, decryption processing of the<br>
protected content data 113 (S205) and decoding of content which is<br>
described later (S207) are executed in parallel. Details of<br>
restoration processing of the modified content data are given later.<br>
The restored content data is decoded in the decoder 127,<br>
and is output to a device that displays video, such as a television<br>
monitor (S207) . During content playback, decryption of the protected<br>
content data 113 (S205) and restoration of the modified content data<br>
(S206) are executed in parallel.<br>
The content playback processing ends when playback of all the<br>
content data ends.<br>
Here, the description of the content playback processing<br>
is completed.<br>
Revocation Checking Processing of the Content Playback<br><br>
Apparatus 102<br>
The following describes revocation checking processing of the<br>
content playback apparatus 102.<br>
The revocation checking processing is processing that starts<br>
after the start of content playback in Fig. 2, and is for checking<br>
that the content playback apparatus 102 is not revoked, according<br>
to the revocation information 115 recorded on the recording medium<br>
101. The revocation checking processing corresponds to step S201.<br>
The revocation information processing unit 129 reads the<br>
device key obtained from the device key storage unit 130 (S301).<br>
The device key is information that can be used to specify the content<br>
playback apparatus 102, and is unique to the content playback apparatus<br>
102.<br>
Next, the revocation information processing unit 129 reads<br>
the revocation information 115 recorded on the recording medium 101<br>
(S302), and generates the media key with use of the read device key<br>
and the revocation information 115 (S303).<br>
The media key cannot be generated if the content playback<br>
apparatus 102 is revoked. Details about generating the media key<br>
with use of the device key and the revocation information 115 can<br>
be found in National Technical Report Vol. 43, No. 3, pp. 118-122<br>
(Engineering Administration Center, Matsushita Electric Industrial<br>
Company, June 18, 1997) .<br>
Here, the description of the revocation checking processing<br>
of the content playback apparatus 102 is completed.<br>
TRS bytecode execution processing<br>
The following describes TRS bytecode execution processing<br>
(corresponding to step S204 of Fig. 2), with use of Fig. 4.<br><br>
The TRS bytecode execution unit 124 obtains the TRS bytecodes<br>
112 necessary for playback of the instructed content, from the<br>
recording medium 101 (S401).<br>
 The TRS bytecode execution unit 124 executes the obtained<br>
TRS bytecodes 112, thereby outputting restoration-use bytecodes<br>
(S402) . The restoration-use bytecodes are bytecodes executed in the<br>
content data restoration processing unit 126.<br>
The following describes a specific example of restoration<br>
processing of modified content data in the content restoration<br>
processing unit 126 at S206, with use of Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, an<br>
explanation is given about processing of bytecodes for restoring<br>
the content data by performing an XOR operation of the modified content<br>
data and a certain value by executing the restoration-use bytecodes .<br>
701 expresses a bit sequence that is the unit of modification of<br>
the modified content data. A parameter 702 shows a parameter for<br>
performing an XOR operation for restoring the modified content data.<br>
The parameter 702 is specified in the restoration-use bytecodes.<br>
The content restoration processing unit 126 outputs, as plaintext<br>
content data 703, the result of performing the XOR operation on the<br>
unit of modification 701 of modified content data and the parameter<br>
702 by executing the restoration-use bytecodes . The entire modified<br>
content data is restored by repeatedly executing the described<br>
processing.<br>
. The execution processing is assumed to be an XOR operation<br>
using the modified content data with a specific byte sequence in<br>
the bytecodes, with a value in a specific address of the data to<br>
be restored, or with a combination of those values. However, the<br>
execution processing is not limited to being an operation mentioned<br><br>
above. The execution processing may alternatively be a combination<br>
of several operations that incur a relatively small processing load,<br>
such as a ROT. The processing executed according to restoration-use<br>
bytecodes may differ for each content.<br>
' .- Furthermore, the TRS bytecodes 112 may be data generated<br>
by concatenating encryption key-use TRS bytecodes 501 and encrypted<br>
restoration-use bytecodes 502 (one example of modified<br>
restoration-use information), as shown in Fig. 5. In such a case,<br>
the encryption key-use TRS bytecodes 501 are executed by the TRS<br>
bytecode execution unit 124, to output an encryption key for the<br>
encrypted restoration-use bytecodes 502. The output encryption key<br>
and encrypted restoration-use bytecodes 502 are transmitted to the<br>
decryption unit 125, which generates restoration-use bytecodes . The<br>
generated restoration-use bytecodes are transmitted to the content<br>
restoration unit 126, and the processing continues.<br>
Furthermore, in the above example, the restoration-use<br>
bytecodes that are output are different bytecodes to the TRS bytecodes<br>
112 recorded on the recording medium 101. However, the<br>
restoration-use bytecodes that are output may be bytecodes generated<br>
in TRS bytecode execution processing at S204 in which the TRS bytecodes<br>
112 self-rewrite part of their own codes. The following describes<br>
the TRS bytecode execution processing at S204 for generating<br>
restoration-use bytecodes 803 by self-rewriting, with use of Fig.<br>
8. In Fig. 8, pre-execution codes 801 of the TRS bytecodes 112 are<br>
executed according to the TRS bytecode execution processing at S204,<br>
thereby self-rewriting into post-execution codes 802 to output<br>
restoration-use bytecodes 803. Here, when executing the<br>
restoration-use bytecodes 803 in the content restoration processing<br><br>
unit 126, the post-execution codes 802 generated according to the<br>
rewriting in the TRS bytecode execution processing at S204 will not<br>
be rewritten again. And, during content playback, the decryption<br>
of the protected content data 113 at step S205 in Fig. 2 and the<br>
restoration of the modified content data at S206 in Fig. 2 can be<br>
executed in parallel without distortion occurring in the displayed<br>
video.<br>
Decryption Processing' of Protected Content Data 113<br>
The following describes decryption processing of protected<br>
content data 113 (corresponding to S205 of Fig. 2), with use of Fig.<br>
6.<br>
The content key generation unit 128 obtains the encrypted<br>
content key 114 from the recording medium 101 via the disc reading<br>
unit 121 (S601).<br>
■ '' \ Next, the content key generation unit 128 obtains, from<br>
the revocation information processing unit 129, the media key that<br>
was generated in the revocation checking processing of the content<br>
playback apparatus 102 at S201 in Fig. 2, and decrypts the encrypted<br>
content key 114 (S602).<br>
The decryption unit 125 obtains the protected content data<br>
113 from the recording medium 101 via the disc reading unit 121 (S603) .<br>
The decryption unit 125 obtains the content key from the<br>
content key generation unit 128, and decrypts the protected content<br>
data 113 (S604) . The modified content data output as a result of<br>
the decryption is transmitted to the content restoration processing<br>
unit 126.<br>
Here, the description of the decryption processing of the<br>
protected content data 113 is completed.<br><br>
Note that although in the present embodiment the protected<br>
content data 113 is generated by subjecting plaintext content data<br>
to modification processing and then encryption, the plaintext content<br>
data may instead be encrypted and then subject to modification<br>
' processing. In this case, the order of S205 and S206 in Fig. 2 is<br>
switched.<br>
Furthermore, although in the present embodiment the<br>
restoration-use bytecodes are output in the TRS bytecode execution<br>
processing at S204 in Fig. 2, a fixed-length byte value (one example<br>
of restoration-use information) may be output as the output of the<br>
TRS bytecode execution processing at S204. In this case, the<br>
restoration processing of the modified content data at S206 uses<br>
the value output as a result of the TRS bytecode execution processing<br>
atS204, in a fixed operation processing, for example an XOR operation<br>
on the modified content data and the output value of S204.<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment, although<br>
operation processing such as an XOR operation is performed on the<br>
modified content data in the restoration of modified content at S206<br>
in Fig. 2, the content may be protected by changing the reading order<br>
and playback order of the MPEG2-TS files that compose the content.<br>
The following describes this processing with use of Fig. 9. The<br>
playback control information 111 expresses that the content is<br>
composed of four TS files a to d, and, as a reading order 901 in<br>
the decryption unit 125, that these TS files are read in the following<br>
order: TS data b, TS data a, TS data d, TS data c. In Fig. 2, the<br>
protected content data 113 corresponding to each of the TS data files<br>
is read in accordance with the playback control information 111,<br>
and the decryption of the protected content data 113 at S205 is performed.<br><br>
data correspond respectively to the predetermined number of sets<br>
of TRS bytecodes, and correspond respectively to the predetermined<br>
number of encrypted content keys.<br>
(2) The protected content data 113 is generated in a manner<br>
such as the following by a content distribution apparatus.<br>
' At least part of one piece of MPEG2-TS data is subjected<br>
to an XOR operation with a certain value, and the part is replaced<br>
with the obtained operation result. Then, using the content key,<br>
an encryption algorithm that implements AES, for instance, is applied,<br>
thereby generating the protected content data 113.<br>
(3) The revocation information 115 includes a plurality of<br>
encrypted media keys. The encrypted media keys correspond<br>
respectively to a plurality of devices, and have attached thereto<br>
a device identifier of the corresponding device, for instance. Here,<br>
the devices are, for instance, content playback apparatuses.<br>
A key management server apparatus possessed by the key<br>
management organization encrypts the media key using each of the<br>
device keys allocated to devices that are not revoked, thereby<br>
generating encrypted media keys. Each of the device keys allocated<br>
to a revoked device is used to encrypt predetermined detection<br>
information, thereby generating encrypted media keys. Here, the<br>
predetermined detection information has a fixed value, for example<br>
the value XN0".	«**•<br>
The revocation information processing unit 129 selects<br>
an encrypted media key that corresponds to the content playback<br>
apparatus 102, and decrypts the selected encrypted media key using<br>
the device key obtained from the device key storage unit 130, to<br>
obtain decrypted information. Here, if the decrypted information<br><br>
is "0", the content playback apparatus 102 is considered to be revoked,<br>
and generation of the media key is considered to have failed. If<br>
the obtained decrypted information is not w0", the content playback<br>
apparatus 102 is not revoked and the generation of the media key<br>
succeeds, and therefore the decrypted information is considered to<br>
be the media key.<br>
(4) The TRS bytecode execution processing may be an ROT,<br>
which is a rotation operation. One example of a rotation operation<br>
is as follows.<br>
J-	For instance, ROT2(X) shows subjecting 32-bit data X to a 2-bit<br>
circular shift to the left. Subjecting 32-bit data X to a 2-bit<br>
circular shift to the left denotes separating the data X into its<br>
highest 2 bits XI and its lowest 30 bits X2, and shifting X2 to the<br>
highest 30 bits of the data X and shifting XI to the lowest 2 bits<br>
1: of the data X.<br>
C-,i'; (5) The TRS bytecodes 112 shown in Pig. 8 include, for<br>
instance, (i) encrypted data that is a predetermined plain text that<br>
has been encrypted, (ii) a decryption-use computer program for<br>
decrypting the encrypted data, and (iii) a rewriting-use computer<br>
2C program for the TRS bytecodes 112 to self-rewrite the pre-execution<br>
codes 801 using the plaintext obtained according to the decryption.<br>
When the TRS bytecodes 112 are executed, the encrypted data<br>
included in the TRS bytecodes 112 are decrypted by the decryption-use<br>
computer program, thereby generating a plaintext. Then the<br>
. .&gt; rewri ting-use computer program rewrites the pre-execution codes 801<br>
that are part of the TRS bytecodes 112, with the generated plaintext.<br>
The restoration-use bytecodes 803 that include the post-execution<br>
codes 802 which are the overwritten part is generated in this way.<br><br>
(6) When the switching of the TS data shown in Fig. 9<br>
is performed, the restoration-use bytecodes include, for instance,<br>
two instructions such as the following.<br>
SWAP TS data b, TS data a (instruction 1)<br>
SWAP TS data d, TS data c (instruction 2)<br>
Here, the instruction *SWAP A, B" shows switching of the playback<br>
order of WA" and XXB" that are TS data. When the instruction *SWAP<br>
A, B" is executed, the playback order is switched such that the TS<br>
data UB" is played first, and then the TS data VXA" is played.<br>
When the aforementioned instruction 1 and instruction<br>
2 are executed, as described above, the playback order of the TS<br>
data is as follows: TS data a, TS data b, TS data c, TS data d.<br>
