BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the rate matching of a channel<br>
encoded signal, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for controlling a<br>
demultiplexer (DEMUX) and a multiplexer (MUX) used for rate matching.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, radio communication systems, such as satellite, ISDN<br>
(Integrated Services Digital Network), W-CDMA (Wide band-Code Division<br>
Multiple Access), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System), and<br>
IMT (International Mobile Telecommunication)-2000 systems, channel-encode<br>
source user data with an error correction code prior to transmission, in order to<br>
increase system reliability. Typical codes used for channel encoding are<br>
convolutional codes and linear blocks code for which a single decoder is used.<br>
Lately, turbo codes, which are useful for data transmission and reception, have<br>
been suggested.<br>
A multiple-access and multiple-channel communication system matches<br>
the number of channel encoded symbols to a given number of transmission data<br>
symbols to increase data transmission efficiency and system performance. This<br>
operation is -called rate matching. Puncturing and repetition are widely<br>
performed to match the data rate of channel encoded symbols. Rate matching<br>
has recently emerged as a significant factor in UMTS for increasing data<br>
transmission efficiency in the air interface and for improving system performance.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an uplink transmitting device in a general<br>
mobile communication system (a UMTS system, herein).<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a channel encoder 110 receives frame data at<br>
predetermined TTIs (Transmission Time Intervals)which may be 10, 20, 40, or<br>
80ms, and encodes the received frame data. And the channel encoder 110<br>
outputs encoded symbols according to a predetermined coding rate R. The frame<br>
data size(number of information bits) is determined by a (data rate of the frame<br>
data) * (TTI). If we don't consider tail bits, the number of encoded symbols are<br>
determined by the (frame data size) * (coding rate R). A 1st interleaver 120<br>
interleaves the output of the channel encoder 110. A radio frame segmenter 130<br>
segments interleaved symbols received from the 1st interleaver 120 into 10-ms<br>
radio frame blocks of which size is determined by (the number of encoded<br>
symbols)/(10), wherein 10 is the radio frame length unit. A rate matcher 140<br>
matches the data rate of a radio frame received from the radio frame segmenter<br>
130 to a preset data rate by puncturing or repeating symbols of the radio frame.<br>
The above-described components can be provided for each service.<br>
A MUX 150 multiplexes rate-matched radio frames from each service.<br>
A physical channel segmenter 160 segments the multiplexed radio frames<br>
received from the MUX 150 into physical channel blocks. A 2nd interleaver 170<br>
interleaves the physical channel blocks received from the physical channel<br>
segmenter 160. A physical channel mapper 180 maps the 2nd-interleaved blocks<br>
on physical channels for transmission.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the UMTS uplink transmitting device is provided<br>
with rate matchers 140. The rate matcher 140 varies in configuration depending<br>
on whether the channel encoder 110 is a convolutional encoder or a turbo encoder.<br>
When a linear block code is used (a convolutional encoder and a single<br>
decoder are used in this case) for the channel encoder, the following<br>
requirements of rate matching should be satisfied to increase data transmission<br>
efficiency and system performance in a multiple-access/multiple-channel scheme.<br>
1. An input symbol sequence is punctured/repeated in a predetermined<br>
periodic pattern.<br>
2. The number of punctured symbols is minimized whereas the number of<br>
repeated symbols is maximized.<br>
3. A uniform puncturing/repeating pattern is used to puncture/repeat<br>
encoded symbols uniformly.<br>
The above requirements are set on the assumption that the error<br>
sensitivity of a code symbol at any position in one frame output from a<br>
convolutional encoder is similar. Although some favorable results can be<br>
produced in the above requirement, a rate matching scheme different from the<br>
convolutional encoder should be employed when using a turbo encoder because of<br>
the different error sensitivities of symbols at different positions in one frame.<br>
When a turbo encoder is used, it is preferred that the systematic<br>
information part of the encoded symbols is not punctured since the turbo encoder<br>
is a systematic encoder. Due to the two component encoder structure of the<br>
turbo encoder, the minimum free distance of the output code is maximized when<br>
the free distance of each of the two component codes is maximized.. To do so,<br>
the output symbols of the two component encoders should be punctured equally to<br>
thereby achieve optimal performance.<br>
As described above, a distinction should be made between the<br>
information symbols and the parity symbols in the encoded symbols when a turbo<br>
encoder is used, to achieve optimal rate matching. Processing, such as channel<br>
interleaving, can be interposed between the turbo encoder and a rate matcher.<br>
Nevertheless, the distinction between information symbols and parity symbols<br>
should be preserved. However, this is impossible because all of the channel<br>
encoded symbols are randomly mixed after channel interleaving.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method<br>
for performing rate matching separately on information symbols and parity<br>
symbols during symbol encoding in an uplink transmitting device of a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for disposing a DEMUX before a rate matcher in order to separate symbol<br>
data into information symbols and parity symbols in a mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for controlling a DEMUX and a MUX for use in rate matching in an<br>
uplink transmitting device of a mobile communication system.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for controlling a DEMUX and a MUX for use in the rate matching of a<br>
turbo-encoded signal in an uplink transmitting device of a mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, there is provided a transmitting<br>
device in a mobile communication system. In the preferred embodiments of the<br>
transmitting device, an encoder receives an information bit stream in a frame as<br>
long as an integer multiple of a predetermined size and generates an information<br>
symbol and first and second parity symbols by encoding each information bit.<br>
An interleaver sequentially arranges information symbols and the first and<br>
second parity symbols corresponding to each of the information symbols row by<br>
row in an array having number of rows and number of columns. The number<br>
of rows and the number of columns in the array are both integers., reorders the<br>
columns according to a predetermined rule, reading the symbols down by column<br>
from left to right, and outputs a plurality of radio frames in a stream, each radio<br>
frame having a size determined by L/(TTI/10ms), where L is number of coded<br>
symbols. A demultiplexer demultiplexes each of the radio frames received from<br>
the interleaver to the information symbols, the first parity symbols, and the second<br>
parity symbols of the radio frame. Rate matchers bypass the information<br>
symbols and puncture or repeat the first and second parity symbols for rate<br>
matching.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
For rate matching, the UMTS uplink transmitting device of FIG. 1 has<br>
rate matcher 140 that varies in structure depending on whether channel encoder<br>
110 is a convolutional encoder or a turbo encoder, as stated before. When a<br>
turbo encoder is used as the channel encoder 110 according to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the rate matcher 140 is so constituted as to<br>
include a DEMUX 141, component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144, and a MUX<br>
145, as shown in FIG. 2. The DEMUX 141 separates the output symbols of the<br>
radio frame segmenter 130 into information symbols and parity symbols and<br>
switches them to the corresponding component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144.<br>
The MUX 145 multiplexes symbols received from the component rate matchers<br>
142, 143, and 144 and feeds the multiplexed symbols to the MUX 150 of FIG. 1.<br>
The uplink transmitting device shown in FIG. 2 is so constituted that the<br>
systematic information symbols of encoded symbols is not punctured in view of<br>
the fact that a turbo code is a systematic code. It is preferred that the two<br>
component encoders are connected in parallel in the turbo encoder and that the<br>
minimum free distance between final codes maximizes that of each component<br>
encoder. The consideration that the best performance can be achieved by equal<br>
puncturing of the output symbols of the two component encoders is reflected in<br>
the constitution of the uplink transmitting device in FIG. 2.<br>
According to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
DEMUX 141 is located between radio frame segmenter 130 and component rate<br>
matchers 142, 143, and 144, while MUX 145 is located between component rate<br>
matchers 142, 143, and 144 and MUX 150 in the uplink transmitting device.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 2, the<br>
DEMUX 141 and MUX 145 are synchronized with each other such that the<br>
DEMUX 141 and MUX 145 switch to the same rate matcher block (i.e., if<br>
DEMUX 141 switches to rate matcher 142 to input a symbol into the DEMUX<br>
141, then MUX also switches to the rate matcher 142 after the input symbol has<br>
been rate matched to receive the rate matched symbol.).<br>
The turbo code used in turbo encoder 110 of FIG. 2 is a systematic code<br>
and, thusly, can be separated into a systematic information symbol Xk and parity<br>
symbol Yk and Zk. For turbo encoder 110, code rate R = 1/3. Hereinafter, the<br>
systematic information symbol will be labeled with x and the first parity symbols<br>
with y and second parity symbols with z. When R = 1/3, the relationship<br>
between the input and output of the turbo encoder 110 is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the turbo encoder output is a sequence of an<br>
information symbol xb a first parity symbol y,, a second parity symbol zl, an<br>
information symbol x2, a first parity symbol y2, a seconda parity symbol z2, an<br>
information symbol x3, a first parity symbol y3, a second parity symbol z3, ... in<br>
this order.<br>
The 1st interleaver 120 interleaves encoded symbols at a TTI<br>
(Transmission Time Interval) according to the number of input symbols.<br>
Interleaving can be considered in two steps.<br>
First Step<br>
1. The total number of columns is determined referring to Table 1 shown<br>
below.<br>
2. A minimum integer R, is found in an equation given by<br><br>
where R, is the number of rows, K, is the length of the input block(total encoded<br>
symbols) and C, is number of column, wherein the number of column C, is 1, 2, 4<br>
or 8 according to TTIs.<br>
3. The input symbols of lst-interleaver iare sequentially arranged by rows<br>
in an rectangular array having R, rows and C, columns.<br>
Second Step<br>
1. Columns are reordered according to an inter-column permutation<br>
pattern {P1(j)} (j = 0, 1, ..., C-1) shown in Table 1. P1(j) represents the original<br>
I=R1xC1-K1 .....(2)<br>
By interleaving using Eqs. 1 and 2, the l5t interleaver 120 outputs<br>
interleaved symbols in the similar pattern as a turbo encoder output pattern, that is,<br>
in the pattern of x, y, z, x, y, z, ... (or x, z, y, x, z, y, ... with parity symbols z and y<br>
exchanged in position).<br>
When TTI is 10ms, the number of column C, is 1. Therefore, the 1st<br>
interleaver input and the 1st interleaver output are identical.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates an example of lst-interleaver input after turbo-encoding<br>
160 input bits at R - 1/3 and the TTI=80ms. In FIG. 4, a blank rectangle denotes a<br>
system information symbol x, a rectangle marked with slant lines denotes a first<br>
parity symbol y, and a rectangle marked black denotes a second parity symbol z.<br>
In FIG. 4, the 1st interleaver 120 sequentially receives code symbols 1, 2,<br>
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 160 from the turbo encoder 110. Each number<br>
represents an order of encoded symbol received from the turbo encoder 110.<br>
The numbers also indicate the order by which each of the numbers has been<br>
received in the interleaver 120. (i.e., T has been received first by the<br>
interleaver 120, '2' has been received second, etc.). Because of the nature of a<br>
turbo code, the 1 "-interleaver input follows the pattern of x, y, z, x, y, z, x, y, z, ....<br>
FIG. 5A illustrates an example of 1 "-interleaver output when R = 1/3 and<br>
TTI = 20ms. Referring to FIG. 5A, the 1 "-interleaver output sequence is 1,3, 5,<br>
7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ..., 160 in an interleaved order in the pattern of x, z, y, x, z,<br>
y, x, z, y, ....<br>
FIG. 5B illustrates an example of 1 "-interleaver output when R = 1/3 and<br>
TTI = 40ms. Referring to FIG. 5B, the 1 "-interleaver output sequence is 1,5, 9,<br>
13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, ..., 160 in an interleaved order in the pattern of x, y, z, x, y,<br>
z, x, y, z ....<br>
FIG. 5C illustrates an example of 1 "-interleaver output when R = 1/3 and<br>
TTI = 80ms. Referring to FIG. 5C, the 1 "-interleaver output sequence is 1,9, 17,<br>
25, 33, 41, 49, 57, 65, ..., 160 in an .interleaved order in the pattern of x, z, y, x, z,<br>
y, x, z, y ....<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an example of lst-mterleaver input after turbo encoding<br>
160 input bits at code rate R = 1/2 and TTI= 80ms. When TTI = 10ms, the 1st-<br>
interleaver input is identical to the lst-interleaver output. In FIG. 6, a blank<br>
rectangle denotes a system information symbol x and a rectangle marked with<br>
black dots denotes a parity symbol y.<br>
In FIG. 6, the lstinterleaver 120 sequentially receives encoded symbols 1,<br>
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 160 from the turbo encoder 110. Each number<br>
represents an order of encoded symbol received from the turbo encoder 110.<br>
Because of the nature of the turbo code, the lst-interleaver input follows the<br>
pattern of x, y, x, y, x, y, ....<br>
FIG. 7A illustrates an example of lst-interleaver output when R = 1/2 and<br>
TTI = 20ms. Referring to FIG. 7 A, the lst-interleaver output sequence is 1,3, 5,<br>
7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ..., 159, 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 160 in an interleaved order. The<br>
first half {1, 3, 5, ..., 159} of the interleaver output is information symbols x, and<br>
the last half {2, 4, 6, ..., 160} is parity symbols y. That is, the information<br>
symbols are followed by the parity symbols in the 1 "-interleaver output.<br>
FIG. 7B illustrates an example of lst-interleaver output when R = 1/2 and<br>
TTI = 40ms. Referring to FIG. 7B, the lst-interleaver output sequence is 1,5, 9,<br>
13, ..., 155, 159, 2, 6, 10, 14, ..., 156, 160 in an interleaved order. The first half<br>
{1, 5, 9, 13, ..., 159} of the interleaver output is information symbols x, and the<br>
last half {2, 6, 10, 14, ..., 156, 160} is parity symbols y. That is, the information<br>
symbols are followed by the parity symbols in the lst-interleaver output.<br>
FIG. 7C illustrates an example of 1 "-interleaver output when R = 1/2 and<br>
TTI = 80ms. Referring to FIG. 7C, the 1 "-interleaver output sequence is 1,9, 17,<br>
25, ..., 127, 135, 143, 151, 159, 2, 10, 18, ..., 144, 152, 160 in an interleaved order.<br>
The first half {1, 9, 17, 25, ..., 143, 151, 159} of the interleaver output is<br>
information symbols x, and the last half {2, 10, 18, ..., 144, 152, 160} is parity<br>
symbols y. That is, the information symbols are followed by the parity symbols<br>
in the 1 "-interleaver output.<br>
The interleaver outputs shown in FIGs. 5A, 5B, and 5C are given on the<br>
assumption that an interleaver size (= 160) is an integer multiple of TTI/10ms (=<br>
1, 2, 4, or 8). In case an interleaver size is not an integer multiple of TTI/10ms, a<br>
different 1 "-interleaver output is produced.<br>
The radio frame segmenter 130 of FIG. 2 segments a frame of 10, 20, 40,<br>
or 80ms into 10-ms radio frame blocks. Because the ratio (L/T) of an input<br>
frame size (L) to the TTI (T=TTI/10ms) of an input frame is not always an integer,<br>
the number (r) of filler bits is calculated by Eq. 3 to compensate for L/T with the<br>
filler bits ( L is in units of bits or symbols). Here, Te {1,2,4,8}. If the input<br>
frame size(number of coded symbol) of the first interleaever is an integer multiple<br>
of TTI/10ms, the filler bit is not needed(r=0). If the TTI is 20ms and the input<br>
frame size is not an integer multiple of 2(TTI/10ms), the number of filler bit r is 1.<br>
If the TTI is 40ms and the input frame size is not an integer multiple of 4, the<br>
number of filler bit r can be 1, to 3. If the TTI is 80ms and the input frame size is<br>
not an integer multiple of 8, the number of filler bit can be 1 to 7. The (L+r)/T<br>
value resulting from the filler bits is defined as R(number of row).<br>
r = T - (L mod T) .....(3)<br>
where r e {0, 1,2,3,... T-l}.<br><br>
If r is not 0, the radio frame segmenter 130 inserts a filler bit into the last<br>
bit position of a corresponding frame from a (T-r+l)th radio frame in order to<br>
maintain a radio frame size of R. The filler bit is arbitrarily chosen as a 0 or 1.<br>
Now a description will be made of the bit-basis operation of the radio frame<br>
segmenter 130.<br>
For description of bits prior to processing in the radio frame segmenter<br>
130, it is assumed that the number of filler bits r has been calculated. Here, t<br>
represents the index of a radio frame, ranging from 1 through T (1=t=T). t = 1<br>
for the first radio frame, t = 2 for the second radio frame, and similarly, t = T for<br>
the last radio frame. Each radio frame is the same size (L+r)/T. It is assumed<br>
that the lst-interleaver output is b1, b2, ..., bL, T (=TTI/10ms) e {1, 2, 4, 8}, and<br>
the radio frame segmenter output symbols are c1; c,, ..., c(L+r)/Tin a 10-ms frame.<br>
Then,<br>
The purpose of using the component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144 of<br>
FIG. 2 is to increase the data transmission efficiency and improve system<br>
performance in a multiple-access/multiple-channel system using the above-<br>
described channel encoding mechanism. Rate matching refers to control of input<br>
bit number to output bit number through puncturing when the input size is larger<br>
than the output size or repetition when the input size is smaller than the output<br>
size. The symbol puncturing or repetition is generally performed periodically<br>
but the following should be considered for rate matching when a turbo code is<br>
used.<br>
1. Because the turbo code is a systematic code, a systematic information<br>
symbol part of encoded symbols should be excluded from puncturing.<br>
2. The minimum free distance between final codes preferably maximizes<br>
that of each component encoder since two component encoders are connected in<br>
parallel in a turbo encoder by definition of a turbo code. Therefore, the output<br>
symbols of the two component encoders should be equally punctured to achieve<br>
optimal performance.<br>
In the rate matching structure shown in FIG. 2, rate matching is<br>
implemented separately for each component rate machers. The first, second, and<br>
third component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144 subject an information symbol x,<br>
a first parity symbol y, and a second parity symbol z, respectively, to rate<br>
matching. According to a given input and output sizes, each rate matcher<br>
performs puncturing/repetition on a predetermined number of symbols. This rate<br>
matching structure is built on the assumption that the DEMUX 141 outputs x, y, z,<br>
separately. Hence, the DEMUX 141 should be able to separate a radio frame<br>
received from the radio frame segmenter 130 into symbol x, y, z in a certain order.<br>
A description of radio frame output patterns of the radio frame segmenter<br>
130 will be given. Radio frames are read down by columns and each column<br>
corresponds to a radio frame.<br>
FIG. 8A illustrates an output pattern of the radio frame segmenter 130<br>
when R = 1/3 and TTI = 10ms. Referring to FIG. 8A, a radio frame output pattern<br>
is identical to a radio frame input pattern, that is, x, y, z, x, y, z, ....<br>
FIG. 8B illustrates an output pattern of the radio frame segmenter 130<br>
when code rate R = 1/3 and TTI = 20ms. Referring to FIG. 8B, a first radio<br>
frame RF #1 is output in the pattern of x, z, y, x, z, y, ... and a second radio frame<br>
RF #2 is output in a radio frame pattern of ..., x, y, x, z, y, x, z, .... The<br>
output patterns correspond to the output from-the 1 st interleaver shown in Fig. 5A.<br>
FIG. 8C illustrates an output pattern of the radio frame segmenter 130<br>
when R = 1/3 and TTI = 40ms. Referring to FIG. 8C, a first radio frame RF #1<br>
is output in the pattern of..., x, y, z, x, y, z, ..., a second radio frame RF #2 in the<br>
pattern of..., z, x, y, z, x, y, ..., a third radio frame RF #3 in the pattern of..., y, z,<br>
x, y, z, x, ..., and a fourth radio frame RF #4 in the pattern of..., x, y, z, x, y, z, ....<br>
The output patterns correspond to the output from the 1 st interleaver shown in Fig.<br>
5B.<br>
FIG. 8D illustrates an output pattern of the radio frame segmenter 130<br>
when R = 1/3 and TTI = 80ms. Referring to FIG. 8D, a first radio frame RF #1<br>
is output in the pattern of ..., x, z, y, x, z, y, ..., a second radio frame RF #2 in the<br>
pattern of ..., y, x, z, y, x, z, ..., a third radio frame RF #3 in the pattern of ..., z, y,<br>
x, z, y, x, ..., a fourth radio frame RF #4 in the pattern of ..., x, z, y, x, z, y, ..., a<br>
fifth radio frame RF #5 in the pattern of ..., y, x, z, y, x, z, ..., a sixth radio frame<br>
#6 in the pattern of ..., z, y, x, z, y, x, a seventh radio frame RF #7 in the pattern<br>
of ..., x, z, y, x, z, y, ..., and an eighth radio frame RF #8 in the pattern of ..., y, x,<br>
z, y, x, z, .... The output patterns correspond to the output from the 1 st interleaver<br>
shown in Fig. 5C.<br>
Output patterns of the radio frame segmenter 130 have a certain regularity.<br>
Each radio frame pattern with the same TTI has a different initial symbol x, y, or<br>
z but has the same symbol repeating pattern. For TTIs = 10ms and 40ms,<br>
symbol are repeated in the pattern of ..., x, y, z, x, y, z, ..., and for TTIs = 20ms<br>
and 80ms, symbols are repeated in the pattern of x, z, y, x, z, y, ....<br>
The radio frames in the above cases are free of a filler bit. This is<br>
because the input size is an integer multiple of TTI/lOms. When filler bits are to<br>
be inserted, radio frames have different patterns from the above-described patterns.<br>
The first through fourth embodiments as described below pertain to insertion of<br>
filler bits.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
FIGs. 9A, 9B, and 9C illustrate lst-interleaver input, lst-interleaver output,<br>
and radio frame segmenter output according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
If the input of the 1st interleaver 120 for TTI = 80ms is given in FIG. 9A,<br>
it is interleaved by columns according to an interleaving rule of the 1st interleaver<br>
120, as shown in FIG. 9B. Then, symbols are read down each column starting<br>
from the left to the right column in the array of FIG. 9B. The resulting 1st-<br>
interleaver output (i.e, the radio segmenter input) is x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, y, z, y, x,<br>
z, y, x, z, y, x, y, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, y. The output of the<br>
radio frame segmenter 130 results from adding filler bits to the radio frame<br>
segmenter input.<br>
In the first embodiment, the filler bits are 0s. In the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the radio frame segmenter 130 outputs the symbols received<br>
from the interleaver 120 in a such way that the all of the filler bits are placed<br>
towards the end of the last row, as shown in Fig. 9C. In Fig. 9B, the last<br>
positions in the second, fourth, sixth and eight columns are empty. Instead of<br>
filling those positions with filler bits, the next symbol coming after the empty<br>
position is used to fill the empty position. For example, to fill the last position in<br>
the second column, the 'z' symbol from the first position in the third column is<br>
moved in to the empty position in the second column. The position previously<br>
occupied by the 'z' symbol is now occupied by the 'y' symbol which came after<br>
the 'z' symbol in the third column. Basically the positions of the symbols have<br>
been pushed up by one position. This process is repeated to fill the empty<br>
position in the fourth column, and so on. However, the last positions in the last<br>
four columns (i.e., column #5, 6, 7 and 8) are filled with the filler bits so that the<br>
filler bits are pushed towards the end of the last row, as shown in Fig. 9C.<br>
Symbols in the array of FIG. 9C are read column by column and each column<br>
represents one radio frame. As shown in FIG. 9C, each radio frame has a<br>
different initial symbol but follows the same symbol repeating pattern of x, z, y,<br>
except for radio frames 4 and 6 because of the position shifting. However the<br>
repeating patterns for the radio frames 4 and 6 are shown in table 15, which can<br>
be used. . The patterns in the radio frames follow the predetermined repeating<br>
patterns shown in Table 15 except for the tail ends of certain radio frames. In<br>
those cases, the tail ends are ignored and treated as if the tail ends follow the<br>
predetermined repeating patterns shown in Table 15 and are rated matched<br>
according to the predetermined repeating patterns..... That is, the radio frames<br>
have different initial symbols in the filler bit inserting case, as compared to the<br>
filler bit-free case.<br>
Although filler bits are inserted, radio frames may have the same initial<br>
symbols as those in the filler bit-free case. An example of such a case using<br>
three filler bits for TTI = 40ms will be described.<br>
FIGs. 10A and 10B illustrate lst-interleaver input, lsl-interleaver output,<br>
and radio frame segmenter output according to the first embodiment.<br>
If the input of the lstinterleaver 120 for TTI — 40ms is given in FIG. 10A,<br>
it is interleaved by columns according to an interleaving rule of the lstinterleaver<br>
120 as shown in FIG. 10B. The resulting lst-interleaver output (i.e, the radio<br>
segmenter input) is x, y, z, x, y, z, z, x, y, z, x, y, z, x, y, z, x, y, z, x, y. The<br>
output of the radio frame segmenter 130 shown in FIG. 10C results from adding<br>
filler bits to the radio frame segmenter input.<br>
The filler bits are 0s. Symbols in the array of FIG. 10C are read<br>
column by column and each column represents one radio frame. As shown in<br>
FIG. 10C, each radio frame has a different initial symbol but follows the same<br>
symbol repetition pattern of ..., x, y, z, .... That is, the radio frames have the<br>
same initial symbols in this filler bit inserting case as those in the filler bit-free<br>
case.<br>
The initial symbol of each radio frame is determined by a TTI and the<br>
number of filler bits added by the radio frame segmenter 130. Herein below,<br>
initial symbols in all possible cases will be described. Tables 3 to 6 list initial<br>
symbols for TTIs = 10, 20, 40, and 80ms, respectively, when the radio frame<br>
segmenter 130 outputs radio frames RF#1, RF #2, RF #3, RF #4, RF #5, RF #6,<br>
RF #7, and RF #8 sequentially.<br><br>
In Table 4, since the 1st interleaver 120 leaves the columns intact,<br>
positions are not changed when one filler bit is used. Consequently, the initial<br>
symbols are the same as those in the filler bit-free case.<br><br>
When one or three filler bits are used, the number of symbols in each<br>
column before interleaving is equal to that of symbols in the column of the same<br>
index after interleaving. Therefore, the initial symbols are the same as those in<br>
the filler bit-free case. If two filler bits are used, the number of symbols in each<br>
column before interleaving is different from that of symbols in the column of the<br>
same index after interleaving. Therefore, the initial symbols are different from<br>
those in the filler bit-free case.<br>
When one or seven filler bits are used, the number of symbols in each<br>
column before interleaving is equal to that of symbols in the column of the same<br>
index after interleaving. Therefore, the initial symbols are the same as those in<br>
the filler bit-free case. If two, three, four, five, or six filler bits are used, the<br>
number of symbols in each column before interleaving is different from that of<br>
symbols in the column of the same index after interleaving. Therefore, the initial<br>
symbols are different from those in the filler bit-free case.<br>
As noted from the above tables, symbols are repeated in the pattern of x,<br>
y, z, x, y, z, for TTIs = 10ms and 40ms, whereas symbols are repeated in the<br>
pattern of x, z, y, x, z, y, for TTIs = 20ms and 80ms.<br>
Therefore, given a TTI and the number of filler bits to be inserted by the<br>
radio frame segmenter 130, the DEMUX 141 demultiplexes lst-interleaver output<br>
in the above-described manner.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
FIGs. 11A to 11D illustrate lst-interleaver input, lst-interleaver output,<br>
and radio frame segmenter output according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The second embodiment is different from the first<br>
embodiments in that filler bits are inserted by the lstinterleaver 120 instead of the<br>
radio frame segmenter 130. Instead of pushing the filler bit positions to the end<br>
of the last row, as in the first embodiment, the interleaver 120 fills the empty<br>
positions with filler bits, as shown in 9C. In terms of initial symbols and<br>
repeating patterns, this case is the same as the typical filler bit-free case.<br>
If the input of the 1st interleaver 120 for TTI = 80ms is given as in FIG.<br>
11 A, it is interleaved by columns according to an interleaving rule of the 1st<br>
interleaver 120 as shown in FIG. 1 IB. Then, filler bits are inserted to the array<br>
of FIG. 1 IB as shown in FIG. 11C. Here, the filler bits are Os. Therefore, the<br>
lst-interleaver output, i.e., the radio frame segmenter input is a sequence of x, z, y,<br>
x, z, y, z, y, 0, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, 0, y, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, 0, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z,<br>
y, 0. The output of the radio frame segmenter 130 is shown in FIG. 1 ID.<br>
The symbols in the array of FIG. 1 ID are read down by column from left<br>
to right and each column is a radio frame. As shown in FIG. 11D, each radio<br>
frame follows the same repeating pattern of x, z, y with a different initial symbol.<br>
As noted from FIGs. 11A to 1 ID, the initial symbols are the same as those in the<br>
general filler bit-free case.<br>
The initial symbol of each radio frame is determined by a TTI. Tables 7<br>
to 10 list initial symbols for TTIs = 10, 20, 40, and 80ms, respectively, when the<br>
radio frame segmenter 130 outputs radio frames RF#1, RF #2, RF #3, RP #4, RF<br>
#5, RF #6, RF #7, and RF #8 sequentially. The initial symbols of the radio<br>
frames in the second embodiment are independent of the total number of the filler<br>
bits, as shown below; however, in the first embodiment, the initial symbols of the<br>
radio frames are dependent on the total number of the filler bits.<br>
As noted from the above tables, symbols are repeated in the pattern of x,<br>
y, z, x, y, z, for TTIs = 10ms and 40ms, whereas symbols are repeated in the<br>
pattern of x, z, y, x, z, y, for TTIs = 20ms and 80ms.<br>
Therefore, given a TTI, the DEMUX 141 demultiplexes lst-interleaver<br>
output in the above-described manner.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
FIGs. 12A, 12B, and 12C illustrate lst-interleaver input, lst-mterleaver<br>
output, and radio frame segmenter output according to a third embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The third embodiment is different from the second<br>
embodiments in that a controller(host) designates filler bit insertion positions and<br>
the radio frame segmenter 130 inserts the filler bits in the designated positions.<br>
In terms of initial symbols and repeating patterns, this case is the same as the<br>
typical filler bit-free case.<br>
If the input of the lstinterleaver 120 for TTI = 80ms is given in FIG. 12 A,<br>
it is interleaved by columns according to an interleaving rule of the lstinterleaver<br>
120 as shown in FIG. 12B. Therefore, the lst-interleaver output, i.e., the radio<br>
frame segmenter input is a sequence of x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, y, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, y, x,<br>
y, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, x, z, y, x, z, y, x, z, y. A controller(host) designates filler bit<br>
insertion positions and then the radio frame segmenter 130 inserts the filler bits in<br>
the designated positions as shown in FIG. 12C.<br>
In this embodiment, the filler bits are 0s. The symbols in the array of<br>
FIG. 12C are read down column by column from left to right and each column<br>
is a radio frame. As shown in FIG. 12C, each radio frame follows the same<br>
repeating pattern of x, z, y with a different initial symbol. As noted from FIGs.<br>
12A, 12B, and 12C, initial symbols are the same as those in the general filler bit-<br>
free case.<br>
The initial symbol of each radio frame is determined by a TTI. Tables<br>
11 to 14 list initial symbols for TTIs = 10, 20, 40, and 80ms, respectively, when<br>
the radio frame segmenter 130 outputs radio frames RF#1, RF #2, RF #3, RF #4,<br>
RF #5, RF #6, RF #7, and RF #8 sequentially. The initial symbols of the radio<br>
frames in the third embodiment are independent of the total number of the filler<br>
bits, as shown below.<br>
As noted from the above tables, symbols are repeated in the pattern of x,<br>
y, z, x, y, z, for TTIs = 10ms and 40ms, whereas symbols are repeated in the<br>
pattern of x, z, y, x, z, y, for TTIs = 20ms and 80ms.<br>
Given a TTI, the DEMUX 141 demultiplexes lSI-interleaver output in the<br>
above-described manner.<br>
Returning to FIG. 2, the DEMUX 141 demultiplexes a radio frame<br>
received from the radio frame segmenter 130 into its symbols x, y, z, according to<br>
a switching rule. The switching rule is determined by a TTI and the number of<br>
filler bits used by the radio frame segmenter 130 in the first embodiment and a<br>
TTI in the second and third embodiments. The symbols are repeated in a<br>
certain pattern. The repeating patterns for the embodiments are tabulated in<br>
Tables 15 and 16. In the tables, N/A indicates "not applicable".<br>
If two filler bits are used for TTI = 40ms in the first and second<br>
embodiments, the switching patterns in the DEMUX 141 are x, y, z, x, y, z for the<br>
first radio frame, z, x, y, z, x, y for the second radio frame, z, x, y, z, x, y for the<br>
third radio frame, and x, y, z, x, y, z for the fourth radio frame.<br>
In the second and third embodiments, the initial symbol of each radio<br>
frame only needs to be given because the repeating patterns are already<br>
predetermined based on the TTI. However, in the first embodiment, the total<br>
number of the filler bits also needs to be given in addition to the other information.<br>
Tables 17-19 reflect that difference between the embodiments out.<br>
(Table 17)<br>
For First and Second Embodiments<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 again, the MUX 145 multiplexes three streams<br>
received from the component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144 to one stream, to<br>
thereby generate a rate-matched radio frame with the same symbol pattern as<br>
before rate matching. Because this MUX 145 is the counterpart of the DEMUX<br>
141, it switches according to the same switching patterns.<br>
FIG. 13 is a block diagram of a DEMUX and MUX controlling apparatus<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, upon receipt of a TTI, the total number of the<br>
filler bits and a radio frame length from the host 200, the controller 210<br>
feeds the TTI, the total number of the filler bits, and the radio frame index of<br>
a current radio frame to the memory 220 (see Table 17) and receives the<br>
initial symbol of the current radio frame from the memory 220. The<br>
controller 210 controls the switching operations of the DEMUX 141 and the<br>
MUX 145 based on the initial symbol and a repeating/puncturing pattern<br>
determined by the TTI. The DEMUX 141 separates the current radio<br>
frame symbols into corresponding component rate machers input and the<br>
MUX 145 multiplexes the output symbols of the rate-matchersto a radio<br>
frame. Here, the DEMUX 141 separates an information symbol, a first<br>
parity symbol, and a second parity symbol from a radio frame stream<br>
received from the radio frame segmenter 130. The component rate<br>
matchers 142, 143, and 144 rate-match the information symbol, the first<br>
parity symbol, and the second parity symbol from the DEMUX 141,<br>
respectively, by puncturing or repetition. The component rate matcher 142<br>
just bypasses the received information symbols without real puncturing,<br>
whereas the component rate matchers 143 and 144 puncture the received<br>
parity symbols according to a pattern preset which determined by the ratio of<br>
the number of input symbols to the number of output symbols. Most of real<br>
cases, the component rate matcher 143 and 144 just bypasses the received<br>
parity symbols without real repetition except heavy repetition of the encoded<br>
symbols, whereas the component rate matchers 142 repeat the received<br>
information symbols according to a pattern preset determined by the ratio of<br>
the number of input symbols to the number of output symbols.<br>
The MUX 145 multiplexes the symbols received from the component rate<br>
matchers 142, 143, and 144 to one stream according to the same switching<br>
partem as used in the DEMUX 141.<br>
FIG. 14 is a block diagram of a DEMUX and MUX controlling apparatus<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, upon receipt of a TTI and a radio frame length from<br>
the host 200, the controller 210 feeds the TTI, the total number of filler bits, and<br>
the radio frame index of a current radio frame to memory 220 (see Table 17)<br>
and receives the initial symbol of the current radio frame from memory 220.<br>
The number of filler bits is determined by the controller 210 based on the TTI and<br>
the frame length in the same manner as used in the radio frame segmenter. Then,<br>
the controller 210 controls the switching operations of the DEMUX 141 and the<br>
MUX 145 based on the initial symbol and a repeating/puncturing pattern<br>
determined by the TTI. The DEMUX 141 separates the current radio frame<br>
symbols into component rate machers input and the MUX 145 multiplexes the<br>
output symbols of the rate-matchers to a radio frame. Here, the DEMUX 141<br>
separates an information symbol, a first parity symbol, and a second parity<br>
symbol from a radio frame stream received from the radio frame segmenter 130.<br>
The component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144 rate-match the information<br>
symbol, the first parity symbol, and the second parity symbol from the DEMUX<br>
141, respectively, by puncturing or repetition. The component rate matcher 142<br>
just, bypasses the received information symbol without real puncturing, whereas<br>
component rate matchers 143 and 144 puncture the received parity symbols<br>
according to a pattern preset determined by the ratio of the number of input<br>
symbols to the number of output symbols. In most of real cases, the component<br>
rate matchers 143 and 144 just bypass the received parity symbols without real<br>
repetition except heavy repetition of the encoded symbols, whereas the<br>
component rate matchers 142 repeat the received information symbols according<br>
to a pattern preset determined by the ratio of the number of input symbols to the<br>
number of output symbols. The MUX 145 multiplexes the symbols received from<br>
the component rate matchers 142, 143, and 144 to one stream according to the<br>
same switching pattern as used in the DEMUX 141.<br>
FIG. 15 is a block diagram of a DEMUX and MUX controlling apparatus<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, upon receipt of a TTI and a radio frame length from<br>
the host 200, the controller 210 feeds the TTI and the radio frame index of a<br>
current radio frame to memory 220 (see Table 18) and receives the initial symbol<br>
of the current radio frame from memory 220. Then, the controller 210 controls<br>
the switching, operations of the DEMUX 141 and the MUX 145 based on the<br>
initial symbol and a repeating/puncturing pattern determined by the TTI. The<br>
DEMUX 141 separates the current radio frame symbols into component rate<br>
machers input and the MUX 145 multiplexes the output symbols of the rate<br>
machers to a radio frame. Here, the DEMUX 141 separates an information<br>
symbol, a first parity symbol, and a second parity symbol from a radio frame<br>
stream received from the radio frame segmenter 130. The component rate<br>
matchers 142, 143, and 144 rate-match the information symbol, the first parity<br>
symbol, and the second parity symbol from the DEMUX 141, respectively, by<br>
puncturing or repetition. The component rate matcher 142 just bypasses the<br>
received information symbol without real rate puncturing, whereas component<br>
rate matchers 143 and 144 puncture or repeat the received parity symbols<br>
according to a pattern preset determined by the ratio of the number of input<br>
symbols to the number of output symbols. The MUX 145 multiplexes the<br>
symbols received from the component rate matchers 142, 143, and 145 to one<br>
