Supply circuit and device comprising a supply circuit<br>
The invention relates to a supply circuit for supplying an output signal to a load, and also relates to a device comprising a supply circuit, to a method, to a computer program product, and to a medium for storing the computer program product.<br>
Examples of such a supply circuit are switched mode power supplies, without excluding other supply circuits. Examples of such a load are one light emitting diode and two or more serial light emitting diodes and two or more parallel light emitting diodes, without excluding other loads.<br>
A prior art supply circuit is known from US 6,853,150 B2, which discloses a supply circuit comprising a transistor circuit with two transistors in a half bridge configuration and comprising an impedance circuit with an inductor and capacitors each coupled to light emitting diodes.<br>
The prior art supply circuit is disadvantageous, inter alia, in that a fluctuation in an input signal and/or a fluctuation in a voltage drop across the light emitting diodes may result in a fluctuation in an output signal, which may result in a fluctuation in a brightness of a light emitting diode.<br>

In general, a galvanic isolating driver topology and a control scheme for Light Emitting Diodes or LEDs have been created. The input voltage Uin can be a non-stabilized DC voltage. The driver consists of a transistor H-bridge 11-14, a controlling third circuit 3 for the H-bridge 11-14, a transformer 25, a series capacitor 27, a diode bridge 21 -24 and a smoothing output capacitor 28. At the output, a series connection of LEDs can be supplied.<br>
The transformer 25 serves for galvanic isolation and may adapt the voltage level, e.g. from 300V to 30V. A resonant topology is formed by the stray inductance 26 of the transformer 25 and the series capacitor 27. Thus, the parasitic leakage inductance of the transformer 25 can be part of the driver. Contrary to Pulse<br>
 <br>
Width Modulation based converters such as forward or fly back topologies, here the leakage inductance does not need to be minimized. This is of advantage for the isolation and winding design and it thus keeps the cost low.<br>
The controlling third circuit 3 and the logical circuitry 5 generate alternated positive and negative voltage pulses with a fixed pulse width. Between these voltage pulses the H-bridge 11-14 should stay in a free wheel state for a settable time. Hence, the output is controlled by the repetition frequency. If the resonant frequency of the circuit is properly adapted to the width of the voltage pulse and if the number of LEDs meets the operation voltage range of the circuit, an ideal LED supply driver has been created that shows the following features:<br>
The current in the driver becomes sinusoidal and it is zero at the switching instants. This avoids switching losses and minimizes EMI.<br>
The average current in the LEDs is proportional to the DC input voltage of the driver and to the operating frequency. This means the voltage drops of the LEDs do not affect the current over a large load range. If the product of the DC input voltage times the frequency is kept constant, the average current in the LEDs is constant as well. Moreover the LED current can be varied from a nominal value down to zero.<br>
The LED driver system neither requires sensors nor control units on the secondary (LED) side.<br>
Changes of the LED parameters do not affect the current in the LEDs. This also includes a short circuit of a single LED. The overall voltage drop of all LEDs may vary between 33% to 100%.<br>
The nominal output voltage can be set by the turn ratio of the transformer 25.<br>
The lighting system is very suitable for mains supply.<br>
A dimming function can easily be installed.<br>
The power and control unit can be integrated in a smart power IC.<br>
More in particular, any none stabilized DC voltage Uin can be used to supply the driver. This voltage may be generated from the AC mains by using a further diode bridge 41-44 and a further smoothing capacitor 46. The power part of the driver consists of an H-bridge realized by 4 transistors 11-14. These transistors are controlled<br>
 <br>
by the third circuit 3 via the logical circuitry 5. Voltage level shifters may be used as interfaces between the control electrodes of the transistors 11-14 and the logical circuitry 5.<br>
The output terminals of the H-bridge 11-14 are connected to the primary winding of the transformer 25 via a series capacitor 27. The secondary winding of the transformer 25 feeds the diode bridge 21-24. This diode bridge 21-24 rectifies the AC voltage from the transformer 25 and a smoothing capacitor 28 is used to smooth the output voltage Uout. The series connection of an arbitrary number of LEDs is supplied by the output voltage Uout.<br>
The series capacitor 27 and the stray inductance 26 of the transformer 25 form a series resonant circuit with a resonant frequency fres = (2n;)' (LaeCa?)"'^ = (Tres)" ' and with a resonant impedance Zres = (Lae/Ca?)"'"^'. The H-bridge 11-14 generates alternately positive and negative voltage pulses (+Uin or -Uin). The positive voltage pulse occurs if transistor 11 and transistor 14 are in the on state while the negative voltage pulse can be set turning on the transistors 12 and 13. Between the voltage pulses the H-bridge 11-14 provides a free wheel path, which may be performed either by turning on 11 and 13 or by turning on 12 and 14. The time width ton of the positive and negative pulses are preferably set equal to half the resonant period ton = Tres/2, without excluding other settings.<br>
In case the pulse width ton is fixed, the frequency fs can be used as a control parameter. Its maximum value has to be limited to finax = fres/2 &gt; fs. Fig. 5 shows a characteristic output voltage wave of the H-bridge 11-14 as well as a basic switching function s(t) generated inside the controlling third circuit 3.<br>
The nominal output voltage Uout may be determined by the number of LEDs connected in series and their voltage drops. It might stay within the voltage range<br>
N2 Uin / (3 N1) 
 <br>
Neglecting the magnetization current, the secondary current of the transformer 25 is proportional to the primary current 12 = II N1 / N2. The secondary transformer current 12 is rectified by the diode bridge 21 -24, with ID(t) = | I2(t) | shown in Fig. 7. Because of the smoothing capacitor 28 a DC output current is flowing in the load 6 which is equal to the average value of the rectified secondary current lout = IDrectified.<br>
The output current and thus the LED current is proportional to the frequency and the input voltage: lout = 2 Uin Nl fs / (Zres 7t N2 fres). Since the input voltage Uin varies with the mains voltage and because of a voltage ripple caused by a small fiirther smoothing capacitor 46, the frequency fs may be adapted in such a way that the product of Uin and fs and thus the output current lout is kept relatively constant.<br>
This can be achieved by the third circuit 3 without excluding other circuits. In a first step the unsigned voltage pulses to be generated by the switching function s(t) and the input DC voltage Uin are low pass filtered (e.g. by a RC network). The resulting DC voltage is proportional to the voltage frequency product. This voltage is converted into a current via the converter 33 and is compared with a reference current Iref and the difference sets the operating frequency fs via the controller 35. Thereto, the controller 35 controls the voltage controlled oscillator 36 that generates fs and that triggers the monoflop 37 that generates the control signal s(t) with pulses having a pulse width ton etc. Preferably, but not exclusively, ton = 1 / (2 fres). The turn on delay circuits 54a, 54b, 55a, 55b introduce a time delay tdon for avoiding a short circuit in the H bridge 11-14.<br>
Possible modifications are:<br>
Instead of MOSFETs any other transistor technology may be used.<br>
The smoothing capacitor 28 connected in parallel to the LEDs can be omitted. This has no influence on the average current but it increases the RMS and peak current of the LEDs.<br>
The free-wheel path of the H-bridge 11-14 could always be realized by turning on 12 and 14. In this case the turn on time of the upper transistors 11 and 13 is restricted to the constant pulse width ton which is an advantage.<br>
 <br>
The series capacitor 27 could also be inserted on the secondary transformer side or series capacitors may be used on both sides.<br>
The input rectifier may be realized by a PFC rectifier circuit.<br>
The driver may be realized without a transformer 25 but with an inductor such as a series choke for forming the resonant topology.<br>
The full bridge output rectifier 21 -24 could also be replaced by a combination of split output winding plus only two diodes with the benefit of saving two diodes and having less diode forward conduction losses (but at the price of needing a second winding and perhaps getting asymmetric LED peak currents for the positive and negative transformer input voltage).<br>
This invention might be used for wall flooding, LCD backlighting and general illumination, without excluding other applications with loads in the form of LEDs or in the form of non-LEDs.<br>
The supply circuit according to the invention shown in the Fig. 10 comprises a first circuit 101 comprising a half bridge with a serial transistor circuit of a first transistor 111 and a second transistor 112 coupled to a source Vo and comprises a second circuit 102 comprising a for example serial resonance circuit of a capacitor 127 and an inductor 126. One side of the serial resonance circuit is coupled to a common point of the serial transistor circuit and an other side is coupled to first and second (anti-parallel) branches. The first (second) branch comprises a diode 121A (121B) coupled to a parallel circuit of a capacitor 128A (128B) and for example serially coupled LEDs 106A(106B).<br>
Alternatively, the half bridge may be replaced by for example a full bridge in a half bridge mode. Further alternatively, the inductor 126 may be replaced by a transformer of which a primary side is coupled to the capacitor 127 and of which a secondary side is coupled to the branches.<br>
The supply circuit according to the invention shown in the Fig. 11 comprises a first circuit 101 comprising a half bridge with a serial transistor circuit of a first transistor 111 and a second transistor 112 coupled to a source Vo and comprises a second circuit 102 comprising a for example serial resonance circuit of a capacitor 127 and an inductor 126. One side of the serial resonance circuit is coupled to a common<br>
 <br>
i<br>
point of the serial transistor circuit and an other side is coupled to first and second (anti-parallel) branches. The first (second) branch comprises a first (second) serial diode-capacitor circuit of a diode 121C (121D) coupled to a capacitor 128C (128D). Common points of the serial diode-capacitor circuits are coupled to each other via for example serially coupled LEDs 106C. This is a voltage doubler with a two-capacitor construction.<br>
The supply circuit according to the invention shown in the Fig. 12 comprises the half bridge with the serial transistor circuit of the first transistor 111 and the second transistor 112 coupled to the source Vo already discussed for the Fig. 10 and 11 and comprises the for example serial resonance circuit of the capacitor 127 and the inductor 126 already discussed for the Fig. 10 and 11. One side of the serial resonance circuit is coupled to a capacitor 128E, which is coupled to an anode of a diode 121E and to a cathode of a diode 12 IF. These diodes 121E-121F are further coupled to for example serially coupled LEDs 106E. This is a voltage doubler with a one-capacitor construction.<br>
The supply circuit according to the invention shown in the Fig. 13 corresponds with the supply circuits shown in the Fig. 11 and 12 whereby the voltage doubler construction has been replaced by a Cockroft-Walton multiplier construction.<br>
In the Fig. 14, a voltage Vin supplied by a first circuit 101 and a voltage Vc across a capacitor 127 as a function of time are shown, and in the Fig. 15, a current through an inductor 126 as a function of time is shown for a switching period being equal to two times the resonance period of 126,127. In the Fig. 20 a voltage Vin and a current through an inductor 126 and an averaged current lol are shown for a switching period being greater than two times the resonance period of 126,127.<br>
The topology may be a combination of a half bridge for example driving a series tank and rectifier load branches at or below resonance. Thereby, the topology behaves like a voltage current converter, when for example both the input voltage and the switching frequency are constant then the output current is known, no additional shunts for constant current load driving are required, zero current switching is achieved, a resonant operating mode allows to increase a switching fi-equency for reducing a volume of passive components, it may work with or without transformer, it has an<br>
 <br>
inherent short circuit protection, it may have integrated magnetics for transformer based solutions whereby a transformer leakage inductance can be used as series tank inductor, it may have a sinusoidal tank current with a low EMI to allow an AC bus, it does not need cross regulation, so i.e. load variation in one output branch does not affect the current in the output, there is an implicit over voltage protection and it may be used to drive a voltage multiplier to increase an output voltage swing without a transformer (important for integration).<br>
hi the Fig. 10-15, Vo denotes a DC input voltage. 111 and 112 are for example MosFets of a half bridge, 127 and 126 are for example series resonant tank elements, 121 is an output rectifier diode, 106 is a load string of for example LEDs.<br>
In view of the Fig. 10, 14 and 15, for a steady state, the response can be subdivided into two states with two subintervals. The two states are defined by I) 121A is on &amp; 121B is off (State I) and by II) 121A is off and 121B is on (State II). The subintervals 1,2,3,4 as defined in the Fig. 14 and 15 may be of the same length: tl=t2= t3= t4 = T, where T denotes a resonance period: T=7t*'V( L1*C1). The switching period Ts may be chosen to be 4*T or greater. Setting up differential network equations for both states, observing continuity and periodicity conditions the relevant currents and voltages can be calculated analytically. Of importance may be the relations for the averaged current over one switching period Ts=l/fs in both load branches for each state: iavi=iav,i=2/7t* Vo/Zo*fs/fres, with Zo=V(Ll /C1).<br>
This equation shows, that the averaged output current is proportional to a product of the input dc voltage Vo and the switching frequency fs:<br>
If Vo is constant, the current through the loads is constant as well. Even the load &amp; cross regulation error is zero, which i.e. means that voltage changes on one branch do not affect the current neither of the same nor of the other branch. If the input voltage varies then the switching frequency may be adapted in such a way that the product of Vo and fs and thus the output current is kept relatively constant as well. This is shown in the Fig. 17 and 18 to be discussed below. So, the for example half-bridge topology behaves like an ideal voltage/current converter. Another important aspect is the peak load current for constant output power. Because the converter oscillates at resonance and the switching period is 4T there are 2 local current peaks in each state:<br>
 <br>
ipkli=!-0.5*(Vo-Voutl+Vout2)/Zo| and ipk2i=|-0.5*(Vo+VoutI-Vout2)/Zo|. It may be desirable to have both peaks balanced, i.e. more or less of the same size so that the peak current stress for a given power (averaged current) is minimum. Observing both expressions for the peak current of the converter according to the invention it can be seen that both values are balanced when the output voltages Voutl,Vout2 are small compared to Vo. This implies the proposed converter is perfectly suited for applications with small supply voltages like high power diodes where only a few LEDs are connected in series.<br>
In the Fig. 16, voltages and currents for different situations A-F as a fimction of time are shown, for example for Vout«Vo. A: input voltage full bridge without zero state, B: input voltage half bridge, C: input voltage full bridge with zero state, D: diode current full bridge without zero state, E: diode current half bridge, and F: diode current full bridge with zero state.<br>
In the Fig. 17, currents for different situations A-C as a function of time are shown (cross regulation). The current &amp; averaged current in a branch with a diode for varying an output voltage in a same branch shows that an averaged current is constant. Load parameter is ld=0,0.5,1 with Voutl=ld*Vout, Vout2=Vout, Vout=48V, Vin=100V.<br>
In the Fig. 18, currents for different situations A-C as a function of time are shown (all in one graph). The current &amp; averaged current in a branch for varying an output voltage in an other branch shows that an averaged current is constant. Parameter is ld=0,0.5,l with Voutl=ld*Vout; Vout2=Vout, Vout=48V and Vin=100V.<br>
So, a for example half bridge topology with a for example series resonant tank and for example rectified outputs has been created with for example dual one-way rectification and with for example a capacitor-diode voltage multiplier for example driven at Ts&gt;4*tau, where tau=pi*sqrt(L*C). Alternatively, a full bridge with variable driving may be introduced so that the full bridge is driven as either a half bridge (on &amp; off time: 2*tau, Ts&gt;4*tau) or as a full bridge without a free wheel state (on+ and on-time 2*tau, Ts&gt;4*tau) or as a full bridge with a free wheel state (on+ &amp; on-time=tau, free wheel state=tau following every pulse, Ts&gt;4*tau). In other words, although not shown in the Fig. 10-13, a third circuit may be used for driving the bridge according to<br>
 <br>
one or more of the four driving schemes as defined above, to reduce a dependency between the input signal and the output signal.<br>
The supply circuit according to the invention shown in the Fig. 19 comprises a first circuit 201 and a second circuit 202 and a third circuit 203. The first circuit 201 comprises a voltage source 204 for generating an input voltage signal Uin via first and second reference terminals 215 and 216. The first circuit 201 further comprises two transistors 211-212. A first transistor 211 has a first main electrode coupled to the first reference terminal 215 and has a second main electrode coupled to a first input 220a of the second circuit 202. A second transistor 212 has a first main electrode coupled to the second main electrode of the first transistor 211 and has a second main electrode coupled to the second reference terminal 216 which is further coupled to a second input 220b of the second circuit 202. The first circuit 201 fiirther comprises logical circuitry 205 coupled to the third circuit 203 and to the control electrodes of the transistors 211-212. This logical circuitry 205 is for example identical to a part of the logical circuitry 5 discussed before. The second circuit 202 is for example identical to the second circuit 2 discussed before.<br>
In the Fig. 20, a voltage Vin and a current through an inductor 126 and an averaged current lol are shown for a switching period being greater than two times the resonance period of 126,127. T = switching fi-equency, ton=Tres where Tres = resonance period.<br>
This Fig. 20 shows a timing for T&gt;2*Tres, where ton=Tres and TofP&gt;Tres. A minimum timing is T=2*Tres, where ton=Tres and Toff=Tres (as shown in Fig. 14-15).<br>
Summarizing, supply circuits 1-3,101-102,201-203 for supplying output current signals to loads 6,106,206 and comprising first circuits 1,101,201 with transistors 11-14,111-112,211-212 for converting input voltage signals into pulse signals and comprising second circuits 2,102,202 with resonance circuits for receiving the pulse signals and for supplying the output current signals to the loads 6,106,206 are provided with third circuits 3,203 for controlling the first circuits 1,101,201, which third circuits 3,203 comprise generators 35-37 for generating control signals for controlling the transistors 11-14,111-112,211-212 for reducing dependencies between the input<br>
 <br>
voltage signals and the output current signals. The third circuits 3,203 supply the control signals in dependence of the input voltage signals and independently from the output current signals. The transistors 11 -14, 111 -112,211 -212 may form a fiill bridge, a full bridge operated in a half bridge mode, or a half bridge.<br>
