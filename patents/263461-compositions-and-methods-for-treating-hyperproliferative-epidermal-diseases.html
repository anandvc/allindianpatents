				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TREATING HYPERPROLIFERATIVE EPIDERMAL DISEASES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions useful for the treatment of hyperproliferative dermal diseases. Specifically, the present invention provides a topical composition consisting essentially of vitamin D metabolite, calcipotriol, and nicotinamide, which is particularly effective in treating psoriasis and other related dermal disorders and diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hyperproliferative Skin Disorders and Diseases<br>
Hyperproliferative skin disorders refers to a set of diseases and disorders, which are characterized by a higher than normal level of proliferation of epidermal cells known as keratinocytes, and, as a rule, also by abnormal differentiation.<br>
The hyperproliferative epidermal pathology may be malignant or benign. Malignant hyperproliferative epidermal pathologies include: squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC), basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) and other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Representative examples of benign hyperproliferative epidermal pathologies include psoriasis, common warts, keratoacanthoma, seborrhoeic keratosis, seborrhea and ichthyosis.<br>
Psoriasis is a non-contagious skin disorder affecting up to 2% of the world's • population. It is estimated that ten million in the U.S. and Europe suffer from psoriasis and up to 260,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. In the U.S. alone there are over 1,500,000 clinic visits per year for psoriasis and the annual outpatient costs are currently estimated to be about US $2 billion.<br>
Psoriasis is caused by unknown factors that stimulate T-lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and cytokine release that leads to hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Although the etiology of psoriasis is unknown, the affected keratinocytes are responsible for<br>
the typical clinical features of the disease: well-demarcated inflamed skin lesions covered with a silvery white scale, covering about 10%-15% of the body surface. Psoriasis primarily affects adults and may manifest itself in different variations and degrees of severity.<br>
The main strategy fcr the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases, including psoriasis, is to prevent excessive keratinocyte division and to stimulate cell differentiation.<br>
At present there are three modalities of treatment for psoriasis:<br>
1)	Topical administration of therapeutic cream or ointment, for treating mild and<br>
moderate cases;<br>
2)	Phototherapy (UVA or UVB) used alone or in combination with medication or<br>
topical treatment, requires repeated visits to the clinic and exposes the patient to the<br>
concomitant dangers of radiation;<br>
3)	Systemic treatment, relying on immunosuppressive therapy, is limited to severe<br>
cases due to the serious side effects.<br>
Vitamin D and Hyperproliferative Skin Disease<br>
Vitamin D is a prohormone with several active metabolites that act as hormones. In the skin, previtamin D3 is synthesized photochemically from 7-dehydrocholesterol and is slowly isomerized to vitamin D3, which is removed by vitamin D-binding protein. In the liver, vitamin D3 is converted to 25(OH)D3, the major circulating form, which passes through the enterohepatic circulation and is reabsorbed from the gut. In the kidneys, it is further hydroxylated to the more metabolically active form, lα,25(OH)2D3 (lα,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, calcitriol, vitamin D hormone).<br>
Experimental evidence has shown that vitamin D functions as an anti-proliferative agent and stimulates the teiminal differentiation of keratinocytes. In psoriatic lesions, epidermal keratinocytes exhibit hyperproliferation and unpaired differentiation triggered by inflammation. Therefore, vitamin D and certain analogs are effective in treating psoriasis vulgaris (reviewed in DeLuca 1988; Lehmaim et al., 2004). The systemic administration of these compounds is limited by their toxicity and adverse effect on calcium metabolism, therefore topical preparations are preferred<br>
Calcipotriol (calcipotriene), a vitamin D3 derivative is marketed in the United States as a topical antipsoriatic under the trade name Dovonex® (USA) or Daivonex® (Europe). Calcipotriol is as potent as the naturally occurring calcitriol in regulating cell proliferation, but has the benefit of being much less active in its effect on calcium metabolism. Despite this, Calcipotriol is only partially effective in treating psoriatic lesions.<br>
The art provides some examples of vitamin D analogs and derivatives and compositions comprising the same.<br>
Vitamin D analogs are described in US Patent No. 4,851,401 (cyclopentano-vitamin D analogs), US Patent No. 5,120,722 (trihydroxycalciferol derivatives), US Patent No. 5,446,035 (20-methyl substituted vitamin D), US Patent No. 5,411,949 (23-oxa-derivatives), US Patent No. 5,237,110 (19-nor-vitamin D compounds), US Patent No. 4,857,518 (hydroxylated 24-homo-vitamin D derivatives). Additional Vitamin D analogs are taught in US Patent Nos. 4,804,502; 4,866,048; 5,145,846 5,374,629; 5,403,940; 5,446,034; and 5,447,924.<br>
US Patent No. 5,037,816 is directed to a method of treating psoriasis which comprises topically administering an effective amount of a vitamin D compound which is capable of stimulating the differentiation of cultured tumor cells or normal rodent or human fibroblasts or keratinocytes in vitro,<br>
US Patent No. 6,552,009 discloses a composition comprising a vitamin D analog and a derivative of retinoid useful in treating disorders characterized by abnormal cell-proliferation and/or cell-differentiation. In certain preferred embodiments the vitamin D analog is selected from calcitriol and Calcipotriol.<br>
US Patent Mo. 6,753,013 describes a pharmaceutical composition for dermal use comprising a combination of a vitamin D analog and a corticosteroid, the composition alleviating the inconvenience of a two-component regimen for the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases.<br>
Nicotinamide<br>
Nicotinamide (NA, niacinamide), a derivative of vitamin B3 and a precursor of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), displays multiple functions in cell<br>
metabolism. NA has been shown to induce the differentiation of insulin-producing cells (Otonkoski et al, 1993) and the protection of the pancreatic beta-cells from genotoxic agents (Pipeleers and Van de Winkel, 1986). US Patent No. 6,248,763 relates to specific topical compositions for treating skin conditions for example acne and psoriasis, which comprise 0.01%-1% methyl nicotinate, as the active ingredient.<br>
The synergistic effects of NA and vitamin D metabolites on differentiation and proliferation of human epidermal cells have recently been reported by some of the present inventors.<br>
International Patent Application Publications WO 01/51051 and WO 2004/006887 of some of the present inventors are directed to compositions and methods of treating a benign or malignant hyperproliferative epidermal pathology comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent selected from the group consisting of nicotinamide and/or cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (cADPR), and analogs thereof. The applications also disclose the combination of vitamin D3 metabolite (lα 25(OH2) D3) and NA and its synergistic effect on the differentiation and proliferation of human epidermal cells.<br>
Vitamin D3 and vitamin D3 analogs are known to possess anti-proliferative and prodifferentiating properties and are therefore effective in the treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders, for example psoriasis vulgaris. The synergistic effect of vitamin D3 with nicotinamide to further inhibit proliferation of keratinocytes has been demonstrated by some of the inventors of the present invention. Although a synergistic inhibitory effect of vitamin D3 and nicotinamide has been shown in keratinocytes in vitro, optimization of the two components in a pharmaceutical composition has never been shown.<br>
The art has neither taught nor suggested specific formulations consisting essentially of a vitamin D3 analog and a nicotinamide analog for the prevention, treatment or attenuation of disorders associated with hyperproliferative skin diseases.<br>
There remains a yet unmet medical need for compositions and methods useful in preventing and treating the symptoms associated with hyperproliferative disease, and in particular, psoriasis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions consisting essentially of a vitamin D3 analog and nicotinamide, and methods of use thereof for the treatment of hyperproliferative disease.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions, kits and methods, which can be used in the treatment skin disorders related to hyperproliferation of epidermal cells.<br>
As is described hereinabove, vitamin D3 and its analogs are known as useful agents in the treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases (Morimoto et al, 1986). Nicotinamide and its analogs have been shown to be effective hi inhibiting hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and in the induction of cell differentiation. The present invention provides dermal compositions consisting essentially of a vitamin D derivative, calcipotriol, and nicotinamide, which is highly efficacious in the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases and disorders.<br>
A composition combining calcipotriol and NA provides synergy in the form of additional benefit to the patient apart from the direct therapeutic value of the individual active substances.<br>
Satisfactory medical treatment of skin disorders, such as psoriasis, can be attained in a shorter period of time using the composition according to the invention. Furthermore the composition of the present invention does not contain steroids, thus obviating the side effects associated with that class of drugs.<br>
The composition of the present invention provides a safe, effective topical formulation for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and offers the following advantages over the commercially available calcipotriol compositions:<br>
a)	Dual anti-proliferative and differentiation-promoting effect on epidermal cells;<br>
b)	Synergetic therapeutic effect of the calcipotriol and nicotinamide, which<br>
intensifies the potential therapeutic effect of the composition for benign and malignant<br>
hyperproliferative disorders;<br>
c)	Anti-oxidative effect;<br>
d)	Non-toxic formulation approved for topical indications;<br>
e)	Calcipotriol in the present formulation does not penetrate the skin, thereby<br>
precluding systemic exposure to the drug and concomitant side effects;<br>
f)	The calcipotriol-nicotinic acid formulation of the invention was classified as a<br>
negligible irritant, whereas the commercially available products are labeled as irritants;<br>
g)	Avoidance of steroid and corticosteroid compounds and concomitant side effects.<br>
Definitions<br>
For convenience and clarity certain terms employed in the specification, examples and claims are described herein.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "effective amount" and "therapeutically effective amount" describes an amount of the agent that is sufficient to substantially abrogate, alleviate, inhibit, reduce or prevent the symptoms of hyperproliferative disease. Symptoms of psoriasis include one or more of dermatologjcal inflammation; red, flaky skin; rash; itching; plaques; blisters.<br>
According to the present invention, final concentrations of the calcipotriol typically range between 10 ug/g and 100 ug/g composition, preferably between about 20 µg/g and 70 ug/g. In specific compositions, calcipotriol is provided at a concentration of about 50 µg/g.<br>
In some embodiments a composition comprising a final concentration of about 10 ug/g to about 50 ug/g. calcipotriol is suitable for maintenance therapy of dermal hyperproliferative disease. In some embodiments a final concentration of about 15 µg/g to about 35 ug/g calcipotriol, preferably about 30 ug/g calcipotriol, is provided.<br>
The term "does not significantly penetrate the skin" refers to a composition comprising calcipotriol, wherein less than about 10% of the calcipotriol in the composition penetrates the skin cells, as determined for example, in a porcine ear skin cell assay. In some embodiments less than 5%, preferably less than 3% and more preferably less than 1% of the calcipotriol penetrates the skin. The adverse systemic affects of vitamin D3 are well known in the art and a composition, which precludes the penetration of calcipotriol into the skin cells, is highly desired.<br>
"Maintenance therapy" refers to treatment to either prevent the recurrence or relapse or to prevent the progression of symptoms associated with hyperproliferative disease. Nicotinamide (iiiacinamide) is one of the two principal forms of the B-complex vitamin 83 niacin. Some of the inventors of the present invention have identified NA as a inhibitor of cell proliferation, in particular of keratinocytes. According to the present invention, final concentrations of NA typically range between 0.1 mg/g and 25 mg/g composition, preferably between about 1 mg/g and 20 mg/g. In specific compositions NA is provided at a concentration of about 2 mg/g to about 10 mg/g and more preferably at a concentration of 2 mg/g to about 6.5 mg/g. A preferable concentration is 2.1 mg/g.<br>
Herein, the term 'treating" includes abrogating, substantially inhibiting, slowing or reversing the progression, substantially ameliorating clinical symptoms, or substantially preventing the appearance of symptoms associated with hyperproliferative disease. The term "treating" further is meant to include hydrating, healing or smoothing of the skin. The symptoms include but are not limited to growths, scaly skin, dry skin, rough skin, pustules and irritated skin. This treatment further includes prevention of these symptoms, and in particular scaly and irritated skin, before they occur.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "dermatologically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to the skin and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the applied active agent.<br>

It will be apparent to one skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains that many modifications, permutations, and variations may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
The in vitro and in vivo data that have provided the basis for the composition of the present example are as follows:<br>
Example 1: in vitro experiments<br>
Certain in vitro assays based on keratinocyte cell culture were performed to test NA and the combination of NA and calcipotriol. The experimental design has been described in PCT Patent Publication WO 01/51051, of some of the inventors of the present application.<br>
The results of the in vitro studies indicate that:<br>
Proliferation of all cell lines (HaCat keratinocytes, human primary keratinocytes, A431, KM12) was significantly inhibited by NA in pharmacological concentrations, in a dose dependent manner;<br>
A combination of NA with calcipotriol provides a synergetic antiproliferative effect;<br>
NA promotes the differentiation processes in benign and malignant epidermal cells as shown by increased expression of early (K10), late (Involucrin) and terminal (enveloped comified cell formation) differentiation markers;<br>
NA does not induce apoptotic death in HaCat and A431 cells; and<br>
Long-term treatment of HaCat keratinocytes with NA demonstrated a high level of protection to oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) and high levels of anti-oxidative enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and catalase).<br>
The experiments and their results are summarized herein below: Cell culture<br>
The antiproliferative activity of calcipotriol and nicotinamide was tested in two model systems: the first a spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte, which is referred to herein as "HaCat cells" or "HaCat keratinocytes", and serves as a model for highly proliferative epidermis, such as, but not limited to, psoriatic epidermis (Okenfels et al, 1998), and as a model for effects of external modulators of epidermal differentiation (Paramio, et al., 1997). The second system includes rapidly proliferating human keratinocytes, which are referred to herein as "cultured human epidermal keratinocytes", and serves as a model for detecting antiproliferative agents hi the treatment of psoriasis (Nikoloff,etal., 1988).<br>
These models have been used, according to the present invention, to test the antiproliferative efficacy of agents described herein. The immortalized human keratinocyte HaCat cells are routinely cultured in 75 cm2 flasks using Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM-EAGLE) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (PCS) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin 20 units/ml; streptomycin 20 ng/ml and nystatin 2.5 units/ml) at 37°C in 95% air/5% CO2. The medium is replaced every 5-4 days.<br>
Long-term cultures of HaCat cells grown with calcipotriol were obtained by cultivating HaCat cells, for 6 months, in routinely used medium.<br>
Other long-term cultures of cells with other agents are similarly obtained by cultivating HaCat cells, for a prolonged period of time, in medium supplemented with combinations of NA, vitamin D and derivatives thereof and vitamin A.<br>
Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (passages 3-6), obtained from normal face-lift surgery, were cultivated hi serum-free KGM®-2 BulletKit® (Clonetics, USA) medium with low calcium for accelerated proliferation of the keratinccytes.<br>
Reagents:<br>

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (USA).<br>
HaCftt cells were propagated in 25 cm2 or 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Coming, USA) and 24-well and 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning, USA) were used for incubation of the cells with different doses of NA (1-50 mM/I) and calcipotriol (1-10000 nM).<br>
Proliferation assays (MTT method)<br>
The viability and/or proliferation of HaCat cells and Cultured Human Epidermal Keratinocytes, following treatment with various concentrations of calcipotriol, nicotinamide (NA) or a combination thereof was determined by the MTT assay, according manufacturer in 96-well microtiter plates.<br>
Apoptosis and mitotic activity assays<br>
Estimation of apoptosis and necrosis was analyzed using fluorescence microscopy as previously described (Harel et al, 2002). Briefly, HaCat cells were cultured on glass slides and exposed to various concentration of NA (5,10,20 and 50 mM). After 72h the cells were stained with the DNA binding dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide. Viable cells were identified by intact nuclei and their blue fluorescence, necrotic cells by intact nuclei and red fluorescence, and cells in early or late phase of apoptosis, by fragmented nuclei and blue or red fluorescence. At. least one thousand cells were counted for each treatment.<br>
Determination of apoptosis and cell cycle parameters was performed by flow cytometry. Ceils were seeded in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks and cultured for 48 h, and then they were exposed to 5, 10 and 20 mM NA for 72 h. Row cytometry was performed on nuclei prepared with a datergent-trypsin method and stained with propidium iodide (Vindelov et al, 1983).<br>
Immunoblot analysis of PARP expression: immune complexes were detected by incubation with secondary anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody AP124A (dilution 1:5000) followed by developing with BCDP/NBT color substrate.<br>
Growth curve and mitotic activity: 2x104 cells per ml were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated without or with 10 mM NA. The cells were detached by trypsinization at different times (48h-168h) following passage and counted using a haemocytometer in tetra-aliquots. For estimation of mitotic activity the cells were cultured on glass coverslips into Petri dishes. After 72 h incubation with or without 10 mM NA the cells were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa stain and analyzed by light microscopy. Frequency of mitotic cells at different stages of mitotic cycle (pro-, meta-, ana- and telophases) was calculated. At least 1000 cells were counted for each experiment.<br>
Differentiation assays<br>
Cornified Envelope Formation: Late differentiation processes in HaCat cells treated with NA and or calcipotriol were measured by determining the cornified cell envelope formation, according to the procedures described in Sun and Green (1976) and PCT publication WO 01/51051.<br>
Indirect immunofhiorescence:<br>
Effects of NA and or calcipotriol on early (keratin klO expression) and late (involucrin expression) differentiation processes in HaCat cells were estimated by indirect immunofluorescence.<br>
In brief, 2 x 104 cells/ml were seeded on glass coverslips into Petri dishes with 0, 5, 10 and 20 mM NA or calcipotriol. After 72 hours of incubation, cells on the glass coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed by ice-cold mixture of methanol: acetone (1:1) and incubated at -20 °C for 10 minutes. Fixed cells were washed in PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS) for 10 minutes, to minimize non-specific absorption of the primary antibodies to the coverslips. Thereafter, the cells were incubated for 1 hour with primary monoclonal antibodies (Keratin 10 expression was detected by antihuman mouse monoclonal antibody, at 1/50 final dilution; Involucrin expression was detected by antihuman involucrin mouse monoclonal antibody at 1/100 final dilution), at 37 °C hour in a humidified chamber. Exhaustive, PBS-washed cells were incubated with fluorophor conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, at 1/50 final dilution, for 30 minutes at room temperature. The slides were viewed under a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop-2) equipped with<br>
epifluorescence optics and the appropriate filters to avoid cross-channel contamination. The level of keratin 10 and involucrin expression was estimated by counting the positive cells relative to the total cell number. On each slide, at least 500-1000 cells were scored.<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation of the mean (mean ± SD). Statistical significance (P
Results<br>
NA inhibited HaCat cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation for 72 h with low doses of NA (0.5-5 mM) did not change the rate of HaCat cell proliferation. However, higher concentrations of NA markedly reduced the proliferative response in dose-dependent manner. A pharmacological concentration of about 10 mM, resulting in two-fold inhibition of cell proliferation, was chosen for studying effect of NA on HaCat cell mitotic activity, growth curve and cell cycle progression. Microscopic analysis of mitotic activity indicated that percentage of mitotic cells was about 2.5 times lower in population of NA treated cells compared to untreated ones. Similar results of growth retardation were obtained after incubating HaCat cells with 10 mMNA for 48-168 hours.<br>
In order to elucidate the perturbation in cell cycle that can lead to growth retardation induced by NA treatment, frequency of cells in G0-G1, S and G2-M phases was studied by flow cytometry analysis. An inverse correlation between progression of the cells through G0-G1 phase of cell cycle and reduction of the cell number in S and G2-M-phases after incubation with NA for 72 h in dose dependent manner was shown.<br>
NA induces apoptosis, but not necrosis in HaCat cells. Using fluorescence microscopy, an estimate of apoptosis and necrosis could be made in a single sample. The levels of spontaneous apoptosis and necrosis in intact HaCat cells were 0.8±0.22% and 0.3±0.1%, respectively. Nicotinamide concentrations of 20 mM and 50 mM display significant apoptogenic effect in HaCat keratinocytes. At 50 mM of NA about 91 % of effected cells displayed signs of late apoptosis (red condensed and fragmented nuclei) and only 9% of the cells were in stage of early apoptosis (blue condensed and fragmented<br>
nuclei). However, no tested concentration of NA induced necrotic cell death. Thus, NA is a good candidate for the treatment of dermal disorders.<br>
Data on the Western blot analysis demonstrate that intact HaCat cells and the cells treated with 10 mM or 20 mM NA express a basal level of undegraded 116 kDa PARP full protein. However, an NA dose of 50 mM induced degradation of PARP and appearance of 85 kDa cleavage fragment of PARP. Terminal differentiation of keratinocytes was estimated by the level of comified envelope cell formation, which reflects protein-protein cross-linking reaction catalyzed by transglutaminase on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (Steinert and Marekov, 1997). The majority of untreated HaCat cells consisted of nonmaturated basal cells (58.6±10.24 %), while differentiated comified envelope cells constituted only 4.4±2.78% of total cell number. Incubation of the cells with 5 mM NA or 10 mM NA had no statistically significant effect on frequency of both basal and comified envelope cells. When concentrations of NA were increased to 15 mM, the level of basal cells was greatly reduced to 25.6±5.76%. At this concentration of NA comified envelope cell formation increased. Further reduction of basal cell number and elevation of envelope comified cell formation was found at 20 mM NA. At this concentration of NA the frequency of both basal and envelope comified cells was identical and equal about 15% of total cell population.<br>
To estimate differentiation-promoting processes foregoing the comified envelope cell formation, the level of keratin 10 (K10) and involucrin expression was determined. A concentration of 20 mM NA caused an increase in expression of keratin 10 and involucrin in HaCat keratinocytes. The quantitative analysis indicates that NA in concentrations from 5 mM to 10 mM had no effect on K10 expression compared to control cells. However, higher concentration of NA (20 mM) induced 3 -fold stimulation of K10 expression in HaCat cells. In contrast to K10, the involucrin expression was significantly more sensitive to NA treatment. The level of involucrin expression in HaCat cells treated with 5 mM NA was increased about 2 times (11.2±1.68% vs. 6.0±1.22% in control). The enhanced frequency of involucrin positive cells was found at 10 mM and 20 mM (11.0±1.13% and 15.1±3.93% respectively). These results show that NA treatment stimulates expression of various differentiation markers of HaCat cells in dose-dependent fashion.<br>
In conclusion, both the fact that pharmacological doses of NA are a safe therapy and above mentioned data on antiproliferative and differentiation promoting effect of this vitamin on human epidermal HaCat keratinocytes suggests a strong therapeutic potential of MA for treatment of different hyperproliferative skin disorders.<br>
Example 2: Formulation Development Strategy<br>
The formulation development strategy was based on the following principles: a) Formulations with wide diversity in composition; b) Use of pharmaceutical grade, approved ingredients;<br>
c)	Determine accelerated stability at 40°C and potency measured in the mouse-<br>
tail model, compared to commercially available compositions;<br>
d)	Optimization of the concentration of the active ingredients, based on activity<br>
measured by the mouse-tail model.<br>
Preparation of Ointment Formulations<br>
Eight distinct base formulations were prepared. Formulations 1-4 and 8 were a petroleum gel/mineral oil base; formulation 5 was a PEG base; formulation 6 was a triglyceride-water base; formulation 7 was a triglyceride-glycerin base. To the base formulations (numbered 1 to 8) 50 µg/g of calcipotriol and 0.61 mg/g of nicotinamide were added. About 300 gr of each formulation was prepared. These preparations were used for the analytical method development (extraction), accelerated stability at 40°C and biological activity assessment (potency).<br>

The filtrate was injected on HPLC.<br>
Results: Formulations 1,2 and 5 were found to be the most stable, after exposure to 40°C for 60 days (greater than 85% recovery of calcipotriol and NA). Formulation 5 remained the most stable even after 180-day exposure.<br>
Example 3: Potency Evaluation<br>
Potency evaluation assay were performed with formulations 1,2 and 5. The Potency evaluation was performed according to the procedure published in Bosman B., et al. (1992) with the following modifications:<br>
Collars were placed on the mice to prevent licking rather than mounting a tub on the treated area; and male albino mice (ICR) were used instead of male albino mice (NMRI) with same weight and age.<br>
Two experiments were performed: the first assay was carried out to test the relative potency of the different base compositions comprising 50 µg/g calcipotriol and 0.61 mg/g. Since formulas 1,2 and 5 were found to be the most stable, i.e. the active ingredients remain stable after 60 days at 400C. The results of this experiment are presented in Figures 1A (% orthokeratosis) and Figure IB (% activity of active ingredients). The letter "V" refers to the vehicle alone, and V-l; V-2 and V-5 refer to the vehicles of compositions 1, 2, and 5, respectively.. The numbers 1,2 and 5 refer to formulations 1,2 and 5 respectively.<br>
The second assay related to optimizing the nicotinamide concentrations in the compositions. Accordingly, six different compositions were screened for their potency, using a concentration of 50µg calcipotriol and 3-fold increasing nicotinamide concentrations starting with 0.70 mg/g formulation. These formulations were compared to a commercially available composition comprising 50 µg/g calcipotriol.<br>
The experimental outline is presented herein below in Table 1. The results of orthokeratosis are presented in Table 2 herein below.<br>
Table 1 (Table Removed)<br>
Table 2 (Table Removed)<br>
Figure 2A is a graph showing the levels of Orthokeratosis induced in mice tails by the various compositions of the invention. Specifically, optimization of the NA concentration in a composition comprising 50 µg/g Calcipotriol, was shown. Figure 2B shows the level of drug activity in the different formulations according to the present invention.<br>
Both graphs show that the compositions including 50 µg/g Calcipotriol and all tested concentrations of NA performed better than a commercially available (Daivonex) composition of 50 µg/g Calcipotriol. The best results were obtained by a composition of 50 µg/g Calcipotriol and 2.1 mg/g NA (II). Roman numerals I, II, II and IV refer to compositions of 50 µg/g Calcipotriol and either 0.7 mg/g (I); 2.1 mg/g (II); 6.3 mg/g (in) or 18.9 mg/g (IV) nicotinamide.<br>
Example 4; Formulations<br>
Method for preparing the drus? formulation<br>
Calcipotriol was dissolved in propylene glycol (PG). The 5% w/w Calcipotriol solution was mixed with 95% w/w PEG-based base formulation. Nicotinamide was added either to the Calcipotriol solution directly or together with Vitamin E to the melted mixture of PEG-4000 and Stearelh-20 in PEG-400 at precisely 45°C to reach a final concentration of 2.1 mg NA/g formulation.<br>
Table 3 shows a PEG-based base formulation of the invention. Table 3: Base Formulation<br>
(Table Removed)   Detailed methods of preparation<br>
One (1) mg calcipotriol was added to one ml of PG in a 40°C water bath with slight mixing until all calcipotriol dissolved and no crystals were observed. This solution is suitable for a 20 g preparation (final cone. 50ug/gr).<br>
PEG-4000 and Steareth-20 in PEG-400 were melted together in a water bath (~60°C) and mixed well to homogeneity. The mixture was cooled to below 50°C .<br>
Vitamin E and calcipotriol/PG was added to the PEG-4000 and Steareth-20 in PEG-400 mixture at a ratio of 5% w/w CP solution in PG with 95% w/w mixture.<br>
Alternatively, nicotinamide may be added with the Vitamin E: 42.0 mg NA for 20 g preparation (final cone. NA 2.1 mg/gr),or can be dissolved in the calcipotriol solution.<br>
The mixture was well blended and tubes were filled. Example 5: Synergistic effect of Calcipotriol and NA in vivo.<br>
The in vivo studies aimed to measure antipsoriatic activity (potency) of the compositions comprising NA and calcipotriol utilizing the standard mouse-tail test (see Example 3). The induction of a granular layer (orthokeratosis or normal maturation) in scale areas of mouse-tail skin and/or abnormal maturation (parakeratosis) is a relevant parameter for antipsoriatic activity.<br>
The test was performed large scale, with 100 measurements each for Placebo (PL), Calcipotriol (CP) 50µg/gr and a mixture pf Calcipotriol and Nicotinamide (CPNA). 90 measurements were obtained for Nicotinamide (NA) 2.1 mg/gr.<br>
All mice participating were randomized before evaluation and treatments were reassigned to data points only after microscopic analysis was complete in a fully blinded procedure.<br>
Treatments were analyzed using an ANOVA procedure for all treatments. Treatment with CP or NA alone provided good results but treatment with CPNA was significantly better, indicating a synergistic effect of CP and NA.<br>
The means and their standard deviations obtained are given below in Table 4: Table 4 (Table Removed)<br>
For single dose points per treatment it was possible to evaluate an estimate S of the synergistic effect by means of calculating a ratio of the results of the combined treatment to a sum of the separate treatments, where all treatments are adjusted by subtracting the placebo result from each of the separate results, as in the following equation: S = (CPNA -PL) / {[(CP - PL) + (NA - PL)}<br>
The value S was estimated to be 2.16 with an estimate of its standard error: 0.0211. It is therefore clear that synergism exists between CP and NA for the conditions of the performed test.<br>
Table 5 herein below shows the results of this evaluation.<br><br>
Tables (Table Removed)<br>
Figure 3 is a graph that depicts the results of the above analysis. The synergistic effect of calcipotriol and nicotinamide at the above-mentioned concentrations is evident (Combined, (CP+NA)).<br>
Example 6: Acute Dermal Irritation/Corrosion in Rabbits<br>
This study was conducted to comply with: OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (as revised in 1997); OECD Environmental Health and Safety Publications Series on Principles of Good Laboratory Practice and Compliance Monitoring - Number 1. ENV/MC/CHEM (98) 17; OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals, Section 4, No. 404, "Acute Dermal Irritation/Corrosion", adopted April 24, 2002; and ISO 10993-10:2002 (E) Second Edition 01 September 2002, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices-Part 10: Tests for Irritation and Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity. Section 6.3 Animal Skin Irritation Test.<br>
Objective: Assessment of the potential of the Test Items to produce dermal irritation/corrosion by single dose application to the rabbit, thereby providing information on possible health hazards likely to arise from exposure of the skin to the test substance under conditions of its projected use as a therapeutic agent for Psoriasis.<br>
Test material: Calcipotriol + nicotinamide (NA) hi the following concentrations: 50 microgram/gram calcipotriol, 2.1 milligram/gram NA in an PEG base.<br>
Test system: Rabbit/ New Zealand White (NZW) Female, about 3-4 months old, about 2 kg at study commencement. The animals are acclimated for at least 5 days. A<br>
veterinarian examined the health status of the animals used in this study on arrival. Only animals in good health are acclimatized to laboratory conditions and used in the study.<br>
Housing: Rabbits were housed individually hi stainless steel cages mounted in batteries. The cages measured 60 (L) x 50 (W) x 45 (H) cm plus a shelf sized about 50 (L) x 20 (W) cm placed about 20cm above the cage floor. Rabbits were fitted with perforated plastic floors over under trays.<br>
Food and Water: Animals were provided with approximately 100 g/rabbit/day commercial rabbit diet and allowed free access to drinking water, supplied to each cage via polyethylene bottles with stainless steel sipper tubes. The water was filtered (O.lu filter), chlorinated and acidified and is monitored for contaminants twice yearly.<br>
Environment: Automatically controlled environmental conditions were set to maintain temperature at 17-23°C with a relative humidity (RH) of 30-70%, a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle and 15-30 air changes/hr in the study room. Temperature and RH were monitored daily. The light cycle was monitored by the control computer.<br>
Identification: Animals were identified by the breeder by a tattoo or by a marking dye ear number. This number also appears on a cage card, visible on the front of each cage. The cage card additionally contained the study number and relevant details as to treatment group and dose level.<br>
Termination: Rabbits were euthanized by an IV overdose of Na-Pentobarbital (75 mg/kg), at any time that an animal shows continuing signs of severe pain or distress or in case where histopathological examination is required to clarify equivocal responses.<br>
Justification: The albino rabbit was selected for this study, as it is the species of choice specified by the OECD and EPA Guidelines for use in dermal hritation/corrosion testing.<br>
Dose: 0.5s/ animal Test procedures:<br>
Principles of the Test: The sequential method applied in mis study represents a stepwise procedure aimed to avoid the unnecessary use of animals. The test was performed<br>
initially using one animal. Depending upon the results, a confirmatory test using additional animals was performed. The Test Item was applied in a single dose to the skin of the test animal. Adjacent areas of untreated skin of each animal served as a control. The degree of irritation/corrosion is evaluated and scored at specific intervals.<br>
Pre-Test Preparations of Animals: Approximately 24 hours before the test, the fur was removed by close-clipping the dorsal area of the trunk of the animals using an electric clipper. Care was taken to avoid abrading the skin and only animals with healthy intact skin are used In case areas of dense hair growth was observed, those are not used as test sites.<br>
Application of the Test Item: The Test Item was applied either directly to the skin, or to a gauze patch (approximately 6cm2), which was then applied immediately and directly to the skin. The patch was held in contact with the skin with a non-irritating tape and a suitable semi-occlusive dressing (TUBIGRIP stockinet) to retain the gauze patch and the Test Item throughout the 4-hour exposure period and to ensure that the animal cannot ingest the Test Item. The untreated skin area of each animal serves as control. Test Item was applied sequentially as follows:<br>
Initial Test: A single patch was applied to one animal for 4 hours. (If dermal corrosion would have been noted, the study would have immediately been terminated).<br>
Confirmatory Test: Was not necessary. If an irritant effect would have been observed in the initial test, the confirmatory test would have been conducted in a sequential manner or by exposure of two additional animals simultaneously. Exposure Periods and<br>
Removal of Patches: At the end of the 4-hour exposure period, residual Test Item was removed using tap water or an appropriate solvent without altering the existing response or the integrity of the epidermis. The margins of the test site were marked with non-irritating and non-erasable ink in order to facilitate the subsequent observation sessions.<br>
Analgesia: An opioid analgesic may be used on a case-by-case basis in view of animal welfare considerations for the use of laboratory animals in research.<br>
Observations:<br>
Observation Period: The duration of the observation period should be sufficient to evaluate fully the magnitude and reversibility of the effects observed. However, the experiment would have been terminated at any time that the animal shows continuing signs of severe pain or distress. Animals that do not develop skin lesions are observed for a period of 72 hours following removal of the patches. Further observations may be needed to establish reversibility up to 14 days post application. In case of extended observation period beyond 72 hrs, each animal is observed until reversibility is seen, or up to a maximum of 14 days.<br>
Clinical Observations and Grading of Skin Reactions: All animals were examined for signs of erythema and edema, and the responses are scored at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours after patch removal. For the initial test in one animal, the test site was also examined immediately after the patch has been removed. If animals were observed for up to 14 days, further examinations are performed once daily following removal of patch in order to determine the status of the lesions, and their reversibility. The grades of skin reactions were recorded at each examination.<br>
Any dermal reactions other than those listed (e.g. limited area alopecia, hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia and scaling) were recorded separately and scored (although not calculated in the Primary Irritation Index) according to a 4-point grading scale, in ascending order of severity (0=none; l=mild; 2=moderate, 3=severe).<br>
In addition, examination of any systemic adverse effects was carried out at least once daily or more frequently when indicated by the response of the animals to treatment.<br>
Humane Endpoints: Animals found in a moribund condition and animals showing severe pain and enduring signs of severe distress were to be humanely killed.<br>
Body Weights: Determination of individual body weights was made before Test Item application and at study termination. For animals observed up to 14 days, further body weight determinations were performed at 7 and 14 days following patch removal.<br>
Pathology; At the discretion of the study director and pending the reactions observed, histopathological examination may be carried out to clarify doubtful reactions.<br>
Data Evaluation: Primary Irritation Index (PII): Final evaluation of the Test Item's potential irritation effects was based on determination of the Primary Irritation Index (PII) (c) according to the computational steps shown below. Only the 24,48 and 72 hr observation scores were used for calculating the PII. Any observations made prior to application or after 72 hr intended for monitoring recovery, were not used in the determination.<br>
For each animal, the Irritation Scores for both erythema and edema were calculated to obtain the Primary Irritation Index (PII).<br>
(Table Removed) When responses such as alopecia (limited area), hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia and scaling persist to the end of the observation period, the Test Item would be considered an irritant.<br>
Definitions (according to EPA and OEDC guidelines):<br>
Dermal irritation is the production of reversibility inflammatory changes or any damage in the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours.<br>
Dermal corrosion is the production of irreversibility tissue damage in the skin following the application of a test substance (namely, visible necrosis through the epidermis and into the dermis, following the application of a test substance for up to four hours. Corrosive reactions are typified by ulcers, bleeding, bloody scabs, and, by the end of observation at 14 days, by discoloration due to blanching of the skin, complete areas of alopecia, and scars).<br>
Results: Dermal reaction consisted solely of erythema, with an incidence of 2 out of the 3 animals tested. Onset of erythema was either immediately- or at 1 hour after patch removal. In one animal erythema was graded 2 (well defined) in the immediate time after patch removal but thereafter subsided to 1 (very slight); in another animal erythema was graded 1. Recovery was noted in the former at 72-hrs after patch removal, and in the latter at 24 hr observation point.<br>
No noticeable systemic clinical signs in reaction to treatment were evident hi any of the animals throughout the entire study period.<br>
No unusual changes in body weights were noted.<br>
Conclusion: In consideration of a calculated Primary Irritation Index (PIT) the irritant level of the composition of the present invention is considered to be a "Negligible" dermal irritant. This result indicates that the combination of CP and NA provides a formulation with less dermal irritation than the formulation consisting of CP alone.<br>
In contrast, Daivonex® cream (Leo) is accompanied with a Data Sheet showing a level of 31.8% of adverse events in patients. These adverse advents include inter alia lesional and perilesional irritation (13.9%) and face and/or scalp irritation (10.6%).<br>
Example 7: Skin Permeation of Calcipotriol and Nicotinamide from Three Topical Formulations: NA. CP and CP-NA combination<br>
The objective of the present study was to measure the skin permeation behavior of Calcipotriol and Nicotinamide from three topical formulations: a composition with NA alone, a composition with Calcipotriol alone and a composition with NA and Calcipotriol.<br>
Pharmacokinetic survey<br>
Calcipotriol: Calcipotriol is typically marketed at the concentration of 0.005% as a lotion, cream, gel, ointment or scalp solution. The weekly dose is limited to lOOg per week of cream or ointment or 60ml per week of scalp solution in order to prevent transient skin irritation and hypercalcaemia.<br>
Nicotinamide: Nicotinamide (NA) is a water-soluble amide of nicotinic acid and is one of two principal forms of the B-complex vitamin, B3. The pharmacokinetics of NA<br>
depends on dose, species, gender, and route of administration. Topical 4% nicotinamide gel was found of comparable efficacy to 1% clindamycin gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris (Shalita,etall995).<br>
Formulations and Methods<br>
Three formulations were prepared. The first comprised Nicotinamide (NA, 2.1 mg/g), the second Calcipotriol (CP, SOµg/g) and the third, a combination of Calcipotriol (50µg/g) and Nicotinamide (2.1 mg/gXCPNA).<br>
Skin permeation measurements<br>
The Franz cell assembly and porcine ear skin are used for measuring permeation of drugs through the skin in vitro from various systems and dosage forms (Dick et al. 1992; Simon, et el. 2000; Touitou et al. 1998; Chien 1992). The experiments were carried out in vitro using the Franz diffusion cell assembly and full-thickness skin from porcine ear. The diffusion cells are made from an inert material and the assembly allows for good receiver-fluid mixture and temperature control.<br>
Porcine ear skin was excised from the outer part of the ear and separated from the underlying cartilage. The skin was stored frozen at -20°C until use, always less than one week. Just prior to an experiment, the skin was thawed at room temperature for 1 hour and the hair was clipped. The skin was checked for integrity, then cut and mounted on the diffusion cells with the stratum corneum towards the donor compartment. A quantity of 100 mg test formulation was placed on 1.77 cm2 skin in the donor compartment. The receiver compartment was filled with ethanol:water (3:7) in order to keep pseudo-sink conditions in the system. The receivers were kept at 37°C and stirred to ensure homogeneous medium during the experiment.<br>
The experiments were run non-occluded for 12 hours. Samples were withdrawn from the receiver at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 12 hours. The samples were analyzed for Nicotinamide and Calcipotriol concentrations by HPLC as further described. The experiments were carried out in triplicates. A total of 24 cells were used, 8 cells for each formulation tested (NA, CP and CPNA).<br>
As for topical products, finite-dose procedures were used. The donor was left open to atmospheric conditions; this mimics the clinical use situation.<br>
Methods<br>
Each formulation was tested on eight skin pieces. A total of 24 pieces were used.<br>
HPLC assays: The HPLC assays of nicotinamide and calcipotricl were carried as follows: Nicotinamide was analyzed in a Waters Alliance 2795 LC and Quattro micro™ HPL ehromotograph LC-MS system with Hypersil BDS C18, 3 urn, 150 x 2.1 mm (CN 28103-152130, batch # 4796) column. The assay was carried out with a mobile phase composed of 0.1% TFA in water: acetonitrile (9:1) at flow of 0.23 mL/min.<br>
Calcipotriol was assayed on TSP HPL chromatograph equipped UV detector with 5 cm flow cell HPLC system at 266 nm. The separation was carried out using Hypersil ODS 2, 5 urn, 250 x 4.6 mm column (CN 31605-020, batch # 5/120/5745) with a mobile phase containing water acetonitrile (4:6) at flow of 1.8 mL/min.<br>
Nicotinamide and Calcipotriol hydroethanolic solutions were used for calibration curves and as external standards.<br>
Results<br>
The skin permeation results are given as:<br>
1.	Qr- Quantity of the permeant molecule in the receiver at each time point of the<br>
experiment (Mean± SD).<br>
2.	Qr12- Amount of the permeant molecule that permeated the skin during the 12<br>
hours and accumulated in the receiver (Mean ± SD).<br>
3.	Skin permeation profiles- Cumulative drug quantities permeated the skin vs.<br>
time.<br>
Permeation of Calcipotriol from the formulations CP and CPNA<br>
No Calcipotriol was detected by the HPLC assay in the receiver compartment of any cell during the 12-hours permeation experiment. The lower quantization level (QL) of<br>
calcipotriol in ethanol-water solution was found to be 1.3ng/mL. Thus, calcipotriol in the present formulation does not penetrate the skin.<br>
Without wishing to be bound to theory, the lack of calcipotriol penetration into the skin poses several advantages of the present formulation including<br>
a)	a higher level of safety due to the elimination of systemic side effects, such as .<br>
hypercalcemia often seen in patients using commercially available calcipotriol; and<br>
b)	high level of efficacy since the calcipotriol remains on the skin surface in contact<br>
with its target cells, the keratinocytes.<br>
Permeation of nicotinamide from the formulations -NA and CPN4<br>
The quantities (Qr) of nicotinamide that permeated the skin from the formulations NA and CPNA are summarized in Table 6.<br>

Example 8: Clinical Trial phase I/JIa: Non-steroidal Novel Treatment for Moderate Psoriasis<br>
The active substance: "CPNA formulation": 0.05% Calcipotriol and 0.21% Nicotinamide in a base of 0.3% vitamin E; 2% Steareth 20; 77.7% PEG-400 and 20% PEG-4000.<br>
Methodology: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo and active controlled comparative study<br>
Main objectives: The primary objectives of this study were a) to assess safety and efficacy of topical application of the CPNA formulation administered twice a day for 8 weeks in patients with moderate Psoriasis; and b) determine that the CPNA formulation is non-inferior to competitor Daivonex® (Leo).<br>
Secondary objectives'. The secondary objectives of mis study are: a) PGA (Physician's Global Assessment) score follow-up; b) PSA (Patient Self Assessment) Score follow-up; c) post treatment lasting effect; d) CPNA formulation treatment has no rebound effect as is common for certain psoriasis treatments, especially steroid based compositions. PGA score (Gottlieb et al, 2003): At the screening visit, the inclusion visit (VI) and at all the following visits, evaluation of psoriasis will be performed using the PGA score. The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) has the investigator assign a single estimate of the patient's overall severity of disease. A seven-point scale from clear to severe was used, which is depicted in Table 7.<br>
Table 7:  PGA Scoring  (Table Removed)<br>
PASI score (Feldman and Krueger, 2005): At Screening visit, inclusion visit (V1) and at all the following visits, evaluation of psoriasis will be performed using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI).<br>
Symptom score: Erythema (E), Induration (I) and Scaling (S) will be scored using the scale shown in table 8, hereinbelow.<br>
Table 8:  Symptom scores <br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
% Area Score: An area score will be attributed to each body area as shown in table 9: <br>
Table 9: Symptom score <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
PASI SCORE = 0.1 [(E + 1 + S) x Area Score]Head + 0.2 [(E + 1 + S) x Area Score]Upper Limbs + 0.3 [(E + I + S) x Area Score]Trunk + 0.4 [(E + I + S) x Area Score]Lower Limbs<br>
Patient Self-Assessment: The patient was required to generally assess tolerance treatment effect and at the two weeks visits (V2) and at all the following visits, by general scoring (of the efficacy and tolerance). In addition, at the inclusion visit (V1), the patient used the same efficacy score to describe disease status at the beginning of the trial.
