COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
  "COMPOUND OF GENERAL FORMULA (A)"<br>
UCB FARCHIM S.A.  [AG-LTD], of Z.I.  Planchy,   10 Chemin de Croix <br>
Blanche, C.P. 411, CH-1630 Bulle, Switzerland,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly  describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention concerns 2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine derivatives and a process for preparing<br>
them and their uses. The invention also concerns a process for preparing<br>
•i<br>
a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide derivatives from unsaturated 2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine derivatives.<br>
Particularly the invention concerns novel intermediates and their use in methods for the preparation of (S)-(-)-a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide, which is referred under the International Nonproprietary Name of Levetiracetam, its dextrorotatory enantiomer and related ip      compounds. Levetiracetam is shown as having the following structure:<br><br><br><br>
N'      ° Nri<br>
O<br>
Levetiracetam <br>
Levetiracetam, a laevorotary compound is disclosed as a protective agent for the treatment and the prevention of hypoxic and ischemic type aggressions of the central nervous system in the European patent No. 162036. This compound is also effective in the treatment of epilepsy, a   therapeutic indication for which it has been demonstrated that its dextrorotatory enantiomer (R)-(+)-a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide completely lacks activity (A.J. GOWER et aL, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 222, (1992), 193-203). Finally, in the European patent application No. 0 645 139 this compound has been disclosed for its anxiolytic activity.<br>
The asymmetric carbon atom carries a hydrogen atom (not shown) positioned above the 4o      plane of the paper. The preparation of Levetiracetam has been described in the European<br>
patent No. 0162 036 and in the British patent No. 2 225 322, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The preparation of the dextrorotatory enantiomer (R)-(+)-a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide has been described in the European patent    No. 0165 919. Nevertheless, these approaches do not fully satisfy the requirements for an industrial process. Therefore, a new approach has been developed via the asymmetric hydrogenation of new precursors.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a compound having the general formula (A) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br><br><br><br><br>

In another aspect the invention concerns the use of compounds of formula (A) as synthesis intermediates.<br>
The compound of formula (A) where X is -CONH2 is of particular interest, as catalytic hydrogenation of this compound leads directly to Levetiracetam. Both the Z (Zusammen) and E (Entgegen) isomers of these compounds have been shown to undergo rapid and selective asymmetric hydrogenation to either enantiomer of the desired product. The representation of the bond joining the group R1 to the molecule denotes either a Z isomer or an E isomer<br>

related ailments. According to another embodiment, the invention therefore concerns a process for preparing a compound having a formula (B)<br>
,4<br>
(B)<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and X are as noted above, via catalytic assymetric hydrogenation of <br>
the corresponding compound having the formula (A) as illustrated and defined above.  Catalytic<br>
hydrogenation is described in many publications or books such as "Synthese et catalyse<br>
asymetriques - auxiliaires et ligands chiraux" Jacqueline Seyden-Penne (1994) - Savoirs<br>
actuel, interEdition/CNRS Edition - CH 7.1 "hydrogenation catalytique" page 287-300.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, references herein to the compounds of general formula (B) 2D     either individually or collectively are intended to include geometrical isomers i.e. both Z<br>
(Zusammen) and E (Entgegen) isomers as well as enantiomers, diastereoisomers and mixtures<br>
of each of these (racemates).<br>
Preferably, the process of the invention concerns the preparation of compounds of<br>
formula (B) in which R2and R4 are hydrogen and X is -COOH or -COOMe or -COOEt or -2]5      CONH2and R1 is methyl particularly those wherein R3 is hydrogen, alkyl (especially propyl) or<br>
haloalkenyl (especially difluorovinyl). Best results have been obtained with the process for<br>
preparing levetiracetam, compoung of formula (B) in which R* is methyl, R2and R4 are<br>
hydrogen, R3 hydrogen, propyl or difluorovinyl and X is -CONH2 •<br>
Generally, this process comprises subjecting to catalytic hydrogenation a compound of     formula (A) as described above. Preferably the compound of formula (A) is subjected to<br><br>
symmetric hydrogenation using a chiral catalyst based on a rhodium (Rh) or ruthenium (Ru)-chelate. Asymmetric hydrogenation methods are described in many publications or books such as "Asymmetric Synthesis" R.A Aitken and S.N. Kilenyi (1992)- Blackie Academic &amp; Professional or "Synthesis of Optically active -Amino Acids" Robert M. Willimas (1989) - Pergamon Press.<br>
Rh(I)-, and Ru(II)-, complexes of chiral chelating ligands, generally diphosphines, have great success in the asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins. Many chiral bidentate ligands, such as diphosphinites, bis(aminophosphine) and aminophosphine phosphinites, or chiral catalyst complexes, are described in the literature or are commercially available. The chiral catalyst<br>
  may also be associated to a counterion and/or an olefin.<br>
Although much information on the catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of the chiral catalysts has been accumulated, the choice of the ligands, the chiral catalysts and reaction conditions still has to be made empirically for each individual substrate. Generally the Rh(I) based systems are mostly used for the preparation of amino acid derivatives, while the Ru(II)<br>
 catalysts give good to excellent results with a much broader group of olefmic substrates.<br>
 Chiral catalyst chelators which may be used in the present invention, are DUPHOS, BPPM, BICP. BINAP, DIPAMP, SKEWPHOS, BPPFA. DIOP, NORPHOS, PROPHOS, PENNPHOS, QUPHOS, BPPMC, BPPFA. In addition to this, supported or otherwise immobilised catalysts prepared from the above chelators may also be used in the present invention in order to give<br>
either improved conversion or selectivity, in addition to improved catalyst recovery and recycling. Preferred chiral catalyst chelators for use in the method of this invention are selected from DUPHOS or Methyl, Diethyl, Diisopropyl-DUPHOS<br>
(l,2-bis-(2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene - US patent N° 5,171,892), DIPAMP (Phosphine, 1,2-   ethanediylbis ((2-methoxyphenyl)phenyl - US patents N° 4,008,281 and No 4,142,992),<br>

Preferred solvents for use in the method of this invention are selected from,<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol, methanol, dichloromethane PCM),<br>

	   The counterion is selected from halide (halogen(-)), BPh4(-) C104(-). BF4(-), PF6(-),<br>

	The olefin is selected from ethylene, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, cyclohexadiene,<br>
norbomadiene or cycloocta-l,5-diene (COD).<br>
	Using these chiral catalysts, in combination with a range of counter-ions and at<br>
catalyst-substrate ratios ranging from 1:20 to 1:20,000 in a range of commercially available solvents it is possible to convert compounds of formula (A) into laevorotary or dextrorotary enantiomers of compounds of formula (B) having high % of enantiomeric excess (e.e.) and in excellent yield, and high purity. Moreover, this approach will use standard industrial plant lp      and equipment and have cost advantages.<br>
This asymmetric synthesis process will also be lower cost due to the avoidance of recycling or discarding the unwanted enantiomer obtained by a conventional synthesis process.<br>
Best results have been obtained with the process for preparing    (R)-α-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide or (R)-a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidineacetamide , wherein it comprises subjecting a compound of formula A' in the form of a Z isomer or an E isomer to asymmetric hydrogenation using a chiral catalyst according to the following scheme.<br>

         As will be appreciated by the skilled person, depending on the substitution pattern, not all compounds of general formula (A) and (B) will be capable of forming salts so  that reference to "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" applies only to such compounds of general formulae (A) or (B) having this capability.<br>

The esterification of the ketobutyric acid was carried out either with methanol following a literature method, or with diazomethane. The subsequent condensation reaction gave precursor A2 in 60% yield. This method leads to a higher content of E-isomer in comparison to the route via precursor Al (Scheme 8). Both routes allow for the preparation of other ester derivatives of precursor A2.<br><br>
 Example 4 <br>
Synthesis of the precursor A3 has been effected by reacting the enamide acid with PCI5 to give the acid chloride and then with gaseous ammonia to obtain the desired enamide amide id     A3. The product has been confirmed as the Z-isomer.<br>
The crude enamide amide A3 was isolated from the reaction mixture by dissolving it in THF-MeOH and filtering to remove inorganic residues. After evaporation of the solvent a yellow solid was obtained. The crude material was purified by dry flash chromatography followed by recrystallisation from i-PrOH to afford pure material. This procedure has been successfully .       applied to produce a single batch of A3 (118 g, 54%, &gt;99% by peak area) and is outlined in Scheme 12.<br><br><br><br>

	In most cases of the asymmetric hydrogenation of precursors, the catalyst has been<br>
prepared in situ by reacting [Rh(COD)2l+OTf- and the respective chiral ligand in the solvent of choice followed by addition of substrate. Some catalysts are commercially available and these have been used without further purification.<br>
	Example 5<br>
Results from the asymmetric hydrogenation of precursors Al and A2 using a number of rhodium based catalyst systems are summarised in the following Table 1. These reactions have been performed with between 0.005 mol % and 5 mol % of catalyst and 100 mg or 200 mg of substrate at ambient temperature (room temperature : rt) for 24 hours. Reaction conditions<br>
      such as the H2 pressure, the kind of solvents, the amount of precursor have been modified in order to obtain the optimal conditions. All products have been isolated by evaporation of the<br>
16<br><br>
solvent from the reaction mixture and analysed without further purification by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) method for % e.e. determination of the hydrogenation product of precursor Al proved difficult to develop. Therefore, we  converted the crude products into their methyl esters using diazomethane in THF solution. The ester derivatives were then analysed using a chiral HPLC method for monitoring the hydrogenation of enamide ester A2. For the HPLC method, we used a Chiracel OD 4.6 x250 mm column and IPA/n-hexane (95:05) as eluant.<br>
For the hydrogenated product of precursor A2, the e.e. results have been obtained by lb      the following chiral HPLC method: Chiralcel OD 4.6 x 250 mm, IPA-Hexane (5:95 v/v), 205 nm, 1 ml/min at ambient temperature (rt), sample 1 mg/ml, 13 min ( S-enantiomer), 16 min (R-enantiomer). Initially, the screening was carried out on 100 mg scale with 5 mol % of catalyst.<br>
The results in % of enantiomeric excess (e.e.) are positive to express the percentage of      laevorotatory S-enantiomer and negative to express the percentage of dextrorotatory R-enantiomer.<br>

	• -Example 7 :    Asymmetric hydrogenation of precursor A3 with Rh-(Et,Et)-DUPHOS.<br>
The results of the hydrogenation of A3 with Rh-DUPHOS catalyst are shown in Table 3. These reactions have been performed in the same way as in example 5 and 6, with a hydrogen pressure of 4 atmospheres.<br>
Usually, enantioselectivities in the Rh-DUPHOS catalysed hydrogenations of<br>
a-acylaminoacrylic acid derivatives show very little solvent effect. However, it remains<br>
impossible to predict a priori what the effect of the solvent would be on the enantioselectivity and the rate of the reaction for a given substrate. It has been observed that the hydrogenation of A3 is highly solvent dependant. The non-coordinating, aprotic solvent DCM was found superior. Hydrogenations in protic alcoholic solvents resulted in slower reactions and reduced<br>
         selectivity. Similarly, reduced conversions were observed in polar aprotic solvents such as EtOAc and THF, both of which may be expected to coordinate to the metal and inhibit catalysis. The inhibition by coordinating solvents probably suggests that A3 is a poorly coordinating substrate, especially in comparison to other α-acylaminoacrylic acid derivatives. Nevertheless, excellent results have been obtained in DCM. As can be seen,<br>
         enantioselectivities of 97 to 98% e.e. were consistently achieved on 0.5 to 15 g scale in this<br>
solvent. Other promising results were obtained in EtOAc-DCM solvent mixture and in toluene.<br>

Preparation of precursor A2 : Methyl (Z3-2-(2-oxotetrahydro-lH-l-pyrrolyl)-2-butenoate (Precursor A2)<br>
Precursor Al (12 g. 71 mmol) was dissolved in THF (240 ml, 20 vol) at 0-5°C. A solution of diazomethane in ether (200 ml, -78 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added portionwise to the ^      reaction mixture, keeping the temperature below 5°C. The reaction mixture turned yellow colour with the last portion of the reagent. This was stirred for additional 30 min at low temperature and then allowed to warm up. The remaining traces of diazomethane were destroyed by dropwise addition of very dilute acetic acid in THF until the yellow solution became colourless. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the crude material lb      was distilled (93 - 94°C, 0.01 mm Hg) to afford pure product (9.44 g. 73%) as a colourless oil, which solidifies on cooling below 10 °C.<br>

The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 18 hrs under an inert atmosphere. Then it was allowed to cool down, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.

After cooling down the solution was washed with 10% aq KHSO4 (2 x 3 vol). The aqueous phase was saturated with NaCl and back extracted with toluene (1x6 vol). The combined organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford crude material (7.5 g) as an orange mobile oil. The crude oil was distilled (92 - 94 °C, 0.1 mm Hg) and gave pure product (4.7 g, 60%) as a colourless oil. Z:E ratio 6:1 by lH NMR.<br>

dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 150 mg, 1.23 mmol) under an nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
        reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C before adding dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 2.46 g,<br>
11.9	mmol), then heated to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously<br>
21 hours. After that hexane (40 ml) was added to precipitate a solid. The precipitate was<br>
filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford 3.03 g of colourless liquid oil.<br>
The oil in water (40 ml) was washed with dichloromethane (DCM, 40 ml then 2 x 20 ml), the<br>
         solvent was dried by Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo to afford 2 g of E-A2 ethyl ester (100% yield).<br>
F.	Preparation of precursor A3 : (Z)-2-(2-oxotetrahydro-lH-l-pyrrolyl)-2-butenenamide<br>
(Precursor A3).<br>
	A 20-litre flange flask was set up for stirring under inert atmosphere and was charged<br><br>
with Al (222 g, 1.313 mol, 1 wt) and anhydrous THF (7.0 litres, 30 vol). The reaction mixture was allowed to cool below 5°C and PCI5 (300 g, 1.44 mol, 1.1 equiv) was added portionwise keeping the reaction temperature below 10°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at -5 to 0°C for one hour, allowed to warm up to 15°C to dissolve the remaining PCI5, and then cooled back 0     below 0°C. A condenser filled with dry ice/acetone was fitted and ammonia gas {- 200 g) was bubbled slowly through the solution, keeping temperature below 15°C. The suspension was stirred for an additional 15 min and the excess ammonia was removed by bubbling nitrogen gas through for several minutes. Methanol (3.7 litre, 17 vol) was added, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 1.5 hrs, then cooled below 30°C, filtered, and washed with THF/MeOH (2:1, 5     600 ml, -3 vol). The filtrate was evaporated to give a yellow solid.
