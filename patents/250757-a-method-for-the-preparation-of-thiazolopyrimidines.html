				<td>METHODS<br>
The present invention relates to methods for preparing thiazolopyrimidine compounds, intermediate compounds used in such methods, thiazolopyrimidme compounds so prepared and their use in therapy.<br>
In our published PCT patent application WO-01/25242 we describe pharmaceutically active compounds of the general formula I<br>
NR2R3<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, and methods for their preparation. Such methods include treatment of a compound of formula<br>
L<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
where L is a leaving group such as chlorine, with an amine HNR2R3.<br>
We have now devised an advantageous process for preparing compounds of the formula I. This novel process involves protection of the thiazole nitrogen atom and gives an improved yield of final product when compared with the prior art method described in WO-01/25242. By way of example for a compound of the above formula we have achieved displacement of a chlorine leaving group by a group NR2R3 and subsequent conversion of the 2-amino group to a carbonyl group, with about 40% overall yield. In contrast we have achieved about 70% overall yield for the same product starting from a compound of formula IV as set out hereinafter and wherein the leaving group L is chlorine.<br>
Therefore in a first aspect of the invention we provide a method for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or sob/ate thereof:<br>
NR2R3<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which<br>
R1 represents a Ca-C? carbocyclic, Ci-C8 alkyl, Ca-Ce alkenyl or C2-Cg alkynyl group, each of the groups being optionally substituted by one or more substituent groups independently selected from halogen atoms, -OR4, -NR5R6, -CONR5R6, -COOR7, -NR8COR9, -SR10, -SOaR10, -SOzNRV, -NR8SO2R9 or an aryl or heteroaryl group, both of which may be optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen atoms, cyano, nitro, -OR4, -NR5R6, -CONRV, -COOR7, -NR8COR9, -SR10, -6, -NR8SOaR9, Ci-Cg alkyl or trifluoromethyl groups;<br>
R2 and R3 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, or a C3-C7 carbocyclic,<br>
Ci-Cg alkyl, Ca-Q alkenyl or Ca-Ce alkynyl group, the latter four groups may be optionally<br>
substituted by one or more substituent groups independently selected from;<br>
(a)	halogen atoms, -OR4, -NRV, -CONR^6, -COOR7, -NR8COR9, -SR10, -SOzR10,<br>
-SO2NR5R6, -NR8SO2R9;<br>
(b)	a 3-8 membered ring optionally containing one or more atoms selected from O, S, NR8<br>
and itself optionally substituted by Ci-Ca-alkyl or halogen; or<br>
(c)	an aryl group or heteroaryl group each of which may be optionally substituted by one<br>
or more substituents independently selected from halogen atoms, cyano, nitro, -OR4, -NR^R6,<br>
-CONR5R6, -NR8COR9, -SOaNR^6, -NR8SO2R9, Ci-Q alkyl and trifluoromethyl groups;<br>
R4 represents hydrogen, Ci-Cg alkyl or a phenyl group the latter two of which may be<br>
optionally substituted by one or more substituent groups independently selected from halogen<br>
atoms, phenyl, -OR11 and -NR12R13.<br>
R5 and R6 independently represent a hydrogen atom or a d-Q alkyl or phenyl group the latter two of which may be optionally substituted by one or more substituent groups independently selected from halogen atoms, phenyl, -OR14 and -NR15R16, -CONR15R16, -NR15COR16, -SONR15R16,<br>
or<br>
R5 and R6 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 4- to<br>
7-membered saturated heterocych'c ring system optionally containing a further heteroatom<br>
selected from oxygen and nitrogen atoms, which ring system may be optionally substituted by<br>
one or more substituent groups independently selected from phenyl, -OR14, -COOR14, -<br>
NR15R16, -CONR15R16, -NR15COR16, -SONR15R16, NR^SOaR16 or CrC6 aDcyl, itself<br>
optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from halogen atoms<br>
and -NR15R16 and -OR17 groups;<br>
R10 represents a hydrogen atom or a Ci-Ce-alkyl or a phenyl group, the latter two of which<br>
may be optionally substituted by one or more substituent groups independently selected from<br>
halogen atoms, phenyl, -OR17 and -NR15R16; and<br>
each of R7, R8, R9, R11, R12, R13, R14 R15, R16, R17 independently represents a hydrogen atom<br>
or a Ci-Q alkyl, or a phenyl group;<br>
which method comprises contacting<br>
wherein L is a leaving group<br>
with a thiazole nitrogen protecting group reagent under appropriate reaction conditions to<br>
form a compound of the formula<br>
wherein PG is a protecting group,<br>
reacting the compound of formula ni with an amine of formula HNR2R3<br>
to form a compound of formula<br>
NR2R3<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
and deprotection of the compound of formula n to give a compound of the formula I, and simultaneous or sequential conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
Convenient leaving groups will be apparent to the chemist of ordinary skill, such as disclosed in 'Advanced Organic Chemistry', 4* edition, J. March, Wiley-Interscience (1992). Such groups will include halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine. Chlorine is a preferred leaving group for use in the invention.<br>
Additional protection may be provided for the amine of formula HNR2^3 for example where R2 and/or R3 comprises a hydroxy or amino group. By way of non-limiting example we refer to Example 3(d) where a particular diol is introduced and protected via the compound (2,2,5-trimethyl-l,3-dioxan-5-yl)amine.<br>
Convenient protecting groups will be apparent to the chemist of ordinary skill It wOl be appreciated that the more stable the resulting product upon protection the likelihood of increased difficulty in removing the protecting group afterwards. Additionally, some resulting products upon protection may not be sufficiently stable to isolation by standard laboratory methods. The protection and deprotection of functional groups is fuUy described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis', 2nd edition, T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience (1991).<br>
Examples of suitable protecting groups for the given transformations, to provide compounds of formula I, involving removal under appropriate hydrolytic conditions are [with suitable protecting group agents indicated in square brackets] methoxymethyl [chloromethyl methyl ether], and particularly ethoxymethyl [chloromethyl ethyl ether or diethoxymethane], benzyloxymethyl [benzyl chloromethyl ether], pivatoyloxymethyl [chloromethyl pivalate],<br>
2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl [2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride], l-(ethoxy)ethyl [ethyl vinyl ether] and 2-tetrahydropyranyl [3,4-dihydro-(2H)-pyran]. Each individual protecting group listed above and its use represents a particular independent aspect of the invention. Base-assisted removal of the 2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyl [phenyl vinyl sulfone] protecting group under non-aqueous conditions is a suitable method for achieving these transformations.<br>
The approach is also suited to catalytic reduction methods for removal of appropriate protecting groups. Such protecting groups include benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenyhnethyl and benzyloxymethyl. Allyl as a protecting group can be removed under metal-assisted conditions and 4-methoxybenzyl, 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl and di(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl can be removed under oxidative conditions. Acyl, benzoyl, pyrrolidinyknethyl and urea-type protecting groups are other examples that can be removed under appropriate hydrolytic conditions. Representative chloroformate reagents do not yield a carbamate protecting group, for example a benzylchtoroformate reagent is found to yield a benzyl protecting group.<br>
In the context of the present specification, unless otherwise indicated, an aDcyl or alkenyl group or an aJkyl or alkenyl moiety in a substituent group may be linear or branched. Aryl groups include phenyl and naphthyL Heteroaryl groups include 5- or 6-membered aromatic rings containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, S, and O. Examples include pyridine, pyrimidine, thiazofe, oxazole, pyrazok, imidazole, furan.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It will be understood that the methods of the invention may be used with all geometric and optical isomers of the compounds of formula (I) and mixtures thereof including racemates. The scientist of ordinary skill will be able to select appropriate intermediate compounds to introduce the appropriate stereochemistry for -NR2R3 and R1 (if appropriate).<br>
Particular compounds of formula (I) are those in which R1 represents an optionally substituted benzyl group. More particularly R1 represents benzyl or benzyl substituted by one or more Ci-Cs aDcyl, d-Q alkoxy or halogen atoms.<br>
When R2 and R3 represent a group substituted by one or more 3-8 membered rings optionally containing one or more atoms selected from O, S or NR8, examples of such groups include piperidine, pyrrolidine, piperazine and morpholine.<br>
Conveniently one of R2 or R3 is hydrogen and the other is Ci-Cg alkyl substituted by hydroxy and one or more methyl or ethyl groups. More conveniently one of R2 or R3 is hydrogen and the other is CH(CH3)CH2OH) CH(Et)CH2OH, CCCHa^CHaOH or<br><br>
CH(CH2OH)2. When one of R2 or R3 is hydrogen and the other is CH(CH3)CH2OH or CH(Et)CH2OH the resulting compounds of formula (I) are particularly in the form of the (R) isomer.<br>
Particular compounds of the formula I for use in the method of the invention include those wherein R1 represents a (2,3-difluorophenyl)methyl group and R2 and R3 together represent a Ci-g alkyl group optionally substituted by one or more substituent groups independently selected from -OR4 wherein R4 represents hydrogen or a Ci-g alkyl group.<br>
Further particular compounds of the formula I include compounds of the formula la<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein each Rx is independently selected from hydrogen, a CM alkyl group optionally substituted by hydroxy, annno, -OC^ alkyl, -S-CM alkyl, -N-CW alkyl, -NHSO2R, or -CONRa and provided that both Rx are not hydrogen or amino.<br>
More particular compounds of the invention are wherein each Rx is independently<br>
iy<br>
selected from hydrogen and hydroxymethyl, provided that both R are not hydrogen.<br>
The invention also provides novel salts of the above compounds namely the potassium salt of the compound wherein one Rx is hydrogen and the other is hydroxymethyl (cf. Example 2) and both the sodium and potassium salts of the compound wherein both Rx are hydroxymethyl (Examples 3 and 4).<br>

Such reaction is known for reaction of the compound of formula VII with a compound L- R1 wherein L is bromine and R1 is (2,3-difluorophenyl)met;hyl, this is disclosed in our WO-03/24966.<br>
The compound of formula VII is conveniently provided as the monohydrate (cf. Example 1 (a)) and is commercially available, for example from Aldrich, Acros or Lancaster.<br>
