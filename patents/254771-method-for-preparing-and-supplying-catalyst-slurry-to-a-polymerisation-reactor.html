				<td>Method and apparatus for preparing and supplying catalyst slurry to a polymerisation<br>
reactor<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to catalytic reactions. In a first aspect, the invention relates to an<br>
apparatus for preparing and supplying catalys t slurry to a polymerisation reactor, the<br>
invention also relates to an apparatus for controlling catalyst feeding to a polymerisation<br>
reactor. In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for optimising the supply of<br>
catalyst to a polymerisation re actor. In yet another aspect the invention relates to a method<br>
for controlling catalyst feeding to a polymerisation reactor.<br>
Background<br>
Polyethylene (PE) is synthesized via polymerizing ethylene (CH 2=CH2) monomer and<br>
optionally a higher 1 -olefin comonomer such as 1 -butene, 1 -hexene, 1 -octene or 1 -decene.<br>
Because PE is cheap, safe, stable,to most environments and easy to be processed<br>
polyethylene polymers are useful in many applications. According to the synthesis methods,<br>
PE can be generally classified in to several types such as LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene),<br>
LLDPE (Linear Low Density Polyethylene), and HOPE (High Density Polyethylene). Each<br>
type of polyethylene has different properties and characteristics.<br>
It is known that the polymerisation of olefins e.g. ethylene, especially by a gas phase<br>
polymerisation process, involves the polymerisation of olefin monomer with the aid of catalyst<br>
and optionally, if required depending on the used catalyst, a co-catalyst Suitable catalysts for<br>
use in the production of polyolefins, and in particular for the preparation of polyethylene,<br>
comprise chromium type catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts and metallocene catalysts.<br>
It is well known that the polymerisation reaction is quite sensitive to the quantity of catalyst<br>
utilized. It is important to control catalyst flow to a reactor since unexpected or uncontrolled<br>
catalyst injection in a reactor could lead to runaway reactions. However, one of the major<br>
problems in the injection of catalyst slurry to a reactor in prior ar t methods is that it is difficult<br>
to control the amount of catalyst and the flow rate of the catalyst injected.<br>
According to prior art catalyst supply systems, catalyst may be provided to a polymerization<br>
reaction either in concentrated form, e.g. directly from a mud pot, or in diluted form.<br><br>
Direct feeding of catalyst slurry from a storage vessel to a reactor has the disadvantage that<br>
the feeding rate of the catalyst to the reactor cannot be adequately controlled. A Iso, in cases<br>
involving direct supply of a (concentrated) catalyst to a reactor, the catalysts can completely<br>
be flushed in the reactor, when a problem occurs during the preparation of the catalysts.<br>
Such uncontrolled catalyst supply may induce runaway reactions in the reactor.<br>
Moreover, in the case catalyst in oil suspension is provided directly to a reactor, the used<br>
pumps, generally progressive cavity pumps, are not able to dose the catalyst flow and the<br>
amount of catalyst injected in the reactor. Furthermore, such systems require the swit ch over<br>
of the catalyst injection system, every time a new batch of catalyst needs to be connected to<br>
the reactor for supply thereto. Therefore, such injection systems do not provide an optimal<br>
and reliable control of the catalyst flow rate.<br>
Several systems have been disclosed which involve the preparation and the supply of diluted<br>
catalyst slurry to a polymerization reaction. In general, for preparing catalyst slurry, a mixture<br>
of dry solid particulate catalyst and diluent are apportioned in a catalyst s torage vessel for<br>
thorough mixing. Then such catalyst slurry is typically transferred directly to a polymerization<br>
reaction vessel for contact with the monomer reactants, generally under high pressure<br>
conditions.<br>
GB 838,395 relates to a process and apparatus for producing a slurry of a solid catalyst in<br>
hydrocarbon diluent for use in a chemical reaction. The process comprises preparing<br>
concentrated catalyst slurry in a hydrocarbon diluent and admixing said concentrated slurry<br>
with additional diluent and i ntroducing said admixture to a reaction zone. According to the<br>
process, the specific inductive capacity of the slurry is continuously determined prior to the introduction of same to said reaction zone, the inductive capacity of the slurry being<br>
dependent u pon the concentration of catalyst in the slurry.<br>
US 3,726,845 describes a system wherein catalyst slurry is prepared in a vessel after which it<br>
is pumped to the polymerization reactor by means of a conduit provided with a pump. The<br>
catalyst slurry formed in the vessel and diluent are alternately fed through said conduit to the<br>
polymerization reactor by flowing catalyst for a selected number of seconds and then diluent<br>
for a selected number of seconds through the conduit to the polymerization reactor.<br><br>
WO 2004/0264455 describes a catalyst slurry feeding system wherein diluted catalyst slurry<br>
is formed in a mixing tank and transferred to a storage tank, wherein it is maintained in diluted<br>
form before being supplied to a polymerization reactor. Catalyst slurry is supplied from the<br>
mixing to the storage tank by means of a conduit provided with a valve. The mixing tank can<br>
be at a higher elevation than the storage tank, so that the catalyst slurry flows from the mixing<br>
tank to the storage tank at least partiall y due to gravity, thereby avoiding the necessity of a<br>
pump between the mixing tank and the storage tank. Alternatively, the catalyst slurry can be<br>
moved between the tanks without a pump or a difference in elevation by maintaining a<br>
pressure differential be tween the mixing tank and the storage tank .<br>
US 5,098,667 discloses a catalyst supply system involving the transfer of concentrated<br>
catalyst from a mud pot to a dilution vessel through a conduit which includes a valve system<br>
for regulating the transfer. Diluted catalyst slurry is continuously supplied to the<br>
polymerization reactor by means of a conduit. In the described method the flow rate of the<br>
diluted slurry is manipulated so as to provide a desired flow rate of solid particles contained in<br>
the diluted slurry. Continuous catalyst flow is maintained at a desired rate in response to a<br>
computed value of the mass flow rate of the solid catalyst particles contained in the dilute<br>
slurry. The computed mass flow rate of catalyst particles is based upon "on lin e"<br>
measurements of density and flow rate of the dilute catalyst slurry stream flowing to the<br>
reactor, and on predetermined densities of the solid catalyst particles and the liquid diluent<br>
constituting the slurry.<br>
However, although the above -described methods for preparing diluted catalyst provide an<br>
improvement on the control of catalyst flow, they have the disadvantage that the catalyst flow<br>
rate can not be reliably adjusted in function of the reaction conditions in the polymerisation<br>
reactor.	<br>
Another problem associated with available systems for preparing diluted catalyst is that these<br>
systems are relatively voluminous and cumbersome, and sometimes involve several tanks for<br>
storing diluted catalyst slurry. In addition, the use of large vessels and larg e amounts of<br>
diluent for preparing the diluted catalyst slurry impl ies several considerable disadvantages.<br>
The use of large volumes of diluted catalyst implies the use of large volumes of diluent (i.e.<br>
isobutane). Isobutane however, is an explosive chemica I and may pose security problems.<br><br>
Furthermore, when switching of catalyst type in a polymerization process, large amounts of<br>
catalyst material may remain unused and may need to be disposed off, which is not only very<br>
expensive but also implicates severe environmental regulations. In addition, the costs for<br>
cleaning the voluminous catalyst preparation systems after removal of the catalyst are high.<br>
Therefore, there remains a need in the art for providing an improved method for controlling<br>
catalyst feeding to a polymerization reactor. More in particular, there remains a great need in<br>
the art for a system that continuously and reliably delivers diluted catalyst slurry to a loop<br>
reactor.<br>
Furthermore, metallocene and Ziegler-Natta catalysts are usually employ ed with a co-catalyst<br>
for olefin polymerization, which can significantly enhance the polymerization efficiencies to<br>
beyond a million units of polymer per unit of catalyst. A number of techniques for the<br>
introduction of the co-catalyst to a polymerization reactor has been proposed. For instance<br>
some techniques consist of introducing the co -catalyst directly into the polymerization reactor.<br>
However, such technique does not allow bringing the co -catalyst into contact with the catalyst<br>
before entering the reactor, although such pre-contact is particularly desirable in order to<br>
provide effective catalyst-co-catalyst mixtures. Another technique consists of contacting the<br>
catalyst and co-catalyst before their introduction into the polymerization medium. In this lat ter<br>
case, however, having regard to the fact that the catalyst systems employed usually have<br>
maximum activity at the commencement of polymerization, it may be difficult to avoid reaction<br>
runaways liable to involve the formation of hot spots and of agglomer ates of molten polymer.<br>
In view hereof, it can be concluded that there remains also a need in the art for providing an<br>
improved method for controlling catalyst feeding, in pre -contact with a co-catalyst, to a<br>
polymerization reactor.<br>
It is therefore a gen eral object of this invention to provide an improved method and apparatus<br>
for optimising catalyst introduction in a polymerisation reactor. It is a particular object of the<br>
present invention to optimise the supply of a catalyst, commercially provided in an oil<br>
suspension or in a hydrocarbon solution, to a polymerisation reactor wherein polyethylene is<br>
prepared. More in particular, the present invention also aims to provide a n apparatus and<br>
method enabling to effectively control the flow rate of a catalyst t o a polymerisation reactor<br>
wherein polyethylene is prepared.<br><br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
controlling catalyst feeding, being in pre-contact with a co-catalyst, to a polymerisation<br>
reactor, wherein polyethylene is prepared.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention aims to provide a method and an apparatus for improved<br>
control of the polymerization reaction of ethylene in a reactor.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus and a method are provided for<br>
preparing and supplying catalyst slurry to a polymerisation reactor and for controlling the<br>
injection of catalyst slurry into a polymerization reactor wherein polyethylene is prepared.<br>
Said catalyst slurry consists of solid catalyst in a hydrocarbon diluent<br>
In a first aspect, the invention relates to an apparatus for preparing and supplying catalyst<br>
slurry to a polymerization reactor wherein polyethylene is prepared, comprising<br>
-	one or more storage vessels for cont aining concentrated catalyst slurry consisting of<br>
solid catalyst particles suspended in a hydrocarbon diluent or in a mineral oil,<br>
-	a mixing vessel for containing diluted catalyst slurry of a suitable concentration for use<br>
in a polymerization reaction, being connected with said storage vessels by one or<br>
- more conduits for transferring said catalyst slurry from said storage vessels to said<br>
mixing vessel, and being provided with one or more conduits for transferring the<br>
diluted catalyst slurry from said mixing vessel to said reactor, and<br>
-	one or more conduits, connecting said mixing vessel to a polymerization reactor for<br>
transferring said diluted catalyst slurry from said mixing vessel to said reactor,<br>
whereby each conduit is provided with a membrane pump for pumping said slurry to<br>
said reactor, which is controllable in function of the concentration of a reactant in said<br>
reactor.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus, which allows preparing catalyst slurry having a<br>
suitable concentration for use in a poly merisation reaction, starting from catalyst, which is<br>
generally commercially supplied in a mineral oil, heptane or hexane suspension. Sometimes<br>
it is supplied in dry form.<br><br>
According to the present invention, the catalyst is not introduced directly from th e storage<br>
vessels (also referred herein to a catalyst transport vessel) to the reactor. The apparatus<br>
further comprises a mixing vessel, which acts as a "buffer* between the storage vessels and<br>
the reactor. As used herein the terms "mixing vessel" and "buf fer vessel" are used as<br>
synonyms. The mixing vessel is operated at a pressure lower than the reactor pressure, thus<br>
eliminating the risk of uncontrolled high catalyst injection under high pressure to the reactor.<br>
Furthermore, such mixing vessel enables to dampen the discontinuous catalyst feed<br>
fluctuations to the reactor. Another advantage of providing a mixing vessel is that catalyst<br>
slurry can be further diluted to a concentration suitable for use in the polymerization reactor<br>
and that a slurry having a d esired, substantially constant, concentration can be prepared.<br>
Moreover, a suitable, relatively low, concentration of catalyst, preferably comprised between .<br>
0.1 and 10 % by weight, more preferably between 0.1 and 4 %, even more preferred between<br>
0.1 and 1 % and most preferred 0.5 % by weight, will enable to use membrane pumps for<br>
injecting the catalyst slurry in the reactor. Using of diluted catalyst slurry has the advantage<br>
that it is easier to control the amount and the flow of injected catalyst.<br>
The use of membrane pumps in the present apparatus permits to transfer catalyst slurry to<br>
said reactor at controllable catalyst flow rate. In addition, the membrane pumps are<br>
particularly suitable for adjusting catalyst flow rate to a suitable value which is in accordance<br>
with the polymerization reaction faking place in the reactor , since these pumps are<br>
controllable in function of the concentration of a reactant in said reactor.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to an apparatus wherein one of more c onduits<br>
for transferring catalyst slurry from said storage vessel to said mixing vessel comprises<br>
diluent injection means. These injection means are particularly suitable for enabling the<br>
dilution of catalyst slurry in line before being injected in the reactor, and in particular for<br>
diluting the catalyst slurry while transferring the slurry from the storage vessel to the mixing<br>
vessel.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to an apparatus which further<br>
comprises flow measuring means for measuring the catalyst flow rate provided on said<br>
conduit for transferring the diluted catalyst slurry from said mixing vessel to said reactor .<br><br>
Another problem relating to the field of catalyst supply to a reactor consists of supplying a co -<br>
catalyst during a polymerisation reaction. A number of techniques for the introduction of the<br>
co-catalyst have already been proposed, for example by introducing the co -catalyst directly<br>
into the polymerisation reactor. However, such methods do not allow bringing co -catalyst into<br>
contact with the catalyst before entering the reactor, although such pre -contact may be<br>
particularly desirable in order to provide effective catalyst -co-catalyst mixtures. Another<br>
technique consists of contacting the catalyst and co -catalyst before their introduction into the<br>
polymerisation medium. In this latter case, however, it is difficult to control the pre -contact<br>
time of the catalyst with the co -catalyst.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present apparatus is therefore further provided with a co-catalyst<br>
distribution system (herein also referred to as to a co -catalyst feeding system), for bringing a<br>
suitable amount of co -catalyst into contact with the catalyst slurry f or a suitable period of time<br>
before supplying said catalyst slurry to said reactor. In a preferred embodiment said system<br>
comprises a co-catalyst storage vessel and a conduit connected thereto for transferring said<br>
co-catalyst. In another preferred embodiment, said conduit is provided with a contact vessel<br>
for enhancing the cont act time of said co -catalyst with said catalyst slurry in said conduit.<br>
in another aspect, the invention relates to a method for optimising the supply of a catalyst<br>
slurry to a polymerisation reactor wherein polyethylene is prepared, comprising the steps of:<br>
-	providing concentrated catalyst slurry consisting of solid catalyst particles suspended<br>
in a hydrocarbon diluent or in a mineral oil in one or more storage vessels,<br>
-	diluting said concentrated catalyst slurry for obtaining a suitable concentration for use<br>
in a polymerisation reaction, whereby said catalyst slurry is diluted while being<br>
transferred from said storage vessel to a mixing vessel , wherein said diluted catalyst<br>
slurry is maintained,<br>
-	optionally further diluting said catalyst slurry in said st orage vessel, and<br>
-	pumping said diluted catalyst slurry at a controlled flow rate from said mixing vessel to<br>
said polymerisation reactor through one or more conduits, by means of a pumping<br>
means, provided in each of said conduits.<br>
The present methods provide improved injection of catalyst that is commercially supplied as<br>
solid particles at a suitable, controlled and limited flow rate in a polymerization reactor.<br>
Therefor, the methods broadly involve the transfer of concentrated catalyst slurry to a buffer<br><br>
vessel wherein catalyst is diluted and kept at a suitable concentration, before it is injected in<br>
the reactor. The method does not involve direct injection of catalyst from a storage vessel to a<br>
reactor. The present method is further in particular charact erized in that the catalyst slurry is<br>
diluted in line before being injected in the reactor, and in particular is diluted while being<br>
transferred from said storage vessel to a mixing vessel , wherein said catalyst slurry may<br>
optionally be further diluted.<br>
The present invention provides in particular a method that enables to supply catalyst slurry to<br>
a reactor at a perfectly controllable flow rate of catalyst supply. The present method<br>
comprises controlling the suitable flow rate of said catalyst slurry to s aid reactor by<br>
determining the concentration of a reactant in said reactor. Advantageously the present<br>
method enables to fine -tune catalyst supply to a reactor in function of the polymerisation<br>
reaction in the reactor. The polymerisation production rate in the reactor can be controlled by<br>
controlling the rate of catalyst feed to the reactor. According to this aspect the reactor is fed<br>
with an adequate and optimal concentration of catalyst slurry at a suitable feed rate, and as a<br>
consequence the productivity in the polymerisation reactor and consistency of the<br>
polymerisation product are considerably improved. Fluctuations in the properties and quality<br>
of the polymerisation product resulting from the polymerisation reaction are substantially<br>
avoided. Practically, fine-tuning of catalyst supply to a reactor in function of the<br>
polymerisation reaction is enabled by providing the conduit connecting the buffer vessel to<br>
the reactor with pumps, preferably membrane pumps, which are controllable and adjustable<br>
in function of a reactant concentration in the reactor.<br>
More in particular, pumping means, preferably membrane pumps, are provided in each<br>
conduit for transferring the catalyst slurry from the mixing vessel to the polymerisation<br>
reactor. These pumps assure the t ransfer of catalyst slurry to said reactor at controllable flow<br>
rate. Moreover, the membrane pumps are capable of being regulated to adjust catalyst flow<br>
to said reactor in function of the polymerisation reaction in said reactor, since these pumps<br>
are controllable and adjustable in function of a reactant concentration in the reactor.<br>
According to the invention the present apparatus and method enable to feed a reactor with an<br>
optimal concentration of catalyst slurry at a suitable catalyst flow rate, and as a consequence<br>
thereof enable to considerably improve the productivity in the polymerisation reaction in the<br>
reactor.<br><br>
The present invention thus provides an apparatus and method for optimising the<br>
polymerisation reaction in a reactor by optimising the pr ocess of catalyst supply to said<br>
reactor and by providing a n apparatus for doing so, which is simple in design, nigged in<br>
construction and economical to manufacture. The term "optimising the polymerisation<br>
reaction" refers to the improvement of the efficiency of the polymerization reaction and/or to<br>
the improvement of the quality of the obtained polymerization product.<br>
The method and the apparatus according to the invention are particularly useful in the<br>
polymerisation process of ethylene, and preferably i n a process for preparing bimodal<br>
polyethylene.<br>
The various features which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the<br>
claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the<br>
invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference is<br>
made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention are illustrated.<br>

Detailed description of the inven tion<br>
This invention is especially applicable to a process of supplying a catalyst to a polymerisation<br>
reactor. The invention is in particular described with reference to the supply of catalyst to a<br>
slurry loop polymerisation reactor wherein ethylene is polymerised. The polymerisation<br>
process of ethylene may for instance be carried out in loop reactors. Suitable 'ethylene<br>
polymerisation" includes but is not limited to homo -polymerisation of ethylene, co -<br><br>
polymerisation of ethylene and a higher 1 -olefin co-monomer such as butene, 1 -pentene, 1 -<br>
hexene, 1 -octene or 1 -decene. Ethylene polymeris ation comprises feeding to a reactor the<br>
reactants including the monomer ethylene, a light hydrocarbon diluent, a catalyst and<br>
optionally, a co-monomer and hydrogen. In an embodiment of the present invention, said co -<br>
monomer is hexene and said diluent is isobutane.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a process of supplying a<br>
catalyst to a polymerisation reactor wherein bimodal polyethylene is pre pared. "Bimodal PE"<br>
refers to PE that is manufactured using two reactors, which are connected to each other in<br>
series. However, the present method for improving and optimising catalyst supply to a<br>
polymerisation reactor should be understood to be applicable to reactors wherein other types<br>
of polymerisation reactions take place as well.<br>
According to the present invention the term "catalyst" is defined herein as a substance that<br>
causes a change in the rate of a polymerization reaction without itself being co nsumed in the<br>
reaction. Any catalyst allowing ethylene to be polymerised may be used. By way of examples<br>
of such catalysts, mention may be made of catalysts of the Ziegler -Natta type, catalysts<br>
based on vanadium or chromium, and metallocene catalysts. According to one preferred<br>
embodiment said catalyst is a metallocene or chromium catalyst. According to another<br>
embodiment, said catalyst may also be a Ziegler -Natta catalyst In another particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, said catalyst may comprise any catalys t which is provided on a Si<br>
support.<br>
Catalyst slurry can be prepared in different ways. One way consists of preparing catalyst<br>
slurry starting from solid catalyst particles, which are suspended in a suitable diluent e.g. a<br>
hydrocarbon. Generally, such c atalyst slurry can be transferred directly to a polymerisation<br>
reaction vessel for contact with the monomer reactants.<br>
Catalyst slurry can also be obtained commercially in the form of solid catalyst particles, which<br>
are suspended in a mineral oil. Direct injection of such catalyst slurry in the reactor can be<br>
done by connecting the commercial vessel containing the catalyst in oil suspension with the<br>
reactor by means of conduits that are provided with suitable pumps. Such pumps typically are<br>
suitable for pumping liquids with significant amounts of solids, e.g. solid particles in crude oil.<br><br>
Examples of pumps of this type are commonly known as Moineau pumps or progressive<br>
cavity pumps, and are available commercially-<br>
Several methods for supplying catalyst to a polymerisation reactor have been described in<br>
the prior art. For instance, US 3,846.394 describes a process for the introduction of Ziegler -<br>
Natta catalyst slurry in a reactor. The process comprises the preparation of Ziegler -Natta<br>
catalyst slurry, the transfer of the slurry via a feed conduit from a storage zone to a metering<br>
zone, and the introduction of the slurry into a reactor. In order to avoid the back flow of<br>
monomer and other contents of the reactor into the Ziegler -Natta catalyst conduits the<br>
process provides the catalyst feed conduit to be flushed with an inert diluent to the Ziegler -<br>
Natta catalyst, said diluent being introduced into said conduit downstream of the metering<br>
zone.<br>
Catalyst systems for polymerisation and co -polymerisation of olefins known as Ziegler-Natta<br>
systems consist on the one hand, as catalyst, of compounds of transition metals belonging to<br>
Groups IV to VII of the periodic table of elements, and on the other hand, as co -catalysts, of<br>
organometallic compounds of metals of Grou ps I to III of this Table. The catalyst3 most<br>
frequently used are the halogenated derivatives of titanium and vanadium, preferably<br>
associated with compounds of magnesium. Moreover, the co -catalysts most frequently used<br>
are organoaluminium or organozinc com pounds. A characteristic of all Ziegler-Natta catalysts<br>
is that they all yield straight chain polymers.<br>
The Ziegler-Natta catalyst is preferably of the general formula MX„ wherein M is a transition<br>
metal compound selected from group IV to VII, wherein X is a halogen, and wherein n is the<br>
valence of the metal. Preferably, M is a group IV, group V or group VI metal, more preferably<br>
titanium, chromium or vanadium and most preferably titanium. Preferably, R is chlorine or<br>
bromine, and most preferably, chlorine. Illustrative examples of the transition metal<br>
compounds comprise but are not limited to TiCl3, TiCl4. In a particularly preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention said catalyst is a titanium tetrachloride (TiCI 4) catalyst<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalysts generall y are provided on a support, i.e. deposited on a solid support.<br>
The support should be an inert solid, which is chemically unreactive with any of the<br>
components of the conventional Ziegler -Natta catalyst. The support is preferably a silica or<br>
magnesium compound. Examples of the magnesium compounds which are to be used to<br><br>
provide a support source for the catalyst component are magnesium halides,<br>
dialkoxymagnesiums, alkoxymagnesium halides, magnesium oxyhalides, dialkyimagnesiums,<br>
magnesium oxide, magnesium hy droxide, and carboxylates of magnesium.<br>
The term "metallocene catalyst" is used to describe any transition metal complexes consisting<br>
of metal atoms "sandwiched" between one or two ligands. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
metallocene catalyst has a general formula MX, wherein M is a transition metal compound<br>
selected from group IV and wherein X is a ligand composed of one or two groups of<br>
cyclopentadienyl (Cp), indenyl, fluorenyl or their derivatives. Illustrative examples of<br>
metallocene catalysts comprise but are not limited to Cp2ZrCI2. Cp2TiCI2 or Cp2HfCl2.<br>
The metallocene catalysts generally are provided on a solid support. The support should be<br>
an inert solid, which is chemically unreactive with any of the components of the conventional<br>
metallocene catalyst. The support is preferably a silica compound.<br>
The use of metallocene catalysts in the production of polyolefins in general, and of<br>
polyethylene in particular, is known in the art. The metallocene catalysts are compounds of<br>
Group IV transition meta Is of the Periodic Table such as titanium, zirconium, hafnium, etc.,<br>
and have a coordinated structure with a metal compound and ligands composed of one or<br>
two groups of cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, fluorenyl or their derivatives. Use of metallocene<br>
catalysts in the polymerisation of olefins has various advantages. Metallocene catalysts have<br>
high activities and are capable of preparing polymers with enhanced physical properties in<br>
comparison with the polymers prepared using Ziegler -Natta catalysts. Metallocene catalysts<br>
are usually employed with a co -catalyst such as an organometallic compound, or a mixture of<br>
non-coordinated Lewis acid and alkylaluminium as it is well known in the art. The key to<br>
metallocenes is the structure of the complex. The structure and geometry of the metallocene<br>
can be varied to adapt to the specific need of the producer depending on the desired<br>
polymer. Metallocenes comprise a single metal site, which allows for more control of<br>
branching and molecular weight distribution of the polymer. Monomers are inserted between<br>
the metal and growing chain of polymer.<br>
Chromium-type catalysts refer to catalysts obtained by deposition of chromium oxyde on a<br>
support, e.g. a silica or aluminum support. Illustrative examples of chromium catalysts<br>
comprise but are not limited to CrSiO2 or OAI2O3.<br><br>
Generally co-catalysts are used to improve the activity of a Ziegler -Natta or a metallocene<br>
catalyst. The term "co -catalyst" as used herein is defined as a catalyst that can be used in<br>
conjunction with anothe r catalyst in order to improve the activity and the availability of the<br>
other catalyst in a polymerisation reaction. In a preferred embodiment, said co -catalyst is a<br>
catalyst suitable for being used in conjunction with a Ziegler -Natta catalyst or a metallo cene<br>
catalyst. The co-catalyst is used to promote the polymerisation activity of the Ziegler-Natta<br>
catalyst or the metallocene catalyst. Broadly, organometalllc compounds of periodic groups I<br>
to III can be used as co-catalyst according to the present inven tion. Catalysts suitable for<br>
being used in conjunction with a metallocene catalyst may include organometalllc<br>
compounds, or a mixture of non -coordinated Lewis acids and alkylaluminiums.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, said co -catalyst is a catalyst suitable for being used in<br>
conjunction with a Ziegler-Natta or a metallocene catalyst and is an organoaluminium<br>
compound, being optionally halogenated, having general formula AIR 3 or AIR2Y, wherein R is<br>
an alky! having 1-16 carbon atoms and R may be the same or different and wherein Y is<br>
hydrogen or a halogen. Examples of co -catalysts comprise but are not limited to trimethyl<br>
aluminum, triethyl aluminum, di -isobutyl aluminum hydride, is tri-isobutyl aluminium, tri-hexyl<br>
aluminum, diethyl aluminum chlorid e, or diethyl aluminum ethoxide. A particularly preferred<br>
co-catalyst for use in the present invention is tri -isobutyl aluminium (TIBAL).<br>
As used herein, the term "catalyst slurry" refers to a composition comprising catalyst solid<br>
particles that are in suspension. The term "concentrated catalyst slurry" refers to a<br>
composition comprising catalyst solid particles that are in suspension whereby the<br>
concentration of catalyst is at least higher than 10 % by weight. The term "diluted catalyst<br>
slurry" refers to a composition comprising catalyst solid particles that are in suspension,<br>
whereby the concentration of catalyst is lower than or equal to 10 % by weight.<br>
The hereunder-described embodiments of an apparatus according to the present invention<br>
correspond to the required equipment for preparation and injection of one catalyst If two or<br>
more (different) catalysts need to be fed to a reactor, two or more apparatuses according to<br>
the present invention can be supplied or a catalyst blend can be prepared and su pplied using<br>
an apparatus according to the present invention.<br><br>
In a first embodiment, the invention relates to an apparatus for controlling the injection of<br>
catalyst slurry in a polymerization reactor comprising<br>
-	one or more storage vessels for storing ca tafyst slurry consisting of solid catalyst in a<br>
hydrocarbon diluent, whereby each vessel is provided with means for transferring<br>
said catalyst slurry from said storage vessels to a mixing vessel,<br>
-	a mixing vessel, being connected with said storage vessels by means of said<br>
transferring means, for diluting said catalyst slurry to a suitable concentration for use<br>
in a polymerisation reaction, and<br>
-	one or more conduits, connecting said mixing vessel to a polymerization reactor for<br>
transferring said diluted catalyst slurry from said mixing vessel to said reactor,<br>
whereby each conduit is provided with a pumping means for pumping said slurry to<br>
said reactor.<br>
This embodiment of the apparatus is in particular suitable for controlling the injection of<br>
metallocene catalyst slurry or chromium catalyst slurry in a polymerization reactor wherein<br>
polyethylene is prepared.<br>
In a preferred embodiment said one or more conduits for transferring catalyst slurry from said<br>
storage vessels to said mixing vessel comprise a first c onduit for transferring said catalyst<br>
slurry from a first storage vessel to a mixing vessel which is interchan geable with a second<br>
conduit for transferring said catalyst slurry from a second storage vessel to a mixing vessel<br>
through lines connecting said first means with said second means.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, said conduits for transferring said catalyst slurry from a<br>
storage vessel to a mixing vessel, each are provided with a metering valve, provided<br>
downstream the connecting lines.<br>
This embodiment of the invention will be described hereunder with reference to the control of<br>
feeding of a metallocene catalyst supported on silica impregnated by methylaluminoxane<br>
(MAO), to a polymerisation reactor wherein ethylene is polymerised. In a preferr ed<br>
embodiment, isobutane is used as diluent for the metallocene catalyst. As co-catalyst for the<br>
metallocene catalyst, reference is made to a tri -isobutyl aluminium co -catalyst, referred to as<br>
TIBAL herein. However, it should be understood that the present device is applicable to other<br><br>
types of catalysts, such as for instance chromium catalysts, and to other types of co -catalysts<br>
as well.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, an apparatus according to the present invention is illustrated. The<br>
apparatus comprises one or more catalyst storage vessels, or so -called mud tank or pot 2<br>
which contain solid -liquid slurry of metallocene catalyst and isobutane diluent. The slurry is<br>
fed from the mud pot 2 through the combination of conduit 6, 7 and conduit 15 to a mixing<br>
vessel 3, wherein the slurry is diluted to a suitable concentration. In addition, the apparatus<br>
further comprises one or more conduits 4 which connect the mixing vessel 3 to a<br>
polymerization reactor 1 and through which the diluted catalyst slurry is pumped from sa id<br>
mixing vessel 3 to the reactor 1, by means of pumping means 5 provided in these conduits 4.<br>
The metallocene catalysts can be provided under a dry form in commercially available drums<br>
or tote bins 26. In general such drums containing dry catalyst powde r are not able to handle<br>
high pressures. For instance, the pressure in such drum may comprise approximately<br>
between 1.1 and 1.5 bar, and preferably 1.3 bar. Depending on the diluent used, it may be<br>
required to bring the catalyst under higher pressure condi tions in the storage vessel 2. Using<br>
appropriate systems, the catalyst is therefore preferably transferred from such drums to a<br>
storage vessel 2, which is suitable for handling higher pressures, if this is required by the<br>
diluent. This is for instance the case when isobutane is used, since this diluent is only liquid at<br>
higher pressure levels. In case for instance hexane is used as diluent, storage vessel 2 is not<br>
required, since this diluent is liquid at low pressures. According to a preferred embodiment,<br>
the metallocene catalyst is provided from drums 26 to a storage vessel 2 through a conduit<br>
27, preferably by means of nitrogen pneumatic transfer or by gravity. However, it is clear that<br>
also other types of catalyst feeding to the storage vessel are suitab le and fall within the scope<br>
of the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, the metallocene catalyst can also be<br>
provided in a commercial container that is suitable for handling higher pressure comprised<br>
between 7 and 16 bar. In such case such com mercial container is considered as a storage<br>
vessel 2 and the catalyst can be fed directly from this commercial container to a mixing<br>
vessel 3. Isobutane diluent is brought into the storage vessel 2 by means of a control valve.<br>
In the storage vessel, the metallocene catalyst is stored under liquid olefin free isobutane<br>
pressure, preferably comprised between 7 and 16 bar. The pressure in the storage vessel is<br>
preferably lower than the pressure in the reactor, in order to avoid leakage of catalyst from<br><br>
the storage vessel to the reactor. Catalyst settles in storage vessel 2, since no agitation<br>
means are provided in this vessel.<br>
The catalyst is subsequently transferred by means of transferring means from the storage<br>
vessels 2 to a mixing vessel 3 wherein said catalyst is diluted for obtaining a suitable<br>
concentration for use in a polymerisation reaction. Preferably the catalyst mixtures in the<br>
storage vessel 2 which contain proportionally high amounts of solids are fed to the mixing<br>
vessel 3 through conduits 6, 7. As represented, two storage vessels are connected with two<br>
different conduits 6, 7 to a common mixing vessel 3. In such case, the catalyst mixtures in<br>
conduits 6, 7 are preferably discharged in a common conduit 15, before being supplied to the<br>
mixing vessel 3. However, according to the invention, also only one storage vessel 2 may be<br>
provided. To avoid remaining catalyst in storage vessel 2, the vessel is flushed with<br>
isobutane, such that remaining catalyst is transferred to the mixing vessel 3.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the conduits 6, 7 are interconnected by means of<br>
connecting lines 8. Such lines 8 enable that the different storage vessels 2 can be used in<br>
accordance with all provided conduits 6, 7. For instance, as represented in FIG . 1, in case<br>
two storage vessels 2 are provided, each having a conduit 6 or 7, the conduit 6 for<br>
transferring said catalyst from a first storage vessel 2 to a mixing vessel 3 is interchangeable<br>
with a second conduit 7 for transferring said catalyst from a second storage vessel 2 to a<br>
mixing vessel 3 through lines 8 connecting said first 6 with said second 7 conduit. Such<br>
interconnection permits, in case of interruption of catalyst transfer through one conduit 6, to<br>
discharge the catalyst to the mixing vesse 13 through a second conduit 7.<br>
Each conduit 6, 7 is preferably equipped with metering valves 9 allowing the feeding of a<br>
controlled flow rate of catalyst to the mixing vessel 3. These valves are preferably provided<br>
downstream the connecting lines 8. The pressure difference between the storage vessel 2<br>
and the mixing vessel 3 supplies the motive force to feed the catalyst to the mixing vessel.<br>
The metering valves 9 allow the transfer of a predetermined volume of catalyst to the mixing<br>
vessel 3. The catal yst slurry discharged by the valves is carried to the mixing vessel by an<br>
isobutane flow. Therefore, the conduits 6, 7, each are preferably further provided with a port<br>
24, which can be connected for flushing with diluent Said port is preferably provided<br>
downstream the valves 9.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the metering valves 9 are ball check feeder or shot feeder valves.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a ball check feeder valve arrangement suitable for utilization in the present<br>
apparatus. However, it is clear that o ther types of valves could be used as well in accordance<br>
to the present invention. Referring to Fig. 2, a preferred embodiment of a valve is represented<br>
which includes a body 16, having an inlet 17 and an outlet 18, a member 19, containing a<br>
metering chamber 20, which is rotatable within the body 16 for communicating with the inlet<br>
17 and outlet 18 in at least two positions, a ball shaped piston 21, which moves with a<br>
reciprocating motion within the chamber 20 as the member 20 is rotated. The working<br>
mechanism of such valve involves a sequence of charging, valve actuation and dumping of a<br>
specific volume of catalyst slurry from a storage vessel 2 to a mixing vessel 3. During<br>
operation, when the valve takes a first position, a fixed quantity of concentrated s lurry flows<br>
through the inlet 17 and fills a chamber 20 within the valve 9. Said quantity is released to the<br>
mixing vessel 3 when the valve is actuated to a second position. The valve 9 thus delivers a<br>
fixed volume of concentrated slurry from storage vess el 2.<br>
More in detail the mechanism of action of this special ball check valve 9 is the following. The<br>
valve 9 is charged or filled with a predetermined volume of a mixture of catalyst and diluent<br>
when in a first position. Periodically this ball check valv e is actuated to a second position and<br>
this volume of the mixture is dumped from the valve into the mixing vessel 3. The ball check<br>
valve 9 is then recharged or refilled with the predetermined volume of the mixture in<br>
preparation for actuation back to the first position where the second volume of mixture is<br>
dumped from the valve 9 into the mixing vessel 3. Concentrated slurry flow from storage<br>
vessel 2 to the mixing vessel 3 is thus accomplished by the cyclic operation of the metering<br>
valve 9. The cycle tim e of the valves determines the catalyst flow rate to the mixing vessel 3.<br>
For instance, when this cycle time is increased, the flow rate of catalyst decreases.<br>
Due to the high degree of dilution and the use of membrane pumps the catalyst feeding<br>
system from the storage vessel 2 to the mixing vessel 3 advantage ously allows providing<br>
catalyst at a controlled flow rate to the mixing vessel 3. In addition, the feeding system<br>
permits to keep the concentration of catalyst slurry in the mixing vessel 3 at a subs tantially<br>
constant level, since catalyst flow regulated by the valve 9 to the mixing vessel 3 is<br>
dependent on the dosed amount (concentration) of catalyst and diluent in the mixing vessel 3.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the concentration of c atalyst slurry in the mixing<br><br>
vessel is kept at a substantially constant level. According to the invention the ratio between<br>
diluent and catalyst is adequately controlled. This is enabled by adequate control of catalyst<br>
feeding from the storage vessel by me ans of the catalyst feeding system and metering valves<br>
9, and by release of a suitable amount of isobutane to the mixing vessel.<br>
Catalyst wastes can be sent to one or more dump vessels 28, which are preferably provided<br>
with stirring means 25 and contain mineral oil for neutralization and elimination of the wastes.<br>
The dump vessels are preferably connected by means of conduits 29 to the catalyst feeding<br>
conduits 6 or 7, upstream of the metering valves 9. The dump vessel 28 is preferably also<br>
connected to the mixing vessel 3, for transferring catalyst wastes by means of a conduit 23.<br>
The dump is provided with a heated vessel, e.g. steam jacket, where the isobutane is<br>
evaporated and sent to distillation or to the flare. In order to avoid the transfer of catal yst<br>
fragments when transferring the evaporated isobutane, guard filters are provided with the<br>
dump vessels 28. The dump vessels 28 are also provided with pressure controlling means for<br>
controlling the pressure in said vessels. The catalyst waste remaining after evaporation of the<br>
diluent is removed from the vessels 28, preferably by means of a draining system, provided at<br>
the bottom of the vessel 28, and the removed waste is discharged into drums and further<br>
destroyed.<br>
According to the present invention, t he metallocene catalyst is transferred from the storage<br>
vessels 2 to a mixing vessel 3. A stream of isobutane is provided to mixing vessel 3 through a<br>
valve which is operably located in conduits 6 and 7. An additional function of this stream is to<br>
dillute the concentrated slurry. The mixing vessel 3 can be operated either when full of liquid<br>
or not Preferably, the mixing vessel 3 is operated full of liquid, since if there is an interphase<br>
with nitrogen the catalyst slurry might settle or stick to the walls in the vessel.<br>
Preferably, the metallocene catalyst slurry is diluted in a hydrocarbon diluent in the mixing<br>
vessel 3 to a concentration between 0.1 % and 10 % by weight. More p referably the slurry is<br>
diluted in a hydrocarbon diluent to a concentration comprised between 0.1 % and 4 % by<br>
weight, more preferred between 0.1 and 1 %, and even more preferred of 0.5 % by weight.<br>
Preparing diluted slurry having these concentrations advantageously enables the further use<br>
of membrane pumps 5 for injecting the slurry in the reactor 1, as described into more detail<br>
below. The mixing vessel 3 is also provided with a stirrer 25 for maintaining the homogeneity<br>
of the slurry.<br><br>
Dilute catalyst slurry is withdrawn from the mixing vessel 3 through one or more conduits 4<br>
and provided through these conduits to a polymerization reactor 1. Each conduit 4 is provided<br>
with a pumping means 5, which controls the transfer and injection of the metallocene catalyst<br>
slurry into the reactors 1. In a particularly preferred embodiment, s aid pumping means are<br>
membrane pumps. The conduits 4 preferably leave the mixing vessel 3 in upward direction<br>
under an angle preferably superior to 10°, and more preferably superior to 30°. In addition,<br>
the conduit provided downwards the pumping means 5 conducts the catalyst slurry preferably<br>
downwardly, under an angle preferably superior to 10°. Such configuration improves the<br>
action of the pumping means 5 and also enables to avoid plugging in the pumping means S<br>
since under this configuration the slurry t ends to settle away from the pumps 5 in case the<br>
pumps 5 are interrupted or stopped. However, it is to be understood that conducts which<br>
extend downwardly are not required if sufficient flushing of the conduit 4 can be obtained.<br>
The conduits 4 are further provided with isobutane flushing means, either at the inlet 30, at<br>
the outlet 33 or at both sides of the membrane pumps 5, as illustrated on FIG. 1. Isobutane<br>
flushing means 30, 33 enable to flush isobutane through the conduit 4 and to keep the<br>
conduits 4 and the pumping means 5 unplugged. Preferably, there is continuous flushing of<br>
the conduit 4 downstream the membrane pump 5 to the reactor 1 by means of isobutane<br>
flushing means 33. The conduit 4 upstream the pump 5 may be flushed discontinuously, by<br>
means of isobutane flushing means 30. When different conduits 4 are provided for connecting<br>
the mixing vessel 3 to the reactor 1, generally, one conduit having one active pumping means<br>
5 will be operative, while the other conduits 4 and pumping means 5 will not be operative but<br>
will be kept in stand by mode. In this latter case, the conduit 4 downstream the pump 5 will<br>
preferably be flushed with a suitable stream of diluent The conduit 4 upstream the pump 5<br>
may be discontinuously flushed. In addition, two-way valves 31 can be installed on the<br>
conduits 4, in order to never stop the pumping means 5.<br>
It is important to correctly control the metallocene catalyst flow rate to the reactor and to<br>
pump catalyst slurry into the reactor at a controlled and limited f low rate. An unexpected flow<br>
rate to the reactor could lead to a runaway reaction. A fluctuating flow to the reactor could<br>
lead to reduced efficiency and fluctuations in product quality. Therefore, in a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment, the injection pump 5 flow rates are controlled by the reactor 1 activity.<br>
The pumping means are in particular controllable in function of the concentration of a reactant<br><br>
in said reactor. Preferably said reactant is the concentration of monomer, i.e. ethylene, in the<br>
reactor. However, it should be clear that the membrane pumps are controllable in function of<br>
the concentration of other reactants, such as e.g. the co -monomer or hydrogen<br>
concentrations in the reactor as well. By the use of membrane pumps 5 the invention<br>
provides for a good control catalyst flow. In particular, the metallocene catalyst flow rate to<br>
the reactors is controlled by adjusting the stroke and/or frequency of the membrane pumps.<br>
Furthermore, the pump flow rates are controlled by the ethylene concentratio n in the reactor.<br>
In case the ethylene concentration is high in the reactor, more catalyst will be added to the<br>
reactor and vice versa. In this way, the variations in ethylene polymerisation rate are taken<br>
into account and actual production rate and produc t properties do not fluctuate significantly.<br>
Variations in ethylene polymerisation rate are taken into account and polymerisation reactions<br>
under optimal catalyst feeding conditions can be obtained.<br>
At the start of the operation of the above-described embodiment of an apparatus according to<br>
the invention, the following subsequent steps are performed. First, the mixing vessel 3 and<br>
the conduits provided under the valves 9 are filled with the diluent isobutane. Then, the<br>
storage vessels and the conduits 6 a nd connecting lines 6, provided upstream the valves 9,<br>
are supplied with isobutane. Subsequently, the valves 9 are shortly brought into operation,<br>
where after the flushing to the reactor 1 is opened and catalyst is injected through conduits 4<br>
in the reactor.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to an apparatus for preparing and supplying<br>
catalyst to a polymerisation reactor comprising<br>
a (storage) vessel suitable for containing concentrated catalyst slurry comprising<br>
catalyst solid particles suspe nded in a mineral oil,<br>
a buffer vessel for diluting said catalyst slurry at a suitable concentration for use in a<br>
polymerisation reaction, said buffer vessel being in connection with said (storage) vessel by<br>
means of one or more conduits for transferring the concentrated catalyst slurry from said<br>
(storage) vessel to the buffer vessel and being provided with one or more conduits suitable<br>
for transferring the diluted catalyst slurry from said buffer vessel to said reactor,<br>
a pump provided on each of said con duits for transferring catalyst slurry from said<br>
vessel to said buffer vessel and<br>
a pump provided on each of said conduits for transferring diluted catalyst slurry from<br>
said buffer vessel to said reactor.<br><br>
The above-referred embodiment of an apparatus ace ording to the present invention is<br>
particularly suitable for being used for different types of catalysts, e.g. for chromium -type,<br>
metallocene as well as Ziegler -Natta catalysts, and in particular for catalyst which is provided<br>
as solid particles suspended in a mineral oil.<br>
The present embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention enables to transfer<br>
concentrated catalyst slurry from the storage vessel to the buffer vessel before supplying the<br>
slurry to the reactor. Therefor, in another preferred em bodiment, an apparatus is provided<br>
according to the invention wherein a pump is provided on the conduit for transferring<br>
concentrated catalyst slurry from the storage vessel to the buffer vessel which preferably<br>
comprises a progressive cavity pump. Such ty pe of pump is particularly suitable for pumping<br>
significant amounts of solids, e.g. catalyst solid particles in mineral oil.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides an apparatus that enables to adjust catalyst flow to<br>
said reactor in function of the polymerisation reaction in said reactor. Therefor, i n another<br>
preferred embodiment, the pump provided on the conduit for transferring the diluted catalyst<br>
slurry from said buffer vessel to said reactor comprises a membrane pump. Such pumps<br>
have the advantage that they allow the control of catalyst flow rate. Furthermore, such pumps<br>
can in particular be regulated in function of the concentration of a reactant in said reactor. Via<br>
a feed back mechanism, the membrane pumps are capable of being adjusted and of fin e-<br>
tuning the catalyst flow rate to the reactor in function of the concentration of a reactant in said<br>
reactor.<br>
In addition, the present apparatus has the advantage to be usable for different batches of<br>
catalyst. The apparatus does not need to be replaced every time a new commercial vessel<br>
comprising catalyst is to be connected to the system.<br>
As mentioned above, the present embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention is<br>
particularly suitable for being used for different types of catalysts, e.g. for chromium-type,<br>
metallocene as well as Ziegler -Natta catalysts. This embodiment of the invention will however<br>
be described hereunder with reference to a method and apparatus for supplying a Ziegler -<br>
Natta catalyst, in particular a titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) catalyst to a polymerisation reactor<br>
wherein ethylene is polymerised. As co -catalyst for the Ziegler-Natta catalyst, reference is<br><br>
made to a tri-isobutyl aluminium co-catalyst. However, it should be clear that the present<br>
apparatus is applicable to other types of catalysts and co-catalysts as well, as indicated<br>
above.<br>
Referring to FIG.3 a preferred embodiment of an apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is illustrated. In general, the apparatus according to the invention comprises a<br>
vessel 2 for receiving catalyst in oil suspension, and a buffer vessel 3 for preparing and<br>
storing diluted catalyst slurry at a suitable concentration for use in a polymerisation reaction.<br>
Concentrated catalyst slurry is transferred from the vessel 2 to the buffer vessel 3 through<br>
one or more conduits 40 by means of pumps 50, while diluted catalyst slurry is continuously<br>
transferred from the buffer vessel 3 to the reactor through one or more conduits 4 by means<br>
of pumps 5. The constructional details of valves, pumps etc. have been omitted in the<br>
drawings for clarity, it being within the skill of the art to supply these.<br>
According to the present invention, the Ziegler -Natta catalyst TiCl4 is provided as a<br>
suspension of solid particles in a mineral oil or hexane or h eptane in a commercially available<br>
drum. It can also be supplied in dry form. The catalyst can be transferred to a vessel 2 from<br>
this commercial drum. According to an embodiment, the catalyst can be provided from such<br>
commercial drums to vessel 2 by means of nitrogen pneumatic transfer or by gravity. The<br>
catalyst concentration in vessel 2 can be adjusted by adding mineral oil; alternatively other<br>
hydrocarbons can be used.<br>
In general, the pressure in the vessel 2 may comprise approximately between 7 and 16 bar.<br>
The slurry in the vessel 2 is referred to as "concentrated" or "heavy" slurry since it contains a<br>
proportionally high amount of particulate catalyst solids. Such concentration preferably<br>
ranges from 10 to 50 % by weight, and even more preferred from 2 0 to 40 % by weight.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the concentrated Ziegler -Natta catalyst is transferred<br>
from vessel 2 to the buffer vessel 3, wherein the catalyst is diluted to a concentration suitable<br>
for use in the polymerisation reactor. The buffer vessel 3 therefore is provided with means 34<br>
for supplying a suitable diluent to said buffer vessel 3. The concentrated catalyst supplied to<br>
the buffer vessel 3 through conduit 4 is diluted by the diluent supplied through conduit 34 to<br>
obtain diluted catalyst slurry in the buffer vessel 3. The buffer vessel 3 can be operated either<br>
when full of liquid or not Preferably, the buffer vessel 3 is operated when full of liquid, since if<br><br>
there is an interphase with nitrogen the catalyst slurry might stick to the walls settle in the<br>
vessel.<br>
When using TiCl4 as catalyst, hydrocarbons such as hexane or isobutane can be used to<br>
dilute the catalyst and to obtain diluted catalyst slurry. However, a major disadvantage of<br>
using hexane as diluent to prepare the c atalyst is that a portion of hexane generally ends up<br>
in the final polymer product, which is undesirable. Isobutane on the other hand is easier to<br>
handle, to purify and to re -use in the polymerisation process than hexane. For instance, since<br>
in the polymerisation process of ethylene, isobutane is applied as diluent in the reaction,<br>
isobutane used as diluent for the catalyst can easily be re -used in the polymerisation process.<br>
Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, isobutane is used as diluent for the TiCI 4 catalyst<br>
Isobutane is generally present in gas form at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure.<br>
In other to obtain liquid isobutane for preparing the diluted catalyst slurry, the buffer vessel 3<br>
is preferably operated at pressure levels comprised betw een 8 and 17 bar, and preferably at<br>
pressure levels comprised between 4 and 5 bar. The pressure in the buffer vessel 3 is<br>
preferably lower than the pressure in the reactor, in order to avoid leakage of catalyst from<br>
the buffer vessel to the reactor.<br>
Before transferring the Ziegler-Natta catalyst from the vessel 2 to the buffer vessel 3,<br>
isobutane is admitted into the vessel 3. The vessel 3 is provided with an inlet system 34 for<br>
supply of this diluent The vessel 2 and the buffer vessel 3 are agitated by means of stirring or<br>
mixing means 25 provided in said vessel to maintain the homogeneity of the concentrated<br>
and diluted catalyst slurry, respectively. The buffer vessel 3 is preferably large enough to<br>
contain sufficient catalyst slurry and large enough su ch that a day vessel capacity is<br>
equivalent to the time to prepare a new batch. This enables to assure the continuous<br>
production and availability of the catalyst in the polymerisation reaction. Alternatively, a<br>
second vessel 2 can be provided to prepare a new batch.<br>
The slurry in the buffer vessel 3 is referred to as "diluted" slurry since it contains a<br>
proportionally low amount of particulate catalyst solids. The diluted slurry has a concentration<br>
comprised between 0.1 and 10 % by weight, and preferably c omprised between 0.1 and 5 %<br>
by weight, and even more preferred between 0.S and 4 % by weight. Preparing diluted<br>
catalyst slurry having these concentrations advantageously enables the further use of<br>
diaphragm pumps 5 for injecting the diluted catalyst slur ry in the reactor 1, as described into<br><br>
more detail below. In case other concentrations of catalyst slurry would be applied, it is clear<br>
that other types of pumps can be applied.<br>
The transfer of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst from the vessel 2 to the buffer ve ssei 3 is preferably<br>
done through one or more conduits 4 0. For transfer of Ziegler-Natta catalyst from the vessel 2<br>
to the buffer vessel 3 a pump 5 0 is provided on each conduit 4 0. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
said pump 50 comprises a pump which is suitable for pumping liquids with significant<br>
amounts of solids, e.g. solid particles in crude oil, which would otherwise easily damage more<br>
common types of reciprocating oil well pumping systems. Examples of pumps of this type are<br>
commonly known as Moineau pumps o r progressive cavity pumps, and are available<br>
commercially. Such progressive cavity pumps operate on the Moineau principle, which is<br>
based on the geometrical fit between the rotating element (rotor), and the stationary element<br>
(stator). The interference fi t between the rotor and the stator creates a series of sealed<br>
chambers called cavities. Pumping action is achieved by the rotor turning eccentrically within<br>
the stator. Fluid enters the cavity formed at the inlet and progresses within that cavity to the<br>
outlet. The result is a positive displacement, non -pulsating flow that is directly proportional to<br>
the pump's speed. This allows the progressive cavity pump to deliver material at a wide range<br>
of flow rates from small shots to continuous flow.<br>
As represented in FIG. 3, the conduits 40 preferably leave the vessel 2 in upward direction<br>
under an angle preferably superior to 10°, and more preferably superior to 30°. In addition,<br>
the conduits 40 provided downwards the pumping means 5 0 conducts the catalyst slurry<br>
preferably downwardly, under an angle preferably superior to 10°. Such configuration<br>
improves the action of the pump 5 0 and also enables to avoid plugging in the pump 5 0 since<br>
under this configuration the concentrated catalyst slurry tends to settle away from the pumps<br>
SO in case the pumps 5 0 are interrupted or stopped.<br>
The conduits 4 0 are further preferably provided with a pulsation dampener, safety valves and<br>
isobutane flushing means 300, 333, either at the inlet, at the outlet or at both sides of the<br>
slurry pumps 50, as illustrated on FIG. 3. Isobutane flushing means 300; 330 enable to flush<br>
isobutane diluent through the conduit 4 0 and to keep the conduits 40 and the pumps 50<br>
unplugged. On conduits 300, 330 for injecting isobutane flow measuring means c an be<br>
provided. When different conduits 4 are provided for connecting the vessel 2 to the buffer<br><br>
vessel 3, generally, one conduit having one active pump 5 0 will be operative, while the other<br>
conduits 40 and pumps 5 0 will not be operative but wilt be kept i n stand by mode.<br>
The concentrated slurry is preferably injected in ratio control of isobutane diluent to catalyst in<br>
the buffer vessel to have a constant concentration of slurry in the buffer vessel. In addition,<br>
the conduits 40 can be further provided with flow measuring means for easily measuring the<br>
flow rate of the concentrated catalyst slurry in the conduits 4 0. The ratio of catalyst to diluent<br>
is adequately controlled and adjusted by controlling the speed of the pump 5 0 and by<br>
measuring the density of the isobutane diluent<br>
Catalyst wastes can be sent through conduit 37, which is provided with a valve 39, to one or<br>
more dump vessels 38, which are preferably provided with stirring means and contain mineral<br>
oil for neutralization and elimination of the wastes. Preferably said dump vessel 38 is larger<br>
than the buffer vessel 3. In case of the preparation of unsuitable catalyst, these can be<br>
emptied from the vessels 3 to these dump vessels 38. The dump vessel 3 8 is preferably a<br>
heated vessel, having a s team jacket, where the diluent, i.e. isobutane, is evaporated. The<br>
steam jacket is preferred, for desorbing isobutane. The evaporated diluent is sent to<br>
distillation or to the flare. In order to avoid the transfer of catalyst fragments when transferring<br>
the evaporated diluent, guard filters are provided with the dump vessels 38. The dump<br>
vessels 38 are also provided with pressure controlling means for controlling the pressure in<br>
said vessels. The catalyst waste remaining after evaporation of the diluent is removed from<br>
the vessels 38, preferably by means of a draining system, provided at the bottom of the<br>
vessel 38, and the removed waste is discharged into drums and further destroyed.<br>
The diluted Ziegler-Natta catalyst slurry is subsequently transferred from the buffer vessel 3<br>
to the reactor 1 through one or more conduits 4. The conduits 4 preferably have an inner<br>
diameter comprised between 0.3 and 2 cm, and preferably between 0.6 and 1 cm. Each<br>
conduit 4 is provided with a pump 5, which controls the transfer and injection of the diluted<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst slurry into the reactors 1. In a particularly preferred embodiment, said<br>
pumps are diaphragm pumps.<br>
As represented in FIG. 3, the conduits 4 preferably leave the buffer vessel 3 upwardly under<br>
an angle preferably superior to 10*. and more preferably superior to 30". In addition, the<br>
conduit 4 provided downwards file pump 5 conducts the diluted catalyst slurry downwardly,<br><br>
under an angle preferably superior to 10°. Such configuration improves the action of the<br>
pump 5 and also enables to avoid plugging in the pump 5 since under this configuration the<br>
diluted catalyst slurry tends to settle away from the pumps 5 in case the pumps 5 are<br>
interrupted or stopped.<br>
The conduits 4 are further provided with a put sation dampener, safety valves and isobutane<br>
flushing means 30,33 either at the inlet, at the outlet or at both sides of the diaphragm pumps<br>
5. Isobutane flushing means 30, 33 enable to flush isobutane through the conduit 4 and to<br>
keep the conduits 4 and the pump 5 unplugged. Preferably, there is continuous flushing of the<br>
conduit 4 downstream the membrane pump 5 to the reactor 1 by means of isobutane flushing<br>
means. The conduit 4 upstream the pump 5 may be flushed discontinuously, by means of<br>
isobutane flushing means. When different conduits 4 are provided for connecting the buffer<br>
vessel 3 to the reactor 1, generally, one conduit having one active pumps 5 will be operative,<br>
while the other conduits 4 and pump 5 will not be operative but will be kept in s tand by mode.<br>
In this latter case, the conduit downstream the pump 5 will preferably be flushed with a<br>
suitable stream of diluent. The conduit upstream the pump 5 may be discontinuously flushed.<br>
In order to reduce the risk of leakage, the catalyst should be stored at a lower pressure than<br>
the reactor that is generally comprised around 43 bar, e.g. stored in the buffer vessel 3 at<br>
approximately 6-16 bar. The pressure in the cond uits 4 downstream of the pumps 5 is<br>
preferably comprised between 45 and 65 bar. This elevated pressure, in comparison with the<br>
pressure values provided in the vessel 2 and the buffer vessel 3, is required in order to bring<br>
the diluted catalyst under sufficient pressure into the reactor.<br>
It is important to control correctly the cataly st flow to the reactor and to pump catalyst slurry<br>
into the reactor at a controlled and limited flow. An unexpected flow to the reactor could lead<br>
to a runaway reaction. A fluctuating flow to the reactor could lead to reduced efficiency and<br>
fluctuations in product quality. Therefore, in a particularly preferred embodiment, the injection<br>
pump 5 flow rates are controlled by the reactors' 1 activity. The pumps are in particular<br>
controllable in function of the concentration of a reactant in said reactor. Prefer ably said<br>
reactant is the concentration of monomer, i.e. ethylene, in the reactor. However, it should be<br>
clear that the membrane pumps are controllable in function of the concentration of other<br>
reactants, such as e.g. the co -monomer or hydrogen concentrati ons in the reactor as well. By<br>
the use of membrane pumps 5 the invention provides for a good control of the diluted catalyst<br><br>
flow. In particular, the catalyst flow rate to the reactors is controlled by adjusting the stroke<br>
and/or frequency of the diaphragm pumps. Furthermore, the pump flow rates are controlled<br>
by the ethylene concentration in the reactor. In case the ethylene concentration is high in the<br>
reactor, more catalyst will be added to the reactor and vice versa. In this way, the variations<br>
in ethylene polymerisation rate are taken into account and actual production rate and product<br>
properties do not fluctuate significantly.<br>
In a further embodiment, the apparatus according to the present invention is further provided<br>
with a co-catalyst distribution system, for bringing a suitable amount of co-catalyst into<br>
contact with the catalyst slurry f or a suitable period of time before supplying said catalyst<br>
slurry to said reactor. When using a metallocene catalyst, tri isobutyl aluminium (TIBAL) is<br>
preferably used as co-catalyst-. When using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, tri isobutyl aluminium<br>
(TIBAL) is preferably used as co -catalyst.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 or FIG. 3, the co -catalyst distribution system 11 may comprise two co -<br>
catalyst storage vessels wherein co -catalyst is prepared and stored. One vessel may be in<br>
connection to the conduit 4 for providing co -catalyst thereto.<br>
Co-catalyst wastes can be sent to a dump vessel, which is preferably provided with stirring<br>
means and contains mineral oil for neutralizatio n and elimination. The dump is provided with<br>
a heated vessel, e.g. steam jacket, where the isobutane is evaporated and sent to distillation<br>
or to the flare.<br>
Co-catalysts are generally provided in commercial drums. In a storage vessel of the co -<br>
catalyst distribution system 11, the TIBAL co-catalyst is generally provided in a solution of<br>
hexane or heptane, but can be provided in pure form too. The TIBAL co -catalyst is<br>
transferred from the storage vessel through a co -catalyst injection conduit 12, in the con duit<br>
4, which connects the mixing vessel 3 with the reactor 1. Conduit 12 intersects conduit 4,<br>
downstream the diaphragm pumps 5 and upstream the reactor 1. In case a flow measuring<br>
means 10 is further provided on the conduits 4, the co -catalyst feeding conduit 12 preferably<br>
intersects the conduit 4, downstream of said flow meter 10 and upstream the reactor 1.<br>
The contact time between the Ziegler -Natta / metallocene catalyst and the TIBAL co -catalyst<br>
znd the ratio between the Ziegler-Natta / metallocene catalyst and the TIBAL co -catalyst have<br><br>
an important influence on the granulometry but also on the activity of the final polymerisation<br>
product. Using a TIBAL oo -catalyst, bigger polyethylene particles can be obtained through<br>
activity. Also, pre-contact of the TIBAL co-catalyst with the catalyst improves the bulk density<br>
and the settling efficiency of the polyethylene prepared in the polymerisation reactor.<br>
According to the invention a suitable amount of TIBAL co -catalyst is injected in the conduits<br>
4, downstream the diaphragm pumps 5, before entering the reactors 1.<br>
In case the TIBAL co-catalyst is injected in the conduit 4, the injection point is at a distance<br>
from the reactor allowing a certain pre -contact time with the catalyst before being supplied to<br>
the reactor. In order to have a sufficient pre -contact time, preferably between 5 seconds and<br>
1 minute, between the metallocene catalyst slurry and the TIBAL co -catalyst, each conduit 4<br>
is provided with a contact vessel 13, preferably downstream the injectio n point of the co-<br>
catalyst distribution system, for enhancing the contact time of said co -catalyst with said<br>
catalyst slurry in the conduits 4. These contact vessels 13 can be agitated or not In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the conduits 4 have an inner d iameter comprised between 0.3 and 2<br>
cm, and preferably comprised between 0.6 and 1cm while the diameter of the contact vessels<br>
13 is preferably comprised between 1 and 15 cm and preferably between 6 and 9 cm.<br>
In addition, in various embodiments of an ap paratus according to the invention conduits 4 are<br>
provided which are further provided with measuring means 10, for easily measuring the<br>
catalyst flow rate in the conduits 4. These flow measuring means 10 preferably are Coriolis<br>
flow measuring means. The me ans 10 can be provided between the mixing vessel 3 and the<br>
membrane pumps 5 or downstream from said pumping means 5. Preferably, said means 10<br>
are provided upstream of the co -catalyst injection conduit 11. The slurry is preferably injected<br>
in ratio control of isobutane diluent to catalyst. The ratio of catalyst to diluent is adequately<br>
controlled and adjusted by controlling the speed of the pump 5 and by measuring the density<br>
of the isobutane diluent. The Coriolis meters 10 can measure the flow and the densi ty of the<br>
catalyst slurry at the exit of the mixing vessel 3 and indirectly determine the suspended solids<br>
concentration. A correlation exists for estimating the concentration of suspended solids based<br>
on the slurry density, the earner fluid density and t he solid particle density.<br>
In another embodiment, measuring means 10, and preferably Coriolis flow measuring means,<br>
can also be provided in conduits 40 between the storage vessel 2 and the mixing vessel 3,<br>
i.e. upstream or downstream of the membrane pump s 50 in these conduits 40.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the catalyst slurTy is injected under controlled flow rate into the<br>
reactor. The conduits 4 for transferring catalyst slurry into to the reactor are equipped by one<br>
or more valves, preferably piston valve s 22. The piston valves 22 are capable of sealing the<br>
orifice by which the conduit 4 is connected to the reactor 1. When using different conduits 4<br>
for transferring catalyst slurry to one reactor, only in one conduit 4 the pumps actively pump<br>
catalyst slurry to the reactor, while in other conduits 4 the pumps are not active and the<br>
conduits are preferably flushed by isobutane.<br>
For reasons of brevity and clarity, conventional auxiliary equipment such as pumps, additional<br>
valves, and other process equipment have not been included in this description and the<br>
accompanying drawings as they play no part in the explanation of the invention. Also<br>
additional measurement and control devices which would typically be used on a<br>
polymerization process have not been illu strated.<br>
It is clear from the present description that numbers and dimensions of the different parts of<br>
the apparatus according to the present invention relate to the size of the polymerisation<br>
reactors and can be changed in function of the reactor sizes .<br>
In another preferred embodiment, by operation in accordance with the present invention, all<br>
lines, vessels, pumps, valves, etc.. can be kept free of clogging by means of flushing or<br>
purging with nitrogen or diluent, i.e. isobutane. It is to be understood that where necessary<br>
flushing and purging means and lines are available on the device according to the invention<br>
in order to avoid plugging, or blocking.<br>
It is clear from the present description that numbers and dimensions of the different parts of<br>
the apparatus according to the invention relate to the size of the polymerization reactors and<br>
can be changed in function of the reactor sizes.<br>
It is to be understood from the present invention that all indicated pressures values are<br>
preferred pressure values, which in general can deviate from the indicated pressure values<br>
with approximately + 1 bar. It will be evident from the present description that all indicated<br>
pressure values in the vessels, conduits, etc.. are values that are lower than the pressure<br>
value in the polymerisation reactor.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that all lines or conduits applied in<br>
accordance with the present invention may be provided, where necessary with flow<br>
measuring means.<br>
The apparatuses according to the invention can be applied for feeding a single polymerisation<br>
reactor. In a preferred embodiment the apparatus according to the invention is applied for<br>
feeding a polymerisation reactor consisting of two liquid full loop reactors, comprising a first<br>
and a second reactor connected in series by one or more settling legs of the first reactor<br>
connected for discharge of slurry from the first reactor to said second reactor. Such in series<br>
connected reactors are particularly suitable for the preparation of b imodal polyethylene. The<br>
present apparatus can be applied for both reactors. The number of conduits 4 can be divided<br>
between the first and the second reactor. It is also possible to use two or more apparatuses<br>
according to the invention, e.g. when two or m ore different catalysts are used. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the apparatus according to the invention can be used in a single loop reactor as<br>
depicted on FIG. 4 or in a double loop reactor, as depicted on FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 4 represents a single loop reactor 1 00, consisting of a plurality of interconnected pipes<br>

means for example of a piston or set of rotating impellers 103. The reactor 100 is further provided with one or more settling legs 109 connected to the pipes 104 of the reactor 100.<br>
The settling legs 109 are preferably provided with a n isolation valve 110. These valves 110<br>
are open under normal conditions and can be closed for example to isolate a settling leg from<br>
operation. Further the settling legs can be provided with product take off or discharge valves<br>
111. The discharge valve discharge of polymer slurry, when it is fully open. Polymer slurry<br>
settled in the settling legs 109 may be removed by means of one or more product recovery<br>
lines 113, e.g. to a product recovery zone.<br><br>

116, which are interconnected in series. Both reactors 100, 116 consist of a plurality of<br>
interconnected pipes 104. The vertical 111 may be any type of valve, which can permit<br>
continuous or periodical sections of the p ipe segments 104 are preferably provided with heat<br>
jackets 105. Reactants are introduced into the reactors 100 by line 107. Catalyst, optionally in<br>
conjunction with a co-catalyst or activation agent, is injected in the reactor 100 or 116 by<br>
means of the conduct 106. The polymerization slurry is directionally circulated throughout the<br>
loop reactors 100,116 as illustrated by the arrows 108 by one or more pumps, such as axial<br>
flow pump 101. The pumps may be powered by an electric motor 102. The pumps may be<br>
provided with a set of rotating impellers 103. The reactors 100,116 are further provided with<br>
one or more settling legs 109 connected to the pipes 104 of the reactors 100, 116. The<br>
settling legs 109 are preferably provided with an isolation valve 110. Furt her the settling legs<br>
can be provided with product take off or discharge valves 111. Downstream the valve 111 at<br>
the exit of the settling leg 109 of reactor 100, a three -way valve 114 is provided which allows<br>
to transfer polymer slurry settled in the sett ing legs 109 to the other reactor 116, by means of<br>
the transfer line 112. The transfer line 112 connects the three -way valve 114, provided at the<br>
exit of the settling leg 109 of one reactor 100, with the entry in the other reactor 116, where<br>
preferably a piston valve 115 is provided. Polymer slurry settled in the settling legs 109 of<br>

The present invention further relates to methods for optimising the supply of a catalyst slurry<br>
to a polymerisation reactor wherein polyethylene, and preferably bimodal polyethylene, is<br>
prepared.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for controlling the injection of<br>
catalyst slurry in a polyme rization reactor 1 wherein polyethylene is prepared, said catalyst<br>
consisting of solid catalyst, preferably a metallocene catalyst defined as described above in a<br>
hydrocarbon diluent, preferably isobutane. However, it is clear that the present method is al so<br>
suitable for controlling the injection of chromium catalyst slurry in a polymerization reactor 1.<br>
The method comprises the subsequent steps of: a) providing solid catalyst and a<br>
hydrocarbon diluent in one or more storage vessels 2 such that a catalyst s lurry is obtained in<br>
said vessel 2, b) transferring said catalyst slurry from said storage vessel 2 to a mixing vessel<br><br>
3 wherein said catalyst slurry is diluted for obtaining a suitable concentration for use in a<br>
polymerisation reaction, and c) pumping said diluted catalyst slurry at a controlled flow rate<br>
from said mixing vessel 3 to said polymerisation reactor 1 through one or more conduits 4, by<br>
means of a pumping means 5, provided in each of said conduits 4. Such method is<br>
particularly suitable for opti mising the supply of metallocene or chromium cataly st to a<br>
polymerisation reactor 1.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment as illustrated on FIG. 1, the method comprises<br>
transferring said catalyst slurry from a storage vessel 2 to a mixing vessel 3 at a con trolled<br>
flow rate, by controlling the ratio between diluent and catalyst in the mixing vessel 3. Control<br>
of the flow rate is enabled by providing a catalyst feeding system for feeding catalyst slurry<br>
from the storage vessel 2 to the mixing vessel 3, which comprises a conduit 6, 7, connected<br>
to said vessel 2 and metering valves 9, preferably ball check feeder or shot feeder valves , on<br>
said conduit 6, 7. The catalyst flow from the storage vessel 2 to the mixing vessel 3 is<br>
regulated by the valves 9 and is dep endent on the dosed amount (concentration) of catalyst<br>
and diluent in the mixing vessel 3. The ratio between diluent and catalyst is adequately<br>
controlled. This is enabled by adequate control of catalyst supply from the storage vessel 2<br>
by means of the cat alyst feeding system and metering valves 9, and by release of a suitable<br>
amount of isobutane diluent in the mixing vessel 3 through conduits 24. The amount of<br>
isobutane diluent can also be controlled using the catalyst concentration determined from the<br>
density measurement by Coriolis meter 10.<br>
In another embodiment as illustrated on FIG. 3, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
optimising catalyst supply to a polymerisation reactor 1 comprising the steps of a) transferring<br>
concentrated catalyst slu rry from a vessel 2 to a buffer vessel 3, said concentrated catalyst<br>
slurry comprising catalyst solid particles suspended in a mineral oil, b) diluting said catalyst<br>
slurry in said buffer vessel 3 by supplying a suitable diluent in said buffer vessel 3 whe reby<br>
diluted catalyst slurry is obtained having a suitable concentration for use in a polymerisation<br>
reaction, and c) transferring said diluted catalyst slurry from said buffer vessel 3 to said<br>
reactor 1 at a suitable flow rate. Such method is particularly suitable for optimising the supply<br>
of Ziegler-Natta catalyst TiCI4 to a polymerisation reactor 1, whereby the Ziegler -Natta<br>
catalyst TiCl4 is provided in a commercial container 2 and transferred to vessel 3 as a<br>
suspension of solid particles in a mineral oil. The methods according to the present invention<br><br>
comprise the step of transferring concentrated catalyst slurry from a vessel 2 to a buffer<br>
vessel 3 through conduits 4 0 provided with pumps 5 0, preferably progressive cavity pumps.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the method s according to the present invention comprise<br>
diluting the catalyst slurry to a suitable concentration with hydrocarbon diluent, preferably<br>
isobutane, in the mixing vessel 3 to a concentration comprised between 0.1 and 10 % by<br>
weight and more preferred having a concentration comprised between 0.1 and 5 % by weight,<br>
and even more preferred between 0.5 and 4 % by weigh. For instance the slurry is diluted in<br>
a hydrocarbon diluent to a concentration comprised between 0.1 and 4 % by weight and more<br>
preferred between 0.1 % and 1.0 % by weight, and even more preferred of 0.5 % by weight.<br>
Preparing diluted slurry having these concentrations advantageously enables the further use<br>
of membrane pumps (diaphragm pumps) 5 for injecting the slurry in the reactor 1. The use of<br>
such pumps advantageously enables to precisely and adequately control the flow of catalyst<br>
slurry injection in the reactor. The amount of isobutane diluent can be controlled using the<br>
catalyst concentration determined from the den sity measurement by Coriolis meter 10.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the methods according to the present invention also comprise<br>
diluting the catalyst slurry to a suitable concentration with hydrocarbon diluent, preferably<br>
isobutane, by injecting said diluent in the conduits connecting the storage vessel 2 with the<br>
mixing vessel 3. According to this embodiment, the concentrated catalyst slurry is diluted<br>
while being transferred from the storage vessel to a mixing vessel, wherein the diluted<br>
catalyst is maintained and optionally further diluted.<br>
In another embodiment, the method s according to the invention comprise controlling the Mow<br>
rate of the catalyst slurry to the reactor 1 by determining the concentration of a reactant in<br>
said reactor 1. Preferably sa id reactant is the concentration of monomer, i.e. ethylene, in the<br>
reactor. However, it should be clear that also determination of other reactants, such as e.g.<br>
the co-monomer or the diluent concentrations in the reactor, is comprised within the scope of<br>
the present invention. Practically, this mechanism is obtained by providing each conduit for<br>
transferring and supplying the catalyst slurry from the buffer vessel to the reactor with a<br>
membrane pump that is capable of being adjusted and regulating the catal yst flow rate in<br>
function of the concentration of a reactant in said reactor.<br><br>
In certain cases it might be required or advantageous to bring the catalyst into contact with a<br>
co-catalyst, as indicated above. Therefore, the present inven tion further provides methods<br>
comprising the step of bringing a co -catalyst into contact with said catalyst slurry before<br>
supplying said catalyst slurry to said reactor. The present methods provide a better contact<br>
and formation of a co-catalyst-catalyst mixture then in the case when co-catalyst is directly<br>
supplied to a reactor. Supply of a suitable co -catalyst-catalyst mixture to the reactor provides<br>
a more controlled and more uniform level of polymerisation reactivity in the reactor. Also, pre -<br>
contact between catalyst and co-catalyst positively influences the granulometry of the final<br>
polymerisation product and improves the bulk density and the settling efficiency of the<br>
polymerisation product prepared in the polymerisation reactor. Such method s also enable to<br>
more preoisel y control the ratio of catalyst -co-catalyst injection.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method s comprise bringing a co -catalyst, preferably a co -<br>
catalyst as defined above, into contact with said diluted catal yst slurry present in conduits 4.<br>
The co-catalyst distribution system 12 preferably comprises at least one storage vessel and a<br>
conduit 11 intersecting the conduit 4, as illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 . In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the method s further comprise enhancing the contact time and the pre -contact of<br>
said co-catalyst with said catalyst slurry in conduits 4, by locally enhancing the volume of said<br>
conduits 4. Pre-contact between catalyst and co-catalyst positively influences the<br>
granulometry of the final polymerisation product and improves th e bulk density and the<br>
settling efficiency of the polymerisation product prepared in the polymerisation reactor. During<br>
the activation process, if too much co -catalyst contacts the catalyst particle, the catalytic<br>
activity is not only reduced, but actual h arm may result. The present method s also<br>
advantageously enable to more precisely control the ratio of catalyst/co -catalyst injection. By<br>
locally enhancing the volume of the conduits, a better pre -contact between co-catalyst and<br>
catalyst is obtained. The lo cal enhancement of the volume is obtained by providing a contact<br>
vessel 13 in each conduit 4. Said vessels 13 have a diameter with is considerably larger than<br>
the diameter of the conduits 4.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides methods for continuously<br>
supplying catalyst slurry from the buffer vessel 3 to the reactor 1 through conduits 4 at a<br>
suitable flow rate. The present invention provides methods that enable to continuously supply<br>
catalyst to a reactor, without interruption o f the catalyst flow. By this mechanism continuous<br><br>
supply of catalyst slurry without relevant fluctuations to a polymerisation reactor is ensured,<br>
which will increase the efficiency of the polymerisation reaction in the reactor.<br>
In yet another preferred em bodiment, the invention relates to methods wherein catalyst flow<br>
rate to the reactor is accurately measured, through liquid flow rate measurement, using flow<br>

Examples<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following example of a production on a commercial -<br>
scale double loop reactor. For the comparative example a conventional catalyst feed system<br>
and control were used. The use of the current invention allows the polymerization reactor to<br>
be run at higher slurry densities with less variation than with conventional catalyst feeding<br>
control. The lower standard deviations indicate that the present invention allows for improved<br>
control of the polymerization process and thus higher product consistency.<br><br><br><br>
