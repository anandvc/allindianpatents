				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
ThisinventionrelatestotricyclicS.e-dihydro-QH-pyrazolofS^-cJ-l^^-triazolo^.S-or]pyridines which are selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) type IV or the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and as such are useful in the treatment of asthma, arthritis, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airways disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis and other inflammatory diseases as well as AIDS, sepsis, septic shock and other diseases, such as cachexia, involving the production of TNF. Compounds of the present invention may have combined PDE IV and TNF inhibitory activity.<br>
This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of the above diseases in mammals, especially humans and to pharmaceutical compositions useful therefor.<br>
Since the recognition that cyclic AMP is an intracellular second messenger (E.W. Sutherland, and T. W. Rail, Pharmacol. Rev.. 1960, 12, 265), inhibition of the phosphodiesterases has been a target for modulation and, accordingly, therapeutic intervention in a range of disease processes. More recently, distinct classes of PDE have been recognized (J.A. Beavo and D. H. Reifsnyder, TiPS. 1990, H, 150), and their selective inhibition has led to improved drug therapy (C.D. Nicholson, R. A. Challiss and M. Shahid, TiPS. 1991,12,19). More particularly, it has been recognized that inhibition of PDE type IV can lead to inhibition of inflammatory mediator release (M.W. Verghese et al.. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol., 1989, 12 (Suppl. II), S 61) and airway smooth muscle relaxation (T. J. Torphy in Directions for New Anti-Asthma Drugs, eds S. R. O'Donnell and C. G. A. Persson, 1988, 37, Birkhauser-Verlag). Thus, compounds that inhibit PDE type IV, but which have poor activity against other PDE types, inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators and relax airway smooth muscle without causing cardiovascular effects or antiplatelet effects.<br>
TNF is recognized to be involved in many infectious and auto-immune diseases, including cachexia (W. Friers, FEBS Letters. 1991, 285. 199). Furthermore, it has been shown that TNF is the prime mediator of the inflammatory response seen in sepsis and septic shock (C.E. Spooner et al., Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology. 1992, 62, S11).<br>

BIOLOGICAL ASSAY Human Eosinophil PDE4<br>
Human peripheral blood is collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, diluted 1:2 in piperazine-N,N'-bis-2-ethanesulfonic acid (PIPES) buffer and then layered over percoll solution. Gradients are formed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4°C. The remainder of the isolation procedure, which is based on the procedure of Kita et al., J. Immunol., 152. 5457 (1994), is carried out at 4°C. The neutrophil/eosinophil layer is collected from the percoll gradient and the red blood cells are lysed. Remaining cells are washed in PIPES (1% PCS), incubated with anti-CDI6 microbeads (MACS) for 1 hour, and passed over a magnetic column to remove the neutrophils. Eosinophils are collected in the eluate and analyzed for viability by trypan blue and purity by diff-quick stain. Eosinophil purity is routinely greater than 99% using this method.<br>
Purified eosinophils are resuspended in 750µL of PDE lysis buffer (20 mM triethylamine, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 100 µg/ml bacitracin, 2mM benzamidine, 50µM leupeptin, 50µM PMSF, 100µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and quick frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells are thawed slowly and sonicated. Membranes are<br>
vortexed (disruption is confirmed by Trypan blue staining of fragments). Disrupted cells are centrifuged at 45k rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C to isolate membranes. Cytosol is decanted, and membrane resuspended to 200 µg/ml for use as PDE source in the hydrolysis assay yielding a window from 3000 to 5000 counts.<br>
Compounds are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10-2M, then diluted 1:25 in water to 4 x 104 M. This suspension is serially diluted 1:10 in 4% dimethyl sulfoxide, for a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration in the assay of 1%. PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITION ASSAY<br>

TNF<br>
The ability of the compounds or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof to inhibit the production of TNF and, consequently, demonstrate their effectiveness for treating diseases involving the production of TNF is shown by the following in vitro assay:<br>
Peripheral blood (100 mis) from human volunteers is collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Mononuclear cells are isolated by Ficoll/Hypaque and washed three times in incomplete Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Cells are resuspended in a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells per ml in pre-warmed RPMI (containing 5% PCS, glutamine, pen/step and nystatin). Monocytes are plated as 1 x 106 cells in 1.0 ml in 24-well plates. The cells are incubated at 37°C (5% carbon dioxide) and allowed to adhere to the plates for 2 hours, after which time non-adherent cells are removed by gentle washing. Test compounds (10µl) are then added to the cells at 3-4 concentrations each and incubated for 1 hour. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10µI) is added to appropriate wells. Plates are incubated overnight (18 hrs) at 37°C. At the end of the incubation period TNF was analyzed by a sandwich ELISA (R&amp;D Quantikine Kit). IC50 determinations are made for each compound based on linear regression analysis.<br>
Pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, those formed with HCI, HBr, HNO3, H2S04, H3P04, CH3SO3H, p-CH3C6H4S03H, CH3CO2H, gluconic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid and succinic acid. Pharmaceutically-acceptable cationic salts of the compounds of this invention of formula I wherein R5 is CO2R6 and R6 is hydrogen include, but are not limited to, those of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine (meglumine), ethanolamine and diethanolamine.<br>
For administration to humans in the curative or prophylactic treatment of inflammatory diseases, oral dosages of the compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (hereinafter also referred to as the active compounds of the present invention) are generally in the range of from 0.1-400 mg daily for an average adult patient (70 kg). Thus for a typical adult patient, individual tablets or capsules contain from 0.1 to 50 mg of active compound, in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier. Dosages for intravenous administration are typically within the range of 0.1 to 40 mg per single dose as required. For intranasal or inhaler administration, the dosage is generally formulated as a 0.1 to 1% (w/v) solution. In practice the physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case but<br>
there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and all such dosages are within the scope of this invention.<br>
For administration to humans for the inhibition of TNF, a variety of conventional routes may be used including orally, parenterally and topically. In general, the active compound will be administered orally or parenterally at dosages between about 0.1 and 25 mg/kg body weight of the subject to be treated per day, preferably from about 0.3 to 5 mg/kg. The compound of formula I can also be administered topically in an ointment or cream in concentrations of about 0.5% to about 1%, generally applied 2 or 3 times per day to the affected area. However, some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject.<br>
For human use, the active compounds of the present invention can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in an admixture with a pharmaceutical diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovales either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. They may be injected parenterally; for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances; for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic.<br>
