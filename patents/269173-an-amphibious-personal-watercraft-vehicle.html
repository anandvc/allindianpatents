AN AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE<br>
The present invention relates to an amphibious vehicle and<br>
in particular, to a sit-astride amphibious vehicle having all-<br>
terrain vehicle (ATV) capability on land.<br>
Amphibious vehicles are now well known in the art.<br>
However, the present applicant has identified a need for an<br>
amphibious vehicle having ATV capability on land and which<br>
performs as a high speed personal watercraft on water. A number<br>
of prior art proposals have proceeded to prototype. However,<br>
such vehicles have opted to either optimise operation in the<br>
marine mode or, alternatively, operation in the land mode. The<br>
result is an amphibious vehicle having poor performance in one<br>
mode of operation or the other.<br>
Sit astride amphibious vehicles have previously been<br>
described such as in US 5690046 to Grzech. Grzech teaches an<br>
amphibious tricycle. The problem identified by the inventor in<br>
this document, was to provide his personal watercraft (PWC) with<br>
limited on land capability in order that it was at least<br>
partially mobile when going ashore. GRZECH is limited in that it<br>
is only suitable for travel on well made up roads when operating<br>
in a land mode.  This is because the vehicle has only three<br>
wheels and these are connected to the remainder of the vehicle<br>
by a suspension arrangement which is adapted to cope only with<br>
smooth road surfaces and does not have the suspension travel<br>
suitable for off-road use of the vehicle.  Also, GRZECH needs a<br>
large heat exchanger which protrudes through the keel of the<br>
vehicle to provide the very necessary cooling required to cool<br>
the highly overpowered marine combustion engine.  This dictates<br>
against off-road land use since the heat exchanger could easily<br>
be damaged in such a use.  GRZECH has opted for a single<br>
steerable front wheel since this is easiest to provide in an<br>
adaptation of a personal watercraft.<br>
Accordingly, there exists the need for an all terrain high<br>
speed amphibian vehicle, more particularly, having at least four<br>
retractable wheel assemblies.<br><br>
WO 2006/043088	PCT/GB2005/004079<br>
-	*?       -<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides an<br>
amphibious vehicle comprising:<br>
a sit-astride seat,<br>
a planing hull,<br>
at least four wheels, each of which is movable between an<br>
extended land mode location and a retracted water mode location,<br>
two of the wheels being front steerable wheels, which are, at<br>
least in the land mode of the vehicle, connected to handlebars<br>
which can be operated by a driver to steer the vehicle,<br>
an engine which in the land mode of the vehicle is<br>
connected to at least one of the wheels to drive the wheel, and<br>
marine propulsion means to propel the vehicle on water.<br>
GRZECH only seeks to provide a PWC with a limited on-land<br>
function; he has taken an existing PWC and adapted it with few<br>
changes.  GRZECH teaches that the engine can be connected to the<br>
driven wheels through a transmission with one fixed gear ratio.<br>
In a second aspect the present invention provides an<br>
amphibious vehicle comprising:<br>
a sit-astride seat<br>
a planing hull,<br>
at least four wheels, each of which is movable between an<br>
extended land mode location and a retracted water mode location,<br>
at least two of the wheels being front steerable wheels, which<br>
are, at least in the land mode of the vehicle, connected to<br>
handlebars which can be operated by a driver to steer the<br>
vehicle,<br>
an engine which in the land mode of the vehicle is<br>
connected to at least one of the wheels to drive the wheel, and<br>
marine propulsion means to propel the vehicle on water.<br>
GRZECH in adapting a PWC has sought to keep the overall<br>
dimensions of the vehicle within those of an existing PWC; thus<br>
he has chosen rear wheels on a trailing arm suspension with a<br>
track width less than the hull beam and also a single<br>
retractable front wheel.<br><br>

wheels, which are, at least in the land mode of the vehicle,<br>
connected to handlebars which can be operated by a driver to<br>
steer the vehicle,<br>
an engine which in the land mode of the vehicle is<br>
connected to at least one of the wheels to drive the wheel, and<br>

connected to at least one of the wheels to drive the wheel, and<br>
marine propulsion means to propel the vehicle on water,<br>
wherein:<br>
the planing hull is formed as a single component and the<br>
vehicle has one or more deck components all joined to the hull<br>
component along a join line which extends around an entire<br>
periphery of the vehicle at a level above a water line of the<br>
vehicle in water; and<br>
the or at least one of the deck components forms a<br>
majority of an upwardly facing surface of the vehicle and is<br>
demountable to allow access to the engine located there beneath.<br>
In a fifth aspect the present invention provides an<br><br>

two of the wheels being front steerable wheels of the vehicle,<br>
which are, at least in the land mode of the vehicle, connected<br>

the engine is mounted on a frame releasably connected to<br>
the hull, the vehicle also comprising a transmission connecting<br>
the engine to the driven wheel(s), at least part of the<br>
transmission also being mounted on the frame.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention provides an<br>
amphibious vehicle comprising:<br>
a sit-astride seat,<br>
a vehicle body having a planing hull,<br>
at least four wheels, each of which is movable between an<br>
extended land mode location and a retracted water mode location,<br>

apart on both sides of the sit-astride seat with the vehicle<br>
body having sill portions positioned laterally outside the<br>
footwell areas.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described by way of example only with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which;<br><br>

Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, there can be seen an<br>
amphibious vehicle 10 having a forward bow end 12 and a rear<br>
stern end 14.<br>
The vehicle 10 has four road wheels 50,51,52,53 which are<br>
connected to the remainder of the vehicle by a wheel suspension<br><br>

system which includes a wheel retraction mechanism for moving<br>
the wheels 50,51,52,53 between a lowered state for road use and<br>
a raised state for marine use.  The front wheels 50 and 53 are<br>
steerable and handlebars 54 enable steering of these wheels.<br>
The rear wheels 51,52 are driven to propel the vehicle on land.<br>
A jet drive unit 55 (see Figure 2) provides propulsion in marine<br>
use.<br>
The structure of the amphibious vehicle 10 comprises an<br>
upper deck section 30 and a lower hull section 40. The upper<br>
deck structure 30 is sealed to the lower hull section 40 around<br>
a peripheral planar edge which is above the water line when the<br>
amphibious vehicle 10 is displaced in water -(as can best be<br>
seen in Figures 5 and Figures 8). The complete upper deck<br>
section 30 is detachable from the lower hull section 40 as a<br>
single unit; this permits ease of access to internal components<br>
of vehicle for servicing, etc.<br>
Air inlet openings 31 provide an entry for cooling air<br>
(e.g. fan-assisted) for use by the cooling systems of the<br>
amphibious vehicle 10. Air entrained via inlets 31 is eventually<br>
exhausted via outlets 32. Between air inlet 31 and air outlet<br>
32, a dorade system is installed to prevent the ingress of<br>
water. The dorade system facilitates righting of the vehicle on<br>
water by use of a labyrinthine air inlet passage system to<br>
prevent the ingress of water should the amphibious vehicle 10 be<br>
inverted in use in the marine mode. Sit-astride seats 33 and 34<br>
are provided for a driver and a passenger of the amphibious<br>
vehicle 10. A footwell area 35 is provided either side of the<br>
sit-astride seats 33, 34, each shrouded by bodywork positioned<br>
laterally outside of the footwell area 35 to provide protection.<br>
These footwell areas 35 may be provided with means to bail<br>
automatically any water shipped in use of the amphibious vehicle<br>
10.<br>
Front and rear wheel arches 36, 37 are provided on either<br>
side of the amphibious vehicle 10 so as to contain a retractable<br>
wheel assembly which is retracted when the amphibious vehicle 10<br>
is operating in the marine mode. An instrument panel 3 8 is<br><br>
WO 2006/043088	PCT/GB2005/004079<br>
-     7   -<br>
provided ahead of the steering controls to convey relevant<br>
parameters of the amphibious vehicle 10 to the driver.<br>
Additionally, rear view mirrors (not shown) may be provided as a<br>
visual aid to the driver. Furthermore, navigation lights may<br>
also be provided within or on the upper deck structure 30 in<br>
accordance with the local legislative requirements.<br>
The upper deck structure 3 0 forms an integral part of the<br>
entire structure of the vehicle.  It is a structural component<br>
and not merely cladding.  Typically it will take the form of a<br>
composite structure (e.g. glass fibres or carbon fibres set in<br>
resin) although any suitable manufacturing method may be<br>
employed. Where localised areas of strength are required in the<br>
upper deck structure 30, extra layers or mats of fibres may be<br>
laid down during manufacture.  The deck 30 will be formed with<br>
localised reinforced areas in order to provide a complete force<br>
transmitting path extending around the vehicle in a complete<br>
circle in a plane orthogonal to a longitudinal axis of the<br>
vehicle, in order to provide resistance to torsional loads on<br>
the vehicle.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2 and 4 the underside of the hull<br>
can be seen extending from the front bow section 12 to the rear<br>
stern section 14. Starting from the planar interface with the<br>
upper deck section 30, there is a relatively shallow section 41<br>
extending around a periphery of the amphibious vehicle 30 and in<br>
this section there are provided front and rear wheel arches 42,<br>
43. These areas of the hull provide stability when the<br>
amphibious vehicle 10 is operated at high speed in marine mode<br>
because they provide enclosed volumes spaced laterally from the<br>
centre line of the amphibious vehicle 10. As such, when<br>
cornering sharply, for example, an increase in righting force is<br>
experienced as the angle of lean increases. The bodywork lateral<br>
of the footwell areas could be provided with buoyancy inserts<br>
which would provide righting forces spaced from the vehicle<br>
centre line when the vehicle corners on water.<br>
Cutouts are provided in the hull on either side of the<br>
centre line of the vehicle in the region of the front and rear<br><br>
WO 2006/043088	PCT/GB2005/004079<br>
-     8   -<br>
wheel arches 42, 43 to provide slots through which the<br>
retractable wheel assemblies can be protracted and retracted.<br>
Suitably profiled covers 44, 45 are provided as part of the<br>
wheel assemblies so as to reconstruct the lines of the hull when<br>
the wheel assemblies are retracted for use in marine mode.<br>
A lower V section 46 depends from the mid section 41 and<br>
is provided with a keel section running from the bow 12 of the<br>
amphibious vehicle to approximately halfway along the length of<br>
the vehicle. At this point, the keel splits to incorporate a<br>
water intake area 49 for a jet drive marine propulsion unit of<br>
the amphibious vehicle 10. The design of the hull 40 is critical<br>
in determining the performance achieved when the amphibious<br>
vehicle 10 is operated in the marine mode.<br>
The present applicants have spent considerable time and<br>
effort in the design of the hull 40 which has resulted in a<br>
rather surprising shape in that usually expected for a planing<br>
water craft. The dead rise angle of the hull is substantially<br>
20.7 degrees along substantially its entire length. This<br>
compares with traditional planing hulls which start at the bow<br>
section with a very steep dead rise angle and these dead rise<br>
angles become more shallow along the length of the hull towards<br>
the stern, typically ending at 5 degrees or less of dead rise<br>
angle.<br>
Since the seating of the vehicle is arranged<br>
longitudinally along the vehicle, the vehicle is narrower than a<br>
passenger car.  Aligning the engine longitudinally along the<br>
vehicle gives a body shape which is narrow in beam and deep.<br>
Rather than adopting the flat planing hull common in the prior<br>
art, the applicant has adopted a greater dead rise angle for the<br>
agile marine handling this provides, accepting that this gives a<br>
need for a suspension with a lot of travel to give adequate<br>
ground clearance on land.  Large wheels also enable off-road<br>
usage, although they give problems of packaging.  Whereas before<br>
vehicles such as that of GRZECH strove to keep the track width<br>
of the wheels within the beam of the vehicle, the applicant has<br>
realised that better land mode operation can be achieved if the<br><br>
WO 2006/043088	PCT/GB2005/004079<br>
-     9   -<br>
track width of the vehicle is greater than the beam of the hull.<br>
The approach adopted by the applicant does mean that wheels must<br>
be retracted through a large angle in order to be clear of the<br>
vehicle waterline in marine use, but the strategy does provide<br>
for a vehicle capable both on land and on water.<br>
The hull 40 is additionally provided with hydrodynamic<br>
aids in the form of strakes 47, 48 and the profiled suspension<br>
arm covers 44, 45 previously referred to. Even with the small<br>
footprint of the hull of the amphibious vehicle 10, the hull<br>
design 40 is capable of propelling the amphibious vehicle 10 up<br>
onto the plane with little difficulty in fast time periods.<br>
Furthermore, on-water performance of the amphibious vehicle 10<br>
is not compromised and adequate ground clearance is available in<br>
operating the amphibious vehicle 10 in land mode as an all<br>
terrain vehicle.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates location of the major internal<br>
components of the amphibious vehicle 10.<br>
In Figure 8 there can be seen a prime mover 60 which is a<br>
multi-cylinder internal combustion engine.  It is connected by a<br>
transmission 61 to drive the rear wheels 51,52 during land use<br>
of the vehicle and to drive the jet drive unit 55 during marine<br>
use.  As described in other applications of the applicant the<br>
jet drive unit is permanently connected to the engine 60 to be<br>
driven thereby at all times, whilst the wheels 51 and 52 are<br>
connected to the engine 52 only in their lowered land use<br>
positions.<br>
In Figure 8 it can be seen that the handlebars 54 are<br>
connected by a steering column 62 to a steering mechanism 63 for<br>
steering the front wheels 50,53 of the vehicle which is<br>
described in detail in another application of the applicant.<br>
Spring and damper assemblies 64,65,66,67 are provided in-board<br>
for the wheels 50,51,52,53.  Two wheel retraction hydraulic<br>
actuators (which cannot be seen in the Figure) are provided, one<br>
for the front wheels 50,53 and one for the rear wheels 51,52 to<br>
allow the wheels to be retracted from their lowered positions<br><br>
WO 2006/043088	PCT/GB2005/004079<br>
-     10   -<br>
shown in Figure 8 to their raised positions.  These hydraulic<br>
actuators will be powered by hydraulic fluid supplies from a<br>
pump (not shown) powered by the engine 60.<br>
The seating in the vehicle is provided substantially above<br>
the vehicle powertrain, with the handlebars located roughly<br>
halfway along the length of the vehicle, this comparing with<br>
traditional PWC designs which locate the handlebars roughly two<br>
thirds along the length of the vehicle (measured from the back).<br>
This gives a good weight distribution for both marine and land<br>
use.<br>
The powertrain components illustrated in Figure 8, i.e.<br>
the engine 60, the transmission 61 are built up on a frame<br>
platform which is then connected to the hull; this gives<br>
considerable advantage for ease of manufacture.  Indeed it is<br>
envisaged that a chassis could be constructed with a frame<br>
supporting all of the wheel suspension components, the wheel<br>
steering mechanism, the wheel retraction mechanism, the engine<br>
60 and the transmission 61.  This would considerably aid<br>
construction and repair.  This is illustrated in Figure 19 where<br>
a rolling chassis 300 of the vehicle can be seen stripped of the<br>
surrounding hull and deck sections.  In the Figure there can be<br>
seen the engine, the transmission 61 as well as the suspension<br>
assemblies for the front and rear wheels and radiators 70, 302<br>
of the cooling system of the vehicle, all mounted to a common<br>
supporting structure 303.<br>
The radiator 70 can also be seen in Figure 8 located at<br>
the front of the vehicle which will cool the vehicle's engine,<br>
at least in land use.  The vehicle's engine can also be cooled<br>
by a water/water heat exchanger (not shown) in marine use, with<br>
water being drawn from beneath the vehicle to cool water used by<br>
the engine cooling system.<br>
The transmission 61 comprises an output shaft 71 leading<br>
drive from the engine to a gearbox 72 which has two output<br>

a continuously variable transmission arrangement, the pulleys<br>
75,76 of which can be seen in Figure 8 and which is shown<br>
schematically in Figure 20.  As shown in Figure 20, the<br>
continuously variable transmission has a vertically extending<br>
output shaft 400 which extends downwardly to a differential 401<br>
through which drive is relayed to the rear wheels 51,52.  The<br>
CVT transmission 61 could be replaced in other embodiments by a<br>
conventional automatic gearbox or a manual gearbox.<br>
Figures 9 to 11 show the front steering and suspension<br>
assemblies of the vehicle.  A frame 101 has swingably mounted to<br>
it left and right suspensions 103 and 105 as seen from the rear<br>
of the vehicle.<br>
Each suspension 103 and 105 comprises an upright member<br>
107 (see Figure 10) connected to a lower suspension arm 109 and<br>
an upper wishbone 111.  wheels 50 and 53 (shown in Figure 1) are<br>
each mounted to a hub 114, which is rotatably carried on upright<br>
member 107.<br>
Extending from each of the upright members 107 is a<br>
steering arm 117 (see especially Figure 9) to which is pivotally<br>
connected a track rod extension 119 at its outer end 121.  The<br>
inner end of extension 119 is connected to a track rod 123.  The<br>
track rod 123 is moved transversely by means of link 125 which<br>
is connected to a swingable connection 127 on steering column<br>
129.<br>
An actuator 141 having piston rod 143 acts on one arm of<br>
swing arm 13 7 to pivot the arm, the outer ends of which are<br>
connected to piston rods 144 of suspension dampers 145 (see<br>
Figures 10 and 11), which are surrounded by coil springs 146.<br>
The base of each damper 145 is connected at 147 to retraction<br>
arm 14 9 pivotally mounted at 151 to frame 101. On retraction the<br>
suspension swings about an axis running fore and aft<br>
longitudinally along the vehicle; a torsion tube 151 rotates and<br>
the lower suspension arm 109 rotates with it (compare figures 10<br>
and 11).<br><br>
