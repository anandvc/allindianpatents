				<td>METHOD OF PROVIDING SERVICE WHICH MAKES POWER DISTRIBUTION<br>
OPERATION EFFECTIVE, AND SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to the service for<br>
increasing the efficiency in the power distribution business<br>
and its system by means of minimizing the electric power loss<br>
in the power distribution system or by implementing the plant<br>
and equipment investment effectively for the power distribution<br>
system.<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, the efficiency increase in the power<br>
distribution operation or the economical operation of the power<br>
distribution operation have depended heavily on the subjective<br>
judgment of the operator. In general, as the power distribution<br>
companies give priority to the reliability of the power<br>
distribution system or the reliability of the electric power<br>
supply rather than its economical operation, it is fact that<br>
the performance and effect in the economical operation has not<br>
verified explicitly.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is general that the efficiency increase in the power<br>
distribution operation is provided as a part of the power<br><br>
distribution efficiency increasing system, in which a<br>
relatively large scale investment on the plant and equipment<br>
including the introduction of the remote-operated circuit<br>
breakers and switches and sensors is assumed.<br>
[0004]<br>
In connection with the power liberalization movement, the<br>
importance of strengthening of the baseline of the management<br>
operation increases for the power distribution companies. It<br>
is commonly recognized that the optimization of the plant and<br>
equipment investment and the cost reduction of the electric<br>
power supply are specifically prime tasks among other things.<br>
[0005]<br>
And furthermore, as described above, the efficiency<br>
increase in the power distribution operation conventionally<br>
depended heavily on the subjective judgment of the operator and<br>
the performance and effect in the economical operation has not<br>
verified explicitly, which makes an insecure business model.<br>
[0006]<br>
In addition, a relatively large scale investment on the<br>
plant and equipment is inevitable for increasing the efficiency<br>
in the power distribution operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing service and a power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing system which enables to<br>
increase the operation of the power distribution without plant<br>
and equipment investment and to verify explicitly its effect<br>

baseline of the management operation of the power distribution<br>
company.<br>
[0008]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing service of the present<br>
invention comprises a means for planning the optimum power<br>
distribution system to be established with initial investment<br>
by the service provider, a means for providing a consultation<br>
for increasing the efficiency in the power distribution, a means<br>
for introducing the system for measuring the revenue money<br>
obtained by the power distribution efficiency increasing<br>
service and a means for measuring the usage rate of the optimized<br>
power distribution system.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition, in order to attain the above object, the power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing system of the present<br>
invention comprises a measuring device of the purchased power<br>
of the power distribution company, a means for transmitting the<br><br>

information of the power distribution system to the service<br>
provider, a means for receiving the measured data, a computer<br>

individually, and that the effect brought by the power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing service is estimated based<br>
on the difference between the pre-introduction electric power<br>

power distribution company.<br>
[0014]<br>
In addition, it is preferable that the service provider<br>
provides a consultation service for increasing the power<br>
distribution efficiency. In this case, the consultation service<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019]<br>
Now, referring to FIG. 1 to 3, the present invention is<br>
disclosed in the preferred embodiment. At first, modification<br>
of the power distribution system pattern is described with the<br>
preferred embodiments.<br>
[0020]<br>
According to this embodiment, the efficiency of the power<br>
distribution system is increased in the following method. By<br>
modifying the open and close pattern of the circuit breakers<br>
or the switches in the power distribution system, an optimum<br>
pattern of the power distribution system making the electric<br>
loss minimized can be obtained without altering the condition<br>
for supplying the electric power to the electric power<br>
customers.<br>
[0021]<br>
FIG. 1 shows an example of a part of the power distribution<br><br>
system to which the efficiency increasing service of this<br>
embodiment is applied, in which what is shown is a part of the<br>
patterned power distribution system comprising power<br>
distribution substation transformer si (= BANK01, 02 ...),<br>
section switches 2 (= TYS01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 ...),<br>
cooperating switches 3 (= TL01 ...) and feeder circuit breakers<br>
4 (= FCB01, 02 ...).<br>
[0022]<br>
The electric power purchased from the power generation<br>
company is supplied from the primary side of the power<br>
distribution substation transformer 1 and its voltage is made<br>
reduced and then, the electric power flows into the power<br>
distribution system through the feeder circuit breakers 4. The<br>
section switches 2 and the cooperating switches 3 in the power<br>
distribution system have their own open-circuit state or<br>
closed-circuit state individually, and define a specific<br>
pattern of the power distribution system.<br>
[0023]<br>
FIG. 2 shows a route for supplying the electric power to<br>
the load 5 in a given power distribution system pattern. The<br>
electric power is supplied to the load 5 through the route<br>
starting at BANK02 in the power distribution substation<br>
transformer 1 connected next to FCB02 as the feeder circuit<br>
breaker 4, connected next to TYS04 as the section switch 2,<br><br>
connected next to TYS05 as the section switch and finally<br>
through TYS07 as the section switch.<br>
[0024]<br>
FIG. 3 shows another example of the route for supplying<br>
the electric power to the load 5 in a given power distribution<br>
system pattern defined by modifying the open and close state<br>
of the section switches 2 different from the example shown in<br>
FIG. 2. More specifically, in the power distribution system in<br>
FIG. 3 compared to what shown in FIG. 2, in which TYS05 as the<br>
section switch 2 is turned from the closed-circuit state to the<br>
open-circuit state and TYS06 as the section switch is turned<br>
from the open-circuit state to the closed-circuit state,<br>
resultantly, the electric power is supplied to the load 5<br>
through the route starting at the BANK01 in the power<br>
distribution substation transformer 1 connected next to FCB01<br>
as the feeder circuit breaker 4, connected next to TYS01 as the<br>
section switch 2, connected next to TYS02 as the section switch,<br>
connected next to TYS03 as the section switch, connected next<br>
to TL01 as the cooperating switch 3, connected next to TYS06<br>
as the section switch 2 and finally through TYS07 as the section<br>
switch.<br>
[0025]<br>
Comparing the case of supplying the electric power<br>
through the route shown in FIG. 2 with the case of supplying<br><br>
the electric power through the route shown I FIG. 3 , it is proved<br>
that the electric loss in the individual route differs from each<br>
other due to the difference in the impedance of the power<br>
distribution cable and the distance between the power source<br>
to the load. To obtain an optimum power distribution system<br>
enabling to minimize the power distribution loss is equivalent<br>
to select a single pattern for minimizing the power distribution<br>
loss among several patterns, each having an individual<br>
combination of open and closed states of the circuit breakers<br>
and the switches in the power distribution system in the area<br>
covered by a given service. As the calculation for selecting<br>
an optimum pattern by using a computer consumes an extended time<br>
period, it is general to apply such a method as Genetic Algorithm<br>
(GA algorithm) in order to obtain an approximate solution in<br>
a shorter time period.<br>
[0026]<br>
For the supplementary note, the functions of the section<br>
switch 2 and the cooperating switch 3 are described here. Both<br>
of the section switch 2 and the cooperating switch 3 are switches<br>
operating on an electric circuit and have an identical electric<br>
function. Their difference is only determined by their<br>
positions placed in the electric circuit. Their operational<br>
roles change in connection with their positions.<br>
[0027]<br><br>
As for the section switches 2, the electric power<br>
customers are connected to the individual branches in the power<br>
distribution system configured in a tree structure (in which<br>
only a single route is established between the power source to<br>
the individual electric power customer (load)), in which the<br>
section switch is located so as to form an individual<br>
small-sized group of customers. For example, in urban areas,<br>
the distribution system is divided into a set of sections by<br>
the section switches, each arranged for 3 to 10 customers.<br>
Though all the customers (loads) are not illustrated explicitly<br>
in such a figure as shown by FIG. 1 in general, plural customers<br>
are connected practically to the sections before and after the<br>
individual section switch. In the power distribution system<br>
configured in a tree structure, once the section switch is<br>
turned OFF, the electric power to be supplied to the customers<br>
located in the down stream of this section switch is broken down.<br>
In a practical operation, when an accident occurs in the power<br>
distribution system, the cooperating switches are combined in<br>
order to minimize the area of power failure.<br>
[0028]<br>
The cooperating switch 3 is a switch for coupling the<br>
sections of the power distribution system configured in a tree<br>
structure, and is normally turned OFF in Japan. When the<br>
cooperating switch is turned ON, there may occur such a case<br><br>
that several sections form a loop. This means that plural power<br>
supply routes are formed from the power source to the customer.<br>
Owing to this configuration, the reliability in the power supply<br>
can be increased. In a example of using the cooperating switch,<br>
the cooperating switch is normally turned OFF, and in case that<br>
an accident in the power distribution system occurs, the<br>
disabled section due to the accident is isolated by the section<br>
switches and then the cooperating switch is turned ON, which<br>
makes it possible to supply the electric power from the another<br>
section in the branching power distribution system to the<br>
operable sections located in the down stream of the disabled<br>
section due to the accident.<br>
[0029]<br>
It is difficult to establish several alternative routes<br>
from the power source to the customer only by using the section<br>
switches. As alternative power distribution patterns can be<br>
established by supplying the electric power from the other power<br>
sources through the cooperating switches, what can be obtained<br>
is such a pattern of switches individually turned OFF or OFF<br>
as minimizing the power distribution loss can be minimized.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the method of one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the electric power volume purchased from the power generation<br>
company by the power distribution company before and after<br><br>
introducing the power distribution efficiency increasing<br>
service; the profit money obtained by introducing the power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing service is calculated based<br>
on the difference between the electric power volume before and<br>
after its introduction; the profit money is divided based on<br>
the contract concluded between the power distribution company<br>
and the service provider or the service charge is paid from the<br>
power distribution company to the service provider.<br>
[0031]<br>
At first, before introducing the power distribution<br>
efficiency increasing service, the purchased electric power to<br>
be distributed to the service area of the distribution company<br>
is measured in a given time period. Next, the purchased electric<br>
power is measured in a given time period after introducing this<br>
service. The effect of this service is defined as the reduced<br>
volume of the purchased electric power for the power<br>
distribution company by comparing the pre-service operation<br>
with the post-service operation.<br>
[0032]<br>
The given time period described above is defined to be<br>
long enough to insensitive to the changes in the power demand<br>
due to days of week, seasons and/or unscheduled events. This<br>
given time period is defined to be one year in the following<br>
description.<br><br>
[0033]<br>
Though the effect obtained by the power distribution<br>
efficiency increasing service can be calculated based on the<br>
result of measuring the electric power volume purchased by the<br>
power distribution company as described above, the electric<br>
power demand (or the electric power volume purchased by the<br>
power distribution company) changes irregularly and annually<br>
due to the climatic conditions and the increase and decrease<br>
in the number of customers in general. This change should be<br>
considered in calculating the effect obtained by the power<br>
distribution efficiency increasing service.<br>
[0034]<br>
By referring to FIG. 4, one embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described. FIG 4 is a work flow showing a basic<br>
configuration of the power distribution efficiency increasing<br>
service.<br>
[0035]<br>
The contract for the power distribution efficiency<br>
increasing service is concluded between the power distribution<br>
company 1010 and the service provider 1009. The power<br>
distribution company 1010 purchases (1013) the electric power<br>
from the power generation company 1012 and pays (1014) the<br>
retail sales electricity bills to the power generation company<br>
1012. In addition, the power distribution company 1010 sells<br><br>
(1007) retail of the electric power to the electric power<br>
customer 1011, and collects (1008) the electricity bills. If<br>
the power distribution company 1010 increases the efficiency<br>
in the power distribution operation, the electric power volume<br>
purchased from the power generation company can be reduced<br>
without making effect to the power supply to the electric power<br>
customer 1011. In other words, it can be interpreted<br>
qualitatively that the wholesale electricity bills to be paid<br>
to the power generation company 1012 can be reduced without<br>
sacrificing the collected amount of electricity bills from the<br>
electric power customers 1011, and that the cost reduction can<br>
be realized in the power distribution operation.<br>
[0036]<br>
The service provider 1009 initially invests (1004)<br>
initial capital for the plant and equipment to the power<br>
distribution company 1010 according to the contract concluded<br>
between the power distribution company 1010 and the service<br>
provider 1009. The initial capital investment (1004) to the<br>
plant and equipment covers the measuring system for measuring<br>
the effect obtained by the power distribution efficiency<br>
increasing service, the construction of the equipment data base<br>
and the installation of the computer system for calculating an<br>
optimum power distribution system pattern, which will be<br>
described later.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
In addition, the service provider 1009 provides (1001)<br>
the consultation for increasing the power distribution<br>
efficiency, and the power distribution company 1010 implements<br>
the operation for increasing the power distribution efficiency<br>
and feeds back (1003) its operation information to the service<br>
provider 1009. The measured values for the electric power volume<br>
purchased from the power generation company 1012 is collected<br>
(1002) by the service provider 1009. The service provider 1009<br>
calculates the profit money obtained by increasing the power<br>
distribution efficiency from the above information, and<br>
notifies (1005) it to the power distribution company 1010. The<br>
service provider 1009 receives (1006) the divided money<br>
corresponding to this profit money or the fixed service charge<br>
from the power distribution company 1010.<br>
[0038]<br>
FIG. 5 is a system configuration diagram illustrating one<br>
mode of the embodiment of the present invention. The electric<br>
power generated at the power generation facility 2001 of the<br>
power generation company 1012 is supplied to the power<br>
transforming facility 2005 of the power distribution company<br>
through the power distribution line 2002, and then supplied from<br>
the power distribution system facility 2006 to the electric<br>
power customer 1011 through the power distribution line 2003.<br><br>
[0039]<br>
The power distribution system supervisory and control<br>
system 2007 supervises and controls the power distribution<br>
system facility 2006 and the power transforming facility 2005<br>
in the power distribution company 1010. The operation<br>
information of the power distribution system facility 2006 is<br>
stored in the power distribution system supervisory and control<br>
system 2007. The electric power volume purchased from the power<br>
generation company 1012 by the power distribution company 1010<br>
is measured by the purchased electric power measuring system<br>
2004. The operation information of the power distribution<br>
system facility 2 006 and the measurement data of the purchased<br>
electric power measuring system 2004 are transmitted<br>
periodically to the service provider through the communication<br>
unit 2010, and the public network or the private network 2011.<br>
[0040]<br>
The service provider 1009 has the communication unit 2009<br>
and receives the data from the power distribution company 1010.<br>
In addition, the service provider has the computer 2008, in<br>
which an optimum power distribution system pattern is<br>
calculated, the usage rate of the optimized power distribution<br>
system and the profit money obtained by the optimization is<br>
calculated.<br>
[0041]<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing the information flow<br>
in one embodiment of the power distribution efficiency<br>
increasing service in the present invention<br>
[0042]<br>
In the power distribution company 1010, the power<br>
distribution system supervisory and control system 2007<br>
supervises and controls the power distribution system by using<br>
the facility information data base 3008, and the operation<br>
information is stored in the facility information data base 3008.<br>
The data of the purchased electric power volume obtained by the<br>
purchased electric power measuring system 2004 are transmitted<br>
to the service provider 1009 through the communication units<br>
2010 and 2009.<br>
[0043]<br>
In the service provider 1009, the estimated value of the<br>
usage rate of the optimized power distribution system is<br>
calculated 3003 based on the data received by the communication<br>
unit 2009 and the result of the calculation 3002 for estimating<br>
the optimum power distribution system pattern. The calculation<br>
3002 for estimating the optimum power distribution system<br>
pattern is based on the facility information stored in the<br>
facility information data base. The facility information<br>
includes the impedance of the power distribution lines and the<br>
position or distance information of the loads, the circuit<br><br>
breakers and the switches in the individual power distribution<br>
systems. The information stored in the facility information<br>
data base 3008 is supplied in an on-line or off-line mode to<br>
the calculation 3002 for estimating the optimum power<br>
distribution system pattern at the service provider 1009. The<br>
data obtained by the calculation 3002 for estimating the optimum<br>
power distribution system pattern are stored in an on-line or<br>
off-line mode into the facility information data base 3008 and<br>
then used for operating the power distribution system.<br>
[0044]<br>
The calculation 3001 for estimating the profit money<br>
obtained by optimization is executed based on the data obtained<br>
by the calculation 3003 for estimating the usage rate of the<br>
optimized power distribution system and the operation<br>
information of the power distribution system and the purchased<br>
electric power volume received through the communication unit<br>
2009.<br>
[0045]<br>
FIG 7 is a flow chart showing a procedural flow of the<br>
power distribution increasing service in the embodiment<br>
illustrating one mode of the present invention. At first, the<br>
service provider 1009 surveys and studies the purchased<br>
electric power volume of the power distribution company and its<br>
power distribution system configuration, and forecasts the<br><br>
profit to be obtained by introducing the service (Step i). Next,<br>
the service provider 1009 provides the power distribution<br>
company 1010 with the consultation for introducing this service<br>
(Step ii). Next, the contract for this service is concluded<br>
(Step iii).<br>
[0046]<br>
After concluding the contract, the system for measuring<br>
the effect obtained by increasing the power distribution<br>
efficiency is installed (Step iv). Next, the consultation for<br>
increasing the power distribution efficiency is provided to the<br>
power distribution company by the service provider 1009.<br>
[0047]<br>
Next, the power distribution company implements the<br>
operation for increasing the power distribution efficiency<br>
(Step vi), and then the usage rate of the optimized power<br>
distribution system provided by the service provider and the<br>
effect obtained by increasing the power distribution efficiency<br>
are measured (Step vii).<br>
[0048]<br>
Thereafter, whether the optimized power distribution<br>
system was used in a contracted usage rate or more is judged<br>
(Step viii), and if the usage rate does not reach a designated<br>
value, the profit money obtained by the service is divided<br>
appropriately as contracted between the power distribution<br><br>
company 101 and the service provider 1009, or the power<br>
distribution company 1010 pas the service charge to the service<br>
provider 1009 (Step ix). If the usage rate reaches or exceeds<br>
a designated value, the profit money obtained by the service<br>
is divided approximately as contracted between the power<br>
distribution company 101 and the service provider 1009, or the<br>
power distribution company 1010 pas the service charge to the<br>
service provider 1009.<br>
[0049]<br>
Though thee outline of the power distribution efficiency<br>
increasing service and the power distribution efficiency<br>
increasing system is described above, what will be described<br>
concretely below is a method for correcting the measured value<br>
of the electric power volume purchased from the power generation<br>
company 1012 by the power distribution company 1010 and<br>
estimating the effect of the service.<br>
[0050]<br>
Assume that the number of the power distribution<br>
substations located in the area covered by the service is n.<br>
Plural substations extracted randomly from the power<br>
distribution substations located in this service area or<br>
located in the areas adjacent to this service area are called<br>
base stations. Assume that the number of the base stations is<br>
m. The service is not applied to m base stations. In this<br><br>
condition, the electric power inflow into m base stations does<br>
not change before and after introducing the service, and thus<br>
is not influenced by the introduction of the service. In the<br>
following description, suppose at first such a case that the<br>
number of electric power customers does not change in order to<br>
simplify the explanation.<br>
[0051]<br>
Year1 represents a single year before introducing the<br>
service and Year2 represents a single year after introducing<br>
the service. The ratio of the electric power flowing into the<br>
base stations in the period of Year1 to the electric power<br>
flowing into the base stations in the period of Year2 is supposed<br>
to be equal in a certain error range to the ratio of the electric<br>
power volume purchased by the power distribution company in the<br>
period of Year1 covered by the introduced service to the electric<br>
power volume purchased by the power distribution company in the<br>
period of Year2 without introducing the service.<br>
[0052]<br>
The power distribution company 1010 and the service<br>
provider 1009 agree as contracted that the error between the<br>
ratios defined above is negligibly small enough, and that the<br>
effect of the service is estimated based on the ratio of the<br>
electric power flowing into the base stations before and after<br>
introducing the service.<br><br>
[0053]<br>
Suppose that PByear1 is the electric power volume purchased<br>
by the power distribution company 1010 in a single year (Year1)<br>
before introducing the service, PByear2 is the electric power<br>
volume purchased by the power distribution company 1010 in a<br>
single year (Year2) after introducing the service, PB'year2 is<br>
the electric power volume purchased by the power distribution<br>
company 1010 in a single year (Year2) without introducing the<br>
service, PIbefore is the electric power flowing into the base<br>
stations in Yeari, PIafter is the electric power flowing into the<br>
base stations in Year2, the ratio of PIafter to PIbefore is equal<br>
to the ratio Rbase between the changes in the electric power<br>
demand in Year1 and Year2 due to the climatic condition<br>
independent of the introduction of the service.<br>
[0054]<br><br>
[0055]<br>
Then, in case that the service is not introduced in the<br>
period of Year2, the ratio R of the electric power purchased<br>
from the power generation company by the power distribution<br>
company in the period of Year2 to the electric power purchased<br>
in the period of can be expressed in the following formula.<br><br>
[0056]<br><br>
[0057]<br>
Supposing that the ratio of the efficiency increased by<br>
the service is Rservice (0≤service≤1) and assuming that Err=0<br>
in the formula 2, the following equation is satisfied.<br>
[0058]<br><br>
[0059]<br>
Next, Let us consider the increase or decrease in the<br>
number of the electric power customers, that is, the increase<br>
or decrease in the summation of the contracted volume of the<br>
retail electric power.<br>
[0060]<br>
At first, let us pay attention to Rbase. As shown in FIG.<br>
8, defining the change in the summation of the contracted volume<br>
of the retail electric power in the power distribution area of<br>
the base station to be a function Fcl(t), the ratio R'base between<br>
the changes in the electric power demand in the periods of Year1<br>
and Year2 due to the climatic condition independent of the<br><br>
introduction of the service for considering the above described<br>
correction can be expressed in the following formula.<br>
[0061]<br><br>
[0062]<br>
Similarly, as shown in FIG. 9, defining the change in the<br>
summation of the contracted volume of the retail electric power<br>
in the overall area of the service to be a function Fc2(t), the<br>
formula 3 defined above can be expressed in the following<br>
formula.<br>
[0063]<br><br>
[0064]<br>
Above expressions are based on such an assumption that<br>
the electric power demand due to the increase or decrease in<br>
the number of the electric power customers is proportional to<br>
the summation of the contracted volume of the retail electric<br>
power.<br>
[0065]<br><br><br>
[0066]<br>
The formula 6 gives the following formula.<br>
[0067]<br><br>
[0068]<br>
The value obtained by multiplying the cost of the electric<br>
power purchased by the power distribution company in the period<br>
of Year2 by Rservice as defined above is the profit money Yprofit<br>
obtained by introducing the service.<br>
[0069]<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, suppose that the change in the unit<br>
price of the electric power purchased from the power generation<br>
company 1012 by the power distribution company 1010 is a<br>
function Fp(t), and that the change in the purchased electric<br>
power volume is expressed by function Fb(t), the profit money<br>
Yprofit obtained by introducing the service can be expressed<br>
by the following formula.<br>
[0070]<br><br><br>
[0071]<br>
The profit money as defined above is divided between the<br>
power distribution company 1010 and the power generation<br>
company 1009 according to the contract concluded between them.<br>
[0072]<br>
In the service, it is required to make it a necessary<br>
condition to apply such an optimum power distribution network<br>
as described above with minimum power distribution loss to the<br>
practical power distribution operation in the service period<br>
of Year2. This is because the practical power distribution<br>
operation is based on the subjective decision by the operators<br>
of the power distribution company 1010 with overall estimation<br>
of the economical efficiency, the reliability of the power<br>
distribution system, the reliability of the power supply and<br>
the easiness in the operation, and furthermore because the<br>
reliability of the power distribution system and the<br>
reliability of the power supply have a higher priority than the<br>
economical efficiency of the operation.<br>
[0073]<br>
In case that the occurrence of applying the optimum<br>
distribution system with the minimum distribution loss in the<br>
period 1 is extremely low, the profit money Yprofit obtained<br>
by the service may be extremely low or it may be zero or negative<br>
in some occasions. For this reason, the lower bound Pmin for<br><br>
the occurrence of applying the optimum distribution system to<br>
the practical power distribution operation is determined in<br>
advance according to the contract concluded between the power<br>
distribution company 1010 and the power generation company 1009,<br>
and if Papplied ≥ Pmin, the profit money Yprofit obtained by the<br>
service is divided between the power distribution company 1010<br>
and the service provider 1009 based on the contract concluded<br>
between them as described above. On the other hand, if Papplide<br>
≤ Pmin, the power distribution company 1010 pays the service<br>
charge for the service provided by the service provider 1009<br>
in the periods of Year1 and Year2 to the service provider 1009<br>
instead of dividing the profit money independent of the profit<br>
money Yprofit being larger or small, or positive or negative.<br>
[0074]<br>
The method of calculating Papplide, the occurrence of<br>
applying the optimum distribution system to the practical power<br>
distribution operation, is described below.<br>
[0075]<br>
In this embodiment, the method of calculating Papplide is<br>
based on the difference between the power distribution loss<br>
Wactual in the actual power distribution system and the power<br>
distribution loss Vmin in the optimum power distribution system.<br>
As for the power distribution loss, the power distribution loss<br>
w1 for the single-phase wire system is generally obtained by<br><br>
the formula 9, and the power distribution loss for the<br>
three-phase three-wire system is generally obtained by the<br>
formula 10. Suppose that the load power is P, the line-to-line<br>
voltage is V, the load power factor is cos 9 , and the wiring<br>
impedance is R.<br>
[0076]<br><br>
[0078]<br>
Once the open-circuit and closed-circuit states of all<br>
the circuit breakers and the switches of the power distribution<br>
system in the service area, the summation of the power<br>
transmission loss in the actual power distribution system,<br>
Wactual, and the summation of the theoretical power distribution<br>
loss, Wmin, in case of applying the optimum distribution system<br>
is applied fully to the load in the actual power distribution<br>
system can be obtained.<br>
[0079]<br>
The occurrence of applying the optimum power distribution<br><br>
system to the actual power distribution system, Papplied, can be<br>
defined as in Formula 11, by using Wactual and Wmin.<br>
[0080] <br>
[0081]<br>
Next, the occurrence of applying the optimum power<br>
distribution system to the actual power distribution system,<br>
Papplied_year2, for the overall period of Year2 is calculated.<br>
[0082]<br>
Assuming that the power distribution loss in the actual<br>
power distribution system in a given day (day=i) is Wactual(i)/<br>
and the theoretical power distribution loss in case of operating<br>
the load with the optimum power distribution system, PapPlied_year2<br>
is obtained by Formula 12.<br>
[0083]<br><br>
[0084]<br>
As described above, according to the present invention,<br>
the power distribution efficiency increasing service and the<br>
power distribution efficiency increasing system which can<br>
increase the efficiency of the power distribution operation<br><br>
without plant and equipment investment, and contribute to<br>
strengthening the baseline of the management operation of the<br>
power distribution company can be provided.<br><br>
