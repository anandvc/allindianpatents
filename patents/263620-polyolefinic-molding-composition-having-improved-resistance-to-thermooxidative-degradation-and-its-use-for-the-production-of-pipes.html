				<td>Title:  Polyolefinic molding composition having improved resistance to thermooxidative degradation and its use for the production of pipes<br>
The present invention relates to a polyolefinic molding composition which has improved resistance to thermooxidative degradation and is particularly suitable for producing pipes which are in long-term contact with liquids comprising disinfectants having an oxidizing effect.<br>
Molding compositions comprising polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and poly-1-butene (PB-1) have for many years been used for producing plastic pipes for the distribution of cold and hot water, preferably in buildings.<br>
Although the pipes comprising the plastics mentioned have very good resistance to water, it has been found that their life is severely limited when the pipes come into contact with customary disinfectants which are often added to the water for hygiene reasons. This is important because small amounts of oxidizing substances such as chlorine gas, Na-hypochloride (bleaching liquor), calcium hypochloride or chlorine dioxide are generally added as disinfectants to municipal mains water. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or ozone is sometimes also used.<br>
The polyethylene pipes can be uncrosslinked or crosslinked. Crosslinking can be effected by the customary industrial crosslinking processes by means of organic peroxides, grafted vinylsilane esters or by means of high-energy radiation (y- or [J-rays) .<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to develop a novel molding composition which is based on pelydefins such as  polyethylene (PE), polypropylene<br><br>
(PP) or poly-1-butene (PB-1) and retains good processability to produce pipes with an improved stability when these are used for mains water comprising disinfectants having an oxidizing effect.<br>
This object is achieved by a molding composition of the generic class mentioned at the outset, whose distinguishing feature is that it comprises a thermoplastic polyolefin and an amount of from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the molding composition, of an organic polyoxy compound having the general chemical formula:<br>
R "  [(CH2)n-0]xa - H<br>
where n is an integer in the range from 1 to 10,<br>
m is an integer in the range from 3 to 500 and<br>
R is a hydrogen atom or an OH group or an alkyl group<br>
which has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and may bear<br>
further substituents such as -OH, -COOH, -COOR, -OCH3<br>
or -OC2H5,<br>
or an organic polyhydroxy compound having the general chemical formula:<br>
RO-CH2-C-(CH2-OR) 3<br>
where R can be a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group which has from 1 to 5 carbon atoms and may bear further substituents such as -OH, -COOH, -COOR, -OCH3 or -OC2H5,<br>
or a combination of the two.<br>
WO 2001/90230 discloses a polyolefin such as PE or PP which comprises polyethylene glycol in amounts of from 5 to 50% by weight as lubricant and is intended to be used, inter alia, for the production of pipes. However,<br><br>
the high additions of polyethylene glycol described there impair the mechanical properties of the poly-olefins and are therefore not suitable for the use of pressure-rated water pipes in buildings.<br>
JP-A 09/143318 (Nippon) describes a process for producing pipes, in which an LLDPE comprising an additive combination of fluoropolymer plus polyoxyalkylene is processed by extrusion and by means of which die dust is said to be avoided.<br>
The molding composition of the invention differs from the prior art in the incorporation of a smaller amount of polyoxy compound or polyhydroxy compound of the abovementioned chemical composition, which despite its presence in such small amounts gives the pipes comprising the molding composition good stability to the oxidizing effects of disinfectants in water over a long time period, which was particularly surprising.<br>
Polyoxy compounds which have been found to be particularly useful are polyethylene glycol, methoxypolyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. Preference is given to using polyoxy compounds which have a mean molar mass in the range from 400 to 9000 g/mol. The preferred amounts in which these polyoxy compounds are used are in the range from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 0,3% by weight.<br>
Polyhydroxy compounds which have been found to be particularly useful are pentaerythritol, trimethylol-propane, glycerol, mannitol and sorbitol. The preferred amounts in which these polyhydroxy compounds are used are in the range from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 0.3% by weight.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the molding composition may comprise additionally an unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon compound having the general chemical formula:<br>
R^- [ (CHR^) -CH=CH-CHR^]n-R^<br>
where R*^ and R^ are each, independently of one another, -H, -CH3, -OCH3 or -CH2OH and R2 and R3 are each, independently of one another, -H, -CH3, C2H5 or C3H7.<br>
The amount in which the additional unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon compound can be present in the molding composition of the invention is variable and is in the range from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the molding composition.<br>
As unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds, preference is given, according to the invention, to polyisoprene, polyoctenamer or polydecenamer.<br>
Thermoplastic polyolefins which are particularly suitable according to the invention are polyolefins such as PE, PP and PB-1 comprising the homopolymers and the copolymers of these with further olefinic monomers having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, which can readily be processed by the extrusion technology to produce pipes. Such polyolefins can be prepared by polymerization of the monomers in the presence of suitable catalysts such as Ziegler catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, chromium comprising Phillips catalysts or single side catalysts such as metallocenes or the like.<br>
The polymerization is carried out at temperatures in the range of from 0 to 200 °C, preferred from 25 to 150 °C and more preferred from 40 to 130 °C and under a<br><br>
pressure of from 0.05 to 10 MPa and preferred from 0.3 to 4 MPa. The polymerization may be performed discontinuous or preferred continuous in a single or multiple step process. Thereby it is possible to employ solutionpolymerization or suspensionpolymerization or stirred gas phase polymerization or gas phase fluidized bed polymerization. The artisan is familiar with this technology and with processes of this kind as they belong to the general knowledge.<br>
Molding compositions according to the invention can comprise PE which can be linear or non-linear and may have different densities such as high-density PE (HDPE) or medium-density PE (MDPE) or low-density PE (LDPE) or linear-low-density PE (LLDPE). In a preferred embodiment, the molding composition comprises a PE having a density at a temperature of 23°C in the range of from 0.93 to 0.965 g/cm"^ and a melt index MI190/5 in the range of from 0.1 to 2 g/10 min.<br>
Molding compositions according to the invention comprising PP can, for example, be high molecular weight isotactio or syndiotactic homopolymers, random copolymers or block copolymers having a melt index MI230/5 in the range from 0.1 to 2/10 min.<br>
Molding compositions according to the invention comprising PB-1 can be, for example, homopolymers or copolymers having a melt index MI190/2.16 in the range from 0.1 to 1 g/10 min and a density at a temperature of 23°C in the range from 0.92 to 0.95 g/cmThe molding composition of the invention can further comprise additional additives in addition to the thermoplastic polyolefin. Such additives are preferably heat stabilizers and processing stabilizers,<br><br>
antioxidants, UV absorbers, light stabilizers, metal deactivators, peroxide-destroying compounds, organic peroxides, basic costabilizers in amounts of from 0 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0 to 5% by weight, and also carbon black, fillers, pigments or combinations of these in total amounts of from 0 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the mixture.<br>
As heat stabilizers, the molding composition of the invention can comprise phenolic antioxidants, in particular pentaerythrityl (3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate which is obtainable under the trade name IRGANOX from Ciba Specialities, Germany.<br>
It was especially surprising that the molding composition in terms of the present invention can be processed to give pipes having an extraordinary improved long term stability, if such pipes are exposed to and in continuous contact with chlorinated water. Another highly surprising finding was the high resistance to breakthrough of such pipes in combination with their improved organoleptic.<br>
The following working examples are added to better illustrate the advantages of the new molding composition and especially those of the new pipes prepared therefrom. However, the working examples are by no means intended to cause any restrictions in the scope of the invention.<br>
