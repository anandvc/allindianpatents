				<td>Bone morphogenetic protein 4 and osteogenic devices and pharmaceutical products containing thereof<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to bone formation inducing proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), especially BMP-4, nucleic acid molecules encoding said proteins, vectors containing said nucleic acid molecules and host cells expressing said proteins. The present invention relates also to the use of said bone morphogenetic proteins for treating disorders, such as disorders related to bone and cartilage formation. The present invention further relates to osteogenic devices and pharmaceutical compositions containing said proteins.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The phenomenon of osteoinduction was recognized by Lancroix in 1945 when he demonstrated that acid alcohol bone extracts induced heterotopic bone formation in ectopic sites. Twenty years later Urist and his co-workers decalcified bone matrix and observed new cartilage and bone formation when implanted intramuscularly. These discoveries led to isolation and purification of bone inducing agent named BMPs from bone matrix of different species and years later to cloning and characterization of several cDNAs encoding these novel proteins. The biological activity of BMPs has been determined by bioassay in rat or mouse muscle bounces or by ALP measurements in mammalian cell cultures.<br>
Previous studies since 1965 have shown that BMPs are part of the TGF-(3 super-family and like all the family members they have multiple effects on cell migration, growth and differentiation especially in bone formation and tissue repair but also in embryogenesis or cancer. They are low molecular weight hydrophobic glycopro-teins which are soluble to chaotrophic agents such as urea and guanidinium hy-drochloride but are resistant to several proteases, for example collagenases.<br>
BMPs are produced as large precursor molecules which are processed proteolyti-cally to mature peptides after the translation. Like all the members of TGF-p super-family, BMPs have the pattern of seven cysteine residues in their C-termiinal mature region. Between these cysteines there are three disulfide bonds within mature BMP monomers and one disulfide bond which combines two monomers into a biologically active BMP dimer.<br><br>
BMPs act through specific transmembrane receptors located on cell surface of the target cells. The BMP receptors are serin-threonin kinases which resemble TGF-p receptors and are divided into two subgroups: type I and type II receptors. BMPs can bind strongly only to the heterotetrameric complex of these receptors. This complex formation is essential to the BMP signal transduction. Inside the target cell, BMP signals are transmitted to the nucleus via specific signal molecules called Smads, which are also responsible for suppression of BMP signals.<br>
Until now, 16 different BMPs have been characterized and seven of them (BMPs 2-7 and 9) have shown to be able to induce bone formation when implanted in ectopic sites. According to the amino acid sequence of the mature part these BMPs are divided into two subgroups. BMPs 2 and 4 are 86 % identical and BMPs 5, 6 and 7 are 78 % identical. Between these two groups the identity is only about 56 %. The amino acid sequence of BMP-3 is about 45 % alike with BMPs 2 and 4 and BMP-9 is 50-55 % identical with BMPs 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Due to high homology and small variety in size, BMPs are quite difficult, very time consuming and expensive to separate, purify and identify from each other at protein level. This is the reason why most of the BMPs are nowadays being produced using molecular biological tools. Different kinds of recombinant protein techniques have been tested and both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems have been utilized.<br>
Majority of research has focused on human recombinant BMPs, but with regard to effective bone induction antlers of Cervidae family form an interesting research area. Antlers are bony cranial organs typical to the Cervidae family and they differ from Bovidae horns in their growing pattern. Antlers grow from the tip and males cast them away once per year. It has been suggested that antlers are the fastest growing structures through the mammalian species and they are known to be the only structures that regenerate completely every year. Antlers are formed by modified endochondral ossification meaning that the process is performed through the highly vascularized cartilage model which is calcified and finally transformed into bone. Antlers form an interesting model of adult regenerating mineralized tissue and bone remodeling has been shown to continue until the time of antler casting. Although the ultimate reason for the amazing speed of antler growth has not yet been resolved, antlers have been shown to contain several BMPs. Deer antler has been proven to express BMP-2 and BMP-4 (Feng et a/. 1997 Biochim Biophys Acta 1350:47-52; Feng et a/. 1995 Biochim Biophys Acta 1263:163-168). In addition reindeer antlers express BMP-3b (Kapanen et al. 2002 J Biomed Mat Res<br><br>
59:78-83). Yet, it is also possible that there is one or more totally uncovered factor(s) which are responsible for antler growth speed.<br>
Due to their osteoinductive capacity, both BMPs extracted from demineralized bone matrix and BMPs produced by recombinant technique are very interesting and highly potential alternatives to bone grafting. Different BMPs have been used in many experimental and clinical studies.<br>
Bone morphogenetic protein 4 has been isolated from different origins including some mammalian species like human, mouse, rat, rabbit and dog. Like BMP-2 it has also been isolated from antler of Texas fallow deer a member of Cervidae family (Feng et a/. 1997; Feng et al. 1995). However, the functionality and effect of deer BMP-4 has not been demonstrated as it has not been produced in any expression systems.<br>
Until now, BMP-3b has been the only BMP characterized in reindeer antler tissue (Kapanen et al. 2002).<br>
Several in vitro studies have shown that BMP-4 signaling is required for chondro-genesis to convert chondrogenic precursor cells into chondrocytes. Its expression is enhanced by the impact of fracture and like BMP-3, -7 and -8 it shows a restricted period of expression from day 14 to 21. It is expressed in callus-forming tissue before callus formation. It also acts as a chemoattractive protein for primary human mesenchymal progenitor cells. Furthermore, BMP-4 has been shown to play a critical role in induction of bone formation both in vivo and in vitro and like BMP-2 its influence on embryogenesis can not be replaced by any other BMP. Though, functions and activity of BMP-4 have been under constant study for over the decade and though human BMP-4 has been produced as recombinant protein, until now, nobody has published information of the biological activity of BMP-4 cloned from the antler tissue of any member of Cervidae family.<br>
US 6 245 889 discloses purified human BMP-2 and BMP-4 proteins and processes for producing them. Also a pharmaceutical composition comprising said BMP-4 is disclosed. As generally known in the art, these proteins and compositions may be used in the treatment of bone and cartilage defects and in wound healing and related tissue repair. Further, said pharmaceutical composition may include a matrix capable of delivering said BMP proteins to the site of bone and/or cartilage damage, providing a structure for the developing bone and cartilage and<br><br>
optimally capable of being resorbed into the body. Such matrices may be formed of materials presently in use for other implanted medical applications.<br>
US 5 399 677 discloses DNA molecules encoding mutant forms of bone morpho-genetic proteins. The mutant forms of BMP can be produced bacterially and refolded to produce biologically active homodimers or heterodimers of BMP. A method of making such mutant BMP is also disclosed. Said mutant forms are useful since they are correctly folded when produced in bacterial hosts.<br>
WO 98/51354 discloses osteogenic devices and methods of use thereof for repair of bone and cartilage defects. The method for producing new bone growth at bone defect site in a mammal comprises the step of implanting in a defect site a calcium phosphate matrix comprising at least one osteogenic protein. Said osteogenic proteins include several morphogens, such as bone morphogenetic proteins.<br>
EP 1131087 discloses further use for morphogenetic proteins, such as BMP proteins. It is shown that exposing cancer cells to morphogens inhibits cancer cell growth and causes such cells to differentiate away from the cancerous phenotype. The use of morphogen can influence cancer cell fate and, in turn, alleviate the symptoms of cancer. Preferred morphogens disclosed include BMP-4.<br>
Although some applications of known BMP proteins as bone and cartilage forming inducers or for alleviating the symptoms of cancer are already known, there is still need for better methods for isolating such proteins and for better morphogenetic proteins, for example ones which possess more efficient bone forming properties or are more soluble. Such proteins would be useful for better therapeutic methods and applications. Also methods for producing such proteins would be useful.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Surprisingly in the present invention new BMP-4 protein isolated from reindeer, despite having high sequence homology with already known bone morphogenetic proteins, has very advantageous properties related to bone and cartilage forming. Said properties are substantially better than the properties of the known corresponding bone morphogenetic proteins. Said bone morphogenetic protein of the present invention and homologues thereof are useful for inducing bone and cartilage formation in several kinds of applications, such as therapeutic applications.<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Among mammalian species the homology of previously known BMP-4 mature parts is very high being TOO % between mouse and rat. When these two mature parts are compared to their counterparts characterized from Texas fallow deer and human the homology is 99 % (Table 1). Cloning and characterization of reindeer BMP-4 mature part revealed that at the amino acid level it has the highest homology with Texas fallow deer BMP-4 99 % and 98 % homology with mouse, rat, human and dog BMP-4. At amino acid level reindeer BMP-4 mature part has the lowest homology (96 %) with the rabbit counterpart. At the nucleotide level the homology between mature parts of reindeer and Texas fallow deer BMP-4 reached 99 % and between reindeer and human 93 %. When compared to reindeer BMP-4 mature part the lowest homology at nucleotide level was with rat 88<br><br>
%. Generally BMP-4 has homology also with other types of BMPs, for example with BMP-2.<br><br>

The following alignment shows the amino acid sequences of human and reindeer mature BMP-4 proteins (made with ClustalX 1.8 program (Thompson, J.D., Hig-gins, D.G. and Gibson, T.J. (1994) Nucleic Acids Research, 22: 4673-4680), rdBMP-4 = reindeer BMP-4, hBMP-4 = human BMP-4, the asterisks show the identical amino acids). These amino acid sequences differ only by two amino acids: amino acid 6 is serine in human and proline in reindeer (Ser6-&gt;Pro6), and amino acid 21 is leucine in human and proline in reindeer (Leu21-&gt;Pro21). Surprisingly the difference of only two amino acids leads to major differences in the function and efficiency of these two BMP-4 proteins. Since proline is a special amino acid generally having a strong effect to the structure and folding of proteins, it can easily be seen that the advantageous effect of the present invention is related to these specific two amino acids. Especially the proline 21 which replaces highly conserved leucine may play the major role in the present invention. Human BMP-4 is the closest counterpart of reindeer BMP-4 having the activity thereof determined.<br><br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
The "BMP-4 protein of the invention" or "bone morphogenetic protein of the invention" refers to a protein having bone morphogenetic (or morphogenic as both words are used interchangeably) activity, such as BMP-4 isolated from reindeer as described herein (SEQ ID NO: 1 of the attached sequence listing or rdBMP-4 in the alignment above), and includes homologues, analogs, derivatives and fragments thereof. Such homologues or derivatives include functional derivatives of said protein, such as proteins derived from the original reindeer BMP-4 protein or any BMP from any species. The derivatives may differ in length and they may contain amino acid insertions, deletions and substitutions, as a person skilled in the art well knows. Characteristic for the bone morphogenetic protein of the present invention are the essential amino acids 6 and/or 21 of the mature protein, which are both prolines in reindeer, as disclosed in the alignment above. Preferably the regions containing these amino acids are conserved in a BMP protein of the present invention.<br>
On the other hand, insertions, deletions and substitutions located far outside said characteristic area may not be likely to cause substantial changes in the function, effect or folding of the BMP of the present invention. For example homologues having deletions, such as deletions of few amino acids, preferably 1-10 amino acids, more preferably 1-5 amino acids, most preferably 1-3 amino acids, in car-boxyl terminus or amino terminus resulting in shorter polypeptide are in the scope of the present invention as long as said deletions do not affect the characteristic amino acids of the BMP of the invention. It is preferred that said homologues have the advantageous properties of the original reindeer BMP-4 proteins, said properties being related to said characteristic amino acids Pro6 and/or Pro21 and/or the region around it. Said homologues may have amino acid substitutions which do not substantially affect the function and effect of the protein of the invention. For example an amino acid not located in the active site or near it may be substituted with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties (e.g. hydrophobic or hydrophilic), i.e. conservative amino acid replacement, as long as said substitution does not substantially alter the function or folding of the mature protein. These kinds of substitutions are well known and understood in the art. Examples of such amino acid properties divided into groups are hydrophobic (Met, Ala, Val, Leu, lie), neutral hydrophilic (Cys, Ser, Thr), acidic (Asp, Glu), basic (Asn,<br><br>
Gin, His, Lys, Arg), residues that influence chain orientation (Gly, Pro) and aromatic (Trp, Tyr, Phe) amino acids. Substitutions within said groups are generally not likely to cause major changes in the structure of the polypeptide backbone (e.g. a sheet or helical conformation), the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule or the bulk of the side chain.<br>
The homologues of the BMP (e.g. BMP-4) of the present invention include for example any known bone morphogenetic protein which contains or has been modified to contain at least one of said two essential amino acids, Pro6 or Pro21 or the corresponding amino acids in a homologous BMP in the case the numbering should differ. Also any currently unknown BMP-4 protein from any species modified as described above is in the scope of the invention.<br>
Since Pro21 replaces highly conserved leucine, the BMP of the present invention contains amino acid proline corresponding to the Pro21 or prolines corresponding to both of the prolines at Pro6 and Pro21 defined from SEQ ID NO: 1 at corresponding locations. Said locations are calculated from the amino terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1, corresponding virtually to any mature BMP-4 protein. The sequence at the amino terminus may be SPKHH (as in SEQ ID NO: 1) or homologue thereof, as for example in human or reindeer or in other mammalian. Said locations may be defined by aligning the similar sequences of said homologues, derivatives or fragments with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
If there were any insertions or deletions of amino acids in the amino acid sequence of said homologue, derivative or fragment affecting the numbering, those should be taken into account when defining the location of said essential prolines, for example by aligning the sequences as described above and then defining the locations of said essential amino acids. However, any of said homologues, derivatives or fragments of the BMP-4 protein should substantially have the function and efficiency disclosed herein. Because all the known BMP-4 proteins are highly conserved (Table 1, at least 96 % at amino acid level in mammals, or the alignment below), defining the location of said essential prolines is unambiguous, such as in the case of human BMP-4. Also, said locations can be easily defined also from other BPMs (see the alignment below). Generally such level of homology may be at least 70 %, preferably 80 %, more preferably 90 % and most preferably 96 % at the amino acid level.<br><br>
In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP-4 containing the consensus sequence of BMP-4 family between the two pralines: P-Q-R-A/S-R-K-K/R-N/K-K/R-N/H-C-R-R-H-S/A-P. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP-4 containing the corresponding consensus sequence of BMP-4 and BMP-2 aligned together: P-Q-R-A/S-R/K-K/R-K/N/R/L-N/K-K/R/S-N/H/S-C-R/K-R-H-S/A-P. This consensus sequences have been defined from a sequence alignment of several BMP-4 and/or BMP-2 proteins from different species, such as shown in the ClustalX alignment below. Said consensus sequences correspond to the amino acids 6-21 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Also other consensus sequences may be defined, for example ones defining an area around the second proline (Pro21 in SEQ ID NO: 1), such as in another embodiment: C-R/K-R-H-S/A-P-Y-V-D-F-S-D or similar sequences differing in length, e.g. by 1-5 amino acids. Such consensus sequences may be defined from the alignment below or similar alignments made by aligning different related BMP proteins. The BMP sequences aligned are from reindeer, human, rabbit, bovine, dog, Texas fallow deer (Cervus dama, DAMDA), rat, mouse, house shrew (suncus murinus), chicken, African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) and zebrafish (danio rerio).<br>
In one embodiment the BMP of the invention is any BMP-2, such as reindeer BMP-2, which has been modified to contain the amino acids or a sequence, such as a consensus sequence, of the invention as described herein.<br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
In another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 6-21 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 1-16 of the SEQ ID NO: 1. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 16-23 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is any BMP or a homologue, derivative or fragment thereof containing the amino acids 1-23 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In still another embodiment the BMP of the present invention is a BMP-4 protein or a homologue, derivative of fragment thereof, such as one containing the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. The homologues, derivatives or fragments mentioned in these embodiments shall contain at least the amino acid Pro6 (i.e. the mutation L-&gt;P as shown in the alignment above), or both amino acids Pro6 and Pro21 as described above. Said homologues, derivatives or fragments do not include the known BMP-4 proteins as such, such as hBMP-4, since they do not contain said characteristic amino acids of the BMP-4 of the present invention. However, a known BMP-4 modified to con-<br>
tain at least one of said characteristic amino acids may be considered as such homologue, derivative or fragment.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides the BMP as described above with a heparin binding site (HBS). Generally this is an amino acid sequence capable of binding heparin. In one embodiment said heparin binding site is located at the amino terminus of said BMP, such as before the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or functional homologue thereof. In one embodiment the heparin binding site contains amino acid sequence AKHKQRKRGT or QAKHKQRKRGT. Said heparin binding site may also be a functional homologue, derivative or fragment thereof. The heparin binding site improves the expression of the recombinant BMP protein and also enhances the biological activity thereof. Further, the heparin binding site significantly helps the expression of recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins in bacterial cells, such as E. coll.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a nucleic acid molecule, such as a DMA or RNA molecule, encoding said BMP of the invention. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code there are a number of different nucleic acid sequences encoding the BMP of the invention. All such nucleic acid variants are in the scope of the present invention. Preferably said nucleic acid molecule is a DNA molecule. Examples of said DNA sequences are disclosed in figures 5-7. One embodiment of the present invention provides a replicable vector containing the nucleic acid molecule described above in operative association with an expression control sequence thereof. Such vector may be used for producing recombinant BMP of the present invention in a suitable host system.<br>
The nucleic acid encoding the BMP of the invention may be inserted into said replicable vector for cloning or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may, for example, be in the form of a plasmid, cosmid, viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) using techniques well-known in the art. Vector components may include for example one or more signal sequence(s), an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of such suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are well-known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
Generally said BMP may be produced recombinantly by expressing in any suitable host cell, such as bacterial host cell. Such methods are well known in the art and they are described in literature. It is essential that the protein is folded properly during the expression and it contains the necessary post-translational modifications.<br>
It is not always possible to express and purify certain proteins property, for example because of solubility or refolding problems. Usually E. coli can not make post-translational modifications typical for mammalian cell systems. However, the inventors of the present invention have produced recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part in E. coli and after purification and refolding managed to prove it to be in biologically active form.<br>
There are certain benefits when a protein, such as a BMP, is expressed in a bacterial host, such as E. coli. The protein generally shows lowered immunogenicity when compared to a similar protein expressed in for example yeast host. This may be useful later when the protein is utilized, for example administered as a medicament. E. coli produces proteins without modifications, such as glycosylation. This is particularly useful for proteins for which glycosylation is not a requirement, but which could be a problem if the protein is produced in other systems (e.g. yeast), which can over-glycosylate, or add inappropriate carbohydrates to the protein, which could lead to reduced or no activity of expressed protein and potentially create a risk of immunogenicity (Pedro de Noronha Pissarra: Recombinant DNA Proteins for the Biopharmaceutical Industry and the Future for Escherichia coli. Business Briefing: Pharma Outsourcing, London, 2004).<br>

In the following description and examples it is described how recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part according to one embodiment of the present invention was produced in E. coli. After purification and refolding the osteoinductive activity was verified by bioassay in mouse tight muscle pounches.

It includes implantation of BMP in the hindquarter muscle of a mouse and estimation of heterotopic new bone induction after 10-21 days by radiology and histology:<br><br>
Image analysis in determination of BMP activity is done by attenuation of X-ray beam through bone and it can be seen on the radiograph as an X-ray-positive "ra-dioplaque" shadow compared to soft tissues. This is the basis for radiographic detection and radiomorphometric quantitation of newly formed bone after implantation of BMP or other bone inductive agent in a heterotopic or an orthotopic site.<br>
The osteoinduction was observed in all three study groups (1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg of recombinant reindeer BMP-4) and it was increased in dose-dependent manner (Table 2). When compared to its human counterpart the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 was verified to be about five times more potent bone inducer than identically produced recombinant human BMP-4 (even with 7.5 mg doses) therefore <br>

Table 2. The observed osteoinduction.<br>
The results of the in vivo bioassay are shown in figure 9. Figure 9A is a reference and 9B is a sample implanted with BMP-4 of the present invention. The bioassay was carried out as described in Marshall R. Urist, J.J. Chang, A. Lietze, Y. K. Huo, A. G. Brownell and R. J. DeLange (1987): Preparation and Bioassay of Bone Morphogenetic Protein and Polypeptide Fragments, Methods Enzymol 146: 294-312.<br>
There were great difficulties to get recombinant rdBMP-4 mature part expressed in £. CO//TOP10. Therefore, the inventors assumed that poor expression was caused by the high GC-content in N-terminal region of the mature part of rdBMP-4. Because heparin binding site (HBS), existing in the beginning of the reindeer BMP-2 mature part, is coded by nuclebtide sequence with low GC-content, a construct in which this HBS sequence was added in front of the rdBMP-4 mature part se-<br><br>
quence was created and this way the inventors managed to improve the expression of recombinant.<br>
HBS located in the N-terminus of rdBMP-2 contains 10 basic amino acid residues and is reminiscent of known or postulated heparin-binding sites in other growth factors. It is possible that the interaction between protein with HBS and extracellular matrix might have an important effect on the establishment of morphogenetic gradients during development by limiting the free diffusion of a protein. Therefore, it was assumed that HBS could also improve the biological activity of recombinant rdBMP-4 by prolonging the duration of disappearance of protein from the implantation site.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Cloning and sequencing of mature part of the cDNA of reindeer BMP-4<br>
A. RNA isolation<br>
The antlers of a 3-year-old male reindeer are cut off and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after slaughtering. The frozen antlers are cut in 0.5 cm slices and stored at -70°C. Reindeer antler mRNA is isolated using the QuickPrep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). A part of the reindeer antler slice is cut in small spices (about 1 mm3) and 0.1 g of this tissue is added to 0.6 ml of Extraction Buffer containing guanidinium thiocyanate and N-lauroyl sarcosine. The tissue is homogenized with Ultra Turrax for 3 times 10 seconds on ice and cooled between every homogenization. 1.2 ml of Elution Buffer is added and suspension is further homogenized for 1 times 10 seconds. A uniform suspension is obtained.<br>
The reindeer antler homogenate and Oligo(dT)-Cellulose are centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 1 minute. The buffer from the Oligo(dT)-Cellulose pellet is removed and the cleared tissue homogenate is placed on the top of it. The tube is inverted to resuspend the Oligo(dT)-Cellulose pellet. The suspension is gently mixed for 5 minutes and centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 10 seconds. The supernatant is discarded.<br><br>
Oligo(dT)-Cellulose is resuspended in High-Salt Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCI] and suspension is centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 10 seconds. Washings with High-Salt Buffer are repeated for 5 times and 2 additional times with Low-Salt Buffer [10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCI]. 3 ml Low-Salt Buffer is added and suspension is transferred to MicroSpin Column. The MicroSpin Column is placed in Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at top speed for 5 seconds. Oligo(dT)-Cellulose in the column is rinsed for 3 times with Low-Salt Buffer.<br>
The reindeer antler mRNA is eluted to a clean Eppendorf tube from the MicroSpin Column by adding 0.2 ml 65°C Elution Buffer (QuickPrep® Micro mRNA Purification Kit, Pharmacia Biotech) to the column and centrifuging at top speed [14,000 rpm, RT, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 5 seconds. The elution step is repeated twice. The isolated mRNA is precipitated by adding 5µlof glycogen solution (5-10 mg/ml in DEPC-treated H20), 1/10 volume potassium acetate solution (2.5 M potassium acetate, pH 5.0) and 0.5 ml absolute ethanol (chilled to -20 °C) to each elution. Precipitation is allowed to occur at -20°C for at least 30 minutes and mRNA is centrifuged at top speed [14,000 rpm, 4°C, Centrifuge 5415 C (Eppendorf)] for 5 minutes. Precipitated mRNA is stored at -70°C until cDNA synthesis is performed.<br>
8. cDNA synthesis<br>
Reverse transcription of the reindeer antler mRNA is performed by modifying the instructions of the Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). 3 µg of mRNA is heat-denatured at 65°C for 10 minutes and chilled on ice. 0.2 µmol DTT, 0.5 µg Oligo(dT)12-18 Primer and heat-denatured mRNA are added to First strand reaction mix containing FPLCpure™ Cloned Murine Reverse Transcriptase, RNA-guard™, RNase/DNase-Free BSA, dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) in aqueous buffer (Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech). The mixed solution is incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After the incubation, the First strand reaction mix is added to the Second strand reaction mix containing E. coli RNase H and £. coli DNA polymerase I and dNTPs in aqueous buffer (Time Saver™ cDNA Synthesis Kit, Pharmacia Biotech). The solution is mixed gently and incubated in RT for 30 minutes. The synthesized cDNA is stored at 4°C.<br>
C. Screening of reindeer antler cDNA<br><br>
The mature part of the cDNA of the reindeer BMP-4 is amplified by PCR (Poly-merase chain reaction) method using primers (51- GGATCCGAGCCCCAAGCAT-CACCCACAGAGG-31) and (31- AAGCTTGCGGCACCCACATCCCTCCACTAC-5') (Table 3) designed on the basis of homology of already known BMP-4 gene of Texas fellow deer. In addition to 100 ng of reindeer antler cDNA and 40 pmol of each primers the 50 µl of PCR reaction mixture contains 0.4 mM dNTPs (PCR Core Kit, Roche) and 0.7 U/µl Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (thermostable Taq polymerase + proofreading polymerase, Roche) in Expand High Fidelity buffer with MgC\2 (Expand High Fidelity PCR System, Roche). The reaction is performed under the following program using Mastercycler personel apparatus (Eppendorf): initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes and 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 1 minute, annealing of the primers 55°C for 1 minute, elongation of DNA strands 72°C for 2 minutes. The final extension is performed at 72°C for 10 minutes.<br><br>

D.	Cloning into pGEM®-T vector<br>
The PCR products were purified straight from the PCR reaction mix by Wizard® PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega) and ligated into the pGEM®-T vector (Figure 1) by T4 DNA Ligase (pGEM®-T Vector System I; Promega). 0.3 pg of purified PCR product and 2.3 µg/ml of pGEM®-T vector are added to ligation buffer containing 18 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.8), 6 mM MgCI2, 6 mM DTT, 0.3 mM ATP, 3 % polyethylene glycol and 0.14 U/µl T4 DNA Ligase in total volume of 66 µl. The reaction is allowed to occur at +16°C water bath which is allowed to cool down to +4°C overnight. The newly formed plasmid is called pGEMrd4/116 (Figure 1).<br>
E.	The production of competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F'cells<br><br>
The competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F1 cells (Invitrogen) are produced by the calcium chloride/ magnesium chloride procedure. 2 ml of LB-medium is inoculated with £ coli TOP10 F1 cells and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm). Next morning 100 ml of fresh LB-medium is inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture and the culture is grown at 37°C with shaking (225 rpm) to an OD6oo = 0.5-0.6. The cultured cells are collected by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5 min), resus-pended in 10 ml of 0.1 M MgCI2 solution and collected again by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5 min). After the MgCI2 treatment the cells are resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M CaCI2 solution, incubated in ice bath for 30 minutes and recollected by centrifugation (2500 x g, 5 min). The CaCI2 treatment is repeated except in the second time 3.5 ml of CaCI2 is used and the incubation time is 1 hour. Glycerol is added to suspension to final concentration of 14 % (v/v) and the solution is divided into 200 pi portions. The competent E. coli TOP10 F' cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C.<br>
F.	Transformation of the competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F' cells and selection<br>
of clones containing reindeer BMP-4<br>
The competent Escherichia co//TOP10 F' cells are melted in ice bath for 15 minutes. 10 µl of ligation mix (described above) is added to 100 µl of TCM (10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM CaCI2, 10 mM MgCI2, pH 7.0) and mixed with 200 µlof the competent £. coli cells. The mixture is incubated in ice bath for 30 minutes before the heat shock (43°C, 3 minutes). After the heat shock 800 µl of LB medium is added and the cells are allowed to regenerate for 45 minutes at 37°C. The transformed cells are collected by centrifugation at top speed for 2 minutes and resuspended to 30 µl of growth medium. The cell suspension is plated to two LB plates containing 25 µg/ml ampicillin covered with 1 mmol IPTG (isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and 2.4 nmol X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-ß-D-galactoside) and the cells were grown at the plates overnight at 37°C. The positive clones are recognized as white colonies based on a-complementation of lacZ gene. The method is described in detail in Sambrook and Russel (2001), Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York.<br>
G.	Isolation of pGEMrd4/116 plasmids and sequencing ofcDNA inserts<br>
The plasmids are isolated by Wizard® Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) and then further purified by ethanol precipitation. The cDNA identity is confirmed by sequencing with ABI Prism (Perkin-Elmer Corporation). The se-<br><br>
quencing reaction is performed using DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Mastercycler Personel apparatus (Eppen-dorf). The primers in the PCR reaction for sequencing are (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGA-3') and (31- ATTTAGGTAACACTATA-GAATAC -5') (Table 4) and the program is as follows: 25 cycles of denaturation 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing 50°C for 15 seconds, elongation for 60°C. The amplified PCR products are precipitated by ethanol precipitation method. In 10 pi reaction 1 ul of 1.5 M Na-acetate - 250 mM EDTA buffer and 95-100 % ethanol is added so that the final ethanol concentration is 75 %. The precipitation is allowed to occur in ice bath for 10 minutes and then the mixture is centrifuged for 20 minutes. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet is washed with 125µl of 70 % ethanol in RT. The solution is centrifuged briefly and the washing ethanol is removed as precisely as possible. The pellet is dried in 37°C for a few minutes until all the ethanol is completely fumed. The ABI Prism apparatus located in Department of medical biochemistry and molecular biology, University of Oulu, Finland, was used for the final sequencing.<br><br>

Example 2: Expression of the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part in Escherichia CO//TOP10 F', Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells<br>
A. Subcloning of the mature part of reindeer BMP-4 from pGEM®-T vector to the expression vector pTrcHis 2A (Invitrogen) and transformation of the competent Escherichia coli TOP10 F' cells<br>
The subcloning of the mature part of reindeer BMP-4 from pGEM®-T vector to the expression vector pTrcHis 2A (figure 2) is accomplished by first digesting the mature part off from pGEM®-T vector using Bam HI and Hind III restriction enzymes<br><br>
and then ligating the insert to pTrcHis 2A digested with the same enzymes. The Bam HI (Roche) and Hind III (Roche) digestion of pGEM®-T construct and pTrcHis 2A (1 µg) is performed in 10 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM NaCI, 5 mM MgCI2, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0 (SuRE/Cut Buffer B, Roche) with 1 U/µl of each restriction enzyme. The reaction is allowed to occur for 1.5 hours in 37°C and then the restriction enzymes are inactivated by heating in 65°C for 20 minutes and freezing in -20°C. Ligation is performed in 2x Rapid Ligation Buffer (supplied with pGEM®-T vector by Promega) in +16°C water bath which is allowed slowly to cool to +4°C overnight (ligase concentration 0.1 U/ul).<br>
The newly formed construct is checked by sequencing (protocol is described in Example 1 Part G) using primers (5'-AGAGGTATATA7TAATGTATCG-3') and (3'-ATGGTCGACGGCGCTATTCAG-5'). Expression vector containing pTrcHis 2A plus the reindeer BMP-4 mature part cDNA is named as pTrcrd4/116 (figure 2). The competent Eschenchia co//TOP10 F1 cells are transformed as described in Example 1 Part F.<br>
B.	Insertion of the mature part of reindeer BMP-4 to the expression vector<br>
pET22b(+) (Novagen) and transformation of the competent Eschenchia coli Ori<br>
gami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3) cells<br>
The subcloning of the mature part of reindeer BMP-4 to the expression vector pET22b(+) (Novagen) (figure 3) is performed as described above (see Example 2 Part A). The newly formed plasmids containing pET22b(+) plus the reindeer BMP-4 mature part cDNA is named as pETrd4/116 (figure 3). The competent Eschenchia coli Origami B (DE3) (Novagen) and Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) cells are transformed following the instructions of the user manual shipped with the competent cells (Novagen).<br>
C.	Expression of the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part in Eschenchia coli<br>
cell cultures and collection of the cells<br>
E. coli cells [TOP10, Origami B (DE3) and Rosetta (DE3)] containing either pTrcrd4/116 or pETrd4/116 are grown overnight in 50 ml of SOB medium containing ampicillin (50 µg/ml) and for Rosetta (DE3) cells also chloramphenicol (35 µg/ml) in +37°C with shaking (225 rpm). Next morning 1200 ml of SOB medium, containing antibiotics mentioned above, is inoculated with 24 ml of overnight culture and incubated in +37°C with shaking (225 rpm) until OD600 is 0.6 when the<br><br>
cells are in mid-log phase. At this point the recombinant protein expression is induced by adding IPTG to final concentration 1 mM. After the induction the cells are grown additional 4 to 5 hours and then collected by centrifugation. The amino acid sequences of the recombinant proteins produced with respective nucleotide sequences are presented in figure 5 (pTrcrd4/116) and figure 6 (pETrd4/116).<br>
Example 3: Purification and refolding of the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part<br>
A.	Washing of inclusion bodies<br>
Collected cells are suspended in 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 220 g cells / 1 liter of buffer) by shaking. Suspension is centrifuged in 5,500 g for 45 minutes in +4°C. Na-phosphate washing is repeated once. Cell pellet is weighted and stored in -70°C overnight. Frozen pellet with partly erupted cells is thawed and suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer with 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 8.5, 25 mg/ml) by shaking 2 minutes. Suspension is centrifuged 26,000 g for 30 minutes in +4°C and Tris-HCI-EDTA washing is repeated once. The remaining pellet is weighted. In last washing step, pellet is suspended (200 rpm/minute, overnight, RT) in lysis buffer 6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 8.0, 35 mg/ml) when all the remaining intact E. coli cells are erupted and inclusion bodies made soluble. Suspension is centrifuged (26,000 g, 45 min, RT), pellet discarded and recombinant protein in soluble form in remaining supernatant. Finally, to be sure to get rid of all cell remnants, supernatant is filtered through 45 µm filter.<br>
B.	Precipitation according to isoelectric point (pi)<br>
The recombinant reindeer BMP-4 expressed from pETrd4/116 in Escherichia coli Origami B (DE3) or Rosetta (DE3) cells is precipitated by isoelectric precipitation in pH 8.12. Isoelectric point is determined with computer calculations according to amino acid sequence of the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 (figure 6). The precipitant is collected by centrifugation (12,000 g, 30 min, RT) and resuspended in lysis buffer (6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI; pH 8.0).<br>
C.	Immobilized metal affinity chmmatography (IMAC)<br>
Escherichia coli cells were lysed by shaking in 6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI (pH 8.0) for 2 hours and filtrated through 45 urn filter. In IMAC<br><br>
method, pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) are used. Columns are charged with Co2+, Cu2+ or Ni2+ ions according to instruction manual applied by supplier. The aid of the use of the his-tag-epitope at the end of the rdBMP-4 protein was that the his-tag-epitope bound up in the metal ion charged column and the impurities caused from E. co//cell debris flow through. After column charging, filtered supernatant from washing steps is applied in column. Majority of impurities is removed by washing the column with lysis buffer (6 M GuHCI - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI, pH 8.0) 5-10 times the bed volume. Second washing is performed with 5-10 times the bed volume of buffer in which 6 M GuHCI of lysis buffer is replaced by 6 M urea. Recombinant reindeer BMP-4 is eluted from the HiTrap column by pH gradient from pH 7.0 to pH 4.0 (6 M urea - 20 mM Na-phosphate - 0.5 M NaCI). The fractions are analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the ones containing approximately pure rdBMP-4 are combined for refolding of recombinant protein (Figure 8).<br>
D. Refolding of recombinant rdBMP-4 mature part<br>
The BMP-4 fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against water. After dialysis precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resus-pended in 8 M Urea, 0.1 M Tris/HCI, pH 8 in the presence of 100 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and incubated for 2 h at 25 degrees. The pH was lowered to pH 3-4 by drop wise addition of 1 M HCI. The DTT was removed completely by dialysis against 6 M urea, 10 mM HCI for 2 h at 25 degrees. Dialysis was continued at 4°C overnight against 6 M urea. Refolding of recombinant rdBMP-4 was performed by two step dialysis. The first dialysis solution was 20 mM Tris-HCI - 150 mM NaCI -3 M urea (pH 7.5). The dialysis buffer was changed for four times within two or three days. In second step all salts were removed by exhaustive water dialysis. Dialysis water was changed at least six times during two to three days. Desalted sample was centrifuged and pellet was dried by lyophilization. At that point the purity of BMP-4 was 75 % and its refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was 50 %. Quantification of the refold dimer of recombinant reindeer BMP-4 on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels was done densitometrically.<br>
Example 4: The biological activity test of the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part<br>
The biological activity of the lyophilized recombinant reindeer BMP-4 was tested by implanting less than one mg of recombinant protein absorbed into Lyostrypt®<br><br>
collagen sponge or gelatin capsule in mouse tight muscle pouches. BSA was used as control. The hind legs were roentgenographed and the implant sites dissected and fixed in 10 % neutral formalin solution. Fixed implants were cut into 4µm sections and stained with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Sections were examined with a light microscope. A new bone formation as an area and optical density was evaluated by radiographs. The radiographic images were transferred into a computer by using an optical scanner (HP Scan Jet, Hewlett Packard, USA). Ectopic and or-thopic new bone formations were evaluated as the areas (mm2) of calcified tissue visible in the radiographs defined by using the Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp., USA) software. The mean optical density (mmAI) of the defined area was measured with the same equipment.

Example 6: Addition of heparin binding site in front of the mature part of the reindeer BMP-4<br>
A. Addition of heparin binding site coding DNA fragment to pTrcHis 2A vector<br>
Two complementary primers seen in Table 5 were designed using heparin binding site (HBS) of the reindeer BMP-2 as a model. Bam HI and Kpn I restriction sites were added in 5' and 3' ends of HBS, respectively. The primers were first denatured in +100°C for 5 min and then annealed by allowing a small +100°C water bath to cool down to room temperature and further to +4°C (1h). Both annealed HBS fragment (1 µg) and pTrcHis 2A vector (0.5 pg) were digested by Bam HI (1 U/µl) and Kpn I (2 U/ul) in Multi-Core buffer (Promega) in +37°C for 1.5 hours and ligated in +16°C water bath which was allowed to cool down to +4°C overnight.

MgCl2 was added to final concentration of 3 mM and DNasel (Roche) to final concentration of 10 µg/ml and mixture was incubated for 30 min at RT in order to digest DNA.<br>
Half of the mixture volume of 60 mM EDTA, 6 % Triton X-100, 1.5 M NaCI pH 7 buffer was added to the solution and mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Inclusion bodies were spin down by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C with SS-34 rotor. Pellet was resuspended in ratio of 8 ml per g of cells in 0.1 M Tris pH 7, 20 mM EDTA buffer and centrifugation step was repeated. Inclusion body isolate was weighted and stored in -20°C.<br>

Inclusion body isolate was mixed overnight with stirring to 35 mg/ml to 6 M GuHCI, 0.02 M Na2HP04, 0.5 M NaCI pH 8 (lysis buffer). In the next morning solution was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 min with SS-34 rotor. Supernatant was filtered trough Whatman GB 002 paper (Schleicher &amp; Schuell). Centrifugation and filtration was repeated once and sample was stored at 4°C.<br>
Pre-packed HiTrap Chelating HP affinity column (Amersham Biociences) was charged with Co2+ ions and equilibrated with sample buffer (lysis buffer pH 8) according to manufactures procedure. 30-40 ml of the filtrated protein sample was applied to the column and washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer pH 8. Second wash was done with 50 ml of 6 M urea, 0.02 M Na2HPO4, 0.5 M NaCI pH 8.<br>
Desired protein with Hise-tag was eluted out of the column with 200 ml of 6 M urea, 0.02 M Na2HPO4, 0.5 M NaCI pH 4. In final step column was washed with 200 ml of 6 M urea, 0.02 M Na2HPO4, 0.5 M NaCI, 0.5 M imidazole pH 8. 50 ml fractions were collected during every step.

The column was then washed with 20 times bed volume of the same buffer and recombinant HBSrdBMP-4 was eluted from the heparin column by NaCI gradient from 0 to 2 M also in the same buffer. The fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with the highest purity of HBSrdBMP-4 were combined. In Western blot analysis specific antibodies against His6 and BMP-4 were used. Combined fractions were ready for refolding procedure.<br>

Refolding of recombinant HBSrdBMP-4 was performed as described in Example 3 part D for recombinant rdBMP-4.<br>
Example 8: The biological activity test of recombinant reindeer BMP-4 mature part with heparin binding site<br>
The biological activity of the lyophilized recombinant reindeer HBSrdBMP-4 was tested by implanting the recombinant protein absorbed into Lyostrypt® collagen sponge or gelatin capsule in mouse tight muscle pouches. BSA was used as control. The hind legs were roentgenographed and the implant sites dissected and fixed in 10 % neutral formalin solution. Fixed implants were cut into 7 µm sections and stained with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Sections were examined with a light microscope. The new bone formation as an area and optical density was evaluated by radiographs. The radiographic images were transferred into a computer by using an optical scanner (HP Scan Jet, Hewlett Packard, USA). Ectopic and or-thopic new bone formations were evaluated as the areas (mm2) of calcified tissue visible in the radiographs defined by using the Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp., USA) software. The mean optical density (mmAI) of the defined area was measured with the same equipment. Catibration of the optical density was performed by using an aluminum wedge (Al) with 0.25 mmAI steps, giving a calibrated density range up to 4 mmAI.<br>
Results<br>
Cloning of partial cDNA of reindeer BMP-4<br>
The nucleotide sequence obtained from ABI Prism reactions was analyzed with computer and it was compared to already known BMP sequences. Due to homol-<br><br>
ogy searches the newly cloned cDNA seemed to be most homological with deer BMP-4 (nucleotide homology 99 % and amino acid homology 99 %) and with mouse, rat, human and dog BMP-4 (amino acid homology 98 %). Nucleotide and amino acid homologies of BMP-4 proteins between mammalian species are presented in Table 1.<br>
Expression of reindeer BMP-4 mature part<br>
First, the mature part of reindeer BMP-4 was cloned in pTrcHis2A vector and E. co//'TOP 10 cells were transformed by resulted pTrcrd4/116 vector. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG. Recombinant protein production was checked by SDS-PAGE, but no induction was observed. This was expected to be caused by several codons in rdBMP-4 which were rare for E. coli codon usage. It could be also possible, that it is caused by high GC content in the beginning of the rdBMP-4 coding sequence (the first 10 codons have a GC content of 70 %).<br>
Because of these facts it was decided to try another vector system with different E. coli cell lines pET22b(+) (Novagen) with His6-tag and pelB leader was chosen as the new expression vector and Rosetta (DE3) and Origami B (DE3) E. coli lines were chosen for expression. The mature part of reindeer BMP-4 was cloned to pET22b(+) and a new plasmid was named as pETrd4 and both Rosetta (DE3) and Origami B (DE3) cells were transformed with the constructed vector. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, overexpression of rdBMP-4 protein was observed. Due to expression studies mainly Rosetta (DE3) cells with pETrd4 vector were used in producing recombinant rdBMP-4.<br>
Purification of rdBMP-4<br>
Recombinant reindeer rdBMP-4 protein was overexpressed in E. coli. After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies the content of recombinant reindeer rdBMP-4 was 85 %.<br>
The next purification step was the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). After the elution of the column with pH gradient, the purity of rdBMP-4 measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 75 % (Figure 8). The isolated protein with the mature part of rdBMP-4 had a MW of 17,800 Da as shown by the electro-phoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.<br><br>
Refolding and activity tests of rdBMP-4<br>
The in vitro refolding of the denatured rdBMP-4 protein was quantified by measuring of the refold dimer of the protein on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels den-sitometrically. The amount of refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was by the protein 50 %.<br>
The osteoinductive activity induced by rdBMP-4 was increased in dose dependent manner (Table 2). Table 9 presents in details how the osteoinductive activities were shown on separate animals. The animals were divided in groups, wherein R1-R3 were implanted with different amounts of reindeer BMP-4 and groups R4-R7 with human BMP-4. When compared to its human counterpart the recombinant reindeer BMP-4 was proven to be much more potent inducer of bone formation in all concentrations tested.<br>
Tables 10 and 11 show statistical summaries of comparisons between groups R1-R3 (doses of 5, 3 and 1 mg of rdBMP-4) and between groups R1 (5 mg of rdBMP-4) and R5 (5 mg of human BMP-4), respectively. The analysis of the first group R1-R3 was made with Kruskal-Wallis test and the groups showed statistically significant differences (p=0.023). Groups R1 and R5 were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U-test and also these groups showed statistically significant differences (p=0.032). It is obvious without testing that the differences between the reindeer groups (R1-R3) and the human groups are significant in favor of the reindeer ones. Due to the great number of zero values in the human groups the statistical tests could be applied only between the groups R1 and R5.<br><br><br>

Recombinant reindeer HBSrdBMP-4 protein was slightly overexpressed in E. coli and produced as inclusion bodies (IBs). After the wash treatment, isoelectric point precipitation and solubilization of the inclusion bodies, they were next purified with the affinity chromatography (IMAC and heparin). After the elution of the columns, the purity of HBSrdBMP-4 measured from the SDS-PAGE was up to 75 %. The isolated proteins with the mature part of HBSrdBMP-4 had a MW of 17,700 Da as shown by the electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions.<br>
Refolding and activity tests of HBSrdBMP-4<br>
The in vitro refolding of the denatured HBSrdBMP-4 protein was quantified by measuring of the refold dinner of the protein on Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels densitometrically. The amount of refolding measured by non-reducing SDS-PAGE was by HBSBMP-4 protein over 60 %.<br>
HBSrdBMP-4 protein produced in E co//TOP10 expression system showed biological activity when implanted in mouse tight muscle pouch. Furthermore, the refolding of the rdBMP-4 with HBS was significantly higher than without HBS, which makes the HBSrdBMP-4 of great value (data now shown).<br><br>
