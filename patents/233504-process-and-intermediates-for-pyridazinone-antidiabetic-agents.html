DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of formula IV (1-4 in Scheme I) of this invention are intermediates in the synthesis of the potent aldose reductase compounds of Formula I. The compounds of Formula I are known to be useful in the treatment of diabetic complications. The process of this invention is set forth in Scheme 1. In general, the compounds of formula 1-4 of this invention are prepared as set forth therein.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
R6 As set forth in Scheme 1, a compound of formula 1-4 is prepared as follows. An organolithium base such as n-butyllithium is added to a solution of a compound of formula 1-1 in a reaction inert solvent. Suitable reaction inert solvents include ether solvents such as dioxane, diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Other suitable organolithium bases include methyl lithium, t-butyllithium, etc. The reaction mixture is stirred at a temperature of about -78°C to about 0°C for five minutes to about five hours. It is preferred to carry out the reaction in tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of about -40°C for about one hour. The organolithium intermediate 1-2 is then formed by addition of a sulfur source such as sulfur powder (S8) The reaction mixture is stirred at about -78°C to about 0°C for about one minute to about five hours and preferably at about -40°C for about 5 minutes. The reaction mixture is warmed to about -20°C to<br>
about room temperature and preferably to about 0°C for about five minutes to about one hour and preferably for about 30 minutes  A solution of a compound of formula 1-3 in a reaction inert solvent as described above and preferably tetrahydrofuran is added and the resulting mixture is stirred at -20°C to about room temperature and preferably at 0°C The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature over about one hour to about five hours and preferably for about two hours The reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature for a period of time, preferably one to five hours and most preferably for one hour The desired compound is isolated from the reaction mixture as set forth in Example One below or according to other methods well known to those skilled in the art<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, a compound of formula 1-6 is prepared as follows. A compound of formula 1-4 is dissolved in a reaction inert solvent such as a (C1- C2) alkanol such as methanol or ethanol and is treated with a (C1- C2)alkoxide such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide at about 40°C to about the reflux temperature of the solution for about three hours to about twelve hours. It is preferred to use sodium methoxide in methanol at about 50°C for about five hours. This forms the intermediate compound of formula 1-5, wherein Alk is (C1-C2)alkyl, which is subsequently treated with a mineral acid, preferably concentrated HCI, at about 40°C to about reflux for about eight hours to about twenty hours. It is prefeable to reflux the reaction mixture for about fifteen hours. The desired compound of formula 1-6 is isolated from the reaction mixture as described in Example Two below or according to other methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, a compound of formula 1-7 is prepared as follows. A compound of formula 1-6 is dissolved in a reaction inert solvent, preferably an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or dioxane and is treated with an oxidizing agent. The oxidizing agent may be any reagent which is capable of oxidizing a sulfanyl group to a sulfonyl group, such as hydrogen peroxide, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid and other such reagents well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It is preferable to use a urea hydrogen peroxide complex, in which case, the person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that it will be desirable to use an activating agent such as trifluoroacetic anhydride in the reaction. The reaction is earned out in a reaction inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or diethyl ether and preferably tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of about<br>
0°C to about 35°C with warming to about room temperature for about thirty minutes to about five hours It is preferred to carry out the reaction at a temperature of 0°C to about 25°C with warming to room temperature for about two hours The desired compound of formula 1-7 is isolaterd from the reaction mixture as described in Example Three below or according to other methods well known to those skilled in the art<br>
