				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the synthesis of conducting copolymer of poly aromatic amines and substituted aromatic amines in the presence of specific organic dopants and a process for the preparation of the said copolymer. These copolymers can be used for the dissipation of electrostatic charge, for the shielding of electromagnetic interference and as absorbing of electromagnetic waves in the microwave region and for corrosion preventive studies.<br>
The invention also provides a method of preparation of melt blended conducting composites of said copolymers with thermoplastics like PET, nylon, acrylics, polyamides, high impact polystyrene (HIPS), polycarbonate (PC), polypropyleneoxide(PPO)+HIPS and a combination of thereof. These melt blended composites have applications in the emerging areas of material science like electrostatic charge dissipation (ESD), Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, stealth technology or microwave absorption and for anticorrosive coating formulations. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Conducting polymers have emerged as important class of electronic materials because of their potential and wide applications in energy storage systems, optoelectronic devices, light emitting diodes, sensors for hazardous gases and toxic fumes, corrosion inhibitors for iron and mild steel and EMI shielding in radio frequency range and microwave absorption. The conducting polymer is a subfield of the larger, older field old organic electrical conductors which had already started in early 1970's, with the discovery of (SN)x. These organic materials may possess electronic conductivity comparable to metals. The conducting polymer, polyacetylene, has electronic conductivity of the order of 105 S/cm whereas the conductivity of copper is 106 S/cm. However, with the idea that electronic conductivity can be varied with doping level (or oxidation state) has revolutionized the area of research. These acquire importance over inorganic semiconductors in their application because of their high strength to weight ratio, toughness, low cost and ease of processing into film. The prospect of plastic metals has inspired much interest in these materials for technological applications such as antistatic coatings and electromagnetic interference shielding and in other areas where light weight, flexibility and high conductivity materials are required. Among conducting polymers.<br>
polyaniline and its analogues have been widely studied due to its ease of protonic acid doping in the emeraldine form and its environmental stability in both doped and undoped forms. Conducting polymer, polyaniline, exists in various forms and each form find technological application. The fully reduced form of polyaniline is leucoemeraldine which finds applications in Li-polyaniline battery and electrochromic devices. 50 % reduced and 50 % oxidized form of polyaniline is termed as emeraldine base which is the insulating form of polyaniline. It finds application in sensors for HC1 gas and as corrosion protective coating on iron and mild steel. Doping of emeraldine form leads to the formation of conducting polyaniline which is used as an electrode material in batteries, sensors, EMI shielding and electrochromic devices. The fully oxidized form of polyaniline is pernigraniline which find applications in non-linear optics. Conductivity in polyaniline depends on the degree of protonation of the material as well as on the oxidation state of the chains.<br>
The polymerization of aromatic amines to poly aromatic amines in the presence of organic protonic acids like p-toluene sulphonic acid, dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid and aerosol OT may bring certain changes in the properties of polyaniline because conduction mechanism in polyaniline involves protonation as well as ingress of counter anions to maintain charge neutrality. Protonation and electron transfer in polyaniline leads to the formation of radical cations by an internal redox reaction which causes the reorganization of electronic structure to give two semiquinone radical cations. In the doping process, ingress of anions occurs to maintain charge neutrality in the resultant doped polyaniline matrix. This implies that nature of anions should influence the properties of the resulting polyaniline. This is the reason why polyaniline doped with inorganic dopants like Cf and SO42- are thermally less stable than the polyaniline doped with organic dopants like p-toluene sulphonate or dodecylbenzenesulphonate.<br>
The invention relates to the preparation of copolymer of aromatic amines which should be soluble in organic solvents like monoethylene glycol (MEG), THF, DMSO, DMF etc. which should be thermally stable upto 285-300°C. It was found that when the polymerization of aromatic amines was carried out in the presence of sodium salt of sulfo-isophthalic acid and the like, it has resulted in the preparation of polyaniline which is thermally stable upto 300°C but the polymer was insoluble in organic solvent like<br>
MEG which was a desired property for its application for blending with polyester etc. Polyaniline doped with conventional inorganic acids is thermally stable upto 140-150°C whereas polyaniline doped with p-toluene sulphonic acid, dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid is thermally stable upto 240-250°C. The polymerization carried out with NaSIPA, LiSIPA and the like resulted in the preparation of polymer which is thermally stable upto 300°C. Doping of polyaniline with organic protonic acids can be carried out by direct method in which a monomer is polymerized in the presence of organic protonic acid or by indirect method in which emeraldine base is doped with desired organic acid. Isothermal studies data of the Polyaniline doped with dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (DBSA) shows that whereas in case of PANI-DBS system, at a isothermal temperature of 200°C, there is weight loss of-4.82 % which increases to 19.25 % at 250°C. This implies that PANI-DBSA system can be used for melt blending applications where the temperature of the insulating system does not exceed 200°C. In case of PANI-RIL system, isothermal studies indicated that upto 250°C, there is loss of -10.15 % from the PANI-RIL system. At temperatures of 280°C, the loss is -12.4582 % whereas the loss at 300°C is ~ 14%. This means that polymers can be melt blended with other polymeric systems having melting temperatures from 280-290°C. However, this polymer was insoluble in monoethylene glycol (MEG) which was a medium required for blending with specific polymer like PET.<br>
In order to achieve solubilization of polyaniline in organic solvents, synthesis of copolymers of substituted aniline with aniline were formed. The copolymers of these substituted anilines with aniline were carried out keeping the ratio of aniline: substituted aniline:: 95 : 5 or aniline: substituted aniline :: 90 : 10. These ratios were taken in order to see the effect of copolymerization on solubilization and that the copolymerization should not lead in decrease in conductivity compared to parent polymer, polyaromatic amine. DSC studies of the copolymer doped with NaSIPA showed initial transition at 100°C which may be due to the water entrapped in the polymer backbone. A small transition was also observed at 140°C which may be associated with some transition taken place in the dopant because the same transition has been observed in the DSC of the dopant molecule. After this, a sharp transition is observed at 290°C which is associated with the<br>
melting point of the dopant moiety because the same behavior is observed in the dopant<br>
molecule itself.<br>
The DSC and TGA studies have shown that these melt blended composites (PET + doped<br>
copolymer) have melting point around 252-254°C are thermally stable upto 445°C<br>
XRD studies of the base and doped forms of copolymers have been carried out. The<br>
incorporation of dopant brings some degree of crystallanity in the copolymer matrix<br>
because base forms of the copolymers show completely amorphous behavior.<br>
The conductivity of the copolymers prepared by taking 95:5 ratio of aniline: substituted<br>
aniline (2-isopropyl aniline or 2-sec-butylaniline), were determined using four-probe<br>
method.<br>

US Patent Number: US7,160,575 Bl) issued January 9, 2007Measurement in the frequency range 3 MHz 106 Hz of the dielectric characteristics of emeraldine base polyaniline dissolved in l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and cast into bulk free-standing polymer films shows features similar to those reported by others and which are a result of microphase separation into reduced and oxidized repeat units. However, upon confinement into the cylindrical pores, of average diameter 20 nm, of a porous membrane such features of microphase separations do not occur. The microphase separation observed in the bulk polymer is suppressed by strong pinning of the charge carriers due to interactions of the polymer with pore walls together with constrained chain packing and a non-uniform rate of evaporation of the NMP solvent from the pores. This enhances the bulk conductivity after doping by reducing the internal intra-chain disorder introduced by microphase separation.<br>

Synthesis and characterization of soluble conducting poly(o-/m-toIuidine-co-o-nitroaniline), Synthetic Metals 145 (2004) 113-118. Copolymers of o-/m-toluidine with o-nitroaniline were chemically synthesized in various molar ratios of the comonomers by emulsion polymerization. Although o-nitroaniline does not homopolymerize, the copolymers of o-nitroaniline with o-/m-toluidine could readily be synthesized. The copolymers show comparatively higher conductivity, better solubility and higher thermal stability than the homopolymers, ortho- and meta-polytoluidines. Subtle differences in the properties between the copolymers of o- and  m-toluidine with o-nitroaniline could be due to the variation in the monomers and the orientation along the copolymer chains. Synthesis and Characterization of Processable Polyaniline Doped with Novel Dopant NaSIPA, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 108 (2008) 1437-1446. Aniline has been polymerized in the presence of a novel dopant sodio-5-sulfo isophthallic acid (NaSIPA), via the chemical oxidative polymerization route. The thermal stability and processability of polyaniline prepared by indirect method (PDl) have been improved significantly (290°C) as compared to polyaniline doped with conventional inorganic dopants like HC1 or H2S04, without much loss of electronic conductivity (5.07 S/cm in PDl). This suggests its use for melt blending with engineering thermoplastics. However, polyaniline prepared by direct method (PD2) can be melt-blended only with conventional thermoplastics   like  polyethylene,  polypropylene,   polystyrene,   etc.   Low-temperature studies reveal the 1-D variable range hopping as a conduction mechanism for direct polymer (PD2), with parameters To and σo as 4112 K and 15.1  S/cm, respectively. However, for indirectly doped polymer (PDl) Arrhenius-type model, having parameters j(Ep-Ec)| and ΣC as 0.04 eV and 28.4 S/cm, respectively, it suited well. The coherence length as found from XRD data was around 28.8 nm for PDl and 25.2 nm for PD2.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Objective of the present invention is to provide a novel copolyaromatic amine. Another objective is to provide a process of preparation of copolyaromatic amine. Further objective of present invention is to provide a copolymer having thermal stability upto 300°C.<br>
Further objective is to provide the polymer free from benzidine during polymerization or heating to 300°C and therefore free from the potent carcinogens.<br>
Further objective is to provide a copolymer having improved solubility compared to homopolymer of aniline (polyaniline) in the organic solvents like Monoethylene glycol (MEG), Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), Dimethly formamide (DMF). N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), Tetrahydro furan (THF).<br>
Further objective is to provide a copolymer which is easy to melt blend with PET due to good solubility in MEG compared to polyaniline and can be used in the areas like EMI shieling, microwave absorption, antistatic applications and anticorrosive formulations. Still another objective is to provide a melt blended composite material with PET, using novel copolymer, wherein the composite has better thermal stability, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity than PET.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the synthesis of copolymer of aniline with substituted anilines using Sodium 5-sulphoisophthalic acid (NaSIPA) as dopant, resulting in the formation of copolymer having thermal stability upto 285-300°C. As compared to the homopolymer of aniline (polyaniline), these copolymers show enhanced solubility in organic solvents like Monoethylene glycol (MEG), Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), Dimethly formamide (DMF), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), Tetrahydro furan (THF). The electrical conductivity is in the same range as that of homopolymer of aniline (polyaniline). These copolymers can be used for the dissipation of electrostatic charge, for the shielding of electromagnetic interference and as absorbing of electromagnetic waves in the microwave region and for corrosion preventive studies.<br>
The copolymer is free from benzidine even at 300°C, which is the temperature required for blending with certain polymers. These results have been confirmed by TG-Mass studies of the samples carried out at 300°C. The benzidine is a potent carcinogen and can exert harmful effects even in traces. Both these novelties are realized due to the inventive step   of  preparation   of   copolymer   of   aniline   and   substituted   anilines   (like   2-<br>
isopropylaniline, 2-sec-butyl aniline) and doping the resultant copolymer with sodium 5-sulphoisophthalic acid.<br>
The melt blending of the said copolymers with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) leads to melt blended composite having better thermal stability, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity than matrix polymer (PET). The invention also provides a method of preparation of melt blended conducting composites of said copolymers with thermoplastics like nylon, acrylics, polyamides, HIPS, PC, PPO+HIPS and a combination thereof. These melt blended composites have potential applications in the emerging areas of material science like electrostatic charge dissipation (ESD), Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, stealth technology or microwave absorption and for anticorrosive coating formulations<br>
