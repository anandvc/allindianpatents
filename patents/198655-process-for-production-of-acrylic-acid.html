				<td>As an improvement for the process for produc- tion of acryl ic acid by subjecting acrolein or an acro- lein-containing gas to gas-phase oxidation with molecu- lar oxygen in a fixed bed multi tubular reactor, there is provided a novel process capable of producing acrylic acid at a high yield by suppressing the generation of heat spots in catalyst or the build-up of heat in hot spots of catalyst. The process comprises filling, in each of reactor tubes, two or more ki nds of catalyst particles of different volumes so as to form a plurali.ty of catalyst layers in the axial direction of the tube in such a manner that the particle volume of catalyst layer becomes smaller as the position of catalyst layer chang- es from the raw material gas inlet side of the tube to the raw material gas outlet side, each catalyst particle comprising, as the active component, a compound oxide containing at least Mo and V.</td>

				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   a   process   for production   of   acrylic   acid   by  subjecting   acrolein   or  an acrolein-containing   gas   to  gas-phase   catalytic  oxidation with  molecular   oxygen   or   a  molecular   oxygen-containing gas   in   a   fixed   bed   multitubular   reactor.<br>
For  the  process  for  production  of  acrylic   acid by  subjecting   acrolein   to   gas-phase  catalytic oxidation, or  for   the  catalyst   used   therein,   many  proposals  were made   in,   for   example,   Japanese   Patent   Publication   No. 26287/1969,   Japanese   Patent  Application   Kokai   (Laid-Open)   No.   8360/1972,   Japanese   Patent   Publication   No. 43917/1978  and  Japanese  Patent   Application   Kokai    (Laid-Open)   No.   218334/1991.     Some  of   the  catalysts  proposed in   these   literatures  can   produce  acrylic  acid  at   a fairly   high   yield   viewed   from   the  industrial   standpoint, and   some   of   them  are   in   actual    use   in   acrylic  acid   pro¬duction   by  direct   oxidation   of   propylene.      In   industrial production   of   acrylic   acid  with   these   catalysts,   howev¬er,   there  are   various   problems.      One   of   the   problems   is generation  of   high-temperature   portions   (hereinafter referred   to  as   hot   spots)   in  catalyst   layer.     In   indus¬try,   it   is   required   to   increase   the  productivity   of acrylic   acid   and,   to   achieve  it,   increased   concentration or   increased   space   velocity   of   reaction   gas   (raw   materi¬al)   is   employed   generally.     The   increased   acrolein   con¬centration   is   advantageous  in  plant   and  equipment   in¬vestment   and   operating  cost   (e.g.   electric   power   ex¬pense)   but   has   the   following   problems.     That   is,    the heat   of   reaction   generated   is   larger;    it   generates   hot spots   in   the   catalyst   layer  and   gives   rise   to  excessive oxidation;   as   a   result,   the   catalyst   used   is   thermally deteriorated   and,   in   the   worst   case,    run-away  may   be b rought   about .<br><br>
Hence,   prior  arts  were  made   in  order   to  keep the   temperatures  of   hot   spots   lower.      For   example, Japanese   Patent   Publication  No.   30688/1978   describes  an approach   that   the  catalyst   portion   filled   at   the   raw material   gas   inlet   side  of   reactor   tube   is   diluted with an   inert   substance;   and   Japanese   Patent   Publication   No. 10802/1995   proposes   an   approach   that   the   proportion   of catalyst   active  component   supported   on   carrier   is   made larger   as   the   position   of   catalyst   layer   changes   from the   raw  material   gas  inlet  side   of   reactor   tube   to  the raw  material   gas   outlet   side.      However,   in   the   former approach,   the   inert   substance   as  diluent   should   be  uni¬formly   mixed   with   said   catalyst   portion,    requiring  much effort   and,   moreover,   it   is  difficult   to   fill   a   uniform mixture   into   a   reactor   tube;   thus,   the   approach   is   not satisfactory.      Meanwhile,    in   the   latter   approach,   pro¬duction   of   catalysts   is   complicated   and   sufficient   care must   be   taken   to   fill   a  plurality of   catalysts  in   a right   o rder.<br>
Therefore,    the  object   of   the   present   invention lies   in   solving   the   problems   of   the   prior   art  and   pro¬viding   a   process   for   producing   acrylic   acid   efficiently by  subjecting   acrolein   or   an   acrolein-containing   gas   to gas-phase  catalytic   oxidation  with  molecular  oxygen  or   a molecular-oxygen-containing  gas.<br>
More   particularly,   the   object   of   the  present invention   lies   in   providing   a  process   for   producing acrylic   acid   by  subjecting   acrolein   or  an   acrolein-con-taining   gas   to   gas-phase   catalytic   oxidation  with   molec¬ular  oxygen   or  a  molecular-oxygen-containing   gas,    in which   process   the   generation   of   hot   spots   or   the   build¬up  of   heat   in   hot   spots   is   suppressed   even   under   the high-load   reaction   conditions   and   consequently  acrylic acid   can   be   produced   at   a   high   productivity   and,   more¬over,   catalyst   life   can   be  extended.<br>
Up   to   the  completion   of   the   present   invention.<br><br>
it   had   been   considered   that   in   the  exothermic   reaction such  as   catalytic  gas-phase  oxidation   conducted   in   the present   invention,    use  of   catalyst  particles  of  larger size   hinders   heat   transfer  between   catalyst   particles and  as   a   result   the   temperature   of   hot  spots  becomes higher.     The   present   inventors,    however,   found  out   that use  of   catalyst   particles   of   larger  size,   i.e.   larger volume,   can   lower   the   temperature of   hot  spots  and   fur¬ther   that  when   two   or  more   kinds  of   catalyst   particles of  different   volumes  are   filled   in   a   reactor   tube   so  as to   form   a  plurality   of   catalyst   layers   (reaction   zones) in   the   axial    direction   of   the   tube   in   such   a  manner   that the  volume   of   catalyst   particle   becomes   smaller   as   the position  of   catalyst   layer  changes   from  the   raw material gas   inlet   side  of   the   tube  to  the   raw  material   gas outlet   side,    the   above-mentioned   object   of   the  present invention   can   be   attained.<br>
According   to   the   present   invention   there   is provided   a  process   for   producing   acrylic   acid   by   sub¬jecting   acrolein   or   an   ac rol ei n-contai ni ng   gas   to   gas-phase   catalytic  oxidation   with   molecular   oxygen   or  a molecular  oxygen-containing  gas   in   a   fixed   bed  multi¬tubular   reactor,   in   which   process   two   or  more   kinds   of catalyst   particles   of   different   volumes   are   filled   in each   reactor   tube   so  as   to   form   a  plurality   of   catalyst layers   in   the   axial   direction   of   the   tube   in   such   a manner   that   the  volume  of   catalyst   particle   becomes smaller   as   the   position   of   catalyst   layer  changes   from the   raw   material   gas   inlet   side   of   the   tube   to   the   raw material   gas   outlet   side,   each   catalyst  particle   com¬prising,   as   the  active  component,   a  compound   oxide represented   by   the   following   general    formula:<br>
wherein   Mo   is   molybdenum;   V   is   vanadium;   W   is   tungsten;<br><br>
A   is  at   least   one  element   selected   from  antimony   and tin;   B   is  at   least   one  element   selected   form  copper  and iron;   C   is   at   least   one  element   selected   from magnesium, calcium,   strontium   and   barium;   D  is   at   least   one   element selected   from   titanium,   zirconium  and   cerium;   and   0  is oxygen;   a,   b,    c,   d,   e,   f,    g   and   h   represent   the   atom numbers   of Mo,   V,   W,   A,   B,   C,   D   and  0,   respectively;   and when   a   is   12,   2g b^  14,   0^ c^ 12,   0^  dg 5,    0
The  starting  material   used   in   the   present invention   is   acrolein   or   an   acrolein-containing   gas.     As the  acrolein   or  acrolein-containing  gas,   there  can   be used,   for  example,    (1)   an   acrol ein-containing   gas   ob¬tained   by  catalytic   gas-phase  oxidation   of   propylene  and (2)   acrolein   separated   from  said  gas,   which   may  contain, as   necessary,   oxygen,   steam  and/or  other   gases.<br>
The  active   component  contained   in   the  catalyst particles   used   in   the   present   invention   is   a  compound oxide   represented   by   the   above-mentioned   general    formu¬la,   preferably   a  compound   oxide   of   the   general   formula wherein   when   a   is   12,   3i  b^ 10,   0.1^  eg 10,    Og dg  4, O.lg eS 5,   Qg   fg 2.5  and   Og gg 8   (h   is  a  value  deter¬mined   by  the   oxidation  states  of   the   elements Mo,   V,   W, A,   B,   C   and   D).<br>
The  catalyst   particles   used   in   the   present invention   can   be   produced   by  any  of   various   processes ordinarily   used   in   production  of   such   catalyst   parti¬cles.      The   starting   materials   used   in   production   of   the catalyst   particles   are  not  particularly   restricted   and can   be   the  ordinarily  used   ammonium  salts,    nitrates, sulfates,   hydroxides,   oxides,   etc.   of   Mo,   V,   W,   A,   B,   C and   D.      Compounds  each  containing  different   kinds   of metals   may  be   used.      The   catalyst   particles   of   active component-on-inert   carrier   type   can   also   be   used.      Spe¬cific  examples   of   the   carrier  used   are   a-alumina,   sili-<br><br>
con   carbide,    silica,   pumice,   silica-magnesia  zirconium oxide,    titanium  oxide,   and   silica-alumina.      As   to   the heat-treatment   temperature  employed   in  catalyst  parti¬cles   production   (i.e.   firing   temperature),    there   is   no particular   restriction.      The   heat-treatment   temperatures of   the   catalyst   particles   filled   in   different   catalyst layers   (reaction   zones)   may   be   the   same  or   different. In   the   present   invention,    however,   generation  of   hot spots  or   heat   build-up  in   hot  spots  can  be   suppressed effectively   by   filling,   in   the   catalyst   layer   (reaction zone)   closest   to   the   raw   material   gas   inlet   of  each reactor   tube,   catalyst   particles   heat-treated   at   a temperature   higher   by   5-30°C  ,   preferably   10-20°C    than that  of   the  catalyst  particles   filled   in   the   following catalyst   layer  downstream   of   the  above  catalyst   layer.<br>
As   to   the  shape  of   the   catalyst   particles, there   is   no   particular   restriction.      The   shape  may   be any  of   spherical   shape,   columnar   (pellet-like)   shape, ring   shape,   indefinite   shape,   etc.     The  spherical   shape need   not   be   a   truly   spherical   shape   and  may   be  a   sub¬stantially  spherical   shape.     The   same   applies   to   the columnar  shape  and   the   ring   shape.     As   to   the  dimension (size)   of  each   catalyst   particle,   the   ratio   (D/d)   of   the inner  diameter   (D)   of   each   reactor   tube   (in   which   each catalyst   particle   is   filled)   to   the  diameter   (d)   of  each catalyst   particle   is   desirably   2/1   to   15/1,    preferably 2.5/1   to   10/1.     Herein,   the   diameter   of   catalyst   parti¬cle   refers   to   diameter  of   particle   (in   the   case  of spherical   catalyst   particle),   diameter  of   column   (in   the case   of   columnar  or   ring-shaped   catalyst   particle),   or longest   distance  of   arbitrarily   selected   two  ends   (in the  case  of   catalyst   particle  of   any   other   shape).      In the  columnar   or   ring-shaped   catalyst   particle,   it   is preferable   to   select   the   particle   length   so   as   to   have   a particle   length/particle   diameter   ratio  of   0.3/1    to  3/1, for   the   productional   or   application   reasons.     The   inner<br><br>
diameter   (D)   of   each   reactor   tube  used   is  desirably   10-50  mm,   preferably   15-40  mm.     Use  of   catalyst   particles having   a   larger   diameter   (d)   in   the   above-mentioned range  of   D/d   gives   a  smaller   pressure   resistance   in catalyst   layer   and   thereby  an  energy   necessary   for introduction   of   raw   material   gas   into   reactor   tube   can be  made   smal1er.<br>
In   the   present   invention,   there   is   used   a fixed   bed  multitubular   reactor   wherein   each   reactor   tube has   a  plurality  of   catalyst   layers   (reaction   zones)   in the   axial   direction   of   the   tube.     The   number  of   the catalyst   layers   is   appropriately  determined   so   that   the highest   effect   can   be  obtained.     Too   large   a  number produces   disadvantages   such  as   complexity  of   catalyst filling   and   the   like;   therefore,   an   industrially   desir¬able   number   is   about   2-6.<br>
In   the   present   invention,   there   are   prepared two  or   more   kinds  of  catalyst  particles  of   different volumes,   whose   active   component   is   a   compound  oxide represented   by   the   above-mentioned   general    formula. These   catalyst   particles   are   filled   in   each   reactor   tube so   as   to   form   a  plurality   of   catalyst   layers   (reaction zones)   in   the   axial   direction   of   the   tube   in   such   a manner   that   the   volume  of   catalyst   particle   becomes smaller   as   the   position   of   catalyst   layer   changes   from the   raw  material   gas   inlet   side   of   the   tube   to   the   raw material   gas   outlet   side.      That   is,   in   the   present invention,   in   each   reactor   tube,   a  catalyst   layer   filled with   catalyst   particles   of   largest   volume  must   be   formed closest   to  the   raw  material   gas   inlet   and   a   catalyst layer   filled   with   catalyst   particles   of   smallest   volume must   be   formed  closest   to   the   raw material   gas  outlet and,   as   the   position   of   catalyst   layer  changes   from  the raw  material   gas   inlet   side   to   the   raw material   gas outlet   side,    the  volume  of   catalyst   particle  must   become smal1er.<br><br>
In   the   present   invention,   the   volume  of   cata¬lyst   particle   refers   to   an   average  of   the  volumes   of   the catalyst   particles   filled   in  one  catalyst   layer   (reac¬tion   zone).      It   is,    for   convenience,    an   average  of   the volumes   of   ten   catalyst   particles  arbitrarily  selected from   the   catalyst   particles   filled   in   one   catalyst layer.      In   the   case   of   hollow  catalyst   particles,   e.g. ring-shaped   catalyst   particles,    the  volume   occupied   by the  contour  of   particle  is  the   volume   of   catalyst   parti¬cle  according   to   the  present   invention.      In   the  case  of spherical   or   columnar  catalyst   particles,   the  volume  of catalyst   particle  can   be   determined   by  ordinary  calcula¬tion.      When   the   catalyst   particle   is   a  molded   catalyst obtained   by  molding   an   active   component   into   a  definite or   indefinite   shape,   the   volume   of   the  molded   catalyst is   the   volume   of   catalyst   particle   according   to   the present   invention.     When   the  catalyst   particle  is   a supported   catalyst   comprising   an   active   component   and  a carrier   supporting   the   active  component,   the  volume   of the  supported   catalyst   is   the  volume   of   catalyst   parti¬cle   according   to   the  present   invention.<br>
In   the   present   invention,   it   is   desirable   that the  catalyst   particles   filled   in   one   catalyst   layer (reaction   zone)   have  substantially   the   same   volume. Therefore,   when   catalyst   particles   having   substantially the  same   volume   are   filled   in   one  catalyst   layer,    the volume   of   catalyst   particle   or   average  volume  of   cata¬lyst   particles   in   one   catalyst   layer   can   be   expressed   by the  volume  of   any  one  catalyst   particle  used   in   the catalyst   layer.<br>
In   the   present   invention,   it   is   also  desirable that   the   ratio  of   the  volume  of   catalyst   particle   in  one catalyst   layer   (reaction   zone)   to  the   volume  of   catalyst particle   in   the   following   catalyst   layer   downstream  of the   former  catalyst   layer   is   controlled   to   be   1.2/1   to 27/1,   preferably   1.5/1   to   24/1,    for   the   prevention   of<br><br>
heat   build-up   in   hot  spots  as well   as   for  effective reaction.     When   the   volume   ratio   is   smaller   than   1.2/1, the  effect   of   using   two  or  more   kinds   of   catalyst   parti¬cles   of   different   volumes   is   insufficient;    in  order   to obtain   a  sufficient   effect  with   such   a  volume   ratio,   the number   of   catalyst   layers   must   be   larger,   making   it necessary  to   prepare  catalyst  particles  of   more   kinds different   in   size   and   requiring   larger   labor   for   filling of   catalyst   particles.     Meanwhile,   when   the   volume   ratio is   larger   than   27/1,   the   effect   of   using   two   or  more kinds   of   catalyst   particles  of   different   volumes   is insufficient,   either;   consequently,   there   arise   inconve¬niences,   for   example,   the   length   of   the   catalyst   layer closest   to   the   raw   material   gas   inlet   of   reactor   tube becomes   very   long,    or   the   catalyst   particles   in   the catalyst   layer  closest   to   the   raw material    gas  outlet   of reactor   tube   become   very   small,   making   large   the   pres¬sure   resistance   in   catalyst   layer.<br>
The   length   of   each   of   the   catalyst   layers (reaction   zones)   formed   in   each   reactor   tube   in   the axial   direction   of   the   tube  can   be   appropriately   deter¬mined   so   that   the   catalyst   particles   produced   as   men¬tioned   above   can   exhibit   the   effect   to   the   maximum extent.      The   length   of   the   catalyst   layer   (wherein   the catalyst   particles   of   largest  volume)   closest   to   the   raw material   gas   inlet   of   reactor   tube   is   generally   10-80%, preferably   15-70%  of   the   total    length   of   all   catalyst 1ayers.<br>
In   the   present   invention,   two   or  more   kinds  of catalyst   particles   of   different   volumes   filled   in   a plurality  of   catalyst   layers   (reaction   zones)   may   con¬tain   the   same   or  different   active  components.      Even  when different   active   components  are   contained   in   different kinds   of   catalyst   particles,   the   temperature  of   hot spots   can   be   kept   lower   by  using   two   or  more   kinds   of catalyst   particles   of   different   volumes,   whereby   the<br><br>
effect   of   the   present   invention   can   be  obtained.      It   is, however,   preferable   that   the  catalyst   particles   filled in  one   catalyst   layer  have  the   same  composition   (contain the  same   active  component),   in   view  of   the   uniformity  of catalytic  activity,   the  operability  of   catalyst,   etc. Therefore,   it   is  preferable  that   the   catalyst  particles of   same   composition   and   substantially   same   volume   are filled   in   one   catalyst   layer.<br>
In   the   present   invention,   the   catalyst   parti¬cles   filled   in   each   catalyst   layer   (reaction   zone)   may be  any   of  a  molded   catalyst  obtained   by molding  an active   component   into  a  desired   shape,   a  supported catalyst   obtained   by  supporting   an   active   component   on an   inert   carrier   having   a   desired   shape,   and   a  combina¬tion   of   the  molded   catalyst   and   the   supported   catalyst. The  shapes  of   the  catalyst   particles   filled   in  each catalyst   layer  may   be   the   same   or  different;   however, the  catalyst   particles   filled   in   one   catalyst   layer   are preferably  molded   catalyst   particles   and/or   supported catalyst   particles   of   same  shape.     When   supported   cata¬lyst   particles   are   used,    the   proportions   of   supported active   components   in  different   catalyst   layers  may  be the  same  or  different;   however,   use  of   the   same  propor¬tion   of   supported   active   component   in   all   catalyst layers   is  generally   advantageous   from   the  standpoints  of catalyst   production   and   catalyst   life.<br>
As   stated   above,    in   the   present   invention, generation   of   hot   spots   or   heat   build-up  in   hot   spots can   be   suppressed   by   filling,   in   each   of   the   reactor tubes,    two  or   more   kinds   of   catalyst   particles  of   dif¬ferent   volumes  each   made   of   a  compound   oxide   represented by   the   above-mentioned   general    formula,   so   as   to   form  a plurality  of   catalyst   layers   in   the   axial   direction   of the   tube   in   such   a   manner   that   the  volume  of   catalyst particle   becomes   smaller   as   the   position  of   catalyst layer   changes   from   the   raw  material   gas   inlet   side  of<br><br>
the  tube   to  the   raw  material   gas  outlet  side;   as   a result,    the   reaction   of   acrylic   acid   production   can   be continued   over   a   long   period   of   time   without   reducing the  yield   of   acrylic  acid   (an   intended   product).<br>
Further   in   the   present   invention,   the   pressure loss   in   catalyst   layers   can   be   made  smaller   than   in   the conventional    process  employing   catalyst  dilution   or other  measures,   by   effectively   using   the  catalyst   parti¬cles  of   large   diameter   (i .e.   D/d  =  2/1   to   15/1);   as  a result,    energy  saving   (e.g.   reduced   electric   power expense   of   blower)   can  be   achieved.<br>
Furthermore   in   the   present   invention,   the temperature   of   hot   spots   in   catalyst   layers   can   be   kept lower   and   the   reaction   can   be  conducted  more   uniformly in   all   catalyst   layers;   as  a   result,    there   is  no   local deterioration   or  damage  of   catalyst   and   an   extended catalyst   life   is  obtained.<br>
The present invention is hereinafter described with reference to Examples. However, the present inven¬tion   is   in   no   way   restricted   to   these   Examples.<br>
In the Examples, "acrolein conversion (mole %)" and "acrylic acid yield (mole %)" were determined from   the   following   formulae.<br>
Acrolein   conversion   (mole %)   =<br>
(moles   of   acrolein   reacted)   -^ (moles   of   acrolein   fed)   x   100<br>
Acrylic   acid   yield   (mole %)   =<br>
(moles   of   acrylic   acid   formed)   -;-(moles   of   acrolein   fed)   x   100<br>
Example   1<br>
In   3,000   ml    of  water   being  stirred   with   heat¬ing,   1,014   g   of   ammonium   paramo 1ybdate   and   224  g   of ammonium  metavanadate  were  dissolved.      Separately,   in 6,000  ml   of   water   being   stirred   with   heating,   231   g   of<br><br>
copper   nitrate,   323   g   of   ammonium  paratungstate   and   20   g of   strontium   nitrate  were   dissolved.      The   resulting   two solutions  were  mixed   and   thoroughly   stirred   with   heating and   then   dried   at   120""C  .      The   resulting  dried   solid  was ground   into   about   100  mesh.     The   resulting   powder   was molded,    by  a   tablet   machine,   into   rings  of   10  mm   (outer diameter)   x   2   mm   (inner  diameter)   x   10  mm   (height)   and rings   of   5  mm   (outer  diameter)   x  2  mm   (inner  diameter)   x 5   mm   (height).     The   two   kinds   of   rings  were   heat-treated at  AOOXJ     for   6   hours   in   an   air   current   to   obtain   a catalyst   1   (rings  of   10  mm  in   outer  diameter)   and   a catalyst   2   (rings  of   5  mm   in   outer  diameter).     These catalysts   had   the   following  metal   composition  when oxygen   was  excluded.<br><br>
These   catalysts  were   filled   in   a  stainless steel-made   reactor   tube  of   25  mm  in   inner   diameter, heated   in   a  molten   nitrate   bath,   in   such   a   manner   that the  catalyst   1   was   closer   to   the   raw   material   gas   inlet of   the   tube   and   formed   a   layer   of   1,000-mm   length   and the  catalyst   2  was   downstream  of   the   catalyst   1   and formed   a   layer   of   2,000-mm  length.     Then,   into   the   tube was   introduced   a   raw material   gas   having   the   following composition,    at   a  space  velocity   (SV)   of   2,000   hr"<br>

A   reaction   started   without   any   abnormality   such   as   run¬away  or   the   like  and   proceeded   stably   for  8000   hours. The  shapes,   volumes   and   volume   ratio  of   the catalysts   1   and   2   used   in   the   reaction   are   shown   in<br><br>
Table   1,   and   the   results   of   the   reaction   are  shown   in Table  2.      Incidentally,   the   temperature  of   the  nitrate bath  used  was   changed   depending   upon   the   reaction   time. Example   2<br>
In   3,000  ml   of  water  being   stirred   with   heat¬ing,   1,014  g   of   ammonium   paramolybdate   and   224  g   of ammonium  metavanadate  were  dissolved.      Separately,   in 6,000  ml   of  water   being   stirred   with   heating,   231   g   of copper   nitrate,   323   g   of   ammonium  paratungstate   and   20   g of   strontium   nitrate  were   dissolved.      The   resulting   two solutions  were  mixed   and   placed   in   a   ceramic  evaporator<br>
containing  2,500   g   of   a  spherical   carrier  made  of   a-<br>
2 alumina   having   a  surface   area  of   1   m   /g  or   less   and   an<br>
average   diameter  of   8  mm.      The   evaporator  was   placed  on a   hot  water   bath   and   the   evaporator  contents  were   evapo¬rated   to   dryness  with   stirring,    to   adhere   the  catalyst components   on   the   carrier.     Then,   the   carrier-supported catalyst   components  were   heat-treated   at  400*^    for  6 hours   in   an   air   current   to  obtain   a  catalyst   3.      A catalyst   4  was   obtained   in   the   same  manner   as   above except   that   the   carrier  was   changed   to   a  spherical carrier   having   an   average   diameter  of   5  mm.<br>
These   catalyst   had   the   same  metal   composition with   catalyst   1   when   oxygen   and   carrier  were  excluded.<br>
An   oxidation   reaction  was   conducted   in   the same  manner   as   in   Example   1   except   that   the   catalysts  3 and   4  were   used   in   place   of   the   catalysts   1   and   2.     The shapes,   volumes   and   volume   ratio  of   the  catalysts   3   and 4   used   in   the   reaction  are  shown   in  Table   1.

Comparative   Example   1<br>
A   reaction   was   conducted   in   the   same  manner  as in   Example   1   except   that   only   the  catalyst   1   was   filled in   the   reactor   tube   so  as   to   form  a   catalyst   layer having   a   length   of   3,000   mm.     The   nitrate   bath   tempera¬ture  was   high   from   the   start   of   the   reaction   and   the acrylic   acid   yield   was   low.     The   nitrate   bath   tempera¬ture  was   increased   in   order   to   keep   the   acrolein   conver¬sion   at   a  desired   level,    in  which   case   the   temperature of   the   nitrate   bath   increased   in   a  short   time.     The results   of   the   reaction   are  shown   in   Table   3. Comparative  Example   2<br>
A   reaction   was   started   in   the   same   manner   as in   Example   1   except   that   only   the  catalyst   2  was   filled in   the   reactor   tube   so   as   to   form  a   catalyst   layer having   a   length   of   3,000   mm.      However,   since   the   temper¬ature  of   hot   spots   of   the   catalyst   layer  exceeded   400X; and   the   reaction   became   unstable,   the   reaction   had   to  be s topped .

A   reaction   was   conducted   in   the   same  manner   as in   Example  2   except   that   only   the  catalyst   3  was   filled in   the   reactor   tube   so   as   to   form  a   catalyst   layer having   a   length  of   3,000   mm.     The   results   of   the   reac¬tion   are   shown   in  Table  3. Comparative  Example   4<br>

However,   since   the   temper¬ature   of   hot   spots   of   the   catalyst   layer  exceeded   4001C and   the   reaction   became   unstable,   the   reaction   had   to  be s topped .<br><br><br><br>

These  catalysts   had   the   following  composition when oxygen   was   excluded.<br><br>
These   catalysts  were   filled   in   a  stainless steel-made   reactor   tube  of   20  mm  in   inner   diameter, heated   in   a  molten   nitrate  bath,   in   such   a   manner   that the  catalyst   5  was   closer   to   the   raw   material   gas   inlet of   the   tube  and   formed  a   layer   of  800-mm  length  and   the catalyst   6  was  downstream   of   the  catalyst   5   and   formed   a layer   of   2,200-mm   length.      Then,   into   the   tube was introduced   a   raw  material    gas   having   the   following composition,    at   a  space  velocity   (SV)   of   2,000   hr"    .<br>

(inner   diameter)   x   8  mm   (length)   and   a   ring-shaped catalyst   9  of   5  mm   (outer   diameter)   x   2   mm   (inner   diame¬ter)   X   5   mm   (length)   were   produced   in   the   same  manner  as in   Example   1   except   that   ferric   nitrate,   barium  nitrate and   cerium  oxide  were   used   as   the   raw   material   for   iron, the   raw   material   for   barium  and   the   raw  material    for cerium,    respectively.     These   catalysts  were   filled   into a   stainless  steel-made   reactor   tube  of  30  mm  in   inner diameter,   heated   in   a  molten   nitrate   bath,    in   such   a manner   that   the   catalyst   7  was   closest   to   the   raw  mate¬rial   gas   inlet   of   the   reactor   tube   and   formed   a  catalyst layer   of   1,000-mm   length,    the   catalyst   8  was   downstream of   the   catalyst   7   and   formed   a   catalyst   layer  of   1,000-mm   length   and   the   catalyst  9  was   downstream   of   the catalyst   8  and   formed   a   catalyst   layer   of   1,000-mm length.      A   reaction   was   conducted   under   the   same   reac¬tion   conditions   as   in   Example   3.

A   reaction   was   conducted   under   the   same  condi¬tions   as   in   Example   1   except   that   only   the   catalyst   12 was   filled   in   the   reactor   tube   so  as   to   form  a  catalyst layer  of   3,000-mm   length.      Also,   a   reaction   was   conduct¬ed   under   the   same   conditions   as   in   Example   1   except   that only   the   catalyst   14 was   filled   in   the   reactor   tube  so as   to   form  a   catalyst   layer  of   3,000-mm  length.      In   each case,   the   temperature   of   the   catalyst   layer   was   high  and there  was   a   fear  of   run-away;   therefore,   it   was   impossi¬ble   to   continue   the   reaction.      Further,   a   reaction  was conducted   under   the   same   conditions   as   in   Example   1 except   that   only   the   catalyst   13 was   filled   in   the   reac¬tor   tube   so   as   to   form  a   catalyst   layer  of   3,000-mm length.      In   this   case,   the   reaction   started   with   no problem   but,   at   the   fifth   day   from   the   start   of   the<br><br>
reaction,   the   acrolein   conversion  was   only   97.5  mole % and   the   acrylic  acid   yield  was   only  89.5  mole %  under the  conditions   of   270°C    (reaction   temperature)   and   330°C (maximum  catalyst   temperature). Example   6<br>
When   a   reaction  was   conducted   in   the  same manner   as   in   Example   1   except   that   the  catalyst   13  was filled   closer   to   the   raw  material   gas   inlet   of   the   tube so  as   to   form   a  catalyst   layer   of   1,000-mm   length   and the  catalyst   14 was   filled   closer   to   the   raw  material gas  outlet   of   the   tube  so   as   to   form   a  catalyst   layer  of 2,000-mm   length,   the   reaction   started   with   no   problem and,   at   the   fifth  day   from   the   start   of   the   reaction, the   acrolein   conversion  was  99.5  mole   %  and   the   acrylic acid   yield  was   94.5   mole   %  under   the   conditions   of   252"C (reaction   temperature)   and   305°C     (maximum   catalyst   tem¬perature).      In   this   case,    the  volume   ratio   of   the   cata¬lyst   13   to   the   catalyst   14  was   4.7/1. Comparative   Example   6<br>
A  catalyst   15  whose   active   component   except oxygen   had   the   following   composition,   was   produced   in the   same  manner  as   in   Example  2   except   that   spherical   a-alumina   of   6   mm  in   diameter  was   used   as   the   carrier. Incidentally,    the   heat-treatment   temperature  employed   in catalyst   production   was   400X1  .<br><br>
Then,    an   oxidation   reaction   was   conducted   in the  same  manner  as   in   Example   1   except   that   only   the catalyst   15  was   used   in   place  of   the   catalyst   1   and   the catalyst   2.      However,   the   temperature   of   the   hot   spots of   the   catalyst   layer  exceeded   380°C    and   the   reaction could   not   be   continued   and  was   stopped.<br>
A  catalyst   16  was   produced   in   the  same  manner as   for   the   catalyst   15  except   that   the   heat-treatment<br><br>
temperature  employed   in   catalyst   production   was   changed to  420°C   .<br>
Then,    an   oxidation   reaction  was   conducted   in the  same  manner   as   in   Example   1   except   that   the   catalyst 15   and   the   catalyst   16 were   used   in   place  of   the   cata¬lyst   1   and   the   catalyst   2   and   that   the   catalyst   16 was filled   in   the   reactor   tube  closer   to   the   raw  material gas   inlet   of   the   tube  so   as   to   form  a   catalyst   layer  of 500-mm   length   and   the   catalyst   15  was   filled   downstream of   the   catalyst   16   so   as   to   form  a  catalyst   layer   of 1,500-mm   length.     Although   the   temperature   of   the   hot spots   of   the   catalyst   layers  was   as   low  as   340°C  ,    the acrolein   conversion   was   99.7  mole %  and   the   acrylic   acid yield  was  89.0  mole   %. Example   7<br>
A  catalyst   17  was   produced   in   the  same  manner as   for   the   catalyst   16  except   that   spherical   a-alumina of  8  mm   in   diameter   was   used   as   the  carrier.     Then,   an oxidation   reaction   was   conducted   in   the  same  manner   as in   Example   1   except   that   the  catalyst   15   and   the   cata¬lyst   17   were   used   in   place  of   the   catalyst   1   and   the catalyst   2   and   that   the   catalyst   17  was   filled   in   the reactor   tube   closer   to   the   raw   material   gas   inlet   of   the tube   so   as   to   form   a  catalyst   layer  of   500-mm  length   and the   catalyst   15 was   filled   downstream   of   the  catalyst   17 so   as   to   form   a  catalyst   layer   of   1,500-mm   length.     As   a result,    the   temperature  of   the   hot   spots   of   the   catalyst layers   was   as   low  as   300t)   ,   and   the  acrolein   conversion was  99.4  mole   %  and   the   acrylic   acid   yield   was  94.2  mole %.      Incidentally,   the  volume   ratio  of   the  catalyst   17   to the   catalyst   15  was   2.4/1 .<br><br><br>
