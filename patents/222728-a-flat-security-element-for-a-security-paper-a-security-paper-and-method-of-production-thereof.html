				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Flat security element<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to a flat security element for a security paper, value<br>
document or the like having a substrate with two opposite main faces, The invention<br>
relates further to a security paper and a value document having such a security element<br>
and to a method for producing a security paper having such a security element.<br>
[0002]	It is known to embed, security elements in the form of threads or bands in se-<br>
curity papers cr value documents, such as back notes, papers of value, identity cards or<br>
other papers at risk of forgery. "Security paper" will hereinafter be understood to mean<br>
paper that is already equipped with security elements such as a watermark, security<br>
thread, hologram patch, etc., but not yet printed, "Value document" will be understood<br>
to mean the printed security paper, e.g. the printed bank note.<br>
[0003]	The security threads or bands are as a rule incorporated into the paper during<br>
papermaking. For example, the security thread is introduced into the paper stock upon<br>
use of a cylinder paper machine and fed to the cylinder in such a way teat the thread is<br>
embedded in the fiber structure of the paper during sheet formation.<br>
[0004]	Methods are also knovm for embedding a security thread in the paper in the<br>
form of a so-called windowed security thread, which is visible in certain areas on the<br>
surface of the paper of value. For example, EP-A 0 059 056 describes a method by<br>
which the security thread is fed to the papermaking screen outside the paper stock in<br>
such, a way that it comes to lie on raised places provided thereon. At the places where<br>
the security thread rests on the raised places no paper can form on the side facing the<br>
screen, so that the security thread is visible in the finished paper at these places.<br>
[0005]	In practice it has turned out in the embedding of security threads with differ-<br>
ent widths that sheet formation is impaired above and below the thread by the drain-<br>
age-inhibiting effect of the thread. This effect increases with the thread width and of-<br>
ten leads to defects, such as holes, in the paper in the case of wide threads. To obtain<br>
sufficient sheet quality, the method known from EP-A-0 059 056 is therefore limited<br>
to the embedding of threads with a width up to about 1 mm to 1.5 mm,<br><br><br>
-2-<br>
[0006]	To permit embedding of security bands with a width up to about 4 mm, it is<br>
therefore proposed in the print EP-A-0 625 431 to deliberately accept the defects ap-<br>
pearing only on the back of the later security paper when using bands that are not too<br>
wide, and to cover them with one or two fault-free paper layers in a subsequent<br>
method step. This always ensures a minimum paper thickness even in the area of the<br>
defects, which conveys to the viewer a homogeneous impression of the paper surface.<br>
[0007]	In almost all security and bank-note papers, a thread coated with heat seal<br>
lacquer is incorporated into the paper on the paper machine as the security thread, to-<br>
day. The heat peal lacquer serves to improve the anchorage of the thread in the paper.<br>
The width of these threads typically made of PET film is up to 3 mm, in rare cases also<br>
between 3 mm and 4 mm.<br>
[0008]	Fault-free sheet formation is increasingly impeded primarily with threads<br>
having a width of 3.5 mm or more. As a result so-callud thread streaks appear, where<br>
the paper ply no longer forms a completely closed fiber structure in the area of the<br>
thread. The choice of thread and the thread design are therefore limited in practice to<br>
widths up to about 4,0 mm.<br>
[0009]	On these premises, die present invention is based on the problem of specify-<br>
ing a security element that avoids the disadvantages of the prior art. In particular, it<br>
should be possible to incorporate the security element into security papers or value<br>
documents reliably and with little effort, even if it has a large width, or large surface<br>
area, in such a way as to yield a uniform and unimpaired appearance without defects.<br>
[0010]	This problem is solved by the security element having the features of the<br>
main, claim. A security paper, a value document as well as a method for producing a<br>
security paper are the subject matter of the coordinated claims. Developments of the<br>
invention are the subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
[0011]	According to the invention, at least one main face of the substrate is pro-<br>
vided with a three-dimensionally structured coating in the security element of the type<br>
stated at the outset.<br><br><br>
- 3 -<br>
[0012]	According to the invention, the three-dimensionally structured coating may<br>
be a fiber coating, a foamed, embossed and/or filled coating.<br>
[0013]	In an advantageous, embodiment at least one main, surface is provided with a<br>
fiber coating. Said fiber coating is integrated into the fibrous mesh of the paper during<br>
papermaking so as to prevent the paper ply from thinning in the area of the security<br>
element as known from the prior art.<br>
[0014]	The fiber coaling is preferably formed by a textile fabric, in particular a<br>
woven, a knit, a felt, a nonwoven, or a flocking with or coating of single fibers. It is<br>
also possible to use a closed fiber material, such as paper, in particular cotton paper.<br>
The fabrics can be formed directly from the fibers, as in the case of felts or nonwov-<br>
ens, or from yarns, as in the case of wovens, knits or braids. A woven designates here<br>
a fabric produced by the interlacing of at least two different thread systems (warp and<br>
weft), while in knits the thread or threads are entwined in meshed loops. Felts are me-<br>
chanically consolidated, woven, sheets or fibrous webs. Nonwovens refer to nonwoven<br>
fabrics with usually randomly oriented fibers whose cohesion can already be given by<br>
the fibersT own. adhesion. Furthermore, the nonwovens can also be mechanically or<br>
chemically consolidated.<br>
[0015]	According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the fiber coating<br>
comprises synthetic fiber raw materials, in particular selected from the group of vis-<br>
cose, aramid, PVAL (polyvinyl alcohols), PET (polyethylene terephthalates), PA<br>
(polyamides) and polyolefins, preferably PP (polypropylenes).<br>
[0016]	According to a Likewise preferred embodiment of the invention, the fiber<br>
coating comprises natural fibers, in particular selected from, the group of wool, silk,<br>
cotton, plant fibers, paper fibers and cellulose.<br>
[0017]	The fiber coating can also comprise bicomponent fibers or multicomponent<br>
fibers, in particular made of the stated synthetic fiber raw materials or natural fibers.<br>
[0018]	Obviously, the stated fibers can also appear in the fiber coating in combina-<br>
tion. For example, a partial area of the substrate of the security element can be coated<br><br><br>
-4-<br>
with synthetic fibers, another partial area with natural fibers. In particular, the two<br>
main faces of the substrate can be provided with different fiber coatings.<br>
[0019]	According to an expedient embodiment of the invention, the fiber coating<br>
comprises a fibrous mat with a low weight per unit area, in particular with a weight per<br>
unit area of 8 to 30 g/m2 or less, preferably of l5 g/m2 or less.<br>
[00201	According to another advantageous embodiment, the fiber coating comprises<br>
a woven with weft and warp threads made of different material. Expediently, one of<br>
the material threads is water-soluble. A fibrous mat or a fiber knit made of fibers with<br>
different diameter and/or different titer can also be advantageously used.<br>
[0021]	Expediently, the fiber coating is connected to the substrate via an adhesive<br>
layer. The adhesives used may be for example solvent-based adhesives, dispersions,<br>
hot-melts, heat seal lacquers, synthetic 1C and 2C adhesives, ionomers, styrene acry-<br>
lates and mixtures thereof,<br>
[0022]	According to an advantageous development of the invention, the fiber coat-<br>
ing is provided with an adhesive coating, in particular a heat-activable adhesive or a<br>
hot-melt adhesive, for embedding the security element in a security paper, value<br>
document or the like. The fiber coating can also bave a hydrophtlic coating as an addi-<br>
tional coating. It may likewise be expedient to increase the polarity of the fibers by a<br>
corona or plasma pretreatmeat before embedding in the security paper or value docu-<br>
ment to obtain an improved bond with the stock, fibers.<br>
[0023]	In a further advantageous embodiment, the three-dimensionally structured<br>
coating is an embossed coating. The embossed coating may be a heat-activable adhe-<br>
sive or a non-heat-activable adhesive, such as PUR, or non-heat-activable films, such<br>
as PA, PET, PP The coating preferably comprises a heat-activable hot-melt adhesive.<br>
The embossing is produced e.g. by means of a structured embossing roll. The depti of<br>
the embossing is between about 1 to 10 m, preferably about 3 to 6 m. The emboss-<br>
ing supports the depositing of fibers from the paper stock on the security element. The<br>
embossing is preferably equatized again in the press or dryer section or the smoothing<br><br><br>
-5-<br>
machine, that is, after the actual sheet formation. The adhesives to be used are the<br>
above-mentioned adhesives.<br>
[0024]	In a further advantageous embodiment, the three-dimensionally structured<br>
coating is a foamed coating. The coating is in particular a heat-activable hot-melt ad-<br>
hesive or a film, such as HDPE, PP, OPP, PET, PA, which has been foamed e.g. by<br>
carbonates, hydrogenearbonates or other foarning agents. The pore structure present in<br>
the coating permits the depositing and penetration of fibers from the paper stock on the<br>
security element. Upon use of an adhesive, the pore sizes preferably range from about<br>
1 to 200 m, especially preferably from 40 to 50 m. Upon use of foamed films, the<br>
pore sizes preferably range from about 50 to 500 m, especially preferably from about<br>
30 to 100 m, The pore structure is preferably equalized again, in the press or dryer<br>
section or the smoothing machine upon use of meheat-activable hot-melt adhesive,<br>
while the foaming is preferably retained upon use of a film.<br>
[0025]	In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the three-<br>
dimensionally structured coating is a filled coating. The coating is preferably a film,<br>
e.g. HDPE, PP, OPP, PET, PA, which has fillers. The fillers used are advantageously<br>
chalk, SiO2, A12O3, TiO2, ZrO2, talc, Acrosil, MgO or BaSO4, The particle size pref-<br>
erably ranges up to about 40 m in diameter. The filler content based on the film pref-<br>
erably ranges from about 5 to 20 wt%, The fillers preferably lead to a roughening of<br>
the film, which mates it more difficult for the fibers from the paper stock to run off the<br>
security element.<br>
[0026]	The inventive three-dimensionally structared coating can advantageously be<br>
additionally equipped with water-soluble properties. For example, a surface-structured<br>
PYA coating can be present in the security element. In the wet section of the paper<br>
machine the PVA coating is partially dissolved and prevents the pulp from washing<br>
away by integrating fibers from the paper stock. Sheet formation in the film area is<br>
thus facilitated<br>
[0027]	It is of course also possible to combine the individual above-described in-<br>
ventive embodiments.<br><br><br>
-6-<br>
[0028]	In an advantageous "variant of the invention, only one main face of the sub-<br>
strate is prorvided with a three-damensionally structured coating. This variant is used in<br>
particular when the seciarity element is embedded in a security paper or value docu-<br>
ment in the manner of a. windowed security thread.<br>
[0029]	If the security element is embedded in the paper all over, it has proved espe-<br>
cially expedient if both, main faces of Sue substrate are provided with a three-<br>
tlimensionally structured coating. The main faces can be provided either with similar<br>
coatings or with different coatings.<br>
[0030]	The main face(s) of the substrate are expediently provided with, the three-<br>
dimensionally structured coating all over for optimal embedding. Depending on the<br>
size of the security element, however, it may also suffice to provide the coating on<br>
only a partial area of the substrate thereof, for example an edge area.<br>
[0031]	It is also possible to apply a coating in sections on one side or a coating al-<br>
ternating on the two main faces. For further support of the anchorage of the security<br>
element in the paper, the security element can additionally be designed with perfora-<br>
tions, preferably in the edge area of the element.<br>
[0032]	In a preferred embodiment, the security element is designed in the form of a<br>
security band which is intended for complete or partial embedding in a security paper<br>
or value document.. The security band is designed in particular in the form of a rectan-<br>
gular band with length L and width B, the tength L as a role corresponding to a typical<br>
dimension of the security paper in which the security element is embedded. The inven-<br>
tive solution shews special advantages if the security band is formed with a width, of<br>
about 4 mm to about 20 mm,<br>
[0033]	In other, likewise advantageous embodiments, the security element is de-<br>
signed in the form of a security stripe, a patch or another flat element. During produc-<br>
tion of a security paper the flat element is preferably applied to the still moist paper<br>
web, so that the fibers of the paper web can mesh with the fibers of the coating.<br><br><br>
-7-<br>
[0034]	To further increase the falsification security, the security element can be<br>
equipped with an optically variable effect, in particular a diffraction, pattern, a. holo-<br>
gram, a color shift effect or other interference effects,<br>
[0035]	According to another preferred embodiment the security element is pro-<br>
vided with a printed image or with positive or negative gaps in an opaque layer, e.g. a<br>
metal layer, in the form of patterns or characters. The security element can also contain<br>
fluorescent substances, phosphorescent substances or magnetic, substances as a farther<br>
security feature. In all these embodiments, additional design options result compared<br>
to conventional security threads due to the greater possible width of the security ele-<br>
ment. For example, large-area print designs, such as flags, architectural motifs or por-<br>
traits, can be used on a security band for the first time.<br>
[0036]	The invention also comprises a security paper for producing security or<br>
value documents, such as bank notes, identity cards or the like, which is equipped with<br>
an above-described security element, as well as a value document having such a secu-<br>
rity element. The security element can be completely embedded in the security paper<br>
or value document. Alternatively, the security element is embedded in the security pa-<br>
per or value document in the manner of a windowed security thread and is visible in<br>
window areas of the security paper or value document on the surface thereof. These-<br>
curity clement can also form a pendulating security thread, which appears alternatingly<br>
on opposite surfaces of the security paper or value document.<br>
[0037]	To make the security element inside the security paper or value document as<br>
unobtrusive as possible in reflected light, the three-dimensional structuring of the secu-<br>
rity element surface can be selected so that it bas substantially the same optical ap-<br>
pearance as the paper substrate in which the security element is embedded, In particu-<br>
lar, the fiber costing can have the same color as the paper substrate. If a fiber coating<br>
with an optically divergent appearance is alternatively selected, the contrast between<br>
security element and paper substrate can also be used deliberately as a design element.<br>
[0038]	In a method for producing a security paper of the described type, a paper<br>
web is formed in a first method step, a security band with a substrate with, two oppo-<br>
site main faces being embedded completely or partly in the paper during sheet forma-<br><br><br>
-8-<br>
tion. According to the invention, at least one surface of a main face of the substrate is<br>
provided with a three-dimensional structure, in. particular a fiber coating, before em-<br>
bedding,<br>
[0039]	According to preferred embodiments, the substrate of the security band is<br>
flocked or coated with single fibers or laminated with a fiber coating in the form of a<br>
textile fabric, in particular a woven, a knit, a felt or a noawoven. It is advantageous to<br>
use here the synthetic fiber raw materials or natural fibers that are mentioned above,<br>
[0040]	For improved embedding of the security band in the security paper, the fiber<br>
coating is preferably provided with an adhesive coating. The fiber coating can also be<br>
provided with a hydrophilic coating, or the polarity of the fibers can be increased by a<br>
corona or plasma pretreatment to improve the embedding.<br>
[0041]	Further embodiments as well as advantages of die invention will be ex-<br>
plained hereinafter with reference to the figures. For more clarity, the figures do with-<br>
out a representation that is true to scale and to proportion.<br>
Fig, 1		shows a schematic representation of a bank note with a wide windowed se-<br>
		curity band according to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
Fig. 2		shows the windowed security band of Fig. 1 in cross section along the line<br>
		II-II, and<br>
Fig. 3		shows a security band according to another embodiment of the invention in<br>
		cross section.<br>
[0042]	The invention will be explained hereafter by the example of a bank note<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a bank note 10 with an embedded wide<br>
windowed security band 12 in a front view. The windowed security band 12 appears<br>
on the surface of the bank note 10 at window areas 14, while it is embedded inside the<br>
bank note 10 in the areas 16 there between.<br>
[0043]	The windowed security band 12 has a width of about 15 mm in this em-<br>
bodiment. To permit such a wide security band to be embedded in the bank note 10<br><br><br>
-9-<br>
without thread streaks, the windowed security band 12 is provided with a fiber coating<br>
on its underside. Fig. 2 shows schematically the structure of the windowed security<br>
band 12, A fibrous mat 22, in the embodiment a cotton mat, with a weight per unit area<br>
of about 15 g/m2 is applied to a PET substrate film 20. The fibrous mat 22 is firmly<br>
connected to the substrate 20 via an adhesive layer of heat seal lacquer.<br>
[0044]	The windowed security band 12 is embedded, in the paper web in the way<br>
known in the art during production of the security paper for the bank note 10. The fi-<br>
brous mat 22 bereases the adhesion of the cellulose fibers to the surface of. the secu-<br>
rity band. 12 and leads to closed sheet formation, despite the large width of the band,<br>
via the considerably improved embedding of the security band 12 in the fiber bond of<br>
the security paper. The security band 12 can be equipped with further security features<br>
not shown in the figure, for example a hologram element or a print design.<br>
[0045]	Fig. 3 shows a security band 30 for complete embedding in a security paper<br>
according to another embodiment of the invention. The security band 30 contains a<br>
PET or OPP substrate film 32 which is provided with a fiber coating 34, 36 on each<br>
side. In this embodiment the fiber coating is formed by a laminated knit of aramid fi-<br>
bers on each side. Further adhesive layers 38 and 40 on the fiber coatings 34 and 36<br>
serve to strengthen the anchorage of the wide security band 30 in a security paper.<br>
[0046]	The described security hand can be incorporated into a paper web not only<br>
with a cylinder paper machine. With a fourdrinier paper machine the security band can<br>
be supplied accordingly shortly before or shortly after the paper fiber layer leaves the<br>
screen in the same way as with a cylinder paper machine.<br><br><br>
