PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to skin-lancing devices and is more specifically directed to a skin lancing device having an improved endcap for more effective lancing and more efficient vacuum formation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lancing devices are used for obtaining capillary blood from body sites. A typical user of a lancing device is a person in a program of self-blood-glucose-monitoring for treatment of diabetes. Such a user presses an endcap of the lancing device at a selected puncture site, activates the lancing device to puncture the skin at the site, and draws capillary blood for testing. To rriinimrze any discomfort caused by the puncture, the lancing device typically controls the depth of the puncture, quickly withdraws the lancet from the skin once a puncture has been made, and prevents the lancet from rebounding and reentering the puncture or causing a second puncture. Once a puncture has been made, the lancing device remains on the site and a vacuum is created to draw skin partially into an end cap of the device. As this occurs, a small amount of blood forms on the skin at the puncture site. The vacuum is then released and the lancing device is removed from the skin. The drop of blood on the surface of the skin at the puncture site is then applied to a test sensor.<br>
Some lancing devices include a gasket connected to the lancet that reciprocates in the lancing device as the lancet moves through a lancing stroke. The gasket is in airtight contact with the inside of the lancing device such that as the gasket slides within the lancing device, air is displaced and a vacuum is created.<br>
It is desirable that lancing devices be as comfortable as possible to use. Further, it is desirable for a lancing device to have accurate placement and puncture depth for the lance, so that an appropriate amount of blood collects with only one lancing operation, decreasing or eliminating the possibility that a second lancing operation will be necessary. Additionally, it is desirable for a lancing device to create and<br>
-2-<br><br>
maintain sufficient vacuum for a drop of blood of a predictable volume to collect. The present invention is directed to an improved lancing device endcap.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An endcap according to one embodiment of the present invention is provided with a<br>
cqntoured skin-contact surface to facilitate the drawing of skin into the endcap .<br>
The contour of an endcap according to the present invention preferably includes a narrowing skin-receiving area that causes skin to bulge within the skin-receiving area, preparing the skin for puncturing by a lance to a desired puncture depth.<br>
Increased contact between skin and a lancing device endcap according to some embodiments of the present invention increases the effectiveness and duration of vacuum formation within a vacuum cavity.<br>
Additional features of the present invention will be more fully understood ixpon reference to the figures.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a side view of a lancing device according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a side cutaway view of an endcap for a lancing device according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 3a-3d are time elapse images of use of a lancing device having an endcap<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms,<br>
specific embodiments are shown by way of example in the drawings and will be<br>
described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is<br>
not' intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is<br>
to cover' all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
-3-<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to FIG. 1, a vacuum-assisted lancing device 10 is shown according to one embodiment of the present invention. A vacuum member, such as a diaphragm (not shown), within the lancing device 10 is activated when the plunger 12 is depressed by the user and travels toward the open end 14 of the lancing device 10.<br>
As the plunger 12 is depressed, a rebound spring (not shown) within the housing 16 of the lancing device 10 is expanded and extended and the diaphragm (not shown) is displaced toward the endcap 18. As the plunger 12 is depressed farther, a lance 20, such as a sterile needle lance, quickly extends out of the open end 14 of the lancing device 10 and is then quickly retracted within the endcap 18. Following the lancing operation, a vacuum is formed within a vacuum cavity 22 by the movement of the diaphragm within the lancing device 10. The vacuum cavity 22 is bounded by the inner surfaces of the endcap 18 and by the surface 23 of skin against which the endcap 18 is placed. Further details of operation of lancing devices according to some embodiments of the present invention will be understood with reference to U.S. Patent No. 6,152,942 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. According to an alternative embodiment, a puncturing process starts when sufficient pressure has been exerted between the endcap and the skin surface 23 to initiate the puncture.<br>
The endcap 18 of the present invention is provided with features that improve the performance of the lancing device 10. FIG. 2 is a cutaway side view of an endcap 18 according to one embodiment of the present invention. The endcap 18 is provided with a cylindrical cavity wall 24 at a first portion 26 of the endcap 18, The first portion 26 of the endcap attaches to the housing 16 of the lancing device (shown in FIG. 1). The first portion 26 of the endcap 18 may attach to the housing 16 of the lancing device in a variety of ways (for example, via friction-fit, snap-on, or screw-on connections). The endcap 18 is attached to the housing so that a vacuum may be maintained within the internal volume of the endcap. An O-ring, for example, may be placed between the endcap and an endcap-mating surface of the housing 16 of the lancing device to result in creation and maintenance of a substantially airtight<br>
-4-<br><br>
connection allowing formation of a vacuum within the internal volume of the endcap. It is preferable for a mating surface between the endcap 18 and the housing 16 to allow for adjustment of puncture depth.<br>
The second portion 28 of the endcap 18 is narrower than the first portion 26 of the endcap 18. A skin-contact surface 30 slopes inwardly from an outer wall 32 along a blunt skin-contact edge 34. The skin-contact surface 30 is widest at the skin-contact edge 34 and gradually narrows from the open end 14 of the lancing device to an inner wall 36. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the skin-contact surface 30 follows a parabolic contour from the skin-contact edge 34 to a linear inner wall 36. Other contours, such as circular contours, may be used to form the skin-contact surface 30. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the skin-contact surface has a cross-section that approximates an arc of a circle having a radius R of approximately 3.89 mm. According to other embodiments, the radius R may range from approximately 1.5 mm to approximately 6 mm.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the inner volume of the first portion 26 of the endcap 18 has a diameter dj and the inner volume of the second portion 28 of the endcap has a diameter d2. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the diameter dj of the inner volume of the first portion 26 of the endcap is approximately 19 mm and the diameter d2 of the inner volume of the second portion 28 of the endcap is approximately 7 mm. The skin-contact surface 30 narrows from a widest diameter dw at the skin-contact edge 34, through an intermediate diameter dt to a narrowest diameter dn at the inner wall 36 of the second portion 28 of the endcap. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the widest diameter dw is approximately 13 mm, the intermediate diameter dt is approximately 10 nun, and the narrowest diameter dn is approximately 7 mm. It is to be understood that larger or smaller diameters may be employed in other embodiments of the present invention. Smaller diameters, such as the diameter shown in FIG. 2, are preferred in some embodiments because they allow for lancing to be done as fingertips as well as other sites, such as the forearms. Wider minimum diameters, such as approximately 10 mm or 13 mm,<br>
-5-<br><br>
for the narrowest diameter dn may be used, as may smaller diameters such as approximately 5 mm. According to some embodiments, diameters dn of from approximately 7 mm to approximately 10 mm are used.<br>
The operation of an endcap 18 according to the present invention will be more completely understood with reference to FIGS. 3a to 3d, which show a time-elapse progression of a puncturing operation. In FIG. 3a, the endcap 18 has been placed against a skin surface 23, resulting in a bulge 38 of the skin surface 23 due to pressure against the skin surface 23. The contour of the skin-contact surface 30 causes bunching up of the skin surface 23 within the open end 14 of the endcap 18, positioning the skin surface 23 for lancing by the lance 20. The lance 20 has not yet been driven toward the skin surface 23 in FIG. 3a.<br>
Turning to FIG. 3b, the lance 20 has been driven beneath the skin surface 23 at a puncture site 40 where the greatest depth of skin has entered the vacuum cavity 22 of the endcap 18. The contour of the skin-contact surface 30 provides a predictable and repeatable bunching of skin within the vacuum cavity 22. As a result, the puncture depth to which the lance 20 is driven beneath the skin surface 23 is easily controlled and ke=pt at approximately the same depth with repeated lancing operations. Puncture depth is controlled to reduce pain and injury at the site. According to some embodiments, puncture depths between approximately 1 mm and 2 mm are preferred.<br>
In FIG. 3c, the lance 20 has been withdrawn from the skin surface 23 acrid a vacuum is formed within the vacuum cavity 22. As a result, the bulge 38 of the skin surface 23 has increased and a blood sample 42 has begun to collect at the puncture site 40. The vacuum facilitates blood flow at the puncture site 40. Because the contotir of the skin-contact surface 30 approximately matches the contour of the skin surface 23 as it forms the bulge 38, the vacuum formed within the vacuum cavity 22 will have lower pressure, more reliability, and longer duration than a vacuum formed with an endcap that makes less contact with the skin surface 23. Finally, as shown in FIG. 3d,<br>
-6-<br><br>
the vacuum is maintained within the vacuum cavity 22 and the blood sample 42 continues to grow in size following retraction of the lance 20. Throughout the process, the rounded skin contact edge 34 increases comfort for the user as compared to endcaps having sharper angles. This is important in embodiments in which pressure is placed on the skin to create and maintain a vacuum within the endcap.<br>
Endcaps according to the present invention are capable of maintaining a vactium pressure of -10 mm Hg for six seconds or longer. Further, the control of puncture depth limits the amount of pain and injury associated with the puncture while providing an adequate blood sample. Reduced pain and injury promotes increased testing and the improved feedback results in better control of blood sugar.<br>
Endcaps according to the present invention may be made of a variety of materials. It is preferable for endcaps according to the present invention to be transparent, enaloling a user to view the collection of a blood sample 42 and to withdraw the endcap from the skin surface when a sufficient volume of blood has been collected. It is preferred for endcaps according to the present invention to be disposable and easily attached to and removed from a lancing device.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. DEach of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims.<br>
