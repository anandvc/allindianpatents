Filter element for a disc filter<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a filter element for use in a disc filter for filtering<br>
liquid containing particles, wherein a plurality of filter elements is arranged on a rotor<br>
shaft in a manner allowing liquid communication between the inside of the filter<br>
elements and the inside of the rotor shaft, for filtering liquids. The filter element<br>
comprises a framework or structure carrying filter cloth on both side surfaces.<br>
Background<br>
When filtering is to take place from the inside out, the rotor shaft has a hollow core<br>
and liquid to be filtered is fed to the inside of the rotor shaft. The filter element and<br>
the rotor shaft have suitable openings through which the liquid to be filtered is fed to<br>
the inside of the filter element. The filtering takes place from the inside of the filter<br>
element and out though the filter cloth. Particles in the liquid are separated on the<br>
inside of the filter cloth.<br>
A plurality of filter elements is attached to the rotor shaft around the periphery<br>
thereof, together forming filter discs. The rotor shaft is usually capable of carrying a<br>
plurality of such discs.<br>
During operation, the rotor shaft carrying the filter discs is rotated and the filter discs<br>
are partially immersed in filtered liquid during rotation. The liquid level inside the filter<br>
discs is higher than the liquid level outside the filter discs. Particles separated on the<br>
inside of the filter cloth are rinsed away with the help of spray nozzles placed so that<br>
the jets of liquid from the nozzles hit the outside of the filter cloth when the filter cloth<br>
is in the air. The particles are rinsed away and flow through the filter element and into<br>
the rotor shaft, where they are caught in a reject trough.<br>
The filter element according to the present invention can also be used in disc filters<br>
for filtering from the outside of the filter discs and into the rotor shaft, wherein<br>
particles are deposited on the outside of the filter cloth and the filtered liquid flows<br>
into the rotor shaft. A reject trough can be arranged on the outside of the filter discs<br>
 <br>
to catch reject that has been rinsed away, so that this can be rinsed down and<br>
"creamed off.<br>
Usually known filter elements consist of a framework or structure over which a bag of<br>
filter cloth is treaded and crimped, or a framework and replaceable panels of filter<br>
cloth. The basic thought is that the framework is reused.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a filter element which is simple and cost-<br>
efficient to manufacture, has light weight, and is easy to replace.<br>
The present invention fulfils this object by a filter element as initially described, where<br>
the framework and the filter cloth are permanently joined forming a single use filter<br>
element, wherein the filter element has at least one passage in each edge for liquid<br>
communication between the inside of adjacent filter elements when the filter<br>
elements are assembled edge to edge forming a filter disc.<br>
A filter element according to the invention consists of a single component, whereas a<br>
conventional filter element for disc filters consists of at least two parts when the bag<br>
type is concerned, and at least four components in the type having replaceable filter<br>
cloth panels, i.e. a frame, two replaceable filter cloth panels and a lid which locks the<br>
filter cloth panels in place.<br>
The passages on the edges cause liquid and gas to flow between the filter elements<br>
during rotation of the filter discs. This facilitates filling and emptying the filter<br>
elements, facilitates filtering, and results in increased capacity.<br>
The filter element according to the invention is preferably manufactured entirely in<br>
one or more polymeric materials, allowing rational manufacture. The filter element is<br>
much lighter than the conventional filter element, making it possible to build the rotor<br>
shaft with reduced wall thickness compared to the conventional case and to operate<br>
the filter at less expense.<br>
Another advantage is that the filter element is easier to replace due to its low weight.<br>
Also, it does not require as complicated fastening as conventional filter elements and<br>
is thus much easier to replace, for example if the filter media is damaged. As the filter<br>
 <br>
element according to the invention can be manufactured entirely of polymeric<br>
materials, it can be easily disposed of, e.g., by incineration.<br>
A filter element according to one embodiment of the invention is attachable to the<br>
rotor shaft through a single fastening organ. It is kept in place by an attachment<br>
organ comprising a long bolt and nut, which works well as the filter element has low<br>
weight.<br>
In the above embodiment of the filter element, a seal can be arranged between the<br>
filter element and the rotor shaft, and a seal can be arranged around the passage to<br>
the adjacent filter element on one edge only. Using only two seals compared to four,<br>
as conventionally used, minimizes the risk for leakage of unfiltered liquid into filtered<br>
liquid.<br>
One embodiment of the filter element preferably has a width between the side<br>
surfaces of filter cloth between 1.15 to 1.40 times the width of a passage for liquid<br>
communication in the rotor shaft. As the filter elements have a narrow construction, a<br>
more compact disc filter is made possible, meaning that more filter discs can be<br>
arranged on the same rotor shaft compared to disc filters assembled from<br>
conventional filter elements. This results in a significantly higher capacity of the disc<br>
filter.<br>
According to the present invention, a disc filter assembled from filter elements<br>
according to the invention is also provided.<br>
Short description of the drawings<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a disc filter 1 having a plurality of filter elements 2 arranged on a rotor<br>
shaft 3 and forming a filter disc 25. Liquid communication can take place between the<br>
inside 4 of the filter elements 2 and the inside 5 of the rotor shaft 3 through at least<br>
one cutout or opening 9 in the rotor shaft 3 and at least one cutout or opening 10 in<br>
the filter element 2. Fig. 2 shows the filter element 2 comprising a framework 6, which<br>
carries filter cloth 7 on both its side surfaces 8, see also Fig. 4. The framework 6 and<br>
the filter cloth 7 are permanently joined so that the filter element 2 forms a single use<br>
filter element 2.<br>
The framework 6 preferably comprises a frame 11, a crossbar 12 for each side<br>
surface 8 and a central support 13 extending from the outer part 14 of the frame 11,<br>
forming a part of the periphery of the filter disc 25 when in use, to a connecting part<br>
15, adjacent to the rotor shaft 3 when in use. The filter element 2 is preferably<br>
manufactured in its entirety of one or more polymeric materials. This term should also<br>
be considered to include reinforced polymeric materials or similar materials mainly<br>
consisting of a polymer. The term also includes filter element that comprise minor<br>
parts, such as screws, made of a different material, such as a metal.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a fastening organ 16 comprising a long bolt 17 and a nut 18. The long<br>
bolt 17 is threaded in both ends. When the filter element 2 is fastened to the rotor<br>
shaft 3, the long bolt 17 is threaded through a hole 19 and along the central support<br>
13. The filter element is kept in the desired place on the rotor shaft 3 and the long<br>
bolt 17 is screwed in place in a threaded opening 20 in the rotor shaft 3, and<br>
thereafter the bolt 18 is screwed in place in the part of the long bolt 17 protruding<br>
through the hole 19. In this fashion the filter element 2 can be fastened to the rotor<br>
shaft 3 using only one fastening organ 16.<br>
The framework 6 of the filter element 2 has at least one passage 21 in each edge 22<br>
for liquid communication between the inside 4 of adjacent filter elements 2 in<br>
assembled position when the filter elements 2 are arranged edge 22 to edge 22<br>
 <br>
forming a filter disc 25. Similarly, the central support 13 has at least one passage 21.<br>
The inside 4 of the filter element thereby forms one single compartment for fluids.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a first seal 23 arranged between the filter element 2 and the rotor shaft<br>
3 and a second seal 24 arranged around the passage 21 to the adjacent filter<br>
element 2 on one edge 22 only.<br>
The width between the side surfaces 8 of filter cloth 7 are between 1.15 and 1.40<br>
times the width of an opening 9 for liquid communication in the rotor shaft 3.<br>
Experiments have shown that an opening 9 of 55 mm in the rotor shaft 3 requires a<br>
width of at least 65 mm of the filter element 2 according to the invention, whereas the<br>
same 55 mm opening requires a width of at least 90 mm in the conventional filter<br>
element.<br>
Preferred embodiments of a filter element and a disc filter have been described. It will<br>
be appreciated that these can be varied with the scope of the appended claims<br>
without departing from the inventive idea.<br>
