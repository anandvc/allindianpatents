A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to communication interface for executing different types of communication protocols and more particularly relates to a multi communication interface that can be attached to a motherboard to enable the attachment of several communication protocols of different standards to establish any type of communication protocol easily.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The Communication is the activity of conveying information. A data channel is<br>
used to transfer a digital information data in a serial fashion i.e. one bit after the other<br>
over one wire or fiber or a communication channel. The serial port on a personal<br>
computer (PC) is a serial interface that is typically used to attach modems and data<br>
acquisition terminals.<br>
[0003] In the telecommunications and the computer science field, the serial communications is the process of sending data one bit at one time sequentially over the communication channels or computer bus.<br>
[0004]  The establishment of communication  between  objects that run  in  different<br>
■h<br>
processes whether on the same computer or across the Internet is a common development<br><br>
goal, especially during the building of the widely distributed applications. Traditionally, this has required in-depth knowledge not only of the objects on either end of the communication stream, but also of a host of lower-level protocols, application programming interfaces, and configuration tools or files.<br>
[0005] The communication protocols are widely used communication interfaces in data acquisition and control applications where multiple nodes communicate with each other. A communications protocol is the set of standard rules for data representation, signaling, authentication and error detection required to send information over a communications<br>
L<br>
channel. An example of a simple communications protocol adapted to voice communication is the case of a radio dispatcher talking to mobile stations. The communication protocols for digital computer network communication have many features intended to ensure reliable interchange of data over an imperfect communication channel. Communication protocol is basically following certain rules so that the system works properly.<br>
[0006] The currently available communication protocol involves use of different hardware components for communication based on the type of communication used to transmit data between the units in equipment. The different types of communication<br><br>
protocols are RS485, RS232, RS423, and RS422.<br>
[0007] The Electronic data communications between elements will generally fall into two broad categories: single-ended and differential. The examples of the different types of<br><br>
communication standard that are currently available are RS 485/RS 422 and RS 232/RS 423 etc. RS 485 and RS 232 are serial communication methods generally used in computers and network based devices. The RS 485 is a 2-wire differential, multi-drop (32 nodes) communication standard used for a distance up to 400 ft. The communication defined in the RS 232 standard is an asynchronous, single ended and serial communication method. The word serial means that the information is sent by one bit at a time. Many current applications for RS 232 use the electrical standard 3 wires [TXD (transmitting), RXD (receiving) and common pin] and connector pin-out. While the standard supports only low data rates and short line length (up to 50 ft), it is still widely used and very useful in many applications.<br>
[0008] The hardware component and the communication circuitry are different for different  communication   protocols,   depending  on  the  communication   requirement.<br>
However the input for these communication protocols are acquired from a common<br>
:<br>
source, say from a base main board. Thus the utility device should have different hardware components to execute the different communication protocols based on the communication requirement. As a result, the size and cost of the device are high, based<br>
on the communication requirement. Hence the different communication interfaces are to<br><br>
be connected with a mother board to transfer the data to the pluralities of units and to receive the data from the multiple units.<br><br>
[0009] So there is a need for a single common communication interface provided in a mother board which can be connected to the daughter/child boards of different communication interfaces respectively to carry out a desired communication protocol.<br>
C) OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The primary object of the invention is to provide a single common communication interface in a mother board which may be connected to daughter/child boards of different<br>
communication interfaces to carry out a communication using a desired communication<br>
f protocol based on the requirement.<br>
[0011] Another object of the invention is to provide a single common communication interface in the mother board to connect the child/daughter cards of different communication standards to execute the multiple communication protocols easily and efficiently thereby eliminating the need for redundant and excessive communication components in the motherboard to reduce the size and the cost of the device.<br>
[0012]  An   additional   object  of the   invention   is  to   provide  a  single  common<br>
i<br>
communication interface in the mother board to connect the child/daughter cards of different communication! standards to execute the multiple communication protocols easily and to save the resources used for the different communication protocols by removing the redundant or excessive communication components in the motherboard thereby reducing the cost and time.<br><br>
[0013] Yet another object of the invention is to provide a single common communication interface in the mother board to connect the child/daughter cards of different communication standards to execute the multiple communication protocols easily and to choose a required communication protocol easily without changing the base board corresponding to different; communication protocols.<br>
[0014] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

A child card of desired communication standard is chosen and inserted into the female connector. The child card is secured to the mother board by using a screw and fastener assembly.<br><br>
