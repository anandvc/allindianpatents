				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a shower head having a housing and a surface where<br>
jets exit the housing. The surface has numerous exit apertures. Various forms of<br>
shower heads of that type have long been known and inherently have numerous<br>
modes of operation.<br>
The problem addressed by the invention is creating a shower head of the<br>
aforementioned type having modes of operation that are unknown under the<br>
state of the art and, in particular, have beneficial uses.<br>
That problem is solved by a shower head having the features of the invention.<br>
Beneficial embodiments of the invention are covered by the description discussed<br>
in detail below.<br>
The shower head contains a housing whose end is closed off by a disk from<br>
which jets exit. This disk contains numerous apertures from which jets exit that<br>
may be specially configured by means of certain arrangements. In particular, the<br>
shower head contains a large, flat housing. The air intake may, for example, be<br>
configured such that it introduces air into the housing through the disk from<br>
which jets exit, for example, directly at the center of the, preferably planar, disk<br>
from which jets exit.<br>
In order to arrive at a particularly judicious distribution of the located water<br>
within the housing, and thus a particularly judicious distribution of the aerated<br>
jets outside the housing, according to the invention, under an elaboration<br>
thereon, the shower head may contain means for forming several, discrete jets<br>
inside the housing. These discrete water jets will thus be formed within the<br>
housing, rather than after.........................................................................................<br>
they exit the housing, which will allow undertaking certain procedures related to the<br>
water jets while they are still within the housing.<br>
In elaborating on the invention, the aerator may be configured such that it aerates<br>
water upstream from the means for forming jets, in which case, the means for<br>
forming jets will serve to form, from an aerated jet, discrete, aerated jets that may<br>
then be distributed within the shower head's housing, for example, over a surface<br>
having a diameter that is larger, for example, roughly ten to twenty times larger,<br>
than that of the water inlet.<br>
However, the means for forming jets and/or the aerator may also be, and it is<br>
preferred by the invention that it/they be, configured such that discrete jets that<br>
have previously been formed will be jointly and/or severally aerated, which will<br>
allow avoiding need for having to allow for their later aeration when forming the<br>
water jets.<br>
In further elaborating on the invention, the shower head may have guides in order<br>
to guide the aerated water jets to the exit apertures over the full extent of the jet<br>
disk, preferably in a uniform manner, or in a nonuniform manner, if desired.<br>
The guides may be arranged at various locations on, or within, the shower head,<br>
for example, in the distribution chamber, which is configured immediately upstream<br><br>
from the jet disk. However, the guides may also be arranged where the formed jets<br>
are aerated, or where the aerated jets are formed.<br>
For example, in elaborating thereon, the guides and/or the aerator may be<br>
configured such that they generate turbulence in the aerated jets, which, if it<br>
occurs, will, among other things, represent suitable means for extending jets' dwell<br>
times within the shower head's housing in order to therewith obtain longer and/or<br>
closer contact with the devices present in the shower head's housing.<br>
In elaborating on the invention, the aerator may be configured such that it<br>
generates an air stream that is incident on the water stream at a right angle<br>
thereto, where, as has been mentioned, the former may be incident on discrete<br>
water jets that have previously been formed.<br>
However, the aerator may also be, and the invention covers the case where the<br>
aerator is, configured such that it generates discrete air jets or air streams, each of<br>
which will then be separately incident on the water stream.<br>
In particular, it may be provided that every air jet is coordinated to a water jet on<br>
which it is incident. A full, or merely partial, segregation of air streams and water<br>
streams may be conducted within the housing, which will allow aerating the<br>
discrete water jets to differing degrees, or aerating them at a different location.<br>
In order to generate the discrete water jets, the means for forming jets may, for<br>
example, have a perforated disk that is arranged at a right angle to the water<br>
stream. Every perforation will then generate a water jet. As has been mentioned,<br>
these water jets may be either totally, or merely partially, isolated from one another<br>
in order that various, discrete, narrow streams will form within a shared, common<br>
volume of water.<br>
The aerator may have a central collar, or hub, through whose interior ambient air<br>
enters the interior of the housing. The base of the hub may, for example, have a<br>
smooth surface that, together with an associated mating surface, forms a flat,<br>
annular chamber that directs the air stream at the water. However, the base of the<br>
hub may be, and the invention covers the case where the base of the hub is, also<br>
configured such that it has radial air guides, for example, grooves, that lead to a<br>
segregation of the air stream.<br>
The ends of the radial air guides, for example, the grooves or channels, are aligned<br>
on the apertures in the perforated disk. That alignment may, for example, be such<br>
that the centerlines of the grooves are aligned on the centers of the apertures.<br>
However, it will also be feasible to provide a tangential alignment such that the<br>
centerlines of the grooves range from off-center with respect to, to tangential to.<br>
the apertures in the perforated disk.<br>
The air guides may be precisely radial or slightly inclined.<br>
The hub, on whose inner end air flows essentially radially along a plane orthogonal<br>
to its longitudinal axis, may also contain guides for the aerated jets on its lateral<br>
surface, which is cylindrical. These guides might be the grooves that are aligned on<br>
the apertures in the perforated disk. These guides serve to keep the aerated jets<br>
discrete within the shower head's housing, that is, to delay, or hinder, their<br>
recombination.<br>
The grooves may primarily follow the axial direction, but may also be slightly<br>
inclined, for example, resemble an extra-coarse thread.<br>
A deflection by a corresponding, conical surface formed on the lateral surface of<br>
the hub may take place at the base of the hub, that is, at that location where the<br>
water stream is to be diverted radially outward, and into the interior of the shower<br>
head's housing. That deflection may also take place gradually by, for example,<br>
providing that the hub's lateral surface blends into a curved surface terminating ir. a<br>
radial plane. That curved surface, gradual transition, or deflection may also be<br>
present, or take place, regardless of whether axial water guides are present.<br>
The deflectors may, if the application in mind demands, also have discrete<br>
channels that, if present, may be either straight and orthogonal to the hut's<br>
longitudinal axis, straight and inclined, or curved.<br>
Guides that may be aligned on the deflectors' deflection axes may be arranged<br>
within the shower head's housing, that is, upstream from the jet disk, which is<br>
intended to yield an even distribution of the aerated water jets over the entire<br>
surface of the jet disk. The guides may be situated on, for example, the housing's<br>
inner wall or on an insert that is present within the housing.<br>
In elaborating thereon, the shower head may, in addition to a housing, a surface<br>
from which jets exit that has exit apertures, and a segregation into at least two<br>
zones, have a selector. That selector is capable of switching the water intake<br>
between a first zone and a second zone. A water inlet that channels water into the<br>
shower head is also provided. An air intake is provided for the purpose of aerating<br>
water jets exiting the shower head. The air intake aerates water that enters the<br>
shower head, and does so at a location between the water inlet and the surface<br>
from which jets exit. The air intake is activatable and deactivatable, i.e., may be<br>
switched between its activated state and deactivated state. According to the<br>
invention, the selector and the air intake are intercoupled such that the air intake<br>
will be switched from the activated state to the deactivated state, or from the<br>
deactivated state to the activated state, when the selector is actuated. The air<br>
intake will thus change its activation state whenever it is switched from the first<br>
zone to the second zone. In other words, according to the invention, a dual function<br>
applies whenever the selector is actuated, which also makes it clear that the<br>
selector might operate the other way around, i.e., switch from one zone to the other<br>
whenever operation of the air intake is activated or deactivated.<br>
That approach yields a beneficial dual function. Actuating a single control triggers<br>
two operations. In particular, operation of the air intake may be activated or<br>
deactivated by choosing to combine the zones or making its operation contingent<br>
upon combining them.<br>
In elaborating on the invention, the first zone might be configured in the form of a<br>
section of the surface from which jets exit, where the former might, for example. Be<br>
a central section thereof. In this conjunction, the second zone might be the entire<br>
surface from which jets exit. For example, operation of the air intake might be<br>
activated whenever the selector is set to the second zone or to the entire surface<br>
from which jets exit, which has the advantage that the introduction of air, or the<br>
aeration of the water jets, will allow creating streams of water exiting the shower<br>
head that appear voluminous, which, in view of the greater number of exit<br>
apertures, will be of benefit if a large area is involved.<br>
The selector is beneficially manually actuatable. Either a knob, a slide, or similar<br>
may be depressed in order to actuate it. It will be beneficial if an entire and, in<br>
particular, large housing component, may be moved relative to another housing<br>
component or the remainder of the housing.<br>
Both zones, or all zones, may be connected to the water inlet via a distribution<br>
chamber that supplies them with water. The distribution chamber may beneficially<br>
cover the full areas of all zones or the full area of the upstream side of the surface<br>
from which jets exit, which will guarantee a good supply of water to all zones and<br>
all exit apertures on the surface from which jets exit. The selector may be<br>
configured such that it is arranged, and acts, in the distribution chamber. When set<br>
to the first zone, it might restrict the coverage of the distribution chamber to that<br>
area corresponding to the first zone. When set to another zone, or the second<br>
zone, the restriction of the coverage of the distribution chamber might be adjusted<br>
to suit the area of the other zone involved. When set to provide coverage of the<br>
entire surface from which jets exit, the restriction of the distribution chambers<br>
coverage might be eliminated in order that it will cover the full extent of the surface<br>
from which jets exit.<br>
The selector may have a cap that may particularly preferentially be configured such<br>
that it will be capable of restricting the coverage of the distribution chamber.<br>
Restricting the coverage of the distribution chamber may be readily accomplished<br>
by providing that the cap may abut against the upstream side of the surface from<br>
which jets exit. That system is preferably sealed. Restriction of the distribution<br>
chamber's coverage is preferably accomplished by employing a wall as cap. The<br>
area on that wall to be involved should preferably form that part of the distribution<br>
chamber that corresponds to the selected area on the surface from which jets exit.<br>
In order to improve the sealing of the system, a formed seal may be provided. For<br>
example, a lip seal will be suitable for that purpose. It may abut against a seat that<br>
faces upstream and merges into the restricted distribution chamber, in which case,<br>
rising water pressure will contribute to its sealing action.<br>
One opportunity for fabricating a surface from which jets exit is choosing an elastic<br>
material, for example, an elastomer, which might be a rubbery elastomer, for that<br>
purpose. A wall or a cap might be emplaceable on the upstream side of such a jet<br>
disk in order to effect a sealing action. An aforementioned, protruding seal may<br>
beneficially be formed onto the upstream side of the jet disk, which will obviate<br>
need for employing a separate seal.<br>
Water is beneficially inducted into the shower head centrally, in any event, in a<br>
vicinity that is situated a short distance upstream from the distribution chamber,<br>
which will allow achieving the most uniform distribution over the surface from which<br>
jets exit. A central aerator that inducts air into the shower head, or directs air onto<br>
the surface from which jets exit, will also be beneficial. Induction of water may<br>
beneficially be from the upstream side of the surface from which jets exit, or the top<br>
of the shower head. An aerator may transit a central aperture in the surface from<br>
which jets exit, i.e., protrude into the shower head's housing from that side thereof<br>
from which water exits.<br>
A channel for inducting air that may both transit the surface from which jets exit<br>
and even be joined thereto, or attached in the vicinity thereof, may be provided.<br>
The selector may also be connected to the water inlet, or attached thereto. In the<br>
case of one embodiment of the invention, the surface from which jets exit may be<br>
moved relative to the water inlet in order to switch and activate the shower head, in<br>
which case, a shutter on the water inlet may then be employed to shut or open the<br>
channel for inducting air and, for example, a wall on the selector, would<br>
simultaneously restrict the distribution chamber's coverage.<br>
Although, as has been mentioned, air may be inducted through that side of the<br>
shower head from which water exits, i.e., through the surface from which jets exit, it<br>
will be beneficial if air exits the aeration channel in a direction orthogonal to the<br>
water intake or water inlet. Air is inducted under exploitation of the Venturi effect,<br>
and a turbulent mixing of air in the water will occur. Air may also be distributed<br>
throughout the inducted water using that approach.<br>
In the case of one embodiment of the invention, the water intake may have<br>
numerous apertures that may be annularly distributed about a centerline, where<br>
the apertures may beneficially be elongated slots in order to, among other things,<br>
accelerate the discrete water jets. Air from the air intake may enter immediately<br>
upstream of the apertures due to, for example, the aforementioned Venturi effect,<br>
which will allow attaining a thorough mixing of air and water.<br>
Turbulence-generating devices situated upstream, referenced to the direction of<br>
water flow, from the location where air enters may also be provided. The mixture of<br>
water and entrained air will strike those turbulence-generating devices, which, for<br>
example, might be in the form of multistage cascades, and will become even more<br>
turbulent and admixed. Such turbulence-generating devices are beneficially<br>
distributed about a centerline of the shower head's housing, or about a channel for<br>
inducting air. For example, they might be formed on the outer walls of the channel,<br>
which will be particularly indicated if the channel for inducting air is tubular, in<br>
which case, it might be attached to the exit end of the shower head.<br>
In addition to their turbulence-generation function, the turbulence-generating<br>
devices may be configured for providing that inducted water will be distributed over<br>
the full extent of the upstream side of the surface from which jets exit enclosed<br>
within the distribution chamber, or deflecting and distributing inducted water. It //ill<br>
be beneficial if an approximately uniform distribution of the inducted water entering<br>
the distribution chamber occurs.<br>
The shower head proposed by the invention may, in particular, also find application<br>
as a side-mounting shower head. Due to the admixing with air, the water jets<br>
acquire a longer range, which, in the case of a vertically oriented surface from<br>
which jets exit, also has the benefit that the water jets will strike a standing body<br>
situated at a certain distance from the shower head over an extended area and at<br>
the desired height. Since air induction occurs through the surface from which jets<br>
exit from that side thereof from which water exits, configuring, arranging, and<br>
installing a side-mounting shower head from a coming generation of shower heads<br>
will be neither complicated nor more difficult than in the case of known side-<br>
mounting shower heads that lack air admixing.<br>
Those and other features of the invention will be evident from the claims, this<br>
description, and the figures, where the respective individual features involved may<br>
represent themselves alone or several such in the form of subcombinations thereof<br>
implemented in an embodiment of the invention and in other areas, and beneficial<br>
and inherently patentable versions, for which patent protection is herewith claimed.<br>

Detailed Description of the Sample Embodiment<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 depict a shower head 11 according to the invention. The shower<br>
head 11 consists of a housing shell 12 that rests on a base 13 or is guided onto the<br>
latter. The shower head 11 is connected to a water fitting 14 having a known ball-<br>
head configuration by means of a cap nut 15. The water fitting 14 resides on, for<br>
example, a ceiling.<br>
The housing shell 12 is essentially in the form of a tubular extension 17 that<br>
extends downward and blends into the broad extension 18. The base 13, which<br>
also broadens downward, forming an extension 24, is similarly configured.<br>
Rubber rings 20 are inserted into the upper section of the base 13. Protrusions 22<br>
also extend outward from the latter. The rubber rings 20 provide for a sealed joint<br>
with the tubular extension 17 of the housing shell 12. The tubular extension 17 also<br>
has inclined grooves 19 that resemble a thread. The protrusions 22 engage those<br>
grooves. The housing shell 12 thus glides relative to the base 13 when rotated, as<br>
will be clearly evident from a comparison of Figs. 1 and 2. Pressing, and thus<br>
gliding, of the housing shell 12 relative to the base 13 directly along the centerline<br>
in order to adjust it might also employ short grooves and protrusions, instead of<br>
such an embodiment resembling a thread.<br>
The extension 24 of the base 13 has a circumferential, annular ridge 25 extending<br>
downward from its outer rim. The latter's precise shape may be seen in Fig. 2. The<br>
annular ridge 25 merges into a narrow profile resembling a "V." In the position<br>
shown in Fig. 1, the latter provides a sealing action that will be described in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
The shower head 11 also has a front face 27 that is joined to the housing shell 12<br>
in the vicinity of its outer edge. The front face 27 carries the jet disk 29 on its rear<br>
face when the latter is inserted. The jet disk 29 is fabricated from an elastomer in a<br>
known manner and has molded-on nozzles for forming the exit apertures 30. From<br>
Fig. 1. and particularly from Fig. 2, it may be seen that the rear face 21 of the jet<br>
disk 29 is essentially planar. The circumferential lip 32 is the sole feature formed<br>
on the rear face 31, and may abut against the annular ridge 25, as will be evident<br>
from Fig. 1.<br>
A water inlet 33 extends through the water fitting 14 and into the shower head 11.<br>
Water exits the ball-head on the water fitting 14 through apertures 34 that are<br>
distributed around a centerline, and enters the upper section of the distribution<br>
chamber 36, which is situated within the tubular extension 17. As is evident from<br>
Fifl. 1. due to the sealing abutment of the extension 24 against the mating annular<br>
ridge 24 on the rear face 31 of the jet disk 29, water can reach only those exit<br>
apertures 30 that lie within that zone. No other water flow paths exist. In particular,<br>
the outer zone, i.e., Zone B, exclusive of Zone A, is blocked.<br>
If the housing shell 12, together with its extension 18, is translated downward<br>
relative to the base 13, then the extension 24, together with its annular ridge 25,<br>
will jolt away from the rear face 31 of the jet disk 29. The distribution chamber 36<br>
will be open all the way, and will then include the zone extending from the<br>
apertures 34 on the water inlet 33 to the full extent of the rear face of the jet disk<br>
29. Water will then be able to exit through all exit apertures 30 on the jet disk 29.<br>
Furthermore, how, in this case, the cap 42 is slid off the upper aperture in the air<br>
channel 38 will be evident from a comparison of Fig. 2 to Fig. 1. The air intake 40<br>
will thus be open, form the front face of the jet disk 29, or the front face 27 of the<br>
shower head 11, into the shower head, or into the distribution chamber 36. As may<br>
be seen, air exiting the upper aperture on the air channel 38 is incident on the<br>
water shooting downward through the apertures 34 and into the distribution<br>
chamber 36 at roughly a right angle thereto. Due to the Venturi effect, the entering<br>
water will entrain the air. A certain admixing of water and air will have already<br>
simultaneously commenced.<br>
That water-air mixture is incident on a turbulence-generating extension 46 that is<br>
formed on the lower section of the outer wall of the air channel 38. As may be seen<br>
from the chamfering of the turbulence-generating extension 46, water incident<br>
thereon from above will be deflected sideward, i.e., into the side-arm of the<br>
distribution chamber 36. Turbulence in, or admixing, of the water-air mixture will<br>
also occur. Further, similar extensions, or necks, might be added at this location.<br>
The turbulence-generating extension is preferably configured in the form of a<br>
multistage cascade. The envelope of the cascaded stages may match the<br>
chamfering.<br>
As may be seen from the figures, the profile of the extension 24 of the base 13<br>
matches the profile of the extension 18 of the housing shell 12. The step in the<br>
extension 18 provides space for the extension 24 to enter the step. It also restricts<br>
the coverage of the outer, annular section of the distribution chamber 36 such that<br>
the water supply to all exit apertures 30 will be approximately equal in the position<br>
shown in Fig. 2, i.e., when water is supplied to the full extent of the jet disk 29.<br>
As will be evident from Fig. 2, in addition to a more or less discontinuous switching<br>
between the first zone A and the second zone B, as well as between aerated and<br>
nonaerated, it will, under some circumstances, also be feasible to configure at least<br>
one of the functions such that it may be continuously controlled. In particular, the<br>
aerator may be employed for that purpose. The shapes of the lower section of the<br>
cap 42 and the associated aperture in the upper section of the air channel 38 might<br>
be configured such that the motion of the housing shell 12 relative to the base 13<br>
will yield a continuous opening of the air intake 40 via the air paths 44 over its full<br>
travel, where that opening may transpire more rapidly than will be the case when<br>
the distribution chamber 36 is opened.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts a shower head similar to the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2,<br>
except that it lacks a selector. An insertable plate 50 that has bores 51<br>
corresponding to the exit apertures 30 on the jet disk 29 is arranged upstream from<br>
the jet disk 29. The insertable plate is fabricated from a harder plastic than that<br>
employed in fabricating the jet disk 29. Among other things, the former's purpose is<br>
retaining the elastomer jet disk 29 on the 1ront face 27 thereof and on the base 52<br>
of the housing, which is intended to prevent the inclination angles of individual<br>
nozzles from changing during installation, or during operation.<br>
The insertable plate 50 has discrete ribs 53 on its upstream side that subdivide the<br>
space between the jet disk and the housing's rear wall 52. That subdivision is<br>
intended to guide and direct the individual, aerated jets within the housing.<br>
Further details, in particular, details related to the supply of air and water, shall be<br>
discussed below.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts another embodiment of a shower head that, in this case, is<br>
particularly simply configured. The shower head's housing contains a rear wall 52<br>
and a very simple jet disk 54, between which a rather flat, disk-shaped, distribution<br>
chamber 55 is formed. Sealing thereof takes place in the vicinity of its edge, and<br>
employs a seal present in a groove 56 on its rear wall 52 that abuts against the<br>
upstream side 56 of the jet disk 54 (cf. Fig. 6). In this case, the entire jet disk 54 is<br>
fabricated from a relatively hard plastic in order that the inclinations and shapes of<br>
the apertures 57, from which jets exit, will remain constant. As may be seen from<br>
Fig. 5, which depicts a view of the housing shown in Fig. 4, drawn on an enlarged<br>
scale, the apertures 57, from which jets exit, are inclined and conical.<br>
Since the fitting connecting the housing of the shower head shown in Figs. 3 and 4<br>
to the water line corresponds to that shown in Fig. 1, these details need no further<br>
explanation. In the case of the embodiment shown in Figs. 3 and 4, water entering<br>
through the inlet will now be incident on a perforated disk 60 orthogonal to the<br>
direction of water flow (cf. the enlarged-scale depiction appearing in Fig. 7). The<br>
perforated disk 60 is circular and planar, and has a circumferential ridge 61<br>
extending downstream. The diameter of the orifice 62 in the inlet is much smaller<br>
than that of the perforated disk 60. The circular apertures 63 arranged on the<br>
perforated disk 60 are arranged around its circumference. Water thus must first be<br>
deflected outward, away from the aperture 62, if it is to reach the apertures 63.<br>
The apertures 63 in the perforated disk 60 segregate incoming water into discrete<br>
water jets. The aeration hub 64, which is present in both the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 3 and the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, is arranged immediately downstream<br>
from the central section of the perforated disk 60. Fig, 7 depicts the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig.3 drawn on an enlarged scale. The upstream end of the aeration<br>
hub 64 is in the form of a planar terminal surface 65 situated a short distance on<br>
one or the other side of the perforated disk 60. Air inducted through the central<br>
aperture 40 in the aeration hub 64 is directed at the water jets, which have<br>
previously been segregated, in the form of a very narrow, flat stream. A Venturi<br>
effect that inducts the air stream at the intersections thereof arises due to the high<br>
flow rates of the water jets downstream from the apertures 63.<br>
The aerated jets then travel along the cylindrical lateral surface 66 of the aeration<br>
hub 64 to the base 67 of the hub, where the lateral surface thereof expands,<br>
forming a truncated cone having a half angle of, for example, about 45°. That<br>
conical extension 67 abuts against the insertable plate 50, on which water then<br>
flows radially outward along a plane. The angle of the deflecting surface 68 might<br>
fall within the range 10° - 80°. A gradually curved transition is also feasible. That<br>
deflecting device deflects the aerated water jets radially outward, and into the<br>
distribution chamber arranged upstream from the jet disk.<br>
Fig.8 depirtc a highly schematized top view of the perforated disk 60, which has<br>
eight apertures 63. In the case of an actual embodiment, the number of apertures<br>
63 will be greater than that in order to generate the greatest possible number of<br>
water jets. All of the apertures 63 lie on a circle near the perimeter of the perforated<br>
disk 60.<br>
Fig.9 depicts a side view of the aeration hub 64 shown in Fig. 7. It is clearly<br>
evident that the deflecting surface 68 extends all around the perimeter thereof. In<br>
the case of the embodiment depicted there, the lateral surface 66 thereof is<br>
smooth, as is its terminal surface 65.<br>
Figs. 10-12 depict an embodiment of an aeration hub 164 that is a modification of<br>
the aeration hub 64. Several radial channels 70 that extend from the interior 40 of<br>
the hub 164 to its lateral surface are configured on its terminal surface 165. Axial<br>
channels 71 that are formed by grooves are present on its lateral surface, at the<br>
same locations as the radial channels 70. Every radial channel 70 merges into an<br>
axial channel 71. Further channels 72 that extend the other channels 70, 71, and<br>
whose depth decreases toward the bottom end of the deflecting surface 68 (cf.<br>
Fig. 10), are formed on the deflecting surface 68. This approach will provide that<br>
discrete air jets that will then be incident on the water jets formed by the apertures<br>
63 at the locations where they are formed will originate on the terminal surface 165<br>
of the aeration hub 164.<br>
In the top view of Fig. 11, the channels 72 in the deflecting surface 68 are still<br>
straight and radially oriented. However, Figs. 13 and 14 depict the corresponding<br>
views in the case of another aeration hub, where the channels 172 in the deflecting<br>
surface 168 are arched, or curved, which will give the aerated jets an inclination<br>
that they will retain upon exiting the aeration hub. That approach will generate<br>
turbulence in the aerated jets within the distribution chamber of the shower head's<br>
housing.<br>
In the case of the embodiment shown in Fig,. 14. which depicts a deconvolution of a<br>
side view of an aerating hub, the channels 171 are inclined with respect to its<br>
longitudinal axis and resemble an extra-coarse thread, rather than straight and<br>
parallel to its longitudinal axis, as in the case of the embodiment shown in fig. 12.<br>
which will initiate generation of vortices in the aerated jets earlier.<br>
The aeration jet 164 shown in Fig. 10 may, for example, be arranged such that the<br>
lands between the channels 70 that lie in the plane of its terminal surface 165 will<br>
contact the underside of the perforated disk 60, which will then result in totally<br>
isolated air jets being generated. However, a certain spacing might also remain in<br>
order that a preferred flow field may be generated at the locations of the channels<br>
70.<br>
What has been said about the guides, based on the aeration hubs, may also be<br>
carried forward into the distribution chamber. For example, the apertures from<br>
which jets exit might be arranged in the form of straight extensions of projections of<br>
the channels 72, 172. However, not all channels 72/172 will need to have the same<br>
curvature or the same direction. It may be provided that aerated water jets that are<br>
to be deflected further outward, into the distribution chamber, exit the base of the<br>
aeration hub along straight paths, while those to be deflected to apertures from<br>
which jets exit that are closer in are given more turbulence.<br>
Due to the simplified representations employed, the embodiments shown in<br>
Figs. 3-14 exhibit no switching device for switching between various zones of the<br>
surface from which jets exit. They also exhibit no device for switching the aerator<br>
on and off. Nevertheless, the measures for generating and maintaining discrete,<br>
aerated jets involved are, of course, also possible, and sensible, in the case of<br>
shower heads that have such switching devices. The invention expressly proposes<br>
precisely that.<br>
