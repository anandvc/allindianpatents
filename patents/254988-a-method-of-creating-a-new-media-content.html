				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of Software Desktop application, Feature Phone (Mobile Phone), Smart phone &amp; handheld device. Further, this invention relates to a new use case for desktop, Mobile phone with video record facility &amp; hand held device for creating a new media content. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of creating new media content.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There are some desktop audio-video editing application available but none of them provides a facility to play original clip and record your own video at a time and mixing of media streams to create a new mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4). Therefore this is the only application that allows user to compare original video and live video in real time and also allows user to record same comparison in file. Some handheld devices are available for recording but complete functionality as explained above is not available in one device and the user needs to use multiple devices and tools to create such mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4) which consumes time, cost and also, multimedia knowledge to handle the tools is required.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Currently there is no such application available that allows user to perform recording and playback together in real time to form a new media content. In the <br><br><br><br>
current approach user needs to record video and then create a new media content by editing recorded video and original video either using desktop tools or video editor. But this being a non-real time technique it is not possible to create a media content similar to real time effect As the application works in real time, no further editing, processing is required as the new media content is available immediately after closing the application. Due to real time effect it is possible to compare live actions and original actions together and also it is possible to compare both by playing the recorded content in media player. It relieves user from using different devices and tools to generate such kind of media files, saves user time, money and gives real time comparison of original video and recorded video which is not available in any application or device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention discloses a new use case of creating a new media content in real time by allowing user to perform playback and recording at a time which enables him to view live video along with playback of recorded media file and also allows the user to create a new media content by mixing either original audio and live video or original audio and merged live and recorded video. Due to this application user can watch and compare original video and live video together in real time and also can record this session in a transportable media format which can be played or can be shared with other users.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of creating a new media content in real time comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	allowing a user to perform playback and recording at a time which enables viewing live video along with playback of recorded media file; and<br>
(b)	allowing the said user to create a new media content by mixing either original audio and live video or original audio and merged live and recorded video.<br>
The application provides following features to the user:<br>
a.	Allows user to play original audio-video mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4) and record live video at a time.<br>
b.	User can watch both original video and live video in Picture in Picture format on display screen to compare live video with original video.<br>
The Application provides following two options for recording or to create a new mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4):<br>
·	Option1-Original audio from input mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4) as well as live video are written in a new mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4). Please refer fig.1.<br>
·	Option2-lt performs frame by frame real time merging of two videos i.e. decoded   video frame from input file and live video frame from<br>
4<br><br>
camera as displayed in Picture in Picture format. Merged video frame is encoded and written to new mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4) along with original audio of input file. This is depicted in the figure 2.<br>
Ail above operations are performed in real time.<br>
The newly created file can be sent to other users using MMS or IMS file share application or can be played in a media player. Due to simultaneous playback of input media file and live video from Camera user can compare actions in two videos as they are displayed in picture in picture format As application allows an option of recording and creating mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4) during this process, the same comparison can be done when the file is played in media player. Thus user can compare recorded actions with original video at the time of executing application and also when recorded file is played in media player. As recorded file is being in mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4) can be shared with other users through MMS or IMS applications.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

·	Image processing algorithm to merge two YUV images for recording picture in picture view<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
·	Display device<br>
The figure 1 shows the major processing blocks required for option 1 to be selected by user. The media file reader block reads audio/ video stream of mobile phone media file (3gp/3g2/mp4) selected by user.<br>
The audio decoder block decodes the audio bit-stream supplied by media file reader block.<br>
The video decoder block decodes the video bit-stream supplied by media file reader block.<br>
The media file reader block &amp; audio/video decoder blocks are mainly responsible for playback of the input file selected by user.<br>
The decoded audio is played by speaker &amp; decoded video is displayed on display device. The decoded display forms one part of Picture in Picture format. Simultaneously Camera captures the live image &amp; displays captured live image on display device. This image forms the other part of picture in picture format. Thus display device shows two images in picture in picture format, one from camera &amp; another is original video provided by video decoder.<br>
The live image captured by camera is also provided to video encoder in addition to display device. The video encoder encodes live data provided by camera &amp; feeds to media file writer. The media file reader also feeds encoded audio bit-stream to media file writer. The audio bit-stream from media file reader &amp; video bit-stream from video encoder is synchronized &amp; written to a file by media file writer. The figure 2 shows the major processing blocks required for option 2 to be<br><br>
selected by user. The media file reader block is used to read audio &amp; video bit-stream of mobile phone media file (3gp/3g2/mp4) selected by user. The audio decoder block decodes the audio bit-stream supplied by media file reader block.<br>
The video decoder block decodes the video bit-stream supplied by media file reader block.<br>
The media file reader block &amp; audio/video decoder blocks are mainly responsible for playback of the input file selected by user.<br>
The decoded audio is played by speaker &amp; decoded video is displayed on display device. The decoded display forms one part of Picture in Picture format. Simultaneously Camera captures the live image &amp; displays captured live image on display device. This image forms the other part of picture in picture format. Thus display device shows two images in picture in picture format, one from camera &amp; another from input file provided by video decoder.<br>
The live image captured by camera is also provided to image processing block in addition to display device. The image processing block gets another image from video decoder. The two images provided to image processing block are basically two images displayed on display device. The image processing block merges two images into one image. The resultant image is one image as displayed in picture in picture format on display device. The video encoder encodes image provided by image processing block &amp; feeds to media file writer. The media file reader also feeds encoded audio bit-stream to media file writer. The audio bit-stream from media file reader &amp; video bit-stream from video encoder is synchronized &amp; written to a file by media file writer.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Operation Details<br>
·	User selects any audio-video or audio only mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4)<br>
·	User chooses one of the following option for recording<br>
·	Recording option 1- option of merging live and video data from input file to form one video and then writing merged encoded video data in a new file along with encoded audio of input file in mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4). This is basically recording of picture in picture format that user watches on Display device.<br>
·	Recording option 2-option of writing encoded live video data captured by camera and encoded audio from input media file in mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4)<br>
·	When application is launched it starts input output devices and major processing blocks like mobile phone media file reader, mobile phone media file writer, audio and video codecs and input/output devices like camera, sound output device, display device etc.<br>

The video data decoded by decoder is displayed in small window of Picture in Picture on Display screen and audio data decoded by audio decoder is played on speaker. The decoding is done by frame by frame. In other words application starts local playback of selected file in frame by frame mode.<br><br><br>
·	•	At the same time application also captures live video data from camera. Depending on the file recording option specified by user video data from camera is either merged with the decoded video data of input file and given to video encoder (to record picture in picture as seen on display for non real time comparison) or without merging camera output is directly given to video encoder<br>
·	•	Mobile phone media file format writer receives encoded video data from video encoder and encoded audio data from input file and writes to a new file in mobile phone media file format (3gp/3g2/mp4)<br>
·	Application displays two videos at a time on Display device in picture in picture format, one is live video from camera in big size and another is decoded video data of input file in small size. With this feature user can compare live video and original video. The bigger size live video frame and smaller size decoded video frame from input file is merged to a single video frame as displayed on LCD using image processing algorithm and then given to encoder and file writer for recording comparison.<br>
·	Application stops all devices and processing blocks when it detects an end of input mobile phone media file<br>
·	The newly recorded file is ready for playback when all devices and processing blocks are closed. When Recorded file is played it shows original audio and live recorded video or original audio and picture in picture comparison of original and live recorded video depending on the option chosen by user.<br><br><br>
