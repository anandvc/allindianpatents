				<td>Description<br>
[001] Process for making a PIPA-polyol<br>
[002] The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing PIPA polyols, such<br>
PIPA polyols and the use of such PIPA polyols in making polyurethanes. PIPA<br>
(polyisocyanate polyaddition) polyols have been disclosed before, see e.g. US<br>
4452923, US 4438252, US 4554306, GB 2102822, GB 2072204, WO 94/12553, US<br>
5292778 and EP 418039. PIPA polyols are polyaddition reaction products of a polyisocyanate<br>
and a low molecular weight compound having a plurality of hydroxyl,<br>
primary amine and/or secondary arnine groups in the presence of high molecular<br>
weight polyols, in particular polyether polyols. The PIPA polyol is a dispersion of<br>
particulate material in a polyol and is used e.g. in making slabstock or moulded<br>
flexible foams with improved load-bearing properties. The amount of PIPA polyol<br>
used in formulations for making such foams conventionally is -such that the amount of<br>
particulate material calculated on all high molecular weight polyol used in the<br>
formulation is 1-15% by weight. The most commonly used PEPA polyol nowadays<br>
probably is a PIPA polyol having about 20% by weight of particulate material, which<br>
is diluted with further high molecular polyol to the above 1-15% by weight loading<br>
range.<br>
[003] It is also desirable to be able to provide PIPA polyol with a considerably higher<br>
loading. It would allow the foam producer to use PIPA polyol with higher loadings for<br>
making the foam. Even if the foam producer would dilute the PIPA polyol with a<br>
higher loading, it would have the advantage that the PEPA polyol can be transported in<br>
a more concentrated form and is diluted at the place where it is needed and to the<br>
extent needed. Further it provides the polyurethane systems' formulator with less<br>
formulation restrictions. The foams made from such PEPA polyols show good fire<br>
retardancy properties and are easily recyclable. Processes for making such PEPA<br>
polyols, with a higher loading, are known, see e.g. the prior art mentioned before.<br>
However these processes lead to products which have a high viscosity and/or are not<br>
stable or these processes lead, certainly at a larger scale, to an uncontrollable reaction<br>
which gives PIPA polyols which could cause foam collapse when used in making<br>
flexible polyurethane foams. In WO 00/73364 a process is described for preparing a<br>
PIPA-polyol having a loading of 30-80% by weight and a relatively low viscosity.<br>
When used in making flexible foams such PIPA polyols give a cell opening effect<br>
which often is too strong and a reinforcing effect which is too low; further the<br>
compression set and the fire performance of the foam would need improvement.<br>
[004] Surprisingly a novel PEPA-polyol has been found which shows good stability and a<br>
relatively low viscosity, also at higher loadings. Further, foams made from such PEPApolyols<br>
show improved load-bearing characteristics at comparable densities. Still<br>
farther, when making moulded foams using such PIPA-polyols good mouldings were<br>
obtained while mouldings made from traditional PIPA-polyols showed internal defects.<br>
[005] Therefore, the present invention is concerned with a polyol composition,<br>
comprising participate material in dispersed form in a polyol having an average<br>
equivalent weight of 500 or more and in an amount of 1-80% by weight calculated on<br>
the total polyol composition, this composition having a viscosity of 1500-25000 mPa.s<br>
at 25°C and the particulate material comprising reaction products of a polyol having an<br>
average equivalent weight of up to 400 and of diphenylmethane diisocyanate<br>
optionally comprising homologues thereof having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or<br>
more and/or modified variants of such polyisocyanates, wherein the polyol having an<br>
equivalent weight of 500 or more is a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyol<br>
having an oxyethylene content of 15-49% and preferably of 21-45% by weight<br>
calculated on the total oxyalkylene groups present wherein 20-80% of the oxyethylene<br>
groups resides at the end of the polymer chains.<br>
[006] The viscosity is measured using a Brookfield Viscometer, model DV-II with a<br>
spindle CP-41.<br>
[0071 Further the polyol composition according to the present invention preferably<br>
comprises particulate material of which at least 90% by volume has a particle size of<br>
10 urn or less as measured using a Mastersizer 2000, from Malvem Instruments,<br>
equipped with a Hydro 2000/s dispersion accessory, using methanol as eluent. The<br>
content of particulate material is the sum of the amount of polyisocyanate and the<br>
amount of polyol having an equivalent weight of up to 400 used in making the polyol<br>
composition according to the present invention and is calculated by the following<br>
formula: [coded mathematical formula included]<br>
[008] It will be clear mat in this calculation it is assumed that all reacted product gives<br>
particulate material and that no polyisocyanate reacts with the other polyol(s).<br>
Preferably at least 95% by volume and most preferably at least 99% by volume of the<br>
particles has a particle size of 10 um or less.<br>
[009] The polyol compositions according to the present invention are made by a process<br>
wherein the polyol having an average equivalent weight of up to 400 and the polyisocyanate<br>
are allowed to react in the polyol having an average equivalent weight of<br>
500 or more, wherein the number of NCO-groups in the polyisocyanate is 30-100%<br>
and preferably 40-80% of the number of OH-groups in the polyol having an equivalent<br>
weight of up to 400.<br>
[010] Further we have found a process for preparing a polyol composition comprising a<br>
particulate material, the amount of particulate material being 1 - 80% by weight<br>
calculated on the total composition wherein diphenylmethane diisocyanate, optionally<br>
comprising homologues thereof having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more and<br>
modified variants of such polyisocyanates, a polyol having an average equivalent<br>
weight of up to 400 and water are allowed to react in a polyol having an average<br>
equivalent weight of 500 or more, wherein the polyol having an equivalent weight of<br>
500 or more is a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyol having an oxyethylene<br>
content of 15-49% by weight and preferably of 21-45% by weight calculated on the<br>
total oxyalkylene groups present wherein 20-80% of the oxyethylene groups resides at<br>
the end of the polymer chains.<br>
[0111 In this process a small amount of water (0.1-5% by weight calculated on the amount<br>
of polyol composition) may be used.<br>
[012] The use of a small amount of water reduces the viscosity of the final polyol<br>
composition at comparable equivalent ratios of NCO-groups from the polyisocyanate<br>
and of OH-groups in the polyol having an average equivalent weight of up to 400.<br>
[013] Still further the present invention is concerned with a blend of 1-99 parts by weight<br>
(pbw) and preferably of 5-95 pbw of a polyol composition according to the present<br>
invention and 1-99 and preferably 5-95 pbw of another poyether polyol having an<br>
average equivalent weight of 500 or more (than the one used to make the composition).<br>
Other polyether polyols include those having an other oxyethylene content and / or distribution.<br>
[014] In the context of the present application the following terms have the following<br>
meaning :<br>
1. The expression "polyurethane foam" as used herein generally refers to cellular<br>
products as obtained by reacting polyisoycanates with isocyanate-reactive<br>
hydrogen containing compounds, using foaming agents, and in particular<br>
includes cellular products obtained with water as reactive foaming agent<br>
(involving a reaction of water with isocyanate groups yielding urea linkages<br>
and carbon dioxide and producing polyurea-urethane foams).<br>
2. The term "average nominal hydroxyl functionality" is used herein to indicate<br>
the number average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per molecule)<br>
of the polyol composition on the assumption that this is the number average<br>
functionality (number of active hydrogen atoms per molecule) of the<br>
initiator(s) used in their preparations although in practice it will often be<br>
somewhat less because of some terminal unsaturation. The term "equivalent<br>
weight" refers to the molecular weight per isocyanate reactive hydrogen atom<br>
in the molecule.<br>
3. The word "average" refers to number average unless indicated otherwise.<br>
[015] The polyol having an average equivalent weight of 500 or more preferably has an<br>
average equivalent weight of 1000-5000 and an average nominal hydroxy functionality<br>
of 2-6 (hereinafter referred to as compound 1). More preferably these polyols have an<br>
average equivalent weight of 1000-3000 and an average nominal hydroxy functionality<br>
of 2-4.<br>
[016] Compound 1 is selected from polyols obtained by the polymerization of ethylene<br>
oxide and propylene oxide in the presence of polyfuctional initiators. Suitable initiator<br>
compounds contain a plurality of active hydrogen atoms and include water, butanediol,<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, dipropylene<br>
glycol, ethanolamine, diethanolarnine, triethanolamine, toluene diamine, diethyl<br>
toluene diamine, phenyl diamine, diphenylmethane diamine, ethylene diamine, cyclohexane<br>
diamine, cyclohexane dimethanol, resorcinol, bisphenol A, glycerol,<br>
triraethylolpropane, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol and sucrose. Mixtures<br>
of initiators may be used as well.<br>
[017] The following way of describing polyols is used in the present application: A POEO<br>
polyol is a polyol having first a PO block attached to the initiator followed by an<br>
EO block. A PO-PO/EO polyol is a polyol having first a PO block and men a block of<br>
randomly distributed PO and EO. A PO-PO/EO-EO polyol is a polyol having first a<br>
PO block and then a block of randomly distributed PO and EO and then a block of EO.<br>
In the above descriptions only one tail of a polyol is described (seen from the initiator);<br>
the nominal hydroxy functionality will determine how many of such tails will be<br>
present.<br>
[018] Compound 1 preferably has a structure of the type PO-PO/EO-EO or of the type<br>
PO/EO-EO. The total EO content is from 15 to 49 and preferably from 21 to 45% by<br>
weight (over the weight of the total oxyalkylene units present). Compound 1 has a<br>
primary OH content of at least 50%, preferably at least 70% based on the primary and<br>
secondary hydroxyl groups in the polyol. In the PO-PO/EO-EO type polyol, the first<br>
PO block comprises preferably from 20 to 90% by weight of the PO units. The polyol<br>
having a structure of the type PO-PO/EO-EO can notably be produced according to the<br>
teaching of US 5594097. The polyol having a structure of the type -PO/EO-EO can<br>
notably be produced according to the teaching of US4559366. Most preferred structure<br>
is of the type PO-PO/EO-EO.<br>
[019] Mixtures of polyether polyols may be used as compound 1, provided the mixture<br>
has the characteristics described above for compound 1.<br>
[020] The polyol having an equivalent weight of up to 400 (hereinafter referred to as<br>
'compound 2') preferably has an equivalent weight of up to 200 and may be selected<br>
from alkanolamines, low equivalent weight amine-initiated polyether polyols and low<br>
equivalent weight hydroxyl-terminated compounds such as ethylene glycol, glycerine,<br>
glycol ethers, pentaerythritol or mixtures thereof.<br>
[021] Suitable alkanolamines are di- and trialkanolamines, particularly those wherein the<br>
alkanol groups each have from 2 to 6, preferably 2 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
[022] The most preferred compound is triethanolamine.<br>
[023] The polyisocyanate used in making the PIP A polyol may be selected from<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanates (MDI) optionally comprising homologues thereof<br>
having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more (such diisocyanate comprising such<br>
homologues are known as crude MDI or polymeric MDI or mixtures of such crude or<br>
polymeric MDI with MDI) and modified variants of such diphenylmethane diisocyanates<br>
optionally comprising such homologues.<br>
[024] The diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) used may be selected from 4,4'-MDI,<br>
2,4'-MDI, isomeric mixtures of 4,4'-MDI and 2,4'-MDI and less than 10% by weight<br>
of 2,2'-MDI, and modified variants thereof containing carbodiimide, uretonimine, isocyanurate,<br>
urethane, allophanate, urea and/or biuret groups. Preferred are 4,4'-MDI,<br>
isomeric mixtures of 4,4'-MDI and 2,4'-MDI and less than 10% by weight of 2,2'MDI<br>
and uretonimine and/or carbodiimide modified MDI having an NCO content of at least<br>
20% by weight and preferably at least 25% by weight and urethane modified MDI<br>
obtained by reacting excess MDI and polyol having a molecular weight of at most<br>
1000 and having an NCO content of at least 20% by weight and preferably at least<br>
25% by weight.<br>
[025] Diphenylmethane diisocyanate comprising homologues having an isoycanate functionality<br>
of 3 or more are so-called polymeric or crude MDI.<br>
[026] Polymeric or crude MDI are well known in the art. They are made by the<br>
phosgenation of a mixture of polyamines obtained by the acid condensation of aniline<br>
and formaldehyde.<br>
[027] The manufacture of both the polyamine mixtures and the polyisocyanate mixtures is<br>
well known. The condensation of aniline with formaldehyde in the presence of strong<br>
acids such as hydrochloric acid gives a reaction product containing diaminodiphenylmethane<br>
together with polymethylene polyphenylene polyamines of higher<br>
functionality, the precise composition depending in known manner inter alia on the<br>
aniline/formaldehyde ratio. The polyisocyanates are made by phosgenation of the<br>
polyamine mixtures and the various proportions of diamines, triamines and higher<br>
polyamines give rise to related proportions of diisocyanates, triisocyanates and higher<br>
polyisocyanates. The relative proportions of diisocyanate, triisocyanate and higher<br>
polyisoycanates in such crude or polymeric MDI compositions determine the average<br>
functionality of the compositions, that is the average number of isocyanate groups per<br>
molecule. By varying the proportions of starting materials, the average functionality of<br>
the polysiocyanate compositions can be varied from little more than 2 to 3 or even<br>
higher. In practice, however, the average isocyanate functionality preferably ranges<br>
from 2.3-2.8. The NCO value of these polymeric or crude MDI is at least 30% by<br>
weight The polymeric or crude MDI contain diphenylmethane diisocyanate, the<br>
remainder being polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates of functionality greater<br>
than two together with by-products formed in the manufacture of such polyisocyanates<br>
by phosgenation of polyamines. Further modified variants of such crude or polymeric<br>
MDI may be used as well comprising carbodiimide, uretonimine, isocyanurate,<br>
urethane, allophanate, urea and/or biuret groups; especially the aforementioned<br>
uretonimine and/or carbodiimide modified ones and the urethane modified ones are<br>
preferred. Mixtures of polyisocyanates may be used as well.<br>
[028] The polyol compositions according to the present invention are prepared by<br>
allowing the polyisocyanate and compound 2 to react in compound 1. The order of<br>
addition may be varied but preferably compound 2 is added first to compound 1<br>
followed by the polyisocyanate. The amount of polyisocyanate used is such that the<br>
number of isocyanate groups CNCO-groups) is 30-100% and preferably 40-80% of the<br>
hydroxy groups (OH-groups) in compound 2. The amount of polyisocyanate and<br>
compound 2 together reflects the desired amount of particulate material in compound<br>
1: if one wishes to prepare a polyol with 25% by weight of particulate material then the<br>
amount of polyisocyanate and compound 2 together is 25% by weight of the total<br>
composition (compound 1 + compound 2 + polyisocyanate). The amount of particulate<br>
material preferably is 5-60% by weight.<br>
[029] The ingredients, once combined, are allowed to react. The combination of the ingredients<br>
may be conducted at ambient or elevated temperature by mixing. Since the<br>
reaction is exothermic no further heating is needed once the reaction starts; often<br>
cooling is desirable, particularly at the end of the reaction.<br>
[030] A preferred process is a process wherein:<br>
- compound 2 is emulsified in compound 1 at a temperature of 40-100°C under<br>
high shear mixing conditions,<br>
- a polyisocyanate is added gradually to the emulsion so formed while<br>
maintaining the temperature between 60-150°C and while maintaining high<br>
shear conditions,<br>
the reacting mixture, obtained after all polyisocyanate has been added, is<br>
allowed to react further for a period of time of 10 minutes - 2 hours while<br>
maintaining the temperature between 60-130°C,<br>
- the high shear mixing is discontinued, and optionally<br>
- the polyol so obtained is cooled to ambient temperature.<br>
[0311 In order to reduce the viscosity of a PIPA polyol composition according to the<br>
present invention, it is preferred to use a small amount of water in the preparation of<br>
such polyol composition.<br>
[032] Generally the amount is 0.1-5% by weight calculated on the total amount of the<br>
polyol composition and preferably 0.1-2% by weight calculated on the same basis. The<br>
water may be added at any stage but preferably it is added to compound 2 or the<br>
mixture of compound 1 and 2. So in one aspect of the present invention 0.1-5% by<br>
weight of water is used when preparing the polyol composition according to the<br>
present invention using an MDI polyisocyanate in an amount such that the number of<br>
NCO-groups is 30-100% and preferably 40-80% of the number of OH-groups in<br>
compound 2. In another aspect a polyol composition is prepared, the composition<br>
comprising pardculate material in dispersed form in a polyol having an average<br>
equivalent weight of 500 or more and the amount of particulate material being 1 -80%<br>
by weight calculated on the total polyol composition, the composition having a<br>
viscosity of 1500-25000 mPa.s at 25°C, by reacting in the above polyol, a polyol<br>
having an average equivalent weight of up to 400, a diphenylmethane diisocyanate<br>
optionally comprising homologues thereof having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or<br>
more and/or modified variants of such polyisocyanates, and water in an amount of<br>
0.1-5% by weight calculated on the total polyol composition, and wherein the polyol<br>
having an equivalent weight of 500 or more is a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene<br>
polyol having an oxyethylene content of 15-49% by weight and preferably of 21-45%<br>
by weight calculated on the total oxyalkylene groups present wherein 20-80% of the<br>
oxyethylene groups resides at the end of the polymer chains. The aforementioned<br>
preferences also apply to this process.<br>
[033] The PLPA-polyols according to the present invention are useful for making flexible<br>
polyurethane foams including reacting a polyisocyanate and a polyol composition<br>
according to the present invention or a blend according to the present invention in the<br>
presence of a blowing agent.<br>
[034] In particular slabstock flexible polyurethane foams and moulded flexible<br>
polyurethane foams can be made from such PIPA-polyols. The polyols are particularly<br>
useful hi making so called foam in fabric or pour in place mouldings since the amount<br>
of "strike-through" is reduced.<br>
[035] Examples<br>
[036] A PIPA-polyol 1 was made using Daltocel F428 ex Huntsman Polyurethanes as<br>
carrier polyol, triethanolamine (TELA, 99% pure) and Suprasec 2020 ex Huntsman<br>
Polyurethanes. Daltocel F 428 is an PO-EO polyol having a nominal functionality of 3,<br>
an EO-tip content of about 15% by weight and an OH value of 28 mg KOH/g.<br>
[037] Suprasec 2020 is a uretonimine - modified polyisocyanate having a NCO-value of<br>
29.5% by weight. Daltocel and Suprasec are trademarks of Huntsman International<br>
LLC. PIPA-polyol 1 was made according to WO 00/73364 at a solids content of 48%<br>
by weight.<br>
[038] PIPA-polyol 2 was made as follows: 30 kg of polyol 2 was blended with 6.92 kg of<br>
[039]<br>
[040]<br>
TELA for 30 minutes under high shear mixing. Then 13.08 kg of Suprasec 2020 was<br>
added gradually over 60 minutes while keeping the temperature at 120°C under high<br>
shear mixing. After completion of the polyisocyanate addition, stirring of the<br>
dispersion is continued for another 60 minutes while cooling the mixture to 90°C.<br>
Then mixing was stopped and the dispersion was allowed to cool down to ambient<br>
temperature. The PIPA-polyol 2 obtained had a viscosity of 8800 mPa.s at 25°C, a<br>
solids content of 40% by weight and all particles had a size below 10 um (viscosity,<br>
solids content and particle size were determined as described hereinbefore). Polyol 2 is<br>
a glycerol-initiated polyol of the type PO-PO/EO-EO with a distribution (in %w) of<br>
55-16/14 - 15 and an OH value of 28 mg KOH/g.<br>
The above made PIPA-polyols 1 and 2 were used to make flexible polyurethane<br>
foams (free rise and mouldings) from the following ingredients (amounts are in parts<br>
by weight, pbw); see Table 1. All ingredients, except the polyisocyanates, were<br>
premixed with each other before they were contacted with the polyisocyanate. The<br>
physical properties of the foams are given in Table 2.<br>
Polyol A: a glycerol-based polyoxyethylene polyol having a nominal functionality<br>
of 3 and an OH value of 127mg KOH/g.<br>
Polyisocyanate 1: Suprasec 2591, a polyisocyanate obtainable from Huntsman<br>
Polyurethanes.<br>
Polyisocyanate 2: A 91/4.5/4.5 w/w/w blend of prepolymer A/Suprasec<br>
2020/Suprasec 2185 wherein prepolymer A is the reaction product of 30 parts by<br>
weight of 4,4'- MDI and 70 parts by weight of Daltocel F442, ex Huntsman<br>
Polyurethanes.<br>
PIPA-polyol 3 was made as follows: 2.4kg of polyol 3 was blended with 0.5541cg of<br>
TELA for 15 minutes under high shear mixing. Then 1.046kg of Suprasec 2020 was<br>
added gradually over 60 minutes while keeping the temperature at 120°C under high<br>
shear conditions. After completion of the isocyanate addition, stirring of the dispersion<br>
is continued for another 60 minutes while cooling the mixture to 90°C. Then the<br>
mixing was stopped and the dispersion was allowed to cool down to ambient<br>
temperature. The PIPA-polyol 3 had a viscosity of 7100 mPa.s at 25°C, a solids content<br>
of 40% by weight and all particles had a size below 10 microns (all determined as<br>
before). Polyol 3 is aglycerol initiated polyol of the type PO-PO/EO-EO with a distribution<br>
(in %w) of 55-23/7-15 and an OH value of 30 mg KOH/g.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
