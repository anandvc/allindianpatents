				<td>An apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving data having a smallest PAPR in an SLM scheme for PAPR reduction in an OFDM communication system using multiple carriers. To transmit the data having the smallest PAPR, input symbol sequences are duplicated to a plurality of data blocks. Phase-rotated data blocks are generated by multiplying the plurality of data blocks by different phase sequences. Side information for identifying the phase-rotated data blocks is inserted into a predetermined t position of the phase-rotated data blocks.

				<td>The invention relates to the technical field of<br>
cryptography, and more precisely to what is called<br>
public key cryptography. In this type of cryptography,<br>
a user owns a pair of keys for a given use. Said pair<br>
of keys consists of a private key that this user keeps<br>
secret and an associated public key that this user may<br>
communicate to other users. For example, in the case of<br>
a pair of keys dedicated to confidentiality, the public<br>
key is then used to encipher the data, whereas the<br>
secret key is used to decipher it, that is to say to<br>
re-establish this data in clear.<br>
Public key cryptography is very widely used insofar as,<br>
unlike secret key cryptography, it does not require the<br>
interlocutors to share the same secret in order to<br>
establish a security-protected communication. However,<br>
this advantage in terms of security is accompanied by a<br>
disadvantage in terms of performance, since public key<br>
cryptography methods, also called "public key schemes",<br>
are often one hundred or one thousand times slower than<br>
secret key cryptography methods, also called "secret<br>
key schemes". A very great challenge is therefore to<br>
find public key cryptography methods that can be<br>
rapidly executed so as to be able to use them in<br>
resource-limited environments, such as standard<br>
microprocessor cards, with or without contacts.<br>
Most public key schemes existing at the present time<br>
rely on the difficulty of mathematical problems in the<br>
field of arithmetic (or "number theory"). Thus, the<br>
security of the RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) numerical<br>
signature and encryption scheme is based on the<br>
difficulty of the problem of factorizing integers:<br><br>
given a very large integer (having more than 500<br>
digits) obtained privately by multiplying together two<br>
or more prime numbers of comparable size, no effective<br>
method exists at the present time for recovering these<br>
prime numbers.<br>
Other public key schemes, such as the digital signature<br>
scheme described in patent application FR-A-2 716 058,<br>
rely for their security on the difficulty of what is<br>
called the "discrete logarithm problem". This problem<br>
may be expressed in its most general case as follows:<br>
let E be a set provided with an operation (i.e. with a<br>
function which, having two elements a and b, associates<br>
an element denoted "a.b" or "ab", and called the<br>
"product of a and b"), let g be an element of E, let r<br>
be a large integer and let y be the integer defined by:<br>
y = gr (that is to say the product g.g. .... .g, with g<br>
occurring r times); it is then unfeasible to recover r<br>
from g and y. Often the set E used is the set of<br>
integers modulo n, where n is an integer, a prime<br>
number or a number composed of prime numbers.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to the<br>
technical field of entity authentication, also called<br>
"identification", and also that of the authentication<br>
of a message and of its digital signature by means of<br>
public key cryptographic techniques. In such methods,<br>
the authenticated entity, called the "prover",<br>
possesses a secret or private key and an associated<br>
public key. The prover uses the secret key to produce<br>
an authentication value or a digital signature. The<br>
authenticating entity, called the "verifier", needs<br>
only the public key of the prover to verify the<br>
authentication value or the digital signature.<br>
The field of the invention is more particularly still<br>
that of the so-called "zero-knowledge" authentication<br>
methods. This means that the authentication takes place<br>
using a protocol which, in a proven manner, reveals<br><br>
nothing about the secret key of the authenticated<br>
entity, irrespective of the number of times it is used.<br>
From this type of scheme it is known how to deduce,<br>
using standard techniques, schemes for authenticating a<br>
message and a digital signature of this message.<br>
The field of the invention is more particularly still<br>
that of methods whose security relies both on the<br>
difficulty of the problem of factorizing integers and<br>
on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.<br>
The invention is applicable in any system using public<br>
key cryptography to protect the security of their<br>
elements and/or their transactions, and more<br>
particularly in systems in which the number of<br>
calculations performed by the various parties<br>
constitutes, at least for one of them, a critical<br>
parameter, either because it does not have available a<br>
coprocessor specialized in cryptographic calculations,<br>
often called a "cryptoprocessor", so as to speed up the<br>
calculations, or because it is capable of carrying out<br>
a large number of calculations simultaneously, for<br>
example in the case of central server, or for any other<br>
reason.<br>
A typical application is electronic payment, by bank<br>
card or by electronic purse. In the case of proximity<br>
payment, the payment terminal is in a public place,<br>
prompting the use of public key cryptography methods,<br>
so as not to store a master key. To reduce the overall<br>
costs of such a system, it may be desirable either for<br>
the card to be a standard microprocessor card, that is<br>
to say a card not provided with a cryptoprocessor, or<br>
for the security-protected microprocessor contained in<br>
the terminal itself to be of standard type, or for both<br>
of these. Depending on the case and on the<br>
cryptographic method adopted, the prior art known at<br>
the present time does achieve one or other of these<br>
objectives, but does not allow both to be easily<br><br>
achieved simultaneously, while complying with the<br>
constraints of the system. An example of such a<br>
constraint is that the payment shall be effected in<br>
less than one second, or even in less than 150<br>
milliseconds in the case of a contactless transaction,<br>
or even in a few milliseconds in the case of a freeway<br>
toll.<br>
The cryptographic method most widely used at the<br>
present time is the RSA method. It is based on the<br>
problem of factorization. This algorithm, standardized<br>
in various instances, has become a de facto standard.<br>
It will remain the predominant algorithm in years to<br>
come. Many products, systems and infrastructures, such<br>
as PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) infrastructures,<br>
have been designed from this algorithm and from the<br>
formats of the keys that it uses.<br>
As is known., according to this algorithm the public key<br>
consists of a pair of integers (n,e) and the private<br>
key consists of an integer d. The modulus n is an<br>
integer large enough for it to be unfeasible to<br>
factorize it. An entity A which, alone, holds the<br>
private key d, is the sole entity capable of generating<br>
an integer W equal to a power of the integer W modulo<br>
n with d as exponent, so as to allow any entity B<br>
knowing the public key (n,e) to recover the integer W<br>
by raising the integer W" to a power modulo n with e as<br>
exponent.<br>
In a method using a message signature M, the integer W<br>
is generally an image of the message via a function<br>
such as a known hash function. The prover is the entity<br>
A, the signature is the integer W", the verifier is the<br>
entity B which verifies that the integer found, based<br>
on the signature W", is the image of the message via<br>
the known function.<br>
In a method of identification, the integer W generally<br><br>
constitutes a challenge sent by the entity B, which is<br>
the verifier. The number W generated by the entity A,<br>
which is the prover, constitutes the response to this<br>
challenge.<br>
In a method of authenticating the message M, the<br>
integer W generally results from a combination of an<br>
image of the message M and of a challenge sent by the<br>
verifier consisting of the entity B. The number W<br>
generated by the entity A, which is the prover,<br>
constitutes an authentic signature in response to this<br>
challenge.<br>
However, the RSA algorithm has a problem stemming from<br>
the large number of operations to be carried out by the<br>
prover or the signer. To carry out a complete<br>
calculation in less than one second on a microprocessor<br>
card performing these operations, it is necessary to<br>
add a crypt oprocessor to the card. However, the<br>
fabrication and installation of a cryptoprocessor have<br>
a not inconsiderable cost, which increases the cost of<br>
the microprocessor card. It is also known that a<br>
cryptoprocessor consumes a large amount of current.<br>
Supplying the card via the terminal may pose technical<br>
difficulties in the case of a contactless interface. It<br>
is also known that the addition of a cryptoprocessor<br>
facilitates physical attack by spectral analysis of the<br>
current consumed, which presents a drawback to which it<br>
is difficult to find technical solutions. Moreover,<br>
even if the card is provided with a cryptoprocessor,<br>
the calculation may still prove too slow in<br>
applications in which the transaction time needs to be<br>
very short, as in certain of the examples mentioned<br>
above.<br>
The object of the present invention is to specify<br>
public key cryptographic methods such as authentication<br>
and digital signature methods. More precisely, the<br>
object of the present invention is to use the same keys<br><br>
as the RSA algorithm with a level of security at least<br>
equal to that of this algorithm, while still allowing a<br>
large majority of the calculations to be carried out in<br>
advance, which avoids having to use a cryptoprocessor.<br>
Considering a cryptographic method that can be used in<br>
a transaction for which a first entity generates, by<br>
means of an RSA private key, a proof verifiable by a<br>
second entity by means of an RSA public key associated<br>
with said private key, said public key comprising a<br>
first exponent and a modulus, the method according to<br>
the invention is noteworthy in that:<br>
the first entity generates a first element of<br>
proof, a first calculation of which, consuming<br>
considerable resources, can be executed independently<br>
of the transaction;<br>
the first entity generates a second element of<br>
proof related to the first element of proof and<br>
dependent on a common number shared by the first and<br>
second entities specifically for the transaction, a<br>
second calculation of which consumes few resources; and<br>
the second entity verifies that the first<br>
element of proof is related through a relationship with<br>
a first power modulo the modulus of a generic number<br>
having a second exponent equal to a linear combination<br>
of all or part of the common number and of the public<br>
key first exponent multiplied by the second element of<br>
proof.<br>
The fact that the keys are of the RSA type has the<br>
advantage of being able to use, without any<br>
modification, many existing products, developments or<br>
infrastructures, such as key production software,<br>
descriptions of microprocessor memory regions, public<br>
key certificate formats, etc.<br>
Since the first element of proof can be calculated<br>
completely or partly independently of the transaction,<br>
the first entity has the possibility of carrying out a<br><br>
complex calculation prior to the transaction, while<br>
keeping the execution of this complex calculation<br>
secret in order to guarantee security. Thus, it may be<br>
seen that a first entity rapidly generates such a first<br>
element of proof right from the start of the<br>
transaction without requiring powerful resources, such<br>
as those of a cryptoprocessor. Only the first entity is<br>
then capable of generating the second element of proof<br>
by relating it to the first element of proof so as to<br>
make, through simple operations, the second element of<br>
proof depend on a common number specifically shared by<br>
the transaction. The possible execution of these simple<br>
operations in a short time by the first entity avoids<br>
slowing down the transaction, while still maintaining a<br>
high level of security.<br>
Without being limited, the object of the transaction<br>
may be to identify the first entity, to sign a message<br>
or to authenticate a message.<br>
In particular, to allow the first entity to be<br>
identified:<br>
the first element of proof is generated by the<br>
first entity by raising the generic number to a second<br>
power modulo the modulus having a third exponent equal<br>
to the public key first exponent multiplied by a random<br>
integer kept secret by the first entity;<br>
the common number is chosen randomly from<br>
within a security interval and then sent by the second<br>
entity after having received the first element of<br>
proof; and<br>
the relationship verified by the second entity<br>
is an equality relationship between a power of the<br>
first element of proof and the first power of the<br>
generic number.<br>
The complex calculation, the execution of which is kept<br>
secret, relates in this case to the raising to the<br>
second power of the generic number in order to generate<br><br>
the first element of proof. The choice of the common<br>
number, chosen at random during the transaction, does<br>
not impair the speed of this transaction.<br>
In particular, in order to allow a message to be<br>
signed:<br>
the first element of proof is generated by the<br>
first entity by applying a standard hash function to<br>
the message and to the generic number raised to a<br>
second power modulo the modulus having a third exponent<br>
equal to the public key first exponent multiplied by a<br>
random integer kept secret by the first entity;<br>
the common number is equal to the first element<br>
of proof; and<br>
the relationship verified by the second entity<br>
is an equality relationship between the common number<br>
and a result of the standard hash function applied to<br>
the message and to the first power of the generic<br>
number.<br>
The complex calculation whose execution is kept secret<br>
relates in this case to the raising to the second power<br>
of the generic number in order to generate a potential<br>
of proof. The application of the standard hash function<br>
to the message and to this potential of proof no longer<br>
consumes considerable resources. The first entity may<br>
in this case calculate the potential of proof before<br>
the transaction in which transmission of the second<br>
element of proof and of the first element of proof<br>
equal to the common number shared with the second<br>
entity, then constitutes transmission of the signature<br>
of the message.<br>
In particular, in order to authenticate that a message<br>
received by the second entity comes from the first<br>
entity:<br>
the first element of proof is generated by the<br>
first entity by applying a standard hash function to<br>
the message and to the generic number raised to a<br><br>
second power modulo the modulus having a third exponent<br>
equal to the public key first exponent multiplied by a<br>
random integer kept secret by the first entity;<br>
the common number is chosen at random from<br>
within a security interval and then sent by the second<br>
entity after having received the first element of<br>
proof; and<br>
the relationship verified by the second entity<br>
is an equality relationship between the first element<br>
of proof and a result of the standard hash function<br>
applied to the message and to the first power of the<br>
generic number.<br>
The complex calculation kept secret relates here to the<br>
raising to the second power of the generic number in<br>
order to generate the first element of proof. The<br>
choice of the common number, chosen at random during<br>
the transaction by the second entity, does not impair<br>
the speed of this transaction.<br>
In general, the complex calculation that can be carried<br>
out before the transaction does not directly involve<br>
the private key and its result therefore gives no<br>
information about the private key.<br>
More particularly, the cryptographic method is<br>
noteworthy in that:<br>
the second element of proof is generated by the<br>
first entity by subtracting, from the random integer,<br>
the private key multiplied by the common number;<br>
the linear combination equal to the second<br>
exponent comprises a positive unitary coefficient for<br>
the common number and a positive unitary coefficient<br>
for the public key first exponent multiplied by the<br>
second element of proof; and<br>
in the verified relationship, the first element<br>
of proof is considered with a unitary exponent power.<br>
Alternatively, and preferably when the common number is<br><br>
chosen by the second entity, the cryptographic method<br>
is noteworthy in that:<br>
since the common number is split into a first<br>
elementary common number and a second elementary common<br>
number, the second element of proof is generated by the<br>
first entity by subtracting, from the random integer<br>
multiplied by the first elementary common number, the<br>
private key multiplied by the second elementary common<br>
number ;<br>
the linear combination equal to the second<br>
exponent comprises a zero coefficient for the first<br>
elementary common number, a positive unitary<br>
coefficient for the second elementary common number and<br>
a positive unitary coefficient for the public key first<br>
exponent multiplied by the second element of proof; and<br>
in the verified relationship, the first element<br>
of proof is considered with an exponent power equal to<br>
the first elementary common number.<br>
The simple subtraction and multiplication operations<br>
described above make it possible to rapidly calculate<br>
the second element of proof within a transaction and to<br>
repeat the transaction several times by generating each<br>
time a second element of proof related to another first<br>
element of proof via a different random number, without<br>
giving any information about the private key.<br>
Advantageously, the cryptographic method is noteworthy<br>
in that the second element of proof is calculated<br>
modulo an image of the modulus via a Carmichael<br>
function or modulo a multiple of the order of the<br>
generic number modulo the modulus.<br>
The random integer may be chosen to be very much<br>
greater than the private key. If the advantage<br>
mentioned in the previous paragraph is not applied, it<br>
is necessary for the random integer to be very much<br>
greater than the value of the private key.<br>
Advantageously, in order to reduce the number of<br><br>
operations needed for the exponentiation with the<br>
random number as exponent, the random integer is less<br>
than an image of the modulus via a Carmichael function<br>
or less than a multiple of the order of the generic<br>
number modulo the modulus. Such a random number cannot<br>
give any exploitable information about the private key.<br>
By reducing the size of the second element of proof<br>
thus obtained, it is possible to speed up the<br>
calculations to be made by the second entity without<br>
impairing security.<br>
Also advantageously, the cryptographic method is<br>
noteworthy in that the third exponent is calculated<br>
modulo an image of the modulus via a Carmichael<br>
function or modulo a multiple of the order of the<br>
generic number modulo the modulus.<br>
By reducing the size of the third exponent thus<br>
obtained, it is possible to speed up the calculations<br>
to be made by the first entity without impairing<br>
security.<br>
A value two assigned to the generic number facilitates<br>
the exponentiations to any power of the generic number.<br>
A small value may also be assigned to the generic<br>
number that makes it possible to distinguish each first<br>
entity, by applying a known hash function to the<br>
modulus and to the first exponent of the public key.<br>
An appreciable improvement to the cryptographic method<br>
for distinguishing the first entity is one whereby the<br>
generic number is transmitted with the public key, the<br>
generic number being equal to a simple number raised to<br>
a power modulo the modulus with the private key as<br>
exponent.<br>
All that the first entity then has to do is to raise<br>
the simple number to a power modulo the modulus with<br><br>
the random number as exponent so as to obtain the same<br>
result as by raising the generic number to a second<br>
power modulo the modulus having a third exponent equal<br>
to the public key first exponent multiplied by a random<br>
integer. By assigning the value two to the simple<br>
number, the complex calculation is considerably speeded<br>
up, whether this is carried out before or during the<br>
transaction.<br>
A further appreciable improvement to the cryptographic<br>
method is one whereby:<br>
a third entity receives the second element of<br>
proof, generates a third element of proof by raising<br>
the generic number to a power modulo the modulus with<br>
the second element of proof as exponent and sends the<br>
third element of proof to the second entity; and<br>
the second entity raises the third element of<br>
proof to a power modulo the modulus with the first<br>
exponent and multiplies the result thereof by the<br>
generic number raised to a power whose exponent is the<br>
common number in order to verify the relationship which<br>
relates the first element of proof to the second<br>
element of proof.<br>
The third entity makes it possible to relieve the<br>
second entity without impairing the integrity of the<br>
verification.<br>
Considering an intrusion-protected prover device<br>
provided with an RSA private key kept secret, in order<br>
to generate, during a transaction with a verifier<br>
device, a proof whose verification by means of a public<br>
key associated with said private key makes it possible<br>
to guarantee that the prover device is the origin of<br>
said proof, said RSA public key comprising a first<br>
exponent and a modulus, the prover device according to<br>
the invention is noteworthy in that it comprises:<br>
calculation means designed to generate a first<br>
element of proof, a first calculation of which consumes<br><br>
considerable resources, can be executed independently<br>
of the transaction and to generate a second element of<br>
proof related to the first element of proof and<br>
dependent on a common number specific to the<br>
transaction; and<br>
communication means . designed to transmit at<br>
least the first and the second elements of proof and<br>
designed to transmit said common number to the verifier<br>
device or to receive said common number therefrom.<br>
In particular, the prover device according to the<br>
invention is noteworthy in that:<br>
the calculation means are, on the one hand,<br>
designed to generate a first random number and to raise<br>
a generic number to a power modulo the modulus having<br>
an exponent equal to the public key first exponent<br>
multiplied by the random integer; and<br>
the calculation means are, on the other hand<br>
designed to generate the second element of proof by<br>
taking the difference between the random integer and<br>
the private key multiplied by the common number.<br>
Alternatively, the calculation means are designed to<br>
carry out operations modulo an image of the modulus via<br>
a Carmichael function or modulo a multiple of the order<br>
of the generic number modulo the modulus.<br>
Considering a verifier device for verifying that a<br>
proof originates from a prover device provided with an<br>
RSA private key kept secret by the prover device, by<br>
means of a public key associated with said private key,<br>
said RSA public key comprising an exponent and a<br>
modulus, the verifier device according to the invention<br>
is noteworthy in that it comprises:<br>
communication means designed to receive a first<br>
element of proof and a second element of proof or a<br>
third element of proof, and to receive or transmit a<br>
common number specific to a transaction within which<br>
the first and the second or the third element of proof<br><br>
are received; and<br>
calculation means designed to verify that the<br>
first element of proof is related through a<br>
relationship, modulo the modulus, with a first power of<br>
a generic number having a second exponent equal to a<br>
linear combination of the common number and of the<br>
public key first exponent multiplied by the second<br>
element of proof.<br>
In particular, the verifier device is noteworthy in<br>
that the communication means are designed to receive<br>
the second element of proof and in that the calculation<br>
means are designed to calculate the second exponent and<br>
said first power of the generic number.<br>
Alternatively, the verifier device is noteworthy in<br>
that the communication means are designed to receive<br>
the third element of proof and in that the calculation<br>
means are designed to raise the third element of proof<br>
to a power of the public key first exponent in order to<br>
multiply the result thereof by the generic number<br>
raised to a second power having the common number as<br>
exponent.<br>
The invention will be better understood from the<br>
illustrative examples described below with reference to<br>

authentication method involving an intermediate entity.<br>
The embodiment described here is an entity<br><br>
authentication or identification method. It allows a<br>
prover A to convince a verifier B of its authenticity.<br>
This method may be transformed into a method of<br>
authenticating a message or digital message signature<br>
as explained below. Its security relies on the<br>
difficulty of factorizing large integers. This<br>
difficulty is known to those skilled in the art as<br>
being at least as great as the difficulty of the<br>
problem on which the security of the RSA algorithm<br>
relies. In one option allowing the verification task to<br>
be facilitated, the security of the method is<br>
equivalent to RSA security.<br>
It will be recalled that a prime number is a number<br>
divisible only by one and by itself. It will also be<br>
recalled that the Euler function (p(z) of any positive<br>
integer z gives the cardinal number of the set of<br>
positive integers less than z and coprime to z, that is<br>
to say having no common factor with z other than 1. It<br>
will also be recalled that the Carmichael function X(w)<br>
of any positive integer w gives the smallest strictly<br>
positive integer v such that any integer u satisfies<br>
the relationship {uv = 1 modulo w}, that is to say, as<br>
is known, the remainder of the integer division of uv<br>
by w is equal to 1.<br>
According to the objective and to the results explained<br>
above, this method uses RSA keys. In order to<br>
constitute a prover device, a first entity A possesses<br>
firstly a public key disclosed to any second entity B,<br>
which constitutes a verifier device. The first entity A<br>
secondly possesses a private key kept secret. The<br>
public key comprises a modulus n and a first exponent<br>
e. The private key comprises a second exponent d. The<br>
modulus n is an integer equal to the pro.duct of two or<br>
more prime numbers. When the number n is a product of<br>
two prime numbers p and q, then (p(n) = (p-1) (q-1) . Many<br>
RSA descriptions specify that the modulus n, the first<br>
exponent e and the second exponent d satisfy the<br><br>
equation {ed = 1 modulo q(n)}. It is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art that when the equation {ed = 1<br>
modulo p(n)} is satisfied, then the equation {ed = 1<br>
modulo A(n)} is satisfied.<br>
More generally, the method operates with the same level<br>
of security for any public key (n,e) associated with a<br>
private key d that satisfies the equation {ed = 1<br>
modulo A(n)}.<br>
In ail the options, it is assumed that the verifier B<br>
already knows all the public parameters needed to<br>
verify that a proof is given by a first entity, the<br>
prover A, namely its identity, its public key, its<br>
public key certificate, etc.<br>
Identification of the entity A by the entity B takes<br>
place by iterating the protocol described here with<br>
reference to figure 1 k times. The number k is a<br>
positive integer which, with an integer t less than or<br>
equal to the exponent e, defines a pair of security<br>
parameters.<br>
In a first step 9, the entity A generates a first<br>
random integer r very much greater than d, calculates<br>
x = ger (mod n) and sends x to the entity B. In a known<br>
manner, the entities A and B are of the computer or<br>
chip card type. The integer g is a generic number known<br>
by the entities A and B. A value of the generic number<br>
g, equal to 2 facilitates its exponentiations. The<br>
generic number g may also be a function of the prover"s<br>
public key, for example g = h(n,e), where h is a hash<br>
function known to all. The generic number g may also be<br>
determined by the entity A and then transmitted with<br>
its public key. For example, the entity A raises a<br>
simple number G to the power d, the result of which<br>
gives the number g such that ge(mod n) = G. Since the<br>
generic number g is calculated once and for all by the<br>
entity A, the calculation of x is simplified, as in<br><br>
this case x = Gr(mod n) . A value of the simple number G<br>
equal to 2, facilitating its exponentiations, is more<br>
particularly advantageous. The expression (mod n) means<br>
modulo n, that is to say, as is known, the result of<br>
the calculation is equal to the remainder of the<br>
integer division of the result of the operation in<br>
question by the integer n, generally called the<br>
modulus. Here, the integer x constitutes a first<br>
element of proof, as only the entity that generates the<br>
random number r is capable of generating the number x.<br>
The random number r is not communicated by the entity<br>
that generates it. From known number theory, the number<br>
r is chosen to be large enough so that knowledge of the<br>
generic number g or of the simple number G and of the<br>
modulus n does not allow the number r to be recovered<br>
from the number x.<br>
Receipt by the entity B of the first element of proof x<br>
validates a transition 10, which then activates a<br>
second step 11.<br>
In step 11, the entity B sends to the entity A an<br>
integer c chosen at random from within an interval<br>
[0,t-1] called the security interval. Thus, the number<br>
c is common to the entities A and B and also to any<br>
other entity infiltrating the dialogue between the<br>
entities A and B.<br>
Receipt of the common number c by the entity A<br>
validates a transition 12, which then activates a third<br>
step 13.<br>
In step 13, the entity A calculates y = r - dc. Thus,<br>
the entity A generates an image y of the private key in<br>
the form of a linear combination of the number r and of<br>
the number d, the multiplicative coefficient of which<br>
is the common number c. Since the random number r is<br>
very large and not communicated, knowledge of the image<br>
y does not allow the product dc to be recovered and<br><br>
consequently prevents recovery of the private key<br>
number d, which therefore remains kept secret by the<br>
entity A. Since only the entity A knows the number d,<br>
only the entity A can generate an image that integrates<br>
the common number C.<br>
Considering the protocols described here, an imposter<br>
is an entity that attempts to pass off as the entity A<br>
without knowing the secret of the private key d. It can<br>
be demonstrated that, when the factorization of the<br>
integers is a difficult problem, the probability of the<br>
imposter not being detected is equal to 1/kt. The<br>
security of these protocols is therefore at least as<br>
great as that of RSA. For many applications, the<br>
product kt may be chosen to be relatively small within<br>
an authentication context, for example of the order of<br>
216.<br>
Any values of k and t of the pair of security<br>
parameters are possible. Preferably, k = 1 and t = e,<br>
in which case the probability defined above is equal to<br>
1/e and there is only one verification equation to be<br>
applied. A standard RSA public exponent value such that<br>
e = 65537, i.e. 216+1, is suitable for many<br>
applications.<br>
Receipt by the entity B of the second element of proof<br>
y validates a transition 16, which then activates a <br>
fourth step 17.<br>
In step 17, the entity B verifies that gey+c = x(mod n).<br>
Although, as seen above, the second element of proof<br>
communicates no information about the private key d,<br>
the second element of proof y is such that:<br>
ey + c = e(r - dc) + c.<br>
Therefore, by raising the generic number g to a power<br>
whose exponent is a linear combination of the common<br>
number c and the product ey, then:<br>
gey+c = ger (g-ed+1)c = x(mod n).<br><br>
Moreover, although according to number theory the<br>
generic number g communicates no information about the<br>
private key, the generic number g is in fact such that:<br>
(gdc)e = gc(mod n) .<br>
Thus, without communicating r at any time, the<br>
equality:<br>
(gy)egc = (gr)e = x(mod n)<br>
certifies that the entity A knows d.<br>
This verification is speeded up by calculating in<br>
advance, at the end of step 11 or even before it:<br>
V" = gc(mod n) .<br>
Thus, in the fourth step, B no longer has to verify:<br>
geyv" = x(mod n). When B receives y, it is advantageous<br>
for B to calculate once and for all G = ge(mod n) so as<br>
to verify, in step 11, Gyv" = x(mod n) . Other possible<br>
ways of optimizing the verification calculation will be<br>
given in the rest of the description.<br>
Many different ways of optimizing this basic protocol<br>
are possible. For example, x = ger(mod n) may be<br>
replaced with x = g-er(mod n), in which case the<br>
verification equation becomes gey+cx = 1 (mod n) .<br>
Again, for example, it is possible to replace c with a<br>
pair of positive or negative integers (a,b) and to<br>
replace y = r - dc with y = ar - bd, in which case the<br>
verification equation becomes gey+b = xa(mod n) .<br>
If the prime number factors of the modulus n are known<br>
from A, then the first step may be speeded up using<br>
what is called the "Chinese remainders" technique.<br>
The first step may be carried out in advance. Moreover,<br>
the k values of x may form part of A"s public key, in<br>
which case the protocol commences directly at the<br><br>
second step. These values of x may also be calculated<br>
by an external entity worthy of confidence and stored<br>
in the entity A.<br>
When the precalculated values of the first element of<br>
proof are joined to the public key, the protocol within<br>
a transaction commences directly with step 11. it is<br>
the entity B which decides on the number k of<br>
iterations of steps 11 and 13 for each of which the<br>
entity B verifies, in step 17, that there exists a<br>
value of the first element of proof x that is equal to<br>
V. The entity A is again the only one to know the<br>
random numbers that correspond to a first element of<br>
proof.<br>
To be able to store a maximum number of precalculated<br>
values in a memory of the entity A, particularly when<br>
the entity A is integrated in a microcircuit of a chip<br>
card, in the case of a credit card or a mobile<br>
telephone, the number x may be replaced with a value<br>
f(x) where f is a function, for example equal to (or<br>
including) a cryptographic hash function, in which case<br>
the verification equation becomes: f(gey+c(mod n)) =<br>
f(x) .<br>
All or some of the above modifications may be combined.<br>
One useful improvement to the method consists in<br>
storing an image X(n) of the modulus n via the<br>
3 Carmichael function in the memory of the entity A.<br>
So as to reduce the size of the second element of proof<br>
y, in order to reduce the verification time without<br>
thereby modifying the verification equation, the second<br>
3 element of proof y is calculated modulo ?(n) in step<br>
13. In this method of implementation, the random number<br>
r is advantageously chosen to be less than ?(n) in step<br>
11. More generally, the expression {y = r - dc} may be<br>
replaced with any expression {y = r - dc - i?(n)},<br><br>
where i is any integer, preferably a positive integer.<br>
So as to speed up execution of step 11, prior to the<br>
exponential operation applied to the generic number g,<br>
the product er is calculated modulo ?(n).<br>
An equivalent means consists in replacing ?(n) with the<br>
order of g modulo n, that is to say the smallest non<br>
zero integer l such that gt = 1 modulo n, or more<br>
generally by any multiple of this order t.<br>
Referring to figure 5, the verification calculation<br>
executed by the entity B may also be partially<br>
delegated to any entity other than B, without any loss<br>
of security. In this case, A supplies the second<br>
element of proof y to this other entity C. The entity C<br>
generates a third element of proof Y from the second<br>
element of proof y and sends the third element of proof<br>
Y to the entity B. Firstly, knowing y provides no<br>
information about d, since the product dc is "masked"<br>
by the random number r. Secondly, it is virtually<br>
impossible for a fraudster to manufacture Y from all<br>
parts, that is to say without the second element of<br>
proof y being exclusively generated by the first entity<br>
A. This is because, given n, e, x and c, it is<br>
unfeasible to find a value of Y that satisfies the<br>
verification equation of the fourth step if the<br>
factorization is a difficult problem.<br>
The public key is the pair (n,e) and the authentication<br>
or identification of the entity A by the entity B takes<br>
place by iterating the protocol described here k times,<br>
where C denotes any entity other than B. Compared with<br>
other protocols of the prior art in which, for example,<br>
in the discrete logarithm case the public key is a<br>
quadruplet (n, e, g, v) , the reduction in number of<br>
components of the public key reduces the number of<br>
operations to be carried out without impairing<br>
security. Advantageously, according to the invention,<br><br>
the public key used here is of RSA type, the protocol<br>
described being easily integrated into a widely<br>
exploited RSA context.<br>
The method is carried out in a manner identical to that<br>
described with reference to figure 1 up to step 13.<br>
With reference to figure 5, step 13 is modified in that<br>
the entity A sends the image y of the private key d to<br>
the intermediate entity C. As seen above, the image y<br>
gives no information about the private key.<br>
Receipt by the entity C of the image y validates a<br>
transition 14, which therefore activates the fifth step<br>
15.<br>
In step 15, it is in this case the intermediate entity<br>
C that calculates the third element of proof<br>
Y = gy(mod n) and sends Y to B.<br>
The procedure then continues in the same way as that<br>
described with reference to figure 1 via the transition<br>
16 and step 17. However, step 17 is modified in that<br>
the second entity B now has only to raise the third<br>
element of proof Y to a power of exponent e and to<br>
multiply the result thereof by gc(mod n).<br>
Physically, the intermediate entity C is, for example,<br>
incorporated into a chip, which is not necessarily<br>
security protected, contained in the security device of<br>
the prover, such as a chip card, in the security device<br>
of the verifier, such as a payment terminal, or else in<br>
another device, such as a computer. The security lies<br>
in the fact that the entity C cannot by itself find a<br>
suitable value Y, that is to say such that the<br>
verification equation is satisfied.<br>
The protocols described above may be converted into<br>
message authentication protocols or into digital<br>
signature schemes.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows steps of a method that makes it possible<br>
to authenticate that a message M received by the second<br>
entity B was sent by the first entity A.<br>
In a first step 20, the entity A generates a first<br>
random integer r very much greater than d and<br>
calculates a potential of proof P using a formula such<br>
that P = ger(mod n) as in step 9 in the case of the<br>
first element of proof. Instead of sending P to the<br>
entity B, the entity A generates a first element of<br>
proof x by applying, to the message M, jointly with the<br>
number P, a function h equal, for example, to a<br>
cryptographic hash function or including a<br>
cryptographic hash function such that:<br>
x = h(P,M).<br>
Next, the entity A sends the message M and the first<br>
element of proof x to the entity B.<br>
Receipt of the message M and of the first element of<br>
proof x by the entity B validates a transition 21,<br>
which activates a second step 11. The procedure then<br>
continues in the same way as that described with<br>
reference to either figure 1 or figure 5.<br>
In step 11, the entity B sends the entity A an integer<br>
c chosen at random from within an interval [0,t-1]<br>
called the security interval. Thus, the number c is<br>
common to the entities A and B and also to any other<br>
entity infiltrating the dialogue between the entities A<br>
and B.<br>
Receipt by the entity A of the common number c<br>
validates a transition 12, which then activates a third<br>
step 13.<br>
In step 13, the entity A calculates y = r - dc. Thus,<br>
the entity A generates an image y of the private key in<br><br>
the form of a linear combination of the number r and<br>
the number d, the multiplicative coefficient of which<br>
is the common number c. Since the random number r is<br>
very large and not communicated, knowledge of the image<br>
y does not allow the product dc to be recovered, and<br>
consequently does not allow recovery of the private key<br>
number d that therefore remains kept secret by the<br>
entity A. Since only the entity A knows the number d,<br>
only the entity A can generate an image that integrates<br>
the common number c. In the example, shown in figure 3,<br>
the entity A sends the private key image y to the<br>
entity B, but may also send it to an intermediate<br>
entity C as in figure 5. As was seen previously, the<br>
image y gives no information about the private key.<br>
Receipt of the image y by the entity B validates a<br>
transition 16, which then activates the fourth step 22.<br>
In step 22, the entity B calculates, as in step 17, a<br>
verification value V by means of the formula:<br>
V = gc+ey(mod n)<br>
and then verifies the match of the second element of<br>
proof with the first element of proof by means of the<br>
verification equation:<br>
h(V,M) = x.<br>
In the variant using a function f, the verification<br>
equation becomes h(f(gc+ey(mod n)),M) = x.<br>
In the variant using a function f and involving the<br>
intermediate entity C, the verification equation<br>
becomes h(f (Yegc(mod n)),M) = x.<br>
Unlike the message authentication, the message<br>
signature is independent of the sender in the sense<br>
that the signature of a message M by the entity A<br>
remains valid if the entity B receives the message M<br>
from any other entity. A size not less than twenty-four<br>
bits for the public key exponent e is recommended in<br><br>
order to guarantee an acceptable level of security.<br>
Referring to figure 2, in a first step 18, the entity A<br>
generates a first random integer r and calculates a<br>
potential of proof P = ger(mod n) .<br>
In a second step 23 directly after step 1, the entity A<br>
generates a first element of proof x by applying, to<br>
the message M, jointly with the number P, a function h,<br>
for example equal to a cryptographic hash function or<br>
including a cryptographic hash function, such that:<br>
x = h(P,M).<br>
In step 23, the entity A generates the common number c<br>
taken equal to the first element of proof x.<br>
In a third step 24 directly after step 23, the entity A<br>
calculates y = r - dc. Thus, the entity A generates an<br>
image y of the private key in the form of a linear<br>
combination of the number r and the number d, the<br>
multiplicative coefficient of which is the common<br>
number c. Since the random number r is very large and<br>
not communicated, knowing the image y does not allow<br>
the product dc to be recovered and consequently does<br>
not allow recovery of the private key number d, which<br>
therefore remains kept secret by the entity A. Since<br>
only the entity A knows the number d, only the entity A<br>
can generate an image that integrates the common number<br>
c. As was seen above, the image y gives no information<br>
about the private key. The pair (x,y) constitutes a<br>
signature of the message M since this pair integrates<br>
both the message M and a private key element that<br>
guarantees that the entity A is the source of this<br>
signature.<br>
The entity A then sends the message M and the signature<br>
(x,y) to the entity B or to any other entity that will<br>
subsequently be able to send the signed message to the<br>
entity B.<br><br>
It should be noted that the message M is not<br>
necessarily sent at step 24. The message M may be sent<br>
in step 19 independently of its signature, since any<br>
modification of the message M would have a negligible<br>
chance of being compatible with its signature.<br>
Receipt by the entity B of the message M with its<br>
signature (x,y), originating from the entity A or from<br>
any other entity, validates a transition 25, which then<br>
activates a step 26.<br>
In step 26, the entity B takes the common number c as<br>
being equal to the first element of proof x.<br>
In step 26, the entity B calculates, as in step 17, a<br>
verification value V by means of the formula:<br>
V = gc+ey(mod n)<br>
and then verifies the match of the second element of<br>
proof with the first element of proof by means of the<br>
verification equation:<br>
h(V,M) = x<br>
In this case, the match with the first element of proof<br>
is verified by this equality owing to the fact that the<br>
common number c generated in step 23 itself matches the<br>
first element of proof.<br>
In the variant using a function f, the verification<br>
equation becomes h(f (gc+ey (mod n)),M) = x.<br>
One particularly efficient implementation of the method<br>
of the invention will now be explained with reference<br>
to figure 4.<br>
A step 27 generates, and stores in a memory of the<br>
entity A, one or more random number values r(j"),<br>
associated with each of which is a potential of proof<br>
P(j")- The index j" serves to establish, in a table, a<br><br>
correspondence between each random number r(j") and the<br>
associated potential of proof P(j"). Each random number<br>
r(j") is generated so as to be either substantially-<br>
greater than the private key d, or less than or equal<br>
to A(n), as explained above. Each potential of proof<br>
P(j") is calculated as a power of the simple number G<br>
with r(j") as exponent. Step 27 is executed for each<br>
row of index j" by incrementing modulo a length k" the<br>
index j" after each calculation of P(j"). The length k"<br>
represents the number of rows of the table such that,<br>
with j" = 0 indexing the first row of the table, the<br>
executions of step 27 stop when j " becomes zero again<br>
or they continue in order to renew the values contained<br>
in the table. The length k" has a value equal to or<br>
greater than k.<br>
The calculation of P(j") is carried out by the entity A<br>
or by a confidential entity that receives, from the<br>
entity A, the random number r(j") or the value ?(n) in<br>
order to choose random numbers r(j") less than or equal<br>
to ?(n) . When the calculation of P(j") is carried out<br>
by the entity A, each execution of step 27 is activated<br>
by a transition 28, which is validated when digital<br>
processing means of the entity A are detected free.<br>
The simple number G is determined in an initial step<br>
29. When the generic number g is set, and therefore<br>
known to all, the entity A simply needs to communicate<br>
the public key (n,e) and the simple number G is<br>
calculated so that G = ge modulo n. When the generic<br>
number g is not set, the entity A chooses a value of G,<br>
for example G = 2 and generates g = Gd modulo n. The<br>
generic number g is then transmitted with the public<br>
key. The index j" is set to zero so as to start a first<br>
execution of step 27 for the first row. of the table.<br>
Each end of execution of step 27 is connected back to<br>
the output of step 29 in order to scan the transition<br>
28 and, with priority, the transitions 40, 41, 42.<br><br>
The transition 42 is validated by an identification<br>
transaction, which then activates a series of steps 43<br>
and 45.<br>
Step 43 positions an iteration index j, for example<br>
equal to the current index j" of the table containing<br>
the random numbers and the associated potentials of<br>
proof.<br>
In step 45, the entity A generates the first element x<br>
by simply reading the potential of proof P(j) from the<br>
table. During the transaction detected by validation of<br>
the transition 42, generation of the first element of<br>
proof therefore requires no power calculation. The<br>
first element of proof x is thus rapidly transmitted.<br>
A transition 1 is validated by receipt of the common<br>
number c, which then activates a step 2.<br>
In step 2, the entity A generates the second element of<br>
proof y as explained above. Since the operations are<br>
limited to a few multiplications and additions or<br>
subtractions, they require little computation time. The<br>
second element of proof y is thus transmitted rapidly<br>
after receipt of the common number c.<br>
In step 2, the index p is increased by a unitary<br>
increment so as to repeat step 45 and step 2, as long<br>
as j is detected in a transition 3, different from j"<br>
modulo k, until a transition 4 detects that j is equal<br>
to j" modulo k, in order to return to the output of<br>
step 29 after k executions of step 45.<br>
The transition 41 is validated by a signature<br>
transaction of the message M. The transition 41 then<br>
activates a series of steps 44 and 46.<br>
Step 44 positions an iteration index j, for example<br>
equal to the current index j" of the table containing<br><br>
the random numbers and the associated potentials of<br>
proof. The message M is transmitted at step 44.<br>
In step 46, the entity A generates the first element of<br>
proof x by applying the standard hash function h() to<br>
the message M and to the result of simply reading the<br>
potential of proof P(j) from the table. The common<br>
number c is taken equal to the first element of proof<br>
x.<br>
In step 46, the entity A generates the second element<br>
of proof y as explained above. Since the operations are<br>
limited to a few multiplications and additions or<br>
subtractions, they require little computation time.<br>
During the transaction detected by validation of the<br>
transition 41, generation of the signature consisting<br>
of the first element of proof x and the second element<br>
of proof y, therefore requires no power calculation.<br>
The signature (x,y) is thus rapidly transmitted.<br>
Optionally in step 46, the index j is increased by a<br>
unitary increment so as to repeat step 46 as long as j<br>
is detected in a transition 3, different from j " modulo<br>
k, until a transition 4 detects that j is equal to j"<br>
modulo k in order to return to the output of step 29<br>
after k executions of step 46.<br>
The transition 40 is validated by a transaction for<br>
authenticating the message M. The transition 40 then .<br>
activates a series of steps 43 and 47.<br>
Step 43 positions an iteration index j, for example<br>
equal to the current index j" of the table containing<br>
the random numbers and the associated potentials of<br>
proof.<br>
In step 47, the entity A transmits the message M and<br>
the first element of proof x. The first element of<br>
proof x is generated by applying the standard hash<br><br>
function h() to the message M and to the result of<br>
simply reading the potential of proof P(j) from the<br>
table.<br>
During the transaction detected by validation of the<br>
transition 40, generation of the first element of proof<br>
therefore requires no power calculation. The first<br>
element of proof x is thus rapidly transmitted.<br>
A transition 1 is validated by receipt of the common<br>
number c, which then activates a step 48.<br>
In step 48, the entity A generates the second element<br>
of proof y as explained above. Since the operations are<br>
limited to a few multiplications and additions or<br>
subtractions, they require little computation time. The<br>
second element of proof y is thus rapidly transmitted<br>
after receipt of the common number c.<br>
In step 48, the index p is increased by a unitary<br>
increment so as to repeat step 47 and step 48 as long<br>
as j is detected in a transition 3, different from j"<br>
modulo k, until a transition 4 detects that p is equal<br>
to j" modulo k in order to return to the output of step<br>
29 after k executions of step 47.<br>
