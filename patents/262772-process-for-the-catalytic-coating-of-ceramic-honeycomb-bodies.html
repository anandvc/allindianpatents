				<td>Process for the catalytic coating of ceramic honeycomb bodies<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a process for coating ceramic honeycomb bodies with a coating<br>
suspension containing, in a carrier liquid, catalyst components as solids and/or in<br>
5 dissolved form. The coated honeycomb bodies are preferably used for the purification<br>
of exhaust gases from automobiles.<br>
Catalysts applied in the form of a coating to honeycomb bodies have been used for<br>
decades for the purification of exhaust gases from automobiles. The honeycomb bodies<br>
have parallel flow channels for the exhaust gases running through them. Ceramic<br>
10 honeycomb bodies are produced from highly refractory materials. The majority are<br>
made of cordierite, a magnesium-aluminium silicate. Further ceramic materials<br>
customarily used are silicon carbide, aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide, zirconium<br>
mullite, mullite, silicon nitride, barium titanate and titanium oxide. The honeycomb<br>
bodies are produced from these materials by extrusion and generally have an open pore<br>
15 structure.<br>
The flow channels run through the honeycomb bodies from an entry end face to the exit<br>
end face. The channels generally have a square cross section and are arranged in a<br>
closely spaced grid over the cross section of the honeycomb bodies. The number of flow<br>
channels per unit cross-sectional area is referred to as the cell density and can be from<br>
20 10 to 200 cm-2<br>
The catalytic coating of the honeycomb bodies is a dispersion coating which is applied<br>
to the honeycomb bodies using a usually aqueous suspension of the catalyst<br>
components. This coating will hereinafter also be referred to as a washcoat.<br>
The catalyst components contain, for example, finely divided support materials having a<br>
25 high specific surface area to which the catalytically active components, usually the<br>
noble metals of the platinum group platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium and<br>
ruthenium have been applied. The solids in the catalyst suspension are generally<br>
homogenized by wet milling before application to the honeycomb bodies. After milling,<br>
the solids of the suspension have an average particle size d50 in the range from 3 to<br>
30 5 Âµm.<br>
Examples of support materials are simple and mixed oxides, e.g. active aluminium<br><br>
oxide, zirconium oxide, tin oxide, cerium oxide or other rare earth oxides, silicon oxide,<br>
titanium oxide, and silicates such as aluminium silicate or titanates such as barium or<br>
aluminium titanate and zeolites. The various phases of active aluminium oxide of the<br>
transition series, which can be stabilized by doping with silicon oxide and lanthanum<br>
5 oxide or else by zirconium oxide and cerium oxide, have been found to be particularly<br>
useful as heat-resistant support materials.<br>
If reference is made in the following to coating of the honeycomb bodies with a<br>
catalytically active layer, what is meant is the coating of the channel walls of the flow<br>
channels. Coating of the outer wall of the honeycomb body is undesirable. The amount<br>
10 of coating applied is generally based on the external volume of the honeycomb body in<br>
gram per litre. A person skilled in the art will be sufficiently familiar with customary<br>
methods of carrying out such coatings.<br>
To meet the necessary requirements, the coating has to have a concentration which<br>
depends on the particular task. In general, the concentration has to be greater the more<br>
15 active and more ageing resistant the coating is to be. In practice, from 10 to 300 g/1 are<br>
required, depending on the application. However, the maximum achievable<br>
concentration can for various reasons be below the catalytically required concentration.<br>
Thus, the adhesion of the coating decreases with increasing concentration and thus layer<br>
thickness. Furthermore, high layer thicknesses reduce the hydraulic diameter of the flow<br>
20 channels and thus increase the exhaust gas counterpressure (back pressure) of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
There are applications, for example the oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide<br>
in diesel exhaust gas ("diesel oxidation catalyst"), in which only a relatively low mass<br>
of catalyst in the range from 100 to 200 g per litre of honeycomb body volume is<br>
25 necessary for the reaction. A further increase in the mass of catalyst while maintaining<br>
the total noble metal content is in this case not associated with an activity advantage. In<br>
the case of other catalytic reactions, for example the storage and reduction of nitrogen<br>
oxides ("nitrogen oxide storage catalyst") or the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen<br>
oxides by means of ammonia ("SCR catalyst"), on the other hand, an increase in the<br>
30 mass of active material is desirable but is possible only within limits because of the<br>
abovementioned problems with the adhesion of the coating and the back pressure of the<br>
finished catalyst.<br>
To reduce the high back pressure, US 5,334,570 proposes relocating the catalytic<br>
coating into the pores of ceramic honeycomb bodies. The ceramic honeycomb bodies<br><br>
used in this patent had an open porosity of from 30 to 45% and an average pore<br>
diameter of from 3 to 10 Âµm. For this reason, catalyst materials which have colloidal<br>
particle diameters in the range from 0.001 to 0.1 Âµm, preferably from 0.001 to 0.05 Âµm,<br>
and penetrate into the pores of the honeycomb bodies when the honeycomb bodies are<br>
5 brought into contact with a corresponding colloidal coating dispersion were used for<br>
catalytic coating. According to the patent, the honeycomb bodies were dipped into the<br>
coating dispersion in order to contact them with the coating dispersion. In this way,<br>
from 90 to 95% of the colloidal washcoat particles could be deposited in the pores of<br>
the honeycomb bodies, so that the cross section of the flow channels was barely reduced<br>
10 by the coating and the back pressure was therefore increased only insignificantly.<br>
Ceramic honeycomb bodies having a significantly increased porosity of from about 60<br>
to 65% and average pore diameters of from 10 to 20 Âµm have been developed in recent<br>
years. The objective here was to make the channel walls permeable to the catalyst<br>
particles so that the particles can deposit not only as a layer on the channel surface but<br>
15 also in the pore system of the wall. It is therefore possible to achieve lower layer<br>
thicknesses for a comparable mass of catalyst or, conversely, higher loading<br>
concentrations at equal catalyst layer thickness [Tao et al., SAE 2004-01-1293].<br>
To coat honeycomb bodies, the catalytically active, water-insoluble, pulverulent<br>
components are usually suspended in water or an organic liquid, milled and the<br>
20 substrate is subsequently coated by dipping into the suspension, by pouring the<br>
suspension over it or by sucking in or pumping in the suspension.<br>
If the above-described, newly developed porous honeycomb bodies are used here, part<br>
of the catalytically active substances actually penetrates into the pore system of the<br>
honeycomb body and deposits there. However, the processes described do not allow the<br>
25 pores of the honeycomb body to be filled completely and thus be optimally utilized.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for coating porous<br>
honeycomb bodies which allows both the geometric surfaces of the flow channels and<br>
the pores of the channel walls to be coated in a defined manner with a catalyst. The<br>
objective is to increase the amount of catalytically active components in the walls of the<br>
30 honeycomb bodies for optimizing the back pressure behaviour after coating with an<br>
equal mass of catalyst or to increase the active mass at a comparable back pressure<br>
behaviour after coating.<br>
The process uses ceramic honeycomb bodies through which parallel flow channels<br><br>
separated from one another by channel walls having an open pore structure run from an<br>
entry end face to an exit end face. Coating is carried out using a catalyst suspension<br>
containing solids suspended in a carrier liquid. The process is characterized in that the<br>
flow channels are alternately temporarily closed at the entry and exit end face, the<br>
5 catalyst suspension is allowed to flow through the honeycomb body from the entry face<br>
to the exit face and the alternately closed flow channels are subsequently opened again.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term honeycomb bodies refers to flow-<br>
through honeycomb bodies whose flow channels are open at both ends. According to<br>
the invention, these flow channels are temporarily alternately closed at the entry and<br>
10 exit end face for the purpose of carrying out coating. These are in contrast to wall-flow<br>
honeycomb bodies whose flow channels are permanently alternately closed at the entry<br>
and exit end face.<br>
In contrast to conventional coating processes for honeycomb bodies, the present process<br>
forces the coating suspension to flow through the pore system of the material of the<br>
15 channel walls during the coating procedure. In this way, the surfaces of the pores are<br>
coated in a targeted manner. Depending on the particle size distribution of the solids in<br>
the coating suspension and on the average pore diameter of the ceramic material of the<br>
honeycomb body, this results in more or less pronounced filtration of the coating<br>
suspension. It is thus possible to set the mass ratio of the coating suspension deposited<br>
20 in the pores to the coating suspension deposited on the channel walls in a defined<br>
manner by appropriate choice of the particle size distribution. However, preference is<br>
given to filling the pores of the channel walls as completely as possible with catalyst<br>
composition in order to keep the coating on the wall surfaces as low as possible at the<br>
desired coating concentration. At an appropriately low coating concentration, it is even<br>
25 possible to accommodate all of the catalyst composition in the pores.<br>
The catalyst suspension can be sucked through or pumped through the honeycomb<br>
bodies. As an alternative, the honeycomb bodies can be dipped into the catalyst<br>
suspension or have the catalyst suspension poured over them, as long as it is ensured<br>
that in this procedure the coating suspension has to pass through the channel walls.<br>
30 The temporary alternate closure of the flow channels is effected using the methods<br>
known for producing alternately closed wall flow filters. As in the case of wall flow<br>
filters, the thickness of the temporary closure is restricted to a few millimetres.<br>
The sealing compositions are not subject to any restrictions. They merely have to be<br><br>
able to be introduced into the flow channels by known methods and be solid at the usual<br>
working temperatures for coating honeycomb bodies. The honeycomb bodies are<br>
usually coated at room temperature. Suitable sealing compositions are, for example,<br>
compositions which melt or vaporize at elevated temperature, preferably above 80Â°C,<br>
5 can be dissolved out by means of solvents or can be decomposed thermally or reacted<br>
chemically. The latter category includes, in particular, organic sealing compositions<br>
which can either be burnt or ashed. Suitable compositions of this type are, for example,<br>
water-insoluble fillers which can be burnt out, e.g. natural or synthetic waxes, in<br>
particular paraffin wax, or polymers such as polyethylene wax. Preference is given to<br>
10 waxes having a melting point above 80Â°C.<br>
Honeycomb bodies suitable for the process of the invention are in general all porous<br>
honeycomb bodies having open porosity. Depending on the average pore size, the solids<br>
of the coating dispersion have to have a correspondingly small particle diameter. In the<br>
case of average pore sizes in the range from 3 to 10 Âµm, preference is given to using<br>
15 solids having average particle diameters in the colloidal range (
having an average particle size d50 in the range from 3 to 5 urn or from 1 to 3 Âµm are<br>
also suitable. It is, however, also possible to use solids having a wide particle size range<br>
or solids having a multimodal particle size distribution. Filtration then occurs during<br>
coating: particles having small particle diameters are deposited in the pores of the<br>
20 honeycomb body while the larger particles are deposited on the channel walls.<br>
However, preference is given to using highly porous honeycomb bodies having a<br>
porosity in the range from 30 to 90% and an average pore diameter in the range from 10<br>
to 50 Âµm.<br>
The process of the invention allows, compared to standard honeycomb bodies, more<br>
25 catalytically active composition to be applied to the support at a comparable layer<br>
thickness on the channel surface or at a comparable hydraulic diameter of the flow<br>
channel.<br>
The following examples and Figures 1 and 5 illustrate the invention. The figures show<br>

30	conventionally coated honeycomb body as per Comparative Example 1<br>

C) conventionally coated honeycomb body<br>
Example 1<br>
The flow channels of a cordierite honeycomb body were closed alternately by means of<br>
a paraffin wax. The honeycomb body had a diameter of 14.4 cm, a length of 15.24 and a<br>
10 cell density of 46.5 cm-2 and a thickness of the channel walls of 0.3 mm. The porosity of<br>
the material was 65% at an average pore diameter of 22 Âµm.<br>
This honeycomb body was coated with a conventional SCR catalyst comprising a<br>
titanium dioxide powder on which 1.5% by weight of vanadium pentoxide and 9.3% by<br>
weight of tungsten had been deposited. For this purpose, the titanium oxide powder was<br>
15 suspended in water and milled by means of a Dyno mill to an average particle diameter<br>
d50 of less than 1 Âµm and d90 of 
honeycomb body and excess washcoat was sucked out at the rear side of the filter by<br>
application of a vacuum. Repetition of this procedure one more time resulted in the<br>
honeycomb body being coated with an amount of catalyst of 240 g per litre of<br>
20 honeycomb body volume. After coating, the honeycomb body was dried and calcined so<br>
that the alternate paraffin seals of the flow channels were melted and burnt.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
For comparison, a honeycomb body identical to that in Example 1 was coated with the<br>
catalyst suspension without prior alternate closure of the flow channels, dried and<br>
25 calcined. The mass of catalyst after coating was 234 g/1.<br>
To examine the layer thickness distribution, transverse sections of the catalysts were<br>
prepared and examined in a scanning electron microscope. Drawings of corresponding<br>
photographs are shown in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section of the honeycomb body (1) coated as described in<br>
30 Comparative Example 1. Figure 2 shows an enlargement of part II of Figure 1. The<br>
reference numeral (2) denotes the flow channels of the honeycomb body and (3) denotes<br><br>
its cordierite framework having the pores (4). Virtually all the catalyst material is<br>
present as coating (5b) on the channel walls. Only a small part (5a) has penetrated into<br>
the pores of the cordierite framework in the surface region of the channel walls,<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the cross sections corresponding to Figures 1 and 2 for the<br>
5 catalyst coated as described in Example 1. As a result of the coating suspension being<br>
pumped through the channel walls bounding the flow channels, the pores of the<br>
cordierite framework have been filled with catalyst material both in the interior of the<br>
channel walls (5c) and in the surface region of the channel walls (5a). Further coating<br>
material (5b) is present on the channel walls since, at the chosen coating concentration<br>
10 of about 240 g/1, it is not possible for the entire catalyst material to be accommodated in<br>
the pores of the channel walls.<br>
Example 2<br>
To measure the back pressure of honeycomb bodies according to the invention and<br>
conventionally coated honeycomb bodies, two further honeycomb bodies having the<br>
15 same dimensions as in the above examples were coated with an iron-exchanged zeolite<br>
by methods analogous to Example 1 and Comparative Example 1. The coating<br>
concentration on the honeycomb body coated according to the invention was 330 g/1 of<br>
honeycomb body volume and that on the conventionally coated honeycomb body was<br>
327.5 g/1.<br>
20 The back pressure caused by these honeycomb bodies was measured as a function of the<br>
flow of air through the body. An uncoated honeycomb body was also examined for<br>
comparison. The results of these measurements are shown in Figure 5. Curve A is the<br>
back pressure for the uncoated honeycomb body, curve B is that for the honeycomb<br>
body coated according to the invention and curve C is that for the conventionally coated<br>
25 honeycomb body.<br>
The honeycomb body coated according to the invention displays a significantly lower<br>
back pressure than the conventionally coated honeycomb body. Although only a small<br>
proportion of the coating composition can be taken up by the pores in the channel walls<br>
at the chosen coating concentration of greater than 300 g/1, this has a very positive<br>
30 effect on the back pressure.<br><br>

suspension containing, in a carrier liquid, catalyst components as solids and/or in<br>
dissolved form. The honeycomb bodies have parallel flow channels running through<br>
them. The walls of the flow channels generally have an open pore structure. To coat the<br>
