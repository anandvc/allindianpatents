				<td>SYNTHESIS OF p-L-2'-DEOXY NUCLEOSIDES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This invention claims priority to U.S. Provisional No. 60/483,711, filed June 30, 2003, and 60/558,616, filed April 1, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the field of processes for preparing 2'-deoxy- or 2'-modified-nucleosides and particularly p-L-2'-deoxythymidine. The present invention is an improved process that is easily scalable for purposes of industrial manufacture. The compounds prepared according to the process of the present invention are important as antiviral agents, antineoplastic agents, and intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds and compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of human cancer. The mechanism by which HBV induces cancer is unknown, although it is postulated that it may directly trigger tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation, cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection.<br>
Hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. After a two to six month incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood levels of certain enzymes. HBV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often fatal form of the disease in which massive sections of the liver are destroyed.<br><br>
Patients typically recover from acute hepatitis. In some patients, however, high levels of viral antigen persist in the blood for an extended, or indefinite, period, causing a chronic infection. Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with chronic persistent HBV are most common in developing countries. By mid-1991, there were approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost 300 million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer.<br>

Sec also WO 00/09531. A method for the treatment of hepatitis B infection in humans and other host animals is disclosed thai includes administering an effective amount of a biologically active 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentoluranonucleoside (alternatively referred to as p-L-dN or a p-L-2'-dN) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof, including p-L-deoxyribothymidine (p-L-dT), p-L-deoxyribocytidine (p-L-dC), p-L-deoxyribouridine (P-L-dU), p-L-deoxyribo-guanosine (p-L-dG), p-L-deoxyriboadenosine (p-L-dA) and P-L-deoxyriboinosine (p-L-dl), administered either alone or in combination, optionally in a<br>

von Janta-Lipinski et al. ./. Med. ('hem., 1998, 41 (12), 2040-2046 disclose the use of the L-enantiorners of 3'-fluoro-modificd p-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates for the inhibition of hepatitis B polymerases. Specifically, the 5'-<br><br>
triphosphates of 3'-deoxy-3'-fluoro-p-L-thymidine (P-L-FTTP), 2\3'-dideoxy-3'-fluoro-p-L-cytidine (p-L-FdCTP), and 2',3'-dideoxy-3*-fluoro-p-L-5-methylcyiidine (p-L-FMethCTP) were disclosed as effective inhibitors of HBV DNA polymerases. In addition, von Janta-Lipinski et al. discloses the biological activity of the triphosphate of P-L-thymidine (but not p-L-2'-dC) as a nucleoside inhibitor of endogenous DNA polymerases of HBV and DHBV. However, only triphosphorylated P-L-thymidine was evaluated, not the claimed unphosphorylated form, and there is no comment in the article on whether those p-L-nucleosides are phosphorylated in cells or in vivo or, more importantly, there is no comment on the efficacy of phosphorylation of P-L-thymidine in vivo. Because of this, the article does not teach that P-L-thymidine would have any hepatitis B activity in a cell or in vivo. See also WO 96/1204.<br>

Nuclcosidc Synthesis<br>
Processes for preparing nucleosides and furanosyl intermediates are well known in the prior art. In 1952, Pratt et al. reported the synthesis of L-deoxythymidine (LdT) from arabinose (J.W. Pratt et al., J. Am Chem. Sac., 1952, 74:2200-2205,). The synthetic route disclosed by Pratt included the formation of a methyl glycoside from L-arabinose, with subsequent conversion to methylthio-thiocarbonate, and reduction to the deoxy-sugar. Alternatively, the 2-hydroxy group was converted to its corresponding mesylate group, which then was subjected to a reductive cleavage in order to provide the final LdT product (J.W. Pratt et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1952, 74:2200-2205; H. Urata et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1992, 20:3325-3332).<br>
Variations in the synthesis of LdT were made by Shull et al., Sznaidman et al., Wang et al., and Stick et al., each of whom converted L-arabinose to methyl 2'-deoxy-ribofuranoside via a glycal intermediate (B.K. Shull et al., J. Carbohydr. Chem., 1996, 75:955-64; M.L. Sznaidman et al., Nucleosides, Nucleotides &amp; Nucleic Acids, 2002, 277155-63~Z:X: Wang Qi'a\.^Nucleoxides\'Nucleondes &amp; Nucleic Acids, 2001, 20:11-40; and R.V.Stick et aL Aust. J. Ghent, 2002, 55:83-85).<br>
In 1969 Niedballa and Vorbruggen described a process for preparing P-nucleosides by coupling a silylated N-heterocyclic compound and, in particular a pyrimidine, with a 1-0-alkyl or preferably a 1-acyl-protected sugar such as a l-acyl-protected ribose, deoxyribose, arabinose or glucose. The reaction utilized a Friedel-Crafts reagent as a catalyst and proceeded at ambient temperatures (DE 1 919 307 to<br><br>
Sobering Aktiengesellschaft). The inventors noted that this process surprisingly provided the p-anomeric product almost exclusively, and would work for uracil and cytosine but not as well for thymidine (DE 1 919 307, Examples 1-10 and 12-15).<br>
In their exemplified species, Niedballa and Vorbruggen reported only 1-0-acetyl, 1-acetyl, and 1-0-methyl ribose, deoxyribose and arabinofuranose derivative compounds as starting reagents (DE 1191 307, Examples 1-16). Nowhere was a 1-halo sugar used. In fact, the inventors noted that use of a 1-halo sugar as a reactant was not favored based upon its instability (DE 1 191 307; .IP 63026183 to Sato et al.). In the single example where a cytosine base was reacted with a 2'-deoxyribose sugar, the starting compound was l-O-methyl-2-desoxy-3,5-di-toluylribose (DE 1 919 307, Example 7). It is not surprising that this reaction formed the p-anomer to the near exclusion of the a-anomer, because it is known that 3'-ester derivatives of ribose normally form the P-anomer in preference to the a-anomer product.<br>
In subsequent patents, Vorbruggen et al. referred to their earlier (1969) synthetic method as being "particularly disadvantageous", because the separation of the Lewis acid salts or Friedel-Crafts catalysts formed during the reaction resulted in the need for numerous, labor-intensive steps in the final work-up, and provided lower per cent yields of the final product (DE 2508312, British equivalent GB 1 542 442). In GB 1 542 442, the process replacement of Lewis acids by trimethylsilyl esters of mineral acids and starting reagents that were a 1-halo, 1-O-alkyl, or 1-Oacyl sugar, were reported. As before, all exemplified species utilized a 1-O-acetyl-p-D-ribofuranose starting reagent, and so, not surprisingly, produced the P-anomeric product to the near exclusion of the a-anomer(GB 1 542 442, Examples 1-13).<br>
Likewise, in U.S. 4,209,613, Vorbruggen disclosed a single step nucleoside synthesis that included reacting a silylated nucleoside base with a 1-0-acyl, 1-O-alkyl, or 1-halo derivative of a protected sugar in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst selected from any of a group of Lewis acids (U.S. 4,209,613). As before, all exemplified species utilized a 1-O-acetyl-p-D-ribofuranose starting reagent, and again, not surprisingly, produced the p-anomeric product to the near exclusion of the a-anomer (U.S. 4,209,613. Examples 1-16).<br><br>
In U.S. 5,750,676, Vorbruggen el al. reported a process that comprised reacting a free sugar with an N-heterocyclic base in the presence of a silylating agent and an inert solvent having a Lewis acid, wherein the improvement resided in the persilylation of the free sugar. No comment was made regarding product anomeric ratios, and no preference for a single Lewis acid was stated. However, the examples indicated that numerous preparatory steps were required in order to obtain the final products, a distinct disadvantage for industrial scalability (U.S. 5,750,676, Examples 1-3).<br>
Yet another process for preparing nucleosides reported by Vorbruggen et al. included a one-pot synthesis utilizing a trialkylsilyl ester of an inorganic or strong organic acid, especially a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, a nucleoside base, and a 1-0-acyl, 1-0-alkyl, or 1-halo derivative of a protected sugar derivative (U.S. 4,209,613).<br>
Chloro-Sugar Intermediate<br>
Chloro-sugur is an important intermediate in the formation of LdT, and numerous routes to its synthesis exist. Nonlimiting examples of syntheses for making chloro-sugars include the following,<br>
Isbell, Bock et al., and Lundt et al. each reported the synthesis of LdT from D-xylose in a process that involved a 1,4-lactone intermediate (H.S. Isbell, Methods in Carbohydrate Research, 1963, 2:13-14; K. Dock et al., Carbohydrate Research, 1981, 90:17-26' K. Bock et al., Carbohydrate Research, 1982, /04:79-85; and 1. Lundt and R. Madsen, Topics in Current Chemistry, 2001, 275:177-191).<br>
Bock et al. and Humphlett utilized D-galactose as a starting material, which was oxidatively cleaved and brominated to produce D-lyxonolactone. Subsequent steps of selective hydrolysis and transformations provided a chloro-sugar intermediate that could then be used to prepare LdT (K. Bock et al., Carbohydrate Research, 1981790:17-26; K. Bock et al.. Carbohydrate Research, 1979, (55:313-319; K. Bock et al., Acta Chem. Scand fi, 1984, 55:555-561; and W.J. Humphlett, Carbohydrate Research, 1967, 4:157-164).<br>
Bock ct al. also prepared LdT from D-gluconolactone by treating the latter with aqueous bromine and hydrazine, and then with excess aqueous potassium hydroxide to form a primary epoxide. Next, they effected a Payne rearrangement of the primary<br><br>
epoxide to a secondary epoxide on the lactone. and oxidatively cleaved the lactone to form a chloro-sugar intermediate, which then could be used to prepare LdT (K. Bock et al., Carbohydrate Research, 1979, 65:313-316; K. Bock et al., Ada Chem. Scand. B, 1984, 55:555-561). In the same journal articles referenced, Bock et al. disclosed the formation of a chloro-sugar from D-galactonolactone, and by the bromination of D-mannono-1,4- lactone.<br>
Liotta and Hager reported the synthesis of a chloro-sugar from a commercially available lactone in a synthesis that involved a stereoselective cyclization step, as well as a synthesis that utilized an aldehyde intermediate and the Horner-Emmons modification of the Wittig reaction (D.C. Liotta et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 33:7083-7086; and U.S. 5,414,078).<br>
Schinazi et al., Ravid et al,, and Tani&gt;'iichi et al. disclosed processes for preparing, chloro-sugar intermediates from hydroxy glulamic acid, which is cyclized to a ribonolactone derivative that can then be converted to a chloro-sugar (U.S. 6,348,587 Bl to R.F. Schinazi et al.; U. Ravid et al., Tetrahedron, 1978, 34:1449-1452; and M. Taniguchi et al., Tetrahedron, 1974, 30:3547-3552).<br>
Jung ct al. reported using a Sharplcss epoxidation on a commercially available alcohol to provide an epoxide that was then treated with alcohol to prepare a diol, which was then converted to an acetonide. The acetonide was acidified to give the desired ribofuranose, which was then converted to a chloro-sugar. Alternatively, an epoxy-alcohol was subjected to hydroboration using the Swern oxidation, and the cloro-sugar was formed from a di-toluoyl derivative (M.H. Jung et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1998. 39:4615-4618).<br>
Yadav et al. and Harada et al. disclosed syntheses that employed allyl bromide and ozonolysis, or 2-bromomethyl-[l,3]-dioxolane without ozonolysis, to prepare chloro-sugars (J.S. Yadav et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 2002, 43:3837-3839; T. Harada ef al.:, Chem. Lett., 1981, 1109-1110), while Ohuri et al., Cheng et al., and Abramski et a!. reported treating a glycal with acidic methanol to produce 2-deoxy-ribofuranose that could then be converted to the desired chloro-sugar.<br>
JP 09059292 to Takeya Mori disclosed a one-pot synthesis of a 4-aminopyrimidine nucleoside from a 4-hydroxypyrimidine nucleoside by protection of the<br><br>
reactant's hydroxy groups with trimethylsilyl groups, subsequent reaction with phosphorus oxychloride or 4-chlorophenyl phosphorodichloridate, and amination with aqueous ammonia.<br>
Chu reported a process for preparing 2'-deoxynucleosides thai included reacting a nucleoside having T- and .V-hydroxyl groups with a mixture of acyl bromide or acyl chloride and hydrobromic or hydrochloric acid at moderate temperatures to provide a haloacyl nucleoside derivative that was deprotected to form a desired nucleoside product (U.S. 5,200,514).<br>
In Nucleosides and Nudeotides, 1996, I5(l-3):749-769, Kamaike et al. disclosed the formation of 2'-deoxyribonucleosides via nucleophilic substitution reactions of 4-azolyl-l-p-D-ribofuranosyl-pyrimidin-2(l//)-one converted from uridine with [15N]phthalimide in the presence of triethylamine or DBU to give A^-phthaloyl[4-15N]cytidine in high yields.<br>
JP 71021872 to Sankyo Co. Ltd. taught the reaction of a silylated cytosine, uracil, thymine or azauracil base with a sugar halide, such as a halogenized ribose or glucose, in the presence of a solvent and mercuric halide.<br>
D-Xylose<br>
Utilizing D-xylose as a starting material, 2'-deoxynucleosides can be synthesized according to methods taught in the prior art.<br>
Okabe et al. disclosed a synthesis of 2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-p-toluoyl-a-L-eryihro-pentofuranosyl chloride, which may be further reacted to produce P-L-2'-deoxythymidine (LdT) (Okabe et al., J. Org. Chem., 1991, 56^^:4392; Bock et al., Carbohydr. Res., 1981, 90:17-26; Bock et al., Carbohydr. Res., 1982,104:19-85).<br>
The following is a non-limiting list of processes used to prepare intermediates in the synthesis of 2'-deoxynucleosides and 2'-deoxythymidine in particular, from D-xylose.<br>
Takahata et al. and Graf et al. reported the formation of 2,5-dibromo-2,5-dideoxy-D-lyxo-l,4-lactone by reaction of the lyxo-l,4-lactone with potassium iodide in<br><br>
acetone (Takahata et al., J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59:7201-7208; Graf et al., Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1993, 1091-1098).<br>
Lundt et al., Bock et al., and Choi et al. disclosed the inversion of 5-bromo-2,5-dideoxy-D-threo-pentono-I.4-luctone to lorni 2-deoxy-L-ribono-l,4-lactone (Lundt et al., Topics in Current Chemistry, 2001, 275:177-191; Bock et al., Carbohydr. Res., 1981, 90:17-26; WO 01/72698 to Y-R.Choi et al.).<br>
Urata et al. and Zhang et al. reported the conversion of 2-deoxy-3,5-di-0-toluoy!-a,p-L-ribose to 2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-para-toiuoyl-a-L-erythro-pentoruranosyl chloride either directly from lactol by reaction with hydrochloric and acetic acids, or indirectly via a 2-deoxy-7-methoxy-3,5-di-0-toluoyl-a,p1-L-ribose intermediate by reaction with acetic and hydrochloric acids (H. Urata et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1992, 20(/3;:3325-3332; Zhang et al., Nucleosides andNuclcotides, 1999,I8(1J-12):2351.<br>
Urata et al. also disclosed the preparation of 2'-deoxy-3',5'-di-O-/?
2,2'-Anhydro-l-Furanosyl Nucleoside Intermediate<br>
2'-Deoxy- and 2'-substituted nucleosides, and particularly 2'-deoxy- or 2'-substituted nucleosides that have pyrimidine bases, have been shown to stabilize oligonucleotides against nuclease degradation. Nuclease degradation is a problem in the field of oligonucleotide therapeutics (Huryn ct al., (1992), Chem. Rev. 92:1745-88; English et al., (1991), Angew. Chem. 30:613-722). However, to date, modification of pyrimidine nucleosides at the 2"-position has been accomplished only under harsh "conditions and by "syntheses that are'inefficient with generally low product yields (Verheyden et al., (1971), J. Ore. Chem, 36:250-254).<br>
Tronchet et al. disclosed a reduction of the oxirne derivative of 2'-ketouridine by BHb that provides predominantly 2'-hydroxy- or 2'-amino-nucleosides in the arabino-configuration (Tronchet et al., (1990), Tetrahedron Lett. 31:351). This work by Tronchet is one of only a few attempts at stereo-selective synthesis of 2'-ribofuranosyl-amino or 2'-ribofuranosyl-hydroxyl pyrimidincs.<br><br>
Early approaches at syntheses of 2'-deoxy- or 2:-substituted pyrimidine nucleosides focused on appropriate protective groups for ribose, xylose and arabinose that were the starting reagents in the syntheses. For example, numerous approaches to the synthesis of peracylated ribofuranose as an intermediate in processes for preparing nucleosides were attempted. These included i) a 7-step stereospecific process that started with D-ribose and provided |3-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl thymidine in an approximate 40% final product yield (M. Jung and V. Xu, Tetrahedron Lett. (1997), 38:4199); ii) a ?&gt;-step process starting from L-ribose and resulting in a 56% product yield (F.F. Recondo and H. Rinderknecht, Helv. Chirn^Acta, (1959) 42:1171; iii) an 8-step process utilizing L-arabinose as a starting material and providing about a 20% product yield (J. Du et al., Nucleosides and Nucleotides, (1999). 18:187; iv) a 6-step process starting with L-xylose (% yield of final product unknown) (E. Moyroud and P. Strazewski, Tetrahedron (1999) 55:1277; and v) a multi-step process beginning with D-ribose that initially was converted to tri-O-acetyl thymidine (U.S. Patent No. 4, 914, 233).<br>
In 1959, E.F. Recondo reported a 5-step process for preparing toluoyl-, benzoyl-and acetyl-protected ribofuranosyl in an approximate 70-80% yield from D-ribose (E.F. Recondo, Helv. Chim. Acta, (1959) 121:1171). Codington, Doerr and Fox disclosed the synthesis of 2,2'-anhydro-l-(5-O~trity]-p-D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine from p-D-thymidine by reacting |i-D-thymidine with tritylchloride and pyridine for 24 hours at room temperature, and then at about 70 °C. for 3 hours, to protect the 5'-OH on P-D-thymidine; then reacting 5'-protected (3-D-thymidine with tosyl chloride (TsCl) and pyridine at 0 °C, which provides a tosyl-protected 2'-group; and finally reacting the 5'-trityl-O-protected, 2'-tosyl-0-protected- (3-D-thymidine with sodium benzoate (NaOBz) and acetamide at 100 "C for 1 hour to provide 2,2'-anhydro-l-(5'-6&gt;-tntyl- (M)-arabinofuranosyl)thym!!ie in 61% yield (Codington et al., J. Ore. _Che.m.. (1963) 29:558-64).<br>
Enzymatic synthesis of p-D-thymidine was reported using E.coli and hypoxanthine in a first step, and reacting the resulting 2-mono-phosphorylated ribofuranosyl compound with uridine phosphorylase and recovering the desired P-D-thymidine product in 45% yield by column chromatography (A. I. Zinchenko, Khimiya Prirodnvkh Soedinenii, (1989), 4:587-88).<br><br>
Another approach to nucleoside synthesis involved formation of a 5-methyl-2,2'-anhydrouridine intermediate from an "open nucleoside". The open nucleoside is formed by an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement reaction that provides 2,2'-anhydro-l-(p-D-arabino-furanosyl)nucleoside from the ring opening of 2,2'-anhydronucleoside. Synthesis of anhydronucleosides was described in Japanese Kokai No. 81 49 398 (laid open on 2 May 1981), which required as an intermediate, an acylated iminoarabino[l\ 2':4,5] oxazoline acid addition salt. The use of an available amino-oxazolinc carbohydrate derivative as an anhydronucleoside precursor was reported in 1971 (J. Mol. L (1970) 47:537).<br>
Rao et al. reported a 6-step synthesis that utilized D-xylose as a starting reagent to form 1-p-D-xylofuranosyl-thymine, which then was treated with PhOCOOPh (diphenylcarbonate) and NaHCOj catalyst in the presence of DMF at 140-150 °C for about 4 hours to provide 2,2'-anhydro-l-(p-arabinofuranosyi)thymine in 55% yield (A.V. Rama Rao et al., J. Chem. Soc. Comm., (1994), p. 1255; EP 0 683 171 Bl). Both Schinazi et al. and Manfredi et al. disclosed a synthesis similar to that of Rao et al. that employed the same reagents except for utilizing 1-p-D-arabinofurnnosyl thymine rather than 1-p-D-xylofuranosyl thymine (Schinazi et al., LMed._Chern,., (1979) 22:1273: Manfredi et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letters, (2001) 11:1 329-32).<br>
An early attempt at formation of 3', 5'-dibenzoyl protected 2,2'-anhydro-l-(p-ribonofuranosyl)thymine was taught by Anton Holy et al. Holy et al. used P-D-ribonofuranosyl-thymine as a starting compound, reacted it with 1 .4 eq. of PhOCOOPh and NaHCOa catalyst in HMPA for approximately 20 minutes at about 150 °C to form 2,2'-anhydro-l-(p-D-ribofuranosyl (thymine (5-methyiuridine). which was reacted with PhCOCN in DMF to protect the 3'- and 5 '-OH groups by forming 2,2'-anhydro-l-(p-3',5'-diO-benzoyl)ribofuranosyl thymine in approximately 87% yield (A. Holy et al., -Collect- Czechr Commun.. (1974), -39:3157-67)- --Holy-el al. also reported the unsuccessful attempt to convert 2-amino-p-D-arabinofurano-|T, 2':4,5]-2-oxazoline into O2, 2'-anhydro-l-(p-D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine (Id. at 1377).<br>
Fraser et al. improved upon Holy's process by using the same starting reagent and reacting it with 1 .2 eq. of PhOCOOPh and NaHCOs catalyst in the presence of HMPA at about 150 °C for about 2 hours to provide 2,2'-anhydro-l-p-D-ribofuranosyl thymine. However, the process of Fraser et al. produced a decreased percent yield of<br><br>
product of about 77% as compared to about 87% yield given in the Holy et al. synthesis (Allister Fraser et al, J. Heterocycl. Chem.. (1993) 30(5): 1277-88).<br>
Yukio Aoyania et al. disclosed formation of a silyl-protecting ring that embraces both the 3'- and 5'-positions on (•5-l-D-(2-Br-ribofuranosyl) thymine in about 96% yield (Aoyama et al., Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, (1996), 15(l-3):733-8). 1-p-D-ribofuranosyl-thymine was used as a starting material and was reacted with TPDSClj and pyridine at room temperature to provide the 3'-, 5'-silyI- protected ring structure. Next the silyl-protected structure was reacted with TfCl and DMAP in CHiC^ at room temperature to form the 2,2'-anhydro intermediate, and finally reacting the 2,2'-anhydro intermediate with LiBr, BFj-OIvi in 1,4-dioxane al about 60 °C to afford the final product, 1 -(3-D-2'-Br, 3',5'-tri-O-di-(dimethyl)silyl)-ribofuranosyl-thymine.<br>
Mitsui Chemicals, Inc., reported methods for preparing 2,2'-anhydro-l-([3-L-arabinofuranosyl)thymine and 2,2'-anhydro-5,6-dihydrocyclouridine, which are useful as intermediates in the synthesis of 1.-nucleic acids (PCT Publication No. WO 02/044104; EP 1 348 712 Al). The 7-step Mitsui process includes: a) reacting L-arabinose with cyanamide to provide L-arabino-amino-oxazoline; b) reacting L-arabinoaminooxazoline with an acrylic acid derivative to form a derivative of the L-arabinoaminooxazoline having a methyl acrylic acid ester bound to the N-atom of the oxazoline moiety; c) reacting the product of the (b) with a base such as, for example, an alkali metal, alkali metal alkoxide, alkali rnetal carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate, alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal hydride, organic base, base ion exchange resin, and the like, any of which thereby form a tricyclic ring that is an L-2,2'-anhydro-nucleic acid derivative; d) isomerizing the L-2,2'-anhydro-nucleic acid derivative from step (c) to provide 2,2'-anhydro-1-( (3-L-arabinofuranosyl)thymine; e) subjecting the 2,2'-anhydro-l-( (3-L-arabinofuranosyl)thymine from step (d) either to halogenation and subsequent protection. or to protection and subsequent halogenation, or to simultaneous halogenation and protection, to form a 2'-position halogenated L-thymidine derivative; f) dehalogcnating. the halogenated L-thymidine derivative from step (e); and g) deblocking the 3'- and 5'-positions of the product from step (i) to provide L-thymidine. While Mitsui reported good product yields from this synthesis, it is desireable to have a process that requires fewer steps so that it is more easily adapted to large scale production for industry.<br><br>
A second, closely related process found in the prior art is that reported by Pfizer in EP 0 351 126 Bl. Pfizer's process included a new route to the formation of O2, 2'-anhydro-l-(p-D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine nucleosides (anhydronucleosides), which can easily be converted to p-thymine derivatives. The process includes a condensation reaction between 2-amino- p-D-arabinofurano[T,2':4,5]-2-oxazoline, or a 5'-trityl- or silyl-protected form thereof, preferably with methyl-2-formylpropionate in H20 and NaOH at pH 8.1 for 48 hours at room temperature, followed by treatment with aqueous acid to afford the O',2'-anhydro-l-(p-D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine in approximately 42% yield. Alternatives to using methyl-2-formylpropionate include the use of methyl-3-bromomethylacrylate in the presence of DMAP and EtsN at about 80 °C for 4 days, which provided an approximate 25% yield of final anhydro-thymidine product; the use of ethyl-2-formylpropionate in aqueous MeOH and Et^N at room temperature for about 24 hours and then at about 60 "C for another 24 hours for an approximate 8% yield of the anhydro-thymidine product; and the use of snethyl-3-methoxymethacrylate in DMSO at about 80 °C for 4 days to provide the anhydro-thymidine product in approximately 32% yield.<br>
The Pfizer condensation reaction includes the use of basic catalysts in its preferred embodiment. Such catalysts are tertiary amines and inorganic salts, and preferred among these are dimclhylaminopyridine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, and combinations thereof. Pfizer reported that its preferred method for converting 02,2'-anhydro-l-(p-D-arabinofuranosyl)thymine to p-thymidine was by reaction of the anhydrothymidine with HBr, followed by the removal of Br by reaction with BaSCV poisoned Pd catalyst. It is desireable to have an industrially-scalable synthesis that would eliminate the need for using a poisoned catalyst of this type.<br>
Boehringer-Ingeilieim Pharma (iMBH reported a 4-step process for preparing ji--t-2--deoxythymtdine-that used -L-arabinose as a starting-material (PCT Publication No. WO 03/087118). The process comprised a) reacting L-arabinose with cyanamide in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution, or in another polar solvent such as, for example, DMF, pyridine, or N-methyl-pyrrolidine, at a temperature of from 80-100 °C, in the presence of a base catalyst such as NH\ Et;tN. or tri-ethyl carbonate, alkali carbonate, or di-alkali carbonate, to form an L-arabinofuranosyl-amino-oxazoline derivative; b) reacting the L-arabinofuranosyl-amino-oxazoline derivative from step (a) with a 2-<br><br>
methyl-C-3-acid, or an activated derivative thereof, in inert solvent under water-precipitating conditions such as, for example, in the presence of DMF, DMSO, NMP, acetone, benzene, toluene, or cyclohexane, and a tertiary amine base or inorganic salt catalyst like DMAP, Et3N, or N-methyl-morpholine at about 20-80 °C; c) reacting the [}-L-2,2'-anhydrothymidine from step (b) with a nucleophilic reagent such as an acidic-halogen like HC1, HI, or HBr, toluene sulIonic acids or thioacetic acid, in DMF or trifluoroacetic acid solvent, to rupture the C-O bond at the 2'-position; and d) reacting the p-L-2'-halo-thymidine with a catalyst, preferably either Pd or Raney-Nickel, to remove the halo group from the 2'-position and to provide (3-L-thymidine as a final product.<br>
Preferably, prior to performing steps (a) or (b) of the synthesis, any free hydroxyl groups are protected to prevent their reaction with the amino-oxazoline derivative, or with the 2-methyl-C-3-acid.<br>
In this Boehringer synthesis, preferred protective groups include benzyl, diphenyl-methyl, triphenylinethyl, or silyl, where the ihree substituents on silyl may be Ci-a alkyl or phenyl, and the phenyl groups optionally may be further substituted. Any protective groups can be removed as a final step in the synthesis, and crystallization or purification steps may also be added.<br>
Unfortunately, the first step in the process disclosed by Boehringer required a minimum of two extraction, filtration, and crystallization steps; the second step in the process required the use of boiling cyclohexane, and final purification by chromatography; and the fourth step in the process required the use of a Pd or Rancy-Nickel catalyst. The reported yield of the p-L-2,2'-anhydroarabinofuranosyl-thymine intermediate was approximately 49%. Thus, there exists a need for a synthetic method that avoids the use of a Pd or Raney-Nickel catalyst and that provides hieher percent yields of the 2,2'-anhydro-thymidine intermediate.<br>
Holy and Pragnacharyulu et al. disclosed the use of L-arabinose as a starting material that is reacted with cyanamide to produce a 1,2-oxazoline derivative; the oxazolidine derivative is reacted with propionic acid ethyl ester to provide an O2'2 -anhydro-L~thymidine intermediate that is benzoylated and reductively cleaved or treated<br><br>
with hydrogen chloride to provide the desired chloro-sugar. (A. Holy, Coll.  Czech. Chem. Commun. 1972,57,4072-4087).<br>
Abushanab et al. reported a chloro-sugar synthesis that includes reacting a methyl-oxirane carboxylic aeid ester with an oxazoline to provide 0~~ -anhydro-L-thymidine intermediate (E. Abushanab, and P. V. P Pragnacharyula, U.S. Patent 5,760,208, June 2, 1998), while Asakura et al., Hirota et al. and A. Holy disclosed the reaction of ethyl propiolate with oxazoline to provide O2'2 -anhydro-L-uridine, which is then protected at its 3' and 5' positions and reacted with hydrogen chloride to produce 2'-deoxy-2'-chloro sugar as an intermediate (J.-l. Asakura, and M. J. Robins, ./. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 4928-4933; J.-l. Asakura, and M. J. Robins, Tetrahedron Lett. 1988, 29, 2855-2858; K. Hirota, Y. Kitade, Y. Kanbe, Y. Isobe, and Y. Maki, Synthesis, 1993, 2/0, 213-215; and A. Holy, Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1972, 57, 4072-4087).<br>
In 2003, Abushanab and Pragnacharyulu reported a process for preparing pyrimidine nucleosides thai involved a Michael-type condensation reaction between an arabinoribofuranosyl-amino-oxazoline and a substituted cpoxy-methylate derivative; subsequent acylation of the condensed product by treatment with pivaioyl chloride to place a chloro group at the 2"-position of the thymidine; and finally, dehalogenation to remove the chloro substituent if a 2'-deoxy-thymidine was the desired product (U.S. Patent No. 6,596,859).<br>
However, pivaioyl chloride is known to cause anhydro-ring opening, and its placement of a chloro group at the 2'-position on thymidine then requires an additional synthetic step to remove the chloro group. Also, it would be advantageous to avoid the use of the costly reagent methyl-2-methyl glycidate that Abushanab and Pragnacharyulu employ in the condensation reaction of their method, as well as the use of acetonitrile used in the second step of the process, and the chromatographic separations required for each step in the synthesis.<br>
Pragnacharyulu et al. also reported the formation of a 2,2'-anhydro-amino-oxazoline from L-arabinose by reacting L-arabinose with HiNCN, which permitted an intramolecular elimination of one terminal OH and one H to afford a 2,2'-anhydro-amino-oxazoline product intermediate (Pragnacharyulu et al., (1995), J. Pro. Chen]. 60:3096-99).<br><br>
Sawai et al. disclosed a direct cyclization step in the formation of 2,2'-anhydro-(arabino-furanosyl)thymine from D-arabinose. Their synthesis comprised (1) preparing D-arabino-furanosyl-amino-oxazoline from D-arabinose by methods known in the art; (2) reacting the D-arabino-furanosyl-amino-oxazoline with ethyl-a-(bromo-methyl)-acrylate in dimethyl acetamide to provide an oxazolino-N-branched intermediate in approximately an 88% yield; and (3) reacting the intermediate formed in step (2) with KO'Bu and /-BuOH to afford 2,2'-anhydro-(arabinofuranosyl)thymine in about a 30% yield, or alternatively, using hydrogen iodide to open the O2'2 -anhydro-L-thymidine linkage, and then reacting the acyclic product with potassium iodide to produce di-0-benzoyl-2'-deoxythyrnidine (Sawai et al., (1994), Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 13(6-7): 1647-54; Sawai et al., Chem. Lett,, 1994, 605-606). This process advantageously avoids the use of catalysts like poisoned Pd/BaSOa, but results in rather low % yields of products.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,914,233 to Freskos et al. disclosed the selective separation of p-thymidine from a mixture of a- and p-anomers by a 5-step process involving formation of tri-0-acyl-p-ribothymidine, and conversion of 2,2'-anhydro-f3-thymidine to 2'-halo-2'-deoxy-5-methyluridine followed by conversion of the latter to p-thymidine.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,212.293 to Green et al., reported the synthesis of 2'.,V-dideoxynucleosides by reacting a protected anhydrothyrnidine with a halo-generating agent that contained an organo-aluminum compound for increased reactant solubility.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,596,087 to Alia et al. included the formation of 2,2'-anhydrothymidine that was brominated and then reduced by methods known to those skilled in the art, to produce P-thymidine.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,360,040 to Acevedo et al. disclosed a 3\51-protectcd -2.2'-anhydro-uridine to synthesize corresponding arabinosides.<br>
McGee and Murtiashaw each reported preparing a chloro-sugar intermediate from L-arabinose as a starting material that includes an O2'2 -anhydro-L-thymidine intermediate prepared from different reagent compounds than were used by Holy or Pragnacharyulu et al. (D. McGee, Boehringer Ingelheim Proposal to Novirio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., May 17, 2002; C. W. Murtiashaw, Eur. Patent, 0,351,126 Bl, January 18,1995).<br><br>
McGee et al. disclosed a method lor preparing 21-modified nucleosides by an intramolecular displacement reaction (U.S. Patent No. 6, 090, 932). McGee et al. reported the introduction of a substituent at the 2'-position of a 2,2'-anhydro-uridine by the careful selection of a 3'-substituent that could be activated to cause stereospecific reduction at the 2'-position. The synthesis comprised protecting the 5'-OH of uridinc by reaction with DMT to form 5'-0-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)uridine, and afforded the final product, 2'-dcoxythymidine. in approximately 24% yield.<br>
Even though McGee et al. reported that their process could be scaled for industrial purposes, it is known that dioxane is flammable and prone to peroxide formation, and is therefore contraindicated for industrial processes. In addition, McGee et al. is silent with respect to whether their process produced the D- or L-enantiomer of 2'-deoxythymidine, or whether separation of enantiomers was required.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for a simple, cost-effective, and safe process for making 2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, analogs and prodrugs thereof, including P-L-2'-deoxynucleosides, such as p-L-2'-deoxythymidine, that avoids the use of hazardous, toxic, dangerous, and/or difficult to handle reagents that do not lend themselves to industrial production.<br>
There is also a need to provide a synthesis for preparing 2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, analogs and prodrugs thereof, including p-L-2'-deoxynucleosides, such as p-L-2'-deoxythymidine, that utili/.es safe materials and reagents.<br>
There is also a need to provide a synthesis for preparing 2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, analogs and prodrugs thereof, including p-L-2'-deoxynucleosides, such as P-L-2"-deoxythymidine, under mild reaction conditions.<br>
There is also a need to provide an efficient and cost-effective procedure for synthesizing 2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, analogs and prodrugs thereof, including P-L-2'-deoxynucleosides, such as p-L-2'-deoxythymidine, under mild reaction conditions.<br>
There is also a need to provide a synthesis that is efficient by requiring a minimal number of steps.<br>
There is also a need to provide a process that requires few or no steps for product separation.<br><br>
There is also a need to provide an industrially scalable process for the synthesis of 2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, analogs and prodrugs thereof, including P-L-21-deoxynucleosides, such as p-L-2'-deoxythymidine, that is cost-effective and affords the final product in high yield.<br>
There is also a need to provide an industrially-scalable synthesis for fJ-2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, analogs and prodrugs thereof, including P-L-2'-deoxynucleosides, such as p-L-2'-deoxythymidine, that produces the p-anomeric form of the desired compound in excess of the u-anomeric form in good yields.<br>
There is also a need to provide a synthesis for amino-acid prodrugs of 2'-deoxynucleosides, salts, and analogs thereof, including p-L-2'-deoxynucleosides, such as p-L-2'-deoxythymidine.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses novel, efficient synthetic processes for preparing 2'-, 3'- and/or 5'-substituted-nucleosides and 2'-, 3'- and/or 5'-deoxy-nucleosides, such as 2'-substituted and 2'-deoxy-nucleosides derived from natural and non-natural carbocyclic, heterocyclic and heteroaromatic nucleoside bases, and, in particular, p-L-2'-deoxy-thymidine (LdT) and salts, prodrugs, stereroisomers and enantiomers thereof.

In still another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for preparing 2'-deoxythymidine from D-xylose that includes 2-deoxy-3,5-di-0-/?ara-toluoyl-a-L-erythro-pentofuranosyl chloride as a key intermediate.<br>

Another representative process of the present invention includes using a reducing agent, such as Red-Al, in combination with a sequestering agent, such as 15-crown-5 ether, to rupture a 2,2'-anhydro-l~ruiai)osyl-nuclcoside ring intermediate to produce the desired nucleoside product.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses novel, efficient synthetic processes for preparing 2'-, 3'- and/or 5'-substituted-nucleosides and 2:-, 3'- and/or 5'-deoxy-nucleosides, such as 2'-substituted and 2'-deoxy-nucleosides derived from natural and non-natural carbocyclic, heterocyclic and heteroaromatic nucleoside bases, and, in particular, fi-L-2'-deoxy-th&gt;Tnidine (LdT) and salts, prodrugs, stereroisomers and enantiomers thereof. Included herewith are processes for the production of the stereoisomeric, diastereoisomeric, and enantiomcric forms of the compounds of the present invention, based on the appropriate starting materials. The compounds made according to the present invention may be used as intermediates in the preparation of a wide variety of other nucleoside analogues, or may be used directly as antiviral and/or antineoplastic agents.<br>
In one- embodiment, the ."-deox\-nucleosides and 2'-suhstitii1ed nucleosides have naturally-occurring pyrimidine nucleoside bases. In a particular embodiment, the process is directed to the synthesis of p-L-2'-deoxythymidine (LdT). In another embodiment, the 2'-deoxy-nucleosides and 2'-substituted nucleosides have non-naturally occurring pyrimidine-like nucleoside bases. In one particular embodiment, the non-naturally occurring pyrimidine-like nucleoside base can be prepared by a synthetic process disclosed in the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the process of the present invention requires no separation of isomers, and therefore is an improvement over the prior art.<br>
In one embodiment, the introduction of functionalities at the 2'-position or elimination of such functionalities to give a 2'-deoxy nucleoside is accomplished by selective reactions that utilize D-xylose. L-arabinose, L-ribose, D-galactose, D-gluconolactone, D-galactonolactone, D-glucose, D-hydroxy-glutamic acid (for ribonolactone), alcohol or epoxyalcohol, isopropylidene glyceraldehydes, or substituted dioxolane as a starting reagent.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the invention, the syntheses proceed via a chloro-sugar intermediate. Therefore, one particular intermediate of the synthetic<br><br>
processes set forth herein, which does not involve intramolecular rearrangements, is a chloro-sugar compound.<br>
In another particular embodiment of the invention, the syntheses proceed via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement. Therefore, one particular intermediate of the synthetic processes set forth herein is a 2,2'-anhydro-l-furanosyl nucleoside ring.<br>
In a first embodiment. 2"-deo\ylhymidine is prepared from D-xylose as a starting material (Figure 4). This synthesis comprises: (a) oxidizing D-xylose first with an aqueous solution of bromine, and then with acetic and hydrobromic acid to form 2,5-dibromo-2,5-dideoxy-D-lyxono-l,4-lactone (2); (b) reacting the lactone product from step (a) with potassium iodide in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), to provide the corresponding 5-iodo compound with selective removal of the bromine atom at C-2 to give 5-iodo-2-deoxylactone (3): (c) subjecting the 5-iodo-2-deoxylactone to aqueous potassium hydroxide to provide the 4,5-epoxide derivative (4); (d) treating the 4,5-epoxide derivative with an aqueous acid to produce the corresponding 2-deoxy-L-ribonolactone via a stereospecific inversion at C-4 (5); (e) protecting the C-3 and C-5 positions by reaction with any protecting group, such as toluoyl chloride in TEA (6); (f) selectively reducing the protected 2-deoxy-L-ribonolactone with Red-Al reducing agent to give the corresponding lactol (7); and (g) converting the lactol from step (f) to the desired chloro sugar intermediate (9).<br>
In a second embodiment, an alternative synthesis for preparing 2'-deoxythymidine is provided that also utilizes D-xylose as a starting material using alternative reagents and advantageously eliminates three chromatographic purifications that involve highly polar, water soluble, UV-inactive reagents (Figure 23). The process comprises: (a) oxidizing D-xylose first with bromine/water and potassium carbonate to provide D-lyxono-l,4-lactone (2); (b) reacting the lactone of step (a) with acetic and hydrobromic acid, for example at 45 °C for 1 hour and then at room temperature with stirring for about 1.5 hours, to provide 2,5-dibrorno-2,5-dideoxy-D-lyxono-l,4-lactone (3); (c) reacting the lactone of step (b) with isopropyl acetate and sodium iodide in TFA, and, for example heating the reaction mixture to about 85 °C. for about 1.5 hours, to form 5-brorno-2,5-dideoxy-D-threo-pentono-l,4-laclone (4); (d) reacting the lactone from step (c) with potassium hydroxide and water and, for example, after 3 hours, heating the reaction mixture to about 80 °C for 30 minutes, then cooling the mixture to<br><br>
room temperature with stirring overnight, to provide 2-deoxy-L-ribono-l,4-lactone (5); (e) adding toluoyl protecting groups to C-3 and C-5 by reacting the lactone of step (d) with para-ioluoyl chloride, for example with pyridine in DME, (6); (f) reacting the 2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-/?a/-tf-toluoyl-L-ribono-l,4-laetone with D1BAL and, for example DM1: at approximately -60 °C for about 1 hour, to provide 2-deoxy-3,5-di-O- /wra-toluoyl-L-ribose (7); (g) reacting the product of step (f) with dry HC1 gas in acetic acid to prepare 2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-pa/Y/-toluoyl-a-I..-erytliro-pentofuranosyl chloride (8), which can then be reacted by means known to those of skill in the art to provide 2'-deoxythymidine as the final, desired product.<br>
In certain embodiments, L-arabinose is used as a starting material for the preparation of 2'-deoxynucleosides and 2'-deoxythymidine in particular. These processes include the steps of (a) converting L-arabinose to its corresponding methyl glycoside, thereby protecting the C-3 and C-4 hydroxyl groups as acetonide derivatives (2), (b) deoxygenating the C-2 hydroxyl group by converting it to the corresponding mesylate group (3), and then (c) subjecting the mesylate intermediate to reductive cleavage (5) with an additional two process steps to afford the key chlorosugar intermediate (Figure 1).<br>
Alternatively. L-arabinose may be converted to its corresponding glycal derivative via a reductive elimination step, see for example Figures 2 and 3, steps (1) and (2) respectively, and the resulting glycal intermediate may then be converted to methyl 2-deoxy-ribofuranoside, steps (4) and (5) respectively.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, L-arabinose is utilized as a starting material. Such processes include the steps of (a) reacting L-arabinose with cyanamide to afford a 1,2-oxazoline intermediate (1), (b) reacting the intermediate of step (a) with a 3-oxo-propionic acid ester derivative or ethyl propiolate to provide a 2,2'-anhydro-1-iuranosyl nucleoside ring (2), and (c) rupturing the ring of step (b) using various reactants and under different reaction conditions to provide LdT (Figures 16-22).<br>
Alternatively, 2'-deoxynucleosides also may be formed from galactose as a starting material. When D-galactose is utilized as the starting material, it is oxidatively cleaved and brominated to provide 2,5-dibromo-2,5-dideoxy-D-lyxono-l,4-lactone, and<br><br>
this lactone undergoes selective hydrogenolysis to afford 5-bromo-2-deoxylactone that undergoes a sequence of transformations to provide the key chlorosugar intermediate (Figure 5).<br>
Likewise, gluconolactones may serve as starting materials for the synthesis of 2'-deoxynucleotides. Gluconolactone is converted to 2,6-dibromo-2,6~dideoxy-D-mannono-l,4-lactone (1), successively treated with hydrazine and aqueous potassium hydroxide, acidified to cause inversion at C-4 and C-5 that affords a 2-deoxy-lactone (6), subjected to a Payne rearrangement of the epoxide (5), oxidatively cleaved and reduced to provide a lactone (7) that easily can be converted to the desired chlorosugar (11) (Figure 6).<br>
Alternatively, 2'-deoxynudeosides also may be formed from galactonolactones as a starting material. Where galactonolactone is utilized as the starting material, it is converted to the acetylated dibrotnolactone (2), treated with hydrazine and brommated to provide 2-deoxylactone (3), which is then de-acetylated, oxidatively cleaved and reduced by NaBH.4 to provide 2-deoxy-L-ribono-1.4-lactone (5), and this lactone is protected by reaction with toluoyl chloride, subjected to reduction by Red-Al and chlorination to afford the final, desired chlorosugar product (9) (Figure 7).<br>
The present invention also provides additional processes for preparing 2'-deoxynucleosides and 2'-deoxythymidine in particular, from starting materials that are non-carbohydrates (Figure 8), dioxolanyl derivatives (Figure 14), acids, esters and aldehydes (Figures 9, 10, 13), glycal (Figure 15), and alcohols (Figures 11 and 12). Details of these syntheses may be found in the Examples contained herein, which are the preferred embodiments (see Figures 1-23).<br>
Processes also are provided for using a reducing agent, such as Red-Al, in combination with a sequestering agent, such as 15-crown-5 ether, to rupture a 2,2'-anhydro-1-furanosyl-niicleoside ring intermediate to produce the desired 2'-deoxy nucleoside product. Alternatively, processes are provided for using a reducing agent, such as Red-Al, in the absence of a sequestering agent, to rupture a 2,2'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside ring intermediate to produce the desired 2'-deoxy nucleoside product. Alternatively, a 2,3'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside ring intermediate can be used to form the corresponding 3'-deoxy nucleoside.<br><br>
Any reducing agents known in the art which provide the necessary chemoselective and regioselective reduction may be used. Suitable reducing agents include Red-Al, Red-Al (sodium bis[2-methoxyethoxy]-aluminum hydride), NaHTe, Smh, H2 + Pd-phosphine catalyst, and LiAKO'Bu^H (lithium tri-tertiary butyoxy aluminum hydride),<br>
The ring-opening reaction can be carried out at any temperature that achieves the desired results, i.e., that is suitable for the reaction to proceed at an acceptable rate without promoting decomposition or excessive side products, preferably at reduced temperatures, such as from about 0-5 °C.<br>
Any reaction solvent can be selected that can achieve the necessary temperature and that can solubilize the reaction components. Non-limiting examples are any polar aprotic solvent including, but not limiting to, dichloromethane (DCM) or dichloroethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, dithianes. Till-, 1,2-dimethoxyethanc (OMK), dioxnne, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, pyridine, dimethylibrmamide (DMF), dimethylsulibxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide, or any combination thereof, though preferably THF and/or DME.<br>
Alternatively, processes are provided for using an appropriate nucleophilic agent, e.g. an organometallic agent (e.g. a Grignard reagent or an alkyl lithium reagent) if an alky! substituent is desired, to open the 2,2'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside ring intermediate to produce the desired 2'-substituted nucleoside product. In another embodiment, a 2.3'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside ring intermediate or 2,5'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nuclcosidc ring intermediate may be used to form the desired 3'-substituted or 5'-substituted nucleoside product.<br>
Specifically, in one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a process for preparing a 2'-deoxynucleoside or 2'-modified nucleoside that comprises (a) optionally protecting one or more hydroxyl groups on a furanosyl ring, such as a ribo-, arabino-, or xylo-furanosyl ring, by reaction with a protecting group (2); (b) condensing the optionally protected furanosyl ring from step (a) with an optionally substituted natural or non-natural nucleoside base to form a nucleoside (3); (c) reacting the nucleoside from step (b) vvith a condensing agent at an elevated temperature to afford a 2,21-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside (5); (d) reacting the 2,2'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside from step<br><br>

The 2,2'-anhydro-]-furanosyl-nucleoside can be purchased or synthesized by any means known in the art, including from furanyl sugars with a 2'-hydroxyl using standard sugar coupling techniques followed by condensation to form the 2,2'-anhydro compound, or alternatively, coupling the sugar with a cyanamide to obtain an oxazoline intermediate, then building the base with requisite cyclization or condensation agent.<br>
In particular embodiments of the present invention, the. (3- or a, D- or L-, 2'-deoxy or 2'-substituted nucleoside are prepared via the 2,2'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside according to the following protocols.<br>
From Arahino-Furanosc<br>
In one process of the present invention, a furanose, such as an L-furanose, and in particular L-arabinose, can be used as the starting material to prepare the 2,2'-anhydro-l-fiiranosyl-nucleoside, which is then reduced according to the present invention to give a 2'-deoxynucleoside, such as a (i-L-2'-deoxynucleoside, and in particular, [3-L-2*-deoxythymidine. Alternatively, the 2,2'-anhydro-l-furanosyl-nucleoside can be reacted with a nucleophilie agent, e.g. an organometallic agent (e.g. a Griguard reagent or an alkyl lithium reagent), to give the desired 2'-substituted nucleoside.<br>
Figure 24 of the present invention utilizes L-arabinose (T) as a starting material to prepare p-L-2'-deoxy-thymidine in a 5-step synthesis. I -arabinose (T) initially is reacted with cyanamide under conditions taught in the prior art to form the intermediate, L-arabinofuranosyl amino oxazoiine (2) (see VvO 02/44194). Next, the 5 -Oil on ihe arabinose moiety of the L-arabinofuranosyl amino oxazoline intermediate (2) is protected by its reaction with trityl chloride (TrCl) and pyridine at a temperature of about 45 °C (3). The addition of an OH-protecting group under these conditions is also well known to those skilled in the art (Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, (1991) John Wiley and Sons, 2nd Edition).<br>
Step 3 of the process depicted in Figure 24 shows the reaction under appropriate conditions as taught in the prior art of the 5'-trityl-protected L-arabinofuranosyl amino oxazoline (3) with a cyclization or condensation agent selected from an}' of the following:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
For example, if structure (ii) shown above is used as a condensing or cyclization agent, the reaction is carried out in the presence of Na^CCVHiO and the subsequent isomerization is effected by the addition of Pd/Al2O.-i/H:O (see WO 02/44194). However, if the condensing or cyclization agent (i) is used, the reaction is carried out in methyl 2-formylpropionate at reflux for 1 hour (see EP 0 351 126). Cyclization results in the formation of 2,2'-anhydro-l -(L-arabinofuranosyl)thymidine (4).<br>
The next step of the present invention involves the reduction of 2,2'-anhydro-l-(L-arabinofuranosyl)thymidine (4) with a reducing agent such as Red-Al, and a sequestering agent such MS 1 5-ivnv.&gt; -no etlw. in the presence ol a polar solvent such ;&gt;v THF and/or DME, preferably at reduced temperatures such as from about 0-5 °C to provide (i-L-5'-trityl-2'-deoxythymidine (5).<br>
Using a sequestering agent such as 15-crown-5 ether at this step is advantageous due to an increase in solubility of the 2,2'-anhydro-l-('L-arabinofuranosyl)thymidine that results in higher perci-nl yield of product, and the avoidance of using reagents such as<br>
palladium catalysts whose removal requires labor-intensive efforts. Moreover, the use of 15-cro\vn-5 ether circumvents the use of HBr to open the anhydro-ring structure, necessitating the use of H? with poisoned catalyst Pd-BaSO.i to remove bromide (see EP 0 351 126), thereby avoiding the use of dangerous reagents found in certain prior art processes. Finally, the process of the present invention avoids the use of dioxane as a reagent. This is advantageous because dioxane is flammable and inappropriate for an industrially scalable synthesis.<br>
The final step in the process shown in Figure 24 is removal of the trilyl-protective group from the 5'-positioii on [3-L-2'-deoxythymidinc (5) by treatment with 80% AcOH at a temperature of about 50 °C to form L-2'-deoxythymidine (6).<br>
Alternatively, selective protection of L-arabinose (T) at the C-5 position using trityl is possible by reacting L-arabinose (I) with TrCl (trityl chloride) and pyridine at a temperature of about 45 °C to form &gt;TrO-L-arabinose (structure not shown). Next the 5-TrO-L-arabinose is reacted with cyanamide under conditions taught in the prior art to form the intermediate, 5-TrO-L-arabmofuranosyl amino oxazoline (3) (see WO 02/44194). The remainder of the steps in the process are as given in Figure 24 for formation of structures (4), (5), and (6).<br>
Figure 25 shows a synthesis of the present invention that is similar to that depicted in Figure 24 but differs in the steps in which intermediates are Oil-protected. As in Figure 24, L-arabinose (Jj is useu as a starting material and is reacted with cyanamide to afford L-arabinofuranosyl amino oxazoline as an intermediate (2_). L-Arabinofuranosyl amino oxazoline. (2) is then reacted with any one of the cyclization/condensation reagents given above in structures (i)-(ix) under appropriate conditions as taught in the prior art to provide 2,2'-anhydro-l-(L-arabinofuranosyOthymidine (3). The 2.2'-.mhydro-l-(L-arabinoftiranosyl)thymidine (3) next is reacted with TrC'l and pyridine at a temperature ol about 45 °C to protect the 5'-OH on the arabinose moiety of the 2,2'-anhydro compound (£). This step should be compared to Figure 24, su-p 2, where a trityl group was added to the 5'-of the arabino moiety of the arabinofuranosyl amino oxa/.nline prior to reacting it with a cyclization or condensation reagent. The last 2 steps of the 5-step process shown in Figure 25 are identical to the last 2 st<. provided in figure and provide s thymidine deprotect d></.>
Applicants concluded that the process described in Figure 24 is more efficient than that depicted in Figure 25 based on the addition of the trityl-protective group at the 5'-position in a step that occurs earlier in the synthesis than heretofore seen in the prior art.<br>
From Ribo-Furunose<br>
In another process of the present invention, a furanose, such as an L-furanose, and in particular L-ribose, can be used as the starting material to prepare the 2,2'-anhydro-1-furanosyl-nucleoside, which is then reduced according to the present invention to give a 2"-deoxynucleosidc, such as a p-L-2'-deoxynucleoside, and in<br>
particular,    (i-L-y-deo.\ylliymidine	Alternatively,    llie    2,2'-;inhydro-Munmosyl<br>
nucleoside can he reacted with a nucleophilic agent, e.g. an organometallic agent (e.g. a Grignard reagent or an alkyl lithium reagent), to give the desired 2"-substituted nucleoside.<br>
Figure 26 shows a 7-step synthesis for making 2'-deoxythymidine utilizing D-ribose as a starting material In the first step of this process, all OH groups on D-ribose are protected such as, for example, with acetyl or ben/.oyl groups as known by those skilled in the art. The protected D-ribose next is reacted with thymine in the presence of, for example, SnCU, HMDS, and TMSC1 as known in the prior art to provide thymidine that has protective group.1, at the ?.'-, 3'- and 5'-positions on the nucleoside. The protective groups are removed in step 3 by reagents and under conditions appropriate for removal of the particular p; &gt;tective i;roup attached. The intermediate produced in step 3 is thymidine.<br>
Step 4 in Figure 26 introduces a cyclization/condensation step directly from thymidine rather than from the furanosyl ammo oxazonne as snown in Figures 24 and 25. Here, thymidine is reacted with PhOCOOPh and NaHCCh catalyst in the presence of DMF at a temperature of about 150 °C to afford 2,2'-anhydro-l-(ribofuranosyl)-thymidine.<br>
The 2,2'-anhydro-l-(ribofuranosyl) thymidine structures 5 and 6 represent two separate embodiments of ihe present invention, in that structure 5 is derived from the thymidine structure 4 with protective groups at the 3'- and 5'-positions on the ribo<br>
moiety of thymidine, and structure 6 is derived from a thymidine structure wherein the 3'- and 5'-positions on the ribo moiety of thymidine are unprotected. In either instance, the 2'-OH of thymidine must be a free OH group so that it can participate in the reaction providing the 2,2'-anhydro-l-(ribofuranosyl)thymidine structure. If the synthesis proceeds via structure 5, in one embodiment, the 5'-protective group is trityi: an additional step may then be performed to remove the protective group from the 3"-position of the ribo moiety prior to reduction with a reducing agent such as Red-Al, and a sequestering agent such as 15-crown-5 ether, to form structure (8).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention depicted in Figure 26, the synthesis proceeds via structure 6, where T'rCl and pyridine are reacted with 2.2'-anhydro-l-(ribofuranosyl)thymidine at about 45 °C to provide 5'-trilylated 2,2'-anhydro-l-(ribofuranosyl)thymidine that is structure (7). 5'-Tritylated 2,2'-anhydro-l-(ribo-furanosyl)thymidine then is reduced by reacting it with a reducing agent such as Red-Al, and a sequestering agent such as 15-crown-5 ether, in a polar solvent, such as THF and/or DME, preferably at a temperature of about 0-5 °C. This step affords 5'-tritylated-2'-deoxythymidinc (8), which is then deprotected by reacting it with 80% AcOH at about 50 °C to provide D-2'-deoxythymidme (^). The process shown in Figure 26 provides a means for preparing a 2,21-anhydro-furanosyl-thyrnidine directly from thymidine or protected thymidine without involving a furanosyl-amino-oxazolidine intermediate and an accompanying condensation or cyclization step.<br>
Figure 27 shows a 5-step process starling from L-ribose to prepare L-2'-deoxy-thymklme. In this synthesis. I.-ribose is reacted with thymine and SnCLj in TMSC1 and HMDS to form thymidine (2_). Thymidine next is reacted with PhOCOOPh and NaHCOa catalyst in DMF at about 150 °C to provide L-2,2'-anhydro-ribofuranosyl-thymidine (3). This L-2,2'-anhydro-ribofuranosyl-thyinidine is reacted with TrCl and pyridine at about<br>
45 °C to afford 5'-trityl-protected L-2,2'-anhydro-ribofuranosyl-thymidine (4), and this, in turn, is reduced by reaction with a reducing agent such as Red-Al, and a sequestering agent such as 15-crown-5 ether, in a polar solvent such as THF and/or DME, preferably at temperatures of from about 0-5 °C to produce 5'-trityl-L-2'-deoxy-thymidine (5). Finally compound (5) is deprotected by reacting it with 80% AcOH at about 50 °C to form L-2'-deoxythymidine (6). This synthesis is both efficient in the number of steps required, and also avoids formation of a ribofuranosyl-amino-oxazolidine.<br>
Figure 28 depicts an 8-step process for preparing 2'-deoxythymidine from L-ribose. L-ribose (I) initially is protected by any protecting group under conditions appropriate for using that protective group (2) as known by one skilled in the art. Protected L-ribose (2) is reacted with thymine and SnCLj in the presence of TMSC1 and HMDS, a step known in the prior art, to form ihymidinc that has protective groups at its 2'-, 3'-, and 5'-positions (3). The protected thymidine (3) next is deprotected (4) by using reagents and conditions appropriate for the removal of the particular protective group utilized, and the unprotected thymidine (4) is reacted with PhOCOOPh and NaHC03 catalyst in the presence of DMF at about 140-150 °C to form 2,2'-anhydro-l-ribofuranosyl-thymidine (5) or (6). It is to be noted that if 2,2'-anhydro-l-ribofuranosyl-thymidine (5) is the intennediatc prepared, an additional step is required after the formation of intermediate (4) in which the 31- and 5'-positions on thymidine are reacted to place protective groups at those positions. Trityl groups are the preferred protective groups for this intermediate. If intermediate (6) is prepared, it can be prepared directly from the thymidine structure (4J.<br>
Next, intennediatc (5), if used, must undergo deprotection at its 3*-position with reagents and under conditions appropriate to remove the protective group from this position, in order to provide the 5'-trityl-protected 2,2'-anhydro-l-ribofuranosyl-thymidine (7). However, if intermediate (16) is used, it can be reacted with TrCl and pyridine at about 45 °C to provide 5'-trityl-protected 2,2'-anhydro-l-ribofuranosyl-thymidine (7).<br>
5'-Trityl-protected 2,2'-anliydro-l-riboi'uranosyl-thymidine (7) then is reduced with a reducing agent such as Red-Al, and a sequestering agent such as 15-crown-5 ether, in a polar solvent such as T1IF and/or DME, preferably at a temperature of from about 0-5 °C. to afford 5'-trityl-protected thymidine (8), which is then deprotected by reaction with 80% AcOH at a temperature of about 50 °C to provide L-riho-2'-deoxythymidine (9)<br>
The synthesis depicted in Figure 28 avoids proceeding through a furanosyl-amino-oxazolidine intermediate that requires an additional condensation step to form its corresponding 2,2'-anhydro compound. It also permits choices with respect to which intermediates should be protected at different steps in the process.<br>
In another process of the present invention, the synthesis of the desired compounds can be accomplished in the absence of a sequestering agent (see Figure 29). The use of a sequestering agent such as, for example, 15-crown-5 ether, affords a higher percent product yield when dimethoxy trityl is the protecting group, however, when trityl alone is used as a protecting group, the use of a sequestering agent such as, for example, 15-crown-5 ether, affords a lower percent product yield. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the synthesis of the desired compounds can be accomplished in the absence of a sequestering agent when trityl is used as the protecting group, as in Figure 29.<br>
Figure 29 depicts a 3-step process for preparing 2'-deoxythymidine. The process comprises:<br>

(b) preparing 2'-deoxy-5'-O-trityl-n-D-thymidine (3) from 2,2'-anhydro-l-(5-0-trityl-D-D-arabinofuranosyl) thymine (2)_by  reducing 2,2'-anhydro-l-(5-0-trityl-0-D-<br>
arabinofuranosyl)  thymine  (2),   for  example,  by  suspending  (2)  in  anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and cooling the suspension to about   0-5°C in an ice-bath.   In a separate flask immersed in the ice-bath, a 65% wt solution of Red-Al in toluene can be diluted with the appropriate solvent, for example, by addition to anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. This diluted Red-Al solution can then be cooled to about 0-5°C and added dropwise via syringe to the suspension of 2,2'-anhydro-l-(5-0-trityl-G-D-arabinofuranosyl) thymine (2). The rate of dropwise addition of the Rcd-Al solution is critical to the reaction and can be completed in about 1 hour.  The resulting clear solution was maintained at about 0-5°C for 1 hour after which time, t.l.c. analysis indicated the presence of starting material (R(- 0.34), required product (Rf 0.47) and impurities (Rr 0.42 and 0.26). 11PLC analysis indicated presence of starting material (11.35 mins,  36.5% AUC),  product (12.60 mins, 24%) and  little of the major impurity (11.7 mins, 2.9%). After a total of about 2 hours at about 0-5°C, an additional portion of an "undiluted" 65% wt solution of Red-Al in toluene was added dropwise via syringe over a period of about 20 minutes to the reaction mixture which was maintained at about 0-5°C. After a further 1 hour, t.l.c. and HPLC analysis indicated presence of starting material (11.35 mins, 3.2%). A further portion of a 65% wt solution of Red-Al in toluene was added dropwise and the reaction mixture maintained at about 0-5°C for a further 45 minutes.   After this time, t.l.c. analysis indicated only a trace amount of remaining starting material. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated NH^Cl solution and the tetrahydrofuran layer was decanted. The aqueous layer was extracted with isopropylacetate, and the resulting emulsion was broken by slow addition of 5N MCI solution. The organic layer was separated, combined with the tetrahydrofuran layer and washed with sat. NH4C1 solution, and then with brine. The pH of the brine layer was 6.5 to 7 at this point and the organic layer was dried with Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacua to yield a foamy solid. The crude residue was co-evaporated with toluene, concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residue was taken into toluene by heating to about ^liV. Th*. mixture was cooled to room temp, and stirred at this temperature until a white solid began to precipitate. Water was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture stirred at room temperature for about 3 hours. The solid was isolated by filtration and the filter cake washed with water and toluene. The solid was dried at about 45°C under high<br>
vacuum for about 1 hour, and then at room temperature under vacuum overnight to yield 2'-deoxy-5'-(9-trityl-D-D-thymidinc 3 in an approximate 41% yield;<br>
(c) preparing 2'-deoxy-D-thymidine (4) from 2'-deoxy-5'-O-trityl-D-D-thymidine (3) 2'-deoxy-5'-0-trityl-!J-D-thymidine 3 (1.215 g, 2.5 mmol) by suspending (3) in methanol and heating the reaction mixture to about 45°C in a water bath until (3) dissolved. The flask was then cooled to room temperature and concentrated. HC1 was added to the mixture and stirred at room temperature. After about 25 minutes, a white solid began to precipitate from the solution. After 1 hour, t.l.c. analysis indicated no remaining starting material (R( 0.53) and formation of major product (R(-0.21). A portion of n-heptane was added to the reaction mixture and stirred at room temperature for about 15 minutes. The white solid was isolated by filtration. The filtrate was split into two layers and the methanol layer was extracted with n-heptane, and then concentrated in vacua to a volume of 2 mL. The residue was combined with the 405 mg of white solid, suspended in TBME, and stirred at room temp for 1 hour. The white solid was isolated by filtration, washed with TBME, and dried under vacuum in an oven to yield 2'-deoxy-D-thymidine (4) in approximately 78% yield.<br>

D-Xylose is oxidized with bromine/water and then the resulting 1,4-lactone is subjected to HBr/acetic acid to obtain 2,5-dibromo-2,5-dideoxy-D-lyxono- 1,4-lactone 2. Treatment of the dibromolactone 2 with potassium iodide in TEA gives the corresponding 5-iodo compound and also results in selective removal of the bromine atom at C-2 to give the 5-iodo-2-deoxylactone 3. Subjecting this 5-iodo-lactone 3 to aqueous potassium hydroxide gives the 4,5-epoxide derivative, which on treatment with aqueous acid gives the corresponding 2-deoxy L-ribonolactone via a stereospecific inversion at C-4.

Example 23(a):   I)-Xylono-l,4-lactone (2) from D-xylose (1) via bromine oxidation<br>
D-Xylose 1 (100 g, 666,1 inmol) was dissolved in distilled water (270 mL) and cooled to 0°C under overhead stiiring in a 11, three-necked round-bottomed flask-Potassium carbonate (113.2g, 819.3 mmol) was added portion-wise maintaining the temperature below 20"C. Bromine (3^.4 ml, 766.0 mmol) was then added drop-wise at 0 to 5°C over a period of 2 hours whilst maintaining the temperature below 10°C. The reaction mixture was maintained at about 5-10°C for a further 30 minutes and then warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. After about 8 hours, t.l.c. analysis (10% memanol in ethyl acetate, visuali/ed using vanillin) indicated no starting material (Rf 0.0) and a new p; tduct (Rf 0.3). The reaction mixture was stirred with formic acid (6.6 mL) for about 1 minutes and then concentrated in vuumtni at 45°C to a volume of approximately 50 ml Co-evaporation with acetic acid (200 mL) and concentration in vacuum at about 45°C to a volume of 60 mL was performed and the crude D-xylono-1,4-lactone 2 transferred to be used as is in the next step.<br>
Advantages of this synthetic step include switching from BaCOs known in the prior art to K;CO3 provided superior loading ratio (50 g of D-xylose 1 in 135 ml. of water compared to 400 ml. for BaCO-,); lactone can be used without further purification/removal of KBr salt in the next step; residual KBr can be used for the next reaction; and co-evaporation with acetic anhydride to remove residual water leads to formation of less polar products by t.l.c. analysis.<br>

Advantages to ii :, synthetic step included the ability to carry out the reaction at 45°C dramatically shortened the reaction time from 24 hours as known in the prior art; removal of KBr salt by filtration was possible after treatment with methanol and this is essential to allow easy extraction of the product; and careful temperature control of the quenching reaction was very important to prevent formation of byproducts.<br>

 (Figure Removed)<br>
2,2'-Anhydro-l-(5-0-trityl-[.,-D-arabinofuranosyl) thymine (2] (4.30g, 8.91 mmol) was suspended in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (43 mL) and cooled to about 0-5°C using an ice-bath. In a separate flask immersed in an ice-bath at about 0-5°C, a 65% wt solution of Red-Al in toluene (3.26 mL, 10.69 mmol) was diluted by addition to<br>
anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (21.5 ml/). This diluted Red-Al solution was cooled to about 0-5°C and added dropwise via syringe- 10 the suspension of 2,2:-anhydro-l-(5-O-trityl-L-D-arabinofuranosyl) thymine (2j in tetrahydrofuran. Tiie rate of dropvvise addition of the Red-A] solution is critical to the reaction and was completed in about 1 hour. The resulting clear solution was maintained at about 0-5°C for 3 hour after which time, t.l.c. analysis (10% methanol in dichloromethane) indicated the presence of starting material (Rf 0.34), required product (Rf 0.47) and impurities (Rf 0.42 and 0.26). HPLC analysis indicated presence of starting material (11.35 mins, 36.5% AUC), product (12.60 mins, 24%) and little of the major impurity (11.7 mins, 2.9%). After a total of about 2 hours at about 0-5°C, an additional portion of an "undiluted" 65% wt solution of Red-Al in toluene (1.63 mL, 5.35 mmol) was added dropwise via syringe over a period of about 20 minutes to the reaction mixture, which  was maintained at about 0-5°C.   After about a further 1 hour, t.l.c. and HPLC analysis indicated presence of starting material (11.35 mins, 3.2%). A further portion of a 6:&gt;% wt solution of Red-A! in toluene (0.26 mL, 0.85 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture maintained at about 0-5°C for a further 45 minute period. After this tune, t.l.c. analysis indicated only a trace amount of remaining starting material. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated NH^Cl solution (40 mL) and the tetrahydroluran layer was decanted. The aqueous layer was extracted with isopropylacetate (50 mL) and the resulting emulsion was broken by .slow addition of 5N HC1 solution (15 mL). The organic layer was separated, combined with the tetrahydrofuran layer and washed with saturated NH-jCl solution (30 mL) and then brine (30 mL). The pH of the brine layer was 6.5 to 7 at this point, and the organic layer was dried with NaoSO^, filtered and concentrated in vacua to yield a foamy solid (4.4g). The crude residue was co-evaporated with toluene (30 mL), concentrated in vacua and ihc resulting residue was taken into toluene (25 mL) by heating to about 45"C.
