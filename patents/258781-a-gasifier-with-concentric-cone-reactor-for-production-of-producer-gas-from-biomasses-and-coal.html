				<td>Following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner it is to be performed.<br>
4. DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to improved gasifier for converting the solid biomasses to gaseous fuel called producer gas with maximum   calorific   value   with   less   of   tar   and   particulars<br>
comprising<br>
A circular reducer shaped reactor where the diameter is minimum at the biomass inlet point and maximum near the grate area to avoid chocking of   biomasses in the   reactor.<br>
A rotary valve at the biomass intake area to control the flow<br>
of biomass and air	into the       reactor.<br>
Air inlet ports provided at the circumference of the reactor below the rotary valve to have a controlled passing of air.<br>
Reactor chamber in which a self sustained high temperature<br>
is maintained, where the tar and acids generated from the<br>
biomasses is cracked. So that tar and        acid	content    in<br>
producer gas is very minimum<br><br>
Producer gas produced is sucked out from the reactor by<br>
means of a SS open        impeller type	blower from top of the<br>
moving grate<br>
Ash and charcoal is held and discharged from the reactor using a moving grate      arrangement.<br>
Water jacket provided near the reactor zone to produce<br>
steam, if require either for       water	gas    production    and<br>
other utilization.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The scarcity of energy compelled man to look into different energy sources. The technology of production of gaseous fuel from bio residue in an efficient and environmentally benign manner was available since last century. In the ordinary process, Biomass is loaded to chamber and burned with controlled air passage, so as to enable the production of gaseous fuel containing high levels of Carbon monoxide, Hydrogen and Methane .But this process suffers from many flaws.<br>
One of the main problems while using this process is that the tar , acids and particles generated during gasification will damage the    down stream equipments connected to the gasifier.<br><br>
This invention provides for a process in which the producer gas produced will have very low tar, acid and particles which can be used for thermal applications and on further cleaning and filtering can be used as a fuel for I.C engines.<br>
To achieve the said objectives, the process comprises of the following<br>
An circular reducer shaped reactor where the diameter is minimum at the biomass inlet point and maximum near the grate area to avoid chocking of biomasses in        the    reactor.<br>
A rotary valve at the biomass intake area to control the flow of biomass and air        into the       reactor.<br>
Air inlet ports provided at the circumference of the reactor below the rotary valve to        have a controlled passing of air.<br>
Reactor chamber in which a self sustained high temperature<br>
is maintained, where the tar and acids generated from the<br>
biomasses is cracked, So that tar and        acid	content     in<br>
producer gas is very minimum<br>
Producer gas produced is sucked out from the reactor by<br>
means of a SS open       impeller type	blower from top of the<br>
moving grate<br><br>
Ash and charcoal is held and discharged from the reactor using a moving grate     arrangement.<br>
Water jacket provided near the reactor zone to produce<br>
steam, if require either for       water	gas    production    and<br>
other utilization.<br>
The detailed process is given in the drawing First charcoal is fed into the biomass reactor through the top, from the grate up till the air nozzle area.<br>
The shape of the reactor is the most important feature of improved gasifier. A circular reducer shaped reactor where the diameter is minimum at the biomass inlet point and maximum near the grate area will help to improve the gasifier in many ways.<br>
j.	It will help to have very high self sustained high temperature<br>
zone near the air nozzle	because of lesser diameter near the<br>
air nozzle area, ii.       Because of the above any gas passing from top of the reactor<br>
will have to pass through     this high temperature zone which will<br>
in turn gets burned.<br>
iii.      Since the reactor has a lesser diameter on top and higher diameter at the bottom chances for biomasses chocking is avoided.<br><br>
As the charcoal is fed into the biomass reactor, this forms to a bed which acts as the filter for ash ,tar and particulates. Biomass is fed from the air nozzle area up till the top of the reservoir. Biomass is fired through the fire nozzle. Since the gasifier is under negative pressure attained by the induced draught blower, air is sucked through the air nozzle as well as through the rotary valve.<br>
A minimum level indicator in the biomass reservoir chamber so that once the level reaches this minimum level a sensing device gets activated and gives us indication to fill the biomass. Biomass can be filled using a bucked hoist, bucket elevator or can be done manually according to the biomass used and capacity of the gasifier.<br>
This controlled supply of	air burns the biomass<br>
to create a self sustained high temperature zone called reactor zone. The temperature in the reactor zone is so high that the biomass on top of the reactor zone gets heated up and starts devofatisation. Because of the draught from top of the rotary valve, these devolatiles, tar and acids from biomass gets carried to the reactor along with air. In the reactor, this gets cracked which will help to reduce tar in the producer gas thus formed.<br>
The rotary valve fixed to the gasifier has following features:-<br><br>
1. The rotatory valve controls the flow of biomass into the<br>
reactor. It   enables the	level     of biomass in the reactor<br>
intact.<br>
2	The rotatory valve also controls the flow of air into the reactor.<br>
3	It enables an automatic packing of biomass in the reactor avoiding void spaces	between biomasses which in turn will not permit free flow of air into	the	reactor zone. More   over, it saves the labour cost involved in<br>
packing the  biomass in the reactor.<br>
The flow of air through the reactor, allows devolatization of<br>
the biomass and partial gasification of the char. The air from the<br>
air inlets enable the oxidation of charcoal. The production of<br>
gaseous fuel takes place	in the reactor chamber. As soon as<br>
the gaseous fuel is produced, it is sucked by using an open impellor SS Blower, producing clean gaseous fuel.<br>
The gaseous fuel produced passes through the charcoal bed below the reactor and this acts as a filter. The gas outlet from the gasifier is taken from top of the moving grate , so that not much particulates or ash gets carried along with the producer gas. Moving grate operates at regular intervals to discharge the charcoal and ash from the gasifier. The reducer shape of the gasifier will help to sink the biomass and charcoal to<br><br>
replace the ash and charcoal discharged through the moving grate during operation.<br>
The gas generated from this process can<br>
be used for thermal application is a hot      gas	mode	by<br>
passing the gas through a gas trap and a cyclonic separator. It can be used in a cold gas mode by passing the gas through a water scrubber, cyclone etc. If this gasifier has to be used for power     generation   ,in   addition   to   the   cold   gas<br>
mode , an electro static precipitator and a filter has to be provided in order to clean and filter the gas to the standards of engine manufacturer.<br><br><br><br><br>
