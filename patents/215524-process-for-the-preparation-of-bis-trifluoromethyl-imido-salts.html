				<td>Processes for the preparation of bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salts<br>
The present invention relates to novel processes for the preparation of<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salts of the general formula (I):<br>
Ma+[(N(CF3)2)-]a<br>
(I)<br>
The chemistry of the bis(trifluoromethyl)imido anion is generally based on the<br>
chemical reaction of perfluoro(2-azapropene), CF3N=CF2, as starting material (H.G.<br>
Ang and Y.C. Syn, Advances in Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry, Vol. 16<br>
(1974), pp. 1-64; A. Haas, Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, 8th Edition,<br>
Springer Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg, New York (1991), Part 9, pp. 125-153; A. Haas,<br>
Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry, 8th Edition, Springer Verlag: Berlin,<br>
Heidelberg, New York (1991), Suppl. Vol. 6, pp. 196-214). This compound can be<br>
prepared by fluorination of CCl3N=CCl2 using NaF in sulfolane at 105°C in a yield of<br>
78% (E. Klauke, H. Holtschmidt, K. Findeisen, Farbenfabriken Bayer AG, DE-A1-<br>
2101107 (1971/1972)) or by photolysis of CF3N-(CF2CFC12)Cl (G. Sawar, R.L.<br>
Kirchmeier and J.M. Shreeve, Inorg. Chem. 28 (1989, pp. 2187-2189)) in gas at room<br>
temperature (boiling point -33°C), with special industrial apparatuses being necessary<br>
for the said compound.<br>
Di[bis(trifluoromethyl)imido]mercury, Hg[N(CF3)2]2, which is very reactive, was<br>
synthesised for the first time by Young and his co-workers (J.A. Young, S.N.<br>
Tsoukalas and R.D. Dresdner, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80 (1958), pp. 3604-3606). This<br>
compound is a good reagent for the introduction of N(CF3)2 groups into organic<br>
molecules (H.G. Ang and Y.C. Syn, see above; A. Haas, Gmelin Handbook of<br>
Inorganic Chemistry, 8th edition, Springer Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg, New York<br>
(1981), Part 9, pp. 45-46), but is not a very stable compound since it is extremely<br>
sensitive to moisture. The synthesis of Hg[N(CF3)2]2 is difficult, time-consuming and<br>
requires special industrial apparatuses and expensive starting materials.<br>
Caesium bis(trifluoromethyl)imide, [Cs]+[N(CF3)2]-, is a further option for the<br>
synthesis of bis(trifluoromethyl)amino compounds. This salt is prepared by simply<br>
passing perfluoro(2-azapropene) into a solution of caesium fluoride in dry acetonitrile<br>
(A.F. Gontar, E.G. Bykovskaja and IX. Knunyants, IZV. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Otd.<br>
Khim, Nauk (1975), pp. 2279-2282).<br>
The disadvantage of this method consists in the formation of a dimeric product<br>
through the reaction of the starting material perfluoro(2-azapropene) with the caesium<br>
salt that has already formed. This reaction is unavoidable and results in the formation<br>
of complex product mixtures.<br>
However, N(CF3)2 anions are readily accessible through the reaction of some metal<br>
fluorides with N,N-bis(trifluoromethyl)perfluoroalkanesulfonamides or -acylamides<br>
["N(CF3)2 anion preparation, and its use", EP 99 101 982]. This process enables the<br>
generation of Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ag, Cu(II) and Hg(II) salts with N(CF3)2 anions.<br>
However, the analogous reaction of N,N-bis(trifluoro-<br>
methyl)perfluoroalkanesulfonamides or -acylamides with other metal fluorides (for<br>
example ZnF2 and CdF2) progresses only very slowly due to the poor solubility of<br>
these fluorides in organic solvents.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to provide an improved process for<br>
the preparation of bis(trifluoromethyl)imidp salts.<br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by a process for the preparation of<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salts of the general formula (I)<br>
[Ma+] [(N(CF3)2)-]a<br>
(I)<br>
in which<br>
Ma+<br>
M is a monovalent or divalent cation, and a = 1 or 2,<br>
characterised in that at least one trifluoromethanesulfonate of the general<br>
formula (II)<br>
[Ma+][(OSO2CF3)-]a<br>
(II)<br>
in which<br>
Ma+ is a monovalent or divalent cation, and a = 1 or 2,<br>
is reacted with bis(trifluoromethyl)imidorubidium in solution, and the resultant<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salt of the general formula (I) is, if desired, purified<br>
and/or isolated by conventional methods.<br>
Preference is given to process according to the invention in which Ma+ is a sodium,<br>
potassium, caesium, copper or silver cation, and a = 1.<br>
Particular preference is given to processes according to the invention in which Ma+ is a<br>
mercury, copper, zinc or cadmium cation, and a = 2.<br>
Particular preference is also given to processes according to the invention in which a =<br>
1 and Ma+ is a cation of the general formula (III)<br>
[([Rb1Rc2Rd3Re4]Ax)yKt]+<br>
(III)<br>
in which<br>
Kt = N, P, As, Sb, S or Se,<br>
A = N, P, P(O), O, S, S(O), SO2, As, As(O), Sb or Sb(O),<br>
R1, R2, R3 and R4 are identical or different and are<br>
H, halogen, substituted and/or unsubstituted alkyl CnH2n+1, substituted and/or<br>
unsubstituted C1-18-alkenyl having one or more double bonds, substituted and/or<br>
unsubstituted C1-18-alkynyl having one or more triple bonds, substituted and/or<br>
unsubstituted cycloalkyl CmH2m-1, monosubstituted, polysubstituted and/or<br>
unsubstituted phenyl, substituted and/or unsubstituted heteroaryl;<br>
where<br>
n=1-18,<br>
m = 3 - 7,<br>
x = 0 or 1,<br>
y=1-4,y=lforx = 0,<br>
where<br>
b, c, d and e are each = 0 or 1, where b+c+d+e ? 0,<br>
A may be included in various positions in R1, R2, R3 and/or R4,<br>
Kt may be included in a cyclic or heterocyclic ring,<br>
the groups bonded to Kt may be identical or different.<br>
The processes according to the invention also enable the preparation of novel<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salts which are difficult to access, such as, for example,<br>
cadmium, zinc or copper(I) N(CF3)2 salts. Novel salts therefore represent a further <br>
subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
The salts prepared in accordance with the invention can be used alone or in mixtures<br>
with other salts as conductive salts or additives in electrolytes. Besides the salt or salt<br>
mixtures, the electrolytes also comprise solvents or solvent mixtures.<br>
These electrolytes are employed in electrochemical cells (such as, for example,<br>
primary and secondary batteries). They are preferably employed in capacitors and<br>
supercapacitors.<br>
The starting materials bis(trifluoromethyl)imidorubidium and the trifluoro-<br>
methanesulfonate salts are both readily soluble in a number of organic solvents. In<br>
addition, metal triflates are commercially available from a number of companies.<br>
The reaction of Rb[N(CF3)2] and metal triflates at room temperature or below takes<br>
place rapidly, for example in accordance with the following general reaction scheme:<br>
xRb[N(CF3)2] + M(OSO2CF3)x -+ M [N(CF3)2]X + x Rb(OSO2CF3)<br>
In the process according to the invention, the conversion to a bis(trifluoromethyl)imido<br>
salt of the general formula (I) is preferably carried out at a temperature of from -60 to<br>
+60°C, particularly preferably from -50 to +50°C, very particularly preferably at from<br>
-45 to +30°C.<br>
Preferred solvents for the conversion to a bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salt of the<br>
general formula (I) are organic solvents, particularly preferably polar organic<br>
solvents.<br>
Very particularly preferred solvents for the conversion to a bis(trifluoromethyl)imido<br>
salt of the general formula (I) are the solvents acetonitrile, benzonitrile,<br>
dimethoxyethane and/or propionitrile or a mixture of acetonitrile, benzonitrile,<br>
dimethoxyethane and/or propionitrile.<br>
Preferred solvents according to the invention comprise = 0.1% by weight of water,<br>
preferably = 0.01% by weight of water, particularly preferably = 0.005% by weight of<br>
water.<br>
In the preferred processes according to the invention, the trifluoromethanesulfonate<br>
salt of the general formula (II) or the bis(trifluoromethyl)imidorubidium is employed<br>
in a molar excess of = 3% or particularly preferably in equimolar amounts.<br>
The rubidium triflate formed by the process according to the invention has<br>
limited solubility in organic solvents and can be separated off from the reaction<br>
mixture as a solid at low temperatures.<br>
Preferred processes according to the invention are therefore those in which<br>
the bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salt of the general formula (I) is purified by<br>
filtration at a temperature of from -90 to +30°C, particularly preferably at from<br>
-70 to +20°C, after removal of the solvent.<br>
Further purification of a bis(trifluoromethyl)imido salt of the general formula (I) is<br>
possible by extraction with dichloromethane and/or hexane and/or diethyl ether.<br>
Extraction with dichloromethane is a preferred variant of the present invention.<br>
The invention is explained below with reference to examples. These examples<br>
serve merely to explain the invention and do not restrict the general inventive<br>
idea.<br>

CuOSO2CF3-CH3CN in 1.8 ml of dry acetonitrile with stirring. The mixture was stirred<br>
for one hour. A white sediment formed in the process. The solvent acetonitrile was<br>
removed by suction filtration at room temperature, and 4 ml of dry dichloromethane<br>
were added to the residue. After the mixture had been stirred at room temperature for<br>
ten minutes, the solution was separated from the residue, and the solvent was removed<br>
by suction filtration at room temperature. 0.150 g of Cu[N(CF3)2]CH3CN was<br>
obtained as a white crystalline substance, as demonstrated by analysis. The yield was<br>
76.5%.<br>

fluoride and 0.218 g (0.766 mmol) of CF3SO2N(CF3)2 in 3.2 ml of dry propionitrile<br>
was added at -45°C to a solution of 0.155 g (0.383 mmol) of Zn(OSO2CF3)2CH3CN in<br>
1.8 ml of dry propionitrile with stirring. The mixture was stirred for one hour at -45°C.<br>
A white sediment formed in the process. The mixture was then cooled to -78°C and<br>
left at this temperature without stirring for two hours. The solvent was removed by<br>
suction filtration, a small amount of CD3CN (about 30%) was added, and the mixture<br>
was characterised by 19F NMR spectroscopy at -45°C.<br>
The signal at -44.83 ppm is assigned to Zn[N(CF3)2]2, which is coordinated with the<br>
solvent.<br>
In order to isolate the salt, the solvent was removed by suction filtration at -30°C, and<br>
the white solid which remained was, after dissolution in dry CD2Cl2, employed for<br>

was added at -45°C to a solution of 0.188 g (0.383 mmol) of Cd(OSO2CF3) 2 2CH3CN<br>
in 1.8 ml of dry propionitrile with stirring. The mixture was stirred for one hour at -<br>
45°C. A white sediment formed in the process, the mixture was then cooled to -78°C<br>
and left at this temperature without stirring for two hours. The solvent was removed by<br>
suction filtration, a small amount of CD3CN (about 30% by volume) was added, and<br>
the mixture was characterised by 19F NMR spectroscopy at -40°C. The signal at -42.53<br>
ppm is assigned to Cd[N(CF3)2]2, which is coordinated with the solvent. At room<br>
temperature, the signal of the N(CF3)2 group in the 19F NMR spectrum shifts to -45.39<br>
ppm. The Cd[N(CF3)2]2nC2H5CN salt has only low stability as analysis substance at<br>
room temperature.<br><br>
Example 5:<br>
Electrochemical stability of [N(C2H5)4][N(CF3)2]<br>
In each case, a number of cyclic voltammograms were recorded successively in a<br>
measurement cell with platinum electrode, lithium counterelectrode and lithium<br>
reference electrode. To this end, the potential was firstly increased, starting from the<br>
rest potential, to 6 V against Li/Li+ at a rate of 20 mV/s and then returned to the rest<br>
potential. The electrolyte used was a solution of [N(C2H5)4][N(CF3)2] in propylene<br>
carbonate.<br>
The characteristic curve shape shown in Figure 1 is evident, with an oxidation<br>
potential Eox of greater than 5 V against Li/Li+.<br>
Example 6:<br>
Ionic conductivity of an electrolyte based on [N(C2H5)4][N(CF3)2]<br>
With the aid of a 4-pole Knick conductometer, the conductivities of<br>
[N(C2H5)4][N(CF3)2] in acetonitrile were measured as a function of temperature and<br>
concentration of the conductive salt. In parallel, [N(C2H5)4][BF4] was measured in<br>
acetonitrile. This system represents the current state of the art with respect to<br>
"supercapacitor" electrolytes and thus serves as reference. Figures 2 and 3 show the<br>
results obtained. They confirm that the novel system based on [N(C2H5)4][N(CF3)2]<br>
has significantly improved conductivities.<br><br>
