Cross Reference To Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority from provisional application number 60/602,825,<br>
filed August 19, 2004 and provisional application number 60/694,067, filed<br>
June 24, 2005. The entire content of each of these prior applications is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to protein chemistry, molecular biology, and neurobiology.<br>
Background<br>
Neublastin, also known as Artemin and Enovin, is a 24-kDa homodimeric<br>
secreted protein that promotes the survival of neurons of the peripheral and central<br>
nervous system such as dopaminergic neurons (Baudet et al., 2000, Development,<br>
127:4335; Rosenblad et al., 2000, Mol. Cell Neurosci., 15(2):199; GenBank AF120274).<br>
The gene encoding neublastin has been cloned and sequenced (Roseblad et al., 2000,<br>
Mol. Cell Neurosci., 15(2):199;Baloh et al.,Neuron, 21:1291).<br>
Neublastin is a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)<br>
ligand family. At the cellular level, GDNF members activate the receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase, RET. RET associates with a co-receptor, GDNF family receptor alpha<br>
(GFRalpha), a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked membrane protein that<br>
provides ligand specificity for RET. Four GFRalphas are known (GFRalpha 1-4).<br>
Neublastin binds to GFRalpha3 together with RET forming a ternary signaling complex(Baudet et al. 2000, Development, 127:4335; Balohetal., 1998, Neuron, 21:1291),which is localized predominantly on nociceptive sensory neurons (Orozco et al., 2001,Eur. J. Neurosci., 13(11):2177). These neurons detect pain and injury. Thus, neublastinhas clinical application in the general treatment of neuropathy and more specifically inthe treatment of neuropathic pain.<br>
Neublastin and the other GDNF family members are members of the transforming<br>
growth factor beta (TGF beta) superfamily and thus, are characterized by the presence ofseven conserved cysteine residues with similar spacing which form the structure of acysteine knot (Saarma, l999,Microsc. Res. Tech., 45:292). Each monomer contains twodisulfide bonds that form a closed loop structure encircling the third disulfide to form atight knot structure. The seventh cysteine contained within each monomer forms anintermolecular disulfide bond, covalently linking the monomers to form the final dimerproduct (Rattenholl et al 2000, J. Mol. Biol, 305:523).<br>
TGF beta family members are synthesized as pre pro proteins that eventually are<br>
secreted as a mature homodimer after cleavage of the signal peptide and pro-domain (seee.g. Rattenholl, et al., 2000, J. Mol. Biol., 305:523; Fairlie et al., 2001, J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
276(20): 16911). Both the signal peptide and pro-domain mediate proper secretion for<br>
TGF beta family members (Rattenholl et al., 2000, J. Mol. Biol., 305:523; Rattenholl et<br>
al., 2001, Eur. J. Biochem., 268:3296).<br>
Summary<br>
The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that Neublastin binds to<br>
heparin sulfate and that particular amino acid residues in the Neublastin polypeptide<br>
contribute to this binding event. Substitution of selected amino acid residues was found<br>
to decrease heparin binding by variant Neublastin polypeptides and increase bioactivity<br>
and bioavailabiliry of the variants.<br>
In one aspect, the invention features a polypeptide containing an amino acid<br>
sequence that is at least 80% identical to amino acids 15-113 of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein<br>
the amino acid sequence contains at least one amino acid substitution, relative to SEQ <br>
NO: 1, selected from the group consisting of: (i) an amino acid other than arginine at the<br>
position corresponding to position 48 of SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g., the arginine is substituted<br>
with a non-conservative amino acid residue such as glutamic acid); (ii) an amino acid<br>
other than arginine at the position corresponding to position 49 of SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g., the<br>
arginine is substituted with a non-conservative amino acid residue such as glutamic acid);<br>
and (iii) an amino acid other than arginine at the position corresponding to position 51 of<br>
SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g., the arginine is substituted with a non-conservative amino acid<br>
residue such as glutamic acid). The polypeptide, when dimerized, binds to a complex<br>
containing GFRalphaS and RET.<br>
In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence contains amino acids other than<br>
arginine at the positions corresponding to position 48 and position 49 of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
For example, the arginine residue at position 48 and the arginine reside at position 49 of<br>

GFRalphaS and RET. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence is at least 90%, atleast 95%, or at least 98% identical to amino acids 15-113 of SEQ ID NO:1.<br>

An advantage of selected variant Neublastin polypeptides described herein is that<br>
they have decreased heparin binding ability as compared to wild type Neublastin.<br>
Decreased heparin binding results in a decreased clearance of the variant polypeptide<br>
in vivo.<br>
A variant Neublastin polypeptide having substitutions at amino acid positions 48<br>
and 49 was unexpectedly found to have greatly deceased heparin binding ability and<br>
greatly increased potency and bioavailabilty as compared to single amino acid mutants<br>
and/or wild type Neublastin. For example, the double mutant was found to exhibit an<br>
approximately 185-fold increase in serum exposure as compared to wild type Neublastin.<br>
In addition, this double mutant was found to exhibit an over five fold increase in<br>
expression in vitro as compared to wild type Neublastin, thereby facilitating large scale<br>
production of the protein.<br>
The advantages and unexpected properties of the variant Neublastin polypeptides<br>
allow for treatment of subjects using lower doses of protein and/or allow for lengthened<br>
intervals between administrations (as compared to treatments with the wild type protein).<br>
Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the<br>
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this<br>
invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those<br>
described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the<br>
exemplary methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent<br>
applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention provides variant Neublastin polypeptides having<br>
substitutions at selected amino acid residues. As disclosed in the accompanying<br>
Examples, specific residues in the wild type Neublastin polypeptide have been found to<br>
be important for heparin binding. Because heparin binding is believed to contribute to<br>
clearance of Neublastin in vivo, substitutions at one or more of these specific residues are<br>
expected to decrease heparin binding and thereby increase serum exposure of the variant<br>
polypeptide.<br>
Variant Neublastin Polvpeptides<br>
Mature wild type human Neublastin is 113 amino acids in length and has the<br>
following amino acid sequence: AGGPGSRARAAGARGCRLRSQLVPVRALGLGHR<br>
SDELVRFRFCSGSCRRARSPHDLSLASLLGAGALRPPPGSRPVSQPCCRPTRYEAV<br>
SFMDVNSTWRTVDRLSATACGCLG (SEQ ID NO:1).<br>
Disclosed herein are polypeptides that have substitutions at one or more selected<br>
amino acid residues of the Neublastin polypeptide. Mutations at one or more of these<br>
residues are expected to result in a variant Neublastin polypeptide having reduced or<br>
absent heparin binding ability as compared to wild type Neublastin. A variant Neublastin<br>
polypeptide contains an amino acid substitution, relative to SEQ ID NO:13 at (i) an<br>
arginine residue at one or more of positions 48,49, or 51, and/or (ii) one or more of<br>
Ser 46, Set 73, Gly 72, Arg 39, Gin 21, Ser 20, Arg 68, Arg 33, His 32, Val 94, Arg 7,<br>
Arg 9, or Arg 14. Unless otherwise stated, any reference herein to a Neublastin amino<br>
acid reside by position number refers to the numbering of residues relative to SEQ ID<br>
NO:1.<br>
A Neublastin amino acid residue designated for substitution (e.g., an arginine<br>
residue at position 48,49, and/or 51) can be substituted with a non-conservative amino<br>
acid residue (e.g., glutamic acid) or a conservative or amino acid residue. As detailed in<br>
the accompanying Examples, substitution of Arg48, Arg 49, and/or Arg 51 with a nonconservative<br>
amino acid can result in a variant Neublastin polypeptide that has reduced<br>
heparin binding activity but retained (or even enhanced) Neublastin biological activity.<br>
Exemplary amino acids that can be substituted an amino acid residue identified herein<br>
(e.g., an arginine residue at position 48, 49, and/or 51) include glutamic acid, aspartic<br>
acid, and alanine.<br>
A biologically active variant Neublastin polypeptide, when dimerized, binds to a<br>
ternary complex containing GFRalphaS and RET. Any method for detecting binding to<br>
this complex can be used to evaluate the biological activity a variant Neublastin<br>
polypeptide. Exemplary assays for detecting the ternary complex-binding ability of a<br>
variant Neublastin polypeptide are described in WOOO/01815 and in Example 7.<br>
A variant Neublastin polypeptide can also be assessed to evaluate its ability to<br>
trigger the Neublastin signaling cascade. For example, the Kinase Receptor Activation<br>
(KERA) assay described in Example 6 can be used to assess the ability of a variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptide to induce RET autophosphorylation (See also, Sadick et al., 1996,<br>
Anal Biochem., 235(2):207).<br>
In addition to the specific amino acid substitutions identified herein, a variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptide can also contain one or more additions, substitutions, and/or<br>
deletions at other amino acid positions, as detailed in the following sections.<br>
A variant Neublastin polypeptide can, in addition to having one or more of the<br>
amino acid substitutions described herein, also vary in length. Although the mature<br>
human Neublastin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1) consists of the carboxy terminal 113<br>
amino acids of pre pro Neublastin, not all of the 113 amino acids are required to achieve<br>
useful Neublastin biological activity. Amino terminal truncation is permissible. Thus, a<br>
variant Neublastin polypeptide can contain one or more of the amino acid substitutions<br>
described herein in the context of the carboxy terminal 99, 100,101, 102, 103,104, 105,<br>
106,107, 108,109,110, 111, 112, or 113 amino acids of SEQ IDNO:1 (i.e., its length<br>
can be 99,100, 101, 102,103,104, 105,106,107, 108,109, 110, 111, 112, or 113 amino<br>
acids).<br>
A variant Neublastin polypeptide can, in addition to having one or more of the<br>
amino acid substitutions described herein (and optionally having a truncation described<br>
herein), also vary in sequence, m particular, certain amino acid substitutions can be<br>
introduced into the Neublastin sequence without appreciable loss of a Neublastin<br>
biological activity. In exemplary embodiments, a polypeptide (i) contains one or more of<br>
the amino acid substitutions described herein, and (ii) is at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%,<br>
95%, 98% or 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:1 (or 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or<br>
99% identical to amino acids 15-113 of SEQ ID NO: 1). A variant Neublastin<br>
polypeptide differing in sequence from SEQ ID NO:1 (or differing in sequence from<br>
amino acids 15-113 of SEQ ID NO:1) may include one or more conservative amino acid<br>
substitutions, one or more non-conservative amino acid substitutions, and/or one or more<br>
deletions or insertions.<br>
Fig. 1 is an alignment of the wild type human, mouse, and rat pre pro Neublastin<br>
polypeptides. The vertical lines in Fig.l indicate the start of the mature 113 amino acid<br>
form (left vertical line) and 104 amino acid form (right vertical line) of Neublastin. The<br>
KRXR heparin binding motif is boxed. This alignment of naturally occurring, bioactive<br>
forms of Neublastin indicates specific exemplary residues (i.e., those that are not<br>
conserved among the human, mouse, and rat forms) that can be substituted without<br>
eliminating bioactivity.<br>
Percent identity between amino acid sequences can be determined using the<br>
BLAST 2.0 program. Sequence comparison can be performed using an ungapped<br>
alignment and using the default parameters (Blossom 62 matrix, gap existence cost of 11,<br>
per residue gap cost of 1, and a lambda ratio of 0.85). The mathematical algorithm used<br>
in BLAST programs is described in Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Research<br>
25:3389-3402.<br>

A conservative substitution is the substitution of one amino acid for another with<br>
similar characteristics. Conservative substitutions include substitutions within the<br>
following groups: valine, alanine and glycine; leucine, valine, and isoleucine; aspartic<br>
acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine, cysteine, and threonine; lysine<br>
and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine. The non-polar hydrophobic amino acids<br>
include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and<br>
methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine,<br>
tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include<br>
arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include<br>
aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Any substitution of one member of the above-mentioned<br>
polar, basic or acidic groups by another member of the same group can be deemed a<br>
conservative substitution.<br>
Non-conservative substitutions include those in which (i) a residue having an<br>
electropositive side chain (e.g., Arg, His or Lys) is substituted for, or by, an<br>
electronegative residue (e.g., Glu or Asp), (ii) a hydrophilic residue (e.g., Ser or Thr) is<br>
substituted for, or by, a hydrophobic residue (e.g., Ala, Leu, He, Phe or Val), (iii) a<br>
cysteine or proline is substituted for, or by, any other residue, or (iv) a residue having a<br>
bulky hydrophobic or aromatic side chain (e.g., Val, He, Phe or Trp) is substituted for, or<br>
by, one having a smaller side chain (e.g., Ala, Ser) or no side chain (e.g., Gly).<br>
Exemplary variant Neublastin polypeptides are disclosed in Table 1. Amino acid<br>
residues of the variant Neublastin polypeptides that are mutated as compared to the<br>
corresponding wild type position are bolded and underlined. In addition, the Neublastin<br>
polypeptide (113, 99, or 104 amino acids in length) used as the background for the<br>
substitution is depicted in Table 1.<br>

A variant Neublastin polypeptide can be optionally coupled to a polymer (e.g., a<br>
polyalkylene glycol moiety such as a polyethylene glycol moiety). In some<br>
embodiments, the polymer is coupled to the polypeptide at a site on the Neublastin<br>
polypeptide that is anN terminus. In some embodiments, the variant Neublastin<br>
polypeptide includes at least one amino acid substitution with respect to SEQ ID NO: 1 (or<br>
with respect to amino acids 15-113 of SEQ ID NO:1), which provides an internal polymer<br>
conjugation site to which a polymer can be conjugated. In some embodiments, the<br>
polymer is coupled to the variant Neublastin polypeptide at a residue (numbered in<br>
accordance with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1) selected from the group consisting of<br>
position 14, position 39, position 68, and position 95. Exemplary Neublastin variants that<br>
provide internal polymer conjugation sites are described in WO 02/060929 and WO<br>
04/069176 (the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
A polypeptide can optionally contain heterologous amino acid sequences in<br>
addition to a variant Neublastin polypeptide. "Heterologous," as used when referring to<br>
an amino acid sequence, refers to a sequence that originates from a source foreign to the<br>
particular host cell, or, if from the same host cell, is modified from its original form.<br>
Exemplary heterologous sequences include a heterologous signal sequence (e.g., native<br>
rat albumin signal sequence, a modified rat signal sequence, or a human growth hormone<br>
signal sequence) or a sequence used for purification of a variant Neublastin polypeptide<br>
(e.g., a histidine tag).<br>
Neublastin polypeptides can be isolated using methods known in the art.<br>
Naturally occurring Neublastin polypeptides can be isolated from cells or tissue sources<br>
using standard protein purification techniques. Alternatively, mutated Neublastin<br>
polypeptides can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques.<br>
The synthesis of short amino acid sequences is well established in the peptide art. See,<br>
e.g., Stewart, et al, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (2d ed., 1984).<br>
In some embodiments, variant Neublastin polypeptides are produced by<br>
recombinant DNA techniques. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptide can be inserted into a vector, e.g., an expression vector, and the<br>
nucleic acid can be introduced into a cell. Suitable cells include, e.g., mammalian cells<br>
(such as human cells or CHO cells), fungal cells, yeast cells, insect cells, and bacterial<br>
13<br>
cells. When expressed in a recombinant cell, the cell is preferably cultured under<br>
conditions allowing for expression of a variant Neublastin polypeptide. The variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptide can be recovered from a cell suspension if desired. As used<br>
herein, "recovered" means that the mutated polypeptide is removed from those<br>
components of a cell or culture medium in which it is present prior to the recovery<br>
process. The recovery process may include one or more refolding or purification steps.<br>
Variant Neublastin polypeptides can be constructed using any of several methods<br>
known in the art. One such method is site-directed mutagenesis, in which a specific<br>
nucleotide (or, if desired a small number of specific nucleotides) is changed in order to<br>
change a single amino acid (or, if desired, a small number of predetermined amino acid<br>
residues) in the encoded variant Neublastin polypeptide. Many site-directed mutagenesis<br>
kits are commercially available. One such kit is the "Transformer Site Directed<br>
Mutagenesis Kit" sold by Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA).<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
A variant Neublastin polypeptide can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of the polypeptide and one or<br>
more adjuvants, excipients, carriers, and/or diluents. Acceptable diluents, carriers and<br>
excipients typically do not adversely affect a recipient's homeostasis (e.g., electrolyte<br>
balance). Acceptable carriers include biocompatible, inert or bioabsorbable salts,<br>
buffering agents, oligo- or polysaccharides, polymers, viscosity-improving agents,<br>
preservatives and the like. One exemplary carrier is physiologic saline (0.15 M NaCl, pH<br>
7.0 to 7.4). Another exemplary carrier is 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium<br>
chloride. Further details on techniques for formulation and administration of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions can be found in, e.g., REMINGTON'S<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Maack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.).<br>
Administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing a variant Neublastin<br>
polypeptide can be systemic or local. Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated<br>
such that they are suitable for parenteral and/or non-parenteral administration. Specific<br>
administration modalities include subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal transdermal, intrathecal, oral, rectal, buccal, topical, nasal, ophthalmic,<br>
infra-articular, infra-arterial, sub-arachnoid, bronchial, lymphatic, vaginal, and<br>
infra-uterine administration.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently contain a sterile<br>
aqueous preparation of the variant Neublastin polypeptide, which preferably is isotonic<br>
with the blood of the recipient (e.g., physiological saline solution). Formulations may presented in unit-dose or multi-dose form.<br>
An exemplary formulation contains a variant Neublastin polypeptide described<br>
herein and the following buffer components: sodium succinate (e.g., 10 mM); Nad<br>
(e.g., 75 mM); and L-arginine (e.g., 100 mM).<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units<br>
such as capsules, cachets, tablets, or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount<br>
of the variant Neublastin polypeptide; or a suspension in an aqueous liquor or a<br>
non-aqueous liquid, such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion, or a draught.<br>
Therapeutically effective amounts of a pharmaceutical composition may be<br>
administered to a subject in need thereof in a dosage regimen ascertainable by one of skill<br>
in the art. For example, a composition can be administered to the subject, e.g.,<br>
systemically at a dosage from 0.01|j.g/kg to 1000 ug/kg body weight of the subject, per<br>
dose, hi another example, the dosage is from 1 ug/kg to 100 |J,g/kg body weight of the<br>
subject, per dose. In another example, the dosage is from 1 |J.g/kg to 30 ug/kg body<br>
weight of the subject, per dose, e.g., from 3 |ig/kg to 10 ug/kg body weight of the subject,<br>
per dose.<br>
In order to optimize therapeutic efficacy, a variant Neublastin polypeptide is first<br>
administered at different dosing regimens. The unit dose and regimen depend on factors<br>
that include, e.g., the species of mammal, its immune status, the body weight of the<br>
mammal. Typically, protein levels in tissue are monitored using appropriate screening<br>
assays as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to determine the efficacy of a given<br>
treatment regimen.<br>
The frequency of dosing for a variant Neublastin polypeptide is within the skills<br>
and clinical judgement of physicians. Typically, the administration regime is established<br>
by clinical trials which may establish optimal administration parameters. However, the<br>
practitioner may vary such administration regimes according to the subject's age, health,<br>
weight, sex and medical status. The frequency of dosing may also vary between acute<br>
and chronic treatments for neuropathy. In addition, the frequency of dosing may be<br>
varied depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
Variant Neublastin polypeptides are useful for modulating metabolism, growth,<br>
differentiation, or survival of a nerve or neuronal cell. In particular, variant Neublastin<br>

nodose ganglia; the vestibuloacoustic complex of the eighth cranial nerve; the<br>
ventrolateral pole of the maxillomandibular lobe of the trigeminal ganglion; and the<br>
mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus.<br>
In some embodiments, sensory and/or autonomic system neurons can be treated.<br>
In particular, nociceptive and mechanoreceptive neurons can be treated, more particularly<br>
A-delta fiber, C-fiber and A-beta fiber neurons. In addition, sympathetic and<br>
parasympathetic neurons of the autonomic system can be treated.<br>
In some embodiments, motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis ("ALS") and spinal muscular atrophy can be treated. In other embodiments, the<br>
variant Neublastin polypeptides can be used to enhance nerve recovery following<br>
traumatic injury. Alternatively, or in addition, a nerve guidance channel with a matrix<br>
containing polymer-conjugated Neublastin polypeptides, or fusion or conjugates of<br>
mutated Neublastin polypeptides can be used. Such nerve guidance channels are<br>

detail in the following subsections.<br>
1. Treatment of Neuropathic Pain<br>
The variant Neublastin polypeptides disclosed herein (and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising same) can be used in methods for treating neuropathic pain in a<br>
subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptide either alone, or by also administering to the subject an effective<br>
amount of an analgesia-inducing compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
opioids, anti-arrhythmics, topical analgesics, local anaesthetics, anticonvulsants,<br>

embodiment, the analgesia-inducing compound is gabapentin<br>
((l-aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid) orpregabalin (S-(+)-4-amino-3-<br>
(2-methylpropyl) butanoic acid).<br>
The variant Neublastin polypeptides disclosed herein (and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising same) can be used in the treatment of pain associated with<br>
peripheral neuropathies. Among the peripheral neuropathies which can be treated are<br>
trauma-induced neuropathies, e.g., those caused by physical injury or disease state,<br>
physical damage to the brain, physical damage to the spinal cord, stroke associated with<br>
brain damage, and neurological disorders related to neurodegeneration.<br>
The variant Neublastin polypeptides disclosed herein (and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising same) can be used in the treatment of a number of peripheral<br>
neuropathies, including: (a) trauma-induced neuropathies, (b) chemotherapy-induced<br>
neuropathies, (c) toxin-induced neuropathies (including but not limited to neuropathies<br>

not limited to renal insufficiency and hypothyroidism), (m) infectious and viral<br>
neuropathies (including but not limited to neuropathic pain associated with leprosy, Lyme<br>
disease, neuropathic pain associated with infection by a virus, particularly a virus selected<br>
from the group consisting of a herpes virus (e.g. herpes zoster which may lead to postherpetic<br>
neuralgia), a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and a papilloma virus), (n)<br>
auto-immune neuropathies (including but not limited to Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic<br>

Neuropathic pain may be manifested as allodynia, hyperalgesia, spontaneous pain or<br>
phantom pain.<br>
2. Treatment of Tactile Allodynia<br>
The variant Neublastin polypeptides disclosed herein (and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising same) can be used in the treatment of tactile allodynia in a<br>
subject. The term "tactile allodynia" typically refers to the condition in a subject where<br>
pain is evoked by stimulation of the skin (e.g. touch) that is normally innocuous.<br>
In some embodiments, tactile allodynia is treated by administering to the subject a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount of a variant Neublastin polypeptide. In a related<br>
embodiment, tactile allodynia may be treated by administering to a subject an effective<br>
amount of a variant Neublastin polypeptide either alone, or by administering to the<br>
subject an effective amount of a variant Neublastin polypeptide with an effective amount<br>
of an analgesia-inducing compound selected from the group consisting of opioids, antiarrhythmics,<br>
topical analgesics, local anaesthetics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants,<br>
corticosteroids and NSAIDS. In one embodiment, the analgesia-inducing compound is<br>
an anticonvulsant In another preferred embodiment, the analgesia-inducing compound is<br>
gabapentin ((l-aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid) or pregabalin (S-(+)-4-amino-3-<br>
(2-methylpropyl)butanoic acid).<br>
In some embodiments, a variant Neublastin polypeptide is administered in<br>
association with a therapeutic agent, including but not limited to an anti-cancer agent or<br>
an anti-viral agent. Anti-cancer agents include, but are not limited to, taxol, taxotere,<br>
cisplatin, nocodazole, vincristine, vindesine and vinblastine. Anti-viral agents include,<br>
but are not limited to, ddl, DDC, d4T, foscamet, dapsone, metronidazole, and isoniazid.<br>
3. Treatment for Reduction of Loss of Pain Sensitivity<br>
In another embodiment, variant Neublastin polypeptides disclosed herein (and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising same) can be used in a method for reducing the<br>
loss of pain sensitivity in a subject afflicted with a neuropathy. In one embodiment, the<br>
neuropathy is diabetic neuropathy. In some embodiments, the loss of pain sensitivity is a<br>
loss in thermal pain sensitivity. This methods include both prophylactic and therapeutic<br>
treatment.<br>
hi prophylactic treatment, a variant Neublastin polypeptide is administered to a<br>
subject at risk of developing loss of pain sensitivity (such a subject would be expected to<br>
be a subject with an early stage neuropathy). The treatment with a variant Neublastin<br>
polypeptide under such circumstances would serve to treat at-risk patients preventively.<br>
In therapeutic treatment, a variant Neublastin polypeptide is administered to a<br>
subject who has experienced loss of pain sensitivity as a result of affliction with a<br>
neuropathy (such a subject would be expected to be a subject with a late stage<br>
neuropathy). The treatment with a variant Neublastin polypeptide under such<br>
circumstances would serve to rescue appropriate pain sensitivity in the subject.<br>
4. Treatment of Viral Infections and Viral-Associated Neuropathies<br>
Prophylactic treatment of infectious and viral neuropathies is contemplated.<br>
Prophylactic treatment is indicated after determination of viral infection and before onset<br>
of neuropathic pain. During treatment, a variant Neublastin polypeptide is administered<br>
to prevent appearance of neuropathic pain including but not limited to neuropathic pain<br>
associated with leprosy, Lyme disease, neuropathic pain associated with infection by a<br>
virus, particularly a virus selected from the group consisting of a herpes virus (and more<br>
particularly by a herpes zoster virus, which may lead to post-herpetic neuralgia), a human<br>
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and a papilloma virus), hi an alternative embodiment, a<br>
variant Neublastin polypeptide is administered to reduce the severity of neuropathic pain,<br>
should it appear.<br>
Symptoms of acute viral infection often include the appearance of a rash. Other<br>
symptoms include, for example, the development of persistent pain in the affected area of<br>
the body, which is a common complication of a herpes zoster infection (shingles). Postherpetic<br>
neuralgia can last for a month or more, and may appear several months after any<br>
rash-like symptoms have disappeared.<br>
5. Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy<br>
Prophylactic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is contemplated.<br>
Prophylactic treatment of diabetic neuropathies would commence after determination of<br>
the initial diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes-associated symptoms and before onset of<br>
neuropathic pain. Prophylactic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy may also<br>
commence upon determining that a subject is at risk for developing diabetes or diabetesassociated<br>
symptoms. During treatment, a variant Neublastin polypeptide is administered<br>
to prevent appearance of neuropathic pain. In an alternative embodiment, a variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptide is administered to reduce the severity of neuropathic pain that has<br>
already appeared.<br>
6. Treatment of Nervous System Disorders<br>
The variant Neublastin polypeptides disclosed herein (and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising same) can be used in the treatment or prevention of a nervous<br>
system disorder in a subject (such as a human), by administering to a subject in need<br>
thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a variant Neublastin polypeptide, a<br>
composition containing a variant Neublastin polypeptide, or a complex that includes a<br>
stable, aqueous soluble conjugated variant Neublastin polypeptide coupled to a<br>
polyalkylene moiety such as, e.g., PEG.<br>
The nervous system disorder can be a peripheral nervous system disorder, such as<br>
a peripheral neuropathy or a neuropathic pain syndrome. Humans are preferred subjects<br>
for treatment.<br>
A variant Neublastin polypeptide is useful for treating a defect in a neuron,<br>
including without limitation lesioned neurons and traumatized neurons. Peripheral<br>
nerves that experience trauma include, but are not limited to, nerves of the medulla or of<br>
the spinal cord. Variant Neublastin polypeptides are useful in the treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative disease, e.g., cerebral ischemic neuronal damage; neuropathy, e.g.,<br>
peripheral neuropathy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease,<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Such variant Neublastin polypeptides can be used in<br>
the treatment of impaired memory, e.g., memory impairment associated with dementia.<br>
The following are examples of the practice of the invention. They are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Design and Synthesis of Variant Neublastin Polypeptides<br>
Human Neublastin was crystallized and its structure revealed a triad of sulfate<br>
ions interacting with the following four Neublastin residues in close proximity to each<br>
other: Argl4, Arg48, Arg49, and ArgSl. Based upon the presence of this triad and their<br>
relative spacing to one another, it was postulated that this region of Neublastin could be a<br>
potential heparin sulfate-binding domain. Subsequently, a previously solved heparin<br>
sulfate structure was docked (in-silico) to Neublastin at the site of the sulfate triad.<br>
Heparin sulfate fit precisely in this position, suggesting that this region within Neublastin<br>
has potential for heparin sulfate binding.<br>
The Neublastin crystallization data also revealed that the following amino acid<br>
residues provide supplementary interactions with either the triad of sulfate ions or with<br>
21<br>
one or more of three other sulfate ions that interact with Neublastin: Ser 46, Ser 73, Gly<br>
72, Arg 39, Gin 21, Ser 20, Arg 68, Arg 33, His 32, and Val 94. In addition to the sulfate<br>
binding sites revealed by the crystal structure, Neublastin contains a heparin sulfate<br>
binding site consensus sequence (GPGSRAR) at residues 3-9 at its N-terminus. This<br>
region was unstructured in the crystal structure but may become ordered upon binding<br>
glycosaminoglycans. The region is likely to be close in space to the three sulfate cluster<br>
observed in the crystal structure (Argl4 contributes to the heparin-binding site that is<br>
mainly centered in the hinge region of the protein).<br>
To investigate the biological relevance of the potential heparin sulfate-binding<br>
domain, three individual single amino acid residue substitutions were made within the<br>
mature 113 amino acid human Neublastin (SEQ ID NO: 1). The arginine residues at each<br>
of position 48 (variant named "Arg48E"; SEQ ID N0:2), position 49 (variant named<br>
"Arg49E"; SEQ ID NO:3), and position 51 (variant named "Arg51E"; SEQ ID NO:4)<br>
were replaced by glutamate (i.e., three different single amino acid variant constructs were<br>
prepared) with the intention of changing the residue charge from one that would attract<br>
sulfate to one that would repel, and to potentially stabilize surrounding arginine residues.<br>
Proteins were refolded and purified from E. coli inclusion bodies (see WO 04/069176).<br>
Each Neublastin variant was subjected to analysis to verify structural integrity and<br>
confirm the correct residue substitution. All three mutants were structurally comparable<br>
to the wild-type human Neublastin.<br>
Example 2: Cationic and Heparin Sepharose Chromatography<br>
The variant Neublastin polypeptides were subjected to further biochemical<br>
analysis to determine the effect each mutation had on heparin binding. Heparin<br>
Sepharose and cationic chromatography were both employed. Since wild-type human<br>
Neublastin is a basic protein with an apparent pi of 11.31, Neublastin binds efficiently to<br>
cationic-based resins. A single conversion of arginine to glutamate decreases the<br>
apparent pi to 10.88. However, this lower pi was not expected to dramatically alter<br>
cationic resin-binding nor was it expected to alter the elution profile of the mutants<br>
compared to that of the wild-type control.<br>
Each of the mutants (along with the wild-type Neublastin control) was subjected<br>
to cationic chromatography. The samples were loaded onto resin in buffer containing<br>
5 mM phosphate pH 6.5 and 150 mM sodium chloride followed by elution with a linear<br>
salt gradient starting at 150 mM and ending with 1M sodium chloride. Wild-type<br>
Neublastin eluted at ~800 mM sodium chloride (Fig. 2A; Peak D), whereas each of the<br>
three mutants eluted within a salt range of approximately 500 mM, thus reflecting their<br>
lower pi. Arg49E and Arg5 IE (Fig. 2A; Peaks B and C) eluted with slightly higher salt<br>
than was required to elute Arg48E (Fig. 2A; Peak A) (520 mM vs 490 mM, respectively).<br>
This difference suggested that Arg48 is more surface accessible and contributes more to<br>
cationic binding than that of the other two mutations.<br>
To determine whether the Arg-to-Glu substitutions had an effect on heparin<br>
binding, each of the three mutants (along with wild-type human Neublastin) was<br>
subjected to Heparin Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 2B). Binding and elution<br>
conditions were similar to those used for cationic chromatography. However, the<br>
observed elution profile was significantly different from the cationic resin elution profile.<br>
Wild-type Neublastin eluted at approximately 720 mM sodium chloride (Fig. 2B;<br>
Peak H) whereas ArgSlE, Arg49E, and Arg48E eluted at 570 mM (Fig. 2B; Peak G),<br>
510 mM (Fig. 2B; Peak F), and 450 mM (Fig. 2B; Peak E) sodium chloride, respectively.<br>
Arg48E appeared to have a particularly dramatic effect on heparin binding. Taken<br>
together, these chromatography profiles suggested that each mutation decreases<br>
Neublastin's apparent affinity for heparin.<br>
Example 3: Anionic Chromatographv •<br>
At standard pH conditions of 6.5 and a sodium chloride concentration of 150 mM,<br>
Neublastin does not bind to anionic resins. In contrast, heparin sulfate does bind to<br>
anionic resins under these same conditions.<br>
When Neublastin was pre-mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio with 16-kDa-heparin sulfate<br>
and applied to an anionic matrix using the above conditions, Neublastin bound and eluted<br>
with 600 mM sodium chloride (Fig. 3B, lanes marked "FT"), suggesting that Neublastin<br>
was binding the anionic matrix through its interaction with heparin sulfate. In the<br>
absence of heparin, Neublastin did not bind to the anionic resin (Fig. 3 A, lanes marked<br>
"FT") and no Neublastin eluted with 600 mM sodium chloride (Fig. 3A, lanes marked<br>
"Elution"). These data provide further evidence of Neublastin's ability to bind to<br>
heparin.<br>
Example 4: Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell Binding Studies<br>
Neublastin has been shown previously to bind non-specifically to the surface of<br>
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. A Neublastin CHO cell-binding assay was<br>
established to determine whether this interaction is mediated, at least in part, through<br>
Neublastin's binding to cell surface heparin sulfate molecules.<br>
Wild-type human Neublastin (40 ug) or the Arg48E mutant was pre-mixed with<br>
CHO cells (106 cells) at a cell density which completely binds both Neublastin forms<br>
along with increasing amounts of 16 kDa heparin sulfate and incubated at 37°C for<br>
4 hours. Following incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and remaining<br>
non-bound Neublastin in the supernatant was subjected to SDS/PAGE analysis. After<br>
quantification of each protein band by densitometry, the resulting optical density value<br>
was plotted against the heparin concentration in each sample (Fig. 4).<br>
At the two lower heparin concentrations, both the wild type and the mutant<br>
Neublastin forms had equal amounts of protein identified in the supernatant. However,<br>
as the heparin concentration increased to 0.5 ug/ml and higher, more wild-type<br>
Neublastin was identified in the supernatant than that of the Arg48E mutant. This<br>
observation suggested that heparin can compete with cell surface-bound heparin for wildtype<br>
Neublastin binding (i.e., binding of heparin to wild-type Neublastin results in its<br>
removal from the cell surface), whereas heparin cannot as readily compete off the<br>
Arg48E mutant. At the highest heparin concentration (50 ug/ml), the Arg48E mutant<br>
began to elute off the cell surface, suggesting an ionic interaction between heparin and<br>
the Arg48E mutant might be responsible for this observation.<br>
Example 5: Heparin Binding of Wild Type Neublastin and Variant Neublastin<br>
Polyp eptides<br>
To further investigate the role of the identified arginine triad as a heparin-binding<br>
site of Neublastin, a heparin binding ELISA was established. In brief, an anti-Neublastin<br>
monoclonal antibody was coated onto a 96-well plate, followed by washing and the<br>
addition of one of the Neublastin forms. Biotinylated heparin was then added to the<br>
plate. Following an additional wash step, the Neublastin/Heparin complex was identified<br>
using a Strepavidin-HRP conjugate with a chemiluminescent substrate. This heparinbinding<br>
ELISA was used to compare wild type human Neublastin 113 amino acid (SEQ<br>
ID NO:1) and 104 amino acid (amino acids 10-113 of SEQ ED NO:1) forms to variant<br>
Neublastin polypeptides containing a single amino acid substitution (Arg48E, Arg49E,<br>
and ArgSlE; SEQ ID NOS:2-4) as well as a double substitution (Arg48, 49E; SEQ ID<br>
NO:5).<br>
Both wild-type forms of Neublastin bound heparin with an EC50 of ~1 ng/ml<br>
heparin (Fig. 5). Arg49E and ArgSlE bound less efficiently, with an apparent EC50 of<br>
~10ng/ml, but maximum binding remained the same (Fig. 5). Of the three single point<br>
mutations, Arg48E had the most dramatic effect on heparin binding, with an apparent<br>
EC50 of ~ 100 ng/ml, but still achieved the same maximum heparin binding value when<br>
compared to the unmodified Neublastin forms (Fig. 5). The Arg48E mutant was thus one<br>
hundred fold less efficient in binding heparin as compared to the unmodified Neublastin<br>
forms and ten fold less efficient as compared to the other single substitution mutants.<br>
When both Arg48 and Arg49 were substituted with glutamate, heparin binding was<br>
almost eliminated, resulting in a seven-fold decrease in maximum heparin binding, but<br>
the EC50 remained within range of the single point mutants. These results suggest that<br>
Arg48 plays an important role in heparin binding due to its central location in the putative<br>
heparin-binding site.<br>
Example 6: Kinase Receptor Activation Analysis of Wild-Type Neublastin and Heparin<br>
Binding Mutants<br>
To determine whether heparin-binding site mutations have an effect on Neublastin<br>
receptor signaling in a cell-based bioassay, mutant Neublastin forms along with the wildtype<br>
Neublastin were subjected to Kinase Receptor Activation (ORA) analysis.<br>
Each of the single Arg-to-Glu substitution mutants appeared identical to the<br>
unmodified control with respect to KIRA activity, suggesting that these mutants are<br>
structurally similar to the wild-type and are capable of activating the Neublastin receptor<br>
and signaling cascade (Fig. 6). Furthermore, these data suggest that heparin binding to<br>
Neublastin may not be required for receptor activation.<br>
When the Arg48,49E double mutant (SEQ ID N0:5; 113 amino acid form) was<br>
subjected to KIRA analysis, its apparent EC50 was shifted to the left by approximately<br>
one order of magnitude with an increase in its maximum receptor activation when<br>
compared with the wild-type human Neublastin control (Fig. 7A). Similarly, the<br>
Arg48,49B double mutant (SEQ ED NO:7; 104 amino acid form) also exhibited increased<br>
potency as compared to wild-type Neublastin (Fig. 7B). Each of the Arg48,51E and<br>
Arg49,51E double mutants (SEQ ID NO:9 and SEQ ID NO:8, respectively; 113 amino<br>
acid forms) appeared similar to the unmodified Neublastin control with respect to KIRA<br>
activity (Fig. 7B).<br>
Example 7: Ternary Complex Analysis<br>
Wild-type human Neublastin and each of the heparin mutants were subjected to<br>
ternary complex analysis using two slightly different protocols. The first protocol<br>
combined Neublastin's receptor components (GFRalphaS and RET) along with<br>
Neublastin in a pool before addition to an ELISA plate coated with capture antibody<br>
(Fig. 8). The second protocol added these components sequentially to an ELISA plate<br>
with GFRalphaS added first, followed by Neublastin, and then RET (Fig. 9).<br>
When the components were added together as a pool, maximum binding was<br>
achieved with both Arg48E and Arg48,49E, suggesting that these Neublastin forms have<br>
the highest affinity for their receptor. Wild-type Neublastin appeared to bind with a<br>
similar affinity to that of the Arg49E mutant, whereas the ArgSlE and a triple mutant<br>
(Arg48, 49 and 51 all substituted to glutamate) demonstrated the weakest receptor<br>
binding.<br>
When the receptor components were added sequentially, Arg48E showed the best<br>
receptor binding. However under these conditions, the double mutant weakly bound to its<br>
receptor with an affinity that appeared similar to the ArgSlE mutant. Arg49E and wildtype<br>
Neublastin had an affinity for the receptor that was midway between the observed<br>
maximum and minimum binding. The triple mutant did not bind under these conditions.<br>
Overall, these data suggest that Arg48 plays a pivotal role in affecting Neublastin's<br>
affinity for its receptor.<br>
Example 8: Near and Far UV CD Analysis<br>
To further investigate the effects of the double mutations on Neublastin's<br>
secondary and tertiary structure, the Arg48,49E double mutant was subjected to both<br>
Near and Far UV CD analysis. Although subtle differences were detected in the<br>
secondary and tertiary structures, the conformation of the double mutant was very close<br>
to that of the wild-type Neublastin.<br>
Example 9: Pharmacokinetic Analysis of the Neublastin Arg48. 49E Double Mutant<br>
Human Neublastin exhibits poor pharmacokmetics (PK) when administered to<br>
rats intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC), with an overall bioavailability of less<br>
than 1%. Heparin-based clearance may be one of the reasons for this low bioavailability.<br>
To determine whether heparin-based clearance participates in human Neublastin's rapid<br>
clearance from the rat, the Arg48,49E double mutant (along with the wild-type control)<br>
was subjected to PK analysis.<br>
Both forms were administered separately in rats at 7 mg/kg SC. Serum samples<br>
were collected starting at 1 hour, completed at 96 hours, and analyzed for Neublastin<br>
(Fig. 10). The observed area under the curve (AUC) for wild-type Neublastin was ~109<br>
whereas the observed AUC for the double mutant was 20,145. This represented a 185-<br>
fold increase in AUC for the double mutant (compared to wild-type Neublastin) and a<br>
significant increase in serum exposure.<br>
Both the wild type and double mutant Neublastin were also subjected to PK<br>
analysis following IV administration (1 mg/kg). The initial plasma concentration of the<br>
double mutant was approximately six-fold higher (diamonds) than that of the wild-type<br>
control (squares) at five minutes following injection but quickly approached wild type<br>
levels within one hour (Fig. 11). These data suggest that the double mutation in<br>
Neublastin, aids in increasing serum exposure but does not affect the overall clearance<br>
rate.<br>
27<br>
Taken together with the SC observation, heparin-binding appears to be especially<br>
relevant following SC administration, perhaps resulting in a depot-like effect. Once<br>
Neublastin enters circulation, the rate at which the double mutant and wild type<br>
molecules are cleared is approximately the same.<br>
To address the rate at which Neublastin is cleared from circulation in the rat, both<br>
the wild type and double mutant forms of Neublastin were PEGylated with 10 kDa PEG<br>
using SPA-based coupling chemistry. Since Neublastin is a homo-dimer with no native<br>
lysine residues, the 10-kDa moieties specifically labeled the amino terminus of each<br>
monomer. 2X1 OK PEGylated human double mutant neublastin was purified to<br>
homogeneity, and subjected to structural and biological analysis prior to PK analysis.<br>
2X10K PEG Arg48,49E double mutant was injected either IV (1 mg/kg) or SC (7<br>
mg/kg) into rats and serum collected at various time points for analysis. Following IV<br>
administration, 2X1 OK PEG double mutant achieved the theoretical Cmax of 10 ug/ml<br>
(diamonds) with typical alpha and beta phases (Fig. 12). SC administration of the<br>
PEGylated double mutant demonstrated a Cmax of 40 ng/ml at 24 hours injection<br>
(Fig. 12). Once the drug reached circulation, the apparent rate of clearance paralleled<br>
that of IV dose. Bioavailability of this construct was approximately 10% compared to<br>
less than 1% for the non-PEGylated or PEGylated wild type human Neublastin.<br>
Example 10: Expression of a Neublastin Heparin-Binding Mutant in Chinese Hamster<br>
Ovary Cells<br>
Plasmid constructs encoding wild type and mutant Neublastin were expressed in<br>
CHO cells and the amount of secreted soluble protein was measured by ELISA. The<br>
plasmid constructs used in these experiments encoded a fusion protein containing the<br>
human growth hormone signal peptide (SigPep) (with or without an intron included in the<br>
plasmid) fused to (i) the carboxy terminal 104 amino acids of wild type human<br>
Neublastin, or (ii) the Arg48,49E double mutant (104 amino acid form).<br>
The following are the amino acid sequences of the Neublastin fusion proteins<br>
used in these experiments. The Neublastin sequences are in upper case type. The human<br>
growth hormone signal peptide sequences are in lower case type. The junction of the<br>
signal peptide and Neublastin sequences is indicated with a carat (A). The amino acids at<br>
positions 48 and 49 are underlined.<br>

CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding each of the foregoing forms<br>
of Neublastin and cultured in 384-well plates. After several weeks, wells that contained<br>
growing cells were transferred to fresh 96-well culture plates. Conditioned medium was<br>
analyzed by ELISA to measure the titer of soluble Neublastin. The cumulative<br>
absorbance data for each plasmid tested (mean value with one standard deviation as error<br>
bars) was detected.<br>
Transfection of CHO cells with plasmids encoding the Arg48,49E double mutant<br>
resulted in a significantly increased number of cell lines exhibiting high expression levels<br>
of recombinant protein, as compared to cells transfected with plasmids encoding wild<br>
type Neublastin (Fig. 13).<br>
The leading cell lines from each transfection were further expanded. Fixed<br>
numbers of cells were cultured for three days and total cell count, viability, and titer were<br>
determined. The titers of Neublastin expressed from the leading Arg48,49E double<br>
mutant cell lines were roughly five-fold greater than those of a leading wild type<br>
Neublastin cell line (Fig. 14).<br>
