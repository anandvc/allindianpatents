				<td>AN INSULATING CONCRETE FORM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 60/408.859, entitled 'Insulated Concrete Form and Welded Wire Form Tie*, filed on September<br>
5, 2002, and the specification thereof is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention (Technical Field):<br>
The present invention relates to a horizontally reversible insulating concrete form with<br>
opposing panels connected by wire ties, preferably welded wire ties with a metal sheet attachment<br>
stud, used to make concrete structures.<br>
Description of Related Art:<br>
Traditional concrete walls in building construction are generally made by setting up two<br>
parallel form walls and pouring concrete into the space between the forms. After the concrete<br>
hardens, the builder then removes the forms, leaving the cured concrete wall.<br>
This common prior art technique has significant drawbacks. The resulting wall is not<br>
insulated, and significant labor is required to remove the forms after the concrete cures or hardens.<br>
Techniques have developed for forming modular concrete walls that use a foam insulating<br>
form material, generally referred to as "insulating concrete forms* or by the acronym "ICF". Using<br>
modular forms, which are available in different sizes, walls are set up. Most insulating concrete<br>
forms are composed of two parallel panels, forming an exterior and interior wall panel, with ties,<br>
bridges or other connecting components holding the two panels in place relative to each other while<br>
concrete is poured into the cavity between the panels. The insulating form panels remain in place<br>
after the concrete cures. Thus no labor is required to either remove forms or add insulation,<br>
resulting in substantial efficiency. In most cases, the insulation of the form provides adequate<br>
insulation for the building, so that no additional insulation is required.<br>
Insulating concrete forms are manufactured from a polymeric material, often polyurethane or<br>
polystyrene, which is expanded and formed within a mold to yield a rigid, low-density foamed plastic<br><br>
form having vertical and/or horizontal cavities to be filled with wet concrete. U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,552,076, entitled Concrete Form to Gregori, and U.S. Patent No. 3,788.020, entitled Foamed<br>
Plastic Concrete Form With Fire Resistant Tension Member, also to Gregori, are two early patents<br>
that both teach methods whereby polystyrene foam is molded to yield a concrete form.<br>
The construction industry has incorporated several means of attaching finishing materials to<br>
the outer sides of these molded construction forms after the concrete within the cavities has set.<br>
One such method has been to glue the paneling, sheetrock, or other suitable finishing materials to<br>
the outer surfaces of the completed form. Additionally, outer finishing materials may be rigidly<br>
attached using a penetrating device through the outer molded form to the cured concrete or other<br>
building material inside the form. Another method to attach finishing materials is to glue or nail<br>
furring strips on the outer surfaces of the forms. Gluing the furring strips to the foam forms require<br>
construction adhesive, and nailing the furring strips or the finishing materials to the outer sides of the<br>
forms require that special concrete nails be used. The application of these concrete nails,<br>
moreover, must be accomplished at a critical time during the curing of the concrete. Then, the<br>
finishing materials are nailed or screwed onto the furring strips.<br>
Another approach to concrete forms is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,223,501, entitled<br>
Concrete Form, to DeLozier. This patent teaches a method whereby a one piece transverse<br>
connecting member is embedded in the polystyrene concrete form taught in the Gregori patent. The<br>
connecting member has attachment flanges extending at right angles which extend near the outer<br>
surfaces of the form.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,879,855 entitled Attachment and Reinforcement Member for Molded<br>
Construction Forms, to Berrenberg, discloses an attachment and reinforcement tie for molded<br>
construction forms with a central portion of expanded steel in which the ends are bent to<br>
accommodate covering strips of solid galvanized steel. The tie is embedded in a molded<br>
construction form during the form's manufacture. The strips of the solid galvanized steel extend to<br>
the outer surfaces of the form and provide attachment surfaces while the central portion of<br>
expanded steel web reinforces the form and connects the two panels.<br>
It is known to have a groove on one end of both panels in an ICF, with a corresponding<br>
tongue on the other end of the panels, such that two forms may be joined together in a horizontal<br>
plane by means of a tongue and groove attachment. Among other patents, U.S. Patent Nos.<br><br>
3,552,076. 3.788,020, 4.223.501, 4,698,947, 4,879,855. 5,459.871. 5,465.542, and 5,596,855<br>
disclose forms of this type. Other patents disclose a shiplap joint on the ends of both panels in an<br>
ICF. as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,516.372 and 5,568,710. However, all such forms can only<br>
be interconnected in a horizontal dimension in a specific direction, and the forms are not reversible.<br>
While many forms utilize a plastic tie, there are a few forms which utilize a metal tie, such as<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,879.855 and 5,568,710, which employ an expanded metal tie, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,223,501 and 5,596,855, which employ perforated metal plates with comparatively small openings,<br>
and U.S. Patent No. 4,967,528, which employs a metal wire requiring an external clip to fasten the<br>
wire to an external plate. However, all such forms have significant limitations. With most, the<br>
openings through the tie are sufficiently small so as to impede the free flow of concrete during<br>
pouring. With forms such as the '528 form, multiple parts are required, and the tie is limited to<br>
providing connection at the top and bottom of the 1orm, and thus provides inadequate strength for<br>
many form heights.<br>
There remains a need in the industry for an insulated concrete form with superior strength<br>
that provides minimal obstruction to concrete flow when pouring. In general, having a form with ties<br>
on close centers, such as every six or twelve inches, is preferable. However, if the tie component<br>
can obstruct the flow of concrete when being poured, void or vacant spots can result which can<br>
seriously weaken the resulting wall. There similarly remains a need in the industry for a form which<br>
is reversible such that it may be assembled in a horizontal dimension in any orientation, with no<br>
"inside" or "outside" orientation to the form.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides an insulating concrete form. In one preferred embodiment, the form<br>
includes two opposing panels of a polymeric material, with the ends of each panel including both a<br>
tongue and groove positioned such that the forms are reversible in a horizontal orientation. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the opposing panels are joined together by a plurality of welded wire<br>
ties, with both horizontal and vertical members, the horizontal members having a right angle bend at<br>
either end, with a metal attachment stud disposed within the right angle bend, the right angle bends<br>
and metal attachment studs being within the structures of the opposing panels.<br>
The invention thus provides in one embodiment an insulating concrete form with first and<br>
second substantially opposing panels, each panel having a top surface, bottom surface, first end<br><br>
surface, second end surface, an exterior surface defining a wall and an interior surface for receiving<br>
concrete. The opposing panels are interconnected by at least two ties, each tie having a plurality of<br>
horizontal wires and a plurality of vertical wires, arrayed such that each horizontal wire in a tie<br>
touches and is fixed to each vertical wire in the tie.<br>
The tie further includes at least three parallel horizontal wires arranged in a single plane, the<br>
wires spaced distances apart such that the total distance from the bottom-most horizontal wire to the<br>
top-most horizontal wire is less than the height of the two opposing panels, with each wire being of a<br>
length greater than the distance between the exterior surfaces of the two opposing panels, and with<br>
an equidistant right angle on each end of each horizontal wire, positioned such that each right angle<br>
bend is disposed between the exterior surface and the interior surface of a panel. There are also<br>
provided at least three parallel vertical wires arranged in a single plane, the wires spaced apart and<br>
arranged so as to be disposed within a distance less than the distance between the right angle<br>
bends on each end of the horizontal wires, with each wire being of a length at least equal to the total<br>
distance from the bottom-most horizontal wire to the top-most horizontal wire. The horizontal wires<br>
and vertical wires are disposed such that each horizontal wire touches and forms a right angle<br>
intersection with all vertical wires, and each vertical wire touches and forms a right angle intersection<br>
with all horizontal wires, with the wires being fixed one to the other at each intersection. A metal<br>
sheet is disposed within the interior of right angle on each end of the horizontal wires, with at least a<br>
portion of the metal sheet being substantially parallel to the exterior surface of the panel wherein<br>
such right angle is disposed. Each metal sheet is in contact with the each horizontal wire and fixed<br>
thereto. In a preferred embodiment, the wires are fixed at each intersection by means that includes<br>
a weld, and further the metal sheet is fixed to each horizontal wire by means that include at least<br>
one weld.<br>
In the tie, each vertical wire can include a semicircular bend at the intersection with each<br>
horizontal wire, the circle defined by the semicircular bend having a radius approximately equal to<br>
the diameter of the horizontal wire. In this way the horizontal wires and vertical wires are<br>
substantially co-planar within the plane defined between the right angles on each end of the<br>
horizontal wires.<br>
In one embodiment, the horizontal wires are spaced distances apart such that the total<br>
distance from the bottom-most horizontal wire to the top-most horizontal wire is between about 75%<br><br>
and about 95% of the height of the two opposing panels. The vertical wires are of a length between<br>
about 100% and about 110% of the total distance from the bottom-most horizontal wire to the top-<br>
most horizontal wire.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a portion of the metal sheet, and preferably the larger part of the<br>
metal sheet, is substantially perpendicular to the exterior surface of the panel wherein such right<br>
angle is disposed. In this way the metal sheet forms an attachment stud for attaching wall coverings<br>
and other structures by means of screws.<br>
In the form, the first end surface and second end surface of the first panel and second panel<br>
have both a tongue and groove, disposed such that on the first end surface of the first panel the<br>
tongue is proximal the exterior surface and the groove proximal the interior surface and on the<br>
second end surface of the first panel the groove is proximal the exterior surface and the tongue<br>
proximal the interior surface. On the first end surface of the second panel the groove is proximal the<br>
exterior surface and the tongue proximal the interior surface and on the second end surface of the<br>
second panel the tongue is proximal the exterior surface and the groove proximal the interior<br>
surface. The panels are disposed such that the first end surface of the first panel opposes the first<br>
end surface of the second panel and the second end surface of the first panel opposes the second<br>
end surface of the second panel. By use of this structure two or more forms may be horizontally<br>
positioned and interlocked to form a planar surface by means of a joint formed by both a tongue and<br>
a groove on each panel of one form interconnecting with a groove and a tongue on each panel of<br>
another form, the forms being reversibly connectable such that the first end surface of the first and<br>
second panels of one form may be joined with either the first end surface or the second end surface<br>
of the first and second panels of another form.<br>
The top surface of both the first and second panel can include either a tongue or a groove,<br>
with the bottom surface of the first and second panel having the complementary tongue or groove.<br>
In this way two or more forms may be vertically stacked and interlocked to form a planar surface by<br>
means of a joint formed by a single tongue on each panel of one form interconnecting with a single<br>
groove on each panel of another form.<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide an ICF with a welded wire tie, the<br>
welded wire tie including at least three horizontal wire and three vertical wires, wherein each end of<br><br>
the horizontal wires are bent to form a right angle, with a steel strip disposed within the right angle,<br>
and forming an attachment stud for attaching wall coverings to the ICF.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an ICF which is reversible, such that<br>
either end of any form may be attached in a horizontal direction to either end of any other form.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an ICF which combines the advantages<br>
of a reversible form with a welded wire tie.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an ICF wherein each panel of the ICF<br>
includes both a tongue and a groove, thereby resulting in a more secure attachment between forms.<br>
A primary advantage of the present invention is that the wire ties provide increased structural<br>
strength between the opposing panels of the ICF.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that construction is simplified, in that there is<br>
no defined "inside" or "outside" on forms, and forms may be connected in a horizontal orientation<br>
such that either end of any ICF may be joined to either end of any other ICF.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG.1 depicts waffle grid form 10 of the invention, made of opposing panels 50 and 70 joined<br>
together by a plurality of metal ties 150. Panels 50 and 70 are preferably made of an insulating<br>
polymeric material, which is preferably a moldable polymeric material. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
panels 50 and 70 are made of an expanded polystyrene material, with a density of approximately<br>
1.5 lbs. per cubic foot. Waffle grid form 10 may be provided in a variety of widths; in one<br>
embodiment, the form has an overall width of about 9.25 inches, with a maximum concrete core<br>
width of about 6 inches; in another embodiment, the form has an overall width of about 11 inches,<br>
with a maximum concrete core width of about 8 inches; and in yet another embodiment, the form<br>
has an overall width of about 14 inches, with a maximum concrete core width of about 10 inches.<br>
Waffle grid form 10 may be any convenient length suitable for use in construction; in one<br>
embodiment the form has a length of 48 inches. Similarly, the height may be selected such as to be<br>
suitable for use in construction; in one embodiment the form has a height of 16 inches. The external<br>
surface of panels 50 and 70 are substantially planar, with vertical grooves designating the position<br>
within the form of the attachment stud, also called a furring strip, forming a part of metal tie 150.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts partially cutaway waffle grid form 10, which form is partially filled with concrete<br>
2, concrete 2 being a part of the completed wall, and not a part of form 10. FIG. 2 further depicts<br>
ties 150,150*. and 150" disposed within form 10. The ties 150,150', and 150" are formed from a<br>
suitable gauge of steel wire, such as 11 gauge minimum thickness wire, with a steel attachment stud<br>
disposed within the right angle bend of horizontal wires of the ties. The steel attachment stud is<br>
formed of a suitable thickness steel sheet, such as about 22 gauge steel. It may be seen that the<br>
steel attachment stud is disposed within the wall of panel 50, such that the steel attachment stud is a<br>
determined distance from the exterior of panel 50, such as about one-half inch. The ties 150,150',<br>
and 150", including the wires and steel attachment stud, may be galvanized. The interior of panels<br>
50, 70 are shaped such that the concrete, when introduced, forms a "waffle grid" pattern, comprising<br><br>
a series of concrete posts and beams, connected with solid concrete webs. For example, waffle grid<br>
form 10 with an overall width of about 14 inches provides 10 inch solid concrete posts, connected<br>
with 3 ½ inch solid concrete webs.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts partially cutaway flat panel form 20 of the invention, made of opposing panels<br>
100 and 120 joined together by a plurality of metal ties 152,152', and 152", which form is partially<br>
filled with concrete 2, concrete 2 being a part of the completed wall, and not a part of form 20. Flat<br>
panel form 20 may be provided in a variety of widths; in one embodiment, the form has an overall<br>
width of about 11 inches, with a concrete core width of about 6 inches; in another embodiment, the<br>
form has an overall width of about 13 inches, with a concrete core width of about 8 inches. Flat<br>
panel form 20 may be any convenient length suitable for use in construction; in one embodiment the<br>
form has a length of 48 inches. Similarly, the height may be selected such as to be suitable for use<br>
in construction; in one embodiment form 20 has a height of 24 inches. In another embodiment, form<br>
20 has a height of 12 inches.<br>
In forms 10, 20 of FIGS. 1 to 3, metal ties 150 or 152,152', and 152" are spaced on a<br>
standard and conventional distance on center; in one preferred embodiment of form 20, the metal<br>
ties are spaced every 6 inches on center. In a preferred embodiment of form 10, the metal ties are<br>
spaced every 12 inches on center. As shown in FIG 4, the distance "a" is a set and equal distance,<br>
such that the center lines of attachment studs of metal ties 150,150', and 150" are at an equal<br>
distance. As shown in FIG. 4, metal tie 150 may be reversed with respect to other metal ties, such<br>
as 150', so that the attachment studs remain on center without the metal tie 150 interfering with the<br>
tongue and groove members of form 10.<br>
In FIG. 4, the cavity wall 54 depicts that portion of form 10 defining a concrete post, upon<br>
introduction of concrete, and cavity wall 52 depicts that portion of form 10 defining a concrete web,<br>
again upon introduction of concrete. Panel 50 includes, at one end. planar area 66, which planar<br>
area abuts against a like area of another form when two or more forms are joined together in<br>
horizontal orientation. Tongue 58 is adjacent to and of reciprocal shape with groove 60, with<br>
adjacent thereto being second planar area 56. The opposite end of panel 50 includes the same<br>
elements, but arranged such that groove 62 is opposite tongue 58, both disposed on the exterior<br>
side of panel 50, and tongue 64 is opposite groove 60, both disposed on the interior side of panel<br>
50. Preferably grooves 60, 62 are of somewhat greater depth than the height of tongues 58, 64,<br><br>
such that the tongues fit within the grooves without binding or bottoming. In one embodiment, the<br>
grooves 60, 62 have a nominal depth of about .42 inches, while the tongues 58, 64 have a nominal<br>
height of about .37 inches. The width of grooves 60, 62 may be approximately equal to that of<br>
tongues 58, 64, thereby insuring a tight fit. Opposing panel 50 is panel 70, containing the same<br>
elements as panel 50. However, panel 70 is constructed such that groove 80 is the disposed on the<br>
exterior side of panel 70, while tongue 78 is adjacent thereto but disposed on the interior side of<br>
panel 70. Planar area 68 is provided on the exterior side of panel 70, while second planar area 76 is<br>
provided on the interior side. The opposite end of panel 70 includes the same elements, but<br>
arranged such that groove 82 is opposite tongue 78, both disposed on the interior side of panel 70,<br>
and tongue 84 is opposite groove 80, both disposed on the exterior side of panel 70. It may thus be<br>
seen that on form 10 panels 50, 70 are constructed such that at one end the outermost joining end<br>
element is a tongue and a groove, such as tongue 58 and groove 80, while at the opposite end the<br>
outermost joining end element position is reversed. In this way, the forms are reversible; that is,<br>
given a plurality of forms 10, such forms may be joined together in a horizontal dimension even<br>
though any single form is rotated 180°, and the forms still interconnect and join.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, wire tie 150 includes horizontal wire 160 bent to form a right angle, and<br>
disposed therein metal attachment stud 180'. The tie is positioned within the form such that the<br>
exterior surface of wire 160 is embedded within the polymeric substrate of panel 50 a suitable<br>
distance, such as about one-half inch, with the position of metal attachment stud 180' within the<br>
form indicated on the exterior of panel 50 by means of grooves 98, 98*. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the width of metal attachment stud 180', and thus the distance between grooves 98,<br>
98', is about VA inches.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts an end view of form 10, showing tongue 92 disposed on the top of panel 50,<br>
with groove 96 disposed on the bottom thereof, and corresponding tongue 90 and groove 94 on<br>
panel 70. Also shown is metal tie 150; it may thus be seen that metal tie 150 is a substantial portion<br>
of the height of panels 50, 70; in one preferred embodiment, panels 50, 70 have a height of 16<br>
inches, while tie 150 has a height of 13 inches. Tongues 58, 78 are shown, and have a radius curve<br>
on the top and bottom of each, to permit facile introduction into the grooves, such as grooves 60, 80,<br>
which grooves run the height of the available distance of panels 50, 70. Planar areas 66. 68 are co-<br>
planar one with the other, and are further optionally co-planar with second planar areas 56, 76,<br><br>
which are also co-planar one with the other. FIG. 5A depicts a detail of the top of panel 50, showing<br>
tongue 92 having a slight exterior curve on the top outer corner, thereby facilitating joining together<br>
two forms in a vertical orientation.<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 depict respectively right angle waffle grid form 12, for a right angle corner in a<br>
wall made of forms 10, and forty-five degree angle waffle grid form 14, for a forty-five degree angle<br>
in a wall made of forms 10. Panel 30 includes a right angle turn, while the interior is a "stub" panel<br>
32 which does not include a turn. Both panels 34, 36 include forty-five degree turns; as shown in<br>
FIG. 7, the tongues and grooves are arranged as in FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 8 depicts a side view of flat wall form 20, showing the exterior of panel 100. Grooves<br>
98, 98' mark, on the exterior of panel 100. the position within panel 100 of metal attachment stud<br>
180 forming a part of tie 150. The distances "a" are all equal in FIGS. 8 and 9, with the distances "b"<br>
plus "b" equal to "a", such that when two or more forms are positioned in a horizontal direction, the<br>
distances between the centerlines of any two adjacent areas defined by grooves 98, 98' are each<br>
the same, including the distance between centerlines on two adjacent forms. As shown in FIG. 9,<br>
form 20 includes panels 100 and 120. Tongue 108 is disposed on the exterior side of panel 100,<br>
with groove 110 on the interior side; on the opposite end, opposing tongue 108 is groove 112, and<br>
opposing groove 110 is tongue 114. Planar area 116 is opposite corresponding planar area 140,<br>
and second planar area 106 is disposed opposite corresponding second planar area 144. Opposing<br>
panel 120 is complementary, such that groove 130 is on the exterior side of such panel, with tongue<br>
128 on the interior, and opposing groove 130 is tongue 134, and opposing tongue 128 is groove<br>
132. Similarly, planar area 118 is opposite corresponding planar area 142, and second planar area<br>
126 is disposed opposite corresponding second planar area 146. Planar areas 116,118 are co-<br>
planar one with the other, and are further optionally co-planar with second planar areas 106,126,<br>
which are also co-planar one with the other. Panels 100,120 are joined together by means of metal<br>
ties 152,152', and 152"; as shown, tie 152" is reversed in orientation with respect to ties 152,152'.<br>
FIG. 10 depicts a detail of the end of panel 120, showing tongue 136 disposed on the top thereof,<br>
with groove 138 on the bottom. Also shown is tongue 128, with the top and bottom thereof having a<br>
radius curve, to thereby engage more easily with a corresponding groove. Groove 130 adjoins<br>
tongue 128. The top view shown in FIG. 14 further depicts the radius curve on the top of tongue<br>
108, and the relationship of the top of tongue 136 with respect to end groove 110. FIG. 11 is a<br><br>
cross-section of form 20; as shown therein tie 152 extends for very nearly the height of panels 100,<br>
120. In one embodiment, panels 100,120 are approximately 24 inches in height, while tie 152 is 21<br>
inches in height.<br>
FIG. 12 depicts forty-five degree angle form 24, for a forty-five degree angle in a wall made<br>
of forms 20. FIG. 13 depicts right angle form 22, for a right angle corner in a wall made of forms 20.<br>
Panels 40,42 each include a right angle turn. Similarly, both panels 44,46 include forty-five degree<br>
turns; as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, the tongues and grooves are arranged as in form 20 of FIG. 9.<br>
In form 22 of FIG. 13 there are depicted corner attachment studs 48,48'. providing a metal<br>
strip on each plane adjacent the intersection as shown. The corner attachment studs 48, 48' thus<br>
provide an attachment stud of a dimension substantially the same as that of metal strip 180, and<br>
arranged in the same orientation. The corner attachment studs 48, 48' can further include a portion<br>
that extends into the cavity, as shown, for securing the corner attachment studs 48, 48' to the<br>
concrete. The portion extending into the cavity may be made of expanded metal, with the portion<br>
corresponding to metal strip 180 consisting of a solid metal sheet. While corner attachment studs<br>
48, 48' are shown only in connection with form 22, it is to be understood that similar corner<br>
attachment studs may be employed in any corner form, including forms 12,14 or 14.<br>
FIG. 15 depicts tie 152, made up of a plurality of horizontal metal wires 160,160', 160",<br>
160'", 160"", 160	, and vertical wires 162,162', 162". The horizontal and vertical wires are at<br>
right angles, and each wire is affixed to each other wire at the intersection point thereof. Such<br>
affixing or joining may be by any means, including mechanical fasteners, adhesives or the like; in a<br>
preferred embodiment the wires are welded one to the other. The wires are of a suitable diameter to<br>
provide the requisite structural strength and integrity; in a preferred embodiment the diameter of the<br>
wires range from about 0.10 inches to about 0.15 inches, and most preferably about 0.12 inches.<br>
Metal attachment studs 180,180' are affixed or joined to horizontal wires 160,160', 160", 160'",<br>
160"", 160'' by any means, including mechanical fasteners, adhesives or the like; in a preferred<br>
embodiment the studs are welded to the horizontal wires; preferably welded to each horizontal wire<br>
in two spots. The tie 152 may be galvanized or otherwise coated to provide protection against rust<br>
or other corrosion prior to use of the form. Each of horizontal metal wires 160,160', 160", 160'",<br>
160"", 160	are co-planar one with the other, and similarly each of vertical wires 162,162', 162"<br>
are co-planar one with the other. As is shown in FIG. 18, it is possible and contemplated that<br><br>
vertical wire 162' (and all other vertical wires) has a semicircular bend at the intersection with<br>
horizontal wire 160' (and all other horizontal wires) the circle defined by the semicircular bend<br>
having a radius approximately equal to the diameter of the horizontal wire, such that horizontal wire<br>
160' and vertical wire 162' (and all other vertical and horizontal wires) are substantially co-planar.<br>
The semicircular bend may be a crimp, and may be formed by pressing means, including pressing<br>
and forming the bend or crimp in the vertical wire using the horizontal wire. Alternatively, the<br>
horizontal wires and vertical wires may constitute two separate planes, with each horizontal wire<br>
contacting each vertical wire, and vice versa. Alternative configuration metal tie 150 is shown in<br>
FIG. 19, depicting a plurality of horizontal metal wires 160,160', 160", 160'", 160"", and vertical<br>
wires 162,162', 162", 162'", and metal attachment studs 180,180'. A top view of tie 150 is shown<br>
in FIG. 16; it may be seen that in that embodiment metal attachment studs 180,180' extend slightly<br>
beyond the end of horizontal wire 160. The length of tie 150, prior to introduction of the right angle<br>
bends, is greater than the width of corresponding form 10; as shown in FIG. 17 the ends of wire 160,<br>
and optionally including a portion of metal attachment studs 180,180', are bend in a right angle,<br>
such that tie 150 with right angle bends is wholly disposed within a distance slightly less than the<br>
width of form 10, as shown in FIG. 4. Preferably the tie 150 is of a length such that metal<br>
attachment studs 180,180' lie a fixed distance below the external surface of panels 50, 70. such as<br>
about one-half inch below the surface.<br>
Metal attachment studs 180,180' are preferably metal strips of a steel metal of suitable<br>
gauge for use with standard dry-wall screws, self-tapping screws or sheet metal screws. In one<br>
embodiment, a 22 gauge strip is employed. Studs 180,180' may similarly be galvanized, and<br>
preferably are galvanized together with the vertical and horizontal wires, it may be seen, as shown<br>
in FIGS. 17 and 20, that the metal attachment stud 180' is disposed within the interior of the<br>
horizontal wires 160,160', 160", 160'", 160"", and thus the horizontal wires serve to secure and<br>
hold in place metal attachment stud 180'during use.<br>
The invention thus provides insulating concrete forms consisting of two panels of expanded<br>
polystyrene or other insulating polymeric material tied together with a form tie of metal, preferably<br>
steel, which provides an attachment surface which runs parallel to the surface of each panel either<br>
directly on the surface of the form, or is submerged within the structure of the panel, such as about<br>
one-half inch from the exterior surface of the panel. The foam panels are preferably molded around<br><br>
the ties, so that the ties become an integral part of a molded form. Alternatively the ties are<br>
separate pieces used to assemble two independently formed or cut panels of foam to make a form,<br>
such as assembly in the field as walls are being constructed.<br>
Three key functions of the form ties are provided: to maintain the integrity of the form during<br>
the placement of concrete by preventing the foam panels from deforming or separating, to provide<br>
ample space for concrete to flow through and around the tie to facilitate the formation of a solid<br>
concrete wall, and to provide a secure surface for the mechanical attachment of interior and exterior<br>
wall coverings. Each form tie consists of welded wire, such as welded galvanized steel wire, of any<br>
specified diameter, spaced at regulated intervals, depending on the form size and thickness. The<br>
width and height of the steel grid is dependent on the height and thickness of the expanded<br>
polystyrene (EPS) form.<br>
In one embodiment on each vertical edge of the grid is a galvanized steel strip, approximately<br>
1 ¾ inches to 2 inches in width, which is bent in the vertical plane at a right angle (a 90° angle) to<br>
align the surface of the strip in a parallel plane to the exterior surface of the EPS form. This<br>
galvanized steep strip forms an attachment stud, providing a secure surface for the mechanical<br>
attachment of interior and exterior wall coverings. The strip is bent such that at least part of the<br>
strip, and preferably a majority of the strips remain in the same plane as the wire grid. The bend in<br>
the steel creates a much higher moment of inertia and section modulus, which adds significant<br>
strength to the strip itself, and to the entire tie assembly. The horizontal wires of the tie grid extend<br>
to the outside of the bend, which restrains the steel strip in case of separation of the assembly and<br>
reinforces the "pull-out" strength of the strip when wall coverings are mechanically attached.<br>
In another embodiment, the strip utilized as an attachment stud may be made from alternative<br>
materials, including an expanded or perforated metal strip. Similarly, the width of the strip may vary,<br>
depending on the specific application, realizing that sufficient width should be provided to permit the<br>
strip to function as an attachment stud.<br>
The use of welded wire maximizes the flow of concrete within the form by minimizing the<br>
restrictive surface area of the tie, providing a distinct working advantage during the placement of<br>
concrete. The strength of the welded wire and bent-strip design is sufficient to hold the form<br>
together under the extreme pressures of concrete placement, while introducing almost no tie<br>
material into the form cavity which might restrict the flow of concrete.<br><br>
The welded wire ties may be constructed such that the horizontal and vertical wires are<br>
essentially co-planer, with a circular radius bend in one or both wires at the point of intersection.<br>
Thus the wires of the wire ties are essentially co-planer and the thickness of the wire, except at<br>
intersection points of horizontal and vertical wires, where the wire portion has a thickness of two<br>
wires.<br>
The welded wire ties are conventionally welded at each intersection point of the horizontal and<br>
vertical wires. The steel strip, whether solid, galvanized, perforated, expanded or otherwise<br>
fabricated, can conventionally be continuously welded to the horizontal wire members at all points of<br>
contact therewith. In the embodiment wherein the strip itself is bent in the vertical plane at a right<br>
angle to align a surface of the strip in a parallel plane to the surface of the EPS form, it is possible<br>
and contemplated that the strip will be welded to the horizontal wire members on both planes.<br>
While wire has been used in other concrete forming applications, the invention disclosed<br>
herein provides a unique combination of a welded wire grid with an attached steel strip, bent to both<br>
strengthen the assembly and provide for a secure, fire-resistant attachment surface for mechanically<br>
attaching wall finishes.<br>
It is further to be understood that while this invention is described in terms of expanded<br>
polystyrene forms, any plastic or other material that can be suitably molded and provide desired<br>
insulating properties may be employed. The use of related polymeric materials for insulation and<br>
similar applications is known in the art.<br>
The welded steel form tie of this invention offers more strength, improved concrete flow, and a<br>
larger, more secure attachment stud than other ties known in the art. In one embodiment the<br>
welded steel form tie is made of heavy-gauge galvanized steel wire welded together in at least 40<br>
locations, including to the attachment stud, to ensure the structural integrity of each form. The ties<br>
in the 16 inch high waffle forms are in one embodiment a full 13 inches tall, and may in another<br>
embodiment be 21 inches tall in flat panel forms with a 24 inch height. Generous spacing of the<br>
steel wires within the welded steel tie virtually eliminates any obstruction to the flow of concrete in<br>
the insulating concrete forms of this invention, significantly improving the consolidation of the<br>
concrete and the speed of construction. This design also minimizes the vibration of the forms during<br>
concrete placement and stabilizes the entire wall. The insulating concrete form of this invention has<br>
a recessed attachment stud, forming a part of the welded steel form tie, which is 1-1/2" wide, and is<br><br>
clearly marked on both sides for the full height of the form. This recessed feature simplifies the<br>
application of synthetic stuccos and other bonded surface coatings. The ties are placed so that the<br>
attachment studs remain on center, such as on 6 or 12 inches centers, regardless of the direction in<br>
which the form is installed. The insulating concrete forms of this invention are thus reversible end-<br>
to-end. The ties are spaced to allow end-to-end reversibility, so that insulating concrete forms of this<br>
invention can be installed in any direction, while maintaining the structural integrity of the concrete<br>
posts and the alignment of the attachment studs. This feature also allows for the efficient<br>
pre-panelization or assembly of wall sections that can significantly speed the process of installation.<br>
The insulating concrete form further uses a tongue and groove design to permit the form to be<br>
wet-set, thereby allowing the form to be easily and speedily erected.<br>
The combination of a tongue and groove on each panel of the insulating concrete form of this<br>
invention permits the forms to be reversible end-to-end, while providing continuous insulation.<br>
Forms which are butt fit without an interlocking means are susceptible to heat loss through cracks.<br>
By use of both a tongue and a groove on each panel, the insulation is thus continuous with no heat<br>
loss.<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these<br>
preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and<br>
modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to<br>
cover in the appended claims all such modifications and equivalents. The entire disclosures of all<br>
references, applications, patents, and publications cited above are hereby incorporated by<br>
