METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL OPERATION OF<br>
AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL. TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions, and more specifically to control during clutch<br>
transitions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel/electric hybrid powertrain architectures comprise torque-<br>
generative devices, including internal combustion engines and electric<br>
machines, which transmit torque through a transmission device to a vehicle<br>
driveline. One such transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
motive torque from an internal combustion engine, and an output member for<br>
delivering motive torque from the transmission to the vehicle driveline. The<br>
exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively operative in fixed<br>
gear modes and continuously variable modes through actuation of torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational speed of the<br>
transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of the input<br>
member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when rotational speed<br>
of the transmission output member is variable based upon operating speeds of<br>
one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines can be connected to<br>
the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct connection. Clutch<br>
actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a hydraulic circuit,<br>
including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management valves, pressure<br>
control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled by a control<br>
module.<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
[0003] Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-hydraulic<br>
transmissions are tasked with developing shifting schemes between various<br>
operating modes, including the fixed gear modes and the continuously variable<br>
modes. Execution of a shift typically potentially includes deactivating an off-<br>
going clutch, and/or actuating an oncoming clutch. A control system is<br>
typically programmed to execute tasks during shift transitions to effect a<br>
smooth shift transition substantially imperceptible to the vehicle operator. A<br>
fault may occur in a component of the hydraulic circuit, such as during<br>
execution of a shift.<br>
[0004] There is a need to for a method and apparatus to control operation of<br>
a electro-mechanical transmission upon detection of presence of a fault, to<br>
prevent operation of the transmission in an unintended condition, and to<br>
maintain unobtrusive operation of the vehicle while confirming existence of<br>
the fault, and to prevent premature operator notification.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] There is provided a method, preferably executed in an article of<br>
manufacture, and an apparatus, to control a torque transmission device of a<br>
powertrain. The torque transmission device comprises an electro-hydraulic<br>
circuit operative to selectively actuate torque-transfer clutches by selective<br>
control of hydraulic circuit flow control devices. The method comprises<br>
monitoring pressures in the hydraulic circuit, and identifying a fault and<br>
restricting operation of the torque transmission device when any one of the<br>
monitored pressures in the hydraulic circuit does not correspond to an<br>
expected pressure thereat. Presence of the fault is verified during the<br>
restricted operation.<br>
[0006] The invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon<br>
reading and understanding the following detailed description of the<br>
embodiments.<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0014] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 arc disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode.<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
preferably directly driven by an internal combustion engine 14. The<br>
transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four<br>
torque-transmitting devices, i.e. clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. An<br>
electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by transmission<br>
control module 17, is operative to control actuation and deactivation of the<br>
clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated<br>
rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 and C3 preferably comprise<br>
comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices grounded to the<br>
transmission case 68.<br>
[0015] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined to an outer gear member of the second planetary gear<br>
set 26, and connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br>
[0016] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 arc further compounded in that<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26. respectively, arc<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 oi' the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through clutch C2 62. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64. An inner gear member of the second planetary gear set 26 is connected to<br>
an inner gear member of the third planetary gear set 28 through a sleeve shaft<br>
66 that circumscribes shaft 60, and is connected to a second electrical machine<br>
comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br>
[0017] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. MG-<br>
A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which permits<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56 and 72. Transmission output member 64 is operably connected<br>
to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive torque. Each clutch is preferably<br>
hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a pump,<br>
described below, via an electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
[0018] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (HSD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and electrochemical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention. The HSD 74 is preferably sized based<br>
upon factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related<br>
to typical road grade and temperature, and propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The IiSD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an element of the control system described<br>
hereinafter with regard to Tig. 2. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy<br>
to and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly<br>
transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31.<br>
Electrical current is transmitted to and from the HSD 74 in accordance with<br>
whether the HSD 74 is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the<br>
pair of power inverters and respective motor control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom for<br>
providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
[0019] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC transmission lines and provides AC current to the respective<br>
electrical machine, i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and<br>
31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from<br>
the electrical machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and transmits<br>
current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the<br>
inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical<br>
energy storage device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-<br>
phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that<br>
is mounted on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known<br>
complementary three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is depicted. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56. 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23.<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module ("TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP") 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UP) 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the<br>
transmission 10 through a request for a torque output. Exemplary vehicle<br>
operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal.<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the<br>
aforementioned control modules communicates with other control modules,<br>
sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol<br>
utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols<br>
provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between<br>
the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque request, an engine torque command,<br>
clutch torque commands for the various clutches Cl, C2, C3. C4 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B. The<br>
TCM is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 of<br>
Figs. 1 and 4 to monitor various pressure sensing devices, and generate and<br>
execute control signals for various solenoids and control valves contained<br>
therein.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is depicted generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
temperature, engine input speed, NI, to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches C1, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br>
rotational speed, NO, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches ('PS1)<br>
and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to<br>
actuate various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes, as<br>
described hereinbelow.<br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the HSD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
[0025] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes<br>
previously referenced power inverters and motor control modules configured<br>
to receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to<br>
provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable<br>
to generate torque commands for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, based upon input<br>
from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and<br>
system operating parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are implemented by the control system, including the TPIM 19, to<br>
control MG-A and MG-B. Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or<br>
conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and communicates<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
motor speeds to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the BSD 74<br>
is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0026] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0027] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules arc typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0028] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13. the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine requested output torque at shaft 64, also referred to as the<br>
operator torque request. Selectively operated components of the transmission<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator<br>
demand. For example, in the exemplary embodiment depicted in Fig. 1 and 2,<br>
when the operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either<br>
the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output<br>
torque which affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates.<br>
Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g.. road<br>
load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states<br>
of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br>
required to arrive at the desired torque output. Under the direction of the HCP<br>
5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast<br>
in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0029] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and Table 1,<br>
below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Transmission Operating Mode	Actuated C1utches<br>
Mode I	C1 70	<br>
Fixed Ratio 1 (GR1)	C1 70	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 2 (GR2)	C1 70	C2 62<br>
Mode II	C2 62	<br>
Fixed Ratio 3 (GR3)	C2 62	C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio 4 (GR4)	C2 62	C3 73<br>
[0030] The various transmission operating modes described with reference<br>
to Tables 1 and 2 indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2. C3, and C4<br>
are engaged or actuated for each operating mode. Additionally, in various<br>
transmission operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as an<br>
electrical motor to generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
electrical energy. Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect when<br>
the electrical machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and arc not<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0031] The control system, depicted primarily in Fig. 2. is operable to<br>
provide a range of transmission output speeds at shaft 64 from relatively slow<br>
to relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two<br>
modes with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the<br>
transmission 10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway<br>
speeds, and meet various other requirements as previously described.<br>
Additionally, the control system coordinates operation of the transmission 10<br>
so as to allow synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0032] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0033] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e. N/No, is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation ol' the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power How,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>

power from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B. through planetary<br>

[0034] Referring to Fig. 3, a schematic diagram is depicted which provides a<br>
more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for<br>
controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission. The main<br>
hydraulic pump 88, driven off the input shaft from the engine 10, and auxiliary<br>
pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19, provide<br>
pressurized fluid to the hydraulic circuit 42 through valve 140. The auxiliary<br>
pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, which is<br>
operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices,<br>
including the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73. and C4 75. cooling<br>
circuits for machines A and B, and a circuit for cooling and lubricating the<br>
transmission 10 via passages 142, 144 (not depicted in detail). As previously<br>
stated, the TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate the various clutches to<br>
achieve various transmission operating modes through selective actuation of<br>
hydraulic circuit flow control devices comprising pressure control solenoids<br>
('PCS') PCS1 108, PCS2 112, PCS3 114, PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled<br>
flow management valves X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120. The circuit is fluidly<br>
connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3. and PS4 via passages 124, 122,<br>
126, and 128, respectively. The pressure control solenoid PCS1 108 has<br>
control positions of neutral and high and is operative to provide modulation of<br>
fluidic pressure in the hydraulic circuit through fluidic interaction with valve<br>
109. Pressure control solenoid PCS2 112 has control positions of neutral and<br>
low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow<br>
therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure<br>
switch PS3 via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has control<br>
positions of neutral and high, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and<br>
operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
fluidly connected to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS4 116 has control positions of neutral and low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
[0035] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have controlled operating states of High ('1') and Low ('0'). The<br>
controlled operating states reference positions of each valve effecting flow<br>
control to different flow control devices in the hydraulic circuit 42 and the<br>
transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is operable to direct pressurized fluid to<br>
clutches C3 and C4 and cooling systems for stators of MG-A and MG-B via<br>
fluidic passages 136, 138, 144, 142 respectively, depending upon the source of<br>
the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is fluidly<br>
connected to PS2 via passage 122, and is operable to direct pressurized fluid to<br>
clutches C1 and C2 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively, depending<br>
upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter. A more<br>
detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is<br>
provided in commonly assigned and co-pending U.S. Patent Application<br>

[0038] Referring now to Fig. 4, various transmission operating modes arc<br>
plotted as a function of transmission output speed, NO, and transmission input<br>
speed. N, for the exemplary transmission and control system depicted in Fig. 1<br>
and 2. The Fixed Ratio operation is shown as individual lines for each of the<br>
specific gear ratios, GR1, GR2, GR3, and GR4, as described with reference to<br>
Table 1, above. The continuously variable Mode operation is shown as ranges<br>
of operation for each of Mode I and Mode II. THE transmission operating<br>
mode is switched between Fixed Ratio operation and continuously variable<br>
Mode operation by activating or deactivating specific clutches. The control<br>
system is operative to determine a specific transmission operating mode based<br>
upon various criteria, using algorithms and calibrations executed by the<br>
control system, and is outside the scope of this invention. Selection of the<br>
mode of operation of the transmission depends primarily on operator input and<br>
the ability of the powertrain to meet that input.<br>
[0039] Referring to Tables 1 and 2 and again to Fig. 4, the low range<br>
operating state includes selective actuation of clutches C2, C1, and C4.<br>
facilitating operation in any one of continuously variable Mode I, and fixed<br>
gears GR1, GR2, and GR3. The high range operating state includes selective<br>
actuation of clutches C2, C3, and C4, facilitating operation in any one of<br>
continuously variable Mode II and fixed gears GR3 and GR4. It should be<br>
recognized that ranges of continuously variable operation for Mode 1 and<br>
Mode II may overlap.<br>
[0040] Referring now to fable 3, below, a table comprising expected signal<br>
output states of the pressure switches PS1. PS2. PS3, and PS4 in the<br>
exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided for various<br>
transmission operating modes. Each of the pressure switches PS1. PS2, PS3.<br>
PS4 have hydraulic output states of 0 - Off and 1 On, wherein the state-<br>
transition occurs at a threshold appropriate to the hydraulic circuit. In this<br>
embodiment, the state transition preferably occurs at about 140 kPa (50 psi).<br><br>

meaning that output state of each pressure switch is "0" or Off when the<br>
monitored hydraulic pressure is less than 140 kPa and the output state of each<br>
pressure switch is "1" or On when the monitored hydraulic pressure is greater<br>
than 140 kPa. 'LM' indicates the PCS1 is used for line pressure modulation.<br>

[0041] In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. There may be a change<br>
in demand for an operator demand for torque. Such demands are typically<br>
communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g., changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to<br>
change one of the electrical machines between electrical energy generating<br>
mode and torque generating mode. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of<br>
charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56. 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and<br>
MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and there can be changes in system optimization that compel a shift change in<br>
order to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage<br>
battery charging. Furthermore, a shift change may be predicated upon a fault<br>
in a component or system. The distributed control module architecture acts in<br>
concert to determine a need for a change in the transmission operating mode,<br>
and executes the forgoing to effect the change in transmission operation. A<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
shift change in the exemplary system comprises one of at least three possible<br>
situations. There can be a shift from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear.<br>
There can be a shift from a fixed gear to one of the continuously variable<br>
modes. There can be a shift from one of the continuously variable modes to a<br>
fixed gear.<br>
[0042] Referring now to Fig. 5, a preferred method of controlling a hybrid<br>
powertrain system, described with reference to operating the exemplary<br>
powertrain of Figs. 1, 2, and 3, is now provided. The invention generally<br>
comprises an algorithm, resident in one of the control modules of the<br>
distributed control module architecture and executed therein, which acts to<br>
limit operation of the transmission to a restricted mode upon an indication of a<br>
fault. The invention is described with reference to a shift execution, but it is<br>
understood that the action described herein is applicable to any instance<br>
wherein a clutch is being actuated or deactivated, wherein there is an<br>
indication of a clutch unexpectedly being actuated or remaining actuated after<br>
a command to deactivate.<br>
[0043] A command to execute a shift from one operating mode to a second<br>
operating mode occurs during ongoing operation (Block 200). Executing each<br>
shift generally comprises one of the following: deactivating an off-going<br>
('OG') clutch; actuating an oncoming ('OC') clutch; and, a combination of<br>
deactivating an off-going ('OG') clutch and actuating an oncoming ("OC")<br>
clutch (Block 202). Deactivating the OG clutch generally results in an action<br>
to off-load clutch torque from the OG clutch, and a command to deactivate the<br>
OG clutch as part of overall shift execution. Commands to deactivate the OG<br>
clutch and actuate the OC clutch typically originate in the HCP 5 and are<br>
communicated to the TCM 17, which interprets the commands by selectively<br>
activating or deactivating the related pressure control solenoid PCS1 112,<br>
PCS2 114, PCS3 116 and/or XY valves 118, 120 in the electro-hydraulic<br>
circuit. A command to actuate the OC clutch generally includes actions to<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
increase hydraulic pressure to the OC clutch device to effect a smooth<br>
transition.<br>
[0044] The TCM monitors deactivation of the OG clutch and actuation of the<br>
OC clutch by monitoring signal outputs of all the pressure switch devices<br>
('PS'), e.g. devices 122, 124, 126 and 128 of Fig. 3, to verify that the OG<br>
clutch has deactivated and the OC clutch is ready to be actuated, and to verify<br>
that no other action has occurred such as may cause inadvertent or unexpected<br>
actuation or deactivation of one of the clutches (Block 204). The pressure<br>
switch outputs are compared to expected outputs ("PSEXPFCTED of the related<br>
pressure switch, with expected outputs as shown with reference to fable 3,<br>
above (Block 206).<br>
[0045] A fault is typically initially indicated by an unexpected reading from<br>
one of the pressure switches, shown with reference to 'fable 3 for this<br>
embodiment. An indicated fault is communicated to the TCM and the 1ICP.<br>
When a fault is not detected, execution of the shift is completed (Block 208).<br>
[0046] A fault can be identified in the electro-hydraulic control circuit<br>
related to a clutch actuation event, a clutch deactivation event, or a clutch<br>
slippage event during a shift or vehicle launch. During a clutch actuation<br>
event, a fault is preferably identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of<br>
the output states of the pressure switches does not match the expected state<br>
after an elapsed time of about 150 milliseconds. During a clutch deactivation<br>
event, a fault is preferably identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of<br>
the output states of the pressure switches does not match the expected state<br>
after an elapsed time of about one second. During a clutch slippage event, a<br>
fault is preferably identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of the<br>
output states of the pressure switches does not match the expected state after<br>
an elapsed time of about two seconds. A hydraulic circuit fault may comprise<br>
a stuck spool valve, a malfunctioning solenoid valve, a faulty pressure switch,<br>
a wiring harness malfunction, debris in a hydraulic line, and others.<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
20<br>
[0047] When a fault is detected based upon signal output from one of the<br>
pressure switches, the transmission is commanded to operate in a restricted<br>
operating mode, referred to as "safe haven", preferably within an elapsed time<br>
of 150 milliseconds of initial detection of the fault (Block 210). The safe<br>
haven mode comprises permitting operation of the transmission only in<br>
specific operating modes, and, accordingly prohibiting operation of the<br>
transmission any other mode. There are at least three permissible safe haven<br>
modes. A first safe haven mode comprises permissible operation only in GR1,<br>
GR2 and Mode I, and is selectable when a fault related to actuation of clutch<br>
C3 or PCS3 occurs. A second safe haven mode comprises permissible<br>
operation only in GR3, GR4, and Mode II, and is selectable when a fault<br>
related to clutch C1 occurs. A third safe haven mode comprises permissible<br>
operation only in Mode I and Mode II, and is selectable when a fault related to<br>
either of clutches C3 and C4 occurs. The HCP preferably controls operation<br>
in the safe haven mode for the remainder of the current operating cycle, i.e.<br>
until the vehicle is stopped and restarted.<br>
[0048] While operating in the safe haven mode, the HCP controls operation<br>
of the engine and machines MG-A and MG-B to maintain torque output of the<br>
transmission to the vehicle driveline. In this embodiment, the 'safe haven'<br>
mode is preferably effected by selectively changing control state of the X-<br>
valve solenoid 118 from High ('1') to Low ("0"), or vice-versa.<br>
[0049] While the transmission is operating in the safe haven mode, the<br>
control system verifies the presence of the fault (Block 212). C1utch<br>
deactivation can be verified by monitoring a relationship between the input<br>
speed, NI, and the output speed NO, albeit after a time delay. Fault verification<br>
can include selective actuation of the PCS device related to the fault during<br>
safe haven operation, and monitoring an expected outcome.<br><br>
GP-308563-PTH-CD<br>
21<br>
[0050] When the fault is not verified (Block 214), i.e. not reproduced during<br>
operation in the restricted mode, the command to operate the transmission in<br>
the restricted mode is disabled (Block 216), and the control system resumes<br>
normal operation of the transmission, including continuing the shift execution<br>
(Block 218). When the fault is verified, the control system continues<br>
commanding operation of the transmission in the restricted mode (Block 220),<br>
and notifies the vehicle operator of the fault, including illuminating a service<br>
lamp on a vehicle instrument panel (Block 222).<br>
[0051] By way of example, when the exemplary transmission is operating in<br>
GR1, clutches C1 and C4 are actuated. When a command to shift to GR2 is<br>
executed, clutch C4 is commanded to deactivate by deactivating solenoid<br>
PCS4. When output from pressure switch PS4 indicates a drop in pressure<br>
when PCS4 is deactivated, the shift execution continues. However, when<br>
output from pressure switch PS4 docs not indicate a drop in pressure when<br>
PCS4 is deactivated, then the X-valve 118 is commanded to Low state, or "0".<br>
thus effecting operation in continuously variable Mode II, as shown with<br>
reference to Table 2, above. While the transmission is operating in Mode 11.<br>
the control system verifies the presence of the fault in PCS4 by selectively<br>
actuating PCS4 and determining whether the commanded cooling of the stator<br>
of MG A is occurring (See Table 2), based upon feedback from temperature<br>
sensors (not depicted) operable to monitor temperature of the stator of MG A.<br>
[0052] When presence of the fault is not verified, i.e. not reproduced during<br>
operation in the restricted mode, the command to operate the transmission in<br>
Mode II is disabled, and the control system resumes normal operation of the<br>
transmission. When presence of the fault is verified, the control system<br>
continues commanding operation of the transmission in Mode II, and notifies<br>
the vehicle operator of the fault, including illuminating the service lamp on the<br>
instrument panel in the vehicle.<br><br>
