This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 10/621,027, Filed July 16, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated in its entirety by reference here into this application.<br>
Throughout this application, various references are cited. Disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This disclosure relates to a method for introducing substances into cells comprising contacting a composition comprising orally administered beta-glucan with said cells. A feature of this invention provides a method for introducing substances into a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of the above compositions. The substance which could be delivered orally includes but is .not limited to peptides, proteins, RNAs, DNAs, chemotherapeutic agents, biologically active agents, and plasmids. Other small molecules and compounds may be used as well. Another feature of the present invention is a composition comprising orally administered beta-glucan capable of enhancing efficacy of IgM antibodies.<br>
Glucans derived from cell walls of yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cervisiae or mutant yeast strains described in U.S. Patent No. 5,250,436, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference, may be used in the above compositions. Glucans having β(1-3) and β(1-6) linkages may be prepared by the process described in U.S. Patent No. 5,233,491 and 4,810,646, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.  Soluble or aqueous glucans which are<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
suitable for oral administration may be produced by the process described in U.S. Patent No. 4,810,646 and 5,519,009, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
Beta-glucans have been tested for tumor therapy in mice for nearly 40 years. ' Several forms of mushroom derived beta-glucans are used clinically to treat cancer in Japan, including PSK (from Coriolus versicolor), Lentinan and Schizophyllan. In randomized trials in Japan, PSK has moderately, but significantly improved survival rates in some cancer trials: after gastrectomy,3'4 colorectal surgery,5'6 and esophagectomy7 to remove primary tumors. Results have been less encouraging in breast cancer,8'9 and leukemia.10 Schizophyllan has improved survival of patients with operable gastric cancer, u inoperable gastric cancer,12'13 and cervical cancer.14 Again, though survival differences between groups were statistically significant, these improvements were modest. While beta-glucans are not widely used by Western oncologists, beta-glucan containing botanical medicines such as Reishi and maitake15 are widely used by U.S. cancer patients as alternative/complementary cancer therapies. These previous studies that looked for a therapeutic  effect of beta-glucan, did not incorporate co-administration of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) as part of the protocol. There is increasing evidence that antibody is necessary to deposit iC3b which acts as a potent opsonin of human tumors. When beta-glucan is administered without co-administration of MoAb, its tumor cytotoxic effect requires the presence of naturally-occurring antitumor antibodies which can be quite variable among patients and even in experimental mice.<br>

Anti-tumor effect of beta-glucan when combined with cancer specific antibodies was previously described. Previous studies have shown that oral beta-glucans derived from barley or oats can greatly enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies in xenograph models. See Therapy-Enhancing Glucan, Int' 1 Application No. PCT/US02/01276, filed January 15, 2002. Cheung et al., Oral (1-3),(1-4)-beta-glucan syngergizes with anti-ganglioside GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8 in the therapy of neuroblastoma. Clin Cancer Res. 2002;8:1217-1223. Cheung NK et al.. Orally administered beta-glucans enhance anti-tumor effects of monoclonal antibodies. Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2002; 51:557-564. The phase I clinical trial supports the prediction that barley beta-glucan can enhance the antibody effect on metastatic cancer. As previously noted, lentinan and laminarin,<br>
both (l-»3), (1-6)-β-D-glucans, were not as effective as barley glucan.16 In addition, among the (l-&gt;3), (l-&gt;4)-β-D-glucans, small molecular weight preparations and Lichenans were not as effective. The molecular size and the fine structure of beta-glucan may have substantial influence on their synergistic effect on antibodies towards tumors.<br>
In Europe and USA beta-glucans especially from Bakers' yeast have long been employed as feed additives for animals, as dietary supplement for humans,17 in treatment of wounds,18 and as an active ingredient in skin cream formulations. The basic structural unit in beta-glucans is the (3 (l-&gt;3) -linked glucosyl units. Depending upon the source and method of isolation, beta-glucans have various degrees of branching and of linkages in the side chains. The frequency and hinge-structure of side chains determines its immunomodulor effect. beta-glucans of fungal and yeast origin are normally insoluble in water, but can be made soluble either by acid hydrolysis or by derivatisation introducing charged groups like -phosphate, -sulphate, -amine,<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
-carboxymethyl and so forth to the molecule.19'20<br>
Soluble glucan with the molecular structure where (l-&gt;3)-p-D-glucan units form the backbone with branches made up of (1-3) -β-D-glucan units positioned at (1-6) -β-D-glucan hinges was isolated from Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. t  High molecular weight fractions were obtained and<br><br><br><br><br><br>
tested for synergy with monoclonal antibodies in tumor models. The anti-tumor effect of soluble yeast beta-glucan was found to be comparable to the anti-tumor effect of soluble barley beta-glucan, when combined with monoclonal antibodies specific for human cancer as detailed below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a method for introducing substances into cells comprising contacting a composition comprising orally administered beta-glucan with said cells.<br>
Another aspect of the present is a method for introducing substances into a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of the above compositions. The substance which could be delivered orally includes but is not limited to peptides, proteins, RNAs, DNAs, chemotherapeutic agents, biologically active agents, and plasmids. Other small molecules and compounds may be used as well.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a composition for oral uptake of substance comprising an appropriate amount of carbohydrates. In an embodiment, the carbohydrate is glucan.<br>
When administered orally, glucan is taken up by macrophages and<br>
monocytes which carry these carbohydrates to the marrow and<br>
reticuloendothelial system from where they are released, in an<br>
appropriately processed form, onto myeloid cells including<br>
neutrophils,, and onto lymphoid cells including natural killer<br>
(NK) cells.'.      This processed glucan binds to CR3 on these<br>
neutrophils ;and NK cells, activating them in tumor cytotoxicity<br>
in the presence of tumor-specific antibodies.<br>
-10-<br><br>
Since macrophage and monocytes ingest glucan (whether soluble, gel or particle) from the gut, glucan is a potential conduit for gene therapy. Unlike proteins, DNA or plasmids are relatively heat-stable, and can be easily incorporated into warm soluble barley glucan which gels when cooled to room or body temperature. When mice are fed these DNA-glucan complexes, reporter genes can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes and macrophages within days. More importantly these reporter genes are expressed in these cells, a few days after ingestion of these DNA complexes. These findings have potential biologic implications. Glucan and similar carbohydrates may be conduits for DNA or plasmids to get into the human body. Oral glucan may be a convenient vehicle for correcting genetic defects of macrophages/monocytes, or administering genetic vaccines.<br>
As it can easily be appreciated by an ordinary skilled artisan,<br>
other carbohydrates capable of functioning like glucan could be i<br>
identified and used in a similar fashion. One easy screening for such carbohydrates can be established using glucan as the positive control.<br>

Example I<br>
Phase I study of barley p-glucan in combination with anti-GD2 antibody in stage 4 neuroblastoma.<br>
-15-<br><br>
A total of 24 patients were studied. These patients are all children or adolescents with relapsed or refractory stage 4neuroblastoma metastatic to bone, marrow or distant lymph nodes, some with large soft tissue masses. Beta-glucan was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. Anti-tumor responses were recorded for marrow disease (histology, MIBG scans), soft tissue tumors (CT), as well biochemical markers (urine VMA and HVA tumor markers) . One example of tumor response is shown in figures 1A and IB: 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans showing near-complete resolution • of extensive metastases after one treatment cycle of 3F8 plus beta-glucan. These responses are uncommon in patients with refractory or relapsed metastatic stage 4 NB treated with 3F8 alone or 3F8 in combination with cytokines. The best response rate for 3F8 to date was in a Phase II trial of combination 3F8 plus GMCSF where 7 of 33 (21%) children achieved MIBG improvement. In contrast, 62% (13 of 21) evaluable patients on 3F8 + beta-glucan had MIBG improvement, a near tripling of the response rate (p=0.008 by %2) . In addition, among 15 patients with marrow disease, 5 achieved complete marrow remission (30%), and 8 with stable disease in the marrow. (See Fig.  1)<br>

subcutaneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) {Daudi and EBV-derived B-NHL) or Hodgkin's disease {Hs445 or RPMI6666) xenografted in SCID mice was significantly suppressed, when compared to mice treated with rituximab or BG alone. Survival of mice with disseminated lymphoma {Daudi and Hs445) was significantly increased. There was no weight loss or clinical toxicity in treated animals. This therapeutic efficacy and lack of toxicity of BG plus rituximab supports further investigation into its clinical utility.<br>
Introduction<br>
The chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is being evaluated in an increasing number of disorders. After clinical efficacy was initially demonstrated against relapsed and refractory follicular/low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma1, responses to rituximab have been reported in other malignant and non-malignant B-cell disorders2. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed including activation of apoptotic pathways3, elaboration of cytokines4, and elicit at ion of host complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)5. Although many patients with B-cell disorders respond to rituximab, remissions are often transient6. More than 50% of lymphomas recurrent after rituximab treatment failed to respond the second time7. Mechanisms of resistance to rituximab are as yet unclear, and may include paucity or loss of target antigen8, pharmacokinetic variations among individual patients, FcR polymorphism9, resistance to complement activity10, or inherent gene expression of the lymphoma11.<br>
beta-glucans are complex polymers of glucose with affinity for the lectin site of the CR3 receptor on leucocytes12. With bound beta-glucan, CR3 (CDllb) is primed to engage iC3b fragments deposited on cells by complement-activating antibodies. This receptor mediates the diapedesis of leukocytes through the<br>
-17-<br><br>
endothelium and stimulates phagocytosis, degranulation and tumor cytotoxicity. Many fungi present beta-glucan or beta-glucan-like CR3 binding ligands on their cell surface. Hence, when iC3b deposition occurs, both CDllb and lectin sites become engaged, and phagocytosis and respiratory burst is triggered13. In contrast, tumor cells lack such molecules, and even when coated with iC3b do not generally activate CR3 and cannot activate leucocytes. Soluble forms of beta-glucan bind to lectin sites and prime both phagocytic and NK cells to kill iC3b-coated tumor targets14.<br>
(1-3), (l-4)-D-β-glucan (BG) , a soluble, barley-derived beta-glucan has advantages over previously studied (l-»3), (l-»6) -p-glucans, particularly efficacy when administered orally and a good safety profile15. In vivo synergism between BG and the complement-fixing antibody 3F8 against human neuroblastoma xenografts15'16 was recently demonstrated. The synergism between -BG and rituximab against lymphoma is now reported.<br>
Study Design<br>
Cell lines:<br>
Human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi, and Hodgkin's disease (HD) cell lines Hs445 and RPMI 6666 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection {Rockville, MD). Human EBV-BLCL were established using previously described methods17<br>
Mice:<br>
Fox Chase ICR SCID mice (Taconic, White Plains, NY) were<br>
maintained under institutionally approved guidelines and<br>
protocols.<br>
Tumor models:<br>
Subcutaneous tumors were established by injecting 5xl06 cells suspended in 0.1 ml of Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) into mice flanks. Tumor dimensions were measured two<br>
-18-<br><br>
to three times a week and tumor size was calculated as the product of the two largest diameters. Mice were sacrificed when maximum tumor dimension exceeded 20mm. A disseminated tumor model was established, in SCID mice as previously described18. Briefly, 5xl06 Daudi or Hs445 cells in 100 μl normal saline were injected intravenously into SCID mice. Tumors grew systemically and mice became paralyzed when tumor cells infiltrated the spinal cord, resulting in hind-leg paralysis. Mice were sacrificed at onset of paralysis or when animals lost 10% of their body weight.<br>
Treatment regimens:<br>
For mice with subcutaneous tumors, therapy was initiated after tumors were established (7-8mm diameter). For the disseminated tumor model, therapy was initiated ten days after injection of tumor cells; Groups of at least "five mice per treatment regimen received either rituximab, BG, neither or both. 200ug rituximab {Genentech, .San Francisco, CA) was injected intravenously twice weekly for a total of eight injections and 400ug BG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) administered orally via intragastric gavage daily for 29 days. Animals were weighed weekly and observed clinically at least once daily.<br>
Statistical analysis:<br>
Tumor growth was calculated by fitting a regression slope for each individual mouse to log transformed values of tumor size. Slopes were compared between groups using t-tests using a previously described method for censored observations19. Survival in mice with disseminated disease was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportion of deaths was compared by Fisher's exact y2 test. Analyses were conducted using STATA 7 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
In all subcutaneous xenograft models, significant reduction in tumor growth was noted in mice treated with a combination of<br>
- 19-<br><br>
rituximab and BG. Mice treated with rituximab alone showed a modest reduction in tumor growth, while those treated with BG alone or left untreated had unabated tumor growth (Figure 1A, IB, 1C). All tumors except for those treated with combination therapy grew beyond 20 mm size and mice had to be sacrificed. Mice on combination treatment had persistent tumor suppression even after treatment was stopped. In a multivariable linear model of tumor growth rate, using dummy variables for treatment, the interaction between BG and rituximab was positive and significant, demonstrating synergism.<br>
For disseminated xenografts, there was a significant difference in survival between the combination and control groups for both NHL and HD models (p12 months after therapy was discontinued suggesting complete eradication of disease. In contrast, 0/29 and 0/8 mice receiving rituximab alone in respective groups survived (15% vs. 0% survival; x2=0.01). There was no significant weight loss or other clinically apparent adverse effects. That BG is absorbed can be inferred from the fact that it could be detected intracellularly within fixed and permeabilized peripheral blood leucocytes by immunofluorescence (data not shown).<br>
In these studies, synergism between BG and rituximab was highly significant irrespective of the type of CD20-positive lymphoma. Improved responses in Daudi xenografts as compared to Hs445 may be attributable to higher CD20 expression in the former (Mean geometric fluorescence channel for Daudi 241 compared to 184 for Hs445) . When tumors that progressed were examined for CD20 expression by immunofluorescence studies of single cell suspensions or indirect immunohistochemistry of frozen sections, no significant difference was noted between groups treated with rituximab, BG alone or rituximab+BG (data not<br>
-20-<br><br>
shown), indicating that treatment with rituximab+BG was not associated with loss of CD20.<br>
Synergism 'between other complement-activating monoclonal antibodies and BG15'16 were previously demonstrated. The current data extend this observation to rituximab. CDC is considered an<br>
important  mechanism  for  rituximab  cytotoxicity.  Rodent<br>
i<br>
complement ;is not inhibited efficiently by human complement regulatory proteins (mCRP). Therefore CDC can be an effective anti-tumor mechanism in xenograft models. However in a study,<br>
i<br>
at sub-therapeutic doses of antibody, rituximab-mediated ADCC and CDC were not sufficient to effect tumor cell killing. Since BG has no direct effect on ADCC , this synergy is most likely a result of iC3b-mediated tumor cytotoxicity. Lymphoma cells express mCRP including CD46, CD55, and CD5910'21. However, iC3b-mediated cytotoxicity is unaffected by the presence of CD59 which affects only MAC-mediated complement cytotoxicity22. Furthermore, in human breast carcinoma tumors, deposition of<br>
i<br>
iC3b has been demonstrated despite the presence of mCRP23 indicating that unlike their inhibitory effect on MAC, effect on iC3b-mediated tumor cytotoxicity is not absolute.<br>
If this synergistic effect can be safely reproduced in humans, iC3b-mediated cytotoxicity may be a potential strategy to overcome rituximab resistance in patients with B-cell malignancies. Since neither T nor B cells are required for this synergistic effect, BG may have a potential role even in immunocompromised lymphoma patients. Furthermore, in patients with autoimmune disorders, B-cell depletion may be enhanced with this non-toxic oral therapy. Conversely, beta-glucans can enhance release of cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-624, and because the acute toxicities of rituximab are also related to cytokine release secondary to complement activation25, there is a potential of increased toxicity when BG and rituximab are used in combination. Carefully designed phase I studies are necessary<br>
-21-<br><br>
in order to define the safety and efficacy in developing BG as an adjunct to rituximab therapy in the treatment of B-cell disorders and in antibody-based therapies of other cancers.<br>

LAN-1 tumor cells were planted (2xl06 cells) in 100 μl of Matrigel (Sigma) subcutaneously. Tumor dimensions were measured two to three times a week with vernier calipers, and tumor size was calculated as the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters. All treatment studies started in groups of 4-5 mice when tumor diameters reached 0.7 to 0.8 cm. Mice received antibody (3F8 or 3G6) treatment (200 μg per day) i.v. {by tail vein injection) twice weekly x 5 doses and oral beta-glucan (400 μg per day) by intragastric injection every day for a total 14-18 days. {See Fig. 5 and 6)<br>

In similar experiments a subcutaneous lymphoma model was studied. Here 5xl06 cells suspended in 0.1 ml of Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were planted into mice flanks. Tumor dimensions were measured two to three times a week and tumor size was calculated as product of the two largest diameters. Mice were sacrificed when maximum tumor dimension exceeded 20mm. 200ug rituximab (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) was injected intravenously twice weekly for a total of eight injections and 400ug glucan administered orally via intragastric gavage daily for 29 days. Mice were weighed weekly and observed clinically at least once daily. The rate of tumor response and the percent of mice achieving complete remissions were comparable between barley glucan and yeast glucan. These series of subcutaneous tumor models showed that soluble yeast (l-»3), (l-»6) beta-glucan of large molecular weight (&gt;10,000 Daltons) is equally potent as barley (1-+3), (l-»4) beta-glucan. In addition, the source and physical form of yeast glucan can make substantial differences.<br>
Metastatic lymphoma model was also studied. A model of<br>
disseminated tumors was established in SCID mice as previously<br>
described. (1.) Briefly, 5xl06 Daudi cells in 100 μl normal saline<br>
were injected intravenously (i.v.) into SCID mice. Tumors grew<br>
systemically and mice became paralyzed when tumor cells<br>
infiltrated the spinal canal, resulting in hind-leg paralysis.<br>
-28-<br><br>
Mice were sacrificed at onset of paralysis or when animals lost 10% of their body weight. Therapy was initiated ten days after injection of tumor cells. 40μg rituximab (Genentech; San Francisco, CA) was injected intravenously twice weekly for a total of eight injections and 400μg glucan administered orally via intragastric gavage daily for 29 days. Mice were weighed weekly and observed clinically at least once daily. (See Fig. 7)<br>
Again both barley glucan and yeast glucan showed comparable effect when combined with Rituxan. Neither barely glucan nor yeast glucan has any effect on survival when used alone {data not shown).<br>

Mechanism by which Orally Administered p-Glucans Function with Anti-Tumor Monoclonal Antibodies to Mediate Tumor Regression.(1)<br>
Using syngeneic tumor (GD2+RMA-S) in wild type (WT) C57B1/6 mice versus either CR3-deficient (CDllb-/-) or C3-deficient (C3-/-) C57B1/6 mice, MoAb alone elicited no tumor regression, whereas combining the i.v. anti-GD2 MoAb with oral barley or yeast beta-glucan elicited significant regression in WT but not in CR3-deficient mice. Moreover, the combined treatment with i.v. MoAb and oral beta-glucans produced 60-100% tumor-free survivors in WT mice, but only 0-20% survival in the CR3-deficient mice. These experiments demonstrated a near absolute requirement for<br>
-29-<br><br>
leukocyte CR3 for the anti-tumor effect, especially when oral barley beta-glucan was given with anti-tumor MoAb. A therapy protocol comparing WT to C3-def icient mice similarly showed that oral beta-glucan therapy required serum C3. When barley beta-glucan and yeast beta-glucan were labeled with fluorescein (BG-F and YG-F) and given to mice by intragastric injection, the trafficking of beta-glucan was followed. Within three days of daily oral administration of BG-F or YG-F, macrophages in the spleen and lymph nodes contained fluorescein-labeled beta-glucan. After 4 d, YG-F and BG-F were also observed in macrophages in bone marrow. When the uptake of YG-F and BG-F by WT versus CR3-deficient mice was compared, no differences were apparent in either the percentage of macrophages containing ingested beta-glucan-F or the amount of beta-glucan-F per cell. Thus, the uptake of barley and yeast beta-glucan by gastrointestinal macrophages does not require CR3 and is likely mediated instead by Dectin-1.(2) Macrophages in vitro and in the marrow were able to degrade large molecules of barley or yeast beta-glucan into smaller biologically-active fragments of beta-glucan that are then released.<br>
To determine if the soluble beta-glucan-F released by macrophages had indeed been taken up by bone marrow granulocytes, groups of WT or CR3-deficient mice that had been given YG-F or BG-F for 10 days were injected i.p. with thioglycolate medium to elicit the marginated pool of bone marrow granulocytes into the peritoneal cavity. Only WT granulocytes were able to pick up the YG-F and BG-F released from macrophages. These data suggest a sequential ingestion of beta-glucan by gastrointestinal macrophages that shuttle the beta-glucan to the bone marrow where soluble degradation fragments are released and taken up by granulocytes via membrane CR3. When peritoneal granulocytes' were isolated from WT and CR3-deficient mice that had been given oral beta-glucan, only WT granulocytes were able<br>
-30-<br><br>
to kill iC3b-coated tumor cells in vitro. These experiments show that bone marrow granulocytes and tissue macrophages acquire membrane CR3-bound soluble beta-glucan from gastrointestinal macrophages, and that this bound beta-glucan primes the CR3 of both granulocytes and macrophages so that when they are recruited to a site of inflammation they are able to kill iC3b-coated tumor cells.<br>

alginate, carrageenans, and pectin. Although these materials<br>
were often used as the core polymers in nanoparticulates, no<br>
specific receptor has been identified for these polymers and the<br>
efficiency of uptake remains suboptimal. Dectin-1 is now known<br>
-31 -<br><br>
to be a universal receptor for β-glucan, and is found in many human tissues including monocytes and phagocytes. The gelling properties of high molecular weight β-glucan allows RNA, DNA and proteins to be embedded. Since sugars are highly resistant to acid conditions and enzymes, proteins, RNA and DNA remain protected during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Through the high affinity Dectin-1 receptor for (3-glucan, these substances can be introduced into the phagocytes as potential vehicles to the rest of the body.<br>
The pEGP-Cl vector (See Fig. 8) was purchased from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA) and prepared according to manufacturers' instructions. pEGFP-Cl encodes a red-shifted variant of wild-type GFP (1-3) which has been optimized for brighter fluorescence and higher expression in mammalian cells. (Excitation maximum = 488 nm; emission maximum = 507 nm.) The vector backbone also contains an SV40 origin for replication in mammalian cells only if they express the SV40 T-antigen. A bacterial promoter upstream of this cassette expresses kanamycin resistance in E. coli. The pEGFP-Cl backbone also provides a pUC origin of replication for propagation in E. coli and an fl origin for single-stranded DNA production.<br>
Mice were fed with 50 μg pEGFP-cl plasmid mixed into 400 μg<br>
beta-glucan (-200,000 Daltons) in 100 μl saline by oral gavage<br>
while control mice were given plasmid alone. Oral feeding was<br>
done for 3 consecutive days (days 1, 2 and 3) . 50 pi blood taken<br>
from tail vein were analysed by FCAS analysis after lysis of RBC<br>
and the % of GFP-expressing cells in the monocyte population were<br>
recorded.  The mean ratio of % green cells in glucan verus no<br>
glucan groups (n = 4-9 mice per group) is presented in figure<br>
9. Thoughout the 14 days of the experiment, % green monocytes<br>
in the no-glucan group remained stable at background levels. On<br>
the other hand, after day 1 of oral gavage, there was a consistent<br>
higher % of circulating green monocytes, which peaked around day<br>
-32-<br><br>
8. Since the GFP is not normally found in mouse monocytes, the presence of green cells is consistent with GFP protein expression following entry of the plasmid into the monocytes which circulate in the blood.<br>
The- experiment was repeated using barley p-glucan of higher molecular weight (-350,000 Daltons) with better gelling properties. In figure 10, similar kinetics was seen, with a higher percent of green cells that persisted from day 8 through day 11 (n=4 mice per group).<br>
Presence of GFP mRNA was tested using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis. Mice were fed with 50 μg pEGFP-cl plasmid mixed into 400 μg high molecular weight (-350,000 Daltons) beta-glucan in 100 μl saline by oral gavage while control mice were given plasmid alone. 50 μl peripheral blood was used to extract total RNA, reverse transcribed and quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a modification of the method previously described.4 The house keeping gene mouse GAPDH is used as internal control. Transcript level is calculated using a known GFP and GAPDH standard. Transcript units are calculated separately for GFP and GAPDH and results as a ratio of GFP over GAPDH. In figure 11, the mean RNA level (GFP/GAPDH) is expressed as a ratio of glucan versus no glucan groups (n=4,mice per group). GFP mRNA was detected up to day 10.<br>
