				<td>SELF-SUPPORTING OPTICAL FIBER SPOOL AND METHOD FOR THE<br>
PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to a glass-fibre spool and to a<br>
method for its production, according to the<br>
precharacterizing clause of Claim 1 and Claim 7,<br>
respectively.<br>
In a known glass-fibre spool of this type<br>
(US 5 493 627), a polymer resin dissolved in methane,<br>
for example polyvinyl acetate resin such as Vinac B15<br>
or a polyamide resin such as Elvamide 8063 resin from<br>
the Dupont Company, is used as the binding agent to<br>
stabilize the self-supporting winding. The<br>
concentration of the binding agent is chosen so as to<br>
achieve an adhesive force which ensures a sufficiently<br>
robust, self-supporting winding, from which the glass<br>
fibre can be unwound from the interior of the winding,<br>
without any risk of the glass fibre being kinked. The<br>
glass fibre is wound onto a winding former in a<br>
plurality of layers by machine, with the binding agent,<br>
dissolved in methanol, being applied to every fourth<br>
glass fibre layer by means of a brush during the<br>
winding process. Once the winding has been wound<br>
completely, the winding former is removed from the<br>
winding, and the binding agent cures slowly. The glass<br>
fibre spool with a length of 10.5 km of glass fibre<br>
wound on it is used to transmit information and data<br>
between an underwater vehicle and a projectile which<br>
can be deployed from the underwater vehicle, and is,<br>
for example, arranged in the underwater projectile,<br>
which is deployed from a submarine. During the<br>
deployment and during the movement of the projectile<br>
and/or of the underwater vehicle, the glass fibre is<br>
unwound from the winding.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a<br>
glass-fibre spool with a self-supporting winding, which<br>
can be unwound reliably from the innermost layer with a<br>
low tensile force and without loops being pulled off<br>
the winding, or the glass fibre becoming kinked and<br>
destroyed, during the unwinding process. Because of the<br>
underwater application, the winding to be unwound<br>
should not release any environmentally damaging<br>
substances during the process.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by<br>
the features of Claim 1.<br>
The glass-fibre spool according to the invention has<br>
the advantage that the use of a crossed-over winding<br>
technique to form the winding ensures that the glass<br>
fibre is unwound easily and reliably and that the glass<br>
fibre being unwound does not also tear off adjacent<br>
turns which are adhesively bonded to it, so that no<br>
loose loops are formed to impede the glass fibre being<br>
unwound from the binding interior. The impregnation<br>
substance that is used improves the cohesiveness of the<br>
winding and ensures during the unwinding process that<br>
the glass fibre is detached uniformly, without any<br>
jerking, from the adjacent turn. By virtue of its<br>
characteristics, the impregnation substance allows a<br>
simplified process to be used for its introduction into<br>
the winding, in that the winding is impregnated with<br>
the impregnation substance after the latter has been<br>
liquefied by heating, for example using a vacuum<br>
impregnation process. After solidification again, the<br>
impregnation substance has uniform physical<br>
characteristics, such as ductility, adhesion force and<br>
viscosity, in the normal operating temperature range<br>
for the glass fibre, which is between 0° and 40°C. The<br>
impregnation substance is solvent-free, has no<br>
reservations with regard to health, is not soluble in<br>
salt water, and is environmentally friendly.<br>
Expedient embodiments of the glass-fibre spool<br>
according to the invention as well as advantageous<br>
developments and refinements of the invention will<br>
become evident from the further Claims 2 to 6.<br>
One advantageous method for production of the glass-<br>
fibre spool is specified in Claim 7. Rotation of the<br>
glass fibre on itself while the crossed-over winding is<br>
being wound up ensures that the glass fibre has no<br>
twist when it is pulled off.<br>
Expedient embodiments of the method according to the<br>
invention as well as advantageous developments and<br>
refinements of the method will become evident from the<br>
further Claims 8 to 15.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the<br>
following text with reference to one exemplary<br>
embodiment, which is illustrated in the drawing. In<br>
this case, illustrated schematically, the drawing shows<br>
a longitudinal section through a glass-fibre spool.<br>
The glass-fibre spool, which is illustrated<br>
schematically in the form of a longitudinal section in<br>
the drawing, is used, for example, for data traffic<br>
between a submarine and a homing torpedo launched from<br>
the submarine. A glass-fibre spool such as this is<br>
arranged both in the torpedo and in the submarine, with<br>
the glass-fibre ends of the two glass-fibre spools<br>
being mechanically and optically connected to one<br>
another by means of an optical coupler. One such<br>
scenario is illustrated and described, for example, in<br>
EP 0 337 254 A2.<br>
As can be seen from the section illustration, the<br>
glass-fibre spool has a glass fibre 13 which is wound<br>
up to form a multilayer winding 12, for transmission of<br>
information and has a length of several kilometres. The<br>
initial twisting while the glass-fibre is being wound<br>
up ensures that the glass-fibre is not twisted as it<br>
runs out. The winding 12 is in the form of a crossed-<br>
over winding with crossing turns 20, as is known by way<br>
of example from thread spools. In order to illustrate a<br>
crossed-over winding such as this, the schematic<br>
longitudinal section shows a number of successive turns<br>
20, with that part of the turns 20 which is located at<br>
the front, although this cannot actually be seen<br>
because of the section location, being shown by dashed<br>
lines. The winding start 14 of the winding 12 is<br>
located at the start of the innermost turn layer, and<br>
the winding end 15 is located at the end of the<br>
outermost turn layer. The winding 12 has no winding<br>
former, but is designed to be self-supporting, by the<br>
individual turns 20 being fixed on one another by means<br>
of a suitable adhesive binding agent. An impregnation<br>
substance which is resistant to seawater, is chemically<br>
inert, can be liquefied by heat and is based on<br>
hydrocarbon is used as the binding agent. Examples of<br>
the impregnation substance are Vaseline, for example<br>
Zinke DAB10 or Merkur Type 641 wax or wax gel, for<br>
example Sasol Type Varagel 6527 , a mixture of Vaseline<br>
and high-melting-point waxes, for example Ceridust 3719<br>
or Ceridust 9325F from the Clariant company, in which<br>
case further additives can be mixed with them, a<br>
mixture of white oil and wax, for example WOP150PB from<br>
the Merkur company with a wax component of 25% to 30%<br>
Ceridust 3719, or a mixture of castor oil and calcium<br>
soap (calcium-12 hydroxystearate) with a castor-oil<br>
component of 85% to 95%. The phase transition<br>
temperature of all these substances, at which the phase<br>
or the aggregate state changes, that is to say the<br>
substances change from the solid phase to the liquid<br>
phase and vice versa, is above the normal operating<br>
temperature to which the winding 12 is subject. This<br>
operating temperature is normally 0° to 40°C.<br>
The self-supporting, dimensionally stable winding 12 is<br>
inserted into a hollow-cylindrical mould 16, which is<br>
surrounded by a metallic housing 17. The housing 17 is<br>
produced from sea-water-resistant aluminium and has<br>
openings 18, 19 on the end faces. The opening 18 is<br>
used for the glass fibre 13, which continues from the<br>
winding end 15, to pass through, and the coaxially<br>
arranged opening 19 is used for the glass fibre 13,<br>
which leads to the winding start 14, to pass through,<br>
and forms the outlet opening for the glass fibre 13 as<br>
it is being unwound. In this design, the glass fibre<br>
spool is inserted, for example, into a chamber in the<br>
stern of a torpedo, with the chamber being flooded via<br>
a water inlet. The glass fibre 13 runs centrally out of<br>
the winding 13 and is then guided in a guide tube until<br>
it emerges from the torpedo body, with the guide tube<br>
running centrally through the propulsion motor and the<br>
propulsion shaft of the torpedo, and projecting at the<br>
end beyond the torpedo propulsor. The glass fibre 13,<br>
which leads away from the winding end 15 and is passed<br>
out through the opening 19, is connected to a<br>
transmitting and receiving device, integrated in the<br>
torpedo body, for data traffic.<br>
The described glass-fibre spool is produced as follows:<br>
The long glass fibre 13 is wound by machine onto a<br>
winding former in a crossed-over winding configuration<br>
with a multiplicity of turn layers located one above<br>
the other. During the winding process, the glass fibre<br>
13 is tensioned, and the tensile force acting on the<br>
glass fibre 13 is reduced increasingly from winding of<br>
the inner turn layer to winding of the outermost turn<br>
layer. The tensile force can in this case be reduced<br>
continuously or discontinuously from one turn layer to<br>
the next. The tensile force is kept constant within one<br>
turn layer. This has the advantage that no light<br>
losses, or only negligibly small light losses, occur in<br>
the glass fibre 13 at the crossing points of the turns<br>
20, which represents slight kink points of the glass<br>
fibre 13, so that the attenuation in the transmission<br>
of information or data can be kept low. In order to<br>
avoid the possibility of the end turns 20 of the<br>
winding 12 sliding off during the winding process, the<br>
winding 12 has a number of turns 20 per winding layer<br>
that decreases from the inside outwards, so that the<br>
completed winding 12 has a trapezoidal shape when seen<br>
in a section along the winding axis, as can be seen<br>
from the drawing. The winding 12 may, of course, also<br>
be wound as a complete hollow cylinder.<br>
Once the glass fibre 13 has been wound completely, the<br>
winding 12, with the winding former left in it, is<br>
removed from the winding machine and is impregnated<br>
with the chemically inert, sea-water-resistant<br>
impregnation substance based on hydrocarbon, as has<br>
been described in various examples above, with the<br>
impregnation substance having previously been liquefied<br>
by heating to a temperature which is higher than the<br>
temperature at which the impregnation substance changes<br>
its phase or its aggregate state. In this case, this<br>
temperature is higher than 70°C. The winding 12, which<br>
is supported by the winding former, is impregnated, for<br>
example, by means of a vacuum impregnation process or<br>
in a plunge bath. Drips are then allow to fall off the<br>
impregnated winding 12 until a predetermined<br>
impregnation level is reached for the winding 12. This<br>
impregnation level is defined in such a way that the<br>
weight of the winding 12, as reduced by drips off it,<br>
is measured, and the dripping-off process is terminated<br>
on reaching a predetermined weight. The winding 12 is<br>
now cooled down to a temperature which is below its<br>
phase transition temperature, for example to room<br>
temperature. In consequence, the impregnation substance<br>
starts to solidify and changes back to its solid, gel-<br>
like state. While the winding 12 is cooling down, the<br>
winding former is aligned horizontally and is driven to<br>
rotate such that the impregnation substance, which is<br>
initially still liquid, is distributed uniformly in the<br>
winding 12. Once the winding 12 has cooled down, the<br>
winding former is removed.<br>
