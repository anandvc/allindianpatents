Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference should now be made to the drawings, in which the same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 through 4, a hydraulic control valve 100 according to the first embodiment of the present invention, includes a hose connector 110 clamped at opposite ends thereof to an end of a branch hose H/S and an end of a drip hose H/N, respectively. A water supply path is defined in the hose connector 110, and includes a larger-diameter path 120a having a stepped seat and a smaller-diameter path 120b.<br>
In this case, the stepped seat is manufactured in a form of an uneven seat 140 having a plurality of projections 141 and depressions 142 that are alternately arranged on an upper surface of the uneven seat 140. The hydraulic control valve 100 further includes a U-shaped flexible cup 200 and a support ring 300. The U-shaped flexible cup 200 is opened at a first end thereof. A flange 210 is outwardly protruded from an edge of the U-shaped flexible cup 200, and is stopped by the uneven seat 140 so that the U-shaped flexible cup 200 is fitted into the smaller-diameter path 120b while an outer surface of the U-shaped flexible cup 200 is spaced apart from the smaller-diameter path 120b by a predetermined gap P. The support ring 300 is fitted into an end of the larger-diameter path 120a to prevent the U-shaped flexible cup 200 from being undesirably removed.<br>
Further, an inward projecting step 150 is provided in the smaller-diameter path 120b to be inwardly projected from a wall of the smaller-diameter path 120b, and is placed near to a second end of the U-shaped flexible cup 200.<br>
The operation of the hydraulic control valve constructed in this way is as follows.<br>
That is, as shown in FIG. 5, a pressure of water fed from the branch hose H/S connected to the hose connector 110 acts on an interior of the U-shaped flexible cup 200. However, when the water pressure is low, the U-shaped flexible cup 200 is not be outwardly expanded, water passes through the depressions 140 of the uneven seat 140 and the gap P between the smaller-diameter path 120b and the outer surface of the U- shaped flexible cup 200. Thus, water having appropriate pressure is fed to the drip hose H/N.<br><br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 6, when the water pressure is high, the water pressure acts on the interior of the U-shaped flexible cup 200, while expanding the U- shaped flexible cup 200 outward.<br>
As a result, the U-shaped flexible cup 200 is outwardly expanded. Simultaneously, the outer surface of the U-shaped flexible cup 200 comes into close contact with an inner circumference of the smaller-diameter path 120b, and the second end of the U- shaped flexible cup 200 comes into contact with the inward projecting step 150, thus preventing water from passing through the depressions 142 of the uneven seat 140.<br>
As such, the hydraulic control valve of the present invention is constructed to feed a predetermined amount of water when the water pressure is low, and to prevent the flow of water when the water pressure rapidly increases, thus preventing the drip hose H/N from being damaged, and preventing any waste of water, therefore being economical.<br>
FIGS. 7 through 11 show a hydraulic control valve according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The hydraulic control valve according to the second embodiment is operated contrary to that of the first embodiment. That is, the control valve of the second embodiment is constructed to prevent the flow of water when water pressure is low, and to feed a predetermined amount of water when the water pressure is high.<br>
A plurality of grooves 143 are longitudinally provided on an inner circumference of the smaller-diameter path 120b of the hose connector 110 to be connected to the depressions 142. In this case, each of the grooves 143 is longer than the U-shaped flexible cup 200. Further, the hydraulic control valve further includes a holder 310.<br>
The holder 310 is fitted into an end of the larger-diameter path 120a, and passes through an opening of the U-shaped flexible cup 200 to be in close contact with an inner surface of the U-shaped flexible cup 200. Another water supply path 320 is provided along a central axis of the holder 310.<br>
The operation of the hydraulic control valve according to the second embodiment is as follows. That is, as shown in FIG. 12, water is fed from the branch hose H/S through the water supply path 320 of the holder 310 into the U-shaped flexible cup 200.<br>
When fed water has a low pressure, the U-shaped flexible cup 200 is not expanded outward, thus preventing the flow of water.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 13, when fed water has a high pressure, the U-shaped flexible cup 200 is expanded outward, and water flows backward through a gap between an outer surface of the holder 310 and the U-shaped flexible cup 200. Thus, the water flows along the depressions 142 of the uneven seat 140 and the grooves 143 which are longitudinally arranged to be aligned with the depressions 142.<br><br>
The hydraulic control valve according to the second embodiment can be utilized at a space where the water supply is allowed only when water pressure is relatively high.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a hydraulic control valve for agricultural drip hoses, which controls a water pressure to keep the flow of water constant regardless of the water pressure, thus preventing the drip hose from being damaged by high-pressure water, reducing manufacturing costs thereof due to a simple structure, and enhancing reliability of a product due to minimized malfunction.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
