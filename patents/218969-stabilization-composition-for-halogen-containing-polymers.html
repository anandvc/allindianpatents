Stabilisation composition for halogen-containing polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a stabiliser composition for halogen-containing polymers and polymer mixtures, comprising a carrier material of the general formula CaxAl2(OH)2(x-2)HP03 • m H:0. wherein x is a number from 2 to 12 and m is a number from 0 to 12. and a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts, at least oriQ salt of a halosen-containins oxv acid being present in finely distributed form on the carrier material, to a process for the preparation thereof and to the use thereof.<br>
Halogen-containing, thermoplastic resin compositions or moulded articles produced therefrom are degraded or decomposed by the action of heat or light. It is therefore necessary to add stabilisers to such resins. For particularly demanding articles, such as profiles, plates or tubes, there are customarily used for this purpose inorganic and/or organic compounds of toxic heavy metals such as .lead-barium or cadmium. For the stabilisation of e.g. hard PVC articles, where good thermal stability and good resistance to light and weathering are required, dibasic lead phosphite has gained particular importance. For example, DD-B 61 095 mentions the use of basic lead phosphite as a stabiliser against the degradation of PVC by heat; a different use of basic lead phosphite for PVC hard foam mixtures is described in US-B 4 797 426.	Because basic lead phosphite, like other heavy-metal-containing stabilisers, is classified as toxic, attempts are being made to find alternative stabilisers. A large number of combinations of inorganic and organic compounds are known as stabilisers for halogen-containing, thermoplastic resins.<br>
JP-B 1 213 865 and JP-A 80 445/813 propose a hydrotalcite as stabiliser. That<br>
substance is superior to mixtures of Ca/Zn metal soaps in terms of heat stability<br>
and transparency, but the use of hydrotalcite does not solve the problem of<br>
discoloration of the resin during processing.	*   -<br>
In accordance with JP-A 80 444/82 it is proposed to overcome that problem by using combinations of hydrotalcite and 1.3-diketone compounds.<br><br>
EP 0 930 332 A2 relates to stabiliser combinations comprising aminouracils and at least one further substance selected from a range of aluminium, lithium and calcium-aluminium compounds. A disadvantage, however, is that the described stabilisers do not satisfy all demands in respect of thermal stability and initial colour.<br>
EP 0 506 831 Bl relates to basic calcium-aluminium hydroxyphosphites and to their use as stabilisers for halogen-containing polymers. The stabilisers described in the said publication do not, however, exhibit the desired activity in all the required areas.<br>
DE 100 56 880 Al and DE 100 38 721 Al relate to stabiliser compounds for halogen-containing organic plastics. The production of the stabilised products is in each case effected by homogenising and plasticising a PVC powder mixture and the formulation components mentioned in the printed specifications for 5 min. at 170°C. (However, the content of sodium perchlorate obtained from the described formulations lies within a range that does not have sufficient activity.J<br>
The problem underlying the invention was therefore to provide novel stabiliser impositions, and a process for the preparation thereof, that are suitable especially as stabilisers for halogen-containing polymers but do not exhibit the ibove-mentioned disadvantages of the known stabilisers and, especially, that are ;lassified as non-toxic. A further problem underlying the invention was to provide stabiliser compositions that broaden the user's scope for formulation to the effect hat he can dispense with the additives required according to the prior art, such as sine salts or aminouracils, without any appreciable deterioration of the result. A ^articular problem underlying the present invention was to provide novel stabiliser compositions, and a process for the preparation thereof, that are suitable especially as stabilisers for soft PVC, hard PVC and PVC hard foam (free foam, Deluka foam).<br>
t has now been found that calcium-aluminium hydrogen phosphites, when loaded vith a finely distributed salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid, especially with a<br><br>
perchlorate salt, exhibit excellent stabilising properties for halogen-containing polymers.<br>
The problems underlying the invention are therefore solved by stabiliser compositions and processes for their preparation as described in greater detail in the context of the following text.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a stabiliser composition for halogen-containing polymers, comprising a carrier material of the general formula (I) CaxAl2(OH)2<x m h2o wherein x is a number from to and salt of halosen-containing oxv acid or mixture two more such salts at least one halogen-containing oxy being present in finely distributed form on the carrier material.></x>
Stabiliser compositions in accordance with the present invention have at least one carrier material, there being used as carrier material calcium-aluminium hydroxyphosphites of the general formula (I) CaxAl2(OH)2(X+2)HP03 • m H2O (I). wherein x is a number from 2 to 8 and m is a number from 0 to 12.<br>
A "stabiliser composition" is to be understood in the context of the present invention as being a composition that can be used for stabilising halogen-containing polymers. For achieving that stabilising effect, a stabiliser composition according to the invention is generally mixed with a halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised and then processed. It is equally possible, however, for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to be mixed with the halogen-containing polymer during processing.<br>
The term "carrier material" is to be understood as being a material that can have, at least on the surface, a compound other than the carrier material which is present in finely distributed form on the carrier material. The expression "on the carrier material" is to be interpreted as meaning that at least^ a major portion of the compound present on the carrier material adheres firmly to the carrier material as a result of interactions between the carrier material and the compound. The interactions can essentially be anv interactions: for examnle ionic electrostatic<br><br>
covalent or Van der Waals forces or two or more such interactions simultaneously may provide adhesion to the carrier material.<br>
In the formula I above, x is preferably a number from 3 to 6 and m is preferably a number from 2 to 4. Experiments using X-ray diffraction have shown that the compounds used according to the invention as carrier materials do not belong to the hydrotalcite type in respect of their crystal structure.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the compositions according to the invention comprising calcium-aluminium hydrogen phosphites and salts of halogen-containing oxy acids impart to halogen-containing, thermoplastic resins and to the moulded articles produced therefrom thermal stabilities comparable to basic lead phosphites. The compounds according to the invention prevent discoloration during the production of e.g. hard PVC moulded articles: the colour retention and stability to weathering of the moulded articles stabilised with the compounds according to the invention is also equivalent to products stabilised with toxic heavy metal compounds.<br>
It has also been found that the use of the compositions according to the invention achieves excellent results also in the absence of commonly used co-stabilisers such as zinc salts or aminouracils. The present invention therefore relates both to compositions which may contain such co-stabilisers and to compositions which are free of zinc salts or free of aminouracils or free of zinc salts and aminouracils.<br>
For the preparation of the calcium-aluminium hydroxyphosphites used according to the invention as carrier materials, for example mixtures of calcium hydroxide and/or oxide, aluminium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide or of calcium hydroxide and/or oxide and sodium aluminate are reacted with phosphorous acid in amounts suitable for the preparation of the desired compounds in an aqueous medium and the reaction product is separated and obtained in a manner known per se.<br>
The reaction product directly obtained from the reaction described above can be separated from the aqueous reaction medium by known methods, preferably by<br><br>
filtration. The working-up of the separated reaction product is likewise effected in a manner known perse, for example by washing the filter cake with water and drying the washed residue at temperatures of for example. 60-130c, preferably at90-120°C.<br>
For the reaction there can be used either a finely particulate, active aluminium hydroxide in combination with sodium hydroxide or a sodium aluminate. Calcium can be used in the form of finely particulate calcium oxide or hydroxide or mixtures thereof. The phosphorous acid can be used in various concentrations.<br>
The reaction temperatures are preferably between about 50 and 100°C, preferably between about 60 and 85°C.Catalysts or accelerators are not required. In the case of the compounds according to the invention, some or all of the water of crystallisation can be removed by thermal treatment.(When used as stabilisers^ the dried calcium-aluminium hydroxyphosphites used according to the invention do not split off water at the processing temperatures of J 60-200°C customary, for example, for hard PVC, so that no troublesome bubble formation occurs in the moulded articles.<br>
To improve their dispersibility in halogen-containing thermoplastic resins, the compounds according to the invention can be coated with surface-active agents in known manner.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention has at least two constituents. In addition to a carrier material as first constituent, a stabiliser composition according to the invention also comprises at least one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention preferably comprises at least one inorganic or organic salt,of perchloric acid.<br>
Examples of suitable inorganic perchlorates are those of the general formula M(C104)k, wherein M is Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn, Al, La or Ce.<br><br>
Suitable organic perchlorates are especially the onium salts of perchlorates, as described below. In the context of this text, the term "onium salt" denotes a compound that is an ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium salt. An "onium salt" in accordance with the present invention is an organic onium salt. That means that the ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium group of the onium salt carries at least one organic radical. An onium salt may carry 1. 2, 3 or 4 organic radicals according to the nature of the onium salt. The organic radicals can be bonded to the onium radical, for example, by way of a C-X linkage, where X is S, N or P. It is equally possible, however, for the organic radicals to be bonded to the onium radical by way of a further hetero atom, for example an O atom.<br>
An onium perchlorate suitable for use in the context of the present invention has at least one positively charged N, P er -S atom or two or more such positively charged N, P or S atoms or mixtures of two or more of the mentioned, positively charged, atoms.<br>
In the context of the present invention, as onium perchlorates there are used compounds that carry at least one organic radical and at most the maximum possible number of organic radicals on the N, S or P .atom. When an onium perchlorate suitable for use according to the invention carries a smaller number of organic radicals than is necessary for the formation of a positively charged onium ion, the positive charge is generated in a customary manner known to the person skilled in the art by protonation by means of a suitable acid, so that the onium perchlorate in question then carries at least one proton in addition to an organic radical.<br>
It is therefore possible according to the invention to use as onium perchlorates compounds having a positive charge as a result of protonation reactions. It is, however, equally possible in the context of the stabiliser combinations according to the invention to use onium perchlorates having a positive charge as a result of a peralkylation reaction. Examples of such compounds are tetraalkylammonium, trialkylsulfonium and tetraalkylphosphonium perchlorates. It is, however, also Drovided in the context  of the present invention for a oeralkvlated  onium<br><br>
perchlorate suitable for use according to the invention to have an aryl. alkaryl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or cycloaikenyl radical. It is likewise possible and provided according to the invention for an onium salt suitable for use in the context of a stabiliser composition according to the invention to have two or possibly more different types of subsiituent, for example an alkyl radical and a cycloalkyl radical or an alkyl radical and an aryl radical.<br>
It is likewise possible and provided in the context of the present invention for an onium salt suitable for use in a stabiliser composition according to the invention to have substituents that are themselves substituted by one or more functional groups. The term "functional groups" denotes groups that improve the activity of the stabiliser composition or at least do not impair that activity or impair it only to a negligible extent. Such functional groups can be, for example, NH groups, NH? groups. OH groups, SH groups, ester groups, ether groups, thioether groups, isocyanurate groups or keto groups or mixtures of two or more thereof.<br>
Phosphonium perchlorates suitable for use in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds that, by appropriate reaction of suitable reactants, result in a phosphonium perchlorate. Phosphonium perchlorates suitable for use according to the invention can be obtained, for example, by appropriate reaction of tetraalkyl-, tetracycloalkyl- or tetraaryl-phosphorus halides. Suitable phosphonium perchlorates are therefore derived, for example, from tetraalkylphosphorus salts, such as tetra-n-ethylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-propyl-phosphonium bromide, tetra-n-butylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-isobutyl-phosphonium bromide, tetra-n-pentylphosphonium bromide, tetra-n-hexyl-phosphonium bromide and like tetraalkylphosphorus salts. Also suitable in principle for use in the context of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are phosphonium perchlorates derived, for example, from tetracyclo-alkylphosphorus salts or tetraarylphosphorus salts. Suitable phosphonium perchlorates are therefore based, for example,  on tetracycloalkyl- or tetraarylphosphorus salts such as tetracyclohexylphosphonium bromide or tetraphenyl-phosphonium bromide and like tetracycloalkyl- or tetraaryl-phosphorus salts. The compounds mentioned above can be unsubstituted in the context of the present<br><br>
invention, but they may also have one or more of the above-mentioned substituents provided that, in the context of the stabiliser composition, those substituents have no disadvantageous activity and have no adverse effect on the intended use of the stabiliser composition.<br>
Also suitable for use in the context of the present invention are organic phos-phonium perchlorates that carry at a phosphorus atom different types of organic substituents which may optionally be differently substituted.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, tetra-n-butylphosphonium perchlorate or triphenylbenzylphosphonium perchlorate is used as phosphonium perchlorate.<br>
Sulfonium perchlorates suitable for use in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds that, by appropriate reaction of suitable reactants, result in a sulfonium perchlorate. Sulfonium perchlorates suitable for use according to the invention can be obtained, for example, by appropriate reaction of sulfides such as alkyl monosulfides, alkyl disulfides, dialkylsulfides or poly-alkylsulfides. Suitable sulfonium perchlorates are therefore derived, for example, from dialkyl sulfides such as ethyl benzyl sulfide, allyl benzyl sulfide or alkyl disulfides such as hexane disulfide, heptane disulfide, octane disulfide and like alkyl disulfides. Also suitable in principle for use in the context of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are sulfonium perchlorates derived, for example, from tricycloalkylsulfonium salts or triarylsulfonium salts. Suitable sulfonium perchlorates are therefore based, for example, on tricycloalkyl- or triaryl-sulfonium salts such as tricyclohexylsulfonium bromide or triphenyl-sulfonium bromide and like tricycloalkyl- or triaryl-sulfonium salts. Also suitable are trialkyl-, triaryl- or tricycloalkyl-sulfoxonium salts such as trimethylsulfox-onium perchlorate. The compounds mentioned above can be unsubstituted in the context of the present invention, but they may also have one or more of the above-mentioned substituents provided that, in the context of the stabiliser composition, those substituents have no disadvantageous activity and have no adverse effect on the intended use of the stabiliser composition.<br><br>
Also suitable for use in the context of the present invention are organic sulfonium perchlorates that carry at a sulfur atom different types of organic substituents which may optionally be differently substituted.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, trimethyl-sulfoxonium perchlorate is used as sulfonium perchlorate.<br>
Ammonium perchlorates suitable for use in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds that, by appropriate reaction of suitable reactants. result in an ammonium perchlorate. Ammonium perchlorates suitable for use in accordance with the invention can be obtained, for example, by appropriate reaction of amines or amides such as alkyl monoamines, alkylenediamines, alkyl polyamines, or secondary or tertiary amines. Suitable ammonium perchlorates are therefore derived, for example, from primary mono- or poly-amino compounds having from 2 to about 40 carbon atoms, for example from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms. Examples thereof are ethylamine, n-propylamine, isopropylaminer n-butylamine, sec-butylamine, tert-butylamine, and substituted amines having from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, such as 2-(N.N-dimethylamino)-l-aminoethane. Suitable diamines have, for example, two primary, two secondary, two tertiary or one primary and one secondary or one primary and one tertiary or one secondary and one tertiary amino group(s). Examples thereof are diaminoethane, the isomeric diaminopropanes, the isomeric diaminobutanes, the isomeric diamino-hexanes, piperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, amino-3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-tri-methylcyclohexane (isophoronediamine, IPDA), 4,4'-diaminodicyciohexyi-methane, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, aminoethylethanolamine, hydrazine, hydrazine hydrate or triamines such as diethylenetriamine or 1,8-diamtno-4-amino-methyloctane or tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tributylamine, trihexyl-amine, triheptylamine, trioctylamine, dimethylbenzylamine, N-ethyl-, N-methyl-, N-cyclohexyl-morpholine, dimethylcyclohexylamine, dimorpholinodiethyl ether, l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, l-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octane, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-ethylenediamine, N,N,N,N--tetramethylbutanediamine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-hexane-1,6-diamine,    pentamethyldiethylenetriamine,    tetramethyldiaminoethyl<br><br>
ether, bis(dimethylaminopropyl)urea. N,N'-dimethylpiperazine, 1,2-dimethyl-imidazole or di(4-N,N-dimethylaminocyclohexyl)methane.<br>
Especially suitable and preferred in the context of the present invention are aliphatic amino alcohols having from 2 to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, for example triethanolamine. tripropanolamine, triisopropanolamine, tributanolamine. tri-tert-butanolamine. tripentanolamine, 1-amino-3,3-dimethyi-pentan-5-ol, 2-aminohexane-2',2"-diethanolamine, 1-amino-2,5-dimethylcyclohexan-4-ol, 2-aminopropanoL 2-aminobutanol, 3-amino-propanol, l-amino-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol. 5-aminopentanol. 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanol, 1 -amino- 1-cyclopentane-methanol. 2-amino-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol, 2-(dimethylaminoethoxy)-ethanoh and aromatic-aliphatic or aromatic-cycloaliphatic amino alcohols having from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, there being used as aromatic structures heterocyclic or isocyclic ring systems such as naphthalene derivatives or. especially, benzene derivatives, such as 2-aminobenzyl alcohol, 3-(hydroxymethyl)aniline, 2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol, 2-amino-l-phenylethanoI, 2-phenylglycinol or 2-amino-l-phenyl-l,3-propanediol and also mixtures of two or more such compounds.<br>
Within the scope of a further embodiment of the present invention the ammonium perchlorates used are perchlorates of heterocyclic compounds having a cyclic ring system containing amino groups.<br>
For example, there are used the perchlorates of heterocyclic amino alcohols that have at least 2, preferably at least 3, amino groups in the ring. As central ring component of the ammonium perchlorates suitable for use according to the invention there are especially suitable the trimerisation products of isocyanates.<br>
There are suitable, for example, hydroxyl-group-containing isocyanurates of the general formula II<br><br><br>
wherein the groups Y and the indices m are in each case identical or different and m is an integer from 0 to 20 and Y is a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. In the context of the present invention special preference is given to the use of tris(hydroxymethyl)isocyanurate (THEIC) as constituent of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention.<br>
Also suitable as ammonium perchlorates are, for example, compounds in which the amino group is bonded to a substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic system, for example aminobenzoic acid, aminosalicylic acid or aminopyridinecarboxylic acid and suitable derivatives thereof.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention there are used as ammonium perchlorates 2-ethylcarboxypyridinium perchlorate. form-amidinium perchlorate, tetra-n-butylphosphonium perchlorate. trimethylsulf-oxonium perchlorate, the perchlorate salt of trishydroxyethyl isocyanurate, the perchlorate salt of 2-(diethylamino)-ethanol, of triethanolamine or of triisoprop-anolamine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholinium perchlorate or trioctylammonium perchlorate or mixtures of two or more thereof.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention in the context of the present invention may, for example, comprise only one of the above-mentioned onium perchlorates. In the context of the present invention it is equally possible and also provided for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to comprise a mixture of two or more of the above-mentioned onium perchlorates. It may be a mixture of two or more different types of onium perchlorates, that is to say. for<br><br>
example, a mixture of ammonium perchlorates and sulfonium perchlorates or ammonium perchlorates and phosphonium perchlorates or sulfonium perchlorates and phosphonium perchlorates or ammonium perchlorates and sulfonium perchlorates and phosphonium perchlorates. It is equally possible in the context of the invention for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to comprise a mixture of two or more onium perchlorates of one type, that is to say a mixture of two or more ammonium perchlorates and a mixture of two or more sulfonium perchlorates and a mixture of two or more phosphonium perchlorates.<br>
For example, a stabiliser composition according to the invention may in the context of the present invention comprise only one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid. It is, however, equally possible and provided in the context of the present invention for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to comprise a mixture of two or more salts of halogen-containing oxy acids. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises at least sodium perchlorate.<br>
The salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts is present according to the invention in finely distributed form on the carrier material. The term "finely distributed" is to be understood as requiring that discrete particles of the salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or of a mixture of two or more such salts are present on the carrier material, insofar as such discrete particles are present or identifiable at all, do not exceed an average particle size of 10 jim. The term is preferably to be interpreted as meaning that, as a whole, particularly in the case of the salt, the particle size does not exceed 10 μm, especially 5 μm or 1 μm. Customary methods, such as light microscopy or electron microscopy, can be used for determining the particle size.<br>
As already stated above, the expression "on the carrier material" is to be interpreted as meaning that at least a major portion of the compound present on the carrier material adheres firmly to the carrier material as a result of interactions between the carrier material and the compound. The interactions can essentially be any interactions; for example ionic, electrostatic, covalent or Van der Waals<br><br>
forces or two or more such interactions simultaneously may provide adhesion to the carrier material.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention therefore comprises a mixture of a carrie material and a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid in which a maximum of 10 °/ by weight of at least one salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid is separable fron the carrier material by simple mechanical separation methods, for example b; screening. "Simple mechanical separation methods" are to be understood in th context of this text as being separation methods in which substantially only particles present separately from one another or only weakly adhering to one another prior to carrying out the separating method are separated.<br>
In addition to comprising a salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts that are present in finely distributed form on a carrier material, a stabiliser composition according to the invention may also comprise another salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid or a mixture of two or more such salts that in the sense of the above definition are not present in finely distributed form on the carrier material.<br>
For example, less than 10 % by weight of the salts of the halogen-containing oxy acid or of the mixture of two or more such salts, insofar as the salts can be present in crystalline form, may have crystallites of a size of more than 30 μm or more than 20 μm or more than 10 μm. It follows that at least 90 % by weight of such salts have crystallites of a size of less than 30 μm or less than 20μm or less than 10 μm.<br>
The average particle size in the above-mentioned case preferably lies within a range of from about 0.5 to about 30 μn, for example from about 1 to about 20 μm.<br>

The ratio of salt or salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid to carrier material can be arranged essentially as desired within limits specified in view of the desired stabilisation result. When a stabiliser composition according to the invention is to comprise exclusively a salt or such a mixture of two or more salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid present on a carrier material insofar as the carrier material is to have the desired amount of salt or salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid in the sense of the above definition, the ratio should be such that the amount of salt or salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid can still be taken up by the carrier material without there being proportions of salt or salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid present separately from the carrier material.<br>
For example, in the context of the present invention the ratio of salt or salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid to carrier material should be from 1:100 to 1:1.<br><br>
