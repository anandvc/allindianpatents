				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a dynamically modular processing unit. In particular, the present invention relates to providing a modular processing unit that is configured to be selectively used alone or with similar processing units in an enterprise. In some implementations, each modular processing unit includes a non-periphera! based encasement, a cooling process (e.g., thermodynamic convection cooling, forced air, and/or liquid cooling), an optimized circuit board configuration, optimized processing and memory ratios, and a dynamic back plane that provides increased flexibility and support to peripherals and applications.<br>
2.	Background and Related Art<br>
Technological advancements have occurred over the years with respect to computer related technologies. For example, computer systems once employed vacuum tubes. The tubes were replaced with transistors. Magnetic cores were used for memory. Thereafter, punch cards and magnetic tapes were commonly employed. Integrated circuits and operating systems were introduced. Today, microprocessor chips are currently used in computer systems.<br>
The evolution of computer related technologies has included the development of various form factors in the computer industry. One such standard form factor was referred to as Advanced Technology ("AT"), which ran considerably faster than prior systems and included a new keyboard, an 80286 processor, a floppy drive that had a higher-capacity (1.2MB) than prior systems and a 16-bit data bus.<br>
Over time, improvements were made to the AT form factor that included a change in the orientation of the motherboard. The improvements allowed for a more efficient design of the motherboard by locating disk drive connectors closer to drive bays and the central processing unit closer to the power supply and cooling fan. The new location of the central processing unit allowed the expansion slots to all hold full-length add-in cards.<br>
While the developments increased the processing ability, the techniques have<br>
only been marginally effective in their ability to upgrade components as the computer<br><br>
technology advances. In fact, the techniques have become increasingly less desirable as a delivery mechanism for computer technologies. Predictable failure patterns have been identified in terms of operating durability, manufacturing, shipping, and support. The systems generate heat, which requires internal cooling systems that are noisy. Moreover, current computer systems are prone to requiring repair.<br>
Thus, while computer technologies currently exist that are configured for use in processing data, challenges still exist. Accordingly, it would be an improvement in the art to augment or even replace current techniques with other techniques.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a dynamically modular processing unit. In particular, implementation of the present invention takes place in association with a modular processing unit that is lightweight, compact, and is configured to be selectively used alone or with similar processing units in an enterprise. In some implementations, each modular processing unit includes a non-peripheral based encasement, a cooling process (e.g., thermodynamic convection cooling, forced air, and/or liquid cooling), an optimized circuit board configuration, optimized processing and memory ratios, and a dynamic back plane that provides increased flexibility and support to peripherals and applications.<br>
In one implementation, a dynamically modular processing unit is a cube platform (e.g., a 3l/2-inch (8.9 cm) cube platform or another size and/or configuration) that utilizes an advanced cooling process (e.g., a thermodynamic cooling model that eliminates any need for a cooling fan, a forced air cooling process and/or a liquid cooling process). The unit also includes a layered motherboard configuration, and optimized processing and memory ratios. The bus architecture of the unit enhances performance and increases both hardware and software stability. A highly flexible back plane provides support to peripherals and vertical applications. Other implementations of the present invention embrace the use of a durable and dynamically modular processing unit that is greater than or less than a 31/2-inch cube platform. Similarly, other implementations embrace the use of shapes other than a cube.<br>
Implementation of the present invention provides a platform that may be employed in association with all types of computer enterprises. The platform allows for a plethora of modifications that may be made with minimal impact to the dynamically modular unit, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the platform across all type of<br>
application		 <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a dynamically modular processing unit. In particular, embodiments of the present invention take place in association with a modular processing unit that is lightweight, compact, and is configured to be selectively used alone or oriented with one or more additional processing units in an enterprise. In some embodiments, a modular processing unit includes a non-peripheral based encasement, a cooling process (e.g., thermodynamic convection cooling, forced air, and/or liquid cooling), an optimized layered printed circuit board configuration, optimized processing and memory ratios, and a dynamic back plane that provides increased flexibility and support to peripherals and applications.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention embrace a platform that may be employed in association with all types of computer and/or electrical enterprises. The platform allows for a plethora of modifications that may be made with minimal impact to the dynamic modular unit, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the platform across all types of applications. Moreover, as indicated above, the modular processing unit may function alone or may be associated with one or more other modular processing units in a customizable enterprise to provide enhanced processing capabilities.<br>
Figure 1 and the corresponding discussion are intended to provide a general description of a suitable operating environment in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As will be further discussed below, embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of one or more dynamically modular processing units in a variety of customizable enterprise configurations, including in a networked or combination configuration, as will be discussed below.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention embrace one or more computer readable media, wherein each medium may be configured to include or includes thereon data or computer executable instructions for manipulating data. The computer executable instructions include data structures, objects, programs, routines, or other program modules that may be accessed by one or more processors, such as one associated with a general-purpose modular processing unit capable of performing various different functions or one associated with a special-purpose modular processing unit capable of performing a limited number of functions.<br><br>
Computer executable instructions cause the one or more processors of the enterprise to perform a particular function or group of functions and are examples of program code means for implementing steps for methods of processing. Furthermore, a particular sequence of the executable instructions provides an example of corresponding acts that may be used to implement such steps.<br>
Examples of computer readable media include random-access memory ("RAM"), read-only memory ("ROM"), programmable read-only memory ("PROM"), erasable programmable read-only memory ("EPROM"), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory ("EEPROM"), compact disk read-only memory ("CD-ROM"), any solid state storage device (e.g., flash memory, smart media, etc.), or any other device or component that is capable of providing data or executable instructions that may be accessed by a processing unit.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a representative enterprise includes modular processing unit 10, which may be used as a general-purpose or special-purpose processing unit. For example, modular processing unit 10 may be employed alone or with one or more similar modular processing units as a personal computer, a notebook computer, a personal digital assistant ("PDA") or other hand-held device, a workstation, a minicomputer, a mainframe, a supercomputer, a multi-processor system, a network computer, a processor-based consumer device, a smart appliance or device, a control system, or the like. Using multiple processing units in the same enterprise provides increased processing capabilities. For example, each processing unit of an enterprise can be dedicated to a particular task or can jointly participate in distributed processing.<br>
In Figure 1, modular processing unit 10 includes one or more buses and/or interconnect s) 12, which may be configured to connect various components thereof and enables data to be exchanged between two or more components. Bus(es)/interconnect(s) 12 may include one of a variety of bus structures including a memory bus, a peripheral bus, or a local bus that uses any of a variety of bus architectures. Typical components connected by bus(es)/interconnect(s) 12 include one or more processors 14 and one or more memories 16. Other components may be selectively connected to bus(es)/interconnect(s) 12 through the use of logic, one or more systems, one or more subsystems and/or one or more I/O interfaces, hereafter referred to as "data manipulating system(s) 18." Moreover, other components may be externally connected to bus(es)/interconnect(s) 12 through the use of logic, one or more systems, one or more<br><br>
subsystems and/or one or more I/O interfaces, and/or may function as logic, one or more systems, one or more subsystems and/or one or more I/O interfaces, such as modular processing unit(s) 30 and/or proprietary device(s) 34. Examples of I/O interfaces include one or more mass storage device interfaces, one or more input interfaces, one or more output interfaces, and the like. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention embrace the ability to use one or more I/O interfaces in id/or the ability to change the usability of a product based on the logic or other data manipulating system employed.<br>
The logic may be tied to an interface, part of a system, subsystem and/or used to perform a specific task. Accordingly, the logic or other data manipulating system may allow, for example, for IEEE1394 (firewire), wherein the logic or other data manipulating system is an I/O interface. Alternatively or additionally, logic or another data manipulating system may be used that allows a modular processing unit to be tied into another external system or subsystem. For example, an external system or subsystem that may or may not include a special I/O connection. Alternatively or additionally, logic or other data manipulating system may be used wherein no external I/O is associated with the logic. Embodiments of the present invention also embrace the use of specialty logic, such as for ECUs for vehicles, hydraulic control systems, etc. and/or logic that informs a processor how to control a specific piece of hardware. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention embrace a plethora of different systems and/or configurations that utilize logic, systems, subsystems and/or I/O interfaces.<br>
As provided above, embodiments of the present invention embrace the ability to use one or more I/O interfaces and/or the ability to change the usability of a product based on the logic or other data manipulating system employed. For example, where a modular processing unit is part of a personal computing system that includes one or more I/O interfaces and logic designed for use as a desktop computer, the logic or other data manipulating system may be changed to include flash memory or logic to perform audio encoding for a music station that wants to take analog audio via two standard RCAs and broadcast them to an IP address. Accordingly, the modular processing unit may be part of a system that is used as an appliance rather than a computer system due to a modification made to the data manipulating system(s) (e.g., logic, system, subsystem, I/O interface(s), etc.) on the back plane of the modular processing unit. Thus, a modification of the data manipulating system(s) on the back plane can change<br><br>
the application of the modular processing unit.    Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention embrace very adaptable modular processing units.<br>
As provided above, processing unit 10 includes one or more processors 14, such as a central processor and optionally one or more other processors designed to perform a particular function or task. It is typically processor 14 that executes the instructions provided on computer readable media, such as on rnemory(ies) 16, a magnetic hard disk, a removable magnetic disk, a magnetic cassette, an optical disk, or from a communication connection, which may also be viewed as a computer readable medium.<br>
Memory(ies) 16 includes one or more computer readable media that may be configured to include or includes thereon data or instructions for manipulating data, and may be accessed by processors) 14 through bus(es)/interconnecl(s) 12. Memory(ies) 16 may include, for example, ROM(s) 20, used to permanently store information, and/or RAM(s) 22, used to temporarily store information. ROM(s) 20 may include a basic input/output system ("BIOS") having one or more routines that arc used to establish communication, such as during start-up of modular processing unit 10. During operation, RAM(s) 22 may include one or more program modules, such as one or more operating systems, application programs, and/or program data.<br>
As illustrated, at least some embodiments of the present invention embrace a non-peripheral encasement, which provides a more robust processing unit that enables use of the unit in a variety of different applications. In Figure 1, one or more mass storage device interfaces (illustrated as data manipulating system(s) 18) may be used to connect one or more mass storage devices 24 to bus(es)/interconnect(s) 12. The mass storage devices 24 are peripheral to modular processing unit 10 and allow modular processing unit 10 to retain large amounts of data. Examples of mass storage devices include hard disk drives, magnetic disk drives, tape drives and optical disk drives.<br>
A mass storage device 24 may read from and/or write to a magnetic hard disk, a<br>
removable magnetic disk, a magnetic cassette, an optical disk, or another computer<br>
readable medium. Mass storage devices 24 and their corresponding computer readable<br>
media provide nonvolatile storage of data and/or executable instructions that may<br>
include one or more program modules, such as an operating system, one or more<br>
application programs, other program modules, or program data. Such executable<br>
instructions are examples of program code means for implementing steps for methods<br>
disclosed herein.	 <br>
Data manipulating system(s) 18 may be employed to enable data and/or instructions to be exchanged with modular processing unit 10 through one or more corresponding peripheral I/O devices 26. Examples of peripheral I/O devices 26 include input devices such as a keyboard and/or alternate input devices, such as a mouse, trackball, light pen, stylus, or other pointing device, a microphone, a joystick, a game pad, a satellite dish, a scanner, a camcorder, a digital camera, a sensor, and (he like, and/or output devices such as a monitor or display screen, a speaker, a printer, a control system, and the like. Similarly, examples of data manipulating system(s) 18 coupled with specialized logic that may be used to connect the peripheral I/O devices 26 to bus(es)/interconnect(s) 12 include a serial port, a parallel port, a game port, a universal serial bus ("USB"), a firewire (IEEE 1394), a wireless receiver, a video adapter, an audio adapter, a parallel port, a wireless transmitter, any parallel or serialized I/O peripherals or another interface.<br>
Data manipulating system(s) 18 enable an exchange of information across one or more network interfaces 28. Examples of network interfaces 28 include a connection that enables information to be exchanged between processing units, a network adapter for connection to a local area network ("LAN") or a modem, a wireless link, or another adapter for connection to a wide area network ("WAN"), such as the Internet. Network interface 28 may be incorporated with or peripheral to modular processing unit 10, and may be associated with a LAN, a wireless network, a WAN and/or any connection between processing units.<br>
Data manipulating system(s) 18 enable modular processing unit 10 to exchange information with one or more other local or remote modular processing units 30 or computer devices. A connection between modular processing unit 10 and modular processing unit 30 may include hardwired and/or wireless links. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention embrace direct bus-to-bus connections. This enables the creation of a large bus system. It also eliminates hacking as currently known due to direct bus-to-bus connections of an enterprise. Furthermore, data manipulating system(s) 18 enable modular processing unit 10 to exchange information with one or more proprietary I/O connections 32 and/or one or more proprietary devices 34.<br>
Program modules or portions thereof that are accessible to the processing unit may be stored in a remote memory storage device. Furthermore, in a networked system or combined configuration, modular processing unit 10 may participate in a distributed<br><br>
computing environment where functions or tasks are performed by a plurality of<br>
processing    units.	Alternatively,    each    processing    unit     of    a    combined<br>
configuration/enterprise may be dedicated to a particular task. Thus, for example, one processing unit of an enterprise may be dedicated to video data, thereby replacing a traditional video card, and provides increased processing capabilities for performing such tasks over traditional techniques.<br>
While those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention may comprise a variety of configurations, reference is made to Figure 2, which illustrates a representative embodiment of a durable and dynamically modular processing unit, hi the illustrated embodiment of Figure 2, processing unit 40 is durable and dynamically modular. In the illustrated embodiment, unit 40 is a 3V2-inch (8.9 cm) cube platform that utilizes an advanced thermodynamic cooling model, eliminating any need for a cooling fan.<br>
However, as provided herein, embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of other cooling processes in addition to or in place of a thermodynamic cooling process, such as a forced air cooling process and/or a liquid cooling process. Moreover, while the illustrated embodiment includes a 3]/2-inch cube platform, those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of a modular processing unit that is greater than or less than a 3'/2-inch cube platform. Similarly, other embodiments embrace the use of shapes other than a cube.<br>
Processing unit 40 also includes a layered motherboard configuration, that optimizes processing and memory ratios, and a bus architecture that enhances performance and increases both hardware and software stability, each of which will be further discussed below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments of the present invention also embrace non-layered motherboards. Moreover, other embodiments of the present invention embrace embedded motherboard configurations, wherein components of the motherboard are embedded into one or more materials that provide an insulation between components and embed the components into the one or more materials, and wherein one or more of the motherboard components are mechanical, optical, electrical or electro-mechanical. Furthermore, at least some of the embodiments of embedded motherboard configurations include mechanical, optical, electrical and/or electro-mechanical components that are fixed into a three-dimensional,<br><br>
sterile environment.   Examples of such materials include polymers, rubbers, cpoxies, and/or any non-conducting embedding compound(s).<br>
Embodiments of the present invention embrace providing processing versatility. For example, in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, processing burdens are identified and then solved by selectively dedicating and/or allocating processing power. For example, a particular system is defined according to specific needs, such that dedication or allocation of processing power is controlled. Thus, one or more modular processing units may be dedicated to provide processing power to such specific needs (e.g., video, audio, one or more systems, one or more subsystems, etc.). In some embodiments, being able to provide processing power decreases the load on a central unit. Accordingly, processing power is driven to the areas needed.<br>
While the illustrated embodiment, processing unit 40 includes a 2HGz processor and 1.5GB of RAM, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of a faster or slower processor and/or more or less RAM. In at least some embodiments of the present invention, the speed of the processor and the amount of RAM of a processing unit depends on the nature for which the processing unit is to be used.<br>
A highly dynamic, customizable, and interchangeable back plane 44 provides support to peripherals and vertical applications. In the illustrated embodiment, back plane 44 is selectively coupled to encasement 42 and may include one or more features, interfaces, capabilities, logic and/or components that allow unit 40 to be dynamically customizable. In the illustrated embodiment, back plane 44 includes DVI Video port 46, Ethernet port 48, USB ports 50 (50a and 50b), SATA bus ports 52 (52a and 52b), power button 54, and power port 56. Back plane 44 may also include a mechanism that electrically couples two or more modular processing units together to increase the processing capabilities of the entire system as indicated above, and to provide scaled processing as will be further disclosed below.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that back plane 44 with its corresponding features, interfaces, capabilities, logic and/or components are representative only and that embodiments of the present invention embrace back planes having a variety of different features, interfaces, capabilities and/or components. Accordingly, a processing unit is dynamically customizable by allowing one back plane to be replaced by another<br><br>
back plane in order to allow a user to selectively modify the logic, features and/or capabilities of the processing unit.<br>
Moreover, embodiments of the present invention embrace any number and/or type of logic and/or connectors to allow use of one or more modular processing units 40 in a variety of different environments. For example, the environments include vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.), hydraulic control systems, and other environments. The changing of data manipulating system(s) on the back plane allows for scaling vertically and/or horizontally for a variety of environments, as will be further discussed below.<br>
Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention embrace a variety of shapes and sizes of modular processing units. For example, in Figure 2 modular processing unit 40 is a cube that is smaller than traditional processing units for a variety of reasons.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, embodiments of the present invention are easier to support than traditional techniques because of, for example, materials used, the size and/or shape, the type of logic and/or an elimination of a peripherals-based encasement.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, power button 54 includes three states, namely on, off and standby for power boot. When the power is turned on and received, unit 40 is instructed to load and boot an operating system supported in memory. When the power is turned off, processing control unit 40 will interrupt any ongoing processing and begin a shut down sequence that is followed by a standby state, wherein the system waits for the power on state to be activated.<br>
USB ports 50 are configured to connect peripheral input/output devices to processing unit 40. Examples of such input or output devices include a keyboard, a mouse or trackball, a monitor, printer, another processing unit or computer device, a modem, and a camera.<br>
SATA bus ports 52 are configured to electronically couple and support mass storage devices that are peripheral to processing unit 40. Examples of such mass storage devices include floppy disk drives, CD-ROM drives, hard drives, tape drives, and the like.<br>
As provided above, other embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of additional ports and means for connecting peripheral devices, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art.    Therefore, the particular ports and means for<br><br>
'reconnecting specifically identified and described herein are intended to be illustrative only and not limiting in any way.<br>
As provided herein, a variety of advantages exist through the use of a non-peripheral processing unit over larger, peripheral packed computer units. By way of example, the user is able to selectively reduce the space required to accommodate the enterprise, and may still provide increased processing power by adding processing units to the system while still requiring less overall space. Moreover, since each of the processing units includes solid-state components rather than systems that are prone to breaking down, the individual units may be hidden (e.g., in a wall, in furniture, in a closet, in a decorative device such as a clock).<br>
The durability of the individual processing units/cubes allows processing to take place in locations that were otherwise unthinkable with traditional tecliniques. For example, the processing units can be buried in the earth, located in water, buried in the sea, placed on the heads of drill bits that drive hundreds of feet into the earth, on unstable surfaces in furniture, etc. The potential processing locations are endless. Other advantages include a reduction in noise and heat, an ability to provide customizable "smart" technology into various devices available to consumers, such as furniture, fixtures, vehicles, structures, supports, appliances, equipment, personal items, etc.<br>
With reference now to Figure 3, another view of the embodiment of Figure 2 is provided, wherein the view illustrates processing unit 40 with the side walls of the cube removed to more fully illustrate the non-peripheral based encasement, cooling process (e.g., thermodynamic convection cooling, forced air, and/or liquid cooling), optimized layered circuit board configuration, and dynamic back plane. In the illustrated embodiment, the various boards are coupled together by using a force fit technique, which prevents accidental decoupling of the boards and enables interchangeability. The boards provide for an enhanced EMI distribution and/or chip/logic placement. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention embrace any number of boards and/or configurations. Furthermore, board structures may be modified for a particular benefit and/or need based on one or more applications and/or features. In Figure 3, processing unit 40 includes a layered circuit board/motherboard configuration 60 that includes two parallel sideboards 62 (62a and 62b) and a central board 64 transverse to and electronically coupling sideboards 62. While the illustrated embodiment provides a tri-board configuration, those skilled in the art will appreciate<br><br>
that embodiments of the present invention embrace board configurations having less than three boards, and layered board configurations having more than three boards. Moreover, embodiments of the present invention embrace otlicr configurations of circuit boards, other than boards being at right angles to each other.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the layered motherboard 60 is supported within encasement 42 using means for coupling motherboard 60 to encasement 42. In the illustrated embodiment, the means for coupling motherboard 60 to encasement 42 include a variety of channeled slots that are configured to selectively receive at least a portion of motherboard 60 and to hold motherboard 60 in position. As upgrades are necessary with the advancing technology, such as when processor 66 is to be replaced with an improved processor, the corresponding board {e.g., central board 64) is removed from the encasement 42 and a new board with a new processor is inserted to enable the upgrade. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention have proven to facilitate upgrades as necessary and to provide a customizable and dynamic processing unit.<br>
Processing unit 40 also includes one or more processors that at are configured to perform one or more tasks. In Figure 3, the one or more processors are illustrated as processor 66, which is coupled to central board 64. As technology advances, there may be a time when the user of processing unit 40 will want to replace processor 66 with an upgraded processor. Accordingly, central board 64 may be removed from encasement 42 and a new central board having an upgraded processor may be installed and used in association with unit 40. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention embrace dynamically customizable processing units that are easily upgraded and thus provide a platform having longevity in contrast to traditional techniques.<br>
With reference now to Figure 4, a representative enterprise 70 is illustrated,<br>
wherein a dynamically modular processing unit 40 having a non-peripheral based<br>
encasement, is employed alone in a personal computing enterprise. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, processing unit 40 includes power connection 71 and employs wireless<br>
technology with the peripheral devices of enterprise 70. The peripheral devices include<br>
monitor 72 having hard disk drive 74, speakers 76, and CD ROM drive 78, keyboard 80<br>
and mouse 82. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present<br>
invention also embrace personal computing enterprises that employ technologies other<br>
than wireless technologies.	 <br>
Processing unit 40 is the driving force of enterprise 70 since it provides the processing power to manipulate data in order to perform tasks. The dynamic and customizable nature of the present invention allows a user to easily augment processing power. In the present embodiment, processing unit 40 is a 3!/2-inch (8.9 cm) cube that utilizes thermodynamic cooling and optimizes processing and memory ratios. However, as provided herein, embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of other cooling processes in addition to or in place of a thermodynamic cooling process, such as a forced air cooling process and/or a liquid cooling process. Furthermore, while the illustrated embodiment includes a 3V2-inch cube platform, those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of a modular processing unit that is greater than or less than a 3'A-inch cube platform. Similarly, other embodiments embrace the use of shapes other than a cube.<br>
In particular, processing unit 40 of the illustrated embodiment includes a 2GHz processor, 1.5G RAM, a 512 L2 cache, and wireless networking interfaces. So, for example, should the user of enterprise 70 determine that increased processing power is desired for enterprise 70, rather than having to purchase a new system as is required by some traditional technologies, the user may simply add one or more modular processing units to enterprise 70. The processing units/cubes may be selectively allocated by the user as desired for performing processing. For example, the processing units may be employed to perform distributive processing, each unit may be allocated for performing a particular task (e.g., one unit may be dedicated for processing video data, or another task), or the modular units may function together as one processing unit.<br>
While the present example includes a processing unit that includes a 2GHz processor, 1.5G RAM, and a 512 L2 cache, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments of the present invention embrace the use of a faster or slower processor, more or less RAM, and/or a different cache. In at least some embodiments of the present invention, the capabilities of the processing unit depends on the nature for which the processing unit will be used.<br>
While Figure 4 illustrates processing unit 40 on top of the illustrated desk, the robust nature of the processing unit/cube allows for unit 40 to alternatively be placed in a non-conspicuous place, such as in a wall, mounted underneath the desk, in an ornamental device or object, etc. Accordingly, the illustrated embodiment eliminates traditional towers that tend to be kicked and that tend to produce sound from the cooling<br><br>
system inside of the tower. No sound is emitted from unit 40 as all internal components are solid states when convection cooling or liquid cooling is employed.<br>
With reference now to Figure 5, another example is provided for utilizing a modular processing unit in a computing enterprise. In Figure 5, an ability of modular processing unit 40 to function as a load-bearing member is illustrated. For example, a modular processing unit may be used to bridge two or more structures together and to contribute to the overall structural support and stability of the structure or enterprise, hi addition, a modular processing unit may bear a load attached directly to a primary support body. For example, a computer screen or monitor may be physically supported and the processing controlled by a modular processing unit. In the illustrated embodiment, monitor 90 is mounted to modular processing unit 40, which is in turn mounted to a stand 92 having a base 94.<br>
With reference now to Figure 6, another representative enterprise is illustrated, wherein a dynamically modular processing unit 40 having a non-peripheral based encasement, is employed computing enterprise. In Figure 6, the representative enterprise is similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, however one or more modular peripherals are selectively coupled to the enterprise. In particular, Figure 6 illustrates mass storage devices 93 that are selectively coupled to the enterprise as peripherals. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any number (e.g., less than two or more than two) and/or type of peripherals may be employed. Examples of such peripherals include mass storage devices, I/O devices, network interfaces, other modular processing units, proprietary I/O connections; proprietary devices, and the like.<br>
With reference now to Figure 7, another representative embodiment is illustrated, wherein a dynamically modular processing unit 40 having a non-peripheral based encasement, is employed in an enterprise. In accordance with at least some embodiments of the present invention, a modular processing unit having a non-peripheral based encasement may be employed in a central processing unit or in other electronic devices, including a television, a stereo system, a recording unit, a set top box, or any other electronic device.

In Figure 8, the I/O peripheral 97 is a slide on pieces that is selectively coupled to modular processing unit 40, which includes a non-layered board design to allow unit 40 to be more slender. Additional peripherals include a power source and mass storage device. In one embodiment, the mass storage device is a 40G hard drive that enables the user to always have all of his/her files. Accordingly, the embodiment of Figure 8 enables a user to employ a complete computer in the palm of his/her hand. Moreover, because of the solid state components, the embodiment of Figure 8 is more durable than traditional techniques. Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, the casing includes metal to increase the durability. Accordingly, if unit 40 is dropped, the core will not be broken.<br>
With reference now to Figure 9, another representative enterprise is illustrated that includes a dynamically modular processing unit 40 having a non-peripheral based encasement. In Figure 9, processing unit 40, having an I/O peripheral 97, is selectively coupled to peripheral 98 to allow the representative enterprise to function as a high-end laptop computer. Utilizing a liquid cooling technique, for example, processing unit 40 can be a very powerful handheld machine. And, as illustrated in Figure 9, unit 40 may be selectively inserted like a cartridge into a large I/O peripheral 98, which includes a keyboard, monitor, speakers, and optionally logic depending on end user application. Once unit 40 is decoupled/ejected from peripheral 98, unit 40 can retain the files to allow the user to always have his/her files therewith. Accordingly, there is no need to synchronize unit 40 with peripheral 98 since unit 40 includes all of the files. While the<br><br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 9 includes one modular processing unit, other embodiments of the present invention embrace the utilization of multiple processing units.<br>
Similarly, modular processing unit 40 may be inserted or otherwise coupled lo a variety of other types of peripherals, including an enterprise in a vehicle, at home, at the office, or the like. Unit 40 may be used to preserve and provide music, movies, pictures or any other audio and/or video.<br>
