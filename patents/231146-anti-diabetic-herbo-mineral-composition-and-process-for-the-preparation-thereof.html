ANTI-DIABETIC HERBO-MINERAL COMPOSITION (S)<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a novel anti-diabetic herbo-minerai composition (s) used in treatment of weakness and control of diabetes. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetic mellitus is a syndrome characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism, associated with an absolute or related deficiency in insulin secretion and/or insulin action. WHO has declared India as the "Diabetic Capital of the World". More than half of diabetics (53%) are above 60 years and more than 85% are above 45 years. In India the prevalence of Diabetes is 11% between 65-69 years age. Diabetic can accelerate cell aging by a number of subcellular events like hyperglycemia, increase sorbital pathway, oxidation stress with damage to cellular organelles, production of advanced glycosylation end products and increased activity of diacyl glycerol protein kinase C pathway with accelerated production of cell damaging cytokines. The more patients understand about the disease the better they are enabled to make good decisions on its management. Dietary therapy and exercise are critical both in preventing and managing diabetic mellitus and the results of the diabetic prevention program research group indicate that changes in life style reduced the incidence of diabetic by 58% (Knowier et al., 2002). In type 1 diabetic mellitus, where there is an absolute deficiency of insulin replacement forms a major component of treatment. In type 2 diabetic mellitus, insulin release from the pancreas is altered and may also be absolutely deficient in amount, and therefore its replacement also plays a part in management, especially when diabetic mellitus has been present for a long time. As the number of people with diabetes multiply world wide, the disease takes an ever-increasing proportion of national and international health care budgets. It is projected to become one of the world's main disablers within the next 25<br><br>
years. It is very popularly known in medical history as "silent killer". Regions with greatest potential are Asia and Africa, where diabetes mellitus rates could rise to two to three-folds than the present rates. Apart from currently available therapeutic options, many herbal/minearal medicines have been recommended for the treatment of diabetes. The development of scientifically validated models of streptozocin induced- diabetic is vital to the analysis of the functional consequences of pancreatic damage and to testing the recovery efficacy of potentially therapeutic drugs. The role of medicinal plants or mineral products increasing the secretion of insulin and acting as an anti-diabetic formulation in the form of tablet is still much underestimated. The retrieval hypothesis postulates the streptozocin agents disrupt the pancreas function as the effect of streptozocin agents diminish over time by the treatment of our present herbal formulation investigation resulted in the reappearance of normal functioning of pancreas. Drugs like glibenclamide, penformin-containing substances which have a stimulant activity on diabetic and the adverse side effects or synthetic molecules can not be ruled out. Tinospora cordifolia along with bhasmas was used in synergistic combination to form a pharmaceutically effective formulation.<br>

As a result of intensive study conducted by the inventors with the aim of achieving aforementioned objectives, new formulations for oral ingestion were developed employing herbal drugs, which are from natural origin, incorporating them into binders and diluents to form oral dosage forms. Accordingly, the present investigation deals with the oral dosage form formulation(s). Each formulation has been described in detail giving the formula of the ingredients along with the method of preparation. The first step in the preparation of these formulations involves a process for making, the plant material suitable for formulating into a tablet/ capsule. The specified portion of the plant is collected and dried under shade at room temperature (25 -35°C) for 72 hours or until the material gets dried. The material is then powdered into a fine powdered. A specified amount of the powdered material is then extracted exhaustively with 50 % aqueous alcohol at room temperature (25-35 °C).  Extraction was carried out in a closed<br><br>
container immersing specified amount of the plant material in specified solvent (1:8-1:15 ratio) for 4-7 days. At the end of this stage, solvent is decanted and filtered if necessary to make it free from plant debris. The solvent is then concentrated by evaporating under vacuum at less than 40-60 °C. The concentrate is then freeze dried to obtain final product in powder form. The final product is then made into oral dosage form by using it as an ingredient for making tablets and capsules. Suitable binders like starch and diluents like lactose are added to make up the formulation.<br><br>
Tinospora cordifolia was collected and dried in shade. The dried material (lKg) is then powdered and extracted with distilled water/hydro alcoholic extract (3 L) for 5 days. At the end of this, the solvent is decanted and filtered if necessary to remove the plant debris. The extract is then concentrated under vacuum at less than 50 °C. Then the extract is lyophilized to obtain the extract in powder form. 15 g of starch is mixed with water and<br><br>
heated to form a paste. The weighed quantities of the plant extract and bahamas were mixed are then blended with starch paste and then lactose is added quantity sufficient to make 100 g. The ingredients are then mixed properly with the starch paste to form a mass. The mass is then granulated in a granulator and then the dry at 104 °F and screen through 16-mesh screen. Talc is added to the dried granules and then they are punched in the tablet-punching machine to form uniform tablets.<br>
