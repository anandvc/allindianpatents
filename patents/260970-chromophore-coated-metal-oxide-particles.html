				<td>Chromophore coated metal oxide particles<br>
The present invention relates to novel UV filters, a process for the preparation and their use especially In formulations for the protection of human skin or hair against harmful effects of sunlight. The novel UV filters are metal oxide particles which are coated with a mixture of crossllnkable monomers comprising at least one type of crossllnkable chromophores.<br>
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population that is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. Repetitive sun exposure can result in skin changes known as photoaged skin. The clinical changes that are seen in photoaged skin differ from those of normally aged skin in sunlight protected sites of the body. Among the damaging results of intensive sun exposure of the skin there is increased wrinkling, elastosls, pigmentary changes, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions.<br>
Many sun screening chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effect of UV-A (320 to 400 nm) or UV-B (290-320 nm) wavelength and even shorter wavelength (UV-C). Very recently a new class of sun screening chemicals, the broadband UV-filters have been developed which shield the skin from UV-A and UV-B radiation. These chemicals are usually incorporated either alone or in combination with -each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used.<br>
Most UV filters used in cosmetic or dermatological compositions are monomeric compounds, and thus there is the inherent risk that such compounds can penetrate the skin barrier, which is highly undesirable. UV filters on the basis of polysiloxanes which may be either linear or cyclic are described e.g. in WO 93/04665, WO 94/06404, EP-A 538 431, EP-A 392 883 and EP-A 358 584. With these polysiloxanes the risk of skin penetration Is lower, but it Is sometimes difficult to incorporate the polysiloxanes in cosmetic or dermatological compositions due to incompatibility problems which differ depending on the UV-active chromophores which are covalently bonded to the polysiloxanes.<br>
EP-A 1 205 178 and EP-A 1 205 177 suggest to reduce the risk of penetration of active ingredients such as UV filters into the skin and possible damage of the skin or allergies caused thereby by immobilizing the active ingredients or UV filters present in a dermatological or cosmetic composition. These documents disclose a conjugate which<br>
comprises an anorganic pigment and an active ingredient on the basis of an organic compound which Is covaiently bonded via a spacer group to the anorganic pigment. The conjugate disclosed in these documents thus contains an anorganic pigment and to the surface of thfs pigment chromophores are chemically bonded.<br>
Apart from carbon-based chromophores metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide are widely used in sunscreenlng agents. This action Is substantially based on the reflection, scattering and absorption of harmful UV radiation and is substantially dependent upon the primary particle size of the metal oxide.<br>
However, incorporation of metal oxfde In sunscreen compositions can cause significant problems, in particular because many metal oxides such as titanium dioxide sr zinc oxide tend to agglomerate in many finished formulations leading to a toss in their efficacy as sun-screening agent and resulting in an unacceptable aesthetic'appearance due to a so-catfed 'whitening effect' when applied to the skin. Furthermore, the metal oxides such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide show formulation incompatibilities when used in combination with other usual ingredients of cosmetic or dermatological formulations. Especially unwanted are incompatibilities with other UV-sunscreens such as dibenzoylmethane derivatives (e.g. 4,4'-Methoxy-ieitbutyldibenzoylmethane) resulting amongst others in a coloration of the formulation which is highiy undesirable. Additionally, untreated metal oxides are known to have photocatalytic activity through which reactions are triggered which may lead to changes of components of sunscreening agents or cause skin irritations.<br>
Various coatings have been proposed for modifying the surface of the metal oxide In order to ease the incorporation into the formulation, to avoid the formulation incompatibilities and to reduce the photocatalytic activity such as e.g. simethicone, methicone and triethoxy caprylylsilane and sllfcium dioxide e.g. described in EP-A 1 281 388 and DE-A 103 33 029. In particular In view of their photocatalytic activity it has been suggested to coat the metal oxide particles with an inorganic coating which is not degenerated by a photocatalytic reaction. Coatings on the basis of calcinated alumina and of other oxides are known, EP-A 988 853, EP-A 1 284 277, and US-A 5,562,897 disclose silica coated metal oxide powders.<br>
While these coatings solve some problems associated with the use of metal oxide particles as UV absorbing or scattering particles in sunscreen compositions, there is.still need for improved coated metal oxide particles, in particular for UV absorbing and/or scattering<br>
particles which allow a wide variability regarding the range of UV light which they absorb or scatter while nevertheless avoid the manifold problems occurring after incorporation of those UV absorbing particles into cosmetic ordermatoioglcal compositions.<br>
There is a need to provide UV filters which do not show the shortcomings of the prior art UV filters, They should have excellent UV filter activity, being easily accessible and compatible with the other usual ingredients of cosmetic and dermatological compositions and with other UV-sunscreens (or UV-filter, both terms are used interchangeably) e.g. such as dlbenzoylmsthane derivatives.<br>
For solving these problems the present invention for the first time provides novel UV filter particles which combine both the advantages of coated metai oxide particles and the advantages of chromophores on carbon basis which have excellent UV filter activity over a broad wavelength independent of the particle size. With these novel UV filter particles sunscreen formulations with high SPF values can be generated while avoiding the disadvantages of the prior art metal oxide particles and the prior art chromophores on-carbon basis. Surprisingly, it was also found that the metal oxides of this invention additionally stabilize dibenzoylmethane derivatives such as 4,4'~Methoxy-tertbutyldibenzoylmethane against degradation upon irradiation which are well known ,to have a limited photostability.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a process for producing novel coated metal oxide particles, wherein metal oxide particles are coated with at least one type of crosslinkable chromophore with UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C filter and/or broadband activity and optionally at least one type of crosslinkable monomer which does not have UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C and/or broadband filter activity. The present invention also provides the novel coated metal oxide particles obtainable by this process and cosmetic or derrnatologica! compositions comprising those coated metaf.oxide particles and the use of the coated metal oxide particles for producing cosmetic or dermatological compositions especially sunscreen compositions. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for the stabilization of dibenzoylmethane derivatives against degradation upon irradiation.<br>
Preferably in the process for producing the coated metal oxide particles eccording to the present invention both crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity, either one or mixtures of crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity having UV-A and/or UV-B<br>
and/or UV-C and/or broadband filter activity and crosslinkable monomers which do not have UV filter activity are present so that the final coating of the metal oxide particles Is composed of units from crossllnkabfe monomers with no UV filter activity ancf of units from crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity.<br>

wherein R' is hydrogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain C1-20-alkyl, -alkoxy or C2-20-alkenyl.<br>
Preferably, the crosslinkable chromophore with UV filter activity is obtainable by reacting a silane molecule, e.g. of the formula Si(R)r(Q)qS, wherein R is a hydrolysable group as defined above, in particular an alkoxy group or an acyloxy group with 10 carbon atoms or less, Q is a non-hydrolysable group as defined above, in particular a CrCs alkyl group, e.g. methyl, S is a-reactive group which can react with the chromophore, in particular a hydrogen atom, a group -(CH2)0-NCOj a group -(CHZ}0-CI or a group -(CH2)0-NH2l r is 2 or 3, q Is 0 or 1 and o is 1 to 6, such as<br>

wherein Alk is a G1-C8 alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl,<br>
with a chromophore selected e.g. from<br>
(Figure Removed) wherein R' is hydrogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain C1-20-alkyl, -alkoxy or C2-20-alkenyl without being limited thereto.<br>
It is also possible to prepare the crosslinkable chromophores by polymerizing one or more of the hydrolysable metal or semi-metal oompounds, in particular the silane compounds mentioned above with each other or with other monomers such as the crosslinkable monomers with no UV filter activity defined below and then with a chromophore as defined<br>
above. In this case the crosslinkable chromophore is an oligomer which comprises one or more of the UV filter active moieties A. Usually such an oligomer is constituted from 50 monomer units or less, preferably from 20 monomer units or less, more preferably of 10 monomer units or less. Preferably such an oligomeric crosslinkable chromophore comprises 5 or less UV filter active moieties A, more preferably 3 or less, most preferably 1 UV filter active moiety A.<br>
The crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity can be used for coating of the metal oxide particles per se or they can be used together with crosslinkable monomers which do not have UV filter activity. Preferably, the crosslinkable chromophores with UV filter activity are used together with crosslinkable monomers without UV filter activity, because this easily allows to adjust the amount of UV filter active moieties in the final coating. Alternatively, it lis also possible to adjust the amount of UV filter active moieties in the final coating by using oligomers which have been prepared from monomers with UV filter activity and monomers with no UV filter activity as discussed above,<br>
The crosslinkable monomers with no UV filter activity are preferably compounds of the formula M(R)n(Q)q, wherein M is a metallic or semi-metallic element such as silicon, titanium, zinc, aluminum or zirconium, preferably silicon, R is a hydrolysable substituent as defined above, preferably with not more than 10 carbon atoms, such as an alkoxide, an aryioxide, carboxylic ester, acyloxy group, diketonato group, hydrolysable aza group or a chlorine atom, preferably an alkoxide, an aryloxide or an acyloxy group, more preferably an alkoxide or an aryloxy group with 10 carbon atoms or less, in particular a Ci-C8 alkoxide, most preferably methoxide or ethoxide, and n is an integer from 2 to 4, preferably 3 or 4. Q is as defined above, preferably octyl and q is 0 or 1, n+q=3 or 4, preferably 4.<br>
Particularly preferred are crosslinkable monomers such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), tetramethpxysilane (TEMOS), methyltriethoxysilane (METEOS), octyltrimethoxysilane (OTEO'S) or partially hydrolyzed and/or partially condensed polymers (oligomers) thereof or a mixture of the above. Suitable crosslinkable monomers are also disclosed e.g. in EP-A 216278.<br>
It-is possible that the coated metal oxide particles of the present invention contain two or more types of chromophores without the risk that there Is an inactivation between the chromophore moieties, because the chromophore moieties are covalently bonded to the<br>
coating and therefore the risK of contact between the chromophore moieties is low, in a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention one or two kinds of crosslinkable chromophores are present In the coating, most preferably together with at least one kind of crosslinkable monomer which does not have any UV filter activity. The coated metal oxide particles of the present invention thus preferably contain one or two different kinds of UV filter active moieties A as defined above, in a preferred embodiment only one kind of chromophore moieties as defined above In a ratio of 1:50 to 10:1, more preferably of 1:5 to 1:30 to the crosslinkable mo/iomer which does not have any UV filter activity. The ratio Is based on a weight by weight basis.<br>
The process for preparing "the coated metal oxide particles of the present invention Is not particularly restricted. All types of metal oxide particles which are'principally"known to"be" suitable for cosmetic or dermatological compositions can be used in the process, in particular particles of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zirconium oxide, iron oxide, cerium oxide and mixtures of these metal oxides. Furthermore, mixtures of these metal oxides with aluminum oxide and/or silicon dioxide can be used. The origin of the metal oxides is not particularly limited. Metal oxides can be prepared via a pyrogenic process, a sol-gel process, a grinding process, a plasma process, a precipitation process, a hydrothermal process or by a mining process or a combination of the above mentioned processes, to mention only the most common processes for preparing metal oxide particles. Titanium dioxide or Zinc oxide as well as mixtures of these metals oxides with aluminium oxide or with silicon dioxide are preferred.<br>
The metal; oxide particles which can be used in the coating process are either commercially available as e.g. pyrogenic titanium dioxide P25 from Degussa or can be prepared by methods known by a skilled person. Chemical mixtures of pyrogenic oxides can be prepared as described e.g. in EP-A 850 876. Examples of titanium silicon mixed oxides and titanium aluminium mixed oxides are disclosed In EP-A 609 533 and examples for silicon aluminium mixed oxides are disclosed e.g. in EP-A 1 064 617. The disclosure of these documents with respect to preferred metal oxide particles to be coated according to the<br>
•s<br>
present invention are explicitly included herein by reference.<br>
The crystalline form of the metal oxide may be of any crystal or amorphous type. For example, titanium dioxide may be any type of amorphous, rutil, anastase, brookite or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
Particularly preferred are the metal oxides titanium dioxide or zinc oxide eventually doted with iron oxide.<br>
The particle size of the particles to be coated according to the process of the present invention In not particularly limited. All particle sizes which are principally useful for incorporating into cosmetic or dermatoiogical compositions can be coated with the coating composition according to the process of the present invention.<br>
The coating of the metal oxide particles can be carried out by methods well known to a skilled person and described in the prior art and it can explicitly be referred to the methods disclosed in EP-A 988 853, In EP-A1 284 277, in EP 581 651, in US 5 562 897 and in US"5 756 788. Preferred are sol-gel processes.<br>
During the coating process the crosslinkable groups react to form a crosslinked polymer which forms the coating layer on the metal oxide particles.<br>
An exemplary process for the coating of the metal oxide particles according io the present invention comprises the dispersion of the metal oxide particles in a suitable solvent, preferably in water with or without an emulsifier so that the dispersion comprises usually 1 to 80 wt.% of the metal oxide particles. To this dispersion a base or an inorganic acid is added under agitation, e.g. stirring and the crosslinkabje chromophores and optionally the other crosslinkable monomers are added to the dispersion. Depending on the intended thickness of the coating the weight to weight ratio of crosslinkable monomers to metal oxide is usually between 0.005 and 1 more preferably between 0.01 and 0,3. The reaction product, the coated metal oxide particles, is separated and optionally washed and dried. The separation of the reaction product can be performed by usual processes such as filtration or centrifugation. The washing can be a washing with water or a suitable organic solvent or mixtures of water with organic solvent.<br>
The coated metal oxide particles according to the invention can be dried using known methods such as those disclosed In Ullmann's Encyclopaedia of Industrial Chemistry. Other process steps can follow, such as calcinations, grinding procedures, granulation procedures or dispersion of the coated metal oxide particles In suitable liquids.<br>
The temperature of the coating reaction is not critical. With water as a reaction medium the temperature Is usually in the range of 10° to 80° C, preferably 40-80°C.<br>
The quantity of base or acid required for the coating reaction Is not critical and the best suitable amount of base or add can be found by simple routine experiments. EP-A 1 284 277 mentions an amount of base In the range of 0.1 to 30 wt.% relative to the total reaction medium and in most cases this range Is also suitable for the process of the present Invention. A particularly suitable base or acid concentration is from 1 to 5 wt,%.<br>
The base is not particularly restricted and the same bases can be used which are known from EP-A 1 284 277 such as ammonia, hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or tetraalKylammonium hydroxide, carbonates such as ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate, organic bases such as amines, pyridines, anilines or guanidine, ammonium salts of carboxylfc acids such as ammonium formate or ammonium acetate, alkyl ammonium salts of carboxylic acids such as monornethylamln formate or dirnethylamin formate and mixtures thereof.<br>
Particularly preferred are ammonia, ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium formate, ammonium acetate, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate and mixtures of two or more of those bases.<br>
In addition to bases or instead of bases inorganic acids such as for example hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid and organic acids such as formic acid or acetic acid can be used'or addedif this facilitatesthe coating reaction.<br>
In another process the metal oxides can be coated without using a solvent as e.g. described in US 5 756 788.<br>
The primary particle size of the coated metal oxide particles Is usually In the range from 2 to 100 nm, preferably (n the range of 5 to 50 nm and the secondary particle size is preferably between 0.05 and 50 |Jm, preferably between 0.1 and 1 urn."<br>

Preparation of the crosslinkable chromophore<br>
Example 1<br>
2-(4-Hydroxybenzylidene)malonic acid diethyl ester<br>
A 250 ml round bottom flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, a Dean stark trap and an oil bath with a magnetic stirrer was charged with 10 g (81 mmol) 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 150 ml toluene, 0.97 ml (10 mmol) of piperidine and 0.8 g (6.5 mmol) benzoic acid are added, and the reaction is heated to 45°C. Then, 13.7 ml (90 mmol) diethyl malonate in 20 ml toluene is added drop wise. The reaction is refluxed and the water was collected in a Dean-Stark trap. After 16 hrs the reaction was cooled down, washed three times with water and once with diluted NaCI-solution. After drying over NaS04 the organic phase is concentrated and purified via column chromatography (hexane / EtOAc) yielding 18.6 g (86.2%) of 2-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)malonic acid diethyl ester.<br>
Example 2<br>
2-[[4-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)aminocarbonyl)oxy) benzylidene)malonic acid diethyl ester Into a stirred solution of 5 g (19 mmol) 2-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-malonic acid diethyl ester prepared as described above in 70 ml of THF and a few drops of dibutyltindilaureate catalyst was added 5.6 ml (22 mmol) 3-isocyanatopropyl-triethoxysilane (ICTEOS) under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 40°C until no free 2-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)malonic acid diethyl ester could be detected by TLC. After evaporation of THF the crude product was purified via column chromatography (Hexane / EtOAc) yielding 8.7 g (90%) of 2-[[4-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)aminocarbonyl)oxy) benzylidene)-malonic acid diethyl ester as colorless oil. UV (Ethanol), 290 nm (21068).<br>
Preparation of silica-coated titanium dioxide<br>
The coating of the metal oxide with the crosslinkable chromophore with UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C and/or broadband filter activity and optionally at least one type of crosslinkable monomer which does not have UV-A and/or UV-B and/or UV-C and/or broadband filter activity was verified by FT-IR spectrometry using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One, FT-IR Spectrometer by analysis of the resulting transmission infrared absorption spectrum: a peak originating from the Si-O-Si stretching vibration was observed from 1000 to 1200 cm"1. The incorporation of the crosslinkable chromophore is proven by a peak originating from the carbonyl group of the chromophore at 1650-1720 cm"1. If octyl trimethoxysilane is used as crosslinkable monomer without UV filter activity an additional -CH2/ -CH3 stretching vibration is observed from 2800-3000 cm"1.<br>
The effectiveness of the coating is proven via the method described below showing a reduced coloration of all samples prepared according to the invention compared to uncoated titanium dioxide.<br>
Stability during irradiation<br>
Untreated titanium dioxide produces an intense yellow coloration upon irradiation with UV-light. The more intense the color, the greater the reactivity of the titanium dioxide. This offers a good analytical test for the effectiveness of the surface treatment..<br>
A 10% dispersion of the coated Ti02 in Finsolv is drawn as a film on a glass plate with a 20 |j,m spreading knife. Afterwards irradiation was performed with a Hereaus Suntest with 40 MED. The judgement of the color of the samples was performed by comparison with ,,Methuen Handbook of Color", A. Kornerup und J.H. Wanscher, 3. edition, Eyre Methuen, London, 1984. Additionally, the samples were compared with untreated TiO2 and with a commercially available silicone coated titanium dioxide grade: Uvinul® TiO2 (octylsilylated titanium dioxide from BASF).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
*according toTable 3 "Methuen Handbook of Color", A. Kornerup und J.H. Wanscher, 3. edition<br>
All samples showed a reduced coloration compared to the untreated Ti02 and an equal or better performance compared to the commercial sample, Uvinul® TiO2 (octylsilylated titanium).<br>
Example 3<br>
To 9g of pyrogenic titanium dioxide (P25, Degussa) 1g of a mixture of octyltrimethoxysilane and 2-[[4-[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)aminocarbonyl)oxy) benzylidene)malonic acid diethyl ester from example 2 in a ratio of 5:1 (w/w) is added. The powder is then mixed well and heated to 100°C. During this time ethanol and methanol are removed. When 97% of the theoretical amount (weight) of the alcohols are distilled off the reaction is cooled and the white solid is washed three times in consecutive order with N,N-dimethylformamide, methanol, dichloromethane and diethyl -ether to remove unreacted silylation reagents.
