				<td>This invention "WIRELESS RESUME e-mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE' is a process, wherein an user can e-mail his Resume or Bio-data as an attachment to any Company, where he or she is seeking an employment, from a basic handset using the Short Message Service, popularly known as SMS. This is achieved without any need for the General Pocket Radio Service (GPRS) or a Wireless Access Protocol (WAP). Further, this Invention will be highly advantageous to the user in terms of money and time, as the purpose is served through a basic handset using SMS.<br>
Normally, the Conventional method followed by an user is to e- mail his or her resume/bio-data to any of the Company where he or she is seeking employment, will login to his or her e-mail account and attach his or her resume manually. Subsequently, he/she has to enter the "to address", "subject line" and manually click on the send button to e-mail his/her resume/bio-data. This process shall take at least 10 minutes in the normal course of time. Moreover, majority of the internet users who search for jobs e-mail their resumes accessing net through cyber cafes. This process consumes both time and money.<br>
Majority of these users own Mobile Phones, which is the basic requirement for this Invention.<br>
At present wireless e-mail is accessible only using General Pocket Radio Service (GRPS) or Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) enabled mobile phones. Moreover, in this wireless service, user cannot send a new attachment, such as his Resume or Bio-Data as an e-mail. All he or she can do is send a text e-mail of limited size or at the maximum can only forward an attachment which is already present in his e-mail inbox. Further, GPRS/WAP enabled handsets are costlier than basic handsets which support SMS. The monthly running charges for these services are beyond the reach of the common man and that is the reason that Short Message Service or SMS is availed most commonly. All these drawbacks are over come in this ^WIRELESS RESUME e-Mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE', with a mission to provide convenience to the user, not only in terms of money, but also their valuable time.<br>
This newly invented process of WIRELESS RESUME e- mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE, involves <br>
the following two stages, which are however one time steps:<br>
a)	First the user who wishes to avail WIRELESS RESUME e- mailing   SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE,<br>
requires to register himself with the service provider, giving his personal details, his mobile phone number and e-mail ID.<br>
b)	At the second stage, he has to upload his Resume/Bio-data in to the Web Sever of the Service Provider and subsequently is required to update his Resume periodically, as and when there are changes or modifications to be made in his/her resume.<br>
Once the user complies with the above two requisites, he or she can e-mail his Resume/Bio-data as an attachment to any Company from his basic handset using Short Message Service (SMS) from anytime from any place. There is no necessity for the user to login into his/her e-mail account at all. Further, for the user to adopt this service, has to do the following:<br>
The User has to just send a SMS to the number of the Service<br>
Provider, specifying the e-mail ID of the Company and the subject line of the e-mail in the following format, which is explained herein in detail with an example. If the user wants to e-mail his Resume as an attachment to <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b6d5d7c4d3d3c4c5f6d7d4d598d5d9db">[email&#160;protected]</a> with subject line as fresher 123, then the user message will be like this:<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="96f5f7e4f3f3e4e5d6f7f4f5b8f5f9fb">[email&#160;protected]</a>  Fresher 123<br>
Subsequently, the Service Provider shall e-mail the user resume/bio-data to the specified Company e-mail ID as sent through User e-mail ID provided at the time of Registration. Reply from the Company shall come directly to user e-mail ID. Further, a copy of the e-mailed resume will be sent to user e-mail ID as a confirmation along with a delivery report to the mobile phone of the user. The net result of this complete process WIRELESS RESUME e-mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE is that it just works as if the user has sent the e-mail from his/her own e-mail account directly, without reflecting the truth that the user has availed the services of a service-provider. Moreover, this process is not only foolproof but also 100% secure and reliable. <br>
To put it in a nutshell, this Invention WIRELESS RESUME<br>
e-mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE,<br>
provides the following advantages, over the conventional methods:<br>
1.	User of this service can e-mail his/her resume instantaneously from his basic mobile phone through SMS.<br>
2.	No need to access internet, which is time consuming, at times.<br>
3.	No need for the user to sign into e-mail account<br>
4.	Time is saved and expenses to this account are minimised<br>
'WIRELESS RESUME e-mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE' is an outstanding Invention in this technological world, wherein, a user can e-mail his/her resume as an attachment which will be in the size of the range 100 kilo bytes, from a basic handset through Short Message Services (SMS), which is not even supported on General Pocket Radio Service (GPRS) or the Wireless Access Protocol (WAP).<br>
Presently, this process is developed for only e-mailing the Resumes/Bio-data, which may be extended to e-mail Invoices/Quotations and so on, in the future, following the essence of the Invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I Claim,<br>
1) A process of WIRELESS RESUME e-mailing SERVICE THROUGH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE, wherein the user of this facility registers with the service provider, giving his personal details, Mobile Phone Number and e-mail ID and later uploads his Resume to the Web Server of the Service Provider, updating the same periodically; the user can e-mail his Resume as an attachment to any Company where he or she is seeking employment, from his basic handset using Short Message Service (SMS), without any need of General Pocket Radio Service (GPRS) or Wireless Access Protocol (WAP), from anywhere at any point of time without the necessity to login into his or her e-mail account by just sending a SMS to the Service Provider, specifying the e-mail ID of the Company and the subject line of the e-mail and the service provider will e-mail the User's Resume as registered and updated in the user's folio to that particular company as if the user has sent the e-mail from his own e-mail account <br>
and a delivery report to the Mobile Phone of the User is sent by the service provider as a confirmation.<br></td>
