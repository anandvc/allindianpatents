Both pigments and dyes are included in the general term "coloring materials", which denotes all materials used for their coloring properties.<br>
Literature survey revels that inorganic pigments are part of "coloring materials" which in composition with the organic additives adapted for the several functions,<br>
United States Patent No 3,840,383 teach about inorganic pigments in which the tendency to agglomeration is very much reduced or complete!} eliminated. This Patent further teaches flocculation-stable inorganic colored pigments which exhibit good resistance to corrosion and which-contain surface-active substances.<br><br>
United States Patent No. 5,931,996 concerns colored aluminum pigments comprising flake-form aluminum -substrates which are coated with a metal oxide layer and a process for the production thereof and use thereof;<br>
'U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,042 and EP-A-0 033 457 describe the production of gold-coloured aluminium pigments by the deposition of iron oxide, wherein iron pentacarbonyl is oxidised with oxygen in a fluidised bed of the aluminium flakes, the bed being produced by fluidisation with inert gas. The disadvantage of that procedure is the very high level of technological expenditure.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,475 describes the production of aluminium pigments which are coloured by fixing colour pigments on the metal surface. The colour pigments are fixed by way of carboxyl group-bearing polymers. A protective layer can be applied by polymerisation, to improve the adhesion. However the pigments produced in that way have only a low level of colour intensity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The word Pigment is of Latin origin (pigmentum) and  originally denoted a color in the sense of a coloring matter, The word pigment means a substance consisting of small particles that is practically insoluble in the applied medium and used on account of its coloring protective, or magnetic properties. Both pigments and dyes are included in the general term "coloring materials", which denotes all materials used for their colorkig properties.<br><br><br>
The characteristic that distinguishes pigments from soluble organic dyes is their low solubility in solvents and binders. Pigments can be characterized by their chemical composition, and by their optical or technical properties. Extenders/ fillers are substances in powder form that are practically insoluble in the medium in which they are applied. They are usually white or slightly colored, and are used on account of their physical or chemical properties. The distinction between an extender and a pigment lies in the purpose for which it is used. An extender is not a colorant, it is employed to modify the properties or increase the bulk volume of given material.<br>
Natural inorganic pigments have been known since prehistoric times. The caves paintings were made for charcoal, manganese; brown, and clays, oches is burned with manganese to produce red, violet, black pigments for pottery. Arsenic sulfide and Naples yellow were mixed the first yellow color pigments, Ultramarine and lapis lazuli, synthetically prepared copper hydrochloride were first green pigments, colored glazes for bricks were widely used, Calcite, some phases of calcium sulfate and kaoline are the white pigments. Paintings, enamel, glass, and dyeing techniques reached an advance state of the development in Middle East. A synthetic lapis lazuli (a silicate of copper and calcium) still known as Egyptian blue. Antimony sulfide and galena (PbS) are used as black pigments, Cinnabar as a red pigment, and ground cobalt glass and cobalt aluminium oxide as blue pigments.<br>
In the present days pigments increasingly became the subject of scientific investigation. The synthetic coloured pigments cadmium red, manganese blue, molybdenum red, mixed oxides with bismuth used as colorants. Titanium dioxide with anatase or rutile structure and acicular zinc oxide are introduced as new white pigments, and extenders.<br>
Inorganic pigments are classified based upon coloristic and chemical consideration<br>
"White pigments" the optical effect is caused by nonselective light scattering (Titanium dioxide and Zinc sulfide pigments, lithopone, and zinc white) "Colored pigments"-the optical effects is caused by selective light absorption   -and also to a large extend selective light scattering like iron oxide red, yellow, cadmium pigment, ultramarine pigment, chrome yellow, cobalt blue.<br>
4<br><br>
'Black pigments' the optical effect is caused by nonselective light absorption<br>
carbon black, iron oxide black,<br>
"Effect pigments" the optical effect is caused by regular reflection or<br>
interference.<br>
"Metal effect pigments" regular reflection takes place on mainly flat and parallel<br>
metallic pigment particle like aluminium flakes.<br>
"Pearl luster pigments" regular reflection takes place on highly refractive<br>
parallel platelets like titanium dioxide on mica.<br>
"Interference pigments" the optical effect of colored luster is caused wholly or<br>
mainly by the phenomenon of interference like Iron oxide on Mica.<br>
"Luminescent pigment" the optical effect is caused by the capacity to absorb<br>
radiation and to emit it as light of a higher wavelength.<br>
^Fluorescent pigments" the light of longer wavelength is emitted after excitation<br>
without a delay silver doped zinc sulfide.<br>
"Phosphorescent pigments" the light of longer wavelength is emitted within<br>
several hours after excitation like copper doped zinc sulfide.<br>

In preferred embodiment pigment material obtained form the nature is milled to a fine powder and then thoroughly mixed in the appropriate proportions. Milling fineness is not critical, but average particle size diameters from approximately 0.2 Âµm to about 5 Âµm are preferred.<br>
However, when a smaller average particle size is desired or when a particular application requires a strict avoidance of minor particle agglomerations, additional milling or grinding of the solid solutions can be performed.<br>
It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the method of the. present invention can be. practiced to manufacture a wide variety of solid solutions having utility as inorganic pigments for use in ceramics, polymers, paints, and other materials.<br>
In preferred embodiment solid solution milled pigments are treated with the natural cleannings agents more particularly, citrus fruits juices. Citrus fruits juices like lemon, sweet lemon or other fruits having high cocentreations of the citrus acid in it.Lemon juice with appropriate concentartion in water , which acts as the natural cleaning agent. This helps in removing unwanted impurity associated with the raw natural pigment materials. The process of cleaning and washing it with the deminerlised water is repeated number of time till appropriate gloss is achived. Washed pigmenetd material is allow to stand in the big vessal undistrubed till it settle down. The supsernant liquid is drain away.<br><br><br>
In preferred embodiment the water in juice is cocentration is up to 1-5% w/w prefrabley used.<br>
After, draining the supernanat water the the remaining water is dried naturally. In preferred embodiment adhesive form of water solutions in the manufacture of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. When the water evaporates, a film having a considerable adhesive character is formed. Some plant gums, such as gum arabic, dissolve in water to give clear solutions. Other gums, such as gum tragacanth, form mucilages by the absorption of large amounts of water.<br>
In preferred embodiment Several acacia species are important economically. A. Senegal, yields true gum arabic, a substance used in adhesives, pharmaceuticals, inks, confections, and other products. The bark of most acacias is rich in tannin, which is used in tanning and in dyes, inks, pharmaceuticals, and other products. The babul tree {A. arabica), of tropical Africa and across Asia, yields both an inferior type of gum arabic and a tannin. Acacias are valuable sources of tannin, among them the golden wattle (A. pyenantha), the green wattle (A. decurrens), and the silver wattle {A. dealbata).<br>
A few acacias produce valuable timber, among them the Australian Blackwood {A. melanoxylon); the yarran (A. homalophylla),; and A. koa. Sweet acacia {A. famesiana) is native to the southwestern.<br>
Gum particles, is extracted by hot water and subsequently frozen for purification. Algin is obtained by digesting seaweed in alkali and precipitating either the calcium salt or alginic acid. Gum arabic is harvested from acacia trees that are artificially wounded to cause the gum to exude.<br>
Adhesive substance of vegetable origin, mostly obtained as exudate from, the bark of trees or shrubs belonging to the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae) of the pea order Fabaies. Some plant gums are used in the form of water solutions in the manufacture of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. When the water evaporates, a film having a considerable adhesive character is formed. Some plant gums, such as gum arabic, dissolve in water to give clear solutions. Other<br>
7<br><br>
gums, such as gum tragaeanth. form mucilages by the absorption of large amounts of water.<br>
Gum is produced by making an incision in the bark of the tree and co.tlecting the exudate repeatedly throughout the season. Gums so obtained consist of small lumps, usually transparent and light yellow. Trees produce gums by a process called gummosis. possibly as a protective mechanism, either after mechanical damage to the bark or after a bacterial, insect, or fungal attack upon it. The Acacia Senegal tree yields the greatest amount of gum acacia when it is in an unhealthy condition, and good culture methods reduce the yield.<br>
Gum arabic is the most widely used of the water-soluble gums. True gum arabic is gum acacia; that is, it is produced by species of Acacia. The name gum arabic is sometimes also applied to substitutes for gum acacia, including gum gatti.<br>
In a preferred embodiment acacia gum is collected and is dissolved in deminaralised water up to the 5-10% w/w ratio of the gum to the weight of the water as diluents is taken preferably.<br>
The diluted gum solution is mixed with the dry and clean soiid pigmented material to form the paste of the same. This paste is allowed to evaporate to dryness and further crushed to the fine power. This solid solution of inorganic pigment with the natural adhesive has characteristic for the adhesion. Thus the paste formed use as the natural colorant for the desired purpose.<br>
The above prepared solid pigmented solution can be stored in the suitable form like pellets, cubes, and tablets or filled in bottles, pouches for easy handling.<br>
A method for manufacturing solid pigment solution involves milling the inorganic pigment to the One powder up to the 2-5Âµ mesh size. The finely meshed inorganic pigments are cleaned with the 5.0% lime juice solution in deminaralised water. The solid remains allow drying and mixed with the 10.0% w/w Arabic gum in hot water. The paste formed in naturallv dried. The dried material is crushed to fine powder and stored in suitable manner.<br><br><br>
The solid pigment solution form thus have characteristic like that it is Eco-fricndly as it uses  least chemicals, durable can remain unaltered for centuries.<br>
EXAMPLE-;<br>
1. Preparing white pigment solution;<br>
1.0 kg naturally occuring Zinc White powder is milled to obain the fine podwer of the mesh size of 2-5Âµ size. This finely milled powder is treated with the lime   * juice in water approximatly concentration  is up to 1% w/w . The mixture allow to settle down. The supernana! water is draiend. The sloid treated white pigment material is washed with the dimenrlasied water till it free form the lime juice.<br>
.    10.0 gms of the Gum arabic is dissolved in water , which is then mixed with the washed and dried white pigment material. The paste is dried naturally and stored in the suitable form.<br>
