pharmaceutically acceptable acids, but the salts of<br>
other acids that are useful, for example, for the<br>
purification or isolation of the compounds of formula<br>
(I) also form part of the invention.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) may be<br>

carbon-based chain possibly containing from t to z<br>
carbon atoms, for example a C1-3 carbon-based chain<br>
which may contain from 1 to 3 carbon atoms,<br>
- alkyl, a saturated, linear or branched aliphatic<br>
group, for example a C1-3-alkyl group represents a<br>
linear or branched carbon-based chain of 1 to<br>
3 carbon atoms, more particularly a methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl or 1-methylethyl,<br>
- alkylene, a saturated, linear or branched divalent<br>
alkyl group, for example a C1-3-alkylene group<br>
represents a linear or branched divalent carbon-based<br>
chain of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, more particularly a<br>
methylene, ethylene, 1-methylethylene or propylene,<br>

cycloalkyl group represents a cyclic carbon-based<br>
group of 3 to 5 carbon atoms, more particularly a<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl or cyclopentyl,<br>
- alkoxy, an -O-alkyl group containing a saturated,<br>
linear or branched aliphatic chain,<br>
- thioalkyl, an -S-alkyl group containing a saturated,<br>
linear or branched aliphatic chain,<br>
- fluoroalkyl, an alkyl group in which one or more<br>
hydrogen atoms have been replaced with a fluorine<br>
atom,<br>
- fluoroalkoxy, an alkoxy group in which one or more<br>
hydrogen atoms have been replaced with a fluorine<br>
atom,<br>
- fluorothioalkyl, a thioalkyl group in which one or<br>
more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with a<br>
fluorine atom,<br>
- halogen atom, a fluorine, a chlorine, a bromine or an<br>
iodine.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be<br>
prepared according to various methods, illustrated by<br>
the schemes that follow.<br>
Thus, a first method (Scheme 1) consists in<br>
reacting an amine of general formula (II), in which A,<br>
B, R1, n and m are as defined above, with a carbonate of<br>
general formula (IIIa) in which Z represents a hydrogen<br>
atom or a nitro group, R4 is as defined above and R<br>
represents a methyl or ethyl group. The carbamate ester<br>
of general formula (la) thus obtained is then converted<br>
into a compound of general formula (I), via aminolysis<br>
using an amine of general formula R5NH2 in which R5 is<br>
as defined above. The aminolysis reaction may be<br>
performed in a solvent such as methanol or a mixture of<br>
solvents such as methanol and tetrahydrofuran or<br>
methanol and dioxane.<br>
One variant for obtaining the compounds of<br>
general formula (I) (Scheme 1) consists in reacting an<br>
amine of general formula (II), as defined above, with a<br>
carbonate of general formula (IIIb), in which Z<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or a nitro group and R4 and<br>
R5 are as defined above, in a solvent such as toluene or<br>
dichloroethane, at a temperature of between 0°C and<br>
80°C.<br>
The carbonates of general formula (IIIa) and<br>
(IIIb) may be prepared according to any method<br>
described in the literature, for example by reacting an<br>
alcohol of general formula HOCHR4COOR, in which R<br>
represents a methyl or ethyl group, or HOCHR4CONHR5 in<br>
which R4 and R5 are as defined above, with phenyl<br>
chloroformate or 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, in the<br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine or diiso-<br>
propylethylamine.<br>
A second method for obtaining the compounds<br>
of general formula (I) (Scheme 2) consists in reacting<br>
a derivative of general formula (IIa) in which Y<br>
represents a hydroxyl, mesylate or tosylate group or a<br>
chlorine, bromine or iodine atom and A, B, R1, n and m<br>
are as defined above, with an oxazolidinedione of<br>
general formula (IV) in which R4 is as defined above, to<br>
give the oxazolidinedione derivative of general formula<br>
(V). In the case where Y represents a hydroxyl group,<br>
the reaction may be performed according to the<br>
Mitsunobu conditions (Synthesis, 1981, 1-28), for<br>
example via the action of diethyl or diisopropyl<br>
azodicarboxylate in the presence of triphenylphosphine.<br>
In the case where Y represents a chlorine, bromine or<br>
iodine atom or a mesylate or tosylate group, the<br>
reaction may be performed in the presence of a base<br>
such as 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine, sodium hydride or<br>
sodium tert-butoxide in a solvent such as tetrahydro-<br>
furan, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, at a<br>
temperature of between 0°C and the reflux temperature<br>
of the solvent. The oxazolidinedione derivative of<br>
general formula (V) thus obtained is then converted<br>
into a compound of general formula (I), via aminolysis<br>
using an amine of general formula R5NH2 in which R5 is<br>
as defined above.<br><br>
The compounds of general formulae (I), (Ia),<br>
(II), (IIa) and (V), in which R1 is substituted with a<br>
group R", may also be prepared by reacting the<br>
corresponding compounds of general formulae (I), (Ia),<br>
(II), (IIa) and (V), for which R1 is substituted with a<br>
chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or with a triflate<br>
group in the position into which the group R" is to be<br>
introduced, with an aryl- or heteroaryl-boronic acid<br>
derivative according to the Suzuki reaction conditions<br>
(Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483) or with an aryl- or<br>
heteroaryl-trialkylstannane derivative according to the<br>
Stille reaction conditions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1986,<br>
25, 504-524).<br>
The compounds of general formulae (II), (IIa)<br>
and (IV), when their preparation method is not<br>
described, are commercially available or are described<br>
in the literature, or alternatively may be prepared<br>
according to methods that are described therein or<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The amines of general formula R5NH2 are<br>
commercially available.<br>
According to another of its aspects, a<br>
subject of the invention is also the compounds of<br>
formula (Ia) in which n, m, A, B, R1 and R4 are as<br>
defined above and R represents a methyl or ethyl group.<br>
The compounds of formula (Ia) are useful as synthetic<br>
intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of<br>
formula (I).<br>
According to another of its aspects, a<br>
subject of the invention is also the compounds of<br>
formula (V) in which n, m, A, B, R1 and R4 are as<br>
defined above, the following compounds being excluded:<br>

piperidyl]-2,4-oxazolidinedione<br>

the reaction medium. The aqueous phase is separated out<br>
and extracted three times with dichloromethane, and the<br>
combined organic phases are washed with saturated<br>
aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced<br>
pressure and the residue thus obtained is then purified<br>
by chromatography on silica gel, eluting with a 10/90<br>
mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane. 4.65 g of<br>
product are thus obtained in the form of an orange-<br>
coloured oil. 0.60 ml of a solution of osmium tetroxide<br>
(2.5%) in tert-butanol is added at room temperature to<br>
a solution of 4.50 g of this oily residue and 1.25 g<br>
(10.7 mmol) of N-methylmorpholine oxide (NMO) in a<br>
mixture of 8 ml of acetone and 6 ml of water. Stirring<br>
is continued for 21 hours. The residue is taken up in<br>
ethyl acetate and water, the aqueous phase is separated<br>
out and extracted twice with ethyl acetate, and the<br>
combined organic phases are washed with saturated<br>
aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. After evaporating off the solvent, the residue<br>
obtained is purified by chromatography on silica gel,<br>
eluting with a 6/94 mixture of ethyl acetate and<br>
cyclohexane.<br>

ammonia. The phases are separated by settling, the<br>
aqueous phase is extracted twice with dichloromethane<br>
and the combined organic phases are washed with<br>
saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over<br>
sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
2.30 g of product are obtained in the form of<br>

The compounds of the invention underwent<br>
pharmacological trials to determine their inhibitory<br>
effect on the enzyme FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase).<br>
The inhibitory,activity was demonstrated in a<br>
radioenzymatic test based on measuring the product of<br>
hydrolysis (ethanolamine [1-3H]) of anandamide [ethanol-<br>
amine 1-3H] with FAAH {Life Sciences (1995), 56, 1999-<br>
2005 and Journal of Pharmacology and Experimented<br>
Therapeutics (1997), 283, 729-734). Thus, mouse brains<br>
(minus the cerebellum) are removed and stored at -80°C.<br>
Membrane homogenates are prepared extemporaneously by<br>
homogenizing the tissues using a Polytron blender in<br>
10 mM tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl<br>
and 1 mM EDTA. The enzymatic reaction is then performed<br>
 in 70 µl of buffer containing fatty-acid-free bovine<br>
serum albumin (1 mg/ml). To test compounds at different<br>
concentrations, anandamide [ethanolamine 1-3H] (specific<br>
activity of 15-20 Ci/mmol) diluted to 10 uM with cold<br>
anandamide, and the membrane preparation (400 ug of<br>
 frozen tissue per test) are successively added. After<br>
15 minutes at 25°C, the enzymatic reaction is quenched<br>
by adding 140 uL of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The<br>
mixture is stirred for 10 minutes and then centrifuged<br>
for 15 minutes at 3500 g. An aliquot (30 uL) of the<br>
 aqueous phase containing the ethanolamine [1-3H] is<br>
counted by liquid scintillation. Under these<br>
conditions, the most active compounds of the invention<br>
have IC50 values (concentration that inhibits 50% of the<br>
control enzymatic activity of FAAH) of between 0.001<br>
 and 1 µM.<br>
Table 2 below shows the IC50 values of a few<br>
compounds according to the invention.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
It is thus seen that the compounds according<br>
to the invention have inhibitory activity on the enzyme<br>
FAAH.<br>
The in vivo activity of the compounds of the<br>
invention was evaluated in a test of analgesia.<br>
Thus, the intraperitoneal (i.p.)<br>
administration of PBQ (phenylbenzoquinone, 2 mg/kg in<br>
0.9% sodium chloride solution containing 5% ethanol) to<br>
male OF1 mice weighing 25 to 30 g, causes abdominal<br>
tractions, on average 30 torsions or contractions<br>
during the period of 5 to 15 minutes after injection.<br>
The test compounds are administered orally or intra-<br>
peritoneally as a 0.5% suspension in Tween 80, 60<br>
minutes or 120 minutes before the administration of<br>
PBQ. Under these conditions, the most powerful<br>
compounds of the invention produce a 35% to 70%<br>
reduction in the number of tractions induced with PBQ,<br>
within a dose range of between 1 and 30 mg/kg.<br>
Table 3 below shows the results of the<br>
analgesia test for a few compounds according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The enzyme FAAH (Chemistry and Physics of<br>
Lipids, (2000), 108, 107-121) catalyses the hydrolysis<br>
of the endogenous amide and ester derivatives of<br>
various fatty acids such as N-arachidonoylethanolamine<br>
(anandamide), N-palmitoylethanolamine, N-oleoylethanol-<br>
amine, oleamide or 2-arachidonoylglycerol. These<br>
derivatives exert different pharmacological activities<br>
by interacting, inter alia, with the cannabinoid and<br>
vanilloid receptors.<br>
The compounds of the invention block this<br>
degradation pathway and increase the tissue content of<br>
these endogenous substances. They may be used in this<br>
respect in the prevention and treatment of pathologies<br>
in which the endogenous cannabinoids, and/or any other<br>
substrates metabolized by the enzyme FAAH, are<br>
involved. Examples that may be mentioned include the<br>
following diseases and complaints:<br>
pain, especially acute or chronic pain of neurogenic<br>
type: migraine, neuropathic pain including the forms<br>
associated with the herpes virus and diabetes, acute or<br>
chronic pain associated with inflammatory diseases:<br>
arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,<br>
spondylitis, gout, vascularitis, Crohn's disease,<br>
irritable bowel syndrome,<br>
acute or chronic peripheral pain,<br>
vertigo, vomiting, nausea, in particular post-<br>
chemotherapy nausea,<br>
eating disorders, in particular anorexia and cachexia<br>
of diverse nature,<br>
neurological and psychiatric pathologies: tremor,<br>
dyskinaesia, dystonia, spasticity, compulsive and<br>
obsessive behaviour, Tourette's syndrome, all forms of<br>
depression and anxiety of any nature or origin, mood<br>
disorders, psychoses,<br>
acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases:<br>
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, senile<br>
dementia, Huntington's chorea, lesions associated with<br>
cerebral ischaemia and cranial and medullary trauma,<br>
epilepsy,<br>
sleeping disorders, including sleep apnoea,<br>
cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension,<br>
cardiac arrhythmia, arteriosclerosis, heart attack,<br>
cardiac ischaemia,<br>
renal ischaemia,<br>
chronic obstruction of the respiratory pathways,<br>
emphysema,<br>
gastrointestinal diseases: irritable bowel syndrome,<br>
intestinal inflammatory disorders, ulcers, diarrhoea,<br>
urinary incontinence and inflammation of the bladder.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the<br>
invention, in the form of the base, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salt, hydrate<br>
or solvate, for the preparation of a medicinal product<br>
for treating the pathologies mentioned above forms an<br>
integral part of the invention.<br>
A subject of the invention is also medicinal<br>
products comprising a compound of formula (I), or an<br>
acid-addition salt, or alternatively a pharmaceuticaily<br>
acceptable hydrate or solvate of the compound of<br>
formula (I). These medicinal products find their<br>
therapeutic use especially in the treatment of the<br>
pathologies mentioned above.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the<br>
