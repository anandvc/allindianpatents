				<td>INKJET RECORDING APPARATUS AND INK CARTRIDGE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an inkjet recording apparatus fitted with a recording head for ejecting droplets of ink onto a recording medium in response to a print signal and also to an ink cartridge used in this ink  et recording apparatus  2. Description of the Related Art<br>
An inkjet recording apparatus has a recording head for<br>
ejecting droplets of ink. This head is mounted on a carriage<br>
that reciprocates relative to a recording medium. The recording<br>
apparatus currently available is so designed that ink is supplied<br>
to the recording head from an ink cartridge via an ink channel<br>
such as a tube or that ink is supplied to the recording head<br>
via an ink supply needle formed on the carriage where an ink<br>
cartridge is mounted.	<br>
Either of these types employs an arrangement in which an ink leading-out member, such as the ink supply needle, of the main body side is inserted into or connected to an ink supply port of the ink cartridge, and therefore the ink cartridge and the ink leading-out member must be reliably connected and fixed to each other so as to avoid an unintentional disconnection therebetween. To this end, it is necessary to provide a member<br>
 <br>
for fixing the ink cartridge to the cartridge accommodation portion in the related art.<br>
The arrangement using the aforementioned fixing member, however, requires two operations, i.e. mounting an ink supply port of the ink cartridge to a coupling member formed at an end of the ink supply path, and thereafter fixing the cartridge by the fixing member. Consequently, the sequence of operations for mounting is cumbersome to perform. Further, the fixing means is required to make the structure complicated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view.of these problems, the present invention has been made. It is an object of the present invention to provide an InkJet recording apparatus permitting an inkjet cartridge to be fixed .to .an 'ink cartridge accommodation portion- simply by. pushing-in the ink cartridge in the mounting direction.<br>
It is .another object of the invention to provide an  ink<br>
cartridge adapted for the recording apparatus described above.<br>
To solve these problems, an inkjet recording apparatus<br>
according to the present invention as claimed in claim 1 is so<br>
designed that ink is supplied to a recording head from an ink<br>
cartridge mounted in a cartridge accommodation region. The ink<br>
cartridge has a first member constituting .a one-push type fixing<br>
member that is formed on the ink cartridge. The inkjet recording<br>
apparatus has a second member that constitutes another one-push<br>
type fixing member cooperating with the first member and that<br>
 <br>
is formed in a position facing a plane substantially parallel to an insertion direction in which the ink cartridge is inserted into the cartridge accommodation region whereby the cartridge is held in a predetermined position in a state in which the ink cartridge is resiliently urged by resiliently urging member in a direction opposite to the insertion.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus according to the present invention as claimed in claim 3 is designed so that the resiliently urging means includes a spring that biases a valve body' loaded in an ink supply port.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus according to the present invention as claimed in claim 5 is designed so that a position of the holding portion or a diameter of the protrusion is selected to define a clearance between a dead point at pushing-in of the1 ink cartridge and the predetermined position<br>
 'An ink cartridge according to the present invention a s claimed<br>
in claim 6 has an ink storing portion storing ink therein'and<br>
an ink supply port communicating with the,ink storing portion,<br>
and is adapted to removably mounted on a cartridge mounting portion<br>
of a recording' apparatus to supply the ink in the ink storing<br>
portion via the ink supply port to a recording head provided<br>
on the recording apparatus. The ink cartridge includes: a first<br>
member that constitutes a one-push type fixing member that is<br>
formed on a plane substantially parallel to an insertion direction<br>
in which the ink cartridge is inserted into the cartridge mounting<br>
 <br>
portion, and that cooperates with a second member constituting another one-push type fixing member of the recording apparatus. The ink cartridge according to the present invention as claimed in claim 7 is designed so that the second member includes a protrusion, whose range of motion is restricted, and the first member includes a combination of a guide path for guiding the protrusion in one direction, and a holding portion engaging the protrusion.<br>
The ink cartridge according to the present invention as claimed in claim 10 is designed so that the resiliently urging • means includes a spring that biases a valve member loaded in the ink supply port.<br>
The ink cartridge- according to the present invention as 'claimed in claim 12 is designed so that the first member is disposed • on a wall surface intersecting a wall surface on' which the ink. supply port is disposed, and located at a position,of fset .toward the wall surface on which the ink supply port is disposed.<br>
. The ink: cartridge according to the present invention as. claimed in1 claim 13 is designed so that the ink supply port is located at a:position offset toward the wall surface on which the first member is disposed.<br>
The ink cartridge according to the present invention as claimed in claim 14 is designed so that the protrusion whose range of motion is restricted is Movable in a plane direction of the plane substantially parallel to the insertion direction,<br>
 <br>
and also movable in a direction intersecting the plane.<br>
The ink cartridge according to the present invention as claimed in claim 15 is designed so that the holding portion of the first member is resiliently held by the protrusion by an urging force of resiliently urging means<br>
The ink cartridge according to the present invention as claimed in claim 16 is designed so that a position of the holding portion or a diameter of the protrusion is selected to define a clearance between a dead point at pushing-in of the ink cartridge and the predetermined position.<br>
According to. the present invention as claimed in claim 1 (claim 6), when the cartridge is mounted the ink cartridge is pushed-in against the resiliently urging means, .so that the cartridge is held -in 'the predetermined' position .by the action of the one-push, type fixing members and' the biasing force of the resiliently urging means . When the ink cartridge is detached, the ink-cartridge' is pushed-in against the biasing force; This • disengages-the one-push type fixing members, and therefore the ink .cartridge is moved in the removing direction opposite, to the-insertion direction, by the biasing force.<br>
Therefore, when the cartridge is installed, the ink cartridge can be held into a predetermined position simply by pushing in .. the cartridge against resilient means. Furthermore, the ink cartridge can be disengaged by pushing it in against the biasing force, so.that the cartridge can be moved in the removing direction<br>
 <br>
by the biasing force. Moreover, fixing means such as a cover member for fixing the. cartridge to the cartridge accommodation region can be dispensed with, and further the ink cartridge can be easily taken out.<br>
According to the present invention as claimed in claim 3 (claim 10), a simplified structure can be realized because an additional member, i.e. a spring, for biasing the ink cartridge is unnecessary.<br>
According to the present invention as claimed in claim 5 (claim 16), owing to the clearance between the dead point and the holding position, the packing of the ink supply port can be reliably brought into close contact with the ink supply needle to improve the air tightness. Further ink can flow-in between the packing and the ink supply needle during the removal to reduce  the friction, so that the ink cartridge can be., surely taken out only by the stored force of the resiliently-urging means According to the present invention as claimed in claim 1; it is unnecessary to dispose, on the ink cartridge side,, a movable . member for fixing the ink cartridge to the carriage and further the arrangement can be realized simply by forming protruded and recessed portions on the wall surface. Therefore, the structure and the package can be simplified.<br>
According to the present invention as claimed, in any one of claims 12 to 15, the region as close to the ink supply port as possible can be used as a holding region of the ink cartridge,<br>
 <br>
and therefore it is possible to eliminate the displacement of the ink cartridge caused by an external force, and to reduce an adverse effect on the joint portion between the ink supply port and the ink supply needle.<br>

•DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT ' The present invention is hereinafter described in detail with reference to the illustrated embodiments. .<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of an inkjet recording apparatus of the present invention. A case is made up of a case body 1 and a cover 2. A carriage 4 is accommodated in the case to be<br>
 <br>
opposed to a platen 3 and to be reciprocatingly movable. Two kinds of ink, cartridges 5 and 6 having different widths are detachably mounted on the top surface of the carriage 4.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodinent of the carriage 4. In this<br>
embodiment, inkjet recording heads 7 and 8 that receive supply<br>
of inks from ink cartridges 5 and 6, respectively, are disposed<br>
on the bottom surface of the carriage 4. Vertical walls 11 form<br>
a boxlike enclosure on the upper surface of the carriage 4 to<br>
accommodate the ink cartridges 5 and 6 such that their top surfaces<br>
are exposed. In this way, a cartridge holder 9 is integrally<br>
formed	<br>
The cartridge holder 9 is partitioned by a rib. 10 into two sections to' accommodate the two kinds of ink cartridges 5 . and 6 in given regions. Windows l1c and l1d for -forming fixing . members are respectively formed at substantially central portions :of the vertical walls lla and l1b that, respectively define the regions for accommodating the cartridges.  Fixing protrusions' .12a.and 13a of fixing members 12 and 13 as described later protrude through the windows l1c and l1d into the side of the cartridge ••accommodation regions.<br>
The windows l1c and l1d are formed as arc-shaped through holes which limit the movement of the fixing, protrusions 12a and 13a- to a certain angular range L. Mounting holes l1e and llf are formed on the centerlines of the windows l1c and l1d and under these windows l1c and l1d.<br>
 <br>
These window l1c, l1d and fixing member 12, 13 together form a one-push type fixing member.<br>
Fig. 3A shows an embodiment of the fixing member 12, 13. In this embodiment, the fixing members 12 and 13 are shaped identically. The fixing members 12 (1.3) has an arm 12b (13b) . The fixing protrusion 12a (13a) that is longer than the thickness of the.vertical wall lla (l1b) but does not hinder insertion of the cartridge is formed at one end of the arm-12b (13b) perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the arm 12b (13b). A mounting portion 12c (13c) that is rotatably inserted into the mounting hole l1e (llf) is formed at the; other end in the same direction as the fixing protrusion 12a (13a) . A tapering portion 12d (13d) for preventing disconnection and a split groove 12e (13e)' are formed at the front end of the mounting portion 12c .(13c.).. The arm 12b (13b) is so designed that the position of the fixing protrusion 12a (13a) is displaceable in a-direction intersecting a surface direction of a fixing member 30 described later, in conformity with recessed and protruded .portions of the fixing member 30, and that the arm 12b (13b) has such an'elasticity as to cause the fixing protrusion 12a (13a) to contact the fixing ' member 30 with a given contact force.  This ensures reliable contact between, the fixing protrusion 12a- (13a) and the fixing member 30, to thereby eliminate failure of fixing the ink cartridge caused due to insufficient contact.<br>
Because of this structure, when the fixing protrusion 12a<br>
 <br>
(13a) of the fixing member 12 (13) is inserted into the window l1e (l1d) and the tapering portion 12d (13d) of the mounting portion 12c (13c) is forced into the mounting hole l1e (llf) , the mounting portion is permitted by the split groove 12e (13e) to be deformed and then rotatably fitted in the mounting hole l1e .(llf) <br>
• Figs. 4A and 4B show embodiments of the ink cartridges 5 and 6 of the invention. Namely, Fig. 4A show the ink cartridge which contains one kind of ink, black ink in this embodiment, and Fig. 4B shows the ink cartridge which is formed with a plurality of separate ink storage chambers by partition walls' or the like and which contains different kinds of inks, .yellow, magenta and cyan in this embodiment, in respective -ink storage chambers, each- having an independent ink supply port.<br>
Here, only one -ink cartridge 5 is described. A fixing member, .30 that-guides and engages the aforementioned- fixing, protrusion 12a is formed in one wall surface 21 parallel to the-direction of' insertion- of a . container 20 that contains-ink therein.<br>
Another wall surf ace 29 that is perpendicular to the direction of insertion is provided with an ink1 supply port 22 that engages an ink supply needle 14 of the carriage to discharge the/ ink inside the cartridge therefrom.<br>
In this ink cartridge, the fixing member 30 is disposed at a position offset toward the surface (the bottom surface) 29 where the ink supply port 22 is formed, i.e. at a lower portion<br>
 <br>
region in the insertion direction of the ink cartridge -in this embodiment, and further the ink supply port 22 is disposed at a position offset toward the wall surface (the side surface) 21 (i.e. at the right side in the figure). Consequently, the fixing member 30 can surely fix a portion -of the ink cartridge in the vicinity of the ink supply port 22.  This, arrangement can prevent the displacement of the ink cartridge even when- an external 'force is applied in a state in which the ink supply needle 14 is inserted into the ink supply port 22, to thereby reduce an adverse affect on the connection portion between the ink supply.'part 22 and the ink supply needle 1.4. That is, since the ink supply port 22 is located at the position offset toward the wall surface 20. where the fixing member is formed,, the fixing member 30 can receive the external force to reliably. provide' the above-noted-advantageous effect. <br>
,•.. As shown in .Fig-. 5, a packing 26 and a-valve body 23 are, loaded in the ink'supply port 22 in such a way that the valve body 23 is biased by a spring 24 which is a coiled spring. The packing 26 serves as a sealing member, which closely and sealingly contacts the circumference of the ink supply needle 14.  The valve body 23 contacts one end face of the packing 26 to close and seal an opening formed through the packing 26 when the cartridge is removed from the carriage, and opens the ink supply port by insertion of the ink supply needle 14 when the ink cartridge is mounted on the carriage. The extent of resilience of the spring<br>
 <br>
24 is such that even when the ink cartridge 5 is fully filled with ink and the ink supply port 22 engages the ink supply needle 14, the spring can bias the cartridge 5 in the direction opposite to the direction of insertion against the frictional force caused between the ink supply needle 14 and the packing 26.<br>
In the aforementioned embodiment, the spring 24,. provided in the ink supply port 17, for biasing the valve body 23 in the direction to close the valve body 23 is used to bias the ink cartridge in the direction opposite to the direction in which the cartridge 5 is inserted. In a case where the' repulsion force of -the spring 24 is small or the cartridge.does not have the valve, body 23 biased-by the spring 24, the same advantages can • . be obtained-by mounting a biasing spring 25 near the ink supply • port- 22 .and in. the front-end surface as- viewed in the direction of insertion of the ink cartridge (i.e., the surface in which the ink-supply, 22: .is formed) or in the surface-of .the carriage 4 that faces the ink 'supply port 22.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an embodiment of the fixing member 30 formed', on the ink cartridge, which constitutes the one-push type fixing member. A recess portion 31 having an entrance port of width-W capable of almost covering the range of-movement L of the fixing protrusion 12a is formed at the front end as viewed in the direction in which the cartridge is loaded (in this embodiment, in a lower portion) . A guide portion 32 having an upper portion on one side is formed in the center of the recess portion 31 as viewed in<br>
 <br>
the direction of insertion of the cartridge. A protruded portion . 32a is formed in the center of the guide portion 32 such that passages through which the protrusion 12a can pass are formed on both sides of the protruded portion 32a.<br>
In a lower portion side (the left side in the figure) relative<br>
to the protruded portion 32a, there are formed a vertical wall<br>
32b over which the protrusion 12a cannot pass during the movement<br>
•of the ink cartridge in the insertion direction, and an inclined<br>
surface 32c, above the vertical wall 32b, over which the protrusion<br>
12a can easily pass during the movement of the ink cartridge<br>
in the removal direction.	<br>
• - In 'the other side, i.e. an. upper portion side .(the right side in the figure) .relative to the protruded portion 32a, there are formed, an inclined surface 32d over which the protrusion1 I2a can easily pass during the movement, of the ink cartridge 'in ..the insertion direction, and a vertical wall .32e, .above the inclined surface 32d, over which the protrusion 12a'cannot pass during the movement of the ink cartridge in the removal direction. . This arrangement of the inclined surface 32d and the vertical wall 32e in the upper portion side is reverse to the arrangement of the vertical wall 32b and the inclined surface 32c in the lowerportion  side Theprotrusion 12a enters through the inclined surface 32d, and exits through the inclined surface 32c<br>
An angular vertical wall 33a, whose vertex 33 is located slightly offset from the centerline C of the recess portion 31<br>
 <br>
toward the inclined surface 32d, is formed in a deeper portion of the recess portion 31 relative to the entrance side of the protrusion 12a. A vertical wall 32g obliquely upwardly extends substantially from the centerline C of the protruded portion 32a toward the exist side (the left side in the figure) to provide a holding portion 34 made up of a V-shaped recess portion for engagement with the protrusion. 12a.<br>
This holding portion 34 is disposed at a center in the width direction of the cartridge/ or on a plane which passes through a central axis of the ink supply port and which is perpendicular to the wall surface, so that-the holding portion 34 in cooperation with the protrusion 12a can reliably fix-the ink cartridge- 5 at a predetermined position, while causing no moment on the ink supply needle 14. <br>
Indicated by numeral 35 in the figure .is .a. movement, direction-restricting member disposed closer .to the. inclined-surface 32c than to the holding portion 34. This restricting member-35 has-an. inclined surface 35a over which the protrusion 12a can easily pass and a vertical wall 35b over which the protrusion 12a cannot 'easily pass.<br>
In this embodiment, when the ink cartridge 5 is inserted, the fixing protrusion 12a enters the opening of the recess portion 31 of the fixing member 30 and reaches the inclined surface 32d while being guided by the guide portion 32 (the vertical wall 32b) in one direction (Fig. 71) . Then, the fixing protrusion<br>
 <br>
12a passes over this inclined surface 32d (Fig. 711) .<br>
Under this condition, when the cartridge 5 is further pushed-in against the elastic force of the spring 24 of the ink supply port, the ink cartridge 5 reaches a dead point at which the fixing protrusion 12a contacts the angular wall 33a located in the deeper portion of the recess portion 31 (Fig. 81} . Under this condition, if the hand is released from the ink cartridge<br>
5, the ink cartridge 5 is moved by a slight distance AG in the<br>
direction opposite to the direction of insertion by the reaction force of the spring 24 so that the fixing protrusion 12a is fitted into the holding portion 34, while being guided toward the centerline C by the vertical wall 32e (Fig. 811) .<br>
There is a slight clearance between the dead point at the pushing-in of the ink cartridge 5 into the cartridge holder and a cartridge holding position.  For this reason, when the 'ink cartridge is moved from the dead point at the pushing-in to the cartridge holding position, the packing 26 is moved in the contracting direction due to the friction to the ink supply needle 14, so that the packing 26 reliably contacts the circumference of the ink supply needle 14 elastically, to thereby ensure air-tightness.<br>
In addition, such clearance canbe determined by the diameter of the fixing protrusion 12a, the position of the holding portion 34, or the like.<br>
On the other hand, in a case where the ink in the ink cartridge<br>
 <br>
has been consumed and the ink cartridge 5 is replaced, the cartridge<br>
5 is pushed-in against the reaction force of the spring 24. The<br>
fixing protrusion 12a passes over the inclined surface 35a of<br>
the movement-restricting member 35, while being guided by the<br>
angular wall 33a located in the deeper portion of the recess<br>
portion 31(Fig. 91). The amount of the movement during this<br>
pushing-in corresponds to the aforementioned slight clearance<br>
between the- dead point at the pushing-in and the cartridge holding<br>
position. By this movement, the packing 26 is relatively moved<br>
with respect to the ink supply needle 14 so that ink flows in<br>
there between The ink serves as lubricant to reduce the friction<br>
during the removal.	<br>
Under this condition, if the hand is released from the cartridge 5, the reaction force of the spring 24 elevates- .the cartridge 5. During this process, the-fixing protrusion 12a passes over, the inclined surface 32c to be free from the restriction (Fig. 911).<br>
When a new cartridge 5 is loaded into a given position and then pushed-in, the ink cartridge can be . fixed into; a predetermined position in the same way as the foregoing.<br>
In the embodiment described above, a recording apparatus of the type where the cartridge holder is mounted to the carriage •has been described. It is apparent that similar- advantages can be produced when the invention is applied to a type of the recording apparatus in which the cartridge is installed on the case body<br>
 <br>
1 forming the recording apparatus and ink is supplied to the recording head by the use of an ink supply tube.<br>
That is/ in a case of an ink cartridge 45 in which a flexible bag 41 containing ink therein and having an ink supply port 40 on one side thereof is accommodated in. a hard case 44 made up. of a case body 42 and a cover 43 in such a .way that the ink supply port 4.0 is exposed, the aforementioned one-push type fixing member 30 is 'formed on a side surface of the. hard case 44 -such that the front side as viewed in the direction of insertion becomes an opening portion.<br>
On the other hand, the other one-push type fixing member is formed such' that the fixing protrusion 12a is protruded from the 'rotational range limiting window 47 at the side of the ink cartridge accommodating holder 46 to be opposed to the fixing member 30. -A- resilient member 48 'is disposed on the side of .an ink supply needle 49. In this way, the cartridge 45- can be fixed into a predetermined position simply by pushing 'it in. • When the ink .cartridge 45 is removed, the ink cartridge .45 is pushed in against the resilient member 48' In this way, the ink cartridge 45 can be taken out.<br>
This embodiment can also employ, in place of the resilient member 48, a-valve arrangement having the valve body 23 installed in the ink supply port 22 and the spring 24 for biasing the valve body 23 toward the ink supply port side as discussed with reference to Fig. 5, in order to produce the same effect using the elastic<br>
 <br>
force of the spring for biasing the valve body.<br>
In the embodiment described above, a one-push type fixing member for receiving a fixing protrusion and another one-push type fixing member having the fixing protrusion are formed on the,ink cartridge and cartridge holder, respectively. It is apparent that, 'the same advantages can be obtained when one-push type fixing member 30 for receiving the fixing protrusion is arranged on the cartridge holder 9 -and another one-push 'type fixing member having the fixing protrusion 12a, 13a is arranged on the ink cartridge 5, 6 as shown in Figs. 12 and 13.<br>
