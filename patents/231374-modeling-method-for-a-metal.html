Description<br>
Modeling method for a metal<br>
The present invention relates to a modeling method for<br>
a metal, the temperature of which can be influenced<br>
directly or indirectly by at least one actuator,<br>
a starting temperature of the metal and starting<br>
proportions, in which the metal is at least in a<br>
first phase or a second phase, respectively, being<br>
predetermined for a material model,<br>
a heat conduction equation and a transformation<br>
equation being solved in real time within the<br>
material model, taking account of the starting<br>
temperature, the starting proportions and a control<br>
variable for the actuator, so as to determine an<br>
expected temperature for the metal and expected<br>
proportions in which the metal is at least in the<br>
first phase or the second phase, respectively,<br>
the actuator being actuated in accordance with the<br>
control variable.<br>
Methods of this type are known,	for example, from the<br>
article "Numerische Simulation	der Warmeleitung in<br>
Stahlblechen - Mathematik hilft	bei der Steuerung von<br>
Kuhlstrecken" [Numerical Simulation of the Heat<br>
Conduction in Steel Sheets -	Mathematics helps to<br>
control cooling sections] by	W. Borchers et al.,<br>
published in Unikurier der	Friedrich-Alexander-<br>
Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg,	Volume 102, October<br>
2001, 27th edition.<br>
The known methods are used in particular to control<br>
coolant actuators in rolling mills. The coolant<br>
actuators may be arranged between the rolling stands.<br>
They may also be arranged downstream of the rolling<br>
stands. However, there are also other conceivable<br>
applications, for example in the context of calculating<br>
solidification processes in continuous casting or in<br><br>
the control of rolling mills per se.<br><br>
In the prior art, the Scheil rule or the Johnson-Mehl-<br>
Avrami or Brimacombe approaches are used to determine<br>
the proportions of the phases.<br>
The approaches used in the prior art in practice are<br>
not without faults in all cases. In particular, they<br>
have a range of systematic drawbacks. Firstly, each<br>
material has to be parameterized separately.<br>
Interpolations between different materials are not<br>
possible or at least are only possible to a limited<br>
extent. Secondly, the methods of the prior art consider<br>
only two phases. The system cannot be expanded to cover<br>
more than two phases. Thirdly, the methods of the prior<br>
art only provide good correspondence between model and<br>
reality if the metal under consideration is completely<br>
transformed. Fourthly, the method of the prior art does<br>
not give any information about the transformation heat<br>
released during the phase transformation. However,<br>
knowledge of the transformation heat is imperative if<br>
the heat conduction equation is to be correctly solved.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
modeling method for a metal which gives better modeling<br>
results.<br>
The object is achieved by virtue of the fact that as<br>
part of the transformation equation the Gibbs' free<br>
energies of the phases of the metal are determined, a<br>
transformation rate of the metal from the first phase<br>
to the second phase is determined on the basis of the<br>
Gibbs' free energies and the expected proportions are<br>
determined on the basis oC the transformation rate.<br>
In the simplest case of the present invention - as in<br>
the prior art - a purely two-phase system is<br>
considered, for example a transformation from austenite<br>
into ferrite and vice versa. However, the invention can<br>
also readily be expanded to multiphase<br><br>
systems, in particular to the ferrite-austenite-<br>
cementite system.<br>
In general, the proportions of the additives cannot be<br>
considered independently of one another. The - albeit<br>
linked - influence of additives on the Gibbs' free<br>
energy is known, however. By way of example, reference<br>
is made to the specialist articles "Approximate<br>
Thermodynamic Solution Phase Data for Steels" by Jyrki<br>
Miettinen, Calphad, Vol. 22, No. 2, pages 275 to 300,<br>
1998, and "A Regular Solution Model for Phases with<br>
Several Components and Sublattices, Suitable for<br>
Computer Applications" by Bo Sundman and John Agren,<br>
Journal Phys. Chem. Solids, Vol. 42, pages 297 to 301.<br>
Therefore, for steel it is possible to determine the<br>
Gibbs' free energy of an iron-carbon mixture as a<br>
function of the proportion of carbon and the<br>
temperature and to take account of the effects of the<br>
additives, e.g. Ni, Si, P, as a function of the iron-<br>
carbon mixture, and also the temperature. If the<br>
material model is designed in such a manner that the<br>
proportions of the additives can also be predetermined<br>
for it, it is therefore possible to determine the<br>
Gibbs' free energies of the phases under consideration<br>
even for materials which are not explicitly<br>
predetermined.<br>
If specific Gibbs' free energies of the phases, i.e.<br>
Gibbs' free energies which are based on a uniform<br>
quantity of the metal, are determined, it is possible<br>
to determine the transformation rate in a particularly<br>
simple way, namely on the basis of the difference<br>
between the specific Gibbs' free energies.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to	determine the<br>
transformation rate :on the basis of	the sum of the<br>
specific Gibbs' free energies of the	phases, weighted<br>
with the proportions of the phases.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is possible to determine the<br>
transformation rate on the basis of the position<br>
integral over the specific Gibbs' free energies. This<br>
type of determination is advantageous in particular if<br><br>
the Gibbs' free energies of at least one of the phases<br>
are position-dependent.<br>
If the metal contains at least two chemically different<br>
constituents, the Gibbs' free energies can also be used<br>
to determine the distribution of the constituents<br>
between chemical compositions.<br>
The modeling method according to the invention can also<br>
be employed if at least one of the phases corresponds<br>
to a liquid state of the metal. However, it is also<br>
possible for at least one (and preferably all) of the<br>
phases to correspond to a solid state of the metal.<br>
It is possible for the method to be applied just once<br>
per metal. However, it is preferably applied at a<br>
multiplicity of locations in the metal which directly<br>
follow one another in terms of their position.<br>
If at least one desired temperature is predetermined<br>
for the material model, it is possible for the material<br>
model to automatically determine the control variable.<br>
The desired temperature may in this case in particular<br>
be a (temporal) desired temperature curve.<br>
The control variable may be a temporal control variable<br>
curve. In this case, it is possible in particular for<br>
the heat conduction equation and the transformation<br>
equation to be solved in steps using the control<br>
variable curve and in this way to determine an expected<br>
temperature curve for the metal and also expected<br>
proportion curves for the phases. In this case, the<br>
actuator is preferably only actuated after the heat<br>
conduction and transformation equations have been<br>
completely solved.<br>
However, the control variable may also be a single<br>
value. In this case, it is only used for one step in each<br><br>
case. In this case, the actuator is preferably actuated<br>
between the preceding step and the subsequent step.<br>
The modeling method operates particularly reliably if<br>
the starting temperature is an actual temperature<br>
recorded by a measuring element before the metal is<br>
influenced by the actuator.<br>
If a final temperature of the metal is recorded by a<br>
measuring element after the metal has been influenced<br>
by the actuator, the final temperature is compared with<br>
the expected temperature and the material model is<br>
adapted on the basis of the comparison, the material<br>
model becomes a self-teaching model.<br>
It is preferable for the heat conduction equation which<br>
is to be solved for the interior of the metal 1 to take<br>
the form<br><br>
where H is the enthalpy, t the time, **λthe thermal<br>
conductivity, p1 and p2 the proportions of the phases, p<br>
the density and T the temperature of the metal. q' is a<br>
heat quantity which is generated within the metal by<br>
external influences, e.g. deformation during rolling or<br>
inductive heating. The transformation heat produced on<br>
account of phase transformations, by contrast, is already<br>
taken into account in the left-hand part of the equation.<br>
The above, correct heat conduction equation can always<br>
be employed irrespective of the shape and state of the<br>
metal. If the. metal is in the form of a metal strip<br>
with a strip .thickness direction, it is possible to<br>
replace the equation given above by the simplified<br>
equation<br><br><br>
where x is the location in the strip thickness<br>
direction.<br>
Further advantages and details will emerge from the<br>
following description of an exemplary embodiment in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings,in which in each case<br>
in outline form,<br>
FIG. 1	shows an installation for influencing<br>
the temperature of a metal,<br>
FIGS 2 and 3 show material models,<br>
FIG. 4	shows a block diagram for solving a<br>
transformation equation,<br>
FIGS 5 and 6 show examples of curves for Gibbs' free<br>
energies, and<br>
FIGS 7 to 9 show further installations for<br>
influencing the temperature of a metal.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 1, an installation for<br>
influencing the temperature of a metal 1 has an<br>
actuator 2. The temperature T of the metal 1 can be<br>
influenced directly or indirectly by means of the<br>
actuator 2, generally by cooling, but in some cases<br>
also by heating. By way of example, a defined quantity<br>
of a cooling.medium (typically water) can be applied to<br>
the metal 1.<br>
In the present case, the metal 1 is steel in solid<br>
state. However, it could also be in a liquid state. The<br>
metal 1 could also be a metal other than steel, e.g.<br>
aluminum or a nonferrous metal. According to FIG. 1,<br>
the metal 1 is -furthermore designed as a metal strip',<br>
with a strip thickness direction. However, other forms<br>
of the metal 1, e.g. profiled sections in rod form<br><br>
(e.g. wires), tubes or U-sections are also conceivable.<br><br>
The installation is controlled by a control computer 3.<br>
In particular, the actuator 2 is also actuated by the<br>
control computer 3 in accordance with a control<br>
variable S. The control computer 3 is programmed with a<br>
computer program 4. On account of the programming with<br>
the computer program 4, the control computer 3 - in<br>
addition to controlling the installation - also carries<br>
out a modeling method for the metal 1, which is<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
As part of the execution of the modeling method, as<br>
shown in FIG. 2 a starting temperature TA of the metal<br>
1 and starting proportions plA, p2A, in which the metal<br>
1 is in a first phase or a second phase, respectively,<br>
are predetermined for a material model 5 for the metal<br>
1. The starting temperature TA may be an estimated<br>
value or a theoretically calculated value. Preferably,<br>
however - of. FIG. 1 - the installation has a<br>
measurement element 6. An actual temperature T of the<br>
metal can be recorded by means of the measuring element<br>
6. In the present case, this recording of the actual<br>
temperature T takes place before the metal 1 is<br>
influenced by the actuator 2. The actual temperature T<br>
recorded at this instant is the starting temperature<br>
TA, which is fed to the material model 5.<br>
The starting proportion plA/ p2A are generally values<br>
which are determined on the basis of calculations or<br>
are known on account of process conditions. For<br>
example, it is already known that the metal 1 is<br>
entirely in a liquid phase prior to casting.<br>
Alternatively, it is known that the material is<br>
austenite if steel is held for long enough at a<br>
temperature above the transformation temperature of<br>
steel .<br>
Within the material model 5, in accordance with FIG. 2,<br>
the material equations are solved in real time for the<br><br>
interior of the metal 1 taking account of these<br>
starting values TA, plA, p2A, the control variable S and<br>
the efficiency of the actuator 2. The material<br>
equations comprise a heat conduction equation of the<br>
form<br><br><br>
and a transformation equation. In the equations, H is<br>
the enthalpy, t the time, A. the thermal conductivity,<br>
p1 and p2 the proportions of the phases, p the density<br>
and T the temperature of the metal 1. q' is a heat<br>
quantity which is generated within the metal 1 by<br>
external influences, e.g. deformation during rolling or<br>
inductive heating. The transformation heat produced on<br>
account of phase transformations, by contrast, is<br>
already taken into account in the left-hand part of the<br>
equation. Within the material model 5, therefore, an<br>
expected temperature TE for the metal 1 and expected<br>
proportions p1E P2E in which the metal 1 is in the<br>
first phase or the second phase, respectively, are<br>
determined in real time.<br>
The solution to the heat conduction equation and also<br>
the way of taking account of the control variable S and<br>
the efficiency of the actuator 2 are generally known to<br>
those skilled in the art. Therefore, these details will<br>
not be dealt with further in the text which follows. It<br>
should merely be noted that the abovementioned heat<br>
conduction equation is the general equation to be<br>
solved irrespective of the state and shape of the metal<br>
1. In the present case, in which the metal 1 is in the<br>
form of a metal strip with a strip thickness direction,<br>
the heat conduction equation in accordance with FIG. 3<br>
can be formulated in one-dimensional form, since the<br>
gradients in the strip movement direction and in the<br>
strip width are substantially zero. In this case,<br>
therefor'e, the heat conduction equation can be<br>
simplified to<br><br><br>
where x is additionally the location in the strip<br>
thickness direction.<br>
Solving the transformation equation involves using a<br>
method which is explained in more detail below in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 4.<br><br>
In the illustration shown in FIG. 4, the simplifying<br>
assumption was made that the metal 1 can adopt two<br>
phases. However, the method can readily be expanded to<br>
a metal 1 comprising more than two phases.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 4, a plurality of input variables<br>
are fed to an equation solution block 7. First of all, a<br>
heat quantity Q' is fed to the equation solution block 7.<br>
The heat quantity Q' comprises firstly the change in the<br>
heat balance on account of heat conduction and secondly if<br>
appropriate also the heat quantity q' generated within the<br>
metal 1 by external influences.<br>
Then, the proportion p1 in which the metal 1 is in the<br>
first phase is fed to the equation solution block 7.<br>
The temporal change p1' is also fed to the equation<br>
solution block 7. On account of the fact that FIG. 4<br>
considers only a two-phase system, therefore, the<br>
proportion p2 of the second phase and its change p2'<br>
are also known.<br>
Finally, the enthalpies H1, H2 of the phases of the<br>
metal 1 are also fed to the equation solution block 7.<br>
The enthalpies H1, H2 are in this case based on a<br>
uniform quantity of the metal 1, for example one<br>
kilogram or one mol.<br>
The equation solution block 7 uses the linear equation<br>
system<br><br>
to determine the temporal changes H1', H2' in the<br>
enthalpies H1 and H2. These changes H1', H2' are fed to<br>
integrators 8, 9 which then determine the enthalpies<br>
H1, H2 as output signal.<br><br>
The integrators 8,	9 are suitably initialized with<br>
starting values Hl0,	H20. The starting values Hl0, H20<br>
in this case cannot	be predetermined independently of<br>
one another. Rather,	they have to be determined in such<br>
a way<br><br>
that the resulting specific Gibbs' free energies G1, G2<br>
adopt the same value at the phase transformation<br>
temperature.<br>
In the linear equation system, T1' and T2' are to be<br>
understood as meaning the first derivatives of the<br>
corresponding temperatures Tl, T2 according to the<br>
respective enthalpy H1 or H2, i.e. not the temporal<br>
derivatives.<br>
As an alternative to the linear equation system given<br>
above, it is also possible to solve a nonlinear<br>
equation system of the form<br><br>
H0 is in this case a suitable starting value for the<br>
enthalpy H of the system. This equation system directly<br>
gives the enthalpies H1, H2. On the other hand, as has<br>
already been mentioned, it is not linear.<br>
The determined enthalpy H1 is fed to a temperature-<br>
determining means 10, which uses the enthalpy H1 for<br>
the phase under consideration to determine the expected<br>
temperature Tl. Furthermore, the enthalpy H1 is fed to<br>
an entropy-determining means 11, which uses the<br>
relationship<br><br><br>
to determine the entropy S1 for the phase under<br>
consideration.<br>
The expected temperature T1 and the determined entropy<br>
S1 are fed to a multiplier 12, the output signal of<br>
which is fed - with a negative sign - to an adder 13,<br>
which is also fed with the enthalpy H1. The output<br>
signal from the adder 13 corresponds to the specific<br>
Gibbs' free energy G1 of the phase under consideration.<br><br>
The corresponding specific Gibbs' free energy G2 is<br>
determined analogously for the second phase. Then, the<br>
difference AG between the two specific Gibbs' free<br>
energies G1, G2 is formed in an adder 14.<br>
The difference AG between the specific Gibbs' free<br>
energies Gl, G2 determined in this way is fed to a<br>
means 15 for determining the transformation rate. This<br>
means uses the difference ΔG and the proportion p1 to<br>
determine the transformation rate. The transformation<br>
rate is fed to an integrator 16, which is additionally<br>
fed with the starting proportion p1A as starting value.<br>
The output signal from the integrator 16, i.e. the<br>
expected proportion p1E determined, is then fed back to<br>
the equation solution block 7 and the means 15 for<br>
determining the transformation rate.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 4, the transformation equation is<br>
solved in steps; in each step, the expected values<br>
previously determined are fed to the equation solution<br>
block 7. Similarly, the heat conduction equation is also<br>
solved in steps. Of course, the results of the heat<br>
conduction equation and transformation equation are<br>
adjusted after each step. The method is preferably applied<br>
for each reference point for the heat conduction equation.<br>
To save on calculation time, however, it is also possible<br>
to reduce the outlay involved in calculating the<br>
transformation model by combining reference points in the<br>
phase transformation. However, the heat conduction<br>
equation is always - i.e. in this case too - solved for<br>
each reference point.<br>
Furthermore, the temperatures T1, T2, if they are<br>
calculated correctly, have the same value, also referred<br>
to below as the expected temperature TE, at any instant.<br>
Any deviation between the temperatures Tl, T2 is therefore<br>
an indication that the material model 5 is less than<br>
optimum. It can therefore be used as part of the<br><br>
programming compilation of the material model 5 to<br>
optimize the material model 5<br><br>
- in particular the entropy- and temperature-<br>
determining means 10, 11.<br>
The method shown in FIG. 4, therefore, determines the<br>
temporal curves for the expected temperature TE and the<br>
expected proportions p13, p2E.<br>
In the case of the method shown in FIG. 4, the control<br>
variable S does not have to have the same value at any<br>
given instant. Rather, the control variable S may have<br>
a temporal curve, referred to below as the control<br>
variable curve. Therefore, the current value of the<br>
control variable S is also updated at each step. In the<br>
event of the treatment of the metal 1 only acting on<br>
the surface, for example when water is applied to the<br>
metal, it forms part of the boundary conditions which<br>
are to be observed when solving the heat conduction<br>
equation. If a treatment of the metal 1 affects its<br>
volume, for example a rolling operation or an inductive<br>
heating step, by contrast, the control variable S in<br>
particular forms part of the heat quantity Q'.<br>
If the heat conduction and material equations are<br>
solved in steps, two alternative procedures are<br>
possible. Firstly, the actuator 2 can be actuated in<br>
accordance with the predetermined control variable<br>
curve S after the temporal curves for the expected<br>
temperature TE and the expected proportions plE, p2E<br>
have been determined. Secondly, however, it is also<br>
possible to use only the control variable S for the<br>
corresponding step and to actuate the actuator 2 in<br>
accordance with the control variable S between the<br>
preceding step and the subsequent step.<br>
In both cases, it is possible for only the control<br>
variable S to be predetermined for the material model<br>
5. However, in accordance with FIGS 2 and 3, it is also<br>
possible for a desired temperature T* - or preferably<br><br>
even a temporal curve of the desired temperature<br>
T* - to be predetermined for the material model 5. In<br>
this case, it is possible for the material model 5 to<br>
determine the control variable S automatically on the<br>
basis of the desired temperature<br><br>
T*, the starting temperature TA and the efficiency of<br>
the actuator 2.<br>
After the metal 1 has been influenced by the actuator<br>
2, the actual temperature T of the metal 1 is recorded<br>
once again - in accordance with FIG. 1 by means of a<br>
further measuring element 6'. This temperature T,<br>
referred to below as the final temperature, is<br>
compared, as shown in FIG. 5, with the expected<br>
temperature TE by an adapter element 5' . The adapter<br>
element 5' then adapts the material model 5 on the<br>
basis of the comparison. By way of example, it is<br>
possible to vary heat transfer variables in the heat<br>
conduction equation or influencing variables for the<br>
transformation rates.<br>
In accordance with the exemplary embodiment given,<br>
therefore, the specific Gibbs' free energies Gl, G2 of<br>
the phases, which are based on a uniform quantity of<br>
the metal 1, are determined. The transformation rate is<br>
then determined on the basis of the difference AG. In<br>
the simplest case, the transformation rate results as a<br>
product of a constant with the determined difference<br>
AG. In this case, however, it. is advantageous to employ<br>
a means 15 for determining the transformation rate<br>
which determines the transformation rate p1' from the<br>
difference AG and the instantaneous phase proportion<br>
p1. A means 15 of this type for determining the<br>
transformation rate may, for example, be parameterized<br>
on the basis of a data set from TTT diagrams for<br>
various steels.<br>
Furthermore, it would be entirely equivalent for the<br>
transformation rate to be determined on the basis of<br>
the sum of the specific Gibbs' free energies Gl, G2<br>
weighted with the proportions p1, p2 of the phases.<br>
This makes use of the fact that the transformation, at<br>
a fixed temperature, automatically proceeds only in the<br><br>
direction of a decrease in the Gibbs' free energy G.<br>
The procedure described above in connection with FIG. 4<br>
is appropriate in particular in the case of a pure<br>
phase transformation with the same chemical<br>
composition, for example a pure transformation from<br>
austenite<br><br>
to ferrite. It can also be employed if there is a pure<br>
transformation from a solid phase to a liquid phase or<br>
vice versa.<br>
The above description of the determination of the<br>
proportions p1, p2 has in each case used the current<br>
instantaneous values for the specific Gibbs' free<br>
energies G1, G2, for the specific entropies S1, S2, for<br>
the specific enthalpies H1, H2 and the expected<br>
temperatures T1, T2. However, the evaluation performed<br>
by the temperature- and entropy-determining means 10,<br>
11 requires the functional curves or dependent<br>
relationships of the temperatures Tl, T2 and the<br>
specific entropies S1, S2 with respect to the<br>
corresponding specific enthalpies H1, H2 to be known.<br>
Therefore, in order to enable the phase transformations<br>
to be described successfully and correctly, it is<br>
necessary for basic functions which are dependent on<br>
the currently modeled metal 1, in particular on its<br>
chemical composition, to be made available to the<br>
temperature-determining means 10 and the entropy-<br>
determining means 11. For this purpose, when the<br>
material model 5 is being developed, it is preferable<br>
first of all to determine the specific Gibbs' free<br>
energies Gl, G2 for the phases of the substance under<br>
consideration as a function of the temperature.<br>
Determination of the specific Gibbs' free energy as a<br>
function of the temperature is described, for example, in<br>
the specialist article "A Thermodynamic Evaluation of the<br>
Fe-C System" by Per Gustafson in the Scandinavian Journal<br>
of Metallurgy 14 (1985), pages 259 to 267.<br>
It is then readily possible to determine the functional<br>
curves of the temperatures T1, T2 or of the specific<br>
entropies S1, S2 as a function of the specific enthalpy<br>
H1, H2 on :'the basis of the specific Gibbs' free energy<br>
G1 or G2 determined in this way as a function of the<br>
corresponding' temperature T1 or T2, respectively - i.e.<br><br>
the functional curves of the specific Gibbs' free<br>
energies G1, G2. This form of determination is one with<br>
which those skilled in the art will be generally<br>
familiar. For details,<br><br>
reference is made once again to the abovementioned<br>
article by Per Gustafson.<br>
When the functional curves of the specific Gibbs' free<br>
energies G1, G2 and also the functional curves of the<br>
temperatures T1, T2 and of the specific entropies S1,<br>
S2 are being determined, it is necessary in particular<br>
also to take into account the changes in the specific<br>
Gibbs' free energies G1, G2 that are caused by<br>
additives. Therefore, the changes to the specific<br>
Gibbs' free energies G1, G2 as a function of the added<br>
quantities of the additives under consideration are<br>
determined for the additives to be considered. Although<br>
with regard to the quantity of additive under<br>
consideration these changes may be highly nonlinear,<br>
they may also be dependent on one another. Both their<br>
aqtion and their dependent relationships with respect<br>
to one another are known, however, cf. the<br>
abovementioned articles by J. Miettinen and by<br>
B. Sundman and J. Agren. As a result, therefore, the<br>
temperature-determining means 10 and the entropy-<br>
determining means 11 are also intended for unknown<br>
mixtures if the proportions of the additives are known.<br>
Therefore, it is also possible to model unknown<br>
mixtures (in particular unknown steel compositions)<br>
with a high degree of accuracy.<br>
In practice, the metal 1 often has two chemically<br>
different base constituents. In the case of steel,<br>
these two constituents are typically iron (as the main<br>
constituent in amounts of significantly over 50 atom %)<br>
and carbon. In this case, first of all the specific<br>
Gibbs' free energy G is determined as a function of the<br>
(relative) proportion n of one of the two constituents<br>
and the temperature. Then, it is once again determined<br>
how this function changes for the additives under<br>
consideration. In this case too, however, the changes<br>
may be highly nonlinear. This is true both with regard<br><br>
to the quantities of the additives and with regard to<br>
the effect of the same quantities of the additives at<br>
various iron and carbon mixing ratios. Therefore, it is<br><br>
quite possible for a specific quantity of additives<br>
(e.g. 1% of silicon and 2% of phosphorus) to have a<br>
completely different effect on the specific Gibbs' free<br>
energy of an iron-carbon mixture comprising 1% of<br>
carbon and 99% of iron than on an iron-carbon mixture<br>
comprising 4% of carbon and 96% of iron. The percentages<br>
are in this case atomic percentages. It is also quite<br>
possible, for example, for double the quantity of the<br>
additives to have a completely different effect on the<br>
specific Gibbs' free energy than the single quantity of<br>
the additives. However, it is moreover the case that the<br>
influences of. the additives are known or can be<br>
determined in a known way.<br>
The curve of the specific Gibbs' free energy G<br>
determined in, this way for the iron-carbon mixture can<br>
be used to determine the distribution of the metal 1<br>
between chemical compositions of the constituents. This<br>
is explained in more detail below on the basis of the<br>
example of an iron-carbon mixture.<br>
Assume the presence of a mixture of iron and carbon. In<br>
this context, nA is the proportion of iron, nB the<br>
proportion of carbon in the mixture. The sum of the<br>
proportions nA, nB is of course one. Furthermore, assume<br>
that nA1 is the proportion of iron in a first chemical<br>
composition, nA2 is the proportion of iron in a second<br>
chemical composition. The sum of these proportions nA1,<br>
nA2 in this case of course corresponds to the total<br>
proportion nA of iron. Similarly, proportions nB1, nB2 of<br>
carbon are also contained in both compositions. The sum<br>
of these proportions nB1, nB2 once again results in the<br>
total proportion nB of carbon. With m1 = nA1 + nB1 and<br>
m2 = nA2 + nB2, proportions for the respective<br>
composition are introduced. Therefore, the Gibbs' free<br>
energy G of the overall system turns out to be<br><br><br><br>
(Complete) differentiation of this equation according to<br>
nA1 and nB1 and zeroing the derivatives gives two<br>
equations and therefore two conditions for the<br>
proportions nA1 and nB1- In this context, it must be borne<br>
in mind that in this equation m1, m2 and the argument of<br>
G2 implicitly include nA1 and nB1 as variables.<br>
If the Gibbs' free energy G of the iron-carbon mixture<br>
as a function of the proportion n of carbon has a<br>
convex curve, as illustrated by way of example in<br>
FIG. 5, it is not possible to divide it into two<br>
chemical compositions in which the proportionally<br>
weighted sum of the specific Gibbs' free energies G1,<br>
G2 is lower than the Gibbs' free energy of the<br>
uniformly mixed system. In this case, the equations are<br>
linearly dependent. The result is a uniform chemical<br>
composition of the metal 1.<br>
On the other hand, if, as illustrated by way of example<br>
in FIG. 6, the Gibbs' free energy G as a function of the<br>
carbon content is not exclusively convex, it is possible<br>
to perform this division into two different chemical<br>
compositions in which the proportionally weighted sum of<br>
the specific Gibbs' free energies Gl, G2 is lower than<br>
the Gibbs' free energy G of the uniform mixture. In this<br>
case, the equations are linearly independent. This<br>
results in unambiguous values for the proportions nA1,<br>
nA2, nB1 and nB2. In this case, the metal 1 is broken down<br>
into two different chemical compositions. The<br>
compositions have mixing ratios n1 or n2 . The mixing<br>
ratios n1, n2 are defined by the equations<br><br><br><br>
respectively.<br>
In practice, it is often necessary to employ mixtures<br>
of these two procedures. For example, a relatively<br>
large quantity of carbon is soluble in austenite. On<br>
the other hand, only a small quantity of carbon is<br>
sdluble in ferrite. Therefore, during cooling austenite<br>
breaks down into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite,<br>
wherein pearlite is a eutectic mix comprising cementite<br>
(Fe3C) and ferrite and has formed as a result of<br>
carbon-saturated austenite cooling to below the<br>
temperature of the surrounding walls.<br>
The phase transformation rate is described by what is<br>
known as a transformation diffusion model. In this<br>
case, the various phases are separated from one another<br>
by moveable phase boundaries. There are moveable and<br>
non-moveable elements within each phase. The non-<br>
moveable elements are distributed uniformly. The<br>
moveable elements are not generally distributed<br>
uniformly within the phase. The diffusion of the<br>
moveable elements in each phase is toward the negative<br>
gradient of the associated chemical potential. The<br>
diffusion rate of the moveable elements is in this case<br>
finite. The chemical potential is obtained by<br>
differentiation of the specific Gibbs' free energies<br>
(i.e. the Gibbs' free energies based on identical<br>
quantities) on the basis of the concentration of the<br>
moveable elements. The precise presentation of the<br>
diffusion for one or more moveable elements is known to<br>
those skilled in the art. To determine the speed at<br>
which the phase interface is moving, the difference<br><br>
between the specific Gibbs' free energies immediately<br>
in front of and immediately behind the phase interface<br>
is to be formed at the free phase interface. This task<br>
is referred to by those skilled in the art as the free<br>
boundary problem with diffusion or also as the Stefan<br>
problem and is generally known. An<br><br>
approximated solution is to be found, for example, in<br>
Kar, A. and Mazumder, J.: Analytic Solution of the<br>
Stefan Problem in Finite Mediums. Quart. Appl. Math.,<br>
Vol. 52, 1994.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a dedicated<br>
transformation rate can be determined for each<br>
transformation - both for a phase transformation per se<br>
and for decomposition of a chemical composition into<br>
other. chemical compositions. Overall, it can be stated<br>
that the transformation phenomenon at any time is<br>
moving in the direction of a decrease in the Gibbs'<br>
free energy G of the overall system. Therefore, the<br>
above model proposal can also be formulated without<br>
explicit use of the difference between the specific<br>
Gibbs' free energies G1, G2 at the phase interfaces. In<br>
particular taking account of the cooling behavior of<br>
the metal 1, therefore, it is possible to make a<br>
statement not only on the phase state of the metal 1<br>
but also on its microstructure and grain size.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 7, the installation is designed<br>
as a cooling device for the metal 1. The actuator 2 is<br>
designed as a' coolant actuator 2. It is either arranged<br>
between rolling stands of a rolling mill or downstream<br>
of the rolling stands. It can apply defined quantities<br>
of a . coolant, typically water, to the metal 1 via<br>
individually actuatable sections 2' .<br>
As has been stated above in connection with FIG. 1, the<br>
temperature T of the metal 1 is in each case recorded<br>
by means of measuring elements 6, 6' . If the cooling<br>
device is arranged exclusively downstream of the<br>
rolling stands, the measuring element 6 is arranged<br>
downstream of the final rolling stand and upstream of<br>
the cooling device. Otherwise, it is preferable for the<br>
measuring element 6 to be arranged upstream of the<br>
rolling stand (s) which precede (s) the cooling device<br><br>
and for the measuring element 6' to be arranged<br>
downstream of, the rolling stand (s) which precede(s) the<br>
cooling device.<br><br>
When the cooling section is operating, as part of the<br>
cycle, the starting temperature TA of the metal 1 is<br>
recorded by means of the measuring element 6 each time<br>
the heat conduction and transformation equations are<br>
being solved. Furthermore, a material velocity v is fed<br>
to the material model 5. This enables the material<br>
model 5 to carry out material monitoring with regard to<br>
the locations in the metal 1 at which the starting<br>
temperature TA was recorded, and in this way to actuate<br>
the individual sections 2' of the actuator 2 at the<br>
correct time. It is also possible for the final<br>
temperature . T to be recorded at the correct time by<br>
means of a further measuring element 6' at the end of<br>
the cooling section and for this temperature to be<br>
assigned to the corresponding location of the metal 1.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 7, therefore, the<br>
modeling method is applied at a multiplicity of<br>
locations in the metal 1 which directly follow one<br>
another in terms of their position.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 7, the direction of flow<br>
of the material is always identical. However, it is<br>
also possible for the direction of flow of the material<br>
to change. For example, in the case of a plate mill<br>
train, the material can be returned to the rolling<br>
stand for cooling purposes and subjected to a further<br>
rolling operation with a subsequent cooling operation.<br>
FIGS 8 and 9 show further possible applications for the<br>
modeling method according to the invention.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 8, the installation is designed<br>
as a rolling mill train. In the present case, the<br>
actuator 2 is one of the rolling stands, and the<br>
corresponding control variable S is the rolling speed.<br>
If appropriate, the actuator 2 may also be a<br>
combination of a rolling stand and a cooling device. In<br>
this case, of course, the control variable S is also a<br><br>
combined control variable.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, the installation is<br>
designed as a continuous-casting installation. The<br>
actuator 2 is designed as a combined actuator, by means<br>
of which on the one hand the<br><br>
cooling of the permanent mold of the continuous-casting<br>
installation is influenced, and on the other hand the<br>
discharge velocity v at which the cast strand 1 is<br>
discharged from the permanent mold.<br>
The present invention has numerous advantages. Firstly,<br>
the material model 5 of the present invention, given<br>
complete parameterization with respect to the possible<br>
additives, makes it possible to obtain generally valid<br>
results which allow the treatment even of unknown<br>
material classes and individual materials.<br>
Furthermore - unlike with the approaches used by Scheil<br>
and Avrami - the transformation behavior is described<br>
correctly even in the case of incomplete<br>
transformation. In this case, unlike in the methods of<br>
the prior art, the transformation heat produced during<br>
the phase transformation is determined correctly and<br>
taken into account within the scope of the material<br>
model 5. In particular, however, the complicated<br>
topology of phase diagrams and TTT diagrams is returned<br>
to the parameterization of standard smooth curves. As a<br>
result, technical processing of the dependent<br>
relationship among alloying elements, which is<br>
extremely complex in the case of steel, becomes<br>
possible for the first time, since if the pressure and<br>
temperature T of the system under consideration - in<br>
this case of the metal 1 - are kept constant, the<br>
Gibbs' free energy G of the system seeks to adopt its<br>
minimum value. A comparison of the Gibbs' free energies<br>
G1, G2 of various phases therefore indicates the<br>
direction of the phase transformation. In this case, it<br>
is even possible to process the extremely difficult<br>
case of a metal with additives and compounds such as<br>
cementite (Fe3C) as phases in a physically correct<br>
manner. Finally, the approaches can be applied not only<br>
to temperature calculation but also to the calculation<br>
of microstructure and grain size.<br><br>
