'[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to an activator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor 5.<br>
[Prior art]<br>
The peroxisome is a small organ present in cells of animals and plants, and its matrix contains various en¬zymes such as catalases. Various compounds such as fi-brates, herbicides, and phthalic acid plasticizers are known as peroxisome proliferators which induce prolifera¬tion of peroxisomes,<br>
Isseman, et al. have identified a nuclear receptor which is activated by peroxisome proliferator and called<br>
it peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR).  	<br>
Nature, 347, p645-650, 1990.<br>
Three subtypes such as PPARa, PPARy and PPAR6 have<br>
been identified.  	 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91,<br>
p7335-7359, 1994.<br>
The above-mentioned fibrates used as the serum triglyceride (TG) lowering drug can modulates PPAR6 activ¬ity.<br>
Further, thiazolidine compounds {Troglitazone, Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone) useful in the treatment of diabetes are also known as ligands of PPAR-y.<br>
It is reported that several compounds such as GW-2433 (Glaxo Wellcome), L-I65041 (Merck), and yM-16638 (Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical) activate PPAR5.  Each formula is as follows:<br><br><br><br>
vy<br><br><br>
Ho-V-^0<br>
CO2H<br><br>
YM-16638<br>
WO 92/10468 describes that GW-2433 can be used for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.<br>
WO 97/28115 describes that L-165041 can be used for treatment of diabetes and suppression of obesity.<br>
WO 99/04815 describes that YM-16638 shows effects for reducing serum cholesterol and reducing LDL choles¬terol .<br>
Recently, JBC, 272(6), p3406-341D, 1997 and Cell, 99, p335-345, 1999 describe proposal for application of PPAR 6 ligand as an anti-cancer agent and an anti-inflam¬matory agent.<br>
The following compounds A to E have a structure similar to the compound of the present invention (men¬tioned below) , in rdore detail a benzisoxazole derivative of the general formula (I).  The compound A is disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2,581,523, the compound B is dis¬closed in WO 98/28254, the compound C is disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 8(1996)-311065, the compound D is disclosed in WO 97/27190, and the compound E is disclosed in WO 96/20935.

I.	Method<br>
HDL cholesterol elevating effect was measured by us¬ing db/db mice, which are hereditary obesity mice.  The db/db mice (10 weeks old) were divided into groups tased on serum HDL cholesterol levels.  Each of the compounds of the present invention (compounds synthesized in Examples 4 and 10) and GW-501516 was orally administered for one week twice daily.  Mice of the control group (to which no agent was administered) were orally given 1% methyl cel¬lulose solution.  After 16 hours from the final admini¬stration, blood sample was collected, and serum HDL cho¬lesterol level was measured.  HDL cholesterol was sepa¬rated by electrophoresis on agarose gels (Choi/Trig Combo, Helena Laboratories).  Serum total cholesterol lev¬els were measured enzymaticallly using a kit (Pure Auto, Daiichi Chemicals) by an automatic analyzer (7060E type, Hitachi Ltd.).  HDL cholesterol levels were calculated from total cholesterol levels and HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol ratios.<br>
