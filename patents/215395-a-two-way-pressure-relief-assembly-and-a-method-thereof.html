				<td>TWO WAY PRESSURE RELIEF ASSEMBLY AND METHOD<br>
This invention relates to pressure relieving rupture disk assemblies, and more particularly, to an improved two-way pressure relieving assembly which will accurately operate at low pressures.<br>
The use of various types of rupture disks to prevent overpressure in a fluid pressure containment structure are known. Generally, such devices have Included a rupture disk supported between a pair of support members or flanges which are in turn connected to 'a relief passageway in a vessel or system containing fluids under pressure. When the fluid pressure within ths vessel o- system exceeds the predetermined rupture pressure of tha disk, rupture occurs, causing pressurized fluid to be relieved from the vessel or system.<br>
Rupture disks of the reversa buckling, type have beer developed and used successfully. Reverse buckling rupture disks generally include a dome-shaped portion and the fluid pressure from the vessel or system being protected is exerted on the convex side, of the dome, Upon failure, the dome-shaped portion reverses and then ruptures. Originally, most reverse buckling ruptjre disks assemblies included knife blades positioned adjacent to the ruoture disk on the concave side of the disks. On reversal, the disks impaled on tha knife blades causing them to open in a predetermined manner. More recently, reverse buckling disks have included scores or lines of weakness on a surface of the d;sk so that upon reversal the disks tear along the scores or lines of weakness.<br>
While scored reverse buckling rupture disks have been used successfully snd hove eliminated The need for knife blades in high pressure applications, scored rc.verse buckling rupture disks have only achieved varying cegrees of success in low pressure applications. Consequently, knife blaaes have had to be utilized with reverse buckling rupture disks utilized in low pressure applications. The inclusion on the knife blades causes the rupture disk assemblies TO be relatively expensive.<br>
Further, the reverse buckling rupture disks using scores und/or knives have a satisfactory rupture pressure predictability in the reverse buckling direction, but their ability to provide sufficiently predictable rupture pressures in both directions has not bean satisfactory.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,368,180 issued November 29, 15)94 to Farwell et al., assigned to the assignee of this application, and Incorporated herein by reference, discloses a perforated rupture disk assembly designed to eliminate the need for knife blades and to provide pressure relief at relatively low relief pressures. Although, as indicated in the Farwell patent, the perforated :-upture disk assembly will allow pressure relief in both directions; the accuracy and predictability of the rupture pressure from the concave side of the disk Is less than desirable. Farwell docs not disclose or suggest apparatus or method for selectively adjusting the rupture pressure of a rupture disk ether than through the use of perforations in the rupture disk.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,901,259 issued August 26, 1975 to Banbury discloses a safety pressure relief apparatus having a reverse buckling pressure relief disk secured by Its edge region between two support members siolely by virtue of the axial pressure exerted on the disk by the support members. The area of the edge region of the disk is such that when the disk is reversed upon build up of pressure within a vessel, the reverse buckling disk reverse buckles and the edge region is released from between the two support member$ by radially Inward movement of the disk. Banbury discloses varying the width of the edge of the disk being gripped and the axial pressure thereon to control the reverse buckling rupture pressure. Banbury does not disclose or suggest using the pressure reliuf apparatus to relieve pressure in the non-reverse buckling direction, or any structure for accurately predetermining or adjusting the relief pressure in the non reverse buckling direction.<br>
There is a need fa' a two-way pressure relief assembly which will relieve overpressures accurately and predictably at a wide range of pressures, including low relieving pressures; which will operate accurately and predictably at low<br>
pressure relieving ratios (the ratio of the inlet relieving pressure to the outlet relieving pressure); which may be used with reverse buckling and non-reverse buckling (tension) disks; which provides structure and method other than the disk, for accurately adjusting the magnitude of the relief pressure in both directions; and which provides structure and method for adjusting the ratio of the two relief pressures in the two-way pressure relief assembly.<br>
The present invention Is contemplated to overcome the foregoing deficiencies and meet the above described needs. In accomplishing this, the present invention provides a novel and improved two-way prassure relief assembly.<br>
The two-way pressure relief assembly may be sealingly clamped between fnlat and outlet clamps in a pressure containment passageway and includes a disk having a peripheral flange extending from the disk for clamping the disk between the inlet and outlet clamps. The disk has an inlet side, and outlet side, and a central axis extending through the inlet end outlet sides. The Inlet side of the disk has a selected inlet relief pressure which, when exerted on the inlet side, will cause the flange and disk to pull out of the inlet and outlet clamps and move toward the outlet side, thereby allowing pressure relief through the assembly, The outlet side of the disk has an outlet relief pressure which, when exerted on the outlet side, will cause the flange and disk to pull out of the inlet and outlet clamps and move toward th* inlet side, thereby allowing pressure relief through the assembly. A pressure support may be disposed on the inlet side of the disk between the peripheral flange of the disk and the inlet clamp for increasing the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude.<br>
It is en advantage of the present Invention to provide a two-way pressure relief assembly which will operate accurately and predictably at low relieving pressures.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a two-way pressure relief assembly which will operate accurately and predictably at low pressure relief ratios.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a two-way pressure relief assembly which will operate accurately and predictably, without premature failure, when exposed to a large number of rising and falling pressure cycles.<br>
The present invention relates to a two-way pressure relief assembly for a pressure containment passageway, the assembly comprising: a disk having a peripheral flange portion configured to be clamped between an inlet clamp and an outlet clamp in the passageway, the rupture disk having an inlet sidefacing the inlet clamp, an outlet side facing the outlet clamp, and a central axis extending substantially perpendicular thereto, characterized in that: the disk is configured to be pulled out from between the inlet and outlet clamps when either the pressure on the inlet side exceeds a predetermined inlet relief pressure or the pressure on the outlet side exceeds a predetermined outlet relief pressure, wherein the assembly comprises a pressure adjusting member exerting a pressure on the peripheral flange portion so as to selectively adjust the magnitude of at least one of the inlet and outlet relief pressures.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of providing a two-way pressure relief in a pressure containment passageway, said method comprising: sealingly clamping the peripheral flange of the disk of the relief assembly as defined in any preceding claim between inlet and outlet clamps in the passageway, and adjusting the clamping of the peripheral flange to cause the flange and disk to pull out from between the inlet and outlet clamps and move towards the outlet side when a selected inlet relief pressure is exerted on the inlet side, thereby allowing pressure relief through the assembly, and to cause the flange and the disk to pull out from between the inlet and outlet clamps and move towards the inlet side when a selected outlet relief pressure is exerted on the outlet side of the disk, thereby allowing pressure relief through the assembly.<br>

Figures 1-14 present embodiments of the two-way pressure relief assembly 20 and method of the present Invention. Although the invention is described herein as being used in relatively low pressure application, it is Intended to be understood that the invention may be used in a wide range of pressure magnitudes. Referring to the example of Rgure 1, in a preferred embodiment, the pressure relief assembly 20 may be generally described as including a disk 22 and a pressure support 24, Although the disk 22 is depicted and described herein as having a generally round outside perimeter, it is intended to be understood that the disk 22, as well es the structure and passageway (n which it is sealingly contained, may have virtually any peripheral chape, e.g., square, rectangular, triangular, octagonal, etc. As would be understood by one skilled in the art in view of the disclosure herein, there are a number of known factors which will influence the relief pressures in the assembly 20, such as the surface friction between the<br>
components; the axial pressure or compression exerted on the disk 22, pressure support 24, and gaskets; the crown height and thickness of the disk 22; and the like. For purposes of this application It Is assumed such known factors ire of constant value. The inventive assembly 20 provides structure end method for improving the accuracy, predictability, and adjustability of the relief pressures over the known factors.<br>
The disk 22 has a peripheral flange 26 extending radlnlly outwardly from the disk 22 for clamping the disk 22 between an inlet clamp 28 end an outlet clamp 30 in a passageway 32. When so clamped, the disk 22 seals the passageway 32 and sealingly contelns pressure exerted on either side of the disk.<br>
The disk 22 has an Inlet side 34, outlet side 36, and a central axis 38 extending through the inlet and outlet sides 34, 36 of the disk 22. The Inlet side 34 of the disk 22 has a selected, predetermined inlet relief pressure (more accurately described as the differential pressure between the Inlet side 34 and outlet side 38 of the disk 22} which, when exerted on the inlet side 34 will cause the flange 26 and disk 22 to pull from between the Inlet and outlet clamps 28, 30 and move toward the outlet clamp 28 thereby allowing pressure relief through the assembly 20. The outlet side 36 of the disk 22 has predetermined outlet relief pressure (more accurately described as the differential pressure between the outlet side 36 and inlet side 34 of the disk 22} which, when exerted on the outlet fide 36 will cause the flange 26 and disk 22 to pull from beiween inlet and outlet clamps 28, 30 and move toward the inlet clamp 28, thereby allowing pressure relief through the assembly 20. As beet seen in Figures 15 and 16, in the preferred assembly 20, the disk flange 26 includes a hinge means or hinge portion 42 for securing the disk between the inlet and outlet clamps 28, 30 during and after presuure relief from either side 34, 36 of the disk in order to retain the disk 22 within the assembly 20. The preferred hinge portion 42 is a radially outward extension of the disk flange 26 which extends sufficiently into the inlet and outlet<br>
clamps 28, 30 that the hinge portion 42 wilt not pull out of the clamps 28, 30 with the remainder of the flange 26 when the inlet or outlet relief pressure is exceeded.<br>
As exemplified in Figure 16, In order to facilitate assembling the assembly 20 and reduce the likelihood of damaging the disk 22, the disk 22 may Include a support flange 40 circumscribing the disk peripheral flange 2:6 and separated from the flange 26 by an arcuate alot 41 which is out through the disk 22. The slot 41 is sized so that the support flange 40 does not affect the Inlet and outlet relief pressures of tha disk 22.<br>
Referring to the example of Figure 1, the pressure support 24 is disposed on the inlst side 34 of the disk 22 between the peripheral flange 26 and the inlet clamp 28 for increasing the outlet relief pressure to a selected, predetermined magnitude. The preferred pressure support 24 includes a peripheral flange 46, disposed for clamping between the inter side 34 of the peripheral flange 26 of tha disk 22 and the Inlet clamp 28; and an Inside edge 48 defining a central portion 50. As exnmplified in Figures 1 and 4, In one embodiment, the central portion 50 of the pressure support 24 is open and provides no direct support to the inlet side 34 of tha disk 22, the disk 22 being supported by the peripheral flange 46 of the pressure support 24.<br>
Referring to the example of Figures 2, 3, and 5, the inside edge 48 of the pressure support 24 may be selectively extended towards the central axis 38 relative to the disk flange 26 in order to reduce the size of the open central portion 50 and to increase the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. Conversely, the inside edge 48 of the pressure support 24 may be selectively extended away from the central axis 38 relative to the disk flange 26 In ordar to increase the size of the open central portion 50 and to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The inside edge 48 of the pressure support 24 should at least slightly overlap the inlet side 34 of the disk flange 26. Intermediate gasket 44 may be provided to Improve the sealing properties of the contact between the pressure support 24 and tha disk 22.<br>
Referring to the example of Figure 5, in another embodiment/ the pressure support 24 includes at laast one support member 52 extending across the central portion SO of the pressure support 24 for supporting the inlet side 34 of the disk 22 against pressure from the outlet side 36 of the disk 22. As exemplified In Figure 5, multiple support members 52 may be used and arranged as needed to provide the required support. The hub and spoke arrangement of Figure 5 is intended as an example of a typical arrangement, as would be known to one skilled in the art in view of the disclosure contained herein.<br>
Referring to the example of Figure 6, in another embodiment, the support member 52 extends across or covers the entire central portion. 50 with at laast two openings 94 in the support member 52. The number and size of the openings 54 may be varied to adjust the strength and flow characteristics of the pressure support 24, as would be known to one skilled In the art in view of the disclosure contained herein. Referring to the examples of Figures 5 and 6, the more preferred support member 82 includes at least one weaker area 56 of selected pressure supporting weakness with respect to the remainder of the support member 52. The weakness of the weaker ares 56 is selected to determine the outlet relief pressure. The weaker area 56 may be formed by removing material from the support member, perforating the support member, providing score lines to weaken the support member and other methods which would be kiown to one skilled in the art In view of the disclosure contained herein. The weaker areas 56 may be arranged to predetermine the portion and shape of the pressure support 24 which will open during an overpressure or pressure relieving event. The weaker areas 56 may be omitted from the area of the pressure support 24 ulignad with the hinge portion 42 of the disk 22 so that the pressure support 24 will be retained within the assembly 20 after a pressure relieving event.<br>
Referring to the example of Figure 2, the disk 22 and disk flange 26 may be generally planar in the radial or diametrical dimension, with the structure and features of the pressure support 24, centra! portion 50, and support members 52<br>
conforming to the planar shape, as would be known to one skilled in the art in view<br>
of the disclosure contained herein. In the more preferred embodiment, referring to<br>
the example of Figure 3, the Inlet side 34 of the disk 22 indudw a protuberance<br>
64 extending from the central portion 50 of the disk towards the inlet clamp 28<br>
and the outlet side 36 of the disk 22 includes a recess 66 of substantially the same<br>
shape and size as the protuberance 64.   Preferably, the protuberance 64 and<br>
recess 66 ere f ormed et the same time in the material of wh ch the disk 22 is made<br>
and the recass  66 has substantially the same radius of curvature as the<br>
tuberanee 64. The protuberance 64 may take virtually liny protuberant shape,<br>
such es a cone, frustocone, frustum, pyramid, or the like, arid the protuberance 64<br>
be symmetrical or asymmetrical about the central axis 38 of the disk 22 with<br>
recess having substantially the same shape, It Is conttmplated that the most<br>
monly used disk will have a generally dome-shaped protuberance 64, as<br>
exemplified in Figure 34<br>
Referring to the examples of Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6, the pressure support 24<br>
48 a selected distance towards the central axis 38 of disk 22 in order to crease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude d to leave the cenfl portion 50 of the pressure support 24 open, wrth the axially correspondlngftion of the Inlet side 34 of the disk 22 unsupported.Figure 2, preferably the inside edge 48 of the pressure by the inside edge region 68. defines a plane about perpendicular TO the Jnl axis 38 of the disk 22.<br>
Figure. "7, In one embodiment the inside edge 48 ncludes at least one notch or scallop 72 in order to ^pressure to a selected magnitude   The notch or notches <br>
example of Figure 3, in another embodiment, the inside edge 48 of the pressure support 24 Is flared towards the disk 22 to increase the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. As exemplified in Figure 9, the inside odge 48 of the pressure support may be flared away from the disk 22 to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude, Referring to the example of Figure 10, in another embodiment,, the protuberance 64 is defined as having • radius of curvature 74 and the Inside edge region 68 of the pressure support 24 is defined as having a radius of curvature 76. The radius of curvature 76 of the inilde edge region 68 is increased relative to the radius of curvature 74 of the protuberance 64 in order to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The radius of curvature 76 of the Inside edge region 68 mey be selectively decreased relative to the radius of curvature 74 of the protuberance 64 in order to increase the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude.<br>
As previously mentioned, in both the planar disk 22 of Figure 2 and the protuberant disk 22 of Figure 3, the pressure support 24 may include at least one support member 52 (best seen in Figures 5 and 6) extending across the open central portion 50 of the pressure support 24 for supporting the inlet side 34 of the disk 22 against pressure from the outlet side 36 of the disk 22. The support member 52 should generally conform to the shape of the disk 22 and when the disk 22 has a protuberance 64 the support member 52 should normally have about the same radius of curvature as the protuberance 64. The radius of curvature of the support member 52 may be decreased with respect to the radius of curvature of the pratubarance 64 In order to increase the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude; and may be increased relative to the radios of curvature of the protuberance 64 in order to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. Further, the support member 82 may substantially close or cover the entire central portion 50 of the pressure support 24 and openings 64 may be provided in the support member to selectively increase and decrease the magnitude of the outlet relief pressure, as previously discussed. lsreferably, the support member includes at least one weaker ares 56 of selected pressure supporting weakness with respect to the remainder of the sup port member 52, The weakness of the weaker area 56 is selected to predetermine the magnitude of the outlet relief pressure.<br>
Referring to the example embodiment of Figures 1-3, the assembly 20 may also Include an Intermediate gasket 44, disposed between the peripheral flange 26 of the diak 22 and the peripheral flange 46 of the pressure support 24. The Intermediate gasket may further Include an Inside edge region 82 and an inside edge 84 (Figure 2) which are co-extensive with and conform to the shape of the Inside edge region 68 and Inside edge 48 of the pressure support 24. In this configuration, the intermediate gasket 44 fills what would otherwise be a void or partial void between the inside edge region 68 of the pressure support 24 and the Inlet side 34 of the disk 22 and prevents residue from building up in the spaoe filled by the intermediate gasket 44. This can be of great importance and advantage when the assembly 20 is used in highly sterile or clean applications such as are necessary in the semi-conductor industry.<br>
Referring to the example embodiment of Figures 1-3, the assembly 20 includes inlet gaaket means 90 disposed on the inlet side 92 of the pressure support 24 between the pressure support 24 and the inlet clamp 28 for adjusting the outlet relief pressure to a velected magnitude. Referring to the example embodiment of Figure 1. the preferred inlet gasket means SO includes a peripheral inlet gasket, also designated 90, having an inside edge 94 defining an open central portion 96 of the inlet gasket 90. The inside edge 94 of the inlet gasket 90 is extended towards the central axis 38 relative to the peripheral flange 26 of the disk 22 in order to reduce the size of the open central portion 50 and tp increaee the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The inside edge 94 of the inlet gasket 90 is extended away from the central axis 38 of tho disk 22 relative to the peripheral flange 26 of the disk 22 in order to increase the open of the open central portion 50 and to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The inside edge 94 of the Inlet gasket 90 should at least slight^ overlap the Inlet side 34 of the disk flange 26. The hardness-and/or stiffness of the inlet gasket means 90 may be selectively increased to Increase the outlet rallel pressure to a selected magnitude. The hardness and/or stiffness of the inlet gasket means 90 may be selectively decreased to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The axial thickness of the Inlet gasket means 90 may be selectively increased to increase the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The axial thickness of the Inlet gasket means 90 may be selectively decreased to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude.<br>
Referring to the example embodiment of Figure 11, the inside edge 94 of the Inlet gasket 90 may be selectively skewed towards the central axis 38 and the disk 22 in order to Increase the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The Inside edge 94 of the inlet gasket 90 may be selectively skewed toward the central axis 38 and the Inlet clamp 28 In order to decrease the outlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude, as best seen in Figure 12. These properties of the skewed inside edge 94 may be accomplished by linearly skewing the Inside edge 94 or by skewing the inside edge 94 with a concave or convex radius, as would be known to one skilled in the art in view of the disclosure contained herein.<br>
Referring to the example embodiment of Figures 1-3, the assembly 20 may also include outlet gasket means, or peripheral outlet geskot, 100 disposed on the outlet side 36 of the disk 22 between the peripheral flange; 26 of the disk 22 and the outlet clamp 30 for adjusting the Inlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude. The outlet gasket 100 has an inside edge 102 defining an open central portion 104 of the outlet gasket 100. The Inside edge 102 of the outlet gasket 100 may be extended towards the central axis 38 relative to the peripheral flange 26 of the disk 22 in order to reduce the size of the open central portion 104 and to increase the inlet relief pressure to a selected magnitude.

Referring to the example of Figures 1-3, a proteiype of the inventive assembly 20 and method will now be described in greater detail to facilitate a better understanding of the invention- tn the prototype assembly 20, an inlet bite 112 is formed in the inlet clamp 28. An outlet bite 114 is formed in the outlet damp 30. The preferred inlet and outlet bltts 112, 114 circumscribe and define the flow passageway 32 through the assembly 20. As beist exemplified in Figure 1, the preferred bites 112, 114 are about annular and extend axially toward one another when the inlet and outlet clamps 28, 30 are assembled, The inlet clamp 28 includes an inlet stop 116 circumscribing the Inlet bite 112. The outlet clamp 30 includes an outlet stop 118 circumscribing the outlet bite 114. As best seen in Figures 2 and 3, when the inlet and outlet damps 28, 30 are assembled with the disk 22 held between the inlet and outlet bites 112,114, the Inlet and outlet stops 116, 118 are in hard contact, while the inlet and outlet bites 112, 114 have a pre¬selected axial distance separating them, The distance between the inlet and outlet bites 112, 114 is selected to provide a desired, constant compression on the disk 22, pressure support 24, and gaskets 44,90,100. In the prototype assembly 20, the inlet clamp 28 includes an annular inlet relief cavity 12:? between the inlet bite 112 and inlet stop 116. Preferably, the outlet clamp 30 includes an annular outlet relief cavity 124 between the outlet bite 114 and outlet stop 118. The peripheral flange 26 of the disk 22, excepting the hinge portion 42,, terminates within the annulus defined by the inlet and outlet bites 112, 114 so that the inlet and outlet bites 112r 114 exert the desired compression on the desired area of the disk flange 26. Preferably, the pressure support 24 and gaskets 44, !JO, 100 extend radially outwardly into the inlet and outlet relief cavities 122, 124, as does the hinge portion 42 of the disk 22. Either of the inlet relief cavity 1 V.2 or outlet relief cavity 124 may be eliminated.<br>
The Inlet and outlet clamps 28, 30 (commonly referred to as "heads") are normally sealingly clamped between pipe flanges or the like in a pressure containment system, as would be known to one skilled in the art in view of the<br>
disclosure contained herein. It is intended to be understood that the inlet and outlet bites 112, 114 may be used with the inventive assembly 20 Independently of the inlet and outlet stops 116, 118; and the inlet anc outlet bites 112, 114 and/or inlet and outlet stops 116, 118 may be integrally formed in a pressure containment structure, flanges, or other piping or pressure vessel components, as would be known to one skilled tn the art In view of the disclosure contained herein.<br>
It is also intended to be understood that the terms "Inlet" and "outlet" are used throughout this document to simplify the description and facilitate understanding. Since the inventive assembly 20 is a two-way pressure relieving assembly, either side of the disk 22 may be considered tho inlet or outlet; and the ultimate orientation of the assembly 20 will depend upon the technical requirements and operating conditions of a specific situation. More specifically, it Is contemplated that the assembly 20 will often be used in situations requiring two-way pressure relief at two different relief pressures, i.e., the relief pressure in one direction will be higher than that of the other, if the assembly is used with a domed or reverse buckling disk, normally a higher pressure Is required to open the disk from the concave side, and therefore the concave :tlde of the disk would normally be oriented towards the source of higher pressure, regardless of inlet and outlet designations.<br>
The prototype assembly 20, beginning on the inlet side, includes an annular inlet gasket 90, an annular stiffening ring 120, the pressure support 24, an annular intermediate gasket 44, the disk 22, and an annular outlet ijesket 100. Depending upon the operating conditions and requirements of the environment in which the assembly 20 will be used, the only components which will be used in every situation are the Inlet and outlet clamps 28, 30, disk 22, and either the pressure support 24 or the inlet gasket 90.<br>
As previously mentioned, in the prototype and preferred embodiments, the clamps 28, 30 provide a constant compression on the components of the disk assembly 20 clamped between them. Therefore, the other components are<br>
selected and adjusted to provide the desired operating filatures of the two-way pressure relieving assembly. For example, it is contemplated that where a low pressure ratio between the inlet and outlet relief pressure is desired (a low pressure ratio is typically between 1.0 and 4.0) the pressure relieving assembly will include the Inlet gasket SO and disk 22, and the pressure suppor; 24 may be eliminated. The outlet gasket 100 may be used if necessary to fine tune the inlet relief pressure or to prevent leakage. The outlet relief pressure will be predetermined by adjusting the inside diameter of the Inlet gasket 90 and properly selecting the axial •thickness and hardness of the inlet gasket 90. The stiffening ring, which typically has a significantly larger inside diameter than the gaskets 90, 100 may be added for handling purposes, i.e., to prevent damage in handling the assembly 20 which may be made of very thin and easily damaged materials lit low pressure ratings.<br>
At intermediate pressure ratios (typically between 1,8 and 6.0) it is contemplated that the inlet and outlet gaskets 90,100 will be used predominantly to prevent leakage, the stiffening ring 120 may be used to prevent damage in handling, and the pressure relieving properties of the assembly will be determined by the pressure support 24 and disk 22. Assuming the disk 22 is a reverse buckling disk, The inlet relief pressure will be predominantly determined by the thickness and radius of curvature 74 of the disk 22. The outlet relief pressure will be determined predominantly by the inside diameter of the pressure support 24 (the size of the open central portion 50L the radius of curvature 76 of the inside edge region 68 of the pressure support 24 (Rgure 10), the placement of notches 72 in the Inside edge 48 of the pressure support 24 (Figure 5), and/or the flaring of the inside edge of the pressure support 24 (Figures 8 and 9). <br>
If a high pressure ratio (typically between 3.0 ami 25.0) is required, it is contemplated that a full pressure support will be used, i.e., a pressure support having support members 52 extending across the central portion 50, The support members 52 and weaker areas 56 In these support members 52 will be selected to give the desired outlet relief pressure. Normally the radius of curvature and<br><br>
thickness of the disk protuberance 64 will have the most Influence on the inlet relief pressure, although this may be fine tuned by adjusting the inside diameters, hardnesses, and thicknesses of the inlet and outlet gaskets 90,100, as previously discussed. It should be noted that, when a disk 22 having a protuberance 64 is used, decreasing the inside diameter of the outlet gasket smaller than the diameter of the recess 66 has little effect on the relief pressures.<br>
