				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
the present invention relates to a crystalline non-solvated<br>
anhydrous form of 6-hydroxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)<br>
ethoxy] , phenoxy)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) benzo [b] thiophene<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
6-Hydroxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl) benzo [b] thiophene hydrochloride (arzoxifene)<br>
was first described generically in U.S. Patent No. 5,510,357<br>
and was specifically disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,723,474<br>
('474) and European Patent Application 0729956. Arzoxifene<br>
is a nonsteroidal mixed estrogen antagonist/agonist, useful<br>
for, inter alia, lowering serum cholesterol and for<br>
inhibiting hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, estrogen dependent<br>
cancers including breast and uterine cancer, endometriosis,<br>
CNS disorders including Alzheimer's disease, aortal smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferation, and restenosis.<br>
Specifically, arzoxif ene is useful for, and is being<br>
clinically evaluated for the treatment of receptor positive<br>
metastatic breast cancer; the adjuvent treatment of receptor<br>
positive patients following appropriate systemic or local<br>
therapy; the reduction of recurrence of invasive and<br>
noninvasive breast cancer; and the reduction of the<br>
incidence of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in<br>
situ (DCIS) . Arzoxif ene is also useful in combination with<br>
radiotherapy, aroxnatase inhibitors, LHRH analogues, and<br>
acetyl choline esterase (AChE) inhibitors.<br>
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric<br>
analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)<br>
and Karl Fischer (KF) analyses of bulk arzoxif ene isolated<br>
by the procedures taught in '474 later indicated that said<br>
material was hydrated, poorly crystalline, and contained<br>
variable amounts of an organic volatile (ethyl acetate) in<br>
its lattice.<br>
Poorly crystalline and/or amorphous materials are<br>
typically less desirable than highly crystalline materials<br>
for formulation processing. Amorphous compounds are<br>
chemically and physically less stable as they tend to adsorb<br>
significant amounts of water. The adsorption of water by an<br>
amorphous material in a gelatin capsule, for example, may<br>
cause the capsule to shrink or buckle as moisture is<br>
transferred from the capsule to the amorphous component. In<br>
addition, amorphous compounds have a tendency to precipitate<br>
out of solutions containing them. If an amorphous drug<br>
substance precipitates from a delivery solution, the<br>
dissolution and bioavailability properties of the drug may<br>
be negatively affected.<br>
In addition, it is generally not desirable to formulate<br>
pharmaceuticals containing substantial amounts of organic<br>
solvent {e.g., ethyl acetate) due to potential solvent<br>
toxicity to the recipient thereof and changes in potency of<br>
the pharmaceutical as a function of the solvent. In<br>
addition, from a manufacturing perspective, it is also<br>
generally less desirable to prepare non-crystalline<br>
materials whenever said preparation involves a collection of<br>
the final product via filtration. Such filtrations are<br>
often more difficult to perform when the material collected<br>
is non-crystalline. Moreover, it is also generally less<br>
desirable, from a manufacturing perspective, to formulate<br>
pharmaceuticals containing substantial amounts of water<br>
(hydrates) because the level of hydration will typically be<br>
some function of the relative humidity at which the<br>
pharmaceutical is produced and stored. In other words,<br>
potency variability is typically more problematic with a<br>
hydrate relative to its anhydrous form.<br>
Although the arzoxifene prepared by the procedures<br>
taught in '474 could be used as a pharmaceutical it would be<br>
highly desired and advantageous to find a more crystalline<br>
form of arzoxifene that did not contain water nor an organic<br>
solvent within its crystal lattice which could be<br>
reproducibly and efficiently prepared on a commercial scale.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a non-solvated<br>
anhydrous crystalline form of 6-hydroxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-<br>
1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene<br>
hydrochloride (F-V) having an X-ray diffraction pattern<br>
which comprises at least one of the following peaks: 7.3 ±<br>
0.2, 15.5 ± 0.2, 15.9 ± 0.2, and 17.6 ± 0.2° in 29 when<br>
obtained from a copper radiation source.<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising F-V; one or more<br>
pharmaceutical carriers, diluents, or excipients; and<br>
optionally a stabilizing agent selected from methionine,<br>
acetylcysteine, cysteine or cysteine hydrochloride; and<br>
optionally estrogen, optionally progestin, optionally an<br>
aromatase inhibitor, optionally an LHRH analogue and<br>
optionally an acetyl choline esterase (AChE) inhibitor.<br>
In addition, the present invention is related to<br>
methods for using F-V to inhibit pathological conditions<br>
such as: uterine fibrosis, endometriosis, aortal smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferation, restenosis, breast cancer,<br>
uterine cancer, prostatic cancer, benign prostatic<br>
hyperplasia, bone loss, osteoporosis, cardiovascular<br>
disease, hyperlipidemia, CNS disorders, and Alzheimer's<br>
disease and for using F-V for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for inhibiting same.<br>
The present invention is further related to methods for<br>
using F-V to up-regulate choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)<br>
and for using F-V for the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
up-regulating same.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for<br>
preparing F-V which comprises crystallizing 6-hydroxy-3-(4-<br>
[2-(piperidin-l-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)benzo[b] thiophene hydrochloride from a<br>
crystallization solvent selected from the group consisting<br>
of: methanol or aqueous methanol, ethanol or isopropanol;<br>
and subsequently drying the resulting solid to a constant<br>
weight.<br>
Brief Description of the Figures<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
F-V may be prepared by drying, either at ambient<br>
temperature or at slightly elevated temperature, the<br>
crystalline solid isolated at ambient temperature from<br>
crystallization of arzoxifene (or any polymorph/solvate<br>
thereof) from methanol, ethanol or isopropanol or aqueous<br>
mixtures of methanol. When using ethanol or isopropanol,<br>
the water content in said solvents is preferably less than<br>
0.2% (A.C.S. spectrophotometry grade). Preferably the<br>
aqueous composition in methanol contains less than 30% by<br>
volume water. More preferably F-V is prepared by drying,<br>
either at ambient temperature or at slightly elevated<br>
temperature, the solid isolated from crystallization from<br>
aqueous methanol wherein the volume of water is between 20%<br>
and 5%. Most preferably F-V is prepared by drying at 50 to •<br>
70°C, under vacuum, the solid isolated at ambient<br>
temperature from crystallization of arzoxifene (or any<br>
polymorph/solvate thereof) from aqueous methanol wherein the<br>
water content by volume is 15%.<br>
Typically, arzoxifene may be dissolved in methanol<br>
(about 1 g solute/20 ml of solvent) and optionally heated in<br>
order to effect dissolution of the arzoxifene starting<br>
material. Once dissolution is achieved, the solution may<br>
optionally be concentrated to about 1 g of solute/5 ml of<br>
solvent, e.g., by distillation, before allowing the solution<br>
to cool slowly to room temperature. Once at room temperate,<br>
the solution may optionally be cooled further (with the aid<br>
of an ice bath or refrigeration) to between 0 and 5°C.<br>
After a sufficient amount of time has elapsed for<br>
crystallization to occur, the F-V crystals may be collected<br>
by vacuum filtration and washed with cold (about 0°C)<br>
methanol before drying to a constant weight in vacuum.<br>
Slightly elevated drying temperatures (about 50°C for 12 to<br>
48 hours) in the presence of a nitrogen purge are preferred.<br>
For commercial scale synthesis of F-V, it may be<br>
advantageous to seed the crystallization with F-V.<br>
Suitable arzoxifene starting material for the above<br>
crystallization includes, but is not limited to, S-II, F-I,<br>
F-III (solvated and non-stoichiometric hydrated crystalline<br>
forms of arzoxifene described in PCT Patent Applications<br>
PCT/US00/16332 and PCT/US00/16333, the teachings of which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference), arzoxifene prepared<br>
by the procedures taught in '474, or any mixture thereof.<br>
It is not important which form of arzoxifene one starts with<br>
because crystallization from anhydrous methanol, according<br>
to the procedures described herein, results in F-V crystals.<br>
Characterization of F-V<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric<br>
analysis (BSC/TGA), moisture sorption/desorption, and X-ray<br>
powder diffraction (XKD) methods were used to characterize<br>
F-V. TGA is a measure of the thermally induced weight loss<br>
of the material as a function of temperature. It is most<br>
commonly used to study to study desolvation processes and<br>
quantatively determine the total volatile content of a<br>
solid. DSC is a technique that is often used to screen<br>
compounds for polymorphism because the temperatures(s) at<br>
which a physical change in a material occurs is usually<br>
characteristic of that material. Moisture sorption<br>
isotherms provide evaluation of the degree of hydroscopicity<br>
associated with a given material and characterization of<br>
non-hydrates and hydrates. Lastly, XRD is a technique that<br>
detects long-range order in a crystalline material.<br>
A representative TGA trace of F-V is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Thermogravimetric analysis of F-V showed no weight loss<br>
indicating the isolation of a non-solvated crystal form.<br>
DSC analysis of F-V showed a sharp melting endotherm at 174-<br>
175°C as shown in Figure 2, which is significantly higher<br>
than that observed for F-III.<br>
The moisture sorption/desorption isotherm obtained for<br>
F-V showed a weight increase of 0.11% over the range of 0-<br>
95% RH indicating a stable anhydrous crystal form with<br>
little propensity to adsorb water or convert to a hydrated<br>
form of arzoxifene.<br>
The XRD pattern of F-V features sharp peaks and a flat<br>
baseline, indicative of highly crystalline materials. The<br>
angular peak positions in 28 and corresponding I/IO data for<br>
all peaks with intensities equal to or greater than 10% of<br>
the largest peak for F-V is tabulated in Table 1. All data<br>
in Table 1 are expressed with an accuracy of ± 0.2%.<br>
Although many of the intense reflections are generally at<br>
similar diffraction angles to those reported for S-II, F-I<br>
and F-III, each of the forms gives a different powder<br>
pattern, allowing for a clear distinction between S-II, F-I,<br>
F-III and F-V.<br>
Variable temperature x-ray powder diffraction analysis<br>
of F-V showed no significant change in the diffraction<br>
pattern up to 125°C which is consistent with the DSC profile<br>
indicating a stable crystal form.<br>
It is well known in the crystallography art that, for<br>
any given crystal form, the relative intensities of the<br>
diffraction peaks may vary due to preferred orientation<br>
resulting from factors such as crystal morphology and habit.<br>
Where the effects of preferred orientation are present, peak<br>
intensities are altered, but the characteristic peak<br>
positions of the polymorph are unchanged. See, e.g., The<br>
United States Pharmacopeia #23, National Formulary #18,<br>
pages 1843-1844, 1995. Furthermore, it is also well known<br>
in the crystallography art that, for any given crystal form,<br>
the angular peak positions may vary slightly. For example,<br>
peak positions can shift due to a variation in the<br>
temperature at which a sample is analyzed, sample<br>
displacement, or the presence or absence of an internal<br>
standard. In the present case, a peak position variability<br>
of ± 0.2 in 20 will take into account these potential<br>
variations without hindering the unequivocal identification<br>
of F-V.<br>
A well known and accepted method for searching crystal<br>
forms in the literature is the "Fink" method. The Fink<br>
method uses the four most intense lines for the initial<br>
search followed by the next four most intense lines. In<br>
accord with the Fink method, based on peak intensities as<br>
well as peak position, F-V may be identified by the presence<br>
of peaks at 7.3 ± 0.2, 15.5 ± 0.2, 15.9 ± 0.2, and 17.6 ±<br>
0.2° in 26; when the pattern is obtained from a copper<br>
radiation source. The presence of F-V may be further<br>
verified by peaks at 17.9 ± 0.2, 18.2 ± 0.2, 18.9 ± 0.2, and<br>
21.5 ± 0.2° in 28; when the pattern is obtained from a<br>
copper radiation source.<br>
F-V has several advantages over the prior art form of<br>
arzoxifene described in '474 and over F-I and F-III<br>
described in the previously incorporated by reference PCT<br>
applications. Relative to the arzoxifene produced by the<br>
procedures taught in '474, F-V is more stable at ambient<br>
temperature and is, therefore, more amenable to<br>
pharmaceutical development, i.e., development of a dosage<br>
formulation. In addition, unlike the form disclosed in<br>
'474, F-V is highly crystalline, crystalline materials are<br>
generally less hygroscopic and more stable (e.g., less prone<br>
to chemical degradation, maintains consistent potency) than<br>
amorphous materials and are, therefore, more desirable for<br>
formulation processingl Furthermore, unlike the form of<br>
arzoxifene produced by the procedures taught in '474, which<br>
contained ethyl acetate and water in its lattice, F-V<br>
contains neither.<br>
Unlike S-II, F-I and F-III, F-V is truly an anhydrous<br>
form of arzoxifene which shows no propensity to adsorb water<br>
on changes in relative humidity. Furthermore, F-V s crystal<br>
lattice is stable up to its melting temperature. Moreover,<br>
F-V has approximately a 10% higher aqueous solubility-<br>
relative to F-III and is the thermodynamically most stable<br>
known form of arzoxifene.<br>
Characterization Methods<br>
DSC analysis was performed using a TA Instruments 2920<br>
equipped with an auto-sampler and a refrigerated cooling<br>
device. The sample was enclosed in a crimped aluminum pan<br>
and analyzed vs. an empty reference pan. The heat flow was<br>
measured after equilibration at 30° C. The heating rate was<br>
5°C per minute to 300°C. A graph of heat flow vs.<br>
temperature was integrated to identify any endothermic or<br>
exothermic events.<br>
TGA analysis was performed using a TA Instruments 2950<br>
equipped with an auto-sampler. The sample was loaded onto a<br>
tared aluminum pan and the temperature was ramped from<br>
ambient to 300°C at a rate of 10°C per minute. A graph of<br>
weight percent vs. temperature was integrated to determine<br>
the percent loss.<br>
Moisture Sorption Isotherms were generated using a VTI<br>
SGA-100 flow instrument. The samples were analyzed at 25°C<br>
from 0-95% relative humidity (RH) for adsorption and from<br>
95-5% RH for desorption in steps of 5% RH. The adsorption<br>
and desorption isotherms were generated as a graph of the %<br>
weight change vs. % RH.<br>
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a<br>
Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer which was equipped<br>
with a CuKa source (X = 1.54056) operated at 50 kV and 40 mA<br>
with a Kevex solid state Si(Li) detector. The samples were<br>
scanned from 4 to 35° in 2? at 2.5 seconds per step size of<br>
0.04°. The dry powders were packed into recessed top-<br>
loading sample holders and a smooth surface was obtained<br>
using a glass slide.<br>
Variable temperature X-ray powder diffraction patterns<br>
were obtained on a Siemens D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer<br>
which was equipped with a CuKa source (? = 1.54056) operated<br>
at 50kV and 40 mA with a scintillation detector and nickel<br>
filter. The powder was packed into a top-loading, recessed<br>
temperature controlled holder and a smooth surface was<br>
obtained for diffraction. The sample was scanned from 2 to<br>
35° 20 at 2.5 seconds per step size of 0.04° beginning at<br>
25°C after an equilibration time of 5 minutes. Subsequent<br>
scans were obtained at increasing temperature increments of<br>
25°C to a maximum of 125°C.<br>
The following examples further illustrate processes for<br>
preparing F-V. The examples are not intended to be limiting<br>
to the scope of these processes in any respect, and should<br>
not be so construed.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Crystallization from Methanol Without Concentration<br>
A 20.00 g sample of arzoxifene is combined with 500 ml<br>
of anhydrous methanol (HPLC grade) and heated to reflux.<br>
All of the solids dissolve to afford a homogeneous pale<br>
yellow solution. The solution is cooled to below reflux and<br>
5.00 g of additional arzoxifene are added. The solution is<br>
re-heated to reflux to effect dissolution of all of the<br>
solids. The solution is slowly allowed to cool with<br>
agitation. At 50°C the solution is seeded with several<br>
milligrams of previously prepared F-V salt. The crystalline<br>
slurry is allowed to cool from 50°C to 30°C over a 1.25 hour<br>
period. At this point a large amount of white solids are<br>
present. The stirred slurry is immersed in an ice bath and<br>
stirred for an additional 3 hours. The slurry is filtered<br>
using Whatman #1 filter paper and the white solid is washed<br>
with 50 ml of methanol pre-chilled to 0°C. The wet cake is<br>
dried for about 48 hours at 50°C under vacuum with a slight<br>
N2 purge. Yield 15.94 g (63.8% yield). HELC potency 89.4%<br>
(as free base), total related substances (TRS) 0.28%.<br>
Comparison of the product weight before and after drying<br>
showed the initial wet cake contained 65% solvent.<br>
Example 2<br>
Crystallization from Methanol With Concentration<br>
A 25.00 g sample of arzoxifene is combined with 500 ml<br>
of anhydrous methanol (HPLC grade) and heated to reflux. All<br>
of the solids dissolved to afford a homogeneous pale yellow<br>
solution. The solution is concentrated by removal of 375 ml<br>
of distillate by atmospheric distillation. At this point,<br>
the reaction mixture is a clear homogeneous yellow solution.<br>
Reflux is broken and the solution is seeded with several<br>
milligrams of previously prepared F-V. After seeding, the<br>
mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature with slow<br>
agitation over a 1 hour period. During this time a large<br>
amount of white precipitate forms. The slurry is immersed<br>
in an ice bath and stirred for an additional 3 hours. The<br>
slurry is filtered using Whatman #1 filter paper and the<br>
white solid is washed with 50 ml of methanol pre-chilled to<br>
0°C. The wet cake is dried for about 48 hours at 50°C under<br>
vacuum with a slight N2 purge. Yield 22.44 g (89.8% yield).<br>
HPLC potency 91.3% (as free base), TRS 0.26%. Comparison of<br>
the product weight before and after drying showed the<br>
initial wet cake contained 31.5% solvent.<br>
Example 3<br>
30 Gallon Scale Recrystallization from Methanol<br>
A 3.08 kg sample of arzoxifene is combined with 60 L of<br>
anhydrous methanol (HPLC grade) and heated to reflux. All<br>
of the solids dissolved to afford a pale yellow homogeneous<br>
solution. The solution is concentrated by removal of 40 L of<br>
distillate by atmospheric distillation. At this point, the<br>
reaction mixture is a clear homogeneous yellow solution. The<br>
reaction is cooled to break reflux and the manway is opened<br>
at about 40°C to check for crystallization. Crystals are<br>
observed and cooling is continued at a rate 12°C per hour to<br>
a final temperature of 0°C. The crystallization slurry is<br>
stirred overnight at 0°C and then filtered through a single<br>
plate filter press. In order to remove all product from the<br>
crystallization tank, the mother liquor is used as a tank<br>
wash and then sent through the press. The wet cake is then<br>
washed with 11.3 L of anhydrous methanol pre-chilled to 0°C<br>
The wet cake is dried by applying vacuum to the press and<br>
running 50°C water through the jacket of the press. A<br>
slight N2 purge is applied after about 24 hours. Total<br>
drying time is about 36 hours. The yield is 2.588 kg<br>
(86.27%); HPLC potency 92.7 (as free base); TRS 6.39%.<br>
Example 4<br>

Punctilious ethanol (250 ml) and arzoxifene (10.0 g)<br>
were combined and heated to reflux to effect dissolution.<br>
The solution was allowed to cool to ambient temperature over<br>
a 3 hour period during which time a white crystalline<br>
precipitate formed. The solids were isolated by filtration<br>
and vacuum dried overnight at 50°C with a slight N2 purge.<br>
Yield 5.50 g, m.p. 173°C (by DSC). An x-ray powder<br>

Example 5<br>
Crystallization from Isopropanol<br>
Anhydrous isopropanol (250 ml) and azroxifene (10.0 g)<br>
were combined and heated to reflux to effect dissolution.<br>
Heat was removed and the solution seeded with several<br>
milligrams of F-V. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool<br>
to ambient temperature and stir overnight during which time<br>
a white precipitate formed. The solids were isolated by<br>
filtration to afford 12.11 g of wetcake. A 4.01 g sample of<br>
the wetcake was dried over night at 60°C under vacuum with a<br>
slight N2 purge. Yield 2.72 g; m.p. 171.5°C (by DSC). An<br>
x-ray powder diffraction spectrum for this sample was<br>
obtained and was substantially identical to that of the F-V<br>
pattern disclosed in Figure 3.<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation from Azroxifene Free Base<br>
Azroxifene free base (5.07 g) was slurried in 65.0 ml<br>
of methanol. A solution of 1.41 ml of concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid and 10.0 ml of water was added to the<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was heated to 55°C<br>
for 15 minutes to effect dissolution. The reaction mixture<br>
was cooled to 30°C and seeded with 50 mg of F-V- The<br>
reaction mixture was cooled to 10°C at a rate of 1°C/hr and<br>
stirred at that temperature for 8 hours. The solids were<br>
isolated by filtration, washed with methanol pre-chilled to<br>
10°C and vacuum dried at 50°C over night with a light N2<br>
purge. Yield 4.42 g (87.7% yield); potency (HPLC) 99.7%;<br>
TRS 0.32%. An x-ray powder diffraction spectrum for this<br>
sample was obtained and was substantially identical to that<br>
of the F-V pattern disclosed in Figure 3.<br>
Utilities<br>
As used herein, the term "effective amount" means an<br>
amount of F-V that is capable of inhibiting conditions, or<br>
detrimental effects thereof, described herein. When F-V is<br>
co-administered with estrogen, progestin, an aromatase<br>
inhibitor, an LHRH analogue, or an AChE inhibitor, the term<br>
"effective amount" also means an amount of such an agent<br>
capable of producing its intended effect.<br>
The terms "inhibiting" and "inhibit" include their<br>
generally accepted meaning, i.e., preventing, prohibiting,<br>
restraining, alleviating, ameliorating, slowing, stopping,<br>
or reversing the progression or severity of a pathological<br>
condition, or sequela thereof, described herein.<br>
The terms "preventing", "prevention of", "prophylaxis",<br>
"prophylactic" and "prevent" are used herein interchangeably<br>
and refer to reducing the likelihood that the recipient of<br>
F-V will incur or develop any of the pathological<br>
conditions, or sequela thereof, described herein.<br>
The terms "estrogen deprived" and "estrogen<br>
deprivation" refer to a condition, either naturally<br>
occurring or clinically induced, where a woman can not<br>
produce sufficient endogenous estrogenic hormones to<br>
maintain estrogen dependent functions, e.g., menses,<br>
homeostasis of bone mass, neuronal function, cardiovascular<br>
condition, etc. Such estrogen deprived situations arise<br>
from, but are not limited to, menopause and surgical or<br>
chemical ovarectomy, including its functional equivalent,<br>
e.g., medication with an aromatase inhibitor, GnRH agonists<br>
or antagonists, ICI 182780, and the like. Disease states<br>
associated with an estrogen deprived state include, but are<br>
not limited to: bone loss, osteoporosis, cardiovascular<br>
disease and hyperlipidemia.<br>
As used herein, the term "estrogen" includes steroidal<br>
compounds having estrogenic activity such as, for example,<br>
17ß-estradiol, estrone, conjugated estrogen (Premarin®),<br>
equine estrogen 17ß-ethynyl estradiol, and the like. A<br>
preferred estrogen-based compound is Premarin®, and<br>
norethylnodrel.<br>
As used herein, the term "progestin" includes compounds<br>
having progestational activity such as, for example,<br>
progesterone, norethylnodrel, nongestrel, megestrol acetate,<br>
lorethindrone, and the like. Norethindrone is a preferred<br>

compounds capable of inhibiting aromatase, for example<br>
commercially available inhibitors such as aminoglutemide<br>
(CYTANDREN®) , Anastrazole (ARIMIDEX®) , Letrozole (FEMARA®),<br>
Formestane (LENATRON®), Exemestane (AROMASIN®), and the<br>
like.<br>
As used herein, the term "LHRH analogue" refers to an<br>
analogue of lutenizing hormone releasing hormone that<br>
inhibits estrogen production in a premenopausal women<br>
including for example, goserlin (ZOLADEX®) , leuprolide<br>
(LUPRON®) and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term "AChE inhibitor" includes<br>
compounds that inhibit acetyl choline esterase, for example,<br>
physostigmine salicylate, tacrine hydrochloride, donepezil<br>
hydrochloride and the like.<br>
The term "up-regulate ChAT" refers to increasing the<br>
enzymatic activity of ChAT, i.e., promoting the conversion<br>
of choline to acetyl choline. This promotion would include<br>
an increase in the efficiency and/or rate of reaction of<br>
ChAT and choline and/or an increase in the amount of ChAT<br>
present at the site of action. This increase in the amount<br>
of enzyme present may be due to gene regulation or other<br>
synthetic step of the enzyme's formation and/or a decrease<br>
in the enzyme's de-activation and metabolism.<br>
Selected Testing Procedures<br>
General Rat Preparation Procedure: Seventy-five day old<br>
(unless otherwise indicated) female Sprague Dawley rats<br>
{weight range of 200 to 225g) are obtained from Charles<br>
River Laboratories (Portage, MI). The animals are either<br>
bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) or exposed to a Sham<br>
surgical procedure at Charles River Laboratories; and then<br>
shipped after one week. Upon arrival, they are housed in<br>
metal hanging cages in groups of 3 or 4 per cage and have ad<br>
libitum access to food (calcium content approximately 0.5%)<br>
and water for one week. Room temperature is maintained at<br>
22.2° ± 1.7°C with a minimum relative humidity of 40%. The<br>
photoperiod in the room was 12 hours light and 12 hours<br>
dark.<br>
Dosing Regimen Tissue Collection: After a one week<br>
acclimation period (therefore, two weeks post-OVX) daily<br>
dosing with F-V is initiated. 17a-ethynyl estradiol or F-V<br>
is given orally, unless otherwise stated, as a suspension in<br>
1% carboxymethylcellulose or dissolved in 20% cyclodextrin.<br>
Animals are dosed daily for 4 days. Following the dosing<br>
regimen, animals are weighed and anesthetized with a<br>
ketamine: Xylazine (2:1, v:v) mixture and a blood sample is<br>
collected by cardiac puncture. The animals are then<br>
sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2, the uterus is removed<br>
through a midline incision, and a wet uterine weight is<br>
determined. 17a-ethynyl estradiol is obtained from Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO.<br>
Cardiovascular Disease/Hyperlipidemia<br>
The blood samples from above are allowed to clot at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours, and serum is obtained<br>
following centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. Serum<br>
cholesterol is determined using a Boehringer Mannheim<br>
Diagnostics high performance cholesterol assay. Briefly the<br>
cholesterol is oxidized to cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen<br>
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then reacted with phenol<br>
and 4-aminophenazone in the presence of peroxidase to<br>
produce a p-quinone imine dye, which is read<br>
spectrophotemetrically at 500 run. Cholesterol concentration<br>
is then calculated against a standard curve. The entire<br>
assay is automated using a Biomek Automated Workstation.<br>
Uterine Eosinophil Peroxidase (EPO) Assay<br>
The uteri from above are kept at 4°C until time of<br>
enzymatic analysis. The uteri are then homogenized in 50<br>
volumes of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH - 8.0) containing 0.005%<br>
Triton X-100. Upon addition of 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and<br>
10 mM 0-phenylenediamine (final concentrations) in Tris<br>
buffer, increase in absorbance is monitored for one minute<br>
at 450 run. The presence of eosonophils in the uterus is an<br>
indication of estrogenic activity of a compound. The<br>
maximal velocity of a 15 second interval is determined over<br>
the initial, linear portion of the reaction curve.<br>
Inhibition of Bone Loss (Osteoporosis) Test Procedure<br>
Following the general preparation procedure described<br>
above, the rats are treated daily for thirty-five days (6<br>
rats per treatment group) and sacrificed by carbon dioxide<br>
asphyxiation on the 36th day. The thirty-five day time<br>
period is sufficient to allow maximal reduction in bone<br>
density, measured as described herein. At the time of<br>
sacrifice, the uteri are removed, dissected free of<br>
extraneous tissue, and the fluid contents are expelled<br>
before determination of wet weight in order to confirm<br>
estrogen deficiency associated with complete ovariectomy.<br>
Uterine weight is routinely reduced about 75% in response to<br>
ovariectomy. The uteri are then placed in 10% neutral<br>
buffered formalin to allow for subsequent histological<br>
analysis.<br>
The right femurs are excised and digitilized X-rays<br>
generated and analyzed by an image analysis program (NIH<br>
image) at the distal metaphysis. The proximal aspect of the<br>
tibiae from these animals are also scanned by quantitative<br>
computed tomography. In accordance with the above<br>
procedures, F-V or ethynyl estradiol (EE2) in 20%<br>
hydroxypropyl ß-cyclodextrin are orally administered to test<br>
animals. F-V is also useful in combination with estrogen<br>
or progestin.<br>
MCF-7 Proliferation Assay<br>
MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB 22) are<br>
maintained in MEM (minimal essential medium, phenol red-<br>
free, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum (FBS) (V/V) , L-glutamine (2 mM) , sodium<br>
pyruvate (1 mM), HEPES {(N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-<br>
ethanesulfonic acid]10 mM}, non-essential amino acids and<br>
bovine insulin (1 ug/mL) (maintenance medium) . Ten days<br>
prior to assay, MCF-7 cells are switched to maintenance<br>
medium supplemented with 10% dextran coated charcoal<br>
stripped fetal bovine serum (DCC-FBS) assay medium) in place<br>
of 10% FBS to deplete internal stores of steroids. MCF-7<br>
cells are removed from maintenance flasks using cell<br>
dissociation medium (Ca++/Mg++ free HBSS (phenol red-free)<br>
supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 2 mM EDTA) . Cells are<br>
washed twice with assay medium and adjusted to 80,000<br>
cells/mL. Approximately 100 mL (8,000 cells) are added to<br>
flat-bottom microculture wells (Costar 3596) and incubated<br>
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 48 hours to<br>
allow for cell adherence and equilibration after transfer.<br>
Serial dilutions of drugs or DMSO as a diluent control are<br>
prepared in assay medium and 50 mL transferred to triplicate<br>
microcultures followed by 50 mL assay medium for a final<br>
volume of 200 mL. After an additional 48 hours at 37°C in a<br>
5% CO2 humidified incubator, microcultures are pulsed with<br>
tritiated thymidine (1 uCi/well) for 4 hours. Cultures are<br>
terminated by freezing at -70°C for 24 hours followed by<br>
thawing and harvesting of microcultures using a Skatron<br>
Semiautomatic Cell Harvester. Samples are counted by liquid<br>
scintillation using a Wallac BetaPlace ß counter.<br>
DMBA-Induced Mammary Tumor Inhibition<br>
Estrogen-dependent mammary tumors are produced in<br>
female Sprague-Dawley rats which are purchased from Harlan<br>
Industries, Indianapolis, Indiana. At about 55 days of age,<br>
the rats receive a single oral feeding of 20 mg of 7,12-<br>
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). About 6 weeks after DMBA<br>
administration, the mammary glands are palpated at weekly<br>
intervals for the appearance of tumors. Whenever one or<br>
more tumors appear, the longest and shortest diameters of<br>
each tumor are measured with a metric caliper, the<br>
measurements are recorded, and that animal is selected for<br>
experimentation. An attempt is made to uniformly distribute<br>
the various sizes of tumors in the treated and control<br>
groups such that average-sized tumors are equivalently<br>
distributed between test groups. Control groups and test<br>
groups for each experiment contain 5 to 9 animals.<br>
F-V is administered either through intraperitoneal<br>
injections in 2% acacia, or orally. Orally administered<br>
compounds are either dissolved or suspended in 0.2 mL corn<br>
oil. Each treatment, including acacia and corn oil control<br>
treatments, is administered once daily to each test animal.<br>
Following the initial tumor measurement and selection of<br>
test animals, tumors are measured each week by the above-<br>
mentioned method. The treatment and measurements of animals<br>
continue for 3 to 5 weeks at which time the final areas of<br>
the tumors are determined. For each compound and control<br>
treatment, the change in the mean tumor area is determined.<br>
Uterine Fibrosis Test Procedures<br>
Test 1: Between 3 and 20 women having uterine fibrosis are<br>
administered F-V. The amount of compound administered is<br>
from 0.1 to 1000 mg/day, and the period of administration is<br>
3 months. The women are observed during the period of<br>
administration, and up to 3 months after discontinuance of<br>
administration, for effects on uterine fibrosis.<br>
Test 2: The same procedure is used as in Test 1, except the<br>
period of administration is 6 months.<br>
Test 3: The same procedure is used as in Test 1, except the<br>
period of administration is 1 year.<br>
Test 4: Prolonged estrogen stimulation is used to induce<br>
leiomyomata in sexually mature female guinea pigs. Animals<br>
are dosed with estradiol 3-5 times per week by injection for<br>
2-4 months or until tumors arise. Treatment consisting of<br>
F-V or vehicle is administered daily for 3-16 weeks and then<br>
animals are sacrificed and the uteri harvested and analyzed<br>
for tumor regression.<br>
Test 5: Tissue from human leiomyomas are implanted into the<br>
peritoneal cavity and/or uterine myometrium of sexually<br>
mature, castrated, female, nude mice. Exogenous estrogen is<br>
supplied to induce growth of the explanted tissue. In some<br>
cases, the harvested tumor cells are cultured in vitro prior<br>
to implantation. Treatment consisting of F-V or vehicle is<br>
supplied by gastric lavage on a daily basis for 3-16 weeks<br>
and implants are removed and measured for growth or<br>
regression. At the time of sacrifice, the uteri are<br>
harvested to assess the status of the organ.<br>
Test 6: Tissue from human uterine fibroid tumors is<br>
harvested and maintained, in vitro, as primary non-<br>
transformed cultures. Surgical specimens are pushed through<br>
a sterile mesh or sieve, or alternately teased apart from<br>
surrounding tissue to produce a single cell suspension.<br>
Cells are maintained in media containing 10% serum and<br>
antibiotic. Rates of growth in the presence and absence of<br>
estrogen are determined. Cells are assayed for their<br>
ability to produce complement component C3 and their<br>
response to growth factors and growth hormone. In vitro<br>
cultures are assessed for their proliferative response<br>
following treatment with progestins, GnRH, F-V, and vehicle.<br>
Levels of steroid hormone receptors are assessed weekly to<br>
determine whether important cell characteristics are<br>
maintained in vitro. Tissue from 5-25 patients is utilized.<br>
Test 7: F-V's ability to inhibit estrogen-stimulated<br>
proliferation of leiomyoma-derived ELT cell lines is<br>
measured substantially as described in Fuchs-Young, et al.,<br>
"Inhibition of Estrogen-Stimulated Growth of Uterine<br>
Leiomyomas by Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators", Mol.<br>
Car., 17(3):151-159 (1996), the teachings of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Endometriosis Test Procedures<br>
Test 1: Twelve to thirty adult CD strain female rats are<br>
used as test animals. They are divided into three groups of<br>
equal numbers. The estrous cycle of all animals is<br>
monitored. On the day of proestrus, surgery is performed on<br>
each female. Females in each group have the left uterine<br>
horn removed, sectioned into small squares, and the squares<br>
are loosely sutured at various sites adjacent to the<br>
mesenteric blood flow. In addition, females in Group 2 have<br>
the ovaries removed. On the day following surgery, animals<br>
in Groups 1 and 2 receive intraperitoneal injections of<br>
water for 14 days whereas animals in Group 3 receive<br>
intraperitoneal injections of 1.0 mg of F-V per kilogram of<br>
body weight for the same duration. Following 14 days of<br>
treatment, each female is sacrificed and the endometrial<br>
explants, adrenals, remaining uterus, and ovaries, where<br>
applicable, are removed and prepared for histological<br>
examination. The ovaries and adrenals are weighed.<br>
Test 2: Twelve to thirty adult CD strain female rats are<br>
used as test animals. They are divided into two equal<br>
groups. The estrous cycle of all animals is monitored. On<br>
the day of proestrus, surgery is performed on each female.<br>
Females in each group have the left uterine horn removed,<br>
sectioned into small squares, and the squares are loosely<br>
sutured at various sites adjacent to the mesenteric blood<br>
flow. Approximately 50 days following surgery, animals<br>
assigned to Group 1 receive intraperitoneal injections of<br>
water for 21 days whereas animals in Group 2 receive<br>
intraperitoneal injections of 1.0 mg of F-V per kilogram of<br>
body weight for the same duration. Following 21 days of<br>
treatment, each female is sacrificed and the endometrial<br>
explants and adrenals are removed and weighed. The explants<br>
are measured as an indication of growth. Estrous cycles are<br>
monitored.<br>
Test 3: Autographs of endometrial tissue are used to induce<br>
endometriosis in rats and/or rabbits. Female animals at<br>
reproductive maturity undergo bilateral oophorectomy, and<br>
estrogen is supplied exogenously thus providing a specific<br>
and constant level of hormone. Autologous endometrial<br>
tissue is implanted in the peritoneum of 5-150 animals and<br>
estrogen supplied to induce growth of the explanted tissue.<br>
Treatment consisting of a compound of the present invention<br>
is supplied by gastric lavage on a daily basis for 3-16<br>
weeks, and implants are removed and measured for growth or<br>
regression. At the time of sacrifice, the intact horn of<br>
the uterus is harvested to assess status of endometrium.<br>
Test 4: Tissue from human endometrial lesions is implanted<br>
into the peritoneum of sexually mature, castrated, female,<br>
nude mice. Exogenous estrogen is supplied to induce growth<br>
of the explanted tissue. In some cases, the harvested<br>
endometrial cells are cultured in vitro prior to<br>
implantation. Treatment consisting of F-V supplied by<br>
gastric lavage on a daily basis for 3-16 weeks, and implants<br>
are removed and measured for growth or regression. At the<br>
time of sacrifice, the uteri are harvested to assess the<br>
status of the intact endometrium.<br>
Test 5: Tissue from human endometrial lesions is harvested<br>
and maintained in vitro as primary non-transformed cultures.<br>
Surgical specimens are pushed through a sterile mesh or<br>
sieve, or alternately teased apart from surrounding tissue<br>
to produce a single cell suspension. Cells are maintained<br>
in media containing 10% serum and antibiotic. Rates of<br>
growth in the presence and absence of estrogen are<br>
determined. Cells are assayed for their ability to produce<br>
complement component C3 and their response to growth factors<br>
and growth hormone. In vitro cultures are assessed for<br>
their proliferative response following treatment with<br>
progestins, GnRH, F-V, and vehicle. Levels of steroid<br>
hormone receptors are assessed weekly to determine whether<br>
important cell characteristics are maintained in vitro.<br>
Tissue from 5-25 patients is utilized.<br>
CNS Disorders Including Alzheimer's Disease<br>
Estrogens, such as 17ß-estradiol, regulate gene<br>
transcription by binding to estrogen receptors (ER) which<br>
reside in the cytoplasm of certain cell populations. Ligand<br>
activation of the ER is a prerequisite for nuclear transport<br>
of the complex where binding to a 13 base-pair palindromic<br>
DNA consensus sequence (estrogen response element,, or ERE)<br>
begins assembly of a transcriptional apparatus which<br>
culminates in the activation of appropriate target genes. A<br>
variety of genes have been identified which are regulated by<br>
estrogen. These include cytoskeletal proteins, neuro-<br>
transmitter biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes and<br>
receptors, as well as other hormones and neuropeptides.<br>
ERE's have been identified in many estrogen-responsive genes<br>
including vitellogenin, c-fos, prolactin, and luteinizing<br>
hormone.<br>
Of significance in the central nervous system, ERE-like<br>
sequences have been identified in p75ngr and trkA, both of<br>
which serve as signaling molecules for the neurotrophins:<br>
nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived nerve growth factor<br>
(BDNGF), and neurotrophin-3.<br>
BDNF as well as NGF have been shown to promote the<br>
survival of cholinergic neurons in culture. It is<br>
postulated that if the interactions between neurotrophins<br>
and estrogens are important for the development and survival<br>
of basal forebrain neurons (which degenerate in Alzheimer's<br>
disease) then clinical conditions in which an estrogen<br>
deficiency exists (as after menopause) may contribute to a<br>
loss of these neurons.<br>
The following experiment is conducted in ovariectomized<br>
rats (prepared as described above) to determine the<br>
similarities and/or differences between F-V and estrogen at<br>
affecting gene expression in various brain regions. Six<br>
week old rats are dosed daily with subcutaneous injections<br>
of estradiol benzoate (0.03 mg/kg), F-V or vehicle<br>
(control) . After five weeks of treatment, animals are<br>
sacrificed and their brains removed and hippocampi collected<br>
by microdissection. The hippocampi are fast frozen in<br>
liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Total RNA is prepared<br>
from pooled tissue from the appropriate treatment and<br>
control groups and reverse transcribed using a 3'<br>
oligonucleotide primer which is selected for specific mRNA<br>
(poly-A+) populations. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) are<br>
carried out in a cocktail consisting of: random 5'<br>
oligonucleotides (10 base-pairs in length; total of 150),<br>
reaction buffer, Tag polymerase, and a 32PdTCP.<br>
After 40 rounds of amplification, the reaction products<br>
are size fractionated on a 6% TBE-urea gel, dried and<br>
exposed to X-ray film. The resulting mRNA display patterns<br>
are compared between treatment groups.<br>
Use of F-V in Conjunction with Estrogen<br>
Peri- and post-menopausal women often undergo hormone<br>
replacement therapy (HRT) to combat negative consequences<br>
associated with the drop in circulating endogenous estrogen,<br>
e.g., to treat hot flashes. However, HRT has been<br>
associated with increased risks of certain cancers including<br>
uterine and breast cancer. F-V may be employed in<br>
conjunction with HRT to inhibit these risks.<br>
Use of F-V in Conjunction With an Aromatase Inhibitor<br>
By definition, the ovaries of a postmenopausal woman<br>
are not functioning. Her only source of estrogen is through<br>
conversion of adrenal androgens to estrogens by the enzyme<br>
aromatase, which is found in peripheral tissues (including<br>
fat, muscle and the breast tumor itself). Thus, drugs that<br>
inhibit aromatase (aromatase inhibitors) deplete the<br>
postmenopausal woman of circulating estrogen. Estrogen<br>
deprivation by means of aromatase inhibition is an important<br>
treatment option for patients with metastatic breast cancer.<br>
During therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, lack of<br>
circulating estrogen may cause negative, unintended side-<br>
effects, for example on serum lipid levels. F-V may be<br>
employed to inhibit these negative effects.<br>
Use of F-V in Conjunction with a LHRH Analogue<br>
Continuous exposure to a LHRH (lutenizing hormone<br>
releasing hormone) analogue inhibits estrogen production in<br>
the premenopausal women by desensitizing the pituitary<br>
gland, which then no longer stimulates the ovaries to<br>
produce estrogen. The clinical effect is a "medical<br>
oophrectomy" which is reversible upon cessation of the LHRH<br>
analogue. During therapy with a LHRH analogue, lack of<br>
circulating estrogen may cause negative, unintended side-<br>
effects, for example on serum lipid levels. F-V may be<br>
employed to inhibit these negative effects.<br>
Increasing Levels of Acetyl Choline<br>
It is known that patients suffering from Alzheimer's<br>
disease have a markedly smaller level of cholinergic neurons<br>
in the hippocampus than their non-Alzheimer peers. The<br>
progressive loss of these cholinergic neurons appears to<br>
mirror the progressive loss in memory and cognitive function<br>
in these patients. It is thought that one reason for the<br>
decline of these neurons is the loss or decreased function<br>
of the neurotransmitter, acetyl choline.<br>
The level of acetylcholine in a neuron is basically<br>
determined by where the equilibrium between its bio-<br>
synthesis and bio-degradation lies. The enzyme choline<br>
acetyltransferase (ChAT) is primarily responsible for its<br>
synthesis and acetylcholineesterase (AChE) for its<br>
degradation.<br>
In the order to determine F-V's effect on levels of<br>
ChAT, the following experiment is performed: Following the<br>
general rat preparation procedure described above, 40 rats<br>
are dosed daily by subcutaneous injection or oral gavage<br>
with F-V at 3 mg/kg/day in a vehicle containing 10%<br>
cyclodextrin, estradiol benzoate at 0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg/day,<br>
or vehicle control. Animals are treated for 3 or 10 days.<br>
There are twenty animals per each dosing regimen. At the<br>
appropriate time intervals, the animals are sacrificed and<br>
their brains dissected. The particular portions of the<br>
brains are homogenized and assayed. Homogenates from the<br>
hippocampus and frontal cortex were processed and<br>
determination of ChAT activity is made by a radio-labelled<br>
assay of the bio-synthesis of acetyl choline. This<br>
procedure may be found in Schoepp et al., J. Neural<br>
Transmiss., 78:183-193, 1989, the teachings of which are<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
As expected, in the OVX animals, ChAT levels are<br>
reduced &gt;50% (p
controls.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, F-V is<br>
used in combination with an AChE inhibitor. Use of an AChE<br>
inhibitor increases levels of acetylcholine by blocking its<br>

1998.<br>
In the experiments described below, the ability of F-V<br>
to bind at estrogen receptors in several human prostatic<br>
cancer cell lines is evaluated.<br>
Lysates of the LNCaP, DU-45 and PC-3 human prostatic<br>
cancer cell lines are prepared in a TEG medium comprising 50<br>
nM Tris•HCl pH 7.4, 1.5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA) 0.4 M KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM 2-ME, and 10 mM<br>
sodium molybdate further containing the protease inhibitors<br>
pepstatin (1 mg/mL), leupeptin (2 mg/mL), aprotinin (5<br>
mg/mL) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 0.1 mM)<br>
(TEGP).<br>
The cell lysates are centrifuged and the pellets<br>
resuspended in cold TEGP (1 mL TEGP/100 mg of pellet) and<br>
sonicated for 30 seconds (duty cycle 70%, output 1.8) on a<br>
Branson Model 450 Sonifier. Lysates are pelleted by<br>
centrifugation at 10,000 x G for 15 minutes at 4°C after<br>
which the supernates are withdrawn and either used<br>
immediately or stored at -70°C.<br>
Competitive Binding Assay: The binding buffer is TEG in<br>
which the 0.4 M KCl is replaced by 50 mM NaCl and to which 1<br>
mg/mL of ovalbumin had been further added (TEGO) . F-V is<br>
diluted to 20 nM in TEGO from which 3-fold serial dilutions<br>
are prepared. Assays are performed in round-bottom<br>
polyprolylene microplates in triplicate microwells. Each<br>
well receives 35 mL of tritiafeed 17ß-estradiol (0.5 nM,<br>
specific activity 60.1 Ci/mmol, DuPont-New England Nuclear,<br>
Boston, MA) and 35 mL of cold competitot test compound (0.1<br>
nM - 5 mM) or TEGO, and following incubation for 5 minutes<br>
at 4°C with shaking, 70 mL of MCF-7 cell line lysate.<br>
Plates are incubated for 24 hours at 4°C after which<br>
time 70 mL of dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) is added to each<br>
well followed by vigorous shaking for 8 minutes at 4°C. The<br>
plates are then centrifuged at 1500 x G for 10 minutes at<br>
4°C. Supernate is harvested from each well into a flexible<br>
polystyrene microplate for scintillation counting in a<br>
Wallac Micobeta Model 1450 counter. Radioactivity is<br>
expressed as disintegrations per minute (DPM) after<br>
correcting for counting efficiency (35-40%) and background.<br>
Additional controls are total counts and total counts + DCC<br>
to defined the lower limit of DCC extractable counts. The<br>
results of these competitive binding assays are expressed as<br>
mean percent bound (% Bound) +/- standard deviation using<br>
the formula:<br>
Prevention of Breast Cancer<br>
This invention also relates to the administration of F-<br>
V to a recipient who is at risk of developing de novo breast<br>
cancer. The term "de novo", as used herein, means the lack<br>
of transformation or metamorphosis of normal breast cells to<br>
cancerous or malignant cells in the first instance. Such a<br>
transformation may occur in stages in the same or daughter<br>
cells via an evolutionary process or may occur in a single,<br>
pivotal event. This de novo process is in contrast to the<br>
metastasis, colonization, or spreading of already<br>
transformed or malignant cells from the primary tumor site<br>
to new locations.<br>
A person who is at no particular risk of developing<br>
breast cancer is one who may develop de novo breast cancer,<br>
has no evidence or suspicion of the potential of the disease<br>
above normal risk, and who has never had a diagnosis of<br>
having the disease. The greatest risk factor contributing<br>
to the development of breast carcinoma is a personal history<br>
of suffering from the disease, or an earlier occurrence of<br>
the disease, even if it is in remission with no evidence of<br>
its presence. Another risk factor is family history of the<br>
disease.<br>
Induction of mammary tumors in rats by administration<br>
of the carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea is a well-accepted<br>
animal model for the study of breast cancer and has been<br>
found suitable for analyzing the effect of chemopreventive<br>
agents.<br>
In two separate studies, 55-day old female Sprague-<br>
Dawley rats are given an intravenous (Study 1) or<br>
intraperitoneal (Study 2) dose of 50 mg of N-nitroso-N-<br>
methylurea per kilogram of body weight one week prior to<br>
feeding ad libitum a diet into which varying amounts of F-V,<br>
(Z)-2-[4-(1, 2-diphenyl-l-butenyl)phenoxy] -N,N-<br>
dimethylethanamine base (tamoxifen base), or control are<br>
blended.<br>
In Study 1, the dietary doses of 60 mg/kg of diet and<br>
20 mg/kg of diet translates into roughly comparable doses of<br>
3 and 1 mg/kg of body weight for the test animals.<br>
In Study 2, the dietary doses of 20, 6, 2, and 0.6<br>
mg/kg of diet translates roughly into comparable doses of 1,<br>
0.3, 0.1 and 0.03 mg/kg of body weight for the test animals.<br>
Rats are observed for evidence of toxicity and are<br>
weighed and palpated for tumor formation once a week. The<br>
animals are sacrificed after thirteen weeks (Study 1) or<br>
eighteen weeks (Study 2) and tumors are confirmed and<br>
weighed at autopsy.<br>
Formulations<br>
The term "pharmaceutical" when used herein as an<br>
adjective means substantially non-deleterious to the<br>
recipient mammal. By "pharmaceutical formulation" it is<br>
meant the carrier, diluent, excipients and active<br>
ingredient(s) must be compatible with the other ingredients<br>
of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient<br>
thereof.<br>
F-V is preferably formulated prior to administration.<br>
The selection of the formulation should be decided by the<br>
attending physician taking into considerations the same<br>
factors involved with determining the effective amount.<br>
The total active ingredients in such formulations<br>
comprises from 0.1% to 99.9% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Preferably, no more than two active ingredients are<br>
contained in said formulation. That is, it is preferred to<br>
formulate F-V with a second active ingredient selected from<br>
an estrogen, progestin, aromatase inhibitor, LHKH analogue<br>
and AChE inhibitor. Most preferred formulations are those<br>
where F-V is the sole active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention<br>
are prepared by procedures known in the art using well known<br>
and readily available ingredients. For example, F-V, either<br>
alone, or in combination with an estrogen, progestin,<br>
aromatase inhibitor, LHRH analogue, or an AChE inhibitor<br>
compound, are formulated with common excipients, diluents,<br>
or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules, suspensions,<br>
solutions, injectables, aerosols, powders, and the like.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for<br>
parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous or non-<br>
aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions,<br>
as well as sterile powders which are reconstituted<br>
immediately prior to use into sterile solutions or<br>
suspensions. Examples of suitable sterile aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include<br>
water, physiological saline solution, ethanol, polyols (such<br>
as glycerol, propylene glycol, poly(ethylene glycol), and<br>
the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils<br>
(such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as<br>
ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity is maintained, for example,<br>
by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the<br>
maintenance of proper particle size in the case of<br>
dispersions and suspensions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
Parenteral compositions may also contain adjuvants such<br>
as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and<br>
dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms is ensured by the inclusion of antibacterial<br>
and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol,<br>
phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable<br>
to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride,<br>
and the like. Prolonged absorption of injectable<br>
formulations may be brought about by the inclusion of agents<br>
which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and<br>
gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the<br>
drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug<br>
following subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may<br>
be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of<br>
crystalline material of low water solubility or by<br>
dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. In the<br>
case of the subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of a<br>
suspension containing a form of the drug with low water<br>
solubility, the rate of absorption of the drug depends upon<br>
its rate of dissolution.<br>
Injectable "depot" formulations of F-V are made by<br>
forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in<br>
biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic acid),<br>
poly(glycolic acid), copolymers of lactic and glycolic acid,<br>
poly (orthoesters), and poly (anhydrides) these materials<br>
which are described in the art. Depending upon the ratio of<br>
drug to polymer and the characteristics of the particular<br>
polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be<br>
controlled.<br>
Injectable formulations are sterilized, for example, by<br>
filtration through bacterial-retaining filters, or by<br>
presterilization of the components of the mixture prior to<br>
their admixture, either at the time of manufacture or just<br>
prior to administration (as in the example of a dual chamber<br>
syringe package).<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include<br>
capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such<br>
solid dosage forms, F-V is mixed with at least one inert,<br>
pharmaceutical carrier such as sodium citrate, or dicalcium<br>
phosphate, and/or (a) fillers or extenders such as starches,<br>
sugars including lactose and glucose, mannitol, and silicic<br>
acid, (b) binding agents such as carboxymethyl-cellulose and<br>
other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin,<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidine), sucrose and acacia, (c) humectants<br>
such as glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents such as agar-<br>
agar, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potato or<br>
tapioca starch, alginic acid, silicates and sodium<br>
carbonate, (e) moisturizing agents such as glycerol; (f)<br>
solution retarding agents such as paraffin, (g) absorption<br>
accelerating agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds,<br>
(h) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerin<br>
monostearate, (i) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite<br>
clay, and (j) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, solid poly(ethylene glycols), sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of<br>
capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also<br>
contain buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also comprise<br>
the fill in- soft or hard gelatin capsules using excipients<br>
such as lactose as well as high molecular weight<br>
poly(ethylene glycols) and the like.<br>
Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules,<br>
pills and granules can also be prepared with coatings or<br>
shells such as enteric coatings or other coatings well known<br>
in the pharmaceutical formulating art. The coatings may<br>
contain opacifying agents or agents which release the active<br>
ingredient(s) in a particular part of the digestive tract,<br>
as for example, acid soluble coatings for release of the<br>
active ingredient(s) in the stomach, or base soluble<br>
coatings for release of the active ingredient(s) in the<br>
intestinal tract.<br>
The active ingredient(s) may also be microencapsulated<br>
in a sustained-release coating, with the microcapsules being<br>
made part of a pill of capsule formulation.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of F-V<br>
include solution, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active components, liquid<br>
formulations may include inert diluents commonly used in the<br>
art such as water or other pharmaceutical solvents,<br>
solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol,<br>
benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol,<br>
dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, ground<br>
nut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, poly(ethylene glycols), fatty<br>
acid esters of sorbitol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the liquid oral formulations<br>
may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents,<br>
emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening,<br>
flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Liquid suspension, in addition to the active<br>
ingredient(s) may contain suspending agents such as<br>
ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol<br>
and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum<br>
metahydroxide, bentonite clay, agar-agar, and tragacanth,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compositions for rectal or intravaginal administration<br>
are prepared by mixing F-V with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or any<br>
suppository wax which is a solid at room temperature, but<br>
liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum<br>
or vaginal cavity to release the active component(s). The<br>
compounds are dissolved in the melted wax, formed into the<br>
desired shape, and allowed to harden into the finished<br>
suppository formulation.<br>
F-V may also be administered in the form of liposomes.<br>
As is know in the art, liposomes are generally derived from<br>
phospholipids or other lipid substances. Lipososome<br>
formulations are formed by mono- or multilamellar hydrated<br>
liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium.<br>
Any non-toxic, pharmaceutical, and metabolizable lipid<br>
capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present<br>
compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to F-<br>
V, stabilizers, excipients, preservatives, and the like.<br>
The preferred lipids are phospholipids and the phosphatidyl<br>
cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic.<br>
Methods for forming liposomes are know in the art as<br>
described, for example, in Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell<br>
Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N. Y. (1976),.<br>
p. 33 et seq.<br>
The following formulation examples are illustrative<br>
only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Formulation 1: Tablets containing approximately 10 and 50<br>
ings, respectively, of F-V may be prepared as follows:<br>
The components are blended and compressed to form tablets.<br>
Alternatively, tablets each containing 2.5 - 1000 mg of<br>
F-V are made up as follows:<br>
F-V, starch, and cellulose are passed through a No. 45 mesh<br>
U.S. sieve and mixed thoroughly. The solution of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone is mixed with the resultant powders<br>
which are then passed through a No. 14 mesh U.S. sieve. The<br>
granules so produced are dried at 50°-60°C and passed<br>
through a No. 18 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl<br>
starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed<br>
through a No. 60 U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules<br>
which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet machine to<br>
yield tablets.<br>
Suspensions each containing 0.1 - 1000 mg of medicament<br>
per 5 ml dose are made as follows:<br>
The medicament is passed through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve<br>
and mixed with the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and syrup<br>
to form a smooth paste. The benzoic acid solution, flavor,<br>
and color are diluted with some of the water and added, with<br>
stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce the<br>
required volume.<br>
The solution of the above ingredients is intravenously<br>
administered to a patient at a rate of about 1 mL per<br>
minute.<br>
Formulation 5: Tablets Containing Cysteine Hydrochloride<br>
Core tablets weighing approximately 250 mg and<br>
containing approximately 10 mg or 20 mg of F-V are prepared<br>
generally as follows. The F-V, water soluble diluents<br>
(lactose monohydrate and anhydrous lactose), and a portion<br>
of the distintegrant (crospovidone) are blended in a high<br>
shear granulator. This blend is then wet massed in the high<br>
shear granulator with an aqueous solution of povidone and<br>
polysorbate 80. The cysteine hydrochloride is also<br>
dissolved in the granulation solution and added during the<br>
wet mass step via the granulation solution. To maintain a<br>
constant tablet fill weight, the amount of lactose (lactose<br>
monohydrate and anhydrous lactose) is reduced corresponding<br>
to the amount of cysteine hydrochloride added. Following a<br>
wet sizing step through a rotating impeller mill, the<br>
granules are dried using a fluid bed dryer. The dried<br>
granules are reduced to a suitable size with a rotating impeller mill. The remaining ingredients (microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, magnesium stearate, and rest of the crospovidone)<br>
are added to the dried granules and blended. This mixture<br>
is then compressed into round shaped tablets using a<br>
conventional rotary tablet press. The unit formulae for<br>
each of these lots are summarized in Table 2 which includes<br>
the amounts (mg/tablet) and type of excipient utilized in<br>
each case. As seen from the table, the tablet cores for<br>
lots C and D included the application of a film coat which<br>
is applied via an aqueous dispersion in a side-vented<br>
coating pan fitted to a commercial air-handling unit.<br>
Formulation 6: Tablets Containing Methionine<br>
Core tablets weighing approximately 250 mg and<br>
containing approximately 1 mg of F-V are prepared generally<br>
as follows. F-V, water soluble diluents (lactose<br>
monohydrate and anhydrous lactose), and a portion of the<br>
distintegrant (crospovidone) are blended in a high shear<br>
granulator. This blend is then wet massed in the high shear<br>
granulator with an aqueous solution of the povidone and<br>
polysorbate 80. The methionine is also dissolved in the<br>
granulation solution and added during the wet mass step via<br>
the granulation solution. To maintain a constant tablet<br>
fill weight, the amount of lactose (lactose monohydrate and<br>
anhydrous lactose) is reduced corresponding to the amount of<br>
stabilizer added. Following a wet sizing step through a<br>
rotating impeller mill, the granules are dried using a fluid<br>
bed dryer. The dried granules are reduced to a suitable<br>
size with a rotating impeller mill. The remaining<br>
ingredients (microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate,<br>
and the rest of crospovidone) are added to the dried<br>
granules and blended. This mixture is then compressed into<br>
round shaped tablets using a conventional rotary tablet<br>
press. The unit formulae for each of these lots are<br>
summarized in Table 3 which includes the amounts (mg/tablet)<br>
and type of excipient utilized in each case.<br>
Dosage<br>
The specific dose of F-V administered according to this<br>
invention is determined by the particular circumstances<br>
surrounding each situation. These circumstances include,<br>
the route of administration, the prior medical history of<br>
the recipient, the pathological condition or symptom being<br>
treated, the severity of the condition/symptom being<br>
treated, and the age and sex of the recipient.<br>
Generally, an effective minimum daily dose of F-V is<br>
about 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg. Typically, an effective<br>
maximum dose is about 800, 100, 60, 50, or 40 mg. Most<br>
typically, the dose ranges between 15 mg and 60 mg. The<br>
exact dose may be determined, in accordance with the<br>
standard practice in the medical arts of "dose titrating"<br>
the recipient; that is, initially administering a low dose<br>
of the compound, and gradually increasing the does until the<br>
desired therapeutic effect is observed.<br>
Although it may be necessary to dose titrate the<br>
recipient with respect to the combination therapies<br>
discussed above, typical doses of active ingredients other<br>
than F-V are as follows: ethynyl estrogen (0.01 - 0.03<br>
mg/day), mestranol (0.05 - 0.15 mg/day), conjugated<br>
estrogenic hormones (e.g., Premarin®, Wyeth-Ayerst; 0.3 -<br>
2.5 mg/day), medroxyprogesterone (2.5 -10 mg/day),<br>
norethylnodrel (1.0 - 10.0 mg/day), nonethindrone (0.5 - 2.0<br>
mg/day) , aminoglutemide (250-1250 mg/day, preferably 250 mg<br>
four times per day), anastrazole (1-5 mg/day, preferably 1<br>
mg once per day), letrozole (2.5-10 mg/day, preferably 2.5<br>
mg once a day), formestane (250-1250 mg per week, preferably<br>
250 mg twice weekly), exemestane (25-100 mg/day, preferably<br>
25 mg once per day) , goserlin (3-15 mg/three months,<br>
preferably 3.6-7.2 mg once every three months) and<br>
leuprolide (3-15 mg/month, preferably 3.75-7.5 mg once every<br>
month).<br>
Route of administration<br>
F-V can be administered by a variety of routes<br>
including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneus,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. The method of<br>
administration of each estrogen- and progestin-based agent<br>
is consistent with that which is known in the art. F-V,<br>
alone or in combination with estrogen, progestin, or an AChE<br>
inhibitor generally will be administered in a convenient<br>
formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may<br>
be administered to humans and other mammals (e.g., dogs,<br>
cats, horses, swine and the like) orally, rectally,<br>
intravaginally, parenterally, topically, bucally or<br>
sublingually, or nasally. The term "parenteral<br>
administration" refers herein to modes of administration<br>
which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,<br>
instrasternal, subcutaneous, or intraarticular injection or<br>
infusion.<br>
Mode/Length of Administration<br>
For the majority of the methods of the present<br>
invention, F-V is administered continuously, from. 1 to 3<br>
times daily or as often as needed to deliver an effective<br>
amount of F-V to the recipient. Cyclical therapy may<br>
especially be useful in the treatment of endometriosis or<br>
may be used acutely during painful attacks of the disease.<br>
In the case of restenosis, therapy may be limited to short<br>
(1-6 months) intervals following medical procedures such as<br>
angioplasty.<br>
